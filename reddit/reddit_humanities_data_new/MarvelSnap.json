            "Still fairly new to the game. I hear people on YT playing using the phrase \"on curve\". Also the word \"split\" on a card design. Can anyone explain the terminology? Thanks in advance!",
            "Do $29 and $99 ever return to store? I missed a bundle I wanted to buy and now I'm sad about it (Symbiont Black Widow)",
            "How does summoning at a random location work in terms of probability? Is it based on number of open spaces or split evenly with all available locations? \n\nLike let's say I discard wolverine and the left location has 1 spot open, the middle is wide open, and the right has 1 card in it. Is it equally likely to go in all locations or more likely to go into the middle > right > left? \n\nI believe it has equal chance since it essentially has 1 \"available spot\" in each location since it only takes up one spot, but thought I'd check if someone has demonstrated this.",
            "Are there any good low budget (CL1300) decks with Wong out there? Bought the bundle hoping to get something going with Wong+Tiger+Odin but I don't understand how to fill the rest of the deck and all the videos I see online are extremely outdated\n\nStruggling with winning now that I hit infinite and everyone just bodies me, lost \\~10 games in a row to insane combos. I hit infinite with Thena Disrupt deck which is basically \"disable everything they have\" through Echo+Cosmo+Goose but it stopped working so I figured the ol' reliable might be a solution",
            "Question about the 700-900g borders in the shop!\n\nIf I purchase a gold one and put it on...whatever, an Angela variant. That means any future Angela card I get will have that border as an option? Or is it just one at a time, but can be swapped between any Angela card at any moment?\n\nI picked up two already when they went on sale but haven't connected them to cards yet as I wasn't sure if they were locked to a variant or split and didn't want to make a rash choice! So just wanted clarification from those who know firsthand!",
            "I have the challenge to win all three locations today for season pass challenge and it\u2019s driving me nuts, every time I\u2019m about to win them all the other player retreats and I don\u2019t get it.. how do you guys do this one?",
            "Will arishem give credit for the weekly token quest if the spotlight card gets randomly added to your deck?",
            "How does one change their player name to something else? Every time I want to change my name to something I want it to be, it does not go through.",
            "Is the order that you get series 3 cards ACTUALLY random because I really have a hard time believing that it is. I'm conveniently still missing a ton of actually useful series 3 cards and the shop conveniently keeps pushing them to me in bundles for $15 - $20 every month. The amount of times the game has tried to get me to buy Hela, She Hulk, and Wong (not the current variant bundle I get \"for you\" bundles for him too) is amazing considering I'm pulling cards like Silver Samurai and Bast/Mysterio in a row (two recent conquest variants). It just seems super fishy to me.\n\nI'm just really frustrated with how slow the series 3 grind is because I'm basically forced into playing the same two decks over and over for weeks because I don't have any other cards.",
            "When are we getting more than 20 deck slots? And what about deck folders (to organize: classics, new cards, etc.). With new cards every week, 20 decks are too few.\n\nAlso on decks: how about reverse search? Pick a card and see what decks you have that in.",
            "Can anyone recommend decks for Conquest they've had success with? I'm getting destroyed at the moment lol.",
            "No",
            "Playing a specific card \"On Curve\" means playing the card on the first turn possible to play it. In general playing \"on curve\" means youre always using all your energy each turn\n\nA \"Split\" is what happens after you upgrade a card to Infinite border. You \"split\" it to get a new cosmetic version of the card with a background and flair effect",
            "Playing \"on curve\" means playing a card(s) each turn to maximize your energy 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n\"Split\" refers to once leveling a card to maximum Infinite level you can split it to get another of the same card with different background/effects and then continue leveling that card. You can split a card multiple times.",
            "Bundle variants have never been re-released, and SD has said that they don't plan to do so in the future.",
            "number of open spots doesnt matter",
            "Any given location only has either 1 or 0 open spots at any given time. You can\u2019t have a card put in the bottom-right of an empty location - those later slots only open up once there are cards in the earlier spots.\n\nSo a card going to a random location is equally likely to go to any locations with an open slot.",
            "What do you get with your collection when you autocomplete with Wong/WT/Odin? \u00a0The usual complements for maximum popoff potential with wong are magik, mystique and absorbing man. \u00a0It can fall apart to disruptive decks, though.",
            "If you have Mystique & Magik, can play Magik > Wong > Mystique > White Tiger > Odin.\n\nThis won\u2019t work reliably at higher collection levels, but should be good for where you\u2019re currently at.",
            "Mr negative is pretty good with wong. You can run surfer, ironheart, brood and just random 3 cost on reveal stuff if it\u2019s a surfer deck, or lean more into negative synergy with iron man, mystique, etc.",
            "The borders get assigned to a card, and then it\u2019s unlocked for that card forever. \u00a0Any variant of that card can pick that border in the custom card config. \u00a0You can change it out and change it back no issues.",
            "Just forget that you're trying to do it. You've got over a week, if you're just doing your dailies, it'll happen at some point.",
            "missions to use a specific card almost always say \"with x card starting in your deck\" - so no, cards added to the deck by arishem won't count",
            "The devs aren\u2019t here. Try asking in Discord",
            "I\u2019ve been doing good with hand-attack/mill (which is probably very matchup dependent) and zola destroy.",

            "I am glad she is out it gives me one more week to save keys",
            "Awesome card! She is really going to help me save some keys",
            "This is the perfect example of a card that should be a series 4 at launch.  \n\nIt will likely have some use, especially in Surfer decks.  But the potential free four points doesn't justify replacing a card in most other decks.\n\nCould be a fun card to play around with and try to come up with other uses, but not for 6k tokens.",
            "Wanted Gladiator, had 3 keys so went for it. I got Makkari and Gladiator next. Ok new card, let\u2019s try it out. First game, Makkari immediately runs to the space throne\u2026",
            "m baku but bigger in power  and better functionality  lolXD",
            "Why is this not a series 3 release. We need few of those here and then.",
            "I think players are overstating the risk of her running into a bad location. There are good locations to run to as well. Just won a game in part because she landed in Quantum Realm, bypassing the power loss.\n\nI was going to get her for C3, then was going to skip her because I don't believe in C4... at the last minute I realized there's a synergy with Sersi, who's been losing me ranks but a lot of fun. Sersi magnifies the power of cost reduction. Makkari is free, but she's \"just\" a stat stick, and a small stat stick at that. Re-rolling into a random 4-cost starts looking like better value.\n\nProbably still mostly niche. But I think better than the community-average opinion of her. Location risk is scary but lower in practice, with potential high upside as well.",
            "I just want to say that I really appreciate that this card is getting people to try decks that I haven\u2019t seen much of before, instead of just a card that people slot into existing archetypes.\n\nMoon Girl stuff, Strong Guy stuff, off-meta Surfer, Storm/Legion, midrange tempo. I\u2019ve seen some pretty cool brews since she was released and I think that\u2019s a good thing for the game overall. \n\nNot every new release needs to shape the meta.",
            "I just don\u2019t see any deck for this card. Surfer? Too crowded, doesnt really edge anything else? Cerebro? C4? Ehhhh. It just feels dead on release.",
            "Hot Location: Bar with No Name",
            "I'm not using my keys for her, but for X-23 lmao.\n\nImagine if she get +1 every turn, but she has too move around like Silk does.\n\nI wouldn't say it's good, but at least it has more than whatever this is.",
            "Would love to have Makkari for my Sandman deck.\u00a0 There might be a good supergiant deck with her also.\u00a0 Decks that want early priority or points without combos.\u00a0",
            "Pulled because I needed x23 and gladiator, ended up with makkari. Less disappointing than the Kang I got on the random pull",
            "Haven't seen her in 4 hours of playing.",
            "I'm gonna have SO many keys saved up for July",

            "They're definitely gonna buff her if she's as lackluster as people think she'll be, so I'm fine pulling for her since I think she'll be decent and I want those variants. Hoping they buff to 5 power for Cerebro compatibility.",
            "Are people in the comments forgetting that Glad is S4 now?",
            "So I can't explain my reasoning, but I just have this weird feeling that she's gonna be good. A part of me just thinks we're all underrating being able to have a *free* card.\n\nThat said, I'm probably wrong, and this card is gonna be just as bad as everyone says it is.",
            "The x23 variant is tempting but i should really save my keys",

            "Happy X-23 Day to those who celebrate",
            "I do think people are underrating this card. As in, people think it's a 2/10 card when in reality it's like a 6/10.",
            "Unfortunately I don\u2019t have X-23 so I might end up wasting a key on this card. Hoping I just pull X-23 first, or Gladiator then X-23",
            "There's absolutely no way they don't buff this dogshit card",
            "The cache design on this is weird.\n\nX-23's been in a lot (5th including her release) and the last one she was in also had Gladiator. So, if you got one, but not both last time, not a lot of incentive to pull here.\n\nAlso that cache was the release of Corvus Glaive, a popular and strong card. While this one has a card that neither deck she wants to be in (Surfer or C3*) particularly wants to run her.\n\nI don't know who this is aimed at besides players who weren't playing in February or lacked caches then. But, even those players would probably be bettered serviced next week by the Corvus rerun with Phastos.\n\n*forgot about the +1 power buff when I wrote this.",
            "So, i was really planning on pulling since im playing destroy a lot atm and really would lik so have x23 - right now im not 100% right now. i mean gladiator is also nice to have?",
            "Gladi boi looks good but not worth the risk for me. I'm out.",
            "Man, I want to play this in Shaw Surfer, but any sort of lane clogging would make this a disadvantage",
            "Makari is ehhh to me but picking up x23 and gladiator for anyone new is solid a hell",
            "So far, she is great in moon girl combo decks that want to have < 3 cards in hand when played (shulk, death, mockingbird, daken, proxima lists) Also messing around with apoc-less dracula, for the same reason. Lowers variance",
            "If you saw Bar with No Name and Space Throne, you could just pay for Makarri's cost to play her somewhere. She's not like a mini-Agatha where you have no choice for the turn.\n\nThose two locations don't appear every game, and letting her decide to jump to those locations would be dumb.",
            "well, lucky me, i got x-23 first key. wont touch makkari lol",
            "Was missing two of the cards (Makkari and Gladiator) pulled once and got Gladiator...would kind of like Makkari but she doesn't seem that exciting so I think I'll save my keys.",
            "I know this community really sucks at evaluating cards but I agree that Makkari seems bad\n\nC4 is a meme deck and surfer has loads of better cards you'd rather run \n\nThe devs kinda messed up by \"buffing\" her to 3/4, she would've been amazing in C3",
            "Im a new player lacking x-23 for destroy and destroy/junk, both of which she is mvp or close to it. So ill be pulling this and hoping I avoid Maakari, but if i pull her and get x-23 last its not the end of the world.",
            "Passed on 3k gladiator in my shop thinking I would spend keys this week (already own x23). Now I'm reconsidering and just waiting.\n\n\nCurrently have Jean grey pinned",
            "I've decided to spend 1 key maximum on weeks like this.  I ended up getting Makkari and I look forward to seeing if anything neat ends up working out with her.  I feel like she may have a niche in a greedy deck.",
            "Anyone feel she\u2019d be really good in a Surfer deck? There\u2019s so many 3 costs you want to play that she\u2019s a good addition for an easy 4-6 power boost. Might be helpful with Jean/Negasonic plays too.",
            "So far I've pulled Gladiator and X-23. Based on what I'm reading, that seems like a good place to stop.",
            "I feel like the absolute last thing surfer decks need are random fodder that can crowd up a Wong. Easiest skip ever",
            "don't even need to play it or see it in action to say that it's clearly a 3k token card, SD needs to get it together and stop releasing everything as 6k",
            "I'm going to be cope using her and Gilgamesh in a Thena deck, I love the Eternals comics and Makkari + Thena/Gilgamesh relationship are my favorite. Will it be meta? No. Will it be cool to see them all together? Absolutely.",
            "We could've had Phastos or Arishem a week earlier, but no.",
            "I only care for x-23",
            "Absolute shite.",
            "This could easily have had the Proxima 'goes to lowest power location'. I don't believe it would significantly improve her, but might make her more consistent and let her access things like sanctum sanctorum.",
            "She will be very good for getting early priority for T2-T4. But are there any decks where having early turn priority is really important, and which can also spare a deck slot for her?",
            "So I used a modified version of[ Bynx's deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqEklkn0poc) (at 1:55:00) for Thena, replacing White Widow for Makkari (I don't have Widow). It's been doing pretty good so far! Her animation on hand and when she jumps is top-notch. So far is seems creators have been enjoying her. From Jeff's Legion/Storm lockdown to Dera's Zoo, it's fun to see.",
            "cl 1900 tried to pull for x23 and glad, but drew baron zemo duplicate as my random (feels sick) and I can be sure to pull makkari but trying to decide if it's a waste of another card",
            "I just wanted the Gladiator variant and luckily got it on my first pull.",
            "Dead on Arrival, should have been series 4.....",
            "Shes going to be a good card and you are going to see players and streamers have positive things to say about this card. But the issue is that she's terrible value for the ridiculous cost of a series 5 card. This is 100% a skip week for me. \n\nPersonally I think this card would be a lot more interesting if it had the text \"costs 0 on the turn you draw this.\" that way you get some eternal synergy with Thena and you also get to choose the location. Right now she just seems insanely underwhelming for a series 5.\n\nWhat happened to flexible series drops, because this is a perfect contender for a series 4 drop (honestly should be series 3).\n\nIf you couldn't tell I'm upset about all card releasing in series 5.",
            "Poo poo pee pee card",
            "Might pass",
            "I had 6 keys so I decided to pull the trigger 4 times because all 3 looked solid. Going to try to make room for her or gladiator in my surfer deck!",
            "i use her in my hazmat surfer deck, which i sometimes struggle to get more than 2 or 3 3-cost cards into the board, and I like that she is on the board no matter what, but i will say that she seems to pick the worst place to play herself every single time lol",
            "This card feels like USAgent week 2.0. In the sense that SD will buff it during the first OTA/patch after her release.\n\nOverall I see far more negatives than positives.\n\nFirst downside of the card: zero control where she is going.\n\nSecond downside: unfun card, you literally have to NOT play it to use it.\n\nThird downside: she is NOT FREE, she costs you a card draw. The average draw x game is 9 cards. So are paying a 1/9 of your \"draw resources\". How many ppl would be happy with a location that says: \"Skip your next card draw. Add +4 Power to your side at a random location once\". \n\nFourth downside: her best deck atm feels that is SS but that deck cards slot is already VERY competitive. So you dont even feel good finding her a place in there.",
            "I think an interesting buff would be \u201cAfter Turn 3, runs from your hand or deck to a random location. (if possible)",

            "she cool in dazzler zoo decks",
            "All I wanted was Hellfire X-23 and I got it \ud83d\ude0e plus Skaar from my first pull, which I hadn't really given much thought to but I'm having fun with it in my Sauron deck",
            "Is it worth trying for if I don't have gladiator or x-23? I have 12 keys saved, but I'm just CL 2k so I'm missing a bunch of cards. Saving for upcoming weeks but as I understand it they are both really good cards?",
            "Not the worst card but certainly skippable\u00a0",
            "Saved up 6 keys, 2 to try and get Gladiator this week, 4 for all cards next week and 6k tokens for Arishem. Pulled Makkari first key, duplicate second key.\n\nDidn't particularly want Makkari but she's working as good as any other card in a Surfer Deck, tbf she did actually win me a game by running to a tied location",
            "I can see one of the following happening with this card:  \n\n1. She's a lot better in practice than on paper. She has a use and people are going to be wishing they got her.\n\nor\n\n2. She really is as bad as people think and she gets a power buff / text change pretty soon that makes her better and everyone is going to wish they got her. I can see something like \"After the turn, runs to your location with the least power\"\n\n  \nRelated rant incoming but....  \n\nIt drives me crazy how people are always so confident or pessimistic about a new card almost immediately. Most of the time, people making these comments haven't even played with the card. It doesn't take much effort to find a bunch of examples of people on this sub being dead wrong about cards on release or SD changing cards to make them relevant. The meta is constantly shifting in SNAP.\n\nCannonball and USAgent are two pretty recent examples of people on here shitting on a card only for SD to change something about it or have the meta shift and all of a sudden everyone wishes they got the card. Majority of people on here were also praising Namora saying \"She's insane. Crazy strong and a must get\" and now nobody ever plays her because she needs so many things to go right to make her worth it. \n\nAm i saying Makkari for sure gets a buff or is better than she seems? Absolutely not. But maybe people on here need to start learning to let some time pass and let things unfold before being so confident in how they view cards and trying to sway peoples opinions on getting cards because \"trust me bro, card is amazing/trash\".",
            "I'm glad they released sersi and makkari, more keys saved, thank you SD",
            "If they actually stuck to their flexible series releases this would be a prime candidate for going straight into Series 4 imo.\n\nEZ save for the week personally.",
            "This card just needs an adjustment to have it go to a specific location rather than random, then it'd be \"Ok\" and a sometimes inclusion.  Being random, if Sersi has taught me anything, will burn you here and there so competitively this card is not it.\n\nEasy pass, have the other cards, waiting for Arishem.",
            "She\u2019s stronger than I expected. Don\u2019t play her in Surfer, she wants to be in decks that care about early priority. Sorry to tell you, but Storm-Legion might be back.",
            "one of my first games with her, she jumped to sanctum sanctorum and won me the game\u2026every other time she seems to end up in my wong lane which is quite obnoxious sometimes when i want to fill my wong lane",
            "I'm actually enjoying her in my control Asgardians deck as it doesn't interfere with the curve and with the lack of a 1 cost card in the deck it's nice having her come out if you draw her initially.  Her raw power may not be the greatest but she's basically 0 cost plus whatever card you are wanting to play on top so I believe she is better than what most are giving her credit for.",
            "I decided to pull for X-23 even though I think Makkari will be bad. First pull Black Knight, second pull X-23. Now I'm debating whether I want Gladiator badly enough to risk wasting a key adding Makkari to my collection...",
            "More often than not she's four points in one of the first turns, making prio swing in your favor. She's also helpful in that you can play more tech/disruptive cards without having to worry about swinging points like Red Guardian, Luke Cage or NTW",
            "Ok, so I'm a Cerebro fanboy, and she slots in quite nicely.

Efficiently budgeting keys means sometimes you have to make that choice a month in advance. Scarcity of keys also means people are looking for reasons to pass on cards. \n\nYou're not wrong, but the behavior isn't really as much a personal failing as much as it is a pretty organic response to the spotlight system as it is now.

            "She'd be the best card in the game.\n\nLiterally everyone except the strictest A-B combo decks would run her.",
            ">Even then you're probably going to want to fill that lane with another 3 cost anyway since there's only one spot in it\n\nProbably, but any good Surfer list will have tech cards in it. If I need to Rogue or Red Guardian in that specific lane, Makkari can mess things up. Plus, Surfer generally has no problem hand-dumping on Turn 6 with Sera anyway so filling up lanes (whether post Sera or after Brood + Absorbing Man) isn't an issue. \n\nThe perk of Surfer is buffing 3 drops with great effects; raw bodies for stats were never the issue. I don't think she's terrible if someone is missing other key 3 drops or simply don't want to bother with tech cards, but I don't believe she'll be part of the \"meta\" version of Surfer. That being said, I like playing the Sersi version so who am I to talk lol",
            "Yup, it's a decent card. People are so used to meta breaking cards that whenever something normal arrives it's instantly tagged as shitty and useless. Cards like this allow fun and new plays and I'm all in for that.",
            "Fair I don\u2019t notice that",
            "Looks good. I'll give it a try :)",
            "You run HE just for cyclops?",
            "in the person's upgrade she legit thins your deck. the only time she doesnt manage to is turn 6. she cantrips for absolutely free with, shes a deck thinner",
            "Read what the person he's responding to wrote",
            "she legit would thin the deck what are you on? if she plays herself for free and draws a card, she thins the deck.",
            "She needs a text adjustment",
            "Going from your hand to the board isnt moving.",
            "You buying?",
            "You don't have to own every card and for sure you don't need to spend 6K cards in this card lol.",
            "a 0/6 really?",
            "Hercules released as series 5 and was dropped this June",
            "Nah. That\u2019s stupid. If card will be really that bad, it will 100% get buffed. And in any way it\u2019s a new card, not 1k tokens. Hard to complain about this",
            "I could never get the old sera surfer deck to work. Tbh I can't get the tech surfershaw deck to work with or without sera right now. Just not the right meta for it or I'm playing it poorly",
            "Still, if you're running Surfer you're probably running Brood. That 1/3 chance she fills that lane - either unnecessary because you're pretty sure on winning it or you can't drop something else there for protection - instead of going somewhere you'd actually want to add power, seems a downside.",
            "Yeah, unless it has a really good animation and yells some sort of surprise bitch makari is here like red hulk power ups.",
            "Can confirm it does not lol I play a ton of surfer.",
            "Ah yeah,i just got surfer for this months series 3 picks. Ive only ran one deck with him and has magik. Usually all the spots get filled on turn 7",
            "Yeah players are ofc gonna keep theory crafting around the card but I dont think my opinion will change unless ofc proven otherwise. Card is the easiest skip of the month",
            "Yeah it's not ideal but aside from that and Surfer, I don't see any use right now and the RNG has the potential to ruin Surfer.\n\nI'm gonna be saving my keys on this one lol.",
            "Wow, that fucking sucks",
            "Fuck me",
            "I think 2/3 makes sense.",
            "I'm CL12.5k but am missing a whole bunch of S5 cards, I can't remember the last time I spent a key and didn't get a duplicate. They need to adjust the Duplicate vs New Card rate for that slot, if not get rid of the duplicate mechanic altogether.",
            "Yeah I think so! Seems like a good, solid deck type. \n\nAlright, sounds like a plan! I'll start to save up for Knull immediately, and see if I can pull X-23 and then maybe Death. Thanks for the advice!",
            "I have thought about making a destroy deck, and saving up for Knull. Another archetype I play regularly is Surfer, so Gladiator seems like a strong addition to that deck. Mill also looks kinda fun, even though it's not exactly meta. \n\nThat's true, Makkari might be buffed or fit in somewhere else down the road!",
            "Yeah, she is clearly good in junk decks but I'm not feeling comfortable at all by winning a location with rng, if I screw up I want to screw up by myself, simple as that, that's why I said that \"in my opinion\" she is better than makkari, but not fantastic. She is clearly good but don't like the randomness that comes with her",
            "Or just as a backup for when you draw Sentry and not Anni.",
            "Well, I pulled Gladiator with key #3. Never thought I'd be so happy about not hitting the featured card until key #4. \n\nI'm gonna wait out the week and see if anyone actually does something interesting with Makkari. If so, I'll grab her. But with several upcoming weeks with good and important cards that I need to pull for (Corvus/Phastos, Galactus/Nebula, and possibly Darkhawk/Bill/Ajax), I think I need to save every key I can.\n\nThank you for the advice, though. I definitely see where you're coming from and if I were a bit higher up on the CL ladder with more s4 cards in my collection (and therefore a higher chance of 1K tokens with the mystery slot), I think you're absolutely right that it's correct to grab the guaranteed new card.",
            "Yeah but there is a consolation prize of her leaving space in your hand for copying other cards.",
            "Yeah that'd be op. So maybe something like \"at end of game runs to random location\" would be better. Still meaningful with RNG in there for chance of uselessness but without the downside of a clog. Bring her back down to 3/3.\u00a0",
            "I still remember Legion gave 500 tokens. He was effectively a 2500 card.",
            "Best advice I can give is to really stack two lanes with your 4-power cards if you can. Don't set out to win all three. This deck isn't really built for that because Cerebro and Mystique aren't going to provide any lane power, and Luke Cage and Magik won't help you much, either. Use Klaw to support the lane you only have three 4-drops in, so each lane can get the 32 power.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with playing High Evo, either! Unlike a traditional High Evo deck, he is actively helping you in this deck.",
            "And HE is a 4-power, as well. Choices are very limited for 4-power cards, but it has worked fairly well so far.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Mb I thought you meant as she is now",
            "As you see 0-4 is worse than literaly a wasp right now, since you can control the wasp, but not makari",
            "What\u2019s your deck look like? Some of the newer cards like red guardian,nocturne,hope summers have really helped surfer a lot imo.\n\nGladiator is probably a must too",
            "Could be\u2026we might find out but seeing as I\u2019m a bit interested in the card I know I\u2019m not getting it \ud83e\udd23. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have much of an issue holding off on brood until late and opening hand-turn 2 makari draw you can plan around it. Could be interesting I genuinely can\u2019t really tell how it\u2019s gonna go lol. I just feel less \u2018locked in\u2019 to playing cards in certain lanes with surfer than people are describing overall. Nocturne has def helped smooth things out",
            "Tbf I can see this card being changed it did have a home in cerebro prior to its \"buff\" maybe in another change we can see a 4/5 Makkari who works best in C5",
            "I\u2019m surprised how many people are talkin about Wong/magik surfer here so maybe I\u2019m in the minority lol. But i have never found the Wong-ified surfer decks to be nearly as good.  It\u2019s so much fun when it works but it doesn\u2019t feel very consistent with how easy to counter Wong is.  Canceling out limbo is pretty easy now as well",
            "Actually I'd go further in the power direction, 3/5. Her cost doesn't really matter bc you never play her. Still out of cerebro but better for surfer",
            "Yes either way, feels really good in that package.",
            "With those spotlights coming up, as long as you have keys to guarantee new cards vs. Variants / tokens you are gtg. That week with 3 new cards is great with DH, BRB, and Ajax. \n\nThat is a week I plan to use keys for Ajax and BRB.\n\nI mostly hold keys for weeks with two new cards. I'm CL 10k+ and am missing 11 cards... And I don't care about most of them. I have 4 keys and 6k+ tokens atm. Passing on Makkari since next week is Phastos and Corvus.",
            "Lots of decks can fill up lanes to control where a \"random\"action occurs, which eliminates the RNG penalty. \n\nI think you'd just need to knock the power down. She'd be an M'Baku from your hand.",
            "And he\u2019s an amazing card",
            "the actual card is not a deck thinner. the upgrade that this guy wants absolutely is a deck thinner.",
            "understandable, I woulda definitely been miserably wrong if I was talking about her as is",
            "makkari is way better than wasp, people are js saying she\u2019s not worthy of series 5",
            "I don't have nocturne. \n\nAt the moment I'm playing\n\nShaw\n\nBrood\n\nHope\n\nRed guardian\n\nRogue\n\nJuggernaut\n\nNtw\n\nSurfer\n\nAbsorbing man\n\nOkoye\n\nChavez\n\nForge\n\n\n\nI've had wong, iron heart, cosmo and shang chi in at various points. \n\nI don't have gladiator\n\nN\nHonestly it's excellent at conquest. But not amazing at normal ladder.\n\nIdk what the difference is. Maybe I'm better at playing rogue and rg when I know what someone has",
            "Definitely looks like an interesting card but as I said before, it looks like it will be something between a fun card or a good card but not really archetype defining. It's possible I'm completely wrong here and it happens to be busted. However, as of now, I find it hard to justify gambling keys if you don't want anything else from the spotlight or coughing up the 6k tokens.",
            "Yeah, the fact that changing cards is always on the table and new play styles like sersi come out all the time sometimes makes a whatever card become really good like the cannonball professor x nonsense.",
            "Also, 3-6 I guess is a stretch youre right.. 3-5 should be reasonable i think, shed be good, but still not broken, even tho c5 exists.. Hm idk, i just know she sucks rn",
            "Brother, shes not worth replacing any of my cards in surfer decks, and she single handedly might loose you games, by going in location such as, throne, lukes bar, etc\nSo how is she better then wasp, when wasp is played by a couple of decks, but makari, in two days, literaly wont be played anymore, and you know it",
            "Yea I\u2019m in the probably very tiny subset of people that maybe should risk a key on it haha I think the vast majority should skip it"
