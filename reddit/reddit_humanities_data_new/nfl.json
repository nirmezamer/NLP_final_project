Stats for each player are included below. Additionally, their ranks from previous years are available for y\u2019all to see\n\n#METHODOLOGY\n\n*[Link to more detailed writeup on our methodology](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1d51ba1/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_hub_post/)*  \n  \n* **Step 1:** A [Call to Rankers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1ae1xu9/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_call_for/) right after the Conference Championship games \n  \n* **Step 2:** Rankers from each team nominated players to rank, with a **11 game minimum threshold.** Players are associated with the team they played for in 2023\n\n* **Step 3:** The Grind. We instructed users to tier positions groups into T25, T50, etc based on **2023 regular season play only.** This took several weeks as the rankers tiered each position group and discussed them. There were no individual player threads and no arbitrary position caps. Just questions and rankings.\n \n* **Step 4:** Users submitted their own personal **Top 125 lists**. \n   \n* **Step 5:** User lists were reviewed by myself, u/MikeTysonChicken and u/mattkud.

Tight end, Iowa. Sam LaPorta quickly proved what a reliable target he would be for Goff. The [first two highlights here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Va8hgT-F8) in week 2 against Seattle was a preview of the kind of player LaPorta would be. He is tough, great at making tight, contested catches, and he has fantastic field awareness especially for a rookie where he is going to fight for a first down.\nLaPorta has an exceptional ability to say to the first defender to make contact with him \"I do not wish to be tackled yet, thank you though.\" [Here's just another fun play to watch that showcases Laporta's abilities](https://youtu.be/a_Va8hgT-F8?si=YF5cuHfk-Dx5M9iI&t=546) And LaPorta didn't just have a great rookie season that showed that he has a lot of promise. He had a historic rookie season. With 86 receptions, he broke the rookie tight end reception record. He also joins the company of tight ends Gronk and Ditka to be only the third tight end to score 10+ touchdowns in their rookie year. LaPorta and Gronk both with 10, and Ditka holding the record with 12. LaPorta is a player I'm sure Lions fans are excited to watch for years to come.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#59 - Brock Purdy - San Francisco 49ers - Quarterback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/MC_Stimulation\n\nWhat a story Brock Purdy is. His 2022 run felt like a movie, he came on the scene and completely took over the NFL headlines, winning and winning, playing good football, and proving that evaluating QB\u2019s in the draft is much more of a crapshoot than people care to admit. Then tragedy struck. Haason Reddick hit Purdy\u2019s arm in the 2022 NFC Championship game and Purdy was left unable to throw with a torn UCL in his right elbow. A devastating loss and end to the season left 49ers fans unsure of what was to come in 2023, would Trey Lance once again take the reins? The 49ers bringing in Sam Darnold also muddied the situation. There were even rumors of the 49ers reaching out to Tom Brady to have one last ride! What was the plan? But, as usual, the 49ers FO were tight lipped, ignored the media, and knew what they were gonna do. They were all in on Brock Purdy.\n\nThey made the right choice.\n\nBrock Purdy was statistically the most impressive QB of the 2023 season, leading the league in Passer Rating, Yards per Attempt, Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt, Yards per Completion, TD%, as well as being top 5 or better in Passing Yards (5th), Passing TD\u2019s (3rd), and Completion Percentage (2nd amongst starters of 10+ games played). He absolutely lit up the league this year and, if not for a very unfortunate game against Baltimore, likely would have received serious MVP considerations.\n\nBrock had many plays that former Niners QBs just couldn\u2019t make. His shifty [run](https://youtube.com/shorts/OC3VYCrftr8?si=clqr3FEjj_ymG2vA) against the Steelers in Week 1 would have been a run of no gain or throw away in the Jimmy G era. His [TD](https://youtu.be/gLqWKs9esYw?si=JCfmLzJaOwqHb4qG) against Seattle likely would have been a checkdown or a sack in the old era. Plays like [this](https://youtu.be/NhV3wBfIRe0?si=wv33VXBGWGzHwxx3) also shows that Purdy maneuvers in the pocket like a Vet and finds the open man.\n\nIs Brock a system QB? Is he only good because of Shanahan and the squad around him? There will always be doubts and criticism surrounding him because of his size, his draft spot, and the team around him. But at the end of the day, Brock Purdy has shown that he can drive the bus for the 49ers, and people might just have to get used to him playing QB for 49ers for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#58 - Danielle Hunter - Minnesota Vikings - EDGE Rusher**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|2016|2015|\n--:|:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|81|N/A|N/A|20|32|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/Nijo32\n\nDanielle Hunter entered the 2023 season facing numerous questions. Would he hold out for a new contract? How would he fit into Brian Flores\u2019 aggressive scheme? Was his play regressing after debilitating injuries in 2020 and 2021? Hunter answered each of these questions in resounding fashion, putting forth a milestone season filled with career bests.\n\nHunter reported to Vikings camp at the end of July, inking a one-year deal upped his guaranteed money and nixed the possibility of a franchise tag in the offseason. The outlook was clear: this was a contract year for Hunter, and he\u2019d need to deliver to earn the bigger payday he was seeking.\n\nComplicating matters in Hunter\u2019s contract season was a dramatic scheme change. Gone was the Ed Donatell scheme that sat in zone and relied on winning individual match-ups to create pressure out of 4-man rushes. Gone too were Hunter\u2019s premier rushing mates, Za\u2019Darius Smith and Dalvin Tomlinson. Instead, Hunter would now be creatively deployed in Brian Flores\u2019 ultra-aggressive, maniacally-blitzing defense, , in an attempt to overhaul 2022\u2019s 31^(st) ranked defense.\n\nHunter took to the new scheme immediately. Rather than predictably rushing Hunter from the same wide alignment (98.5% of rushes in 2022), Flores innovated; Hunter played nearly 150 snaps from a 4i / 5 / Box pre-snap position in 2023, all while his teammates unpredictably blitzed or dropped around him. He also flipped sides more than ever in his career, with a 71.2% / 28.8% split in 2023. The result was an uptick in true one-on-one matchups he could feast on, and feast he did. Hunter posted career bests in sacks (16.5, 5^(th) in NFL), TFLs (23, T-1^(st)), and tackles (83, 2^(nd) amongst edges). Hunter\u2019s volume snaps popped in part due to the iron man season he put forth, quelling any fears that injuries had left his best days behind him. His 1,004 snaps played were second only to Maxx Crosby, and his production was equally impressive as both a pass rusher and run defender. In addition to the TFLs, his 50 stops (defined as a tackle constituting a failure by the offense) ranked 3^(rd) amongst edge rushers. And while volume stats are impressive, Hunter\u2019s efficiency holds up impressively in spite of playing nearly twice as many snaps as some of his peers. His PFF pass-rush-productivity score ranks 20^(th) amongst edges, while his run stop rate ranks 14^(th). He also finished 6^(th) and 11^(th) on Brandon Thorn\u2019s True Sack and True Pressure rankings, respectively, which grade every single sack and pressure for quality (i.e. beating an elite tackle is worth more than being a free rusher on a broken play). So while Flores\u2019 scheme certainly helped unlock Hunter\u2019s monster season, it was far from empty calories.\n\nAs a Vikings fan and former defensive end, there is so much about Hunter\u2019s game to appreciate. He\u2019s a physical specimen who may as well have been built in a lab, with the most impressive [arms](https://static.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/12153111/Danielle-Hunter-Landing-Spots-scaled.jpg) I\u2019ve maybe ever seen. He pairs his incredible gifts with impeccable technique \u2013 rather than overwhelming with physical traits, his rushes are often a slow burn, controlling an OT with hand placement and relentlessly bearing down on the QB, as evidenced by his [first sack of \u201923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-2dTMRJ820&ab_channel=NFL). In his own words, he\u2019s come a long way from Zimmer telling him to \u201cuse his hands or he\u2019d chop them off.\u201d That said, do not doubt Hunter\u2019s ability to ghost an OT; he\u2019s not afraid to [jump](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-gets-vikings-second-sack-for-the-opening-drive), [juke](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-takes-down-purdy-for-a-sack), or [spin](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-gets-11th-sack-of-season) his way into a sack. And as mentioned, Hunter is a do-it-all DE, so here is him [eviscerating a Lions 3^(rd) and 1](https://www.nfl.com/videos/danielle-hunter-absolutely-engulfs-jahmyr-gibbs-for-3-yard-tfl) as well as him [sniffing out a Falcons screen](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-and-hicks-engulf-allgeier).\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I appreciate you, but not nearly as much as I appreciate and will miss Danielle Hunter. His 2023 season was truly special, and he\u2019s one of the more complete edge rushers I\u2019ve had the pleasure of watching.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\n#**#57 - Trent McDuffie - Kansas City Chiefs - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/confederalis\n\nAfter a solid rookie season, Trent McDuffie exploded onto the scene in 2023, establishing himself as one of, if not the, best nickelback in the league. Combining an innate knowledge of the field and how to play in a zone with robust tackling and a nose for the football, McDuffie put together a season well deserving of First Team All-Pro. And as much as it hurts me to say, he silenced any further doubt towards this position after his stellar, Super Bowl MVP-worthy performance in the season\u2019s biggest game. McDuffie is *clearly* deserving of the #57 spot on the /r/NFL Top100 List.\n\nTrent McDuffie\u2019s greatest skill, from his time at Washington all the way through to his starting role in Kansas City, has been his ability to cover in zone coverage as well as anyone in the league. He possesses incredible play recognition, closing speed, block shedding, and tackling, allowing him to roam the flats and underneaths of the field, helping to shut down the short game and prevent long plays. [Here against the Vikings](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1711871190170792177), McDuffie recognizes the check down before Kirk even begins his motion, sprinting downfield, and making the strong tackle on a running back with tons of free space in front of him. [Similarly, against the Chargers](https://x.com/RealMNchiefsfan/status/1716973736929423735), McDuffie recognizes the play and breaks from his deep zone early, again sprinting hard to the ball, and making a great shoestring tackle in open space. McDuffie was also a ballhawk, leading all corners in forced fumbles, and was second in the league overall, with 5. This includes a strong tackle and forced fumble on [the one and only Tyreek Hill](https://x.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1724600423091515535). A great example of McDuffie combining all of his many talents is [this play against the Bills](https://x.com/Jacobs71/status/1706786735751893465), where McDuffie quickly recognizes the run, sheds his block, and punches the ball out from the back.\n\nHowever, McDuffie\u2019s game didn\u2019t just emanate from his superb run-stopping and zone coverage. He was excellent on blitzes and rushing the passer, leading all corners in pressures, sacks, QB hits, and batted passes. He could also shine in man coverage, lining up across from some of the best receivers in the league in the slot, like [Justin Jefferson](https://x.com/LedyardNFLDraft/status/1711613356849713152) and [Deebo Samuel](https://x.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1798363176024903900). For a great example of his skills in this department, look no further than [this rep against the Jaguars](https://x.com/InHarmsWay19/status/1703856469664227493). McDuffie, matched up one-on-one with no help, trails Zay Jones perfectly, all the way through the end zone, taking away a passing lane and pushing Jones out of bounds as the ball reaches them.\n\nTrent McDuffie excels in much of what makes a good slot corner; run-stopping, zone coverage, play recognition, and tackling, and he can more than hold his own lined up in man. Couple this with McDuffie\u2019s propensity to force out the ball and his natural pass-rushing ability and you have a player who can act as a Swiss army knife for one of the best defensive coordinators in the league. McDuffie played all over the field in 2023, and I expect him to become an even more crucial part of this vaunted defense with the departure of L\u2019Jarius Sneed. Only just coming off his sophomore season, there are only better things to come for Trent McDuffie.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#56 - Chris Lindstrom - Atlanta Falcons - Offensive Guard**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|\n--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|36|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/packmanwiscy\n\nFor the 2nd straight season, Chris Lindstrom demonstrated his ability to be one of the best guards in the NFL. In his time in Atlanta, the guard has had a bevy of quarterbacks to protect and running back to block for, but regardless of whose behind him Lindstrom has graded to be PFF\u2019s best guard in the league. In 2022 PFF graded Lindstrom with one of the best run-blocking seasons in the last decade and Atlanta pounded the rock at the fourth highest rate in the NFL this year, and Chris maintained his excellent blocking throughout. The Falcons don\u2019t have a great passing attack but Lindstrom does his part, allowing less than 1 pressure per game. If you don\u2019t trust these pff stats, just watch [Brian Baldinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDseRdlxGMY) break down his excellent play. \n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#55 - Creed Humphrey - Kansas City Chiefs - Center**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|\n--:|--:|\n|31|31\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/RomosexuaII\n\n**Intro** \n\nThere is one phrase that sums up the Kansas City Chiefs' 2023 season. \"Our down year is better than most teams' best.\" This sentiment also applies to Creed Humphrey's performance in 2023. Not as good as his first few seasons where he distinguished himself as one of the best interior o-linemen in the NFL, but was still a stabilizing force as the KC offense figured out their issues. Elite run blocker, well above average pass blocker. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Stats are generally for nerds but here are a few:**\n\n- Humphrey played 1902 snaps\n\n- He only allowed 16 pressures and 4 sacks \n\n- Accounted for 6 penalties\n\n- Had a 78.2 PFF overall rating. \n\n\n**Accolades, future, legacy** \n\nThis big beefy boy has been to two Pro Bowls and was a 2nd Team All-Pro in 2022. With Jason Kelce retired, there's no reason he can't be the consensus best at his position in 2024. He ~~will~~ could also be the first starting center to be part of a 3-peat. Will go down in history for the [greatest neckbeard](https://imgur.com/qbiy3U00) of all time.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#54 - Joe Thuney - Kansas City Chiefs - Offensive Guard**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|2016|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|54|72|79|59|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/broccolibush42\n\nJoe Thuney is aging like fine wine. One of the most consistent guards in the league in the past decade, he has proved to be a cornerstone for the Chiefs Offensive Line ever since they gave him that 5 year deal worth 80 million dollars. In 2023, Joe Thuney won his 4th ring, and 2nd with the Chiefs, as he and the Chiefs proved to the league why they are the best team in football. Thuney uses incredible footwork to slow some of the toughest DT's in the league down. Watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv2v9s1cVx0) as he and Creed Humphrey work Quinnen Williams all game despite the rest of the Offensive Line falling apart around him You can see how he wins his matchups and excellently positions his body to create the holes his RB needs, He skillfully keeps Quinnen in place on passing downs. You can clearly see his value in this game as his compatriots on the line, outside of Creed, are just not good. I digress. Joe is 31 years old, he still has plenty of gas left in that tank, and will prove immensely valuable as the Chiefs seek to be the first team ever to three-peat the Super Bowl.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#53 - Charvarius Ward - San Francisco 49ers - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|\n--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|83|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/MC_Stimulation\n\nCharvarius \u201cMooney\u201d Ward followed up a solid 2022 season by ascending into the upper tier of corners in the NFL. Ward had always been a decent corner, he won a Superbowl when he was in Kansas City; but coming over to San Francisco Ward had expectations to take over and be a shutdown corner. Ward had a solid 2022 season, but his 2023 performance gave Ward his first Pro Bowl nod and was honored by being named 2nd Team All Pro for his efforts. Ward looked to lock down every team's WR1 and help the 49ers secondary change from a question mark to an exclamation point. \n\nWard was key in defending the top receivers in the NFC West, including a fantastic game against Seattle, locking up [DK Metcalf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2Udwuv9fE) on Thanksgiving. This was likely Ward\u2019s most impressive game of the season, allowing 4 catches on 11 targets, and frequently frustrating DK Metcalf (although that is not very difficult). \n\nWard\u2019s 2023 season saw him rack up 5 Interceptions, including a [pick-six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjuVxssJl0), a forced fumble, and 16 PBU\u2019s. He also had 61 tackles. Per PFF, Mooney had a coverage grade of 83.3, a run defense grade of 71.7 and allowed a 63 Passer Rating when targeted. \n\nWard looks to follow his impressive 2023 season with another one in 2024, and hope that he can help the 49ers to another Superbowl, hopefully with a better outcome for the 49ers this time.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#52 - DaRon Bland - Dallas Cowboys - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A|\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/lowkeyguerilla\n\nImagine your CB1 goes down for the season with a season ending injury in practice. What are you supposed to do? Typically, you wouldn\u2019t expect your second year, third string, former fifth round pick to be the guy that steps up in his place. The team would probably struggle and fail to compensate for the loss. Typically, a below average corner would be thrown into the role where he inevitably underperforms to the previous corner\u2019s expectations. But DaRon Bland is not typical. Bland shined when many thought he would fail. \n\nAccording to PFF DaRon Bland was the second highest overall graded corner on the year with a grade of 89.5. Similar to Trevon Diggs, many have called out Bland due to the yards given up. But when you have a top five defense in points allowed during the season, the fans shouldn\u2019t lose too much sleep over yards. DaRon Bland also broke a 52 year old record for single season pick sixes originally set by Ken Houston in 1971. \n\nNotable players bland had as many or more TDs than in 2023: Amari Cooper, Cooper Kupp, Terry Mclaurin, Michael Pittman, Jaylen Waddle, OBJ, Garrett Wilson, Chris Godwin\n\n___\n\n#**#51 - Trey Hendrickson - Cincinnati Bengals - EDGE Rusher**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|\n:--|--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|N/A|51|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n\n**Written by:** u/KingDing-a-Ling13\n\nIn 2021, when the Bengals signed Trey Hendrickson to a big contract, I remember I laughed at them. Carl Lawson was a Bengals free agent, and while his stats weren\u2019t eye-popping, his film was great. On the flip side, Hendrickson had great stats, but I thought they were inflated and that he would regress. After three seasons and three straight Pro Bowls, Trey Hendrickson has made me look like a cotton-headed ninny muggins. In 2023, Hendrickson had a career high in sacks with 17.5, tied for second most in the league last season, and he deserves this spot on the list, no questions asked.     \nIn order to get 17.5 sacks, you need to have an impressive and versatile bag of pass-rushing tricks. Hendrickson has made the most of his money on his signature swipe move. Hand technique is incredibly important in both pass-rushing and pass-blocking, and Hendrickson\u2019s swipe can be devastating. A subtle-looking move that can easily be missed if you\u2019re not looking for it, Hendrickson starts with what looks like a standard outside speed rush, but right as the offensive tackle tries to engage him, [Trey uses his lightning quick hands to swat away the blocker\u2019s reach](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1725974658208448692?s=19), throwing the tackle completely off his rhythm and allowing Trey to easily blow around the edge, killing the drive. [Here\u2019s another example with the same move](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1742316085955674489?s=19), where Hendrickson completely neutralizes the initial jab and speeds around the edge for a strip sack. It\u2019s an underappreciated part of the game, but those lightning quick hands give Hendrickson so many chances around the edge and can make him a nightmare for opposing tackles. He\u2019s no one-trick pony either. At 270 pounds, Trey is packing a lot of weight and strength for an edge rusher, and he can overwhelm blockers with it. A great example is [this bullrush](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1711769808755429597?s=19), where Trey simply explodes straight into the tackle, throwing the tackle off balance, and then finishes the rush with a rip move into the quarterback for an impressive sack. In arguably his best game of the season, a week 14 win against the Colts, Hendrickson put all of the above on display and absolutely abused the Colts left side, [repeatedly getting into the backfield](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1734573831321272674?s=19) for multiple sacks and pressures on the day. Brandon Thorn, a highly respected lineman-specializing analyst, [charted Hendrickson as having the tied-best \u201csack score\u201d of the season](https://trenchwarfare.substack.com/p/the-2023-true-sack-rate-tsr-week-544), a metric he created to judge a player\u2019s sack numbers based on the circumstances of the sack. Whether you\u2019re a box score watcher or a game film grinder, you can greatly appreciate the craft Hendrickson brings to the field.     \nI will use this final section of this writeup to soapbox for something I strongly believe in: half sacks are very stupid. I believe if two guys combined for a sack, they should both get a full sack attributed to their stats. Feel free to disagree with me, but my mind will not be changed! Anyways, why do I bring this up? If we convert every player\u2019s half sacks to full sacks, guess who leads the league in 2023? Trey Hendrickson. And TJ Watt is tied with him but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll probably be getting his own writeup at some point. For now, this is the time to appreciate a guy who rarely gets mentioned amongst the ranks of elite pass rushers in the league, despite league-leading sack numbers and analytical backing. Trey Hendrickson is an absolute beast, and he has proved me from three years ago very wrong.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\n#[Link to Positional Tracker Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MXJi-9xuV31yE2l-er5Drzi8VoPmpZB-TLTlZ7HByzs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#[Link to Ranker Reveal Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lvp4VgRJ5uQgSMvUfYoWmiY_VYqQp5Zj4qet_XTo9uQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#[Link to Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1d51ba1/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_hub_post/)\n\n#[Link to Previous Post (70-61)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1diwyp7/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_7061/)",

Russel Wilson had 26t tds/8 int 6.9 yard/attempt, Pat had 27td/14 int, 7 yards/attempt. Was Russ anywhere close to as good as Mahomes?

            "Tbh I think it's a _good_ thing that the graders are sticking to their own analysis over just factoring in box scores and external votes. This isn't supposed to be an aggregated ranking of other external stats and rankings, this is the r/NFL graders giving their own eye test analysis and aggregating _those_ together. \n\nIf I wanted to know players ranked on box stats, I'd look that up. If I wanted to know players ranked on MVP votes, I'd look that up. Those already exist. It's way more interesting to see an averaged ranking of 32 (or however many) eye tests from people presumably taking this seriously, because that's giving us a new perspective that _didn't already exist_. Yeah I might disagree personally with some stuff, but understanding where and why I disagree or other people's opinions differ from mine is like... kinda the point. That's where the value of these lists comes from.\n\nSo yeah \"but but but his MVP votes\" isn't gonna work on me.",

Nearly identical resumes last year. Hell, what about Stafford? He was lower on this list and he was 8th in MVP voting!",

The issue with streaming services being the main source of new content is that nobody is on the same page anymore with these series it seems like.\n\nLike me personally, there is so much free content on YouTube that I don\u2019t have the attention span or interest to start most  of the TV series out on streaming services.",

Additionally, school-sponsored religious activity or messaging (in a public school, of course) is forbidden. Although school's accomodating for religions, like allowing a religious group to meet on the premises, is not forbidden. But the main issue with the Establishment Clause is neutrality. The government can't show favoritism to any one religion, and on its face, that's what this statute appears to be doing\n\nThe argument that I've seen Louisiana make right now is that the Ten Commandments is a historical document, not a religious document, but I find that argument unpersuasive, so if this really wants to survive the Establishment Clause, then more needs to be done to make it neutral or the mandate for the Ten Commandments needs to be necessary to achieve a compelling interest (what compelling interest that may be, no idea)",

From a fan perspective, you'll get a better team with more potential to have big stars to watch because your QB isn't taking up all the cap space.\n\nOf course if a QB contract cap is instated, a WR cap probably isn't far behind because they're the next biggest expense.",

            "People are absolutely fucking braindead talking about this move.\n\nKirk is a 35 year old QB coming off an achilles tear. Plain and simple, there is 0 guarantees he comes back at the same level of play he was at before and there is 0 guarantee he stays healthy.\n\nIf the Falcons get the best out of Kirk, that is good and gives them a small chance to make a deep playoff run. If Kirk falls apart due to the achilles or age, they now have hedged their bets with a guy who is a great QB prospect. \n\nAnother argument I see about the Penix pick is that if youre going in with Cousins you should be getting Cousins talent around him so using the 1st on Penix over a guy like Turner is a mistake. Sure, half of that makes sense. You want to put talent around Kirk but also the odds of a rookie talent especially defensively coming in and immediately becoming a Super Bowl impact player is slim regardless and Kirks contract is only set up to be 2 years. Are the odds of that rookie making that big of an impact that early that high compared to looking 3 or 4 years down the line with Penix? Eh not by much.\n\nSimply put Kirk is a 2 year dice roll, if he isnt it, they will turn to Penix and you guys are always hyping up the sit and develop route, this is not much different than the others.",

But yeah, Penix to me feels like one of the most pro ready QBs in the draft aside from Caleb so just so odd.  But hey if they really feel like he's a franchise QB, even if he doesn't start until he's 26 that's still potentially a decade of QB play after Kirk I suppose.",

The move makes sense sorta, although it\u2019s a lot to take in considering the Kirk deal and the profile of Penix. If Penix was like much younger I don\u2019t think people would be as mad about this one.",

            "If he turns out to be a great QB, it doesn\u2019t matter. Cousins coming off an ACL tear at 36 got $200M.  Penix, if he\u2019s good, has at least a decade or more ahead of him. \n\nIs it the right pick?  Who knows. If they think he\u2019s *that* good though, then age and cousins don\u2019t matter.",
            "I agree, I think teams should always start their rookies straight out the gate",
            "NFL isn\u2019t college. It\u2019s way harder and way quicker and I feel like if you can get players up to speed in a controlled environment it\u2019s better than just throwing them in the deep end. \n\nIf Mahomes had entered the league and immediately been the starter he probably would have messed up and people would\u2019ve bashed on him. People were clowning on the packers for doing something similar with Love and he looks like a pretty good player now.",
            "Blank said they need a starting caliber qb right now. So they signed Kirk, who rightfully, was expensive. But Kirk is old, and coming off an injury. He\u2019s not gonna be the starter in 2-3 years. He\u2019s gonna be washed or retired. If he\u2019s not he\u2019s the exception. \n\nSo when the qb they had rated very highly fell to their pick at 8, they grabbed him. They knew trading back into the first to grab him was unlikely. The Falcons have \u201con paper\u201d a pretty star heavy offensive skill group. Another skill player would have been great, but not entirely necessary. They clearly didn\u2019t have any of the top defensive players very highly rated and neither did the top like 15 other teams. So they take Penix. Now they have a qb who just might be the starter by the end of next year, (Father Time and injuries are not kind and not very many qbs play til they are 38) and might be the starter in Atlanta for a really long time. His cheap contract allows them to get Penix ready with no hurry and have the potential of elite qb at the same time. \n\nSure they are saying they are loyal to Kirk but they aren\u2019t. Kirk has to be consistently good to keep his job here. They will start Kirk this year and probably next year, but if his play drops because of age or injury then don\u2019t be surprised to see Penix as the starter towards the end of next season. And then they can just cut Kirk. \n\nCousins isn\u2019t the answer, he\u2019s the stop gap. \n\nOf course there is also the chance Penix sucks, but that\u2019s just how the draft is. \n\nI don\u2019t hate the pick. I don\u2019t hate the Kirk signing. We will see how it turns out. But given the scarcity of quality qbs out there, and how expensive most of them are, and after watching Mariota and ridder this last year, I\u2019d rather have two qbs then none.",
            "It gets the people going",
            "I think their thought process is that they can minimize downside by getting two shots at QB, like Washington did with RG3 and Kirk. \n\nIf Kirk never recovers, maybe Penix is better. If Penix never pans out, Kirk is probably a solid floor at QB. \n\nOf course it's actually a recipe for mediocrity because if Penix is good you're paying way too much for a backup QB and if he's not you wasted an 8th overall pick.",
            "The Falcons must be TERRIFIED of Kirk getting injured again. That's the only way it makes sense to me.",
            "Because he's a really good prospect and you never know when you'll have a chance to draft someone of his caliber again. You could argue that they could have drafted a defensive end or something, but how likely would a rookie defensive end be the difference that takes a Cousins-led team to the Super Bowl?",
            "They wanted to avoid what\u2019s happened to us for the past two years(good all around team, terrible QB play, mired in mediocrity) when Kirk is gone, and they were extremely high on Penix.  Odunze or Dallas Turner or Latu or whoever doesn\u2019t suddenly turn us into a contender.  It\u2019s easy to argue with, but not hard to understand.",

So yeah, taking Penis Man was an easy decision.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth I\u2019m not hating on the player at all, I would just greatly prefer we went with one of the two and not both.",

            "From what I\u2019ve ready, they thought that he was too good a prospect to pass on and signed Kirk because they didn\u2019t expect him to be available. Whether or not that was a reasonable opinion to hold pre draft is a different question but that was the rationale",
            "From what it sounded like based off their interviews, they really wanted to have long term stability at QB (something Kirk doesn\u2019t provide), hence why they took him at 8. \n\nI\u2019m guessing the FO has been given a make or break year and decided to double down on finding a QB as QB play has been their excuse the last 3-4 years.",
            "They liked the player and think he\u2019ll be good. Complicated.",

Remember, he\u2019s coming back from a season-ending injury. We\u2019ve seen the importance of quality backup QBs. \n3. They really liked him.\n4. When they signed Kirk, they might not have finished their scouting process. This is a brand new coaching staff.",
            "They plan on winning a lot with Kirko and they won\u2019t have that high of a draft pick for a few years so why not get a quality guy and develop him so when the time comes to start him he\u2019s ready and you don\u2019t have to give up draft capital to move up in the draft?",

            "The only theory that made sense to me was that ATL knew they'd lose a high pick next year due to tampering and didn't like McCarthy, so they decided to bite the bullet and get their future QB. \n\nHowever that future QB is an old prospect, Kirk was given a huge deal for 4 years, and they only lost a 5th round pick due to tampering. So now I'm really confused",

            "I think people are overlooking the very real possibility that Kirk doesn\u2019t return to form.  He will be 36 years old and is coming back from a serious Achilles injury.  \n\nIt\u2019s not super common for QBs to play at a high level late into their 30s.  Guys like Brady and Rodgers have skewed the perception.  And an Achilles rupture is a significant injury - worse than a torn ACL.  \n\nFor all we know, Kirk could come back, play 2 games, and his leg gives out again.  At best if he stays healthy you can realistically expect 2 seasons of solid play.  That\u2019s IF everything plays out with his recovery. \n\nPenix was an excellent prospect and while it may seem like a silly pick on the surface, if you look at the full picture with Kirk\u2019s age and injury situation, I think it makes perfect sense",

Yes Cousins could get injured or fall off, but if he plays well then you\u2019re basically wasting the first few years of having Penix on your team.",
            "They probably signed him because they didn't know who would be available to them in the draft. Everyone knew the top 3 QBs were going #1-3. And there was a lot of talk of teams trading up. If they didn't sign Cousins they would either need to trade up or risk going into next season with no viable quarterback at all at the #8 spot.",
            "I'm not sure why people ever thought the Falcons were in \"Superbowl or bust\" mode when they signed Cousins. We have a new head coach, a mediocre at best defense with no pass rush, and a good run blocking but spotty pass blocking OL. Our only real strength is at the skill positions, and that's if you believe Pitts still has potential.\n\nI think the reason they signed Kirk was just that there weren't any better options. None of the other free agents QBs besides Baker were even low-tier starters. And if they didn't like any of the non-top-3 QBs in the draft other than Penix they'd be fucked if he got sniped by another team. \n\nThe Falcons have just been too bad for too long. The fans (and ownership, and our GM) needed some semblance of winning football now, even if it wasn't SB winning football. I'm not sure that was worth the money, but being cheap about QBs is what got us here in the first place.",

Maybe on the expensive side but if either of these guys work out in the next few years, no one in Atlanta is going to regret the choice",

And Penix is far from the perfect QB prospect to go with this plan, but the Falcons probably decided to go with this plan before the draft and Penix is just the best QB they could get going forward.

            "Well going into the age topic a bit more, I think the issue people have is its normal for QBs to hit there stride around 28-30, but a lot of that reason is because by that age they have 5-8 years of NFL starting experience. Its possible for Penix to hit that age with 0 full years with starting experience. I dont think thats likely considering Kirks age, but if that were to happen, Penix would need another \\~4 years as a starter to hit his stride, which is getting into 32+ age range, which is more then awkward.\n\nLooking at it from the Falcons point of view, the best explanation I can give for their pick is they didnt want to fully commit to Kirk or a rookie. They got Kirk for a CHANCE to win a superbowl, but they still want a backup plan for if Kirk doesnt work out due to either his injury or age slowing him down to much. They want to hedge their bet on both options (Kirk vs developing a rookie) so they dont end up in a situation they have no out on. Its not the worst plan, all be it a bit conservatives. I think the main issue is Penix is far from the best prospect to make this plan with, but the Falcons already decided on their plan before the draft and Penix just happened to be the best QB available to move forward so they went with him. This also tells me they really didnt like JJ.",

            "Even if it is effectively a 2 year deal, that is 2 years out of the very limited rookie contract window you have with Penix. Sitting for 1 year is reasonable, but sitting for 2 is just wasting the cheapest years of your QB and putting yourself in position to make major decisions based on limited sample size. Sure, Kirk can get injured or regress any time and open the door for Penix to start before those 2 years are up, but you dont sign a guy to that kind of money if you are that concerned about him being injured you draft his backup with a top 8 pick. \n\nIf Penix starts during year 3, then you immediately have to decide on the 5th year option, which you would be doing based on one year of actual game tape. If it works out, it works out, but you definitely dont want to be in that situation. Because sure the 5th year option is cheap compared to what franchise QBs make post-rookie contract but for a top pick it is far from cheap and if that one year you based your taking of the option on ends up being a fluke, you're on the hook for that 5th year no matter what and you are stuck with it (remember when the Panthers took Darnold's 5th year?).\n\nStill have a hard time understanding why they would take the approach here. Like signing Kirk indicates an intent to win now. But you then use likely the best pick you will have the next few years in order to invest in a guy that most likely will not even be a factor for at least 2 years when you have literally every defensive player available as well as a guy who would be WR1 in many drafts. Lowkey if I am a Falcons fan and the team misses out on the division/a playoff spot by 1-2 games this season, I would be seething and Penix absolutely has to be a long-term superstar QB in order to make up for this.",

They're an OK team that had a shit tier QB. If anyone is this worried about Kirk, signing him doesn't make sense. The insurance policy is limiting the team's upside, if you're confident Penix was a legit starter there's no reason to have signed Kirk.",

Plus with a weak division and a 14 team playoff we're at least good enough to make it in, and at that point we could get on a luck run.\n\nThe cynical reason is that Blank is tired of losing seasons and declining attendance. Plus Fontenot wants to keep his job, and that would be tough to do if we struggled in Penix's (or whatever QB we ended up drafting) first year or two.",

            "The idea that QBs need game reps to grow as a player seems logical, so I get why it has been conventional wisdom forever, but it isn't backed up by historical precedent. The number of great QBs is quite small, but if anything, it seems like there is a slight opposite trend - many/most great QBs were not rookie week one starters (Brady, Mahomes, Rodgers, etc) and many of the first overall picks who have slotted into the week one start their rookie year have underperformed expectations (Andrew Luck is really the only one since Peyton Manning 25 years ago who was on a Hall of Fame type career trajectory until the injuries derailed his career).\n\nThe idea that sitting is better for development than starting seems counterintuitive at first, but it does have a logical basis. The backup QB is still practicing against the first team defense every week, so they get used to the speed and complexity of NFL defense in an environment where they won't be hit hard for holding onto the ball too long and no one who isn't a team employee will ever see the interceptions.\n\nI guarantee you that in their early practice scrimmages, Mahomes and Rodgers held the ball too long, made wrong reads, and threw bad picks the way Bryce Young and Jameis Winston did in live game action. We just never saw the footage, and their bodies didn't suffer the wear and tear of getting sacked over and over. We would need a larger sample to say for sure, but it is at least possible and maybe likely based on the small sample we do have that QBs develop better if they don't have to start as rookies.",

They got lucky enough that he's playing like a star AND lucked out that he played it safe and gave them a world of time.\n\nTo address your actual question: Based on their only previous dealing, I would be far more willing to believe that Love already has a number and Green Bay refuses to meet it. They have both dealt cautiously against their personal Risk of Ruin, with Love feeling he needed to raise the floor of his career earnings and Green Bay feeling they didn't want lock themselves into a bad situation by committing too much cap over too many years. Unless Love has now switched gears, which is definitely possible, its more likely to me that Green Bay is trying to negotiate Love down rather than Love trying to see the new price anchor.",

I\u2019m just willing to give the new regime the benefit of the doubt, since they\u2019re the ones with careers on the line.  My stake in the team is entertainment, and after watching completely inept QB play zap all entertainment value from the product, I\u2019m just not as upset about it as others.",

One had potential to give them a win-now boost, one gave them the potential to have high quality QB play long-term. No way to know for sure how one vs the other would turn out, so either route wasn\u2019t objectively wrong.\n\nBut so so many people seem to think the Falcons\u2019 choice was objectively wrong, and that there\u2019s no chance it will work out.

Maybe, but watch the film of weeks 1-4 and then watch his first game back after isolation.\n3. It wasn\u2019t just the fumble non-jump that killed his reputation, but because he was shell shocked and surly in the SB post game conference.

But It\u2019s amazing the positive spin that one 13-3 season did for him.",
            "I\u2019d agree somewhat. But it\u2019s more because people focus on perceived top 5 QBs or those who appear to be driving toward that.\n\nThink about the Flacco\u2019s and Luck\u2019s. Kirk has arguably been a better QB with less than either, but just never cracked the \u201cthe next great QB\u201d convo. Meanwhile, Flacco didn\u2019t materialize, but was in the elite debate (somewhat as a Harbaugh related joke), and Luck\u2019s out of the league due to retirement.\n\nMeanwhile here are just passer rating stats for the 3 (minimum 8 games started in the season):\nSeasons with 100+ rating:\nCousins: 4\nFlacco: 1\nLuck: 0\n\nSeasons with a sub 90 passer rating:\nCousins: 0\nFlacco: 9\nLuck: 2\n\nSeasons with a sub 80 passer rating:\nCousins: 0\nFlacco: 1\nLuck: 1\n\nCompare the narrative arcs for each of those players. Cousins is definitely underrated because he was never in the conversation, but having never had a season with a below 90 passer rating is actually impressive.\n\nNB: Honestly, I think that limiting it to 8 games is fair because that\u2019s half a season for most years, but Luck gets lucky here with his season in 2015 being nearly his worst, but he only played 7 games, so I excluded it.",

            "> Do people think he suddenly isn\u2019t good because the pass defense and Brian Johnson\u2019s play calling was terrible?\n\nIt isnt that I think he isnt good anymore after this past season. I dont think he was ever on that elite tier to begin with and the regression that we saw only furthers that imo. I'm not saying he isnt good. He has more than enough to prove that he is at least a very good QB but I never bought into the post-2022 hype that he was in the Mahomes/Burrow/Allen/Lamar tier. \n\nHis 2022 season was in literally as perfect of a situation as we possibly will ever see a young QB in. He had literally the best and most complete team in the league, top-to-bottom, which had arguably only one position you could actually call a weakness (LB). Literally the best OL in the game, 2 top 10 WR, a top 10 TE, a good RB, elite OC, a defense with 4 11+ sack guys and 2 elite corners. Hurts himself improved a lot and deserves his fair share of credit but after that season in that situation, it is hard to crown him as an MVP level QB until we know he can lift a less-than-perfect team. I'm not expecting him to carry the 2017 Browns to a Super Bowl to be considered elite. Every elite QB has great help, but the elite QBs are good enough to at least overcome some weaknesses on the roster (all the guys mentioned previously have done that, having major weaknesses on their rosters their whole career). We havent seen Hurts perform on that level without the 2022 superteam he had. Not saying he cant, but the only sample size we have of top tier play was in that perfect situation. Last year they brought back much of the same team, but the defense regressed, he lost his elite playcaller, and all of a sudden he isnt playing like he did the year before. Its hard to give benefit of the doubt that 2022 is closer to his true talent than 2023, but its also hard to make any sort of conclusive statement either way. Right now, we have about an equal sample size for both, and we are gonna need to see how he responds this season to see which is more accurate.\n\nRealistically Hurts probably is a bit better than he was in 2023 but I dont think he will be recreating anything close to his 2022 season.",

            "Too soon man... \ud83d\ude2d\n\nNGL tho I liked Brenden Rice and Ladd seems to be capable. If QJ can fix his hands the WR room might not turn out to be as bad as it looks on paper.",
            "It was prime time but later in the season. 51 - 48, and yes there was a lot of \u201cYeah he scored 48 points, but\u2026\u201d discourse. \n\nI felt like I was taking crazy pills.",
            "Kirk's playoff stats are great. I made another comment in this thread about it but basically he has 254 yds/game, 71% completion, and 5-1 TD/INT in 4 games played.",
            "Only reason \u201cHerbert\u201d scored 30. Those interceptions don\u2019t happen I\u2019m willing to bet Jags blow them out.",
            "If your defense lets up 51 points and you lose, it\u2019s not the QB\u2019s fault. It\u2019s insane that anybody suggests otherwise.",
            "Yep, and something like 28+ points against per game",
            "Kirk is a great QB.  He showed that to us this year.  He was absolutely on point against us.  Completing really difficult passes with pressure in his face.  Was one of the best performances I saw all year from any QB.  Atlanta should be dangerous this year.   The team has real talent."
