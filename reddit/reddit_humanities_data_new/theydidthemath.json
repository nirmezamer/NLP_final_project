However, we can see that the stone is still normal stone, so he must be above Y = 0. Thus, I\u2019ll make assumptions based on the following cases:\n\nA. Somewhere around Y = 30 (fairly deep hole)\n\nB. At Y = 10 (really deep hole)\n\nBoth assumptions assume that he exits the shaft at Y = 70 (it looks like he dug through a hill, so that would add a few blocks)\n\nIn either case, I think I was able to count 4 frames between launch and exiting the hole. I\u2019m on mobile so I can\u2019t check the exact frame rate, but I\u2019ll assume 60 FPS. 4 frames at 60 FPS = 1/15 of a second, so he\u2019s going anywhere between 600 to 900 m/s as a rough guess.",

So either 6 is second or third, 1 is first or third or 4 is first or second.\n \nLogically 6 cannot be first and (second or third) so it's not part of the solution.\n \nThat means that either 8 is second or 2 is third. And either 1 is first or third, or 4 is first or second.\n \nThe third clue says two Digits are correct but wrongly placed. \n  \nWe know that 6 is not part of the solution, so 2 and 0 are part of the solution. The other digit has to be either 1 or 4 because of the second locker. So there's no 8, thus 2 has to be third.

We know 0 is in the code from 206, so 6 or 2 must be the correct number here, but since 2 would have to be in the last position to match the well-placed hint from 682 and 0 is not in the third position (from 206), 6 must be the correct and well-placed number here.\n\nSo, the code must start with 6.\n\n- From 614, 1 or 4 is the correct number but in the wrong place. From 682 and 206, 6 is already correct and well placed. So, the remaining number in 614 must be 1 or 4, but it is wrongly placed.\n- From 206, since 2 must be wrongly placed, the only remaining number is 0 in the second or third place.\n\nTherefore, the code is 042. Let's check the hints to confirm:\n- **682**: 6 is correct and well placed.\n- **614**: 1 is correct but wrongly placed.\n- **206**: 0 and 2 are correct but wrongly placed.\n- **738**: 7, 3, and 8 are incorrect.\n- **780**: 0 is correct but wrongly placed.\n\nSo, the correct code is **042**.",

            "Jean Mermoz, a French aviator from the A\u00e9ropostale, friend of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, did this in 1927, flying a Lat\u00e9 17 plane : \n\n\u00ab\u00a0*Stranded at an altitude of four thousand meters on a plateau with vertical walls, he and his mechanic spent two days trying to escape. They were caught. So they gambled their last chance, launching the plane into the void, bouncing hard on the uneven ground, until they reached the precipice, where they sank. In the fall, the plane finally gained enough speed to obey the controls again. Mermoz righted it against a ridge, touched down on it, and, with water spurting from all the frost-battered tubes, already out of action after seven minutes of flight, discovered the Chilean plain beneath him, like a Promised Land.* \u00bb\n\nWind, Sand and Stars, from Antoine de Saint-Exupery (1939).",
            "It depends on the jet's specs, but at least 1147 meters in a simplified scenario.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Jet's take-off speed (assume 150 m/s)\n- Initial height\n- Air resistance \n- Aircraft mass and aerodynamics\n\nIgnoring the air resistance and aerodynamics:\n\nvelocity = \u221a(2gh)\n150 = \u221a(2 * 9.8 * h)\nheight \u2248 1147m\ntime = \u221a(2h/g) \u2248 15.3s\n\nSo the cliff needs to be at least 1147 meters high without using the engine, ignoring air resistance and the direction the fighter jet is pointing.",
            "Getting an actual number would require detailed knowledge of the plane\u2019s aerodynamics. For example: the pilot might use flaps, which add lift and reduce takeoff speed at the expense of drag. Or not, which is another calculation. Then there\u2019s the fact that even if you reach \u201ctakeoff speed\u201d, your nose is pointing at the ground, so you also have to pull up to at least level flight - which means you need more height, but also more aerodynamic data. \n\nIf you look at videos of the Red Bull Flugtag, some of those unpowered gliders do achieve level flight for short periods, after a drop of just a few metres. It would be very different for a F-16. A very rough guess from me would be at least 2000m, but without power you\u2019re not going very far. Fighter jets are not made to glide.",
            "the drag coefficient(C) for the F-16 aircraft is **0.019,** the wing area(A) is 300 ft\u00b2, and the dynamic pressure(p) is 134 lb/ft\u00b2.  but wait is this drop unpowered or are we at idle, cruise, or full throttle oooooooooooooooor afterburn full thrust?  i'd argue that if in this position, \"takeoff\" has been achieved.  goal posts of the dive are now to pull to level... weight is now on the table, are we fully fueled? lord the pedantic door is wide, air density/temp/wind...\n\nafrican swallows can do this pull to level glide (short distance to land \"on wing\" or nothing, they got good adaptive suspension) in a few meters or if \"under power\", exactly zero meters.  oddly for them, maintaining free fall actually adds distance to pull to level flight.",
            "Some Googling states that the F22 has a takeoff speed of 165 mph (74 m/s) and can reach that speed on the flat in 10 seconds. That means it can accelerate on the flat at 7.4 m/s^2. With gravity as well it would bring the acceleration up to 17.2 m/s^2. This means that it would need to fly vertically downward at full thrust for about 4.3 seconds to reach takeoff speed. Assuming uniform acceleration it\u2019s average speed during that time would be 37 m/s meaning that it would have traveled about 160m.\n\nAfter this the aircraft would need to pull out of the dive and that would require extra space. I don\u2019t know how much.\n\nSo overall 160m plus enough space to pull out of the dive if the pilot has the engines at full throttle.",
            "What a gem.",
            "I know we are often taught to ignore air resistance but in this case, specifically for a plane, it seems wrong. 1147 m is a huge fall",
            "The highest cliff in the world is [Mount Thor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Thor) with a vertical drop of 1,200 meters.",
            "Boooooooo! I come here to see people try to have a crack! Not just say \"too hard\" and take a guess! They did not do the math!",
            "Another question is, if he is runing the engine in addition to gravity... But i think the 2km you guessed is way too much... I would say probably less than 300m with engine and another 300 to pull up...",
            "1. Obviously make assumptions\n\n2. You know the aerodynamics, there's a picture with the model and configuration\n\n3. 2KM is waaaaay to much.\n\n4. OP didn't ask about gliding constantly.",
            "then what is the airspeed velocity of the african swallow?",
            "Air resistance would only make the fall have to be longer to reach the same end speed",
            "So you're telling me there's a chance...",
            "I guess he just didnt know and couldnt do the math but wanted to feel smart."

            "One said:\n\nThere are problems...The amount of blood, for example. He assumes 60% of the body by weight is \"water\". The scripture specifies the blood of Christ, not the lymph of Christ, interstitial fluid of Christ, or the digestive fluids of Christ.\n\nCall it 5 litres of blood, converted to wine apparently to make it palatable.\n\nIt could also be argued that Jesus probably wouldn't want people eating his gross parts. Call it 35 kilograms of edible Jesus. 35,000 grams. Times 4, 140,000. 35 kilograms of tasty son of God is 140 thousand unleavened morsels.\n\nYou could probable finish this off in a month.",
            "Another one said:\n\nWine has a higher 'gravity level' of 1.5kg/L? That's an enormous overestimate. Even honey is only 1.43kg/L. Wine is basically flavoured water with alcohol in it so it's slightly less dense than water at 0.99kg/L.",
            "Based on what I remember from my Catholic school, it doesn't work that way and every single communion is a whole Jesus. Still funny though.",
            "Yeah, but you need the priest to do his magic and turn  the unleavened morsels into Jesus cookies.\n\nIf you only go to one church each week, you would need 2,692 years. If you go to church every day, and eat one per visit you need more than 383 years.",
            "Gravity Level = density.\nYou have to consider more than just the alcohol. Wine has dissolved auger etc in it. Also there is the volume contraction of water alcohol mixtures. I just googled the density and it is 1.1 kg/L",
