I vaguely remember one point she mentioned was that she had to purchase drapes\u00a0for their house, which he refused to contribute to. In the end, she called him out for his financial abuse of her and left him. He was planning to sell the house that she hated anyway because he bought it for his gold digger ex.\u00a0",

They\u2019re both brilliant. Both lecturers at the University and they have so much in common. I am not stupid but I never loved school and I have high school education. They have become best friends throughout the years (14 years) but never once did I feel uncomfortable about it since my husband has shown me nothing but love and respect. The opposite. Until now I counted myself lucky that the two people that I love the most in this world get along so well.\n\nBut now, I feel nauseated. The bestie sent me screenshots upon screenshots of her conversation with my sister. My sister has feelings for my husband and she appears to know that my husband feels the same way about her too. In one of the texts, my sister wrote that she loved me too much to do anything to hurt me. In another she wrote that I am too dear to both her and my husband to do anything that would hurt me.\n\nShe seems to think that they\u2019re soulmates which is odd because the talk about soulmates came up once between my husband and I when I told him that I didn\u2019t want us to be soulmates. He was curious and ask me why, I told him because soulmates meant that we are \u201cprogrammed\u201d or \u201cdestined\u201d to fit together. There\u2019s no free will involved and I want my love to come from a free space not a predestined place. He laughed and said he loved that. But apparently they\u2019re soulmates?\n\nI know that I need to talk to him but I am dreading that. I am in so much despair right now.\ud83d\udc94\n\n***Relevant Comment:***\n\nCommenter: If what the friend sent you is true, you need to take a moment and gather your thoughts before this talk you need to have with your husband, if possible check his phone so you have first hand look at the comunnication not the friends one. If real the emotional affair is more than enough of a betrayal.\n\n>**OOP:** For me even an emotional affair is a deal breaker, unfortunately.\n\n**Edit (Same post, Same day)**\n\nHi! Thanks for your help. I asked how I would be sure before asking my husband so he doesn\u2019t just blatantly lie and you suggested to look into his phone. Thanks for your suggestion.\n\nI did now. I told him about my sister\u2019s conversations with her best friend and showed him the screenshots. He was shocked at first and said he had no romantic feelings for her and he had no idea about her feelings, so I asked to see his phone.\n\nI read their texts and emails. And I was shocked that their contact is way more intensive and intense than I thought. They talk on a daily basis. They have lunch multiple times a week. Nothing sexual in the texts but yeah, he is stupid if he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d that she loves him, and he must think that I am stupid if after reading, I wouldn\u2019t get the feeling that he has some feelings too.\n\nIn one of her texts, she wrote that she wished they had met first and under different circumstances. His answer wasn\u2019t totally dismissive. He wrote yeah, it would probably have been different. When I asked him about it, he said well yeah, if he didn\u2019t know and love me he would probably have been interested in another, my sister included. But he loves me and she is a close friend of his.\n\nSo there\u2019s no sexual relationship between them, but I am not sure that is enough for me. I think they are both wrong and should have nipped it in the bud way earlier. I don\u2019t know what to do now. I think I need time for myself to process this. I don\u2019t feel well at all about this and I don\u2019t want to make decisions from a place of fear and hurt nor convenience.\n\nI am sorry I can\u2019t answer all private messages. Because I don\u2019t use my phone that often. But our ages are: my husband is 45. I am 42. My sister is 38. My husband and I have been together for 16 years and married for 14. My sister is single. I am not a stay at home mom. I have my own business. We don\u2019t have children. My sister has 2 from a previous relationship.\n\n**Update (Same Post): May 9, 2024 (Next Day)**\n\nSo now I have had some long talks and discussions with my husband. He seems to think that this is getting bigger than it is supposed to because I told him that I needed time alone to think and digest this. He said that he doesn\u2019t understand why I am this hurt since he loves me and nobody else. I didn\u2019t relent however and he admitted that he knows that my sister is in love with him because she has told him so. But she knows that nothing can happen between them so she is fine with just friendship(martyr). He loves her but not romantically and he is happy to have a friend like her. Their friendship is important to him and he doesn\u2019t want it to end because I don\u2019t trust him and his love for me.\n\nHe made a comparison to my best friend and asked what I would think if he asked me to cut my best friend from my life. He admitted that \u201cintellectually\u201d he has more in common with her than with me but that the heart doesn\u2019t always choose who we are more \u201ccompatible\u201d and that he loves and is physically attracted to me. I think this whole situation is messed up. I am repulsed by them both. I texted my sister all her screenshots and she wrote that she was disappointed in her bestie and that \u201cyour husband is all yours because I would never let anything happen that would hurt you because you are the most important person to me\u201d\n\nIn other words they are both contradicting each other since both seem to believe that they are the one who is not letting a \u201crelationship\u201d between them grow for my sake.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*On them meeting for lunch:*\n\n>About the lunches, he says that it is because they both work at the university and they eat lunch when both are in office. But tgat isn\u2019t true because they don\u2019t work in the same building.\n\nCommenter: How did he act? Was he truly shocked? Why did he hide how intense their communication was?\n\n>**OOP:** He was probably more shocked that my sister is talking to her friend about this. Otherwise he knows everything and probably likes it or he would have stopped it.\n\nCommenter: Other women\u2019s husbands are not your soulmates.\n\nAs an academic, i know academics are often very emotionally dysregulated individuals inclined to asbtract and even magical thinking. Are you sure she isn\u2019t delusional? They both sound like idiots.\n\n>**OOP:** They are idiots yes. If I was her, and I had developed feelings to my sister\u2019s husband I would have nibbed it immediately. She is not a heroine for \u201cnot wanting to hurt me and sacrificing her happiness instead.  \n>  \n>If I was him, I would have immediately gone no contact with someone who has feelings for me (if we are to believe that he doesn\u2019t reciprocate her feelings like he is pretending) if I had any respect for my spouse.  \n>  \n>So they are both idiots yes\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/DentistBig7041/comments/1dgo8t1/my_stbxhs_and_my_sisters_love_for_me_was_worth/)**: June 15, 2024 (1 month and 1 week later)**\n\nI have written here and a few comments about my soon to be ex husband and my sister. I left him about a week after and he texted me day and night about how much he loved me and wanted me back then he just stopped. That\u2019s when I found out that my sister left her children at my parents\u2019 house and moved in with my husband. This made everything come out to the rest of my family and my parents were shocked and my mother really looked like she was already showing ptsd symptoms. About how disgusting she felt this whole thing was. She kept calling it incest and asking is that even legal.\n\nI guess that is how much my sister \u201ccared\u201d not to hurt me(if you read my first post). Even though I have been well composed and calm that I surprised myself, I still tried my hardest to look back on my whole life, childhood and upbringing to understand when it all went so wrong. What my sister did felt like something that was the result of years of resentment or at least indifference towards me and our relationship as sisters, so how did I miss that? She never cared about me did she? If she didn\u2019t how could I have been so blind?\n\nThen not even a week later, I heard that they have ended things. I found out in the oddest way possible. My sister texted me. The first time she texted me since everything started. She just wrote \u201cYou b , I hope you burn in life and in hell\u201d. I was very confused because she spent that week sharing cheesy \u201cdeep\u201d quotes about love and soul mates and romantic insta stories with my stbxh. But apparently that was over. Stbxh has blocked her everywhere and she moved out. Because she came to my parents to get her children and had a meltdown when they asked for explanation. Stbxh started calling and texting me again asking me to meet because he wanted to explain because he loved me and wanted me to understand. He wanted to meet at least once before we started to meet with the lawyers involved.\n\nSo that is that. This has left me even more confused than if they just ended up together. I understand falling out and in love. Breaking up and starting anew but I can\u2019t explain this. My stbxh keeps calling me his only love and true friend and my sister, until I left kept promising that she would never do anything to hurt me. She left her children at my parents\u2019 doorstep and didn\u2019t answer their calls or texts for a week.\n\nAnd all of this for a week? What were they thinking? Has anyone here heard of something like this happening? People throwing everything for not even a week?\n\n**True Off My Chest** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1dgox24/my_soon_to_be_ex_husband_and_my_sister_threw/)**: June 15 (Same Day)**\n\nAfter one week of \u201cbeing in love\u201d and my sister leaving her children at my parents door to be living in my home with my soon to be ex husband and flaunting everything on social media and sharing cheesy quotes, she moved back to her apartment and got her children from my parents. They aren\u2019t friends on fb and he unfollowed her on instagram. Now she is saying that I have ruined her happiness and he started texting me again begging me to talk in private because he needed to explain everything before we started getting our lawyers involved between us.\n\nI understand that people fall out of love and sometimes they can\u2019t control who they fall for and they can hurt many people around them but I never heard of two people throwing everything they pretended to care about for one week.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter: \u201cSpeak to my attorney.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d have that as my outgoing voice message.\n\n>**OOP:** I haven\u2019t answered any calls from him, his family or unknown numbers. I don\u2019t answer any texts either.\n\nComment: Men\u00a0come and go, but a sister doing this is a fucking abomination.\u00a0\n\nI could not imagine betraying my sisters like this.\u00a0\n\nShe ruined her owned dammed life. What is she blaming you for? Being married to her affair partner?\u00a0\n\nI'd let her bitch ass have him.\u00a0\n\n>**OOP:** She can most certainly have him.\n\nCommenter: She can most certainly have him.\n\n>**OOP:** I dont have great relationship with his family, especially his mother. We lost our child and they blamed me for us not wanting more children afterwards, when it was both\u2019s decision\n\nCommenter: It\u2019s even worse that they are harassing you on his behalf.\n\nAlso sorry for your loss (child and relationships)\n\n>**OOP:** I don\u2019t know if they are harassing me on his behalf to be honest since I haven\u2019t answered them. They could be as confused as I am and he could be ghosting them.  \n>  \n>Not taking any chances anyway  \n>  \n>Thank you\u2764\ufe0f\n\nCommenter: So they actually admitted to being together? Did they admit to the affair?\n\n>**OOP:** I don\u2019t know tbh. I don\u2019t think he knew that I knew they were together until he found out she was sharing it on instagram\n\nCommenter: I remember your first post!\n\nWhat threw me was him giving a whole spiel on how he loves you & doesn\u2019t love your sister in that way & the first thing he does is move your sister into y\u2019alls home.\n\nHe\u2019s living in regret right now! These two are probably still in contact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they end back together, smh! Onward & upward\n\n>**OOP:** I don\u2019t think they are still in contact no\n\nCommenter: This is the thing with infatuation/crush. You build someone up in your mind, but the reality is so very different. It's funny that it only took 1 week for them to fall apart. Your sister dumping her kids speaks volumes about the type of person she is. I hope her life is hell, I hope karma fucks her to the maximum. Go see him, let him explain, get your closure, and for the love of all that is holy, cut your sister off.\n\n>**OOP:** As much I am confused and want answers, I don\u2019t want to get them from him. I don\u2019t know how the divorce will be done and if I am going to need to see him or not, hopefully not but if it happens, my lawyer cnndo the talking.  \n>  \n>That\u2019s why I am here instead, maybe people here have experience of something similar and can explain wtf happened these past two months\n\n&#x200B;",

The STBX still sees her as a genuine friend (they\u2019ve been friends for 14 years bear in mind), and accepts her in to stay for a while.

After 2 or  so months, I got a random Facebook dm from some woman, telling me she and him were together, she was 1 week (!) pregnant with his child, had met his parents, they were going to move in etc etc. I was like, and? What you telling me for? I nearly didn't bother replying,  but just sent a short, curt, reply saying I was no longer in contact with this man, and to speak with him if they were having issues. What I suspect happened was he realised she was a bit delulu, and used me as an excuse, that we'd been together 6 years, still had some feelings for me, and he wasn't ready to move on so fast. So she blamed me.\nI guess there's a little of that happening here, stbx saw sisters insta postings,  heard all her declarations of love, plans for the future etc, shit got a bit too real for him, and he claimed to still love his wife, it was a mistake etc Hence sis blaming op when she realised op still had power over him, even though she had no desire to even flex that power. It's still op's fault, and not her own that her dream didn't work out. Ironically,  if she'd waited it out, let the separation play out, hadn't moved so fast, stbx probably would've gone crawling to her once he realised op was serious about divorce...",

He proposed six months later and told me he knew I was the one when he met me and that he didn\u2019t want to waste time or lose me. I was (still is) head over heels and agreed. We have been married for 6 months and expecting our first baby.\n\nLast weekend we bumped into his ex. They were together for 9 years but she ended the relationship when he didn\u2019t take the relationship to the next level. When we got engaged and married my husband texted her to tell her and to apologize and talked about fate and how some things aren\u2019t meant to be. I remember asking him why, he said that he owed it to her that so she doesn\u2019t hear it from other people and not be prepared. They broke up 3 years ago (edit not 4; it was October-December 2021; bad math).\n\nShe was pregnant and holding hands with a kid that could be 7 or 8 years old and she was with a man who was obviously her partner and they were very affectionate towards each other. My husband said hi even though we could walk by unnoticed by them but he insisted to talk.\n\nWhen we got home I heard him crying in the bathroom . Now he has been depressed and distant the whole week. I realized he must\u2019ve written to her after we got home and he showed me his phone and yes he has. Again apologized for what he did and told her that some things are not meant to be.\n\nWould I be the ah if I confronted him about what\u2019s going on? Why is he doing this\n\nEdit: throwaway. I dont want him finding me\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter (downvoted): If you think his emotional reaction means you're coming in \"second\" or that he still has feelings for her, that seems like such a waste. You are pregnant with this man's child! His ex is pregnant and in a happy relationship! You are obviously the one he is with.\u00a0 The fact that he HAD feelings for his ex does not indicate that he \"settled\" for you!\u00a0 Please, do not succumb to this black and white thinking.\u00a0 \u00a0You have a husband who has every right to feelings and emotions. It sounds like he handled this situation with grace and dignity.\u00a0 \u00a0I think he does need to cut communication with her completely in order to focus on his life. He had this moment of closure, you are both pregnant. Don't sabotage this with some bs about needing to be first. Or else go find a virgin/ guy who has never been in a serious relationship and be that guy's first...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n>**OOP:** Ughhhhhh your picture of \u201chandling things with grace and dignity\u201d are totally different to mine and that is ok. I respectfully disagree with everything you said here and I am sorry but I am following my gut feeling which is often strong and true\n\nCommenter: Don\u2019t end the relationship yet. Level with him about how you feel. Talk to him. Tell him. Give him the chance to come to his senses and double-down on you. Once you tell him exactly how this makes you feel, he should move heaven and earth to try to repair the damage with you. If he does not, then you will know what to do.\n\n>**OOP:** That\u2019s the plan. I will give him a chance to choose me. Maybe confronting was the wrong word I used in my post. More like tell him how I feel and let him explain and them decide if his explanation is good enough for me.  \n>  \n>Many are suggesting therapy. I don\u2019t think it works for me, ar least not if he doesn\u2019t choose me. I don\u2019t believe therapy changes what in the heart but only gives you tools to hide it better  \n>  \n>Therapy only works if both parties has chosen each other and need tooks to communicate that\n\nCommenter: NTA. The fact he 1/ texted her, 2/ cried and 3/ worst of all, has been distant is a red flag, it shows that he is NOT over her and he cannot even control those feelings and act normal towards you.\n\nFrankly, it looks like he wishes he were still with her, and settled for you just because he couldn\u2019t keep her.\n\n>**OOP:** But that\u2019s the thing, he could have kept her if he wanted. The break up was because he didn\u2019t want marriage and children\n\nCommenter: And now he realizes he fucked up and only got his second choice.\n\nSorry honey, but we all have exes, and yet we don\u2019t get all mopey about them. If I met my ex today and he was with his family, I wouldn\u2019t be sad - I be very happy for him!\n\nEven I acknowledge that my exes were good guys, they have zero emotional power over me\u2026 Because my husband is 100% of what I want. I\u2019m sure your husband is fond of you. But he doesn\u2019t love you with all of his heart because if he did, there would be no space for her years after their breakup.\n\n>**OOP:** Same here! I have loved before and I have had exes. I would never have felt anything if I met my ex with a new woman because I don\u2019t care about them emotionally\n\nCommenter: She's the one who got away.\n\n>**OOP:** That is what I want to understand. How did she get away? He had her for 9 years and didn\u2019t want to make the commitment  \n>  \n>(to a different commenter): She left him because he didn\u2019t want to get married or have children. I never got the sense that the break up was devastating to him just that they wanted different things\n\nCommenter: Why have you\u2019ve rushed every aspect of your relationship? Like, that\u2019s absolutely insane, to be married *and* expecting in under 2 years. I say that as someone who got married on my 2 year anniversary. That\u2019s nuts. It sounds like he was trying to prove a point and is obviously still in love with his ex and using you to avoid mourning his last relationship.\n\n>**OOP:** Because I am stupid and thought it was so romantic and \u201cmeant to be\u201d  \n>  \n>People can fool you to believe that they love you so much and there\u2019s no point in waiting.\n\nCommenter: Um, they broke up three years ago but she has a child who is 7 or 8? Are you sure that he didn't abandon his kid?\n\n>**OOP:** Yes I am sure  \n>  \n>(different comment): I suppose it is the child of her partner or some relative of theirs  \n>  \n>(third reply to a downvoted comment) Because the majority probably didn\u2019t need explaining that the exfg is dating a father and or the boy is just a family member\n\nCommenter: Am I the only person who is wondering why this chick hasn\u2019t blocked his number yet? If she hasn\u2019t, she obviously has some sort of emotional attachment to him even at a minimal level. Seems a bit strange to me.\n\n>**OOP:** Maybe she has? She never answers hom\n\n**Update (same post): June 15, 2024 (6 hours later)**\n\n*OOP shows her husband this top comment:*\n\nu/UncleNedisDead: NTA, but it sounds like that cliche story.\n\nGuy is happy with status quo and keeping the gf around for 9 years and while he says he\u2019s open to the idea of marriage (to string her along), he believes it\u2019s unnecessary and doesn\u2019t actually make plans to get an engagement ring or pop the question. He just assumes if he runs the clock, she will be stuck with him for life\n\nHis Ex decides that she\u2019s had enough of his placating words and realizes if she wants to get married and start a family, it can\u2019t/won\u2019t be with him. After she takes charge of her life and dumps him, he begs her to take him back and that he will give her the ring and wedding that she wanted, but it\u2019s too little, too late. Curtains close on this relationship.\n\nHe takes a year or so to heal, and then finds you, who checks off most of his boxes and instead of risking the same thing happening again, he proposes to you in six months of dating and everything happens at warp speed because he has learned from his last serious relationship. Don\u2019t leave it up to chance. Don\u2019t string someone along.\n\nHim bumping into his ex make him realize he still had feelings for the \u201cone who got away\u201d. That if he hadn\u2019t been so stubborn and slow about getting a ring and making his ex happy, that could have been him.\n\n>Again apologized for what he did and told her that some things are not meant to be.\n\nHe keeps telling himself that because it\u2019s easier to blame fate and absolve himself about being a shit boyfriend who was wasting her time and ruined the relationship singlehandedly.\n\nI\u2019m glad his ex got her happy ending.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your marriage is starting to show cracks because your husband may be incapable of love and had a hidden agenda when marrying you. He might have married you to \u201cprove\u201dto his ex he could commit (like when he texted her about the engagement), rather than because of his deep and lasting love for you.\n\n**OOP's Comment Update**\n\nHi again! I hope you read this!\n\nSo I showed my husband this comment and I told him that this was basically how I feel things were but that someone else wrote it better. First he got upset and defensive then he started arguing and telling me to leave him alone (I have, for a week been nothing but supportive and leaving him alone)\n\nThen he started crying and asked to read it again. He sat silent for like in like 15 minutes reading it but not once did her deny or try denying it or call me crazy or at least tried to explain.\n\nIf I know myself, this is over. I don\u2019t play second fiddle. I don\u2019t do consolation prize and I absolutely am not going to have another woman being the main character in my own story. So I told him this was over and that I need a break to sort out my feelings but that this will eventually end in divorce because I know myself very well.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything, ANYTHING. Just sat silent. I know his type. The only way he will realize my worth is when he has lost me. Just like he did his ex. People like him are frugal with their feelings. He strung her along because he didn\u2019t want to give her all of him then he turned around and gave me exactly what she wanted but deprived me from exactly what I wanted that he gave her. Men like him will never give all of themselves because he probably thinks he would lose control if he gave all of him to a woman.\n\nWhat a waste of a man.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter: I\u2019m so sorry OP but good on you for knowing your worth. Be glad you aren\u2019t like her and wait 9 years to figure it out. Good luck for the future and with the little one\n\n>**OOP:** I learned from her mistakes.

But showing him a comment with some pseudo-psychoanalysis and watching him be silent and then taking his silence to mean agreement is wild. Silence is not agreement, remember? It could also be shock at how differently he's being perceived compared to how he's experiencing things.\n\nSure, those commenters could be right about him. But they could also be wrong, and because of it, oop may have tanked her own marriage, because she trusted redditors' analysis rather than having a proper in-depth talk with her husband.

Maybe he proposed after six months because he knew he waited too long with the ex and didn't want to repeat the same mistake with OOP. Maybe he was depressed because he went out of his way to apologize for how he acted and to let her know he learned his lesson so she wouldn't find out from someone else and she didn't. \n\nThis feels like OOP is self-sabotaging the relationship. That over the course of six hours, he got an emotional gut punch, she went to reddit, showed him (while he's still upset) the post where she's complaining about him being emotional, then decided to divorce him because \"I know his type\"? We don't know the full story but everyone kind of comes across as a little bit wrong and OOP could've at least waited a day, maybe tried talking to him like an adult, see what the reason was instead of \"You're just a man, Fuck off.

He dated a friend of mine when we were teenagers and all 4 years or so they were together he was pining over a lesbian friend of his. \"If she one day happened to wake up and discover she liked men also I would dump you right away to see if I have a chance with her\" is literally what he said to her and also to me since we were good friends at that point. We were kids and stupid. \n\nThey broke up, fast forward 6 years or so and he started to woo me. Told me how he had had a crush on me ever since he was still with my friend. Stupid from me I know but he knew exactly what to do and say and the wooing worked. But from the moment I was willing to put the official title on us like he wanted he was working overtime and had no time for me. Long distance relationship with little warmth inbetween. When we did meet once per month he was very very sparing with his affection, when he was away it was even colder. We had one single fight after which I dumped him (he aimed to hurt with words from the start during the fight) - suddenly he had tears in his eyes and told me he loved me for the first time ever. I still refused to continue the farce that was that relationship and ended it.\n\n\nHe called me for years 2-3 times per year to mull on our relationship, trying to lure me in with money, promising to buy me a house, have kids, marriage etc. I am pretty sure I became the ghost from the past he told his new girls about that he would leave them for. I should have blocked him but I hoped that going back to being friends was possible somehow.\nNaive, I know.\n\n\n\nI have heard of similar men from others and they are all so so so similar, the only thing that differs is their ability to trick themselves into believing they actually truly love someone they are actually with.\n\n\n\nOOP is strong. And wise. None of us deserve to be overshadowed by ghosts from the past. We deserve more than crumbs.

Nearly every adventure or experience he could tell people about involved his ex. Because of course it did. And it was never a problem.\n\nWhat *was* a problem, was that he built a mental model of me and what I'm like, and it repeatedly showed to not match the real me, and I kept being stumped as to how to get through to him. So I eventually gave up and left. He tells a vastly different story of my choices and motivations than I do. And while I obviously don't know whether that's the case with oop, it *is* a possibility, and this was not even considered before jumping to divorce.\n\nThis is the exact type of story that gives reddit that poor reputation of jumping straight to divorce on ridiculous grounds.",

            "I feel like a big part of the problem is the significant lack of nuance on the internet. \n\nAfter a year you should have a general idea within a relationship that you are both heading in the same direction in life and you both want the same kind of things like kids or places you want to live or things you want to do. That doesn't, of course, mean you need to be engaged or married at the end of that year.\n\nAfter 2 or 3 years of stable adult relationship, it would be more understandable to say marriage or bust. But a year is just... no time at all really. If you're working full-time, that's what, 52 weekends spent together and maybe a vacation? And that's assuming you're spending every single free moment with them.",
            "EXACTLY! It's going to be the same cycle, again, but with their kid. He's going to string this kid along with \"I'm sorry I'm just so busy right now\" and \"I promise I'll be there next time\" over and over again, until finally the kid ditches him for a more present parental figure, then it's going to be the woeful cry of \"She turned them against me!\" or \"You can't call him dad, I'm you're REAL dad!\" He refuses to put in any effort or commitment into his relationships, and then expects people to just fill in the gaps for him, as if he's some sort of unmatched catch.",

            "HAHAHA yes. This is it.\u00a0\n\n\nI was honestly still on the husband's \"side\" by thinking maybe he was just greiving a sort of \"lost life\" and that he'd explain himself to OOP and be like \"I just needed some time it was a shock to see my ex who I hadn't thought about at all since marrying, I realise that our relationship fell apart because I was stagnant and to be Honest I had to mourn a little of what could have been with her due to my obtuseness.

            "Haha exactly! \n\nWhen she tells her next partner why left is going to be fucking hilarious. \n\n\u201cOh yeah, he was processing the end of his previous 9 year relationship and I just couldn\u2019t handle that so I left his ass while I was pregnant with his kid.

Especially men who are notoriously ill-trained to handle their own emotions much less put them into words.\n\nLike I said, he's obviously got some unprocessed stuff to handle. You know how you explain unprocessed stuff? You don't, because it's still unprocessed, and he may only just then have realised he has a bunch of unprocessed stuff going on. If that's the case, he likely doesn't even know where nor how to start.\n\nPeople spend years in therapy and you expect him to have it all figured in a week - easily even. And what's more, oop thinks *she* with reddit's help have him figured. This is wild to me.\n\nI remain no less baffled about how poorly people seem to understand that other humans are not exactly like themselves.",
            "yeah that's a very uncharitable way to look at OOP. OOP also said:\n\n>So I showed my husband this comment and I told him that this was basically how I feel things were but that someone else wrote it better.\n\nso she already felt that way but couldn't express it that well, i didn't take it to mean she got all the assumptions from a reddit comment. plus how is it on her to have \"a proper talk\" when he doesn't say anything for a week? how much longer was she supposed to wait here?",
            "Now, that analysis seems solidly founded.\n\nI definitely won't be one to advocate them staying together. Lack of healthy communication is a valid reason to give up on a relationship - I've done so. But they have a child on the way. They're going to need to communicate about that sooner or later, and I fear reddit's advice and analysis regarding motivations and character may have made it harder for them rather than easier - even if divorce is the right choice for now.",
            "They simply mentioned being surprised by the original assumptions that were made. They literally said, \u201cOop could be right, they could be wrong.\u201d",
            "No. I offered an alternative explanation. I never said that's how it was. Oop has known her husband for 2 years. She barely knows him and she didn't have time to wait for him to figure himself out. She decided that reddit knew him better than he knows himself, and without a real conversation, she's off towards the sunset. It's wild to make such a decision based on only hunches and reddit-affirmations.",
            "Bingo. We need to do better with ourselves and our children. But it\u2019s hard. How do I teach my children what I don\u2019t even know how to do myself?\n\nIt\u2019s a rough cycle for men. We don\u2019t know how to learn this, we are encouraged not to and I\u2019ll be honest that a lot of women who COULD help us learn just don\u2019t want to deal with teaching us. \n\nSo we are stuck.",
            "Agree completely.\u00a0 But I also don't like the \"soft engagement\" of \"I need you to agree we'll get married by the end of college\" or anything like that either, even if that's 3 years out.\u00a0 Basically below 23 don't get married lol.",
            "And then if he ends up with another kid after he messes up his chances with his first kid he's going to over-correct *again* and will spoil that kid so much they turn out to be a brat.",

Then later find him crying in the bathroom again possibly texting both his exes that things weren\u2019t meant to be.",
            "> And what's more, oop thinks she with reddit's help have him figured. This is wild to me.\n\nOr maybe she, who has known him for two years in real life, does have him figured out. Maybe she doesn\u2019t, but your *assumption* that she doesn\u2019t understand him is just as much of an *assumption* as anything else.",
            "They are implying that OP did what she did solely because of what commenters said, and not her own judgement on her own marriage.",
            "She\u2019s not making a decision over hunches and Reddit affirmations. She made the decision after seeing her own husbands reactions. \n\n> So I showed my husband this comment\u2026 First he got upset and defensive then he started arguing and telling me to leave him alone (I have, for a week been nothing but supportive and leaving him alone)\n\n> Then he started crying and asked to read it again. He sat silent for like in like 15 minutes reading it but not once did her deny or try denying it or call me crazy or at least tried to explain.\n\nWhy are you assuming that she\u2019s ending it based on nothing and not the way her husband is acting? You are also making assumptions here by claiming that \u201cShe decided that reddit knew him better than he knows himself\u201d, rather than that there may have been other things in their marriage we don\u2019t know about that likely informed her actions. You are making assumptions as much as anyone else.",

People who are accused of something that never even crossed their minds, comes completely out of left field in their perception, and who is beginning to realise they don't know the person they're with.\n\nI'm not saying that's him. But it could be, and she doesn't even know, because the two of them are both unable to communicate.",
            "No, they are saying that OOP is making her decision with not enough evidence. They are saying Redditors may or may not be right but the OOP was wrong to base her judgement on Redditors.

She decided that reddit knew him better than he knows himself, and without a real conversation, she's off towards the sunset. It's wild to make such a decision based on only hunches and reddit-affirmations.\n\nI agree that Redditors don\u2019t know anything and we don\u2019t know this people and shouldn\u2019t make wild assumptions. But saying that the OOP made her decision because she \u201cdecided that reddit knew him better than he knows himself\u201d IS an assumption. That her decision came purely because of Reddit and not other factors in their relationship that we\u2019re not seeing.",
            "Could be. But it could also be that OOP is reading her husband\u2019s actions correctly, because she knows him better than you, a random commenter. Do you not see the irony in making a comment about how OOP shouldn\u2019t assume Reddit knows her husband while also making the assumption that OOP must not know her own husband well enough to be able to read his action? \n\nMy point is that your comment that she \u201ctanked her own marriage because she trusted Reddit analysis\u201d IS an assumption, because you\u2019re assuming that OOP made her decision purely off Reddit and not what she knows about her own husband.",
            "What does that have to do with your original comment? Stop arguing on the internet. Leave me alone.",
            "Considering she came to reddit because she wasn't sure, I remain sceptical of how clearly she sees him. She wasn't sure in the first post. In the last, she seemed to have completely bought into the redditors' take. At least that's the impression I got from her words.\n\nRedditors seem certain, based on *her* retelling of her husband's actions and words (or lack thereof). And the further I read, the less certain I am of her reliability as a narrator. \n\nLike I have said in nearly every comment, her conclusion may well be the right one. I just see nothing to support such strong conviction. If she has more evidence to support her conviction, that's great, and I genuinely hope that she's making the right decision. It still leaves me baffled as to how so many redditors can feel so sure, because the things she shared do not have me convinced. I could easily see at least two alternative explanations, and I'm sure people with other life experiences could see others.\n\nOh well. I hope they both end up in a good place eventually. Whatever that place may be for either of them.",

I had no clue he was married when we first met and hooked up. I obviously looked him up on social media and while he did have photos of his kids on there, there was absolutely no mention or photos of a wife at all. I found out that he was married about a month after we first got together, but he told me it was just a marriage on paper and that they basically lived separate lives and agreed to remain married for practical purposes until the kids were older. They owned a business, which she really ran and he was just financially involved in.\n\nI knew at the time that I probably shouldn\u2019t believe him, but I convinced myself it was true. I was in my early 20s and so attracted to him and I guess almost infatuated with him. He made me feel so good. I know now that I should have ended it immediately, but I didn\u2019t realize what I was getting myself into. I was addicted to all of the attention he gave me, the great sex, the places he\u2019d take me. I felt special. I was so naive.\n\nI got pregnant about a year into seeing him. I had always been so careful with preventing pregnancy, but during my relationship with him I took stupid risks. I was so high in lust with this guy, it\u2019s embarrassing. The things he\u2019d asked me to do\u2026I\u2019d say yes to almost anything, even when I knew it was a bad idea.\n\nI was in love with him, or I thought I was. I hadn\u2019t intentionally wanted to get pregnant. I would of course dream about being his wife and having a family but I knew that wouldn\u2019t be a possibility while he had this arrangement with his actual wife. I didn\u2019t get pregnant on purpose with any intention of him leaving her for me, even if I wished that we could be a real, normal couple. I was surprised by how excited I was to be pregnant with his baby. I wanted that baby once I found out I was pregnant. The thought of carrying this baby of the man I loved was so special to me, but I knew he probably wouldn\u2019t feel the same.\n\nI told him I was pregnant and he told me I couldn\u2019t keep the baby. I expected his reaction, but I was devastated and it hurt me to my core that he didn\u2019t feel the same way I did. He offered to pay, to make a whole weekend of it somewhere exciting (wtf?) and to buy me something special if I\u2019d just please get rid of the baby. He explained that he didn\u2019t want any more kids and that he couldn\u2019t openly be a father to another kid when he and his wife were still pretending to be happily married to the outside world.\n\nI agreed to do what he wanted and we made plans for him to pick me up and find somewhere out of town to go get it done. I was all packed the night he was going to pick me up, but I started to feel really scared and really unsafe about the whole thing. I took my bag and checked myself into a hotel to hide because I couldn\u2019t go with him. I texted him to say I promised to never contact him again and to never name him as the father or go after child support if he\u2019d promise to leave me alone.\n\nAt first he tried to sweet talk me into doing what he wanted. When I didn\u2019t cave in, he said some very nasty things to me and that I essentially better never contact him again or show up at his door.\n\nI have a 2 year old now. At times, it\u2019s been difficult, but overall we are thriving as best we can. I have kept my word about not naming his as the father or requesting child support.\n\nHis wife contacted me on social media. Well, she\u2019s his ex-wife now. She wants to talk to me. She found out about me and told me that she divorced him 6 months ago. She wants her children to know their sibling and for my child to know his siblings. That\u2019s weird to me.\n\nI haven\u2019t responded back to her yet. I am unsure about how to approach this. How to I respond to this? I wonder if I\u2019m being selfish by not exploring an option for my child to know his siblings, if she\u2019s being genuine about that. If I was married and my husband fathered a child outside of our marriage I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel the same that she does.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n[Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/fFl8HyAjC7)\n> I didn\u2019t know he was married when we first got together. I acknowledged that I should have ended the relationship as soon as I found out he was married. I allowed myself to believe what he told me, which made it seem not so bad - like this was some sort of agreement he and his wife had. Emotionally, I was already hooked. I\u2019m not making excuses.\n> \n> I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201chappy\u201d to bring a baby into this situation. There was a huge mix of emotions. I felt like I was in love with him, so there was a part of me that was excited at first. That feeling soon died, but I felt that I loved my baby still. I tried to do the best thing that I could, which was to remove myself from his life and his family\u2019s life. I just wanted to be able to keep my baby and love my baby. I did not get pregnant on purpose. I wasn\u2019t on birth control. I had been on birth control when I was slightly younger and had a life threatening health complications as a result. He knew I wasn\u2019t on birth control. He loved unprotected sex. I was stupid and I agreed to do it. I would do almost anything he asked sexually. I tried to track my cycle and would tell him when it was probably not a safe time to do it.\n> \n> His wife isn\u2019t really what I\u2019m afraid of. Whatever she\u2019d want to say to me is probably deserved anyway, and more.\n\n[Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/3HyywLwJC6) \n> He found out about the pregnancy before I \u201cghosted\u201d him. And upon finding out I was pregnant with his child, there was absolutely no real discussion about what we were going to do. We were going to do what he wanted to do and he had it all planned out. He threatened me, by text and by phone calls and voicemails, when I told him I was not going to go with him on this abortion vacation he had planned. I begged him to please not force me to do that and he turned mean. I offered to never contact him again if he\u2019d just let me go. After threatening me again, about what he\u2019d do if I didn\u2019t keep my word, he agreed. He has kept his side of the bargain and has never contacted me.\n\n[Comment 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/GPNys9Lka9)\n> I\u2019ve been assuming that she found out about me in her own, maybe saw something on his phone or computer and has probably known for a while before reaching out to me (if it\u2019s actually her).\n> \n> I get what some people are saying about siblings and such, but that man is not my child\u2019s dad. He is the dad of his older kids but he\u2019s not the dad of my kid. I\u2019m still young and I hope to have more children one day, and those children would be my son\u2019s siblings. I hope to find a man who loves me and my son and with whom I can have a legitimate relationship. I haven\u2019t been with another man since I ended things with this guy. I actually just went on 2 dates for the first time very recently. I\u2019m not desperate to find a man right now, but I hope to find real love one day.\n> \n> Those people are not my son\u2019s family. He\u2019s 2 and they\u2019re old enough to drive. So, I do t think they\u2019re missing out on any sort of important relationship right now. I understand wanting to know your bio family, and I feel he can decide that later on when he\u2019s old enough to have a day. Depending on where we are at in our lives at the time, he might not feel a need to know those people.\n> \n> I don\u2019t plan to lie to my son about his conception, but I don\u2019t think we need to involve ourselves with the man\u2019s ex-wife and teenage children at this time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/VyvMrfZThh): **February 18, 2024**\n\nI made a post 3 weeks ago and things have only gotten stranger. I had an affair with a married man a few years ago. I regret it and I will never do anything like that ever again. I knew it was wrong from the very beginning, but he captivated me. I was naive. I allowed myself to believe when he told me they were pretty much just married on paper for the sake of their kids. I got pregnant and while he tried to talk me into getting an abortion I ultimately decided to keep the baby. I have a 2 year old little boy now. I promised this man that I wouldn\u2019t expose our affair and I wouldn\u2019t formally identify him as the father or request child support. I did that because he was becoming very nasty about the whole thing and I felt like due to the mess that I had created and the way I felt by the end of it, a clean break with no involvement with him would be the best thing for everyone. I moved back to where my family is, hundreds of miles from where he and his family live.\n\nAbout a month ago his ex-wife reached out to me via social media, claiming they had been divorced for 6 months and that she wanted our children to be able to know each other. Now, their kids are teenagers, so I didn\u2019t really think they\u2019d want anything to do with the toddler and the woman their father was having an affair with. It seemed odd to me. After posting here, I sort of decided that I wouldn\u2019t respond to her. I\u2019d just ignore it. She just sent me the one message, so it wasn\u2019t as if she was badgering me about talking to me or meeting me.\n\nOn Friday night I decided to message her. I don\u2019t really know why. I think it was really just for my sake so I could have the chance to apologize to her. I told her that I would be more comfortable speaking with her face to face since I couldn\u2019t trust that it was really her. She said she understood. I was too nervous to meet her in person, but we did a video chat. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, if this was all a ploy just to unleash her fury on me or what. I mean, I\u2019d deserve that. She wouldn\u2019t be wrong to feel that way.\n\nIt was really her. She told me she discovered our affair when she found communications between the two of us, after our relationship had ended. She told me I\u2019m one of many women he had affairs with over the years and she knew about somebody even before he met me, but she didn\u2019t divorce him at the time. Finding out about my child was the final straw for her. I told her I was sorry for my relationship with her husband and admitted that I knew he was married. She graciously told me she forgives me and that while she harbored a lot of anger towards me initially, she ultimately blames her husband. I\u2019m not blameless, but she chooses to not hate me, essentially. She said she couldn\u2019t have said this 6 months ago or a year ago when she first found out about me, but she has moved past that. She still has anger toward him, in addition to many other emotions surrounding him. She started pouring out her heart to me about their 20+ year marriage and life together and it was very awkward because what do I even say?\n\nHer kids know about me and my son. She says they\u2019re very mad at their father. Somehow I don\u2019t think they\u2019re mad about the fact that he\u2019s not involved with my son\u2019s life. And why would they be mad about that? I would hate me if I were them.\n\nI told her with my son being so little right now, I don\u2019t really feel comfortable with him meeting her kids or being involved with their family. I feel unsure about it and it\u2019s just not something I feel needs to happen right now.\n\nThen she told me her ex husband was in a bad accident 2 months ago. He\u2019s fine now, still not allowed to return to all his normal activities just yet, but will be fine. He is probably the most physically active person I\u2019ve ever met, barely ever seems to sit down, so he must be terribly annoying to be around if he\u2019s not allowed to go go go all the time. She told me he wants to meet my son. Apparently she moved back in with him temporarily when he first came home from the hospital. She said the accident really shook him up and he has been expressing a lot of regret about my son, not being involved, not providing for him.\n\nSo now it\u2019s like was everything she said just a lie and he somehow got her to reach out to me on his behalf? And she actually did it? It felt almost like a relief talking to her initially, but then it\u2019s like was any of that true or you were just trying to be his messenger? I don\u2019t even know if that part is true now. Why wouldn\u2019t he just contact me himself?\n\nI\u2019m just feeling so uneasy about the whole thing now.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n[Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/VaRxiwuOJZ)\n> I don\u2019t believe I HAVE to involve his teenage children in my son\u2019s life. Maybe when my son is old enough to decide if he wants that.\n> \n> He is not named on the birth certificate and I do not receive child support from him. I have asked nothing of him, except to let me move away and not try to force me to have an abortion. I basically had to promise him to not contact him, not make him as the father, not request child support.\n> \n> If he truly wants involvement with my son he can reach out to my directly and he can take the legal route to establish himself as our son\u2019s father.\n\n[Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/cW7PWl3vio)\n\n> He did not legally sever his rights. He never established rights in the first place. He has no rights until he goes to court and establishes himself as the father. He is welcome to do that.\n> \n> Honestly, I wish my son did have a father who was involved in his life and loved him. Yes, this guy has faults, but he has plenty of positive qualities. He is really involved with his older children. I met them many times because they\u2019d be at work with him or he\u2019d have to drop by the office in his way to take them somewhere. He was always doing things with them. They seemed like good kids who really loved their dad. I wish my son could have that experience too. I didn\u2019t think it was an option based on how he behaved when I was pregnant. He wasn\u2019t interested and wanted me and our baby to go away. That\u2019s what I did. And I accepted it.\n\n[Comment 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/XMFbjDscJ4)\n\n> He is not legally my son\u2019s father at this time. This means that currently he has no legal parental rights or responsibilities regarding my son. I cannot stop him from taking the legal steps to establish paternity if he wishes to do so.\n> \n> He will always be my son\u2019s biological father. I can\u2019t change that fact. Regardless of whether or not he ever legally establishes paternity, my son will likely be curious about his biological father and who knows, maybe they will establish a relationship one day regardless of legal paternity.\n> \n> There is no way to say if I will meet a man who may want to adopt my son one day, thus becoming his legal father. It\u2019s something that I think would be nice, but nothing that I\u2019m \u201cintent\u201d on doing. By choice, I\u2019ve only been one 2 dates since my son was born and that was only within the year 2024. I realize that it will not be as simple as signing a piece of paper.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n[Update #2](https://redd.it/1cgl0wt): **April 30, 2024 (2 months later)**\n\nI posted about this few months ago.\n\nTo summarize very quickly, when I was fresh out of college I had an affair with a married man and father. I became pregnant. He wanted me to get an abortion. He had arranged to \u201ctake me away\u201d in a \u201cvacation\u201d to get an abortion. I wasn\u2019t really sure what I wanted to do but I agreed to go along with what we wanted. At the last minute, when he was on his way to come pick me up, I told him I couldn\u2019t go through with the abortion. I just really didn\u2019t feel comfortable about his plan and how he was orchestrating everything. It scared me. I realized at that time how deep I had gone with this mistake, how screwed up the whole relationship was.\n\nHe was really mad. He threatened me, said a lot of nasty things to me. I told him if he just left me alone and let me have my baby then I\u2019d leave him alone and wouldn\u2019t name him as the father or seek child support. I moved back home (I was living in a different state when I met him). I kept my word and I did t it name him as the father or seek to establish paternity. I have never sought child support. My child is 2 now.\n\nA few months ago his wife contacted me via social media. At first she made it seem like she wanted my child to have the opportunity to know his siblings. It was sort of weird since the siblings are teenagers. She said she had divorced him 6 months prior.\n\nI agreed to talk to her virtually, not in person. I felt that I owed it to her to apologize for what I had done. I do feel bad about it. But at the end of the conversation I told her that I didn\u2019t feel it was the appropriate time to connect my son with her kids. He\u2019s a toddler and their teens, plus I had promised her husband to stay out of his life. That\u2019s when she told me that he was recently in a bad accident and she had been helping to take care of him. Supposedly he was going to be fine and was fairly recovered at that point, but she said he had expressed interest to meet our child. So she was basically his messenger.\n\nI have not been in contact with her since then. I deleted my social media. I don\u2019t know why, but the whole thing just really made me uncomfortable.\n\nSince I last posted here\u2026.\n\nThen, I received a handwritten letter from him. In it, he expressed how he wanted to get to know our son, he wants to be a father to our son, he wants to provide financially for him, he\u2019d like us to come visit him. He asked me to sign a paternity affidavit. I refused to do so. I know he is my son\u2019s father but I\u2019m not going to make this that easy for him. After the things he said to me and threatened me with, he at least has to work for this.\n\nAt that point, my parents felt that we needed to meet with a lawyer. All communication from me has gone through a lawyer. I have never responded to him personally/directly.\n\nNow, I have a court order for paternity. I have to present my son to have a specimen taken tomorrow. I already know what it\u2019s going to say.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want my son to have a dad in his life. It\u2019s just\u2026the whole situation is a mess. And he lives a few states away from me. I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t really do anything. He\u2019s doing things legally. Next, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll petition for some form of custody or visitation. He\u2019s not married anymore, supposedly, but he\u2019s a lot more established than I am. He has considerably more financial resources. I also know he has all sorts of connections where he lives. Luckily they don\u2019t hold as much weight here in my state but it\u2019s still so scary to me.\n\nI\u2019m a bad mom. I brought my son into this world knowing it was a messy situation. I just got so comfortable with it just being the 2 of us and now I don\u2019t want to give that up.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on if the father would be moving closer to her and her son now that he\u2019s divorced from his ex-wife**\n\n> **OOP:** To touch on just a few things\u2026\n> \n> I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll move away from where he lives. He has way too much established there.\n> \n> He\u2019s in his early 40s. I don\u2019t know how this supposed accident (if that even really happened) has affected him, but he was incredibly physically active when I knew him. He only slept like 4 hours a night, took a 20 minute power nap daily, and rarely ever sat down. He was also HIGHLY involved in his children\u2019s lives. I\u2019d even say overprotective, like a helicopter dad instead of the typical helicopter mom.\n\n**Careless_Welder_4048:** How did he have time to cheat?\n> **OOP:** He only slept a few hours a night and moved at about a million miles a minute. Everyone joked about it. Somehow he always had time to get up at 5 am, go surfing, do some work, take his kids to school, do some work, take his Power Nap, get coffee, pick his kids up after school and take them wakeboarding or some other sort of thing like that, do some more work, be at his kid\u2019s basketball game, and so on and so forth. He literally never ever stopped.\n> \n> I was just another thing to help fill out his calendar to prevent him from getting bored.\n\n**OOP on the father\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife and their children**\n\n> **OOP:** I also don\u2019t think he and his wife had much of a relationship, although it wasn\u2019t quite as he described it to me. They lived in the same house but I believe they lived pretty separate lives. He bought her a business to give her something to do and keep her busy. She was there most of the time. They didn\u2019t even go to their kids activities together. He was always the one going. So I think that freed up time too. I don\u2019t think they liked being around each other so she was happy to have him out of the house. She admitted to me that I wasn\u2019t the first affair he had and she knew about most of the time we were together.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---------------------------------\n\n# ----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Another update on how stupid I am, or I had a baby as a result of an affair and now his wife is reaching out to me](https://redd.it/1dga5xi): **June 15, 2024 (2 months later)**\n\nI won\u2019t rehash the whole thing here. My previous posts are on my profile. I got pregnant from an affair with a married guy. He wanted me to have an abortion. I decided I didn\u2019t want one. He turned mean, I promised to not name him as the father, legally, or to pursue any sort of child support. I moved away from where he and his family were located. I\u2019m about 12 hours away from him now, back where my family is from. I haven\u2019t reached out to him in the now over 3 years since.\n\nHis ex-wife reached out to me out of the blue via social media, initially claiming she wanted to connect with me so that our kids could know each other. When I politely declined for the time being, as her kids are teenagers and my son is a toddler and we live states apart, she revealed she was really reaching out in behalf of her ex-husband who had supposedly had a change of heart about being involved in our child\u2019s life after nearly dying in an accident. I did not engage with her any further after that. It all made me feel very uncomfortable.\n\nLater, I received a letter from him in the mail. He asked to be involved with our son, to provide for him, etc. It still felt weird. I mean he turned really mean and didn\u2019t want anything to do with me or our baby and hadn\u2019t made any attempt to contact me in years (and I was not hiding - his wife was obviously able to find me on social media and you can find my address online).\n\nI felt like if he was serious, he\u2019d take the steps to establish paternity legally. And that\u2019s what he did. Around 1.5 months ago we were ordered to submit DNA samples for a paternity test. It took around 5 weeks to find out what I already knew it\u2019d say. But now things are stalled for another several weeks for the next step in the court process.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked to him at all during this whole thing. I didn\u2019t respond directly to his letter. I do have a lawyer and everything is basically going through him now.\n\nThen without any warning, he just showed up at my home last weekend. Just knocked on the door like it was nothing. Basically, this is his son and he doesn\u2019t want to wait another 6 weeks for the court to inevitably order us into some sort of custody mediation anyway\u2026his words. Why can\u2019t I just talk to him? I told him he made me uncomfortable and him just showing up at my house really made me uncomfortable. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what made me so uncomfortable. The fact that he showed up unannounced like that or the fact that I instantly felt the same attraction to him that I had when I was with him and I didn\u2019t want to feel that at all. In some weird way part of me felt happy to see him and then another part of me was disgusted that I was happy.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just talk about this. He\u2019s not trying to take my son away from me; he just wants to be involved in his life and to help provide for him like he should have been all along. He\u2019s sorry he wasn\u2019t there when he was born. He\u2019s sorry he reacted the way that he did when I didn\u2019t go along with his plans to take me on an abortion vacation. Why can\u2019t I believe that he just wants to be a dad to his kid?\n\nI guess I agree with him. Why can\u2019t I just accept that he has had a change of heart? I can\u2019t trust myself. I can\u2019t trust my own judgment. I feel like if I easily let him into my son\u2019s life I\u2019m going to end up regretting it and be made a fool of somehow. I\u2019ve already made so many mistakes when it comes to him.\n\nHe says it\u2019s stupid of me to not try to work it out amongst ourselves first. I\u2019m giving so much control to the court. I don\u2019t know whether to believe that or to think it\u2019s just his way of convincing me to do what he wants.\n\nI know he will get some sort of visitation and eventual custody. Maybe it would be better if we try to come to an agreement, but he had the ability to sway me so easily. I\u2019m so stupid when it comes to him. Nobody else has ever made me feel so foolish in my life.\n\nI want my son to have a dad. I admit it\u2019s probably selfish of me to want to keep him away. I just keep imagining having to spend weeks or months apart from my child while he\u2019s living with his dad 12 hours away and I can\u2019t stand the thought of it.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling sad, stupid, and defeated.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on if the father is actually divorced from his wife**\n\n> **OOP:** I checked the county records and they did actually get divorced.\n\n**Mammoth_Might8171:** At this point, u need to trust your lawyer (hopefully he is a good one). Make sure that your lawyer has all the facts, including how poorly he treated u when he found out u were pregnant. Do not communicate anymore with your ex, especially since u know that u are incapable of making good decisions when he is involved. U may need to prepare yourself mentally that your ex is eventually going to play a role in your kid\u2019s life (as much as that suck). Hopefully u can go after him for back-child support\n\n> **OOP:** My lawyer has any and all information that I possibly had to share.\n> \n> I am already preparing myself that he will likely have a role in my child\u2019s life. I mean, the change will be difficult for me and I honestly don\u2019t want anything to change. But I\u2019m trying to focus on any shred of positive outcome this could have for my son. He deserves a dad. I wish it wasn\u2019t in this situation. I wish I had given him two loving parents in a stable relationship, the ideal. I wish I had at least given him a father who didn\u2019t live states away. I feel bad that my son has two lying cheaters for parents. I truly do feel so embarrassed about our behavior in a new way I did before, ever since my son was born. Other than that whole thing and the fact that he\u2019s apparently had affairs with multiple women according to his ex-wife, he actually seems like a good dad to his teenage kids. He was always very involved with them. I guess I\u2019m just trying to cling to whatever positive things I can think of. He can also provide a lot more financially than I currently can. Thats scary for me because I\u2019m already turning it into some sort of competition between us in my head. Several points for him, none for me.\n> +\n> My son is also very shy. He doesn\u2019t do well if me or one of my parents isn\u2019t there with him. I\u2019m just now getting him involved in more activities with other kids and safe, trusted adults, but he still just clings to me. My heart breaks when I think of him meeting a strange man he doesn\u2019t know and me not being there. I want to be there.\n> + \n> I think that\u2019s how things normally go for him and to be perfectly honest that\u2019s how I used to be for him to. Just go along with what he wants. He was obviously expecting me to when he showed up in person. He genuinely seemed surprised I didn\u2019t cave in to his requests right on the spot. The previous version of me probably would have.\n\n**OOP on how the father managed to find her address** \n\n> **OOP:** He sent me a letter in the mail previously. I Googled myself and my address comes up easily. Admittedly, I made no effort to hide myself after moving away. I didn\u2019t think I needed to. He had no interest in being involved with our baby and I promised to never contact him again, so I thought that was the end of it.\n> \n> His ex-wife told me he was in a bad accident when I talked to her. It\u2019s not too surprising based on his hobbies. He lives at like 200 miles per minute. According to her, she had to move back into their house to take care of him while he recovered. When he showed up here, he didn\u2019t look like somebody who had been in a life threatening accident not too terribly long ago. He told me he\u2019s fully recovered and although he\u2019ll probably have back issues the rest of his life he\u2019s perfectly fine.\n\n**OOP on having a visitation plan with the father for her son**\n\n> **OOP:** My lawyer says that other than creating a graduated visitation plan based on the fact that my son doesn\u2019t know this man, the fact that he hasn\u2019t been involved in his child\u2019s life for the last 3 years won\u2019t mean much to the court. Their ultimate goal is for a child to have 2 parents. I screwed myself over by not naming him as the father at birth or trying to establish paternity in any way. Had I done that and he fought it, neglected to pay court ordered child support, etc., then we could have a better case as far as abandonment goes. He is putting in the effort to establish paternity now, is willing to pay child support (so he says), and is presumably going to tell the court he wants to see his kid and this is going to reflect positively for him, despite not being involved for 3 years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

Exwife told OOP that AP has had multiple affairs. And none of that made her want to divorce him.\u00a0\n\n\nThe abandonment of a child did though.\u00a0\n\n\nThat 3yo boy is the catalyst that led to AP losing control of damn near everything in his life. Starting with OOP openly defying him by refusing the abortion and ghosting him. His threats to her is an attempt to gain control of something he could no longer direct by ensuring it is removed from his circle of influence, where his shame can impact him.\u00a0\n\n\nBut then his wife finds out. And he learns that there is a line that leads her to choose divorce. He loses his children's respect. And with living proof of his infidelity and his callousness, his reputation probably takes a hit as well.\u00a0\n\n\nThen the accident happens. And it gives him a lot of time and space to think.\u00a0\n\n\nHe can't unfuck the cat now that it's out of the bag. But, he can rehabilitate his image as a loving family man and a good person with his circle by embracing the boy, make it a redemption journey. Maybe even win back his family.\u00a0\n\n\nHe starts feeding that story to his ex wife and she takes the bait by playing on her love for children to contact OOP on his behalf.\u00a0\n\n\nThe wrench remains OOP. Turns out she's not in as dire straits as he had hoped a single mom and didn't jump at the chance to 'give her son a dad.' He tries again, and is probably shocked when she lawyers up. It slows his roll considerably.\u00a0\n\n\nHis showing up in person at her place is his impatience showing, his mask slipping at her resistance to what he wants. He needs her cooperation. Not just to speed up his plans, but to also bend her into a situation the benefits him. His visit is also to try and gather intel on how to do that.\u00a0\n\n\nAs it were, once child support is established, he's probably planning on overpaying the court ordered amount for back pay and future payments. He's also reading a lot of books on child psychology prepping for supervised visitation to put his best foot forward.

Do it under the stance of revisit it in 6-12 months, have child see a therapist etc.",

Dude got pissed off she wouldn't get an abortion, threatened her, took off, and wasn't part of his son's life in any capacity for years. Most family court judges aren't going to be happy about that. And assuming the guy himself has lawyered up, he's been told this.\n\nHence showing up on her doorstep to get her to handle this outside of the courts.

She still knew it was wrong and is partially at fault, but let's not pretend this guy isn't a predator who targeted a young and insecure woman on purpose.

OOP needs to gear her strategy towards not giving more before it\u2019s reasonable/keeping her own communication with him strictly child-related. She\u2019s still mourning her old normal/what should have been and not seeing realistic ways to protect herself.

            "Lmao what? In Ontario it's 100% online now. You get a little slip of paper with a code on it, then you enter that into the service Ontario website. You just need both parents SIN, that's it. There's no signing, no verification, it was absurd how easily I could have lied while filling it out. It did \"prompt\" me by saying \"please pass the screen to the secondary parent to fill out this information\", which I didn't, I just did it myself. The information was your basic government info + SIN. That's about it. I didn't sign anything, I didn't see anyone. I filled it all out while I was on the toilet trying not to cry while pooping.",
            "Yeah but she heavily lacks empathy for anyone other than herself? Her actions (whether or not she\u2019s naive) broke up a family and her response is feeling uncomfortable hearing about how difficult it is for them? You\u2019re uncomfortable hearing about how your ongoing affair and pregnancy ruined their entire family dynamic? Wow how awful! That single phone call must have been so difficult for the poor girl! Yes he\u2019s a total pos but she\u2019s a total waste of a human too. Play stupid games and win stupid prizes. She\u2019ll be sleeping with him again in no time.",
            "Happy cake day \ud83c\udf82\n\nIt should count but didn't go in my favour. In the last decade there have been multiple times my daughter has experienced harm because of his actions but each time it falls short of police or social work taking action beyond speaking to him. Thankfully she's getting older and is starting to see the kind of man he really is.",
            "I mean, obviously she's not the type of person to question whatever thing pops I to her head initially, no matter how dumb it is. At least not until long after it would benefit her. Asking people's advice requires a person to question themselves. \n\nSounds like she hasn't said anything because it hasn't occurred to her to do so. So they're probably none the wiser. She'll most likely mention it casually one day in the future and only luck will determine whether or not it happens in time for it to matter.",
            "Yeah but pulling up the past texts and showing the threats/coercion will poke a LOT of holes in that shit. Can't really have a baby in secret if the dad was trying to force you to have an abortion.",
            "True. It'd be easy to prove that he wanted her to have an abortion and wanted nothing to do with the kid so it wasn't done in secret so much as she feared for the safety of her unborn kid through text messages to show he wanted nothing to do with the child and not including his name was done because of that. Even if she didn't keep any of the text messages or emails between them, she should still have the communication the ex wife sent where she talks about \"husband has come around\". His lawyer could say he had no knowledge of this, but that'd easily be disproven.\n\nHowever...OOP seems like the kind of person that would get overwhelmed and not even think of that. She comes to reddit for even the most basic questions regarding this guy and her kid. She'd need a quality lawyer to watch out for her and he can just spin it as \"You'll just spend a lot of money you don't have to end up at the same position you would if we just handled it ourselves.",
            "The lawyer wouldn\u2019t have spin anything. That is exactly what she has done. She is not only making things difficult for herself but for her child.  She has no leg to stand on and she know it. She isn\u2019t 12 she is over twenty and is suffering the consequences of her actions. The only sad thing is so is this innocent child.",
            "Personally! I think it's better eff off, permanently if possible. I have no doubt he will make hers and the child's life chaotic and unstable if he stays.",
            "Yep, the state I filed in the statistics actually favored the Dad 54% of the fathers won to 46% of Moms.  When I asked my attny they said there had been a recent movement bringing attention to the vast unfairness and disproportionate courts ruling in the Mothers favor and in effort to be unbiased , the courts had  been OVER - compensating.  Attny said they also take into consideration who makes the most money, in most cases it's the Dad.",
            "Wait seriously. My kid is 17 and I had her in SK so it\u2019s been a bit. But genuinely this is one of those things that likely should have never gone digital ever. It\u2019s just way too damn easy to fuck up someone\u2019s life without proof. Like I had to do mine at the hospital with a nurse to witness my signature on it. No father so not for her, but the women I shared a room with they witnessed both signatures.",
            "I think OOP said she doesn't have those texts anymore and some info was a phone call.",
            "Did you purposely ignore the part where he tries to coerce and threaten her into having an abortion, which she had text message proof of? And having to tell him she will never contact him again or chase after child support if he just leaves her alone because she didn't feel safe, which she also had text message proof of?",
            "He wanted to, if we go by the pro life route, kill this kid. She didn't keep him from him, he wanted to get rid of it and threatened her. She's dumb as a rock but at least she was smart enough to have that as evidence",
            "Oh yah, 100% digital now. Didn't even get a phonecall lol. I did have my kid during the pandemic so healthcare was strapped. But the \"portal\" had been operational before that. You fill out the birth registration, birth certificate and health card all at once and call it \"convenient\". \n\nI'm pretty sure there was even an option to click if you didn't have the SIN available. So I totally could have just put anyone down and said I didn't know the SIN. Maybe. I was recovering from a csection and loopy from a fresh new baby. But I remember thinking \"Well this is going to get taken advantage of by garbage humans\"",
            "Of course this woman wasn't smart enough to save literal threats made to her only 2 years ago by the father of her child. Of course. *sighs deeply*"
