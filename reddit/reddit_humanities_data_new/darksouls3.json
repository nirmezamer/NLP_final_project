I\u2019m unsure if DS3 has a respec mechanic like ER, and I don\u2019t want to make a bad build if any stats are less/more important in DS3 than ER. For example, I\u2019ve heard that vigor was more important in ER then previous games, so should I invest more into offensive stats?",

Obviously bloodborne was more agressive, and elden ring was a open world game that was a tiny bit more forgiving, how would you describe DS3 ? I also played a bit of sekiro but am not counting it here since i didn't finish it, not cuase i didn't want to, but becuase my friend who was lending me his account to play it, got banned and i no longer has acsses to his library of games\n\nFollow up question: The elite knight set was the set i used for my entire run of dark souls remastered can i get it here too ? And if not how do i get the armor on the cover, it looks just as badass ?\n\nLast question: i've never beed into magic, what swords/greatswords, would you reccomend ?\n\nI currently beat gundyr and am at firelink shrine",

Not only that this game theme deals heavily on the old age dying out and trying to haphazardly keep it alive, so seeing dead NPC creatures or broken buildings is an extension to that idea.\n\nIDK i want discussion so go nuts ps the Dylan Sucks 3 is just a dumb joke...",

Also, not sure if my original post broke any rules since it was a recording (see rule 9), but I saw a similar post earlier so I had thought it was allowed. Might as well ask a question while I'm here. Any tips on dealing with Sister Friede on SL1? I lost my original SL1 run save, so I have to do this again, and remember I was struggling with her last time. I even beat Nameless King, but not her. So, any tips?",
            "I'm lost. \n\nQuestion 1\n\nI am generally okay with open games, which there are several different paths that can change the course of your play, but in this game, I just can't get used to it. \n\nShould I just stop worrying about discovering everything, and leave things for my next run?\n\nQuestion 2\n\nI don't really struggle with bosses. \nNormally takes 3 to 4 tries to get the boss and continue the game. \nWhat's being an issue is the trash mobs in the areas that I somehow just can't get used to their movements and positions. \nI really enjoy fighting the bosses, but whenever I finish a boss, my enjoyment plummets cuz I have to waddle through places that I don't know where is what enemies, with bonfires that are hard to find in a streamlined matter (Sekiro did way better job with Statues I guess) and I just don't feel like I'm getting better at all, cuz all it takes is some mob in between bosses to kill me over and over. What should I do?",
            "(Didn\u2019t have the karma for this as a thread so copy-paste\u2026)\n\nI\u2019m looking to make a build just to play differently and do something weird. I can\u2019t re-find the video to save my life, but I was inspired by a PvP build that used a right-handed shield and left-handed weapon, trading into all attacks with the \u201ckick\u201d push. \n\nI was thinking of recreating this as a Raw gouge build (trading with the push takes a ton of stamina and missing the input means eating an attack), using the Pierce Shield for more oomph and maybe a axe or hammer\u2026 something that could do good Raw-infused after they stagger from the bash so I don\u2019t have to invest in the usual STR/DEX. If it needs only 10 STR (same as the shield) that\u2019s even better.\n\nAny suggestions for making this more viable? The shield choice, offhand weapon, rings, buffs\u2026? Heck, I\u2019ll just take general thoughts.",

            "It took me more than 1 week to finish the game, didn't expect to finish it this fast but there are days I would go from Pontiff all the way to Dragonslayer Armor.\n\nIn Elden Ring I was using a Dex build (Bloodhound Fang/Morgott's Cursed Sword) so this time I tried Strength build. Eventually I found out Gut's sword/Yhorm's is as fun as swinging Great Club around. So effective to one-shot mobs or stagger them to death.\n\nBiggest struggle I had in the game was probably Pontiff and Dancer. Otherwises I can say most of the bosses are very fair to play (and easier than I expected). Twin Princes is awesome, Soul of Cinder is badass and Nameless King is flashy (at 40 vigor and 14 flasks +10 it's too damn hard to be killed).\n\nI think I prefer the way the level design in DS3 than in ER (just like \n in Sekiro where ). It's nicer to run around and find out I made a shortcut to the original bonfire and it all connects together.\n\nOn my way to clear the DLC, and hopefully will play DS1/DS2 after this",

            "Ok so maybe I've gone a bit psychotic from this fucking horrendous farm but I'm pretty sure the stairs themselves on the stairs to anor londo play a part in the droprate for the proof of concord kept from the silver knights. I just spent 95 minutes farming the two silver knights on the stairs to anor londo and what I always do is lure out the spear guy and kill him first then go for the swordsman. I did this for 96 minutes and got ONE single proof and it was at the top of the stairs from the second guy. Then I tried maybe lowering my item discovery to 200 and doing it only at the top of the stairs. I did this after 17 times got another proof of concord kept. Then I tried it again with 500 item discovery and indeed the drop rate went up to about one proof of concord kept every 7 runs, with me getting two of them per run twice. So 100 minutes later I had 12 more proof of concord kepts. Now I tried farming again luring the spear knight down out of the stairs and again I spent more than 20 runs with no proof of concord kept before giving up. So by this I'm thinking maybe theres some sort of bug with the area itself that affects the drop rate depending on where you are? Or maybe i've just gone insane? also will using cheatengine offline to spawn these fucking items get me banned or is it like in DS2?? ((just asking teehee teehee teehe god fucking help me.)",

            "Parrying in Dark Souls is a little less straight forward than in Bloodborne. Aside from some guns firing quicker than others, its always the same thing mechanically. You shoot them as they swing at you and they get parried. In Dark Souls, the timing has to be mostly perfect. I cant really give you a tip on when to parry, because for me, it eventually just became a feeling. You just \"get it\" eventually. Things that definitely help tho is, for example, to under no circumstances using a medium shield to parry. Different shields and other left handed weapons have different parry frames and animations. Medium shields are the absolute worst, and should not be parried with, unless your goal is just flexing. The best thing to use for parrying are fist weapons, such as caestus, they got a quick animation and quite a few parry frames. Other than that, there are also small shields, with obvious choices, such as the small leather shield or the target shield, which actually have a special parry animation, but I'd actually advise against using shields that have that animation. It just takes unnecessarily long, giving you less time to go for the riposte. Instead, use a small shield such as the iron round shield or the llewellyn shield, which is more easily accessible, due to not having to be farmed for. They got quite a bit of parry frames and also have a quick animation.\n\nHere is a really good video on parrying: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdBwOG27yA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdBwOG27yA)\n\n  \nAs for poise, this has been a mechanic since Dark Souls 1. What it basically does is allow you to shrug off attacks. They will still deal the normal amount of damage, but you will not get staggered. In Dark Souls 1, this was absolutely stupid. You could trivialize that entire game by simply wearing heavy armor. In Dark Souls 2, poise was nerfed a little, but worked more or less the same. In Dark Souls 3, they did the only right thing, and pretty much chucked poise as it was out the window. Poise is still a stat that armor gives you, but it works significantly different now. Together with DS3 poise came a new system called hyper armor. Hyper armor works like poise from the other 2 Dark Souls games, except it only activates when you are swinging your weapon, and different weapons have more or less poise health than others. Poise health is an invisible bar that weapons have. Your poise stat determines how much that bar is filled. Generally, the bigger the weapon, the bigger the poise health. Daggers, straight swords, curved swords, katanas, fist weapons, spears, rapiers, whips, scythes, and axes have no hyper armor, at least not on their R1's or R2's. Hammers, halberds, and greatswords have hyper armor when wielded with 2 hands. Curved greatswords, ultra greatswords, greataxes and greathammers always have poise. The amount increases when wielded with 2 hands, but you always have some. Greathammers have the most out of all the weapon types. Generally, if you care about poise, you should stay between 30 and 40 poise for it to be effective. But since most weapons just straight up do not have hyper armor, you can also just wear whatever you want. Also poise breaks are simple. If you run out of poise health, your poise will break, which causes you to stagger. Your poise health will automatically reset back to 100% after 30 seconds, but some weapon arts allow you to recharge it immediately. Perseverance on caestus resets your poise health, and so do all stomp weapon arts.",

            "The nameless kings first phase is weak to lightning, and his second phase is weak to fire and dark. So before respeccing your entire character, switch to the broadsword, which has a stat requirement of 10 in strength and dex, and is therefore perfectly usable by your character. Infuse it with a raw gem, upgrade it to the highest level that you can, buy a bunch of gold pine and charcoal pine bundles from the shrine handmaid, and then try to fight the nameless king again. Gold pine bundles add 120 lightning damage for 10 seconds. Charcoal pine bundles add 110 fire damage for 10 seconds. You can apply them while sprinting, so just apply them every time before attacking.\n\nOtherwise, if you really wanna respec to pyromancy, here is a build: [https://soulsplanner.com/darksouls3/163167](https://soulsplanner.com/darksouls3/163167)\n\nIncrease or decrease strength and dex depending on what weapon or weapons you intend to use. Infuse with either chaos or dark. Or raw, if you intend to buff your weapon using carthus flame arc. If you want other pyromancies, another 2 good ones for PVE are chaos bed vestiges and black fire orb. What armor you use doesn't really matter, but I'd recommend not wasting too many points into vitality. Since you started with knight, this build would require you to be at least level 97, instead of 90, but it works just the same. Its just a little less minmaxed.\n\nAlso a good place to farm souls at, is before the stairs that lead to the twin princes. When you walk outside the building with the elevator and look directly at the stairs, when you go sharp left, there is a path up to the roof. On that roof are a bunch of gold winged knights.

But ring of favor, havels ring and prisoners chain are pretty much mandatory for this setup. I have gold pine bundles on this build, simply because they are an easy source of an extra 120 lightning damage, without having to spec into any stats to achieve said lightning damage. They only last for 10 seconds tho, and while you can apply them even while sprinting, if you are lazy, you can just use gold pine resin instead. Thats 95 lightning damage for a minute. Blessed caestus is there primarily just to give you some passive HP regen, but it isn't necessary. Its also a good parry tool tho, and it has the best weapon art in the game, perseverance.",

            "Unfortunately, there isn't really anything naturally dex/faith (saints bi-dent comes to mind though). It will require you to lighting or bless infuse whatever you're using. If you truly want to get the most out of those stats and you plan to have more faith in the future, you'll want to use sunlight/darkmoon blade with the lingering dragon crest ring. The more faith you have the more of a damage buff you'll get from those spells. A buffed weapon with those spells will always do more damage than just a lightning or blessed infused weapon. \n\nAs for the sellsword twinblades, speed runners use them because they scale well on a single stat for being a starting weapon and can carry the game. If you every watch those runs, they use a lot of resins to apply buffs or status effects that the specific bosses are weak to. Personally not my favorites either though. \n\n  \nSide note, I'd also suggest swapping your vigor and endurance. You don't really need that much stamina with dex weapons. 20 max is usually conservative and I'd shoot for 35 vigor (usually using the prisoners chain to hit that).",

            "I wouldn't really call any of the base game spells or weapons super unique in DS3. If you want the wild stuff you'll want the dlcs but you'll most likely get all that stuff post end game unless you beat the ashes dlc early... That's where most of the gimmick stuff is.\n\nHere's my default build list:\n\nFor casting, the most fun I've had was tied to pyros using chaos bed vestiges (early-mid-game) and then transferring to the Izalith staff and using dark sorceries once I got the DLC spells (45-45 int-fth). There are a lot of pyro spells early that carry. \n\nSorceries are fine but are pretty basic in terms of repeating stuff from the previous games. Faith is just really weak in DS3 compared to previous iterations. \n\nPure strength build are ultras so the greatsword (early), lothric knight greatsword (late) and Vorts great hammer (first boss weapon) are my favorites. Usually use all three at some point. \n\nPure dex just sorta ends up being katanas (uchi is in firelink) with the exception being the best longsword in the game, lothric knight sword (first area farmed) being an S scaling dex infused weapon. The starting twin blades are really good too but I prefer the added bleed status effects of the katanas. \n\nYou'll eventually end up with the frayed blade if you run the DLC as a dex charater but that requires you to defeat arguably one of the hardest bosses in the series. \n\nQuality would be a good option as well if you want to just try everything. 40-40 str-dex basically lets you play with everything and you can scale the regular weapons as you please. Ultra and regular curve swords (plenty of options early) shine here along with alot of the greatswords like the claymore (first level) and executioners sword (early game). Then of course Gaels greatsword after beating the ring city is awesome.",

Too stressful, felt like I was constantly being punished and could only succeed through cheesing or blind luck. Some time later I came back, and tried switching up my playstyle. Instead of using longsword + shield, I tried using the Vordt's Great Hammer. The extra range and stagger damage changed the game for me, and carried me to the end.",

OP was proud enough to post about it after all,as they should be. If anything I think using weapons that are a little unbalanced reduce the worth of the achievement by the same amount said used tissue paper would: barely at all.\n\nYour reactions suggest that you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about or what the souls games are about. You\u2019re just trying to superficially look good for clout.",
            "If they were unbalanced they\u2019d get nerfed like the OP weapons and summons in ER did, also if you think the difference between beating him in 1 attempt with any weapon compared to twinblades is barely at all then why\u2019d you try use them to dismiss the achievement? \n\nI know exactly what I\u2019m talking about because I see it way more than I should, seems like you hate the idea other people can do well in these games because it makes you look less special. You\u2019re trying to save face because you know what I\u2019m saying at least has a bit of truth to it. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "I don\u2019t care at all about how well someone else might do in these games, aside from being happy that they\u2019re doing well. I hope next time they can conquer an even harder task, like beating Midir in one attempt with a less optimal build. I\u2019m hardly trying to dismiss the achievement, I\u2019m trying to encourage them to strive higher, albeit it seems not very well.\n\nIm not special at all for beating Midir or any tough souls boss, nor did I claim to be.\n\nFromsoft grows with each installment and maybe they missed these twinblades or some of the other weapons that dwarf a lot of the others. In Elden Ring they were more thorough.\n\nWhen I said that you didn\u2019t know what you were talking about, I was talking about conquering a challenge in a souls game, not dismissing achievements, being transactionally virtuous and taking things out of context.  Anyone can do the latter. The former requires someone to actually play a Souls game(which anyone can do if they want to.) It seems you\u2019re more interested in social media than souls games though, thus my doubt as to whether you played the games or not.\n\nThe well earned satisfaction and pride that comes from beating a souls boss is something that can only be experienced first hand, which you\u2019d understand if you played the games. I have even less reason to believe that you have now than earlier. Midir is one of the hardest bosses in the series, and beating in one try, even with a broken weapon is an achievement to be proud of. This is also something you\u2019d have to play the game to truly know.\n\nI admittedly had to use a broken weapon my first time beating Midir and several other fights in the series. Over time, I grew past the need for that and even started handicapping myself in those fights for fun. I would like to see this person grow as well, as I would with any person playing these games.\n\nThus far, you have misread my intentions, albeit accidentally. I hope this clears things up. If you continue with the line of thought that you started this little chat with, I will know that you misread it maliciously, and have/will do it much more. In that case, this chat is over, permanently.",
