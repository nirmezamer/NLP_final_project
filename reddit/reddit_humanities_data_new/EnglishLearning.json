It's not just used for work at a job, but anything that is tiring and feels like a job or chore.

To make a prediction of an outcome, as in your sports example -- \"I'm calling it now; my team's gonna win\"\n\n3. To make a claim on something -- \"I call the front seat!\"",

            "My best guess from that context is that she's referring to the other character's \"line\" in the sense of her familial line, as in her mother, father's grandfather, etc. \n\nIt seems like she's talking about how the fact that the other character is using her stillborn brother and mother who died in childbirth are being used to guilt her into agreeing to something. \n\nThat would explain why \"to know a great line\" in the sense that you are talking about doesn't make sense \n\nMore context: \"a great line\" is also often used to refer to a family of influence or importance. This would agree with the rest of what I just said as well."

            "Both mean the same thing and but *died* is focused on the act of dying (the verb), whereas *dead* focuses on their current state (adjective). \n\nHe has died therefore he is dead.",
            "\"He has died\" sounds like you're breaking the recent news to someone.",
            "\"He has died.\" is present perfect tense, so you're communicating that his death has occurred, recently. The present perfect is a \"reporting the news\" tense. Someone in 1865 might have said \"Abe Lincoln has died\", but it would be weird for us to say that. \"He is dead.\" simply says that someone is no longer alive, nothing about when he might have died. You could say \"He's dead (Jim).\" right after someone dies, or long after their death. \"Abe Lincoln is dead.\"",
            "If you're referring to the person, \"he is dead\" focuses on them while \"he has died\" focuses on the death. One is describing someone while the other is used to inform someone of a death.",
            "The same can be used with other, happier, states of being. \n\nHe is married - you have no chance\n\nHe got married - this happened recently or at a point in time in the sentence.  'He got married' means that this is news.  It just happened.  Or 'He got married in 1978' tells you the same, except that it happened almost 50 years ago.\n\nHe is married is his current state of being.  Married. \n\nHe got married is about an event that happened.  Maybe he got married and then got a divorce the next day.  He still got married."
