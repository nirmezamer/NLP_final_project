            "does she regret recording the video because of the comments? cuz if so thatd be pretty sad, this teenage era of angst expression is a rite of passage, but i am glad camera phones werent at todays level when i had mine",

She seems to have put her account on private so I imagine she\u2019s gotten some nasty messages sent her way. She was pretty big on TikTok and there seems to be a whole community for content like that, and if it\u2019s not hurting anyone then I don\u2019t see the need to attack her. I thought it was cool to see her embrace the same type of emo/scene thing I also did back in the day. But exactly, kids do goofy stuff and anybody talking shit on her is most like a huge fucking loser anyways.",

Thousands of diodes were mixed by the Soviets into the building's structural concrete, making detection and removal of the true listening devices by its American occupants nearly impossible.\u00a0\"\n\nI mean a diode is as basic an electronic device as you can find, and it renders it useless.

The procedure is very slow and time consuming, typically involving 2-5 minutes per square yard of surface area.\n\nNon Linear Junction Detectors are available in a variety of power outputs ranging from the \"civilian\" version with an output below 25 mW, to the restricted Government version with a power output over 2 watts ERP.\n\nNormally a 2 Watt NLJD will detect an eavesdropping device through several inches of concrete, inside a wall, or buried deep inside a couch. The lower power units (50-100 mW) on the other hand will only detect eavesdropping devices inside a book, or devices only an inch or so away from the antenna (such as behind a few layers of sheetrock).",

If you wanted to make money as a band you had to sell a lot of records, and one of the best ways to do that was to constantly produce a lot of material. Once they got really established they focused up a bit and became more consistently great because they could afford to.",
            "Man I love some of that wings stuff. A lot of it is mediocre, trying to be Dylan with a band, and almost novelty to a fault. But there are some hidden, and some overplayed, gems. \n\nRam is right up my alley too but it\u2019s not for everyone. I\u2019d recommend that to anyone who hasn\u2019t given it a go.

Time signature is notated with two numbers one on top of the other (4/4, 5/4, 6/8, 12/8 are some common ones.) Tempo is noted either with a single number like \"quarter note = 120\" or with a word usually in italian like \"allegro\".",

Because I can't think of why anyone would say he's not particularly great.",
            "I misspoke when I said tempo (been long day). I meant keeping time and time signatures, which is what the original op I replied to said. What I meant was they are one in the same in the sense that if you are off time then it's totally up in the air if you are even playing a time signature at that point as it could very well be impossible to count out.",

            "My point still stands that there are many instances where you are playing out of time and still in a time signature. Even if what you're saying were true, all that would mean is that time signatures can't be perceived without a sense of time. Not that they are the same thing. The original statement you responded to said Ringo could keep time and play different time signatures. (I can't see it verbatim as I am on mobile) meaning he can hold a steady beat/tempo and play music that would be counted with different grooves. You can make the argument that they are fundamental skills for a drummer but they are not the same skill.",

            "I guess its a trope that has been used in multiple movies then",
            "Dear Diary, \n\nIt's day 15 in the Costco. I wish I had followed the rules posted by /u/Qubed. I have staked out a claim in the deli, where I ravenously devour two rotisserie chickens and half a block of cheese a day. The police have set up a barricade and are begging me to come out. I saw my wife yesterday, she tells me the kids are upset and she wants me to come home. I want to go back to her, I really do but... something about this place has its hooks in me. The crazy deals, the bulk items, the incredible flavors... I just cannot pull away. Maybe tomorrow I'll have started to grow weary of this paradise.",
            "I mean. You're not wrong because Costco is just as worse as gambling lol.",
            "Usually in a room above the casino.\u00a0",
            "I used to manage a bar and pizza place where a lot of the employees were my friends and people within my social circle that I'd partied with regularly prior to working there. I'm not a huge drinker (not to say I don't or haven't had my share of long nights in the past), and one of the hardest parts of the job was having to navigate a lot of these people's addictions, due largely to the place having a party-like atmosphere and culture where drinking certainly wasn't discouraged. Like the number one reason people got fired was because they were TOO drunk on the job, and this would be after several second chances.",
            "I take $20 out of my paycheck and spend it on scratchoffs. I buy the $1 ones because i either get lucky and win 4-ish times, or unlucky and only lose 20 bucks. Ive seen people go in and spend around $500+ in lotto, and it is NUTS.",
            "I knew a slobbering drunkard that was a ward of the state. He took his SOCSEC checks directly to the liquor store and cashed them there then got slobbering drunk and stumbled home (and drinking while stumbling home) where he drank more. He would fall down the stairs and break his arm or leg or ribs. Or crawl into a hole in his basement with a power drill and pass out attempting to drill through the wall with an egg beater in the drill chuck. He was diabetic too, so amongst the thousands of beer cans there were thousands of used needles. He passed on and the house was deemed unfit for human habitation. The city boarded up the windows and just left it like that.",
            "Here in korea you can't spend more than 50,000won(45$) in lottery and other gambling tickets.",
            "This has been going on for a loooong time as well.\n\nI recall back in the late 80's down in Florida when the national lotteries were first becoming insanely big with payouts.\n\nA family remortgaged their home to buy 10,000 tickets thinking they would be assured of a win.\n\nIt didn't work.",
            "No clocks, no windows, the carpeting, the layouts - so much psychology is involved in designing and operating a casino",
            "I\u2019d like to know how banks are even remotely similar",
            "People question banks all the time",
            "Don't be. I had to google to find the details",
            "The other flaw is that they assume you know when to walk away",
            "The fact that people fall victims to these places means that apparently its not that obvious :/",
            "The money can be good when you win but like I said it\u2019s all ugly.",
            "I find blackjack at the casino to be an enjoyable thing to do to waste 50 bucks and an hour of my time at a table with low stakes. Sometimes you win, usually you don't. \n\nIf you look at it as entertainment and can respectfully treat it as such without chasing the win, or worse chasing after your losses,  it can be \"good\". \n\nBut I recognize that a lot of people are incapable of viewing it that way.",
            "It's not a trope, it's a scene that's copied in many movies, but cheaters did it first.",
            "This is poetry",
            "Dammit. Your profile picture fooled me thinking there was a cat hair on my screen. Well done!",
            "I'm sorry this may be a stupid question but how exactly is this enforced?\n\nPer person? Per establishment? Per card? And is it per night? Per month?",
            "And its all to get you to stay there as long as possible, lose as much as possible and come back as much as possible.\n\nThe fact that something like this isn't illegal is wild to me.",
            "Actually the complete opposite, they assume you can play long enough to guarantee the flipped odds start paying off, but you get kicked out within an hour or 2 usually",
            "Go with a budget. Budget is a ticket for entertainment. Sometimes entertainment is free... :D",
            "Yeah I\u2019m not knocking people who enjoy gambling responsibly. I just don\u2019t part take because I\u2019ve seen what it can do to people. Gamblings been around since the dawn of time.",
            "This is how I treat poker nights with buddies or if I ever go to a casino lol\n\nIt can make it really fun especially when you just bet stupidly and bluff and it pays off",
            "Well it is illegal though most places",
            "Yeah that's fair.\n\nI remember taking my long time friend to Vegas some years back. When we were kids we both played the shit out of fallout new Vegas and loved blackjack. I had been a couple time and this was his first and my first in a group that included more than me and my girlfriend. \n\nFirst time at the blackjack table the guy loses all he brought trying to win back what he lost and just obsessed about it for an hour after. You could visibly see the struggle on his face to stop, but he just couldn't. It was that moment I realized that my friend was likely prone to addiction.",
            "Hope you got him outta there before they ended up like the person in post.",
            "Kept him away from the tables for the rest of the trip, for sure. I mostly go for the shows, food, and outdoor stuff anyways."
