I personally used one of these helplines after losing funding as a graduate student during the '08 recession when I was in a really bad way. There is no shame in calling them. At. All.\n\nWhy is this necessary to post and share and sticky? As /u/ThrowawayHistory20 said in a previous thread:\n>Many of us seeking admission to top tier grad schools, and just grad schools in general, grew up our whole lives hearing \u201cwow you\u2019re so smart!\u201d Or \u201cyou\u2019re so good at X field!\u201d from parents, teachers, friends, etc. That then causes many of us, myself included, to internalize this belief that being smart or good at our field or just knowing a lot of things is what makes us valuable. It can help drive us to be good at our field (though in a toxic way because it\u2019s driven by a fear that if we fall behind, we lose the thing that make us valuable), but it also makes rejection very rough.\n\n>We know logically that when we get rejected from a top school in a competitive field that it means \u201cyou were a well qualified applicant, but there were too many well qualified applicants for us to take everyone,\u201d but it can feel more like \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough at the one thing you\u2019re good at and the one thing that gives you value as a human being.\u201d\n\nAgain, please share any additional resources and/or helplines here.\n\nArchived Helpline Info:\n\nIn the US, you can call 988 for crisis support, or 1-877-GRAD-HLP for support specific to graduate students/grad school issues.\n\nText 'HELP' to 741741 in the United States, or 686868 in Canada.\n\nAustralian folks can call 13 11 14.\n\nIn the UK, text 85258.\n\nIn Brazil, The CVV number is 188.\n\nIn India, call 022 2754 6669.",

            "I just got rejected. It was my first time applying as I\u2019m 42 and finishing my undergraduate degree currently. I can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s because I\u2019m older and changing careers. It\u2019s really humbling and definitely not a good experience",

Trying to see it as a blessing because I'm not so sure I even want a PhD anymore.

Sigh. Can't talk to my friends about it because they've been getting good news and I don't want to make them feel like they can't celebrate it with me. So I'm just venting here.

            "I want to make clear before saying this that this is no fault of the professors, I understand that they are incredibly busy and likely do not have time to deeply consider the needs of potential grad students. However, it is extremely frustrating to me when professors don't make it clear on their websites whether they are open to accepting graduate students for the upcoming semester. I feel like it wouldn't take long to just update the lab/faculty website with a line like \"is/not accepting grad students for the 2023 semester.\" Wouldn't it be better that way? That way they wouldn't get hundreds of emails asking about availability. It just feels like the chances of me wasting my time investing in learning about a professors research are relatively high when it isn't clear whether they're open to accepting new students.",

I keep telling myself it is a test of patience but I am seeing folks left and right getting admits while I am lie in the pool of despair. I should be satisfied with my one sole safe admit but the remaining are just testing me to be honest. Every congrats I say these days becomes bittersweet cause even though i feel happy for the person, I further fall in unnecessary stress of \"what will happen to me?\". I know I overestimated myself a bit (split my applications in MS/PhD instead of only MS which was my only plan) thinking I might have a shot of getting a PhD straight out of my undergrad. I honestly feel unis should just send out the rejects instantly for those they don't want instead of giving the false sense of hope by delaying the inevitable. I know this cycle of decisions is something out of my control and I did what i could while building my profile. It is not in my hands and should be grateful but IT IS SO GODDAMN DIFFICULT!

I immediately reached out to the PI who was interested in me told me I could still get in after I explained my situation. The day after the deadline, the graduate program agreed to accept me still and understood my situation. The head of the grad school on that same day, 24 hours after the deadline, said it wouldn't be possible and said I would need to reapply in a year. The program still wants me to reapply again next year as they think I'm a good candidate but I seriously don't know if I'll be around in a year at this point. while this is not a rejection in the way many people may have dealt with it this cycle, it is very hard.

It turns out, that year even the 20% schools were taking 5 applications out of 200 which is a 60% chance of getting rejected from all school. (Assuming each school has the same acceptance rate then doing (1-rate)\\^10). It's just hard.\n\nAnd even when I don't believe in myself, I can look to other people I know who got rejected from all their programs and realize how amazing they are and all of their good qualities, and say that theirs must have been by chance.\n\nGetting rejected is not a school saying no forever.",
            "Haha apparently they just don't tell you if you get rejected. One school responded and said they rejected me but couldn't give me feedback on my application because of how many there were and the other two just never said anything. Disheartening shit.",

            "Ah, okay, gotcha! I was like, well, it seems like you got some really good feedback on that post lol. My apologies. :D",
            "Not at all! This is a great time to start emailing potential advisors. You have at least 4-5 months before applications are due, so there's no rush to get everything done at once. For me, when I get scared about application stuff, it helps to do a little bit at a time and break it into chunks. That way you feel like you have control of the stuff you have control over, which makes the less controled stuff less scary (aka the eventual decisions). \n\nIt also helps with the scariness to talk to peers and mentors. And to remember all the work you've already done to get to the this point. \n\nI know people who got in on their first time applying and people (like me) that got in on their second time applying. Next year, I'll be going somewhere where I didn't get in the first time I applied. No matter what happens when you apply, it's not a reflection of your worth as a person or your potential to do good research. Things will work out even if they don't happen as you expected."

It\u2019s definitely fulfilling and heart-warming to see helpful people out there who give their two cents to the ones in trouble. This post is about me, and I really wish that anyone who is reading this gets something good out of it and does something beyond their limits.\n\nToday marks one of the most memorable days in my life. One must be wondering that this dude might have gotten into Harvard or Stanford, or this dude\u2019s cracked. Well, neither, or maybe the latter depending on your level of tolerance. \n\nI applied to colleges just a couple of months back and I\u2019m satisfied with the admits that I have but I\u2019ve realised that a degree is not going to define me whatsoever. Nor is it going to give me an edge over others. My purpose and passion will. This cascades down to the mental awareness I have which further links to a lot of neurological effects. No matter whatever corner of the world I go to, I\u2019m gonna put my best foot forward. Help people, add meaning to their lives and be the greatest of all time. \n\nTo the people applying to colleges, please remember why you\u2019re doing it. In a world full of cyber-zombies, be the light and invent things which the world has never seen before. I want to gain respect of my loved ones and the people I help, which transcends the materialistic aspects. I want to take the lead. Sure wealth is important, but it wouldn\u2019t be possible without having a meaning to your job. I\u2019m gonna go work a 9-5, gain required skills, work the job that I despise without any complaints, not get irritated by that annoying coworker and later build an empire of my own. All of this will be worth the hustle while I can keep my mental health in check. I want to be the greatest the world has ever seen. ",
