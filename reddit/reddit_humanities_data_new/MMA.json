            "I have some predications for upcoming fights, and I want to set them in writing:\n\nUFC Saudi Arabia:\n\nRobert Whittaker by late TKO. You can tell me Rob's last finish was in 2017 and I don't care. Ikram's coming in with a less-than-ideal weight cut and hasn't prepared for a Top 5 fighter.\n\nSergei by Early KO. I think that Sergei's reach and power will catch Volkov. I think Volkov be technically better, but Sergei's stiff jab will change the dynamic quickly.\n\n*Extra Take:* Based on odds I would actually bet on Volkov by a finish. As training partners, I think Volkov could have Sergei's over hand right \\[the move that starts his brutal finishing sequence\\] completely dialed up. If he becomes a +200 underdog, I would bet on him. (Predication \u2260 bet)\n\nGastelum by UD. Such a shame. I don't actually believe that missed weight fighters win more, but \"missing\" by 15lbs is a different story.\n\nShara vs Trocoli. I don't know. I thought De Spaine (The Cuban TKD HW) was the most hyped fraud and was right. Now that DS lost, I believe Shara is the next biggest fraud right now (If you think I'm wrong, please tell me who else). Realistically, I would predict Shara, but bet on the +400 underdog.\n\nOezdemir by a finish. Oez may not be as explosive and powerful as Walker, but I see Oez being very close plus more technical. *Extra Take: I bet that Oez will implement some grappling and get a takedown in RD1.*",

He has plenty of money.  Why does he even want to return?\n\nI don't think he does want to return.  That's why he pulled out with a pinky toe.  I mean ffs I wait tables, and I wouldn't call out of a waiting tables shift for a broken pinky toe.  He must really just be over it.  And he should be, he's done what he can, guy's a legend.",

If you are put Rob vs this guy today in PFL, I guarantee it would be boring but it will be exciting to watch in UFC. Other leagues used to be good go watch 15 years ago. Ima become a UFC Shill like rest of this place, they only league now that makes it decent, granted last UFC card was so dreadful and long I left after 3 fights.

It's not a weight cutting contest.\n\nIt makes sense if done well before the fight with both agreeing.  It is a terrible idea to allow a wrestler to come in heavy on short notice, because its a big advantage.\n\nEDIT: just notice you said \"title fights\" they can't be outside the weight class and still be title fights, so I assume you meant non-title there, which was what my original response was to.",

Its one of the reasons its tragic that him v. Costa didn't come off: if he could rag doll Costa, then the size is not a problem.\n\nIf he started only at 185 he would have to work his way up through the ladder rather than being rushed directly to the title.  I think that might be difficult with guys like Costa, Canonnier, or even Vittori, all of whom are big, have perhaps enough TDD to survive, and would be durable on the feet, and Jared in particular would be a bad man to be exhausted against on the feet.",
