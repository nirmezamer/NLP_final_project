            "Hoping someone might be able to lend some insight into what's going on with this blue salvia. I bought three plants (presumably all the same...) late last summer and planted them in the yard. The existing stems were pretty wimpy and all died/fell off over fall/winter, but they came back surprisingly strong. Now that they're coming in, two look bushy, green, and healthy, while the third is looking pretty sad and wilty. They're all in roughly the same area, probably get the same amount of light, and they all get watered at the same time, more or less the same amount. At first I thought it looked maybe over-watered, so I tried to cut back and kind of watered around it. Didn't really show improvement over a couple days, and I also read that leaves tend to curl up when underwatered, so now I'm watering it again, but it still looks about the same. Soil doesn't seem wet or mushy. Pretty sandy/dry sticking my finger in an inch or so down. So... I dunno.\n\nIs there something more I should be doing? Is it just genetics? Also, the other two salvias have real wide, fat leaves, but this one has narrow, spindly leaves. Genetics again, or maybe I bought a different variety by mistake?\n\nOh, it basically gets full sun and I'm in zone 7b. Low humidity, dry, has been high 80s, low 90s the last couple weeks, brief cold front aside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8vthg1y2y7d1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15bbd98c034289c5228b8b8c4b3ba870a6e6c151",

Any suggestions for plants that might enjoy my conditions but that bloom earlier in the season? I'm basically bloomless until mid-July when everything pops off at once",
            "What do I do about all this (maybe) purslane that's emerged in my raised beds? For context, I moved into this new place less than a month ago, and just barely had time to amend the soil of these raised beds and pull approximately five million weeds before planting in them. It seems that my turning over awoke a dormant seed bank, and now we have what looks like purslane all over. Will this be a problem for the plants, including the basil that I planted from seed? And if so, how should I deal with it so that I don't harm the peppers, beans, tomatoes and tomatillos that are in here? Photo for reference, it's quite dense in this bed especially.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j58kxyn1vy7d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f6cd8456480ef108400e56611f1daaa241edee8",

I already planted some beans as I read they\u2019re a good choice. I probably should\u2019ve thought about this before but I\u2019m worrying if this area is too shady. So I was wondering did I screw up and plant something that won\u2019t survive? And what suggestions would you guys have for new additions that would fit will into this area\n\nPictures were taken at approximately noon\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yard-photos-jfFpX0f](https://imgur.com/a/yard-photos-jfFpX0f)\n\nI'm in eastern Pennsylvania, zone 7a",

            "I\u2019m at my wits end with the critters here (Pennsylvania zone 6b). I suspect squirrels and rabbits. They chew some - not all - my lilies, leaving just a stem. Others they dig in the soil/mulch and just leave holes in the ground. They dig up my creeping thyme and irises - apparently just for the fun of it because they aren\u2019t eating anything. I\u2019ve tried those cayenne pepper sprays and sprinkled red pepper flakes, but it doesn\u2019t keep them at bay for long. Is the anything at all that deters them? They\u2019re such jerks! Do I have to build little chicken wire fences around everything?",

I'm fine while squatting but as soon as I stand back up I get slammed with fuzzy head, vision going dark, face feels flushed, and heart beats like crazy. Then like 30 seconds later I'm fine. I don't have any DX medical conditions (tested for POTS 8 years ago, tilt test negative). If anyone else gets this I'd love to know how you garden around it or if you've ignored it, whether it was fine or got worse.

            "Can someone help me get a better understanding of different fertilizers? \n\nI recently got all my plants into pots with a raised bed/container mix that came premixed with some nutrients. The bag said N=0.3% P=0.1% K=0.1%. \n\n  \nI've read that in containers fertilizing every 2 weeks or so is a good idea so that was my plan for this weekend. \n\nI've seen recommendations for a few different brands of things but I'm a bit confused by the NPK.\n\nIn one case, Neptunes Harvest Tomato and Veg solution, the NPK is listed as 2-4-2. Then I looked at Miracle-Gro performance organics edibles mix and the NPK is MUCH higher at 9-4-12. Those are the extremes but other mixes have been 5-7-3, 4-4-4, etc. \n\nMy question is why is there such a wide range here? I don't want to go overboard but I also don't want to under fertilize. \n\nAt this point I think I'm supposed to prioritize the nitrogen to encourage plant growth over flowering (I've got tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers) so I'm just trying to figure out what the best thing I should add is and how best to do it. \n\nThanks!",

I would like it to be useful w/r/t insects and/or birds (the more boxes it ticks, the better). I came across the Heptacodium miconioides (seven-sons tree) myself, which is beautiful and seems very useful indeed. (Oh and I'm in zone 7 or 8, that might be useful.)",

            "Here is a list of native flowers that like sun and bloom in May/June:  [https://www.wildflower.org/plants/combo.php?fromsearch=true&distribution=&habit=habit\\_herb&duration=&light\\_sun=1&may=1&jun=1](https://www.wildflower.org/plants/combo.php?fromsearch=true&distribution=&habit=habit_herb&duration=&light_sun=1&may=1&jun=1)  I have woodland phlox in full sun. It blooms for a month - quite a long time in early spring. It is probably not rated for full sun but it does fine in spring sun in my yard. Another very interesting plant is prairie smoke. It starts off with nodding red blooms and slowly transitions to the \"smoke\" look. Ultimately, they have wavy off white hairs ready to carry seed to new places which reflects its other name of old man's whiskers. You have a treasure in your state, [PrairieMoon.com](http://PrairieMoon.com) There are other native plant sellers in your state. Look online. Fall, after a hard frost, is a good time to put in native plants. Plugs and bare root plants are much cheaper than quart or gallon sized nursery plants. Deer and rabbits eat tulips but leave daffodils alone so that's another option.",

            "move them to the right of the tree, where the sun is shining. You're right, that's too much shade. In a shady area, about the only thing that will grow is ornamentals.  Try some impatiens flowers and hostas if that spot is all day sun.",
            "Every once in a while I actually have tulip blooms. The rest of the time, deer and rabbits feast, the old nipped in the bud robbery. If you have a perennial herb like one of the sages, prune it back in spring and sprinkle the trimmings around/over the plants to be protected. I've never seen critters bother iris unless you have been working the soil and it's nice and easy digging for them. There are repellents which are said to work. I don't know how much they repel humans with their smell! Names I hear the most are Deer Out and Liquid Fence. One strike against blood meal is the smell but it is said to work. I don't know if the first two are safe for veg. gardens.",
            "I got this a lot when I restarted yoga almost a year ago, in transitioning from bending/squatting to standing upright. Part of what helped me was just taking the movement slower; I think I also got used to it over time, and I don't notice it as much now, whether for yoga or gardening. If this is relatively new for you and you've been gardening for a while without it, would def recommend talking to your doc. Is there a possibility that you're dehydrated/undernourished while you're out gardening? Sometimes it seems like easy work to the brain but it can be quite laborious for the body!",
            "re: fertilizer.  There's a wide range because different plants have different needs.  N= nitrogen, P= phosphorous K potassium.    Nitrogen promotes green leaves, phosophorous promotes flowers, and darned if I can remember what K does.  Just buy some 8-8-8.  Then do some research on what needs what. I do remember that Tomatoes are heavy feeders, they like a good bit of nitrogen.  HOWEVER, remember that Tomatoes, cucumbers and almost every other veg starts with the flowers- that's the phosphorous part, so don't skip it.  If you feel the need to feed every two weeks, just get some miracle grow and mix it with water.  Honestly- try not to overthink it, just don't give each plant like two cups of fertilizer and you'll do fine.",
            "Higher numbers of NPK generally mean you use less product per application. Those ferts aren't inherently better. Organic fertilizers have very low numbers compared to chemically manufactured ferts. That doesn't mean chemical ferts are stronger or better; it does mean that a smaller volume is used. Whatever you buy, read the instructions on the container! Applying every 2 weeks may not be correct. It depends on the product.",

            "It sure looks dry although there's a chance a vole or something is nibbling on roots. Try weekly watering of 5 gallons per sq. yard, roughly an inch. When temps are over 85F. increase to twice weekly. Mulch is a big help retaining moisture in soil. 2 inches of wood chips is enough. Don't put it against plant stems.",
            "Ok that's what I was thinking, and fussing with a bit this morning. It seems like a shallow root system so hopefully it won't come back? Kind of an annoying little task, but alas, the things we do for our gardens lol.",

            "I eat it! I usually saut\u00e9 some in with a more desirable crop (like black eyed peas or spinach) just to bulk up harvest and change the flavor a bit. It has a very light flavor and is supposedly full of nutrients. \n\nSometimes I purposely use it for ground cover over deep rooted vegetables. The purslane is so shallow it\u2019s not really competing. It WILL return. I live in a very harsh climate. All the things people talk about invading their yard doesn\u2019t really happen for me. But purslane is everywhere.",
            "Ahh that makes sense. Yea, I wonder if your proprioception just needs to adjust to it. I hope it gets better!",
            "Ah this is really interesting, thanks for sharing! That's curious that it can be a sort of microgreen, do you eat the roots too, or just the tops? I think I'll try to keep it from going to seed if nothing else, but that's cool that you actually like it for ground cover too. I haven't wanted to mulch this year so maybe I'll just... let this do it, lol.",
            "I sorta just yank it up and chop so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s been root segment in there too. Lol\n\nAnother thing I do, since there\u2019s so much and it supposedly contains so many micros, is make compost tea from whatever I pull. For one, it guarantees it\u2019s dead. It\u2019s one of those (for my climate at least) if you drop the tiniest piece, it will root. It seems to make a really good additive."
