            "just finished Slow Horses Season 1, Gary Oldman is brilliant as Jackson Lamb really looking forward to next seasons \n\nFollowing The Boys weekly, Episode 4 was diabolical \n\nAnd waiting for The Bear next week",
            "Presumed Innocent. A high level adult drama. Not just a thriller. It explores the tumultuousness of marriage. Jake G really is at his best playing Rusty a complex character. The dialogue is amazing. It gives you a peek into inner desires and weaknesses we all have. \n\nI went in expecting suspense, but came out loving how mature it was. I was completely pulled in by the characters. Ruth Negga is also terrific as his wife. \n\nOnly 1 episode in so far, but I'd give it an 8.5",
            "**Detroiters**  \nDecided to give this show a try after seeing it recommended here. Wow. I haven't laughed this much since Cunk on Earth. The characters are likeable and natural. And someone on the writing team must be from Michigan!\n\n**Blue Lights S2** \n\nAlmost done and very much enjoying it. Seems like all the actors have unique faces.\n\n**Colin From Accounts S2**\n\nNo drop in quality from S1.",
            "Ripely on Netflix is astoundingly good. I thought Shogun was going to put the cap on this year. Nope.\n\nIt\u2019s maybe not everyone\u2019s speed, but damn. Every single shot of this show is cooking.",
            "**House of the Dragon** - I found myself not remembering some things after watching the first episode, so I binged S1. I enjoyed it SO much more than my original watch. I think I still had severe GOT PTSD before.\n\n\n**The Boys** - I'm on the pro team for this season, very much enjoy still",
            "My family and I started Wings last night. It\u2019s so fun! Can\u2019t wait to keep watching. Very underrated",
            "I don't usually bring up anime on here but since a lot of you liked Scavengers Reign I thought some of you might also like some of my favorite strange unique anime. They're not at all similar, just some more one of a kind shows, that are probably not for everyone but hopefully those that are into it will love them. There's a lot of different types of anime out there and usually only the mainstream ones ever get mentioned, so a lot of people think anime is all just like demon slayer, attack on titan, naruto etc. Also these are only 12 episodes (20 minutes each).\n\n**Mononoke** (2007 series on Netflix) - really unique art style kind of like woodblock art, very colorful. It was recently remastered so I could finally watch it in good quality when it came to netflix. Definitely a classic. It's basically short stories about a guy who exorcises demons by discovering the circumstances of the curse. I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix. And there's a new movie coming out next month for the 15th anniversary that looks [drop dead gorgeous.](https://youtu.be/0x-SryQQmRs)\n\n**Sonny Boy** (Hulu) - this is one of those trippy confusing shows with a non-linear timeline. It's about kids that end up in an alternate world/reality in a sort of Everything Everywhere All at Once sort of way. It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it.\n\nI actually have quite a lot more great unique anime I could mention, but idk if anyone is even gonna care or read this lol.",
            "Dark Matter: after a slow start, it just gets better and better\n\nTrying: the most underrated series on TV. Season 4 is great. Just want more and more episodes \n\nHouse of Dragon season 2: first episode was ok",
            "**Trying** (2020) - Finished s1. This British comedy about a couple who wants to adopt is sweet but not too sweet. Picked it up when I needed a break from heavy stuff and I was pleasantly surprised.",
            "I just discovered \u201cThe Boys.\u201d I have laughed out loud more in the past 4 hours than I have in 4 months. I\u2019m not going to bed until I finish season one (4 more episodes left)!\n\nAnd yes, I highly recommend it. Especially if you watched the first 5 seasons of Supernatural (Kripke!!).",
            "***My So-Called Life*** \n\nIt's been on my watchlist for years, but I just started it on a whim the other day. I'm loving it. I'm only four episodes deep, but it's great. Claire Danes is amazing! It's wild to know she was only fifteen-years-old while filming it, because she was already a pretty great actor. \n\nI'm surprised by the amount of mature subjects the show has touched on in just a few episodes. This aired on ABC in 1994, and was a show ostensibly for teens, so it's wild to think they let this air (but then maybe it's also the reason it didn't last beyond one season). \n\nI'll say that having to watch Jared Leto is a bit of a negative, and so far his character is kind of an asshole. But who knows, maybe he'll have some kind of redemption arc that will make him more tolerable.\n\nBut overall, I'm really enjoying it, and I'll be sad when all nineteen episodes are over. I'm trying to remind myself that nineteen episodes is kind of the modern-day equivalent of 2.5 seasons, so that I'll feel less sad when there's no more.\n\n---\n\n**Can I get some recommendations for maybe 1990s\u20132000s coming-of-age dramedy series that are similar?** (Already watched ***Freaks & Geeks*** last year, which I loved.)",

            "\n**The Bad Kids** - Brilliant watch and brilliant ending. Chinese series streaming free on iQIYI.  Going to miss the adventures of Chaoyang, Pupu, and Yan Liang. \n\n**House of the Dragon S2** - Great premiere.  Noticed O\u2019Hara from **Warrior** as the blacksmith and hoping we see more of him.  Haven\u2019t read books but assume we will be. \n\n**Presumed Innocent** - random thoughts: Ruth Negga deserves way better. The DA, Nico, has to be one of the most punchable dudes ever. Not sure how I feel about the show otherwise so far. \n\n**Interview with the Vampire S2** - incredible show. Incredible. \n\n**Dark Matter** - it has officially hit the fan.  Finale is looking to be good. \n\n**Blue Lights S2** - Great cop show set in Belfast, Ireland. Love Stevie played by Martin McCann \n\n**The Lazarus Project S2** - really enjoying but also confuses me to no end lol.",

            "I'm still enjoying **Trying** but it still feels like quite the fall from the heights of S1-S2. It's like Apple TV saw the success of **Ted Lasso** and decided all of their comedies needed to be borderline saccharine to work.",
            "Any good spy series? Strong tacticool/operator vibes, nothing like a regular action like say, Reacher.\n\nA little more action, less slow burn tense mindgames so something like The Americans or even Homeland isn't also what I'm looking for right now.\n\nNot very comedic either. I've heard of the Recruit but a quick look at the trailers and it seems to have a little more humor than what I want. \n\nI've seen Jack Ryan and Terminal List. 24 is a classic, of course.\n\n**Thanks**",

            "Finished MOVING, a Korean drama about people with superpowers. It was fantastic. The show starts small, focussing on just a few high school kids. The story slowly broadens to their parents, who they inherited their powers from, and it begins to get really wild.",

            "**Dead To Me**\n\nThis is funnier than it has every right to be.  Only note is that in S2, the Michelle actress really needs to go back to acting school because in her very first appearance, her emoting very clearly visibly telegraphed the upcoming relationship plot twist with Judy.  As a result I was very not surprised attest of the alls when they finally hooked up.  I've never been to drama class a day in my life and can maintain a poker face when a parent tries to act like they hadn't yelled at me last year for not letting their stupid idiot kid cheat at disc golf.  The other supporting characters were great:  Nick, Perez, the good-looking fella from Jury Duty; it's just that whoever directed Michelle didn't think to say, \"Hey, uh, dial back the male gaze a bit.\"  Also, if you're a fan of Married with Children, there is a very surprising near-reunion to be had in the penultimate episode.\n\n5/5, actually funny women to be found here.",
            "Just finished series 2 of **Blue Lights**: It\u2019s a bit uneven (some of the character choices frustrated me) but overall very well done. I appreciated the dark humor, and it felt balanced. The show neither lionizes police work nor denigrates the job. Dan Gordon, who plays Rab, gives one of the most moving monologues I\u2019ve seen in a spell.",

I can\u2019t tell the difference between two of main hockey players cause they look and act the same. One doesn\u2019t even speak or interact with the other cast. And the actor who plays Sanguinet looks and sounds like he\u2019s 16 years old. \n\nI obviously still like the show but I don\u2019t know how people like anything other than Shoresy the character.",
            "Wasn\u2019t this week but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning a few weeks ago I finished season 35 of The Simpsons. So I have officially seen all 768 episodes of the show. I don\u2019t know how it happened. It went by so fast. Even as the show got noticeably worse I couldn\u2019t turn to anything else because the Simpsons had quickly become my comfort show. I may have to give it a rest for a moment but boy do I miss those characters already.",
            "The Boys S4: I don't think it's the worst season or that the writing has taken a dip, but it is getting harder and harder to watch. It's getting very depressing and a little too real. \n\nMiss Scarlet and the Duke: The main characters' budding romance is really cute, and they have a lot of chemistry.",

            "Acolyte doesn't deserve the vitriol, episode 3 was dull but the others have been entertaining and at a good pace. \n\nFargo s3 - not as good as 1 and 2 imo but still high quality\n\nThe Fable anime is superb, the various interweaving threads of the story is written so well and all the characters get you invested in some way with them. \n\nHouse of the Dragon , strong opening episode shits escalating again already.\n\nThe Boys is the Boys the satire is now unapologetic and nails the current media climate and Homelander always has you on the edge of your seat. The new noir is hilarious as is the deeps arc. \n\nJames May in Japan, easy watching and interesting I hope he gets into some proper wacky shit.",
            "This season of Doctor Who started off rocky, got better with each episode leading to some absolutely amazing episodes of television with episodes 4 & 5 in particular, but did not stick the landing of the finale.

Whenever folks here mention how ***Ted Lasso*** fell off in quality, I always try to point them to ***Trying*** as a show that's even more feel-good, yet maintains its quality throughout.\n\nThis season does feel like a bit of a departure in terms of its focus. The focus has shifted to Princess and her story, so we're seeing less of Nikki and Jason's, but it's still so sweet and funny, and we're still getting to see all the various parents'/grandparents' growth.",

It depicted all the crap we were dealing with at that time so it really resonated with my age range! Unfortunately, the show was ahead of its time. I don\u2019t think America/many parents were ready to deal with the issues. Yes, your child may be gay, have a drug problem or may be friends with someone who is. Or in my case, out partying on a school night when you\u2019re 15-16 years old and hung over the next morning during first period. Oops. Most of the storylines are still relevant today.

Like it's *going* somewhere, and there's not a lot of time to experience the characters. I suppose it's mainly because we're kinda following Princess on this clue-by-clue treasure hunt, and lots of her racing to various locations. \n\nBut still, I think it's cool and interesting, and it's bold of the show to change up it's structure in this most recent season, which makes me wonder if it'll be the final one.",

Because Target is a for-profit corporation, not a public service that was created to serve as a backbone of our democracy and a way to keep the people well-informed in a time before, Internet, TV or even radio. \n\nAny mail issues you have are due to, as the parent comment said, politically-motivated attacks against the organization. The USPS is a constitutionally-mandated public service. But because of political interference, is the only one that is required to run as a for-profit business and further was made by republicans to be required to fund its pension program a decade in advance from those profits\u2026 something that is not required of any other government agency. These imposed costs to what *should* be a public service funded by our taxes (like every other government agency) are the reason it has become an unreliable mess. \n\nIf you want a proper comparison to Target, it\u2019s like if Target\u2019s board of directors cut resources and budgets from their locations, making it impossible to staff stores properly resulting in terrible service, bad selection and a ruined reputation specifically because they *wanted* the company to fail.

I also lose out on non taxable benefits in Canada because the US does not recognize their tax free status.\n\nI want to renounce but can't justify the cost until I know for sure that I'll never need to return to the US.

A 15 degree per hour drift,\" Knodel says, acknowledging that the gyroscope's behavior confirmed to exactly what you'd expect from a gyroscope on a rotating globe.\n\n> \"Now, obviously we were taken aback by that. 'Wow, that's kind of a problem,'\" Knodel says. \"We obviously were not willing to accept that, and so we started looking for ways to disprove it was actually registering the motion of the Earth.\"\n\n> Despite further experimental refinements, Knodel's gyroscope consistently behaves as if the Earth is round. Yet Knodel's beliefs seem unchanged when discussing the experiment at a Flat Earth meetup in Denver. \"We don't want to blow this, you know? When you've got $20,000 in this freaking gyro.

It was the little shit , like the parts about having your parent\u2019s business under your name , or paying off your parent\u2019s house that made it so relatable. The realest part to me was when the guy built his parent\u2019s house but it burned down cuz he did the electric wiring wrong. That\u2019s some shit my cousin would do. So sad to see S2 not have more of this :(",

            "I hope not. Despite him being a favorite character of mine, I despised the episodes I watched. It was painful & I stopped without finishing, which is uncommon for me.\n\nIsaac is too talented to be wasted on the flailing MCU nonsense they're cranking out. It's not like they're ever planning to actually do anything cool with the character anyway.",
            "I had a dream it existed, but it was a secret release with a different title",
            "I'm pretty sure Moon Knight is going to be folded into the Midnight Sons project they're doing",

            "It was also refreshing to see Asian leads in a show that didn\u2019t have a specific race driven plot. Almost like the show was written for anyone and season 1 legitimately used Asians and it was successful. For some reason that feels like a bigger win for Asians than the show just being about Asians.",
            "Other races can be bad drivers too.",
            "Got success from season 1 and ditched Asians and comedians and went for the big name stars. I can\u2019t see this having the same charm.",

            "You are absolutely right. It's disappointing because we don't get a lot of Asian American representation while we already have so many white stories.",
            "Honestly, it is. Like, I don't doubt that it will be good, and this is great casting for a drama. Still, when I originally heard about the casting, I just thought \"oh, this is going to be totally unrelatable now.\" I also imagined someone at A24 saying, \"No, I am sorry, but you exhausted that topic in the last season.\"",
            "I don't really get the assumptions people have over it being pointless. If it's about entirely different people, it's essentially just a different show about people who have beef, made by the same people. It could be shit or it could be even better than the first season. It's not tacking on unnecessary plot lines for a show that should've been finished, it's a different thing",
            "I mean, so long as the characters from Season 1 are over and done with.\n\nThey could continue to make the series between 2 new characters with beef every year. There are a lot of different directions they could go with this each season to make them all feel very different.",
            "It doesn\u2019t and I feel like this casting misses part of the fun of the first season. Also a huge part of the first season was Asian representation. Seems weird to just drop that",

Additionally, trades reported Marvel was overhauling their TV division to operate more like a traditional TV arm, rather than them trying to force TV shows to fit into their film production method. Now they\u2019ll have creatives pitch shows to them, develop series bible, and arc out plan for multiple seasons in advance. And that takes times.\n\nWith the pullback in shows- and Daredevil Born Again (now split into two seasons), Agatha All Along, Wonder Man, Ironheart, and vision quest all lined up for the next couple years, I don\u2019t think they need to rush any more announcements out.",

Shogun was so great in large part due to Hiroyuki Sanada as a producer, and how they hired Japanese experts on history/language/tradition.

The studio heads more or less ignore Agents of SHIELD despite it being a fan favorite that ran for seven seasons, proving the 20-odd episode seasons can work if done right (for the first five seasons at least). As someone who would love to write for Marvel someday (any division really), I still think a spiritual successor to AoS about SWORD (as introduced in WandaVision) could make for a good ongoing series. Take the less-explored parts of Marvel mythos and explore that whole side of things like AoS before it. But that's just one idea I think has potential. I agree that they likely won't drop TV completely, but taking some aspects of what worked before under Marvel TV and not having a racist SOB in charge could work.",
