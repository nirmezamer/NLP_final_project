            "This is how high school dating has always been. Talk to some old people, and they'll tell you. My grandma tells me sometimes about her high school experiences and it's basically the same thing as you say.\n\n  \nYou just have to get older, and people will mature and be more prepared for a serious relationship. As a teen, most of us don't really know who we are yet, and we definitely don't know what kind of things we want in a person, what kinds of things we need out of a relationship, what things to avoid in a relationship, how to communicate well, etc. So as you get older and figure that stuff out more, and your peers do the same, relationships will change from the more superficial current ones to longer-lasting, deeper relationships",

The only real difference is that contraception wasn\u2019t as common so those forays usually led to shotgun marriages and commitments lol.",

You're ignorant to the fact it's been like this for A LONG LONG TIME, social media brings it about more and exposes it. This is not an exclusive to this generation thing.\n\nLook at the the 90s, the 80s.

A lot of people are genuine, and do want to put actual effort into maintaining a relationship with you or whoever else.\n\nCompatibility is also an important aspect of relationships.  You need to have similar views and hobbies, or at least be willing to try each other's hobbies.",
            "That's a bad way of thinking, most likely you eont be getting in longterm relationship. Just about 99% of relationships are genuine. If they aren't, the relationship end earlier on. Just because one person or both wants to do more sex does not mean the relationship is ruined.",

            "Yeah, there are a lot of people like that. It's honestly sad. I remember seeing that kind of culture in a show (which contained college students), and I couldn't see the appeal of just having sex with every person. I mean, c'mon, there's more to life than that! You could be having a date with someone really special, or playing a video game with your friends, or spending alone time reading manga or something.",
            "I love me and my gf, we are seriously dating. We both care for each other. I make sure she is comfortable with doing anything and I make sure she is ok emotionally and physically. I don\u2019t want to ever let her go and I am very confident that I will be marrying her.",

            "I think the reason you say that because of social media. Most people still seriously date and usually the end goal is either marriage and/or children. There are a good chunk that are like this but that\u2019s not the normal world my guy.",
            "That's what I don't get why start dating if your not in love. That's why I have refused to date up until now where I have finally found someone I genuinely like only issue is I don't know have to approach",

            "Dating in high school has never really been about commitment or deep emotional attachment\n\nOf course there are exceptions and couples that stay together for the rest of their lives, but that is a very small minority of high school relationships\n\nI wouldn't worry too hard about finding a long term partner right now, and this honestly seems like a pretty chronically online take\n\nIf you want to find emotional connection, sure, go for it, but there's no need to be stressing about this so early in life",
            "I'm glad someone shares the same opinion as me on this. Most people in our generation barely even care about love anymore and it's sad to see because people should have a partner who loves and cares for them, someone who supports them when there down, someone who will pour there heart and soul in to that person and be loyal. Not some ass who basically cares about showing them off like a trophy and treating them like nothing but a thing they can bang once and awhile.",

            "I agree completely I\u2019m 16 and  I hate people who only talk to you to get there sexual needs out and it hurts people it happened to me about a year ago and it sucked. I just want a loyal boyfriend who will look at me with love and compassion is that so hard to ask for?

            "The best thing to do is wait and work on yourself until you are ready. If everyone did this, then the dating scene would be fundamentally different.",
            "Me and my girlfriend are both seriously dating because we both actually care about each other and each other's feelings and genuinely love each other, you just have to find the right person and unfortunately some people don't understand that they also have to be the right person",

            "At this point, I just drag myself along like a broken leg, the way I stay single. The reason, is because of this exact way that dating has turned into something for sex or status. I don't want that, so I'm going to stay the way I am, by myself. No point in dressing well, being buff, or having good looks when you've got no reason for it.",

            "i\u2019ve never heard of situationships. but dating apps can be kinda scary too because you don\u2019t know these people either and like you said, they can be unserious and just want to mess around, which sucks. a lot of people used to tell me to \u201cwait and you\u2019ll find the right person. put yourself out there\u201d i think there\u2019s someone out there for everyone tho, you just haven\u2019t found them yet",

Why does that mean that there is something wrong with them?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlso, hedonism has\u00a0existed since the beginning of (human) time, mindless fucking is literally why we exist. Some of the most developed societies had \"hookup culture\" in fact, serious relationships are a modern idea. 1800s-1960s (take with a large grain of salt) had this whole idea of purity, we ditched that while holding onto the idea of relationships.\u00a0\n\nI will restate, if you are an undesirable romantic partner, that doesn't mean there is a problem with the \"dating pool\" or you.

It was rough (the long distance, the actual relationship was good for being my first) and also led into covid. \n\nThe enemy of relationships is the friendzone or a situationship, generally this occurs when you've spent a good amout of time with the person of interest, but never signaled interest. (At least imo) . \n\nMy best advice is be patient and wait till you meet someone you really vibe with and like, spend time with them, but also give them space. Then sooner rather than later ask them out (stiking the balance between too soon and too late is important) I asked my current gf out after about 8hrs of face to face interactions. Over the course of a week and a half or so. I wanted to ask her out in person but due to the circumstances of the evening I ended up shooting her a message afterwards just basically writing out the thought i was going to say in person. In said message I mentioned that we didn't know each other that well and can understand if she feels shee need more time. \n\nShe ended up agreeing that she wanted to spend more time to get to know me (very fair) and that she wasn't ready for a relationship right now (also fair she'd relatively recently gotten out of a mildly toxic relationship) over the course of the next 2 weeks we spent more time together, in group scenarios but also privately. Sometime during that week she took me up on the date offer. Over the next 2 and a half month till the end of the semester we spent some part of almost every day together (minus a week for  spring break).\n\nThis is not to brag but all just context to say:\nBe open and honest about your interest\nBe open to the possibility of it not immediately being yes or no, and if you really like them be willing to wait, at least for a bit. \nTry to be confident in you, your interests, hobbies, your own body, etc. I had lots of insecurities about my body, but she either doesn't see them as a problem, or loves them. Luckily I was going to a tech school so I was less worried about people finding my hobbies wierd. \n\nBut, confidence, patience, and honesty to the right people will mean the world to them. \n\nBest of luck out there,\nA random redditor who knows OPs username is a lie\n\nEdit: I should add the previous relationship was a girl I met at a theater festival from another school (common interest)\nI was in college (I'm in the process of dropping out) when I met my current gf and we connected on a common interest of the cars movie franchise. \n\nHaving some kind of surface level common interest is a helpful starting point but not required, showing interest in things other people like even if you don't have that specific interest is good too. I had never previously had an interest in F1 before meeting her. Now I sit down and watch the race every Sunday there is one.",
            "By from now, dating right now is so ruined. Due to it's factor on how teenagers gaves a view point from it, Once they get rejected by a girl. They are starting to think that their world is about to end, meanwhile this freaks em out so bad. But it doesn't mean that once they get rejected already from a girl. They are a loser, ugly, or not attractive.\n\nHere's my point: Whenever a BOY is struggling to find someone who can be with them, they start to think their world is about end. Because it's too late, which that kind sucks. Because love has the right time, with a right person. Otherwise, a real man who has the same situation but different consequences. They start to evaluate what does society means from them, this also gives them anxiety some time to think. But when time goes by, they start to accept that it's not that much easy to find for a someone who is really interested in them, they start to find someone who really wants to be with them. Like, \"date to marry\" which is a good thing.\n\nNowadays, it's good to wait rather than urge a person  who has not the same interest as you. Every person has their own standards or maybe they have their own reason, to find someone at the right time. (Sorry for this trash opinion)\n\n\"Common sense is not always common\"",
