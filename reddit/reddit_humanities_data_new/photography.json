What can I chose ?\n\n[Gear](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/?f=flair_name%3A%22Gear%22)\n\nI'm planning to return to photography after more than a decade of using only my cellphone. I'm particularly frustrated with my travel photos and want to invest in a mirrorless camera. My last camera was an old Nikon D5200. I intend to use the new camera primarily for travel photography, focusing on landscapes and street scenes. I don't have any interest in filming. To start, I'm looking for one or two versatile lenses.\n\nWhy Fuji? I've heard good things about the brand, especially the quality of their images. Most importantly, I appreciate that I can use the JPEG files directly with Fuji's film simulations, as I'd prefer to avoid spending hours editing RAW files. However, choosing a camera from the second-hand market is challenging. I don't have a specific budget, but I'm aiming for a \"good deal\"\u2014let's say around $1500 for the camera and one travel lens.\n\nHere's what I've found so far:\n\n* The XT3 is the least expensive, available for around $500-600 in my area. I'm concerned about it becoming outdated, though.\n* The XS10 and XT4 are available for around $700.\n* The XS20, which seems great with its new film simulations, is around $1000.\n\nI'm unsure if I need weather sealing or in-body stabilization since I won't be recording videos. With these prices being quite close, it's difficult to decide which deal is the best. Should I consider another brand or perhaps a good bridge camera instead?\n\nSorry, this post has been removFuji ?

            "Just a general opinion ask. I\u2019ve been using a Nikon D80 for a bit now. I\u2019ll be looking to upgrade sometime in the next year. Naturally I looked at Nikon but I realized the mount type is different on the mirrorless camera so it would be a whole setup overhaul in theory (body and two lenses). With that, for just nature and bird photography, what brands and cameras have you enjoyed? Assuming Mirrorless is the proper change now.  I\u2019d looked to find it used so any expertise on when to shop would also be great!",

I know that the body is great for a beginner to learn on and get started and I don't want to just tell him to go out and upgrade right away.\n\n He also has the Google pixel 8 takes Amazing photos too. Do you think his Cannon would be worth taking on a trip to Japan in September? Or would you suggest if he's really into it, to upgrade within his budget prior to the trip and take a totally new-to-him camera.",

I find it hard to nail focus. My first impression was that I thought the autofocus was faulty too far back  when I tries it on objects - so I adjusted it plus 5 forward. Then I shot a few portraits with friends and the focus was on the tip of the nose but not perfectly on eyes. It got good when I adjusted it to plus 1. \n\nSo my question is if this is normal for f1.4 and changing this setting on every shooting is normal? Am I doing something else wrong? Pls help.",

She does mainly does portraits, weddings, and some fine art photography and uses Adobe Lightroom to edit. She primarily posts picture online, so I made sure each monitor had 100% SRGB.

However, I'd prefer a one-time purchase program (like Capture One) that I can connect to a cloud service.\n\nSo I guess I'm looking for two recommendations:\n\n1. A program that is comparable to Lightroom but is not subscription-based. It should integrate reasonably well with cloud services.\n\n2. A cloud service to store a large amount of RAW, JPEG (and ideally movies) for a more reasonable fee like $10 or $20 a month.\n\nI would prefer a service that doesn't strip information from the files either in terms of downsampling or getting rid of EXIF information.",
            "I am trying to find a good backpack for taking out with family. I currently have a Peak Design 3L sling and a LowePro GearUp Creator Box II (Large) backpack insert. Over last few years I have tried to find a good backpack that offers a small camera compartment for my Fuji X-T3 + 16-80mm + 70-300mm. \n\nThe LowePro insert is actually a great size for the camera/lenses, but a bit of a pain to take in/out of the backpack I toss it in since I usually have bunch of kids clothes and snacks in there too. The photography focused backpacks that seem to be properly sized for my camera/lenses have a very small general compartment and usually just 1 slot for water bottles (LowePro Truckee LX 150). The ones that are larger and have 2 water bottle pockets seem to be way oversized in the camera compartment (LowePro Truckee BP 250). \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for a crossbody or backpack that has 2 water bottle slots for the kids, good general storage space, and the camera section sized for a small mirrorless camera like the X-T3?",

Is there a more friendly camera setup that is better and/or easier for the type of freeze frame photography I want to do?",

            "Hey everyone! I own a Canon R5 and R7. I'm wanting to get my first speedlight for the R5, mainly. But it'd be nice if i could use it with the 7 on occasion. One issue I seem to be seeing a lot, is that apparently 3rd party flashes don't work in both HSS and TTL modes simultaneously. I'm wondering if this is as big a hindrance as people make it out to be? My other option of course is to go first party canon, but i'm not seeing many options from them for off camera flashes. Ideally, i'd like one I can use off camera, with a trigger on my hotshoe, that I could eventually add a strobe to as well in the system. Something I can really grow with. Godox seems to check all those boxes nicely, and yet the HSS/TTL simultaneously issue is definitely there from what i've read. So, should I just be happy with an on-camera flash from Canon? Or should I go with Godox and get access to a much larger system?     \n\n\n\nRoo",

            "My birthday is coming up and I have always wanted a camera, so I looked on the internet and found 2 cameras that are often mentioned as THE entry level cameras. The first would be the Canon eos 2000d and the 2nd would be the Nikon d3300. As we do not have a big budget, I will have to buy my camera second hand. I looked at sample pictures and was blown away by the d3300, but it often only costs 200-250 euros used. So my questions are: 1: is the d3300 a good choice or is the 2000d better? 2. is it ok to buy it used and what should I look for when buying a used camera? 3: If I were to buy a camera, what lens should I use if I want to photograph people and nature?

A few cosmetic issues don't matter on a camera body.

I'm really talking about details here",
            "The last instance was that the shots were very grainy, but I learned this was due to too high of an ISO, but switching to auto caused it to be way too dark. And since these were very much \"in the moment\" shots getting skaters to do tricks again wasn't an option so I had to adjust on the fly (it was also dusk so light constantly changing was annoying).   \nAnother seems to be just an experience issue since the R50 has a ton of options that I perhaps won't use for a while, if ever. Manual mode is my default for aperture and speed. But there is also aperture priority, shutter priority, programs, auto AI subject detection, and more.   \nThe last camera that a really used was a Pentax K1000, which was comparatively simple and I was pleased with all my shots from it.  \nThe more I think about it its perhaps down to me just understanding the photo triangle of iso/speed/f-stop better, and adjusting for conditions. But if there is a digital camera that is more streamlined without all the extras it may not feel so overwhelming.   \nIs there a digital equivalent to the K1000?",
            "Yes indeed, check this out: [Godox issues with the R5 are only if TTL and HSS are used at the same time, right?: Canon EOS R Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review (dpreview.com)](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4601160)\n\n  \nAgain - i'm brand new to flashes so I may not grasp all of this fully. Seems like a great flash, just want to make sure it's not fundamentally flawed.",
            "I meant like zoom in while still the image being HD and not blurry. My phone is a Galaxy A53 5G so not sure if this qualifies as new. Would prefer something better for cameras",
            "Yes. I was thinking that might be an option. Re the samyang. But wasn't sure where to start with specific models. Then focusing might be something to consider. Maybe have to look at follow focus for my gimbal. (A lot of camera movement in the work in question)\n\nYes. A lot of people saying the RF 16/2.8 is a bit poor for autofocus speed and corner image quality. (Probably not a major issue for me) I just want a lot of detail and a wee bit shallow DOF.",
            "thank you sir",
            "would you recommend an sony a6000 if i would have the chance to get one with lense for 330?",
            "Yeah, I thought that was just the fence or parts of leaves.  It is quite difficult to see and could almost be JPEG artifacts or PDAF points showing through.\n\nIf you have doubts, I would not purchase it but perhaps if you had a high res raw file you could check it better.",
            "The adapter doesn't change the optical qualities of the lens, and both are fairly similar kit lenses.",
            "If you can grab some cheap lenses second hand then that would work.\n\nIt is a basic camera but use what he has is best.",
            "I'm making photos of People on events in bad ligh that's why I'm thinking about full frame bit used",
            "I would not use manual mode except in circumstances where you don't want the exposure changing.  Auto ISO mode would probably work best there with a limited range of ISO.\n\nIf you are doing some more low light situations a wider aperture lens would work better.\n\nBut yeah practice makes perfect and all that.  Most cameras will be the same unless you like dials in which case Nikon and Fujifilm make models with those aplenty.",
            "Agreed, I wouldn't use manual mode for your use case, that's why you're getting issues when the light changes. Shooting action, esp outdoors, in manual can be really tough because several targets are moving at once.\n\nYou want an ISO and aperture that lets you get your highest shutter speed and least noise possible. These are action shots so they'll need to be fast, but if they're outdoors in the daytime you will have a lot of latitude. \n\nYou can either use shutter priority mode and set it to something like 1/500 give or take to see if you're getting the exposure and motion isolation you need, and adjust the ISO if they're too dark, or the shutter if you're still getting motion blur. Or you can shoot in Aperture priority mode at something pretty wide open like 4.5 and see if you're getting an acceptable shutter speed to catch the action. You'll also get nice shallow-ish depth of field which helps with subject separation. (you probably know this but the \"priority\" in those modes really just means that that setting stays fixed and the other settings change based on what is needed for proper exposure.)\n\nI'd turn on subject detection so the camera is metering off of the skater and not the sky or whatever, so you can frame up the shots the way you want and not have to worry about moving your metering spot. Not familiar with that model so YMMV.\n\nYour camera and lens should definitely get you some great results, it's just a matter of making sure your settings are working for you. Good luck!",
            "Ah, interesting. So it's more about using TTL to set the power output, and not just using the TTL system (which is the system that also manages the HSS). I much prefer manual control over TTL by choice, for off-camera flash. I can wrap my head around it better that way, and it isn't automatically changing on me or doing anything unpredictable because it's only doing what I manually tell it to. So in the extremely rare instance I would ever want to use HSS, I'd be using it with manual control and I would not encounter those problems.",
            "thank you.",
            "Well, of course the 24-70mm won't be the same lens on the Sony as the R10 being full frame versus APS-C.  So if you need that focal lengths on full frame it would be 35-105mm.\n\nIt depends on what you need.  If you think the R10 long term won't have the lenses you need then of course you can change but remember that some advantages come with disadvantages like the low light advantage coming at a depth of field expense.   \n\nIf you have multiple people and you need a deeper depth of field, you will lose the low light advantage.",
            "Okay well in that case it sounds like id be fine with Godox! That's good news cause I will likely add a proper strobe at some point.",
            "I mean i need variable focal length I need lens to make photo when im close and when im far on the event",
            "Well, it is important you get the right lens, what if 70mm is too short?\n\nI assume you do not have the 18-150mm but only the 18-45mm and find it not long enough.",

My people skills aren\u2019t bad either, I\u2019m excitable to work with, positive, typically easygoing and fair. Oh and when people message me and ask my prices and I say \u201c200$ for full session\u201d which is typical for my area, maybe a bit.

Out for days in the pissing rain sometimes, multiple days spent recording footage and editing only for the YouTube algorithm to give you 200 views and call it a day. Meanwhile, the most vacuous narcisstic bollocks imaginable gets frontpage.\n\nSocial media has destroyed things tbh. 90% of your time needs to be devoted to it and because of that most interactions are disingenuous and fake.\n\nI've since gone back to photography, which is way less stressful than video - but I'm not worrying about any kind outreach or anything. I might just store photos of general life for decades and try and pay for my retirement with photobooks in a few decades.",
            "I'm pretty sure a lot of commercial photographers are feeling the same pressure. The market has changed a lot in the last decade. That's why I never recommend anyone here to pursue a full-time career in photography without years worth of portfolio and a pretty decent client base as a start, or spend time and money studying it in school because it's just not worth it (useless degree). I tell them to treat it like a hobby or side hustle and build up from there. I've seen so many people fail miserably in the last few years, going all-in only to realize it's not as easy or great as they thought.\n\nThat's also why I chose not to pursue photography full-time. I keep it as a secondary income I don't need to rely on. I'm glad I went for a stable primary career in another field instead of diving all-in on photography. Less stress and some nice extra money coming in. Definitely recommended for those under constant stress in this field.\n\nMy DJ/musician friends are in the same boat. You need to be more of an influencer than a good musician/DJ/producer. You can be the best technically, but the ones with a bigger online presence (regardless of skill) are the ones getting booked big-time. So it's not just the art market suffering from this.",

Also bugs me how most don\u2019t care about the actual photography and just want to save a quick buck. Like, go to Wal mart and get your photos done then, because a real photographer is going to take care, time, attention and detail to your shoot - that\u2019s why we price ourselves the way we do. The amount I get ghosted once I say my prices is nuts.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily bad to want to be an influencer or have a large social media presence. I just think I\u2019m tired of it and maybe it\u2019s not for this introvert.",
            "If you are intent on making this as a business, then you may want to look at some kind of marketing and branding company that could help differienciat you from others. Obviously, this will cost money, so you will have to do some math to decide if that would be worth the cost. I would reach out to other photographers as well and see if they can provide guidance. I know most are highly competitive, but they can also be supportive if you find the right people. As with any business there is a risk of loss, money spent for no gain. So weigh that carefully.",

Not sure anyone has the patience for reading anymore mind you.",
            "Well, if it\u2019s work it\u2019s work. I prefer to keep photography as a hobby.",
            "Do you happen to be ADHD? It\u2019s sometimes a common theme for us. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut seriously, no shame. Though, if this happens often, try to buy things used so you can sell them used at less of a loss. (Like buy a used camera rather than new, used lenses, used woodworking equipment, etc)\n\nFunny you say that about watercolor - we\u2019ve been photographers here for 18+ years and are now starting to go into art. We\u2019ll see if it goes anywhere. \ud83d\ude05",
            "If I can offer a different take, portrait photography is one of the most oversaturated markets and some of the most talented photographers I know don't book for shit, despite trying.  As a portrait photographer, you're competing not with just other portrait photographers, but agencies using freelancers, companies with in house photographers.  The scaling up into a full-time career is incredibly hard.\n\nIf you really want to do this for the long run, you need to branch out.  Specialize down the line, when you can afford to.\n\nWhile I have and sometimes do still do portrait shoots, and it's where I started my photography journey, finding a niche or more robust market is significantly more effective.\n\nESPECIALLY on social media, 10 years ago Instagram was oversaturated by incredible work that I couldn't possibly hope to break into that market as a full-time career.  I'd be competing with award winning photographers no matter what city I live in.\n\nKeep your passion for portraits, keep pushing it, but look elsewhere for work.  Video is great, but it takes a lot of work (beyond buy a gimbal and a drone) to be good at. \n\nConstruction clients are abundant, generally have a lot of budget, have regular work, and sure, they can be a little bit difficult with scheduling but are in my experience pretty ideal clients.  It also opens up some really cool photo opportunities you'd never otherwise get, and some neat creative challenges.\n\n  That is a large focus of my business now, small/medium and local construction.  The word-of-mouth opportunity is massive here.  Every company has to work with a dozen other, and if you do well by one, they'll put your name forward.\n\nAlso, don't buy all the kit you think you'll need straight away.  Get what you need to start, a good lens or two, I personally think a good fixed-aperture zoom lens is the perfect starting lens.  24-70 2.8 gives you all the critical focal lengths at a good aperture.\n\nBeyond that, rent stuff and *only* when you need it.  Drop $50 on a lens rental for the weekend, and have that rental cost as part of your rate.\n\nI started my career making videos and taking photos of my friends, especially the ones with niche interests.  A lot of us trained parkour, so sports photography came in.  Then I had friends who rode motorbikes.  Then I had a partner in the animal world, and met some people she knew, came out to events, filmed or took photos at my own expense, got their attention, networked in.  As soon as people saw what I could make for them without being paid, they wanted some work done.  Then I got a job working with a former military dog handler, then all of a sudden I've had half a dozen ex-military clients all with their own business.\n\n90% of this job is networking, and that is not to say social media.  Small and local businesses show incredible loyalty if you also take care of them.  I see so many people talk in this sub about charging $1k a day baseline, not showing up for less than $2k blah blah... Really that is bullshit.  Not every photographer is a $2000 a day photographer.  I've been doing photography and videography for a career for 10+ years and I've never charged over $1000 for a day of photography alone.  Video? Yeah, I have significantly more equipment, physical toll on my body and risk factor to account for.\n\nI know everyone harps on about your personal brand being important to your business, but honestly, it's not the seller and if it's burning you out, just don't do it.  The last 5 years running my own business, I've not bothered.  I made a comfortable living with plenty to spend on my hobbies and social life until my weekly cost of living double in the last 2 years.  Equipment costs considered, I made a bit below the mean income, but I also work 3-4 days a week by choice, and not always full days, and have a great work/life balance.  That balance is 100% of the reason I still do this as a career.\n\nPortrait photography is by far the most fun and can be incredibly rewarding, but it's just not as viable as it's made out to be.\n\nIf you're keen on weddings, family photos can be done relatively fast (and should be with kids, max 30 minutes under 10) and can make you some really good money.  You don't have to do studio stuff, candid is always great.\n\nAnd if you just want some comfort, in my 10 years I've felt how you feel MANY many times.  It gets better.  Keep your chin up, I hope things work out for you",

            "Yeah I\u2019ve already spent thousands on this. Which, it\u2019s really just turning out to be an expensive hobby. I\u2019m booked for a couple weddings yes. Some would say I\u2019m successful for when I started this up. But my bank account currently says otherwise. I do not have the money to dump more money into this currently. My last 2,000 laptop that I needed to edit photos I\u2019m still paying off.",
            "I\u2019d read, I feel a lot of bloggers will also use AI to get ahead though \ud83d\ude1e",
            "I\u2019m not sure if I am - I have a LOT of the traits of ADHD and it runs in my family, but there are also a lot of traits I don\u2019t have . My sister is 100% adhd. Me I\u2019m not sure. Maybe. Art is fun! I find it hard to stay motivated",
            "So a photography business is something like 80-90% running a business and 10-20% doing photography is something I was once told. If you still have another job, it might be okay to stop spending any additional money on photography for awhile, keep the gigs you have and then ramp down for a bit until you get yourself financially in the black. I only know a few pros locally that have managed this full time, but they were always 3-6 months away from bankruptcy. The others are semi pro, and have a full time day job and a spouse with another job. When you have time, find some books or courses on just running a small business. I once read the average life of a wedding photographer is two years.",
            "Why did you need such an expensive laptop?",
            "Yeah, but that's mostly for SEO clickbait nonsense. Ironically AI search results will kill off most of those rubbish listicle type content. \n\nI genuinely believe that eventually, the over saturation of automated content will drive people back to longform stuff that requires a human touch. I hope anyway, because there's only so long I can stomach videos of dancing in their bedrooms with captions telling me their age, lol.",
            "Because I didn\u2019t want to get a cheap one and have to upgrade in a couple years, I wanted one that can run Photoshop as well as if I ever want to dabble in video, and my old laptop was so slow I wanted to make damn well sure my new one was going to be able to have the specs to get my jobs done without me having to wait minutes and crash whenever I used Photoshop..",
            "Is there a reason you had to have a laptop and not a desktop? Desktops will always be cheaper for a given processing power level than a laptop, and you probably could have gotten a similarly specced desktop for half the price of your laptop and had extra cash to get an ASUS Proart calibrated monitor to boot."

But my sister knew this was a service you offer to pay for hoping the big brother comes out and it happens for free lol. She was willing to pay me. I\u2019ve been paid for any family got I was requested to shoot. Family reunions.

It\u2019s not free for you, really it\u2019s at your expense when they ask you to do work for free. \n\nIf they agree to the family and friends rate, then your time is valued, and if they don\u2019t then you don\u2019t get overwhelmed.",
            "I just say no",
            "Just tell 'em you'll text them your rates. And then text them your rates. Sound simple? Yeppers. Because it is.\n\nAnd remember to get paid upfront. (Because working on spec (speculation) is just soooo wrong!) And make them sign contracts about what they're getting and for how much. And use this symbol: \u00a9.\n\nBe firm. And always smile when you tell them, \"Thank you.\"",
            "I learned early on that shooting kids killed my creativity !! It takes more patience than sports or journalism\n\nI will do a family wedding for sure - family Christmas Pic sure  - their kids baseball game - ONLY with my phone Never with a camera\n\nThose are my rules and my family understands",
            "Don\u2019t let anyone take up your time for free. You\u2019re the one who shoots and edits. It\u2019s no IG filter.  Tell them your price and decline anything less. Keep you focus on your art and editing skills. You deserve to be paid for shooting a whole event.",
            "Find something they do, or go for lunch and everytime tell them it's on them for free haha",
            "there is an old adage...never work with family or friends. Having done that a few times, I've learnt it is a good idea to listen to. Now when I'm asked I just explain how it's gone wrong in the past and I don't want to go through that again and possibly damage a relationship.",
            "A few ideas.\n1. Limit the time you spend on family/friends to 1-2 every week, or every other week and make them respect that schedule. If your \"booked\" they have to wait \n\n2. Make them earn their sessions by promoting. Bring me a paid gig, get your session for free/discounted. I have told people you get this price, but anyone that asks you pays THAT price. \n\n3. Make them.take the pics that you want to take. Whatever gaps in your portfolio, make them the guinea pig models. They get free pics out of it.\n\n4. Lunch/dinner, transportation/gas is ALWAYS on them. They won't pay for pics, make them pay for something.",
            "Either just say you don't do work for friends and family for free because it would understandably open the floodgates and you don't want to make anyone feel bad. Leave it at that if you want, but you could also just have a friends and family discount, but that's assuming you'd want them as clients.",
            "Take the photos, and then don't find the time to develop em?",
            "Just say fuck no",
            "Just say \"Thank you, but I can't do it\"",
            "I do it for free (as i'm not a professional) but on my terms. I bust out my RB67 (usually with HP5 or Delta 400), tripod, light meter, cable releases and everything, and start taking notes on the setup. 5 frames, 2 missed focuses and 40 minutes later they usually get really impatient  to the point they look pissed in the photos - which they  see one month later for the first time. Usually they don't ask for it again and I have to find another victim for my hobby.",
            "While I do love taking pictures, a photography session is  physically taxing, uses expensive equipment, and requires a high degree of skill. As my family/friend, you can obviously see the artistic value of my skills. However, when you ask me to offer you free service, I feel that you do not respect me or my photography business. We could discuss what you are looking for, and see if we can't find an agreeable price-point for us both.",
            "Ok so politely form an oh shape with your mouth and then say the word \u201c no.\u201d Your feelings of guilt will dissipate with practice. The more guilt, the more people will try to take advantage of you.",
            "Here's what i've done \n\nThem ; Could you take some pictures for us during family event? \n\nMe ; Sure, i tend to take ( pick your amount ), but since you're a friend/family i'll give you a discount!\n\nThem ; Oh, ok, i was hoping you'd do it for free since we're friends/family ( both have asked me )\n\nMe ; I get that, but if i'm gonna spend a few hours out of my day to take pictures, scroll through lots of photos, edit them and so on i want compensation for it, if you're not interested in paying then im sure guests can just send you ones they've taken with their phone?\n\nThem ; Thats a bit rude though...\n\nMe ; Not at all, it might not seem like much work to you, but there's a good reason you asked me, cause i've bought proper cameras, i capture moments for you that you might miss out on, i'd say thats worth the price, wouldn't you agree?\n\nI'll admit that its a bit assholish of me perhaps, but im personally tired of the \" for free \" requests i've gotten earlier, i don't take much for family gatherings or a birthday party, i put in alot of work into my pictures and i take pride into what i do, if you ( friend or family ) can generate the same pictures i can from your iPhone or samsung then there isn't a reason to ask me now is it.",
            "You can't say no.\n\nJust keep taking pics free, and make them look crap.",
            "Ask if they pay their bills by working for free.",
            "Offer them a 5% friends and family discount and walk away",
            "Ask them to do their job for you, for free.",
            "Tell them you've become interested in figure studies and want to hone your skills if they're interested in posing nude..",
            "Ass, grass, or gas is my standard reply.\n\n/s",
            "\"No, sorry. I only do paid work. You can hire me if you'd like, but I no longer work for free. Nor do I do discounted rates anymore.\"\n\nThen if they still try to pressure you, tell them you wouldn't expect them to do free work for you, you would pay them.",
            "\u2018No\u2019 is a complete sentence.",
            "> If the issue is pushed then I ask for a trade for something they wouldn\u2019t want to do for free. Oh free pics, yea I could use some plumbing work Frank. Free pics, hell yea as long as you got me on a set of tires from the shop?\n\nBe careful with this, though. It's very possible for you to get a \"yes.\" You may even get the short end of the stick if you don't have a ballpark on the cost of a handyman for the chore you want done.",
            "My tack when people I know ask me to shoot their wedding, presumably for free, is to say something like, \u201cI\u2019d rather join in the celebration of your special day than to spend it working.\u201d",
            "Received an email from my niece telling me how much she and her fianc\u00e9 would love me and my wife to share their wedding day. Oh, and we know what a wonderful photographer you are so it would be great if you could photograph the wedding day. \n\nTold her that I wasn\u2019t good enough to do a wedding and they should book a professional. Pointed out the potential pitfalls of expecting an amateur to do a professional job on their special day. \n\nHeard nothing back and never received a wedding invitation. Then exactly the same scenario happened with another niece. \n\nGuess I\u2019m not the favourite uncle after all.",
            "Agree with this. Or that you don\u2019t like posed/ semi-posed photography.",

            "I mainly do wildlife and landscape photography so I tell people that taking photo of people and event is not really in my skill set and I would not do a good job and enjoy it.  I also let them know just how much work the post-processing is for photography.",
            "This is probably good advice.\n\nThe guitarist in my band played the wedding of his friend\u2019s daughter with his old band many years ago. A delayed arrival due to a broken down van and some equipment issues onstage led to a disastrous gig, and the friend hasn\u2019t spoken to him since.",
            "I don't have luck with those conversations  - customers understand this But family seems to think it's just pulling the trigger\n\nIf they aren't creative then the conversation will make you seem \"sensitive\"\n\nI'm a blue collar guy - that's my experience \n\nI tell family I will do weddings for them - the rest is subject to my whims - Whims Only \ud83d\ude01\n\nGood luck out there traveler",
