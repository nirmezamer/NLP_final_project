            "Hey! I'm new to card collecting and was just wondering what the best and ideal way to protect cards is. I don't really know what I'm doing so I just throw every new card to my collection into a penny and dragonsleeve. Should I get plastic toploaders for valuable cards? Is a binder a good idea?\n\nI care about protecting cards for display and collecting, I don't care about their future value. I just want them to be nice and pristine so they look good.",
            "Hello, I'm looking to buy a PSA10 Umbreon Vmax alt art from Ebay and was wondering, if anyone has experiece purchasing more expensive stuff there? Am I covered by money back guarantee in case i recieve a fake one? Somewhere I've read they authenticate the card before shipping, but can't find any more info on that. The seller has a 100% positive feedback, with 700 items sold. But I'm a bit sceptical cause the cert. number on the slab has been blacked out. This is the listing im reffering to. Any info is highly appreciated.",
            "General Question/ how do people deal with scammers? Do you call them out on being one, or ghost them? \nI put up an ISO post on FB, and a guy messaged me saying he had the card I was looking for. He sent a picture from an eBay listing\u2026 I asked for a timestamp and a couple hours later, he sent what looks like a slightly zoomed in photo of the same thing, with a photoshopped piece of paper with name/date. It literally has the same dust spots/background as the OG photo just slightly zoomed it and then slightly out of focus. He\u2019s also asking Half the price of the eBay listing (big red flag).",
            "How \"valid\" or \"reputable\" is the grading service via Carmarket?\n\nI know PSA and the likes seems to be on top just due to being on the market for a log time and made themselves a name, but for me, living in the middle of Europe, a \"local\" grading service would be much better imo.",

We recently discovered Collectors Cardhouse which is bloody amazing, but it's just so far from us and we're never in that area. Would love to know about more shops like that around London.",
            "How exactly does grading work? I understand you have to send it in to psa, but the flat cost is per card or per package?

            "Hey all. I pulled Magikarp - 203/193 from Paldea Evolved. \n\n  \nI want to get it graded, but I'm in South Africa, so grading is done by a 3rd party who sends it off on the local party's behalf. The cost is about $40.\n\n  \nIs this worth it? I see the value does increase substantially for a PSA 10. \n\n  \nAny dust is on the outside of the toploader.

            "Sounds like you're already double-sleeving, so you're off to a great start! I also use a perfect-fit dragon sleeve and a penny sleeve or equivalent.\n\nAs far as what's best, it boils down to mostly personal preference. I prefer the ease of using a binder and just double-sleeving, but some collectors will keep their cards organized outside a binder in top-loaders or magnetic cases.\n\nFor binders, avoid 3-ring binders; they can cause your cards damage. I use a [TopDeck Binder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081W1L6FL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1), but anything similar to this will do. They also make specialty binders that can hold graded cards/top-loaders/magnetic cases.\n\nAnd with binders, always store them vertically and not horizontally on top of each other. You want to make sure you're not adding any unnecessary weight on top of your binder. \n\n  \nAnd lastly, whatever storage method you use, make sure your cards are kept out of direct sunlight! The sun will bleach your cards.",

            "I would start off with checking prices on tcg player or PriceCharting the app or maybe even alt the app. Then consider psa grading because it\u2019s what people \u201cknow\u201d however they up charge a ton and are in and out constant scandals. If that isn\u2019t up your alley then consider csg. If you think you have a strong ten contender then go for Bennett grading. However, if you want to take out the \u201chuman\u201d aspect and biases I would do AGS and have artificial intelligence grade you r cards",

            "Its unfortunate. People are coordinating buyouts for cards to stoke FOMO and cause the prices to skyrocket as a result and its working. Its so obvious too because every price chart has a large spike around the same date",
            "Keep in mind that Japanese equivalents are easier to pull since each booster box comes with 3 ARs.",
            "Let\u2019s use an example of an older card. Psa 10 gold star gyrados in Japanese goes for 2200$-2800$. The same card in English sells for 13,000$-17,000$. English is just more desireable. If you\u2019re buying for art get Japanese, just don\u2019t expect the same value later(excluding Japanese specific promos)",
            "It\u2019s because Japanese art rares are seeded lol. It is much easier to pull art rares in Japanese than in English cause you\u2019re guaranteed several per box. Japanese art rares won\u2019t hold the same value as the English counterparts because of this. English is the way to go if you want art rares that will have a higher value ceiling. Japanese is the way if you just want the art for your collection without paying the premium.",
            "Why do you have to offend 90% of sub like that?",
            "I think a large part is the yen is doing so bad with japans economy. I only get japaneee cards now. I think when there economy recovers  the cards will also jump in price\u2026.i also think Japanese cards just look better.",
            "Prices have actually been coming down/correcting",
            "Yeah if I'm buying a full art, I'm buying it for the art. On japanese cards, the text is less blocky and covers significantly less of the art, as well as being cheaper and being of higher quality. I give 0 shits about my modern collection being worth money down the road, cause I only get 1 of each of the cards I like, and I'm never selling \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\nI'm totally fine with the market the way it is, I snagged this card and the groudon for like $2 each a month ago and have enjoyed looking at them in my binder while I spend my big money on vintage :)",
            "This is just a fundamental lack of knowledge about how Japanese and English differ:\n\nJapanese boxes have minimum guarantees. This is why almost every single Japanese AR is only around $2-$3, because you\u2019re literally guaranteed to get 3 of them per box. There is no guarantee in English.\n\nNot only that, but Japanese sets are (usually) only half the size of English sets. In this case, we are talking about Japanese Clay Burst, which combined with Japanese Triplet Beat to create English Paldea Evolved. This means that there is a much smaller pool of cards to pull from. (According to another comment here since I\u2019m too lazy to look it up,) there are 12 total AR\u2019s in Clay Burst. This means in every clay burst box, you have a 3/12 or 1/4 chance to pull this tyranitar (provided no dupes).\n\nIn English, the pull rate for this tyranitar is 1/480.\n\nClay burst boxes are also only about $35-$45, for 30 packs with 5 cards per pack.",
            "Seriously. It took 3 years for SWSH and being out of print before prices went up but S&V which everyone hated until a month ago, having been released only a year and still in print suddenly goes up too? Somethings definitely afoot in the English market",

            "japanese is always cheeper because the market for japanese cards is much much smaller. like just ask yourself how many people in the world speak english vs japanese, english is such a wide spread language that the country with the most english speakers in it is china and japan has english classes in its public school system.",

Like, the demand for English is so much greater than Japanese it\u2019s not even comparable. 151 JP went from $170 a box all the way down to $60 a box recently with a reprint. A booster box of the Japanese set the TTAR is from is like $30, lol.",

            "I agree, which is why I\u2019m loading up on Japanese 151 and a few other sets. Also buying single cards that I really like",
            "The reason it\u2019s more expensive in English because of how shit the Quality Control is, yes in Japan you get guaranteed hits and the quality is much better. In the US you have to go through so much garbage before you get an actual good looking card that won\u2019t have a print line or be off center that any card without either is automatically valued higher",
            "I've been buying evolving skies alts in Japanese lately because they're cheaper it's mad",
            "Do you know why? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid at all. Your guaranteed hits from Japanese booster box\u2019s. In English your not. There also printed a lot less in English and printed way more in Japanese.",
            "Even though you get 3 per box, there are still 12 to collect and you'd probably still have to buy more than 4 boxes to make the 12 card set. It just seems to me like Japanese ARs will be priced much higher in the future, but then again I don't have sales records or know how many cards were printed.",
            "I\u2019ve got so many Japanese versions of AR cards that are ridiculous in English. This Tyranitar, Groudon from raging surf/paradox rift, Magikarp from triple beat/paldea evolved are just some examples",

            "I'm feeling the same with Digimon prices here in Brazil...",
            "Well that\u2019s not a fair comparison. Same card, yes, but the language makes a huge difference to a majority of people here in the US. You\u2019re also guaranteed 3 Art Rares per booster box. \n\n$35 MSRP for a Japanese booster with a guaranteed hit rate of 3/20 packs for an AR vs $165 MSRP for an English booster box with an average of 1/13 hit rate for an IR means some cards are going to be expensive in English and most will be very cheap in Japanese. \n\nEven taking the average market price of an English booster box into account, you still get 3 times as many ARs than IRs for every dollar you spend.\n\nI love collecting Japanese cards but I wouldn\u2019t say you found a steal or anything, you just paid average market price for those Japanese card. If you don\u2019t mind the language, great. But unfortunately many folks do mind and there are just so many more of them that $4.50 is a fair price for that card.",

            "Same! I get all ARs from Japan instead of English IR. Pretty big price difference, and all I care about is the art anyway",

It\u2019s funny cause in the reselling circles these guys are buying so much Japanese product rn and reselling it to the same people claiming the English market is being tampered with.

It\u2019s just one of those pokemon that are more sought after in English like how zards tend to be a bit more expensive in English as well.

It\u2019s been many people\u2019s favourite set and the chase for the PSA 10 magikarp has dwindled supply. Because supply has dwindled, people are having FOMO about the product and in turn the market is naturally having the cheaper stock sold out in both singles and sealed. This is why there is a huge spike for all singles and sealed during that time, there is now a retrace because the market is trying to find the new normal. \n\nWill there be a reprint? More than likely. So prices will go down again before the market eats up the new supply and the same thing happens again.",

            "I missed out on the Neo sets 20 years ago and I would love to collect them, but with the current prices its out of reach. I dont need 1st ed or even need it to be in English. I just want the images, so I'll likely build my own Neo sets from Japanese cards, but in English set order. Its far cheaper, and I no longer give a damn about hyper inflated card prices for newer sets or even the perceived value of my vintage collection. Its all going to my daughter one day anyways. I'd be fine with prices tanking, just so I can have the images I want without paying $100+ USD for a piece of nostalgia made from cardboard.",
            "That might be true for mid era but it\u2019s not for everything Japanese. Go take a look at the prices of the original gold stars from Dragon Frontiers or any vintage shiny cards. The high end Japanese market has very deep pockets.",
            "Value goes up just not like the English does. Something about reading the cards makes it more expensive",
            "I agree.  This I think is the main reason as well. Also the chances of getting a particular art rare is higher since Japanese sets are smaller and English sets are made up of 2-3 Japanese sets (except for special sets like 151).",
            "Your argument is valid, same thing with Jolteon/Vaporeon/Flareon VMAX promo box (english) vs contest counterparts (japanese).\n\nReally kinda depend on \u201crarity\u201d but my argument for Tyranitar and other ARs is these cards would be print to death at least for years so English version of these cards have no qualms being that high at this point of their lifespan.",
            "This is also why things like full art trainers in Japanese can be quite expansive compared to the English copies, they are in the secret rare slot which are one per booster box but can be anything from regular full arts to alt arts/gold rare.",
            "I find it interesting that typically there are quite a bigger percentage of English PSA 10s compared to Japanese PSA 10s. I\u2019m wondering if this will affect any shift in value from English to Japanese",
            "english also guarantees ARs in their booster boxes. It\u2019s just that the english have been manipulated heavily",
            "It\u2019s true the market is dumb, you just have to respect his opinion",
            "With Japanese being the OG language, I like to think that the artwork was meant to be displayed with Japanese characters.",

            "Sorry for the stupid question (only collecting for about 2 weeks), but don't JP cards go out of print quicker thus the scale balances slightly?",
            "You're telling me higher supply + lower demand = cheaper card? But everyone here keeps telling me it's market manipulation?!? How could that be???",
            "The pull rates are also a lot harder",
            "With one very minor exception, if you can prove your country of residence (aka current address) is Japan and participating in an International Tournament then you are allowed to use Japanese cards but may require permission from the TO to do so. For Special Events and Regionals it is not typically allowed but some exceptions have occurred depending on TO. Some Japanese players go to TPCi events (i.e. Oceania) because Japanese tournaments tend to be invite only and invitations are based on placement in a Bo1 format.",
            "Pretty sure everyone buying Japanese cards are intending to collect.",

            "I remember when everyone was hyping up Japanese boxes it was ridiculous the prices they were reaching, glad its back to normal now.

It makes sense that English would be worth more, but not necessarily THIS much more, at least not this early when the sets are still readily available (though I can kinda understand the Magikarp because it is a unique and loved art style, coupled with the fact that paldea evolved has so many art rares that it dilutes the pull rates heavily).

So any assertion of \"gurantees\" or \"seeding\" is just speculation and, frankly, misinformation. \n\nYou've set up an argument where even if proven wrong, you can just claim it proves your point.
