You could show me a legit doppelganger with 99.9% likeness and it wouldn't create a single neuron reaction inside our minds at this point. \n\nIts also just an obvious side effect of too much binge watching... When its basically the only show you've watched for a whole week, everytime you see a skinny blonde man with a beard, your brain will obviously try to find an association with whats its been doing lately.

            "He seemed to have a hard time keeping it together during his story involving his mother and sister, when Luke gracefully offered to take over/change the topic. His heartbreak is clear for whoever has been lost, and it seems it may be his sister. They are still here through who he is.",

He doesn't want to be responsible for you giving him your last 5 bucks and now you can't eat for a day or can't get your cat some treats. Linus wants you to take care of yourself before you throw money at the screen.",

            "I mean, today is my first day off since Monday *last* week (and I technically worked today, since I worked an overnight shift), so I haven't even had time to watch last WAN. Was very surprised when I saw the notification.",
            "To be fair, it's not like that would have mattered given the WAN show's rep for starting at it.",
            "He didn't say you can't, he said he doesn't want it. He can't tell you how to spend your money, and you can't tell him how to value what he gets.\n\nLitteraly all he is saying is that he doesn't need the money, and doesn't look down on anyone who doesn't want to give. Basically you're mad at him for not thinking he is owed our money, even if we cant afford it.\n\nWhat i will say is that if you frivolously give away money, yet struggle to put food on the table, you're an idiot. Especially if your giving it to litteral multi-millionairs with porsches.",

            "I gather his one of his sisters passed away, that's rough.",
            "You have to remember that the WAN show is largely just a way for Linus and Luke to hang out and talk tech as friends, they just do it with an audience. I'm sure he actually appreciated the break from thinking about things that WAN would have given him.",
            "Sometimes you need a break in your own mind about grieving, work can help.\nputting off the grieving process too long would probably be worse in the long run",

            "If you\u2019re that poor there\u2019s probably still needs to be met when you get there. I\u2019ve been there, you can go a couple years without entertainment and fun if you have a plan.",

            "Lol your ego is so hurt.",
            "Platforms make the majority of their revenue from ads, not donations... And most pple can enjoy their creator's content without donating... Unless you're saying you get sole pleasure from just the act of donating? If that's the case, then, heck dude, give your money to me instead lol",

            "For a long time my entertainment budget was in the same ballpark - the difference was I saved up the budget for bigger stuff that could last me longer than subscription.\n\n\nTo this day a subscription or transient purchase is too much of a luxury for me - YouTube premium being the only one I have that's for entertainment.\n\n\n\nAnd spending on LTT has always been an extravagant deal for me.",
            "dude he wasn't. he just said he doesn't want you to give your money to him. never said not to give to it to other streamers or anyone else. i saw in a earlier comment you would subscribe to floatplane for bit, much better use of your money for the value if you enjoy the content.
