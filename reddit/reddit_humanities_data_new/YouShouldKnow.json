        "content": "Up until now we have been pretty lenient in regards to Rule 2, which states that post must describe *why*  the YSK is useful. We have approved posts that didn\u2019t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple \u201c**Why YSK:**\u201d in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*\n\nRemember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.\n\n*BASICALLY:*\n\n* All posts must include a \"**Why YSK:**\" (typed just like that) section in the text body.\n\n\\[\\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r/YouShouldKnow](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes. If you feel your  post needs to include one, a brief anecdote is fine. The entire (nor the majority of the) post should not be about your own personal experience, however. We will be removing posts that are just personal anecdotes.\\]\\]\n\n**Why YSK:** We (the YouShouldKnow moderators) hope it will improve readers' abilities to better understand the purpose of the sub, mentioned above and in the expanded Rule 1. For thread creators, it will help in their ability to explain how the reader can improve upon a certain skill, task, or ability. It will also help the creator improve upon the skill of not having their post deleted due to not including \"**Why YSK**\" in the text body of their post.\n\n*NOTES:*\n\n* Bolding the words **Why YSK:** will make it a lot easier for people to find it.\n* Again, please put **Why YSK** in bold letters. It's easier to find in a sea of text.\n* **Why YSK** must be followed by an actual explanation as to how it helps someone improve upon a skill, task, or activity. Following it with a massive personal anecdote is not the point -- neither is following it with \"I think this is important\" or something similar.",

When adopting the Latin alphabet, the letter \"Y\" most closely resembled \"\u00fe,\" and so was used in its place. \n\nSo now, when you go to the Renaissance Faire, you can stop mispronouncing the word \"Ye\" and sounding like a clodpoll.\n\nEdit: I realize this sounds like I'm just being overly pedantic, and some have said it's not really \"wrong\" pronunciation, since language evolves, and since mostly everyone says it that way now, it should be considered correct. However, as u/MisterToothpaster pointed out, \"there's a difference when the word is used in an intentional attempt to sound old-fashioned.\" I agree with this statement.

        "content": "Why YSK: aquatic sports equipment and gear like wetsuits, surfboards and others, kayaks, paddles, life vests, and anything else that may come into contact with bodies of water (especially saltwater) should be thoroughly cleaned and dried after each use to avoid mold, rot, infestations, unpleasant odors, and saline corrosion overtime. \n\nProper cleaning of water sports equipment will ensure your gear stays in operable condition for much longer. Here are some upkeep tips for water equipment post-use:\n\nWaterwear: go back and forth agitating gear in fresh and soapy water until fresh water appears too cloudy to continue. Continue cycle with fresh soapy & clean water until it remains colorless after significant agitation. Hang wetsuits up to dry out of the sun. This will mean it dries slower, but proponged UV exposure over time may cause damage to the material. If you want it to dry quicker and don\u2019t mind this side effect, hang it in the sun. This goes for most waterwear.\n\nBoards: all surf, skim, wake, and windsurfing boards should be first rinsed off with fresh water. Lightly scrub the surface with a washcloth if there is excess gunk or seaweed. Make sure all sand and grime is off your equipment before storage. Hard top surfboards require wax on the top to provide grip, not soft tops. The board should be scraped off and rewaxed at the worst every year (in my experience) or once the wax gets damaged, naturally is scraped off, or loses its grip.\n\nKayaks & paddles: same thing as board cleaning, minus the scrubbing. After the rinse, open the kayak\u2019s drain plug and tip it to drain the water. Remove any debris from inside the kayak, as leaves will often collect around the plug and make it harder to drain. Leave them to dry naturally in a cool space out of the sun. Avoid that UV! It can lead to the material getting sun bleached.",

If someone is trying to get into an industry with a high bar for entry, I imagine an unpaid internship could be incredibly useful compared to no internship at all. Whereas if someone is doing an internship in an industry that has less barriers for entry, whether the candidates ever did an internship at all likely has little to no impact on job offers.

I'm not, but I wanted to make the point that, 1. The person you're replying to is not wrong and 2. 1.8% return is not necessarily bad, depending on the frame in which you view it - or if no paid internships exist, and without presented other opportunity costs as a counter weight to this time investment, mathematically a person should do an unpaid internship.",

I still haven't read the research, but if they don't consider the quality of employment, even simply looking at income realized for both groups, it can be argued the findings misrepresent the value of the investment, or if your marginally more likely to be employed AND more likely to find improved quality employment, it's a no brainer to do an unpaid internship."

Most mass food is not grown or picked correctly, and they are also usually forced to \"ripen\" faster, which affects the taste and quality.

In this paper, a fusion non-destructive method for classifying watermelon sweetness based on acoustic signal and image processing techniques is proposed. Tapping sound signals, watermelon rind patterns, and weight are considered as features. The application of the three features is inspired by techniques that are used by famers to estimate watermelon maturity. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to develop sweetness classification models. Eight classification-based ML techniques are used: Na\u00efve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, Decision tree, Random forest, Artificial neural network, Logistic regression, Support vector machine, and Gradient boosted trees. The applied ML models are evaluated classification performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). The results show that the proposed method can reliably classify watermelon sweetness. The highest classification accuracy achieves 92%, obtained by Gradient boosted trees.",

I can't eat all of them or give them away at the same time, so this is also for the sake of not wasting any.\n\nIn regard to picking one in the store, it's fine to use all the different \"tricks\" together. A stronger \"field spot\", a lot of webbing, a lower pitch hollow sound when you thump, slightly sweet smell, and it doesn't feel like a solid rock when you squeeze it (just a tiny bit of give) are all helpful. Lacking any of these doesn't mean it won't be sweet, but the presence of these are strong positive signs. But also keep in mind those are only remotely helpful because it's assumed they're grown in a field (which I assume most are).\n\nIf it's not grown in a field, the visual tests won't work as well (thus doing all the test being more helpful). so OP isn't completely wrong, but there's more to it than what they're saying.

The whole way you're thinking about this seems wrong:\n\n> is sweet\n\n> has good texture \n\n> sometimes better\n\n> can be mealy\n\nThis isn't a good way to think about the issue at all. Are you keeping track of the numbers of which methods work or not? Are you grading the qualities you find best? Are you having a bite out of one with a yellow spot, and it's not as sweet or good as people think, and you conclude \"oh, yellow spots don't HAVE to be sweet\", while you ignore that most other such watermelons you tried were actually fine or even good? To what extent are light ones \"sometimes\" better? Are they USUALLY better? The counterexamples are way more likely to stick out in your mind, because they go against your expectation. And if you really tried thousands, there's no way you can draw a meaningful conclusion without rigorously tracking this shit. Unless every method gave a completely mediocre watermelon, every single time, the same as randomly picking. And humans are notoriously wrong about their intuitions regarding randomness. \n\nI'm pretty sure most ordinary watermelon enjoyers are not out there claiming that their method(s) are perfect and they pick out the best watermelon every time, as some other idiot in the comments thought. They're just trying their best to improve their odds. And the way you talk about the situation tells me you're not thinking about odds at all. You're not even thinking about grading things on a scale. It's not as simple as this one \"is sweet\" and another \"isn't sweet\". Miss me with that binary ass thinking.\n\nEnough peeps have validated this in the thread without (IMO) specifying why you're wrong precisely. You're right in that the methods aren't perfect. But of fucking course they're not. You're wrong to think they would be in the first place. And you're wrong that the methods aren't gonna help someone improve their chances to have their specific preferences met.\n\nFucking scientific education is lacking these days. \n\nBtw this comment is at least 20% a joke. But it's at least 60% serious too. Yes, I picked those numbers out of my ass.\n\nEdit: alrighty I gotta chill, perhaps I was being too harsh....",
            "Tendril size - and node size - is genetically determined.  Watermelon vines can grow up to 40 feet long - and I have grown some that were 40 ft!  Tendrils permit a vine to climb.  I've had decent size watermelons produced 10 feet up in an apple tree.  If a tendril does not attach to something it can climb, it curls into tight and convoluted corkscrews.  So short version, tendril size has zero to do with sweetness.  BUT that is not the end of the story.  Sweetness is highly correlated with vine size where a larger vine tends to produce sweeter watermelons and where fewer watermelons on a vine will be much sweeter than a vine that is overloaded.  I grow open pollinated varieties specifically selected for very sweet fruit.  My seed crop this year is Wilson Sweet.  In years past, I've grown Yellow Moon & Stars, Ledmon, Wibb, Bradford, Congo, Jubilee, Dixielee, and dozens of others.  Some commercial hybrids are selected for sweetness.  Look up watermelon brix if you want to read some of the research about very sweet watermelons.  Now a caution, seedless watermelons are roughly half of the market in the U.S.  Unfortunately, seedless fruit tend to be less sweet by far than seeded watermelons.  Breeders are working on this so maybe in future we will have very sweet seedless watermelons.\n\nFun fact, watermelons occasionally produce natural triploid seed which will grow into a plant that makes seedless fruit.  I grew one last year which made 3 entirely seedless watermelons.  Breeders exploit this by producing tetraploid watermelons which are crossed with normal diploid varieties to produce triploid seedless varietes.",

            "Presumably, you didn't test \"thiiiis\" otherwise you would have mentioned it. Meaning you haven't actually ruled it out as a good indicator.\n\n\nAlso, knocking on melons is a pretty common practice, so not sure why you got snarky about it.",
            "Does this rule only count for red meat watermelon, or can it be applied to yellow as well? \n\nWhat's better, seeds or seedless?",

            "Also taught to pick hollow-sounding ones and it hasn't failed me. For melons, it's by how melon-y it smells - the more, the better.",
            "The best way to tell is from the vine, which really doesn't help most people. The tendril will have started to die, which indicates the plant is ready to eat, where developing ones will still have a green tendril.\n\nThe yellowness on the bottom usually indicates the fruit spent a good time developing. Webbing can be an indicator. If the stem is still on the melon, it was picked too early. The skin becomes a bit more dull and dark compared to ones still growing, but I am hypersensitive to sensory perception and this is something I have found most people don't have an eye for. If you have a good sense of smell, you will be able to smell more of a watermelon flavor from the spot where the fruit used to be on the vine. If you train your ear, riper melons tend to make more of a thunk sound, which indicates it has a lot of juice and is full.\n\nOn the farm you had to be trained to pick melons, as the owner did free returns or money back if your melon you bought wasn't ripe and full. The best indicators are seeing death on the vine, a yellow bottom, the color of the skin (more dull and dark, which again, most people might not have an eye for) and webbing was bonus points. All of the other tips help increase your chances.\n\nSo, again, most produce isn't picked correctly, so shopping local or when a fruit would be in season for your area would strengthen your chances of a good fruit.\n\nEdit: Realized I mentioned tomatoes so figured I'd elaborate. Tomatoes grown for mass consumption are typically picked too early and are forced to ripen. This takes away most of the flavor. If growing tomatoes, so long as the bottom has started to turn red, pick it from the plant. Put it on a counter or shelf, not the fridge, and it will ripen and taste just as good as when it was completely ripe on the vine (will ripen over time). Refrigerating tomatoes, at any level of ripeness, will remove a lot of the flavoring due to some chemical reaction I do not remember at the moment. Removing a tomato when it first starts to turn red will allow the plant to give you a bigger yield, without sacrificing the quality of your fruit.",
