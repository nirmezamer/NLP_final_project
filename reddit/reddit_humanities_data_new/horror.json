            "Any recommendation of supernatural horror movie from middle east? I've already watched Under The Shadow, Dhabbe, Siccin.",
            "I watched Arcadia this week. Really enjoyed it, the monster design was really unique and creepy.\n\nAlso watched I Saw the TV Glow. I thought this was going to be more of a horror film than it is, it's really more of an artsy indie vibe exploring escapism and sexuality/gender dysphoria. Not particularly suspenseful but it is a great movie nonetheless.",
            "I saw infested a few days ago, it\u2019s about spiders taking over an apartment building. Honestly pretty solid movie 8.5/10",
            "The Outwaters - this is a found footag Blair Witch wanna be. A group of young folk go out into the desert and cosmic horror strikes. Watchable but weird pacing and barely a story.",
            "I just finished The Witch with Anya Taylor-Joy. Really enjoyed it! Much better than I expected, actually.",
            "I rewatched Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3. Part 2 has the best character of the series: Ginny, and I do wish that she appeared again. The rest of the film is pretty good, but standard. Part 3 I felt nothing, but it was pretty funny to see how cliched the film is. It is ultimately boring tho, which I knew going in, but people convinced me to watch it \"because it has the best final chase in the franchise\". It did not have the best final chase in the franchise.",
            "Anyone else watching the new British series, *Insomnia*? It was slow at first, but now I'm glad I stuck with it.\u00a0\n\n\nSynopsis:\n>Successful career woman Emma Averill fears that she is losing her mind as her hard-won lifelong dream begins to turn into a nightmare, forcing her to do everything she can to prevent it from collapsing around her.",
            "I watched Saw X and I somehow had high expectations, but more surprisingly it didn't disappoint. Tobin Bell was on screen most of the movie and that's probably the main reason. Minor gripes with minor spoilers:\n\n>!The villains would have been better off getting real jobs. For the amount of effort and the risk, plus the damage they were causing people, it was hard to believe that their scam could have been profitable enough to be worth it. Towards the end the main lady says that she's happy she won't have to split the cash now, she's got a bag of money and it would seem she never paid her associates. I was annoyed that she got the easiest game even though she was the mastermind of the scam.!<",
            "Be My Cat: A Film for Anne - really liked this. Small budget, docu style \"filmed\" by the main character. The writer/director is working on a trilogy and I look forward to watching those. It's just a fun time.\n\nGreat rec if you like Creep (the one with the videographer, not the subway one).",
            "I just watched a found footage movie called the butterfly kisses and I must say my mind was blown. A fairly unique concept around the whole premise of the found footage genre, and with the ambiguity and confusion created to divert the audience is great in the movie and the ending was well done too. Overall a soldi 9/10",
            "check out paranormal,,its a tv show..not very scary but the episodes are good",
            "I just looked up I Saw the TV Glow and I'm going to check it out. I had no idea Phoebe Bridgers was in it! Thanks for the tip!",

            "You get two different music performances in the film! Hers is very cool.",

            "I watched this a few days before release on Scream Unseen. It started promising but they really did drop the ball in the third act.",
            "Russell Crowe in another exorcism movie? Didn't I just see him on a vespa?",
            "This wasn't very good. Some story elements had potential, but the script never came together in a cohesive way. There was no tension to keep my attention. The actors did their best, but it wasn't enough to salvage this from being a slog. I'd reccommend skipping this one.",
            "This movie made 0 effort to tie anything together cohesively but had a few fun moments. It was not as bad as people are making it out to be if you can turn your brain off during it. The writer wanted to make a movie about alcoholism and used the demon possession stuff to represent how suppressing your feelings and trauma can affect the people around you. Predictable horror movie but worth a watch if you're bored.",
            "I thought the first half of the film was excellent. It wasn't clear what was going to happen, but it was genuinely scary for awhile (although it relied a bit more on jump scares and loud noises than I like). The music was really solid.\n\nI think leaning into the struggling alcoholic trope gave it a cool The Shining sort of vibe. I also liked the meta plot pointing at The Exorcist, which reminded me of Wes Craven's New Nightmare (which I thought was actually pretty scary, for a Nightmare on Elm Street movie).\n\nUnfortunately the plot didn't really pay off or go anywhere interesting. >!The characters didn't react to absurd situations in ways that made any sense (Russell Crowe bent over backwards in an impossible way and smashed his face into a table, then murdered someone, and they...sent him home with his teenager daughter?). I still don't understand the childhood trauma that happened to Russell Crowe either.!<\n\nStill better than The Pope's Exorcist.",
            "Pretty large pile of shit. \n\nLove some schlocky Russell Crowe (See The Pope's Exorcist or Land of Bad) but this was basically irredeemable, some baffling directing choices, very little actual horror. David Hyde Pierce is solid at least and the premise of Crowe's character is interesting but doesn't really pay off in a meaningful way. \n\n1.5/5",
            "I didn't realize that the director is Jason Miller's son (and Jason Patric's half brother).  That makes it a more interesting idea.",
            "It's been a while since I've seen a film this dull. Or this dark. Not in terms of tone. Just in terms of lighting. It's got a dark tone too. I think. Hard to tell. Couldn't really see what was happening on screen about 60% of the time. \n\nI want to blame it being so dull on the fact that it was just being a string of clich\u00e9s but I don't think that's the root cause. I mean, that's true-- this is a fully derivative film in every respect-- but so are lots of things and they're not as big of a drag as this film is. Scientists should study this, because it really was so dull that it almost crossed the line into being fascinatingly experimental in how phoned in and bland something could be and still technically qualify as a \"film\"... but then... it didn't.\n\nI wish the power of Christ had compelled the writer/director/producers to do something more interesting than this.",
            "Why did the priest sacrifice himself at the end?\n\nAnd who did Adrian Pasdar play?",
            "I love Russell Crowe movies, but this was pretty bad. A lot of the scenes\u00a0tried building tension, but almost every one of them just went on way too long and delivered little payoff.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPlus, while the ideas might have been interesting (filming an exorcist horror movie, main lead getting abused/molested[?] in childhood and consequently struggling to face that trauma while filming), the execution of making them into a cohesive plot felt incredibly disjointed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso, Sam Worthington and Adam Goldberg were insanely underutilized throughout the whole movie. I especially would have loved to see Goldberg\u2019s dickhead producer character get a deserved comeuppance for constantly berating Crowe\u2019s character. \u00a0\n\n2/10.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If I wanted to watch a demonically-belligerent Russell Crowe, I would have watched him sailing around the world on a tugboat finding cancer-ridden children to fight.",

            "It would be dull and forgettable if it weren't so infuriating.  The \"cursed film\" setup has so much potential to be subtle and creepy, but then there's an actual demon and it morphs into an incredibly generic possession movie.  Their in-universe remake of The Exorcist (not mentioned by name but they make it very obvious that's what it is) is also an incredibly generic possession movie, so the levels of mediocrity are a little hard to take. (ed. for clarity)",
            "I stupidly went to see this movie without reading up on it, thinking it was a sequel.\n\nTis was not. It was indeed a pile of shit",

            "He played the actor who died at the beginning. The one Crowe replaced. \n\nAs for the priest's sacrifice, it was probably intended to be a homage to The Excorcist. The priest in that did the same thing. This movie just didn't set up much reason for the priest to do it other than general  benevolence.",

            "Not super scary, but still a fantastic film. It felt like an X-Files episode, which is always a plus in my book.",
            "A great example of straightforward, fairly basic premise elevated through execution. I thought it was great and even my wife enjoyed it.",
            "I thought it was pretty terrifying ngl, especially towards the third act when they found out the truth. Besides that, i think it's more gory and disgusting because it deals with organs, dissection and etc...\nBut this movie still remains as my biggest suprise. 5/5",

I thought it was cool the way it was like a mystery movie that unraveled into a horror movie.  \n\nI don\u2019t know, trying to say things were or weren\u2019t scary is kind of a subjective mess to deal with and quantify.  I thought it was a good movie, it felt like horror should feel to me.",
            "One of favorites! I first saw it a few years ago during the rona lockdowns, and it was one of the only movies to actually *scare me* in years, and my oft-horror-hating partner loved it. I love how it takes place in a single location and how much spookiness is conveyed by the actress' facial expressions and body manipulations. Plus Emile Hirsch is *so* good. I wish he'd do more horror! Just an awesome movie, glad it has been getting the love it deserves the last few years.",
            "This is actually one of my favourite recent horror films. I think it was beautifully executed and had me in a chokehold throughout the whole film.

I wanted it to end.\n\nWhat's funny is that the part that scared me was the scenes when the two characters were just examining the dead body and talking to each other. I expected something paranormal to happen but nothing happened so the tension wasn't released.  It kept raising and raising. Well, I guess I just scared myself with my own expectations.\n\nThe actual ghost/paranormal scenes didn't scare me though. They were so typical.",

I feel you though. I can\u2019t get scared of/enjoy things like Wolf Creek or August Underground. If I wanted something more plausible, thinking a cadaver got up & walked around might seem goofy to me, too.",
            "Fair assessment. But with movies like this l I\u2019ve started to understand why horror and suspense are often categorized together. This kind of movie gets you do to idea of what is happening, not the in your face macabre. For whatever reason I just watched Hereditary and had a similar feeling. There were gnarly scenes but mostly it was figuring out what was going on that was the horror all along.",

            "I'm a huge fan of horror films that show unreliable senses: Seeing/Hearing things that aren't there, seeing/hearing the wrong thing, etc.  That made me really enjoy this.  That's also why Oculus is one of my favorite horror films, it's hard to know if what you're being shown is the truth or not and that to me is pretty horrific.  I also enjoy horror films even if they don't scare me that much, just the philosophy of knowing WHY these things are considered horrifying is interesting to me.  The transition from \"Oh just another autopsy\" to slowly understanding the puzzle behind Jane Doe, eventually realizing they need to leave and then figuring out they are stuck struck a chord with me.",
            "Admittedly, I don't understand how a film can scare you. Disturb you, yes, the picnic scene in The House Jack Built lives now rent free in my head. Jumpscares? Sure, that's an irrational response. But actually being afraid IRL because of a movie? I'm sorry, it just doesn't happen to me, I cannot understand that process.",
            "I think the concept is scary too, subjectively of course. Particularly the scary part is the ending, much like with horrors like The Woman in Black, The Ring, The Grudge, The Haunting of Bly Manor. The concept of a human being that has suffered so much, they become pure pain, a force of nature that can no longer be reasoned or bargained with and yet you still try to. Will it work, or will the pure rage and suffering destroy you too? I loved it, I like this theme in horror.",
            "Even so I don\u2019t really find it scary at all. Haunting of Hill House and The Conjuring did it better.",
            "I agree with you. It started off really well, but the unravelling of the \"mystery\" made ended up being exceptionally bland.",
            "Got too convoluted",
            "The reveal really did call for a prequel or something, digging into the lore! I would\u2019ve loved a follow up about the process of the burial rites alone cuz that all felt very intricate and intentional.",
            "My missus and I both considered it to be pretty fucking boring",
            "Jane Doe was more atmospheric and psychological. It was a more subtle slow burn than a lot of modern horror. Comparing Jane Doe it to Hill House isn\u2019t really fair since that was a series and had 10 episodes to tell the story and set the stage.",
            "it is really not good, everything past the autopsy scenes is full of tropes that make it really uninteresting to watch",
            "Like don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s not ground breaking and honestly I don\u2019t think it really has that much going for it but it\u2019s far from the worst I\u2019ve seen.",
            "So? If it\u2019s horror then it should be scary. If it\u2019s not scary then put it as thriller or psychological. You also act as if other horror films can\u2019t be scary and horrifying when it can like The Conjuring, Annabelle etc"

A drama or romance etc generally have like 2 or 3 ways they\u2019ll \u201cplay out\u201d once you hit Act 2.\n\nA horror movie may not even really show you what is going on until the end of Act 2.  It may change protagonists, it may change location abruptly and other options that typical genre films don\u2019t have\n\nIt\u2019s the unique aspect of horror that gets me to watch more of it than other genres\n\nThen if it manages to be truly unsettling or crazy, then, awesome.

He said the buildup is the same - you do the setup, and then subvert expectations. I thought that was so interesting.

            "A controlled fear and discomfort are fun. I am in no danger nor can i be hurt but i can either rally behind the survivor and hope for their safety or other movies i can sit back and enjoy a good actor playing a charismatic and terrible person. \n\nAlso i love how many risks horror can take, families they show, situations and survivors they celebrate! They feel more diverse than many other movies to me.",

I never knew what might happen or when, so I was constantly in a state of anticipation.\n\nBut in a lot of horror movies, the \"bad thing\" is ultimately revealed. . . It's like putting a name to your fear. There's something tangible I can focus on and overcome rather than this general dread of not knowing what is going to happen.\n\nSo, for me, maybe a bit of the old childhood trauma nudges me toward the horror genre!",

Like I love going to horror escape rooms for that adrenaline rush. And if I\u2019m watching something spooky with a crowd then I can get giddy from the scares.\n\nEDIT: I think I figured it out! Suspense keeps me engaged. In another genre there has to be a hook to convince me to keep watching, but with horror, I know something spooky is coming so that\u2019s already the hook. \n\nWhen I read books it\u2019s almost exclusively horror because that anticipation of something scary coming is what keeps me reading. And same with movies: I\u2019m always waiting on the edge of my seat to see what the scare will be.\n\n(And I prefer suspense in the form of supernatural horror because suspense that\u2019s about like, realistic crimes usually just makes me depressed about humanity).",

As he was talking he kept saying the movie was like a nightmare, like a recurring nightmare he had, where he is told to do the same thing repeatedly by some malicious force.\n\nWe kept talking and this guy said he has nightmares like 5 or 6 times a week, and that is why he hates horror films, because he already deals with nightmares, almost every night.\n\nAnyways, I myself have about one nightmare every 3 years. I have nightmares so rarely that I get really excited when I have one. I came to the conclusion that night after that conversation that the reason I like horror films is that it\u2019s like filling a need I have to be scared, something my subconscious won\u2019t do for me in the dream world.",

So eventually one of my friends I stayed the night with had me watch part 2 or 3 one night, mainly for the bewbs lol.. But I liked being scared, and so from about the age of 10 or so I would watch all the scary movies I could.  Other movies just bore me.. I mean come on \"oh.. The bad guys shot 1000 rounds at the good guy, and he stands up and kills 8 people with a six shooter\".. boring..

My parents wouldn't allow me to watch any of them and the rare moments I could catch a glimpse on a trailer or something, or if I managed to stay late at night and stumble upon one on TV, I was spooked to my bones.\n\nAfter I got like 20-21 years old, I thought to myself that I have to overcome this fear by trying to watch some of the classics and get desensitized of some sort. Movie after movie, the adrenaline rush and the jump scares started being fun instead of spooky and after almost 10 years of watching horror movies, this is the only genre of movies I will consciously watch. I might watch a blockbuster movie of another genre if I stumble upon it, but when I want to relax, horror is my comfort zone.\n\nSo for me, I think it's something you can build up instead of being \"wired\" from the very start.",

            "I have a theory called the \"Caveman\" Theory. Humans have evolved to the point where true fear and terror has become super rare. It's so rare that our brains have forgotten what it's like to experience this. This feeling was key to our survival as hunters and scavengers. When we watch horror movies we trigger that genetic memory of pure terror which gives us that adrenaline rush.",
            "Two reasons for me.\n\n1. Desensitization. Violence, gore, and other \"scary\" things in media don't have the impact they used to. I can recognize when something is scary cognitively but not feel it, if that makes sense. I seek out media to challenge that. Certain video games can still get to me when I'm in the mood. I have to dig for films. I suppose \"sedentary adrenaline junky\" would be apt here, but I can't remember the last time I got a rush from a horror film.\n\n\n2. I prefer experimental art. Horror is a space where cultural transgression can thrive as its purpose is to shock. Pushing boundaries is woven into the genre, thus it's a great way to express sentiments that go against societal standards. Horror is likewise something that can be done on a low budget. Anyone with a cellphone and internet connection has the essentials to shoot and distribute a horror film. Its accessibility makes the genre varied like no other, where alienating the general audience isn't much of a risk compared to other genres.",
            "For me, it's a genre that can seemingly take any other genre or sub-genre and manage to fit it into itself.   \n\nIt can subvert almost anything and make it scary, as someone else said, there are no (or very few) rules.\n\nDepending on my mood, there is always a horror film I can watch, but I need to be in a certain mood for other genres as a whole.",

People with shoestring budgets and rubber masks and a can do attitude creating art out of nothing that latches onto your brain like a spider onto a fly and leaves lasting memories to haunt you late at night.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a whole bunch of films from a whole bunch of genres and places and people, but nothing ever compares to a horror film because deep down maybe some of us don\u2019t laugh that much, or some of us don\u2019t weep, or some of us don\u2019t care for action and intrigue, but deep down everyone has something they fear.",
            "I think horror allows an in depth observation of the human condition. Horror movies are capable of pulling back so many layers of humanity in our fears, desires, wishes, hates. I think the horror genre has some of the best takes on being a good human and morality. What people do under distress and how they combat or cope with internal and external forces.",

            "I just had a similar conversation with my partner over The Outwaters and The Beach House, among a couple others. She hated Outwaters, and for extremely justifiable reasons. Same as Skinamarink, I totally understand if people don't like it. But the way I see it, if you're telling a cosmic horror story, why should the things you do end up seeing make any sort of sense? If something beyond mortal ken is involved why does it always do things in a typical narrative fashion? I think any actual encounter with Something would end up looking a lot more like the Outwaters than we think, and that's the thing that's so compelling to me. As someone who tends to prefer cosmic horror over most other types, you can have $5 and a dream and still make a compelling horror movie as long as your idea is good enough. And there will always be a subset of people that enjoy it, because horror is so open to interpretation that most things will resonate with at least someone, so you're rarely going to produce a complete failure. Even something like The Beach House, which I felt was marketed horribly for what it actually turned out to be and was actually fairly disappointed with at the end of, had a solid idea for a good cosmic horror idea and went for it, and I appreciate that immensely. Seems horror directors are much more likely to just full send on a completely batshit idea, like Glorious and their gloryhole Elder God. \n\n\nThis is not a shill for Skinamarink or The Outwaters, they're not good movies for the vast majority of people. I use them here because they really commit to the \"we're not going to show you and you're not going to understand\" and I love that in movies, but it is not to everyone's taste and not everyone enjoyed how these movies portrayed it.",
            "Thanks for that. I don't know that I've ever been able to nail down exactly why I love horror, and I think your words are it",
            "A lot of weird reasons others are listing, like being sick or into dark things, but to each their own.\n\nYou explained why I like it well, it is all about he freedom to do whatever. A lot of movies are formulaic and it makes them stale. Not every story needs to needs a love story or have the 'good guys' winning, let alone have good guys at all. It allows for a much more interesting story.",
            "everything you said is right but whats crazy is horror can also be very predictable but it still has this aura about it that keeps you watching. Ive seen so many horror movies that ive predicted to a T and still got to the end and felt like i watched a great movie. Its like even when we know for sure whats gonna happen the slight chances that we are wrong gives us the urge to keep going.",
            "This is pretty much true for me as well. Horror explores realms of the surreal, fantastical and spiritual, it goes places and does things that other genres don\u2019t. The adrenaline rush is a great bonus, but it\u2019s not why I keep coming back to horror.",
            "> horror really doesn\u2019t have any rules\n\nAnd with Hollywood being always defaulting to tell stories about white men, horror doesn't have to follow any of that.  (btw if you're someone who just had a vein just pop in your temple, the word \"defaulting\" is the issue.  If you're that person, settle down.)\n\nHorror is very inexpensive to make compared to other genres, and audiences are willing to watch for the thrills, instead of for known actors, and filmmakers can tell the stories they want to tell, and with the actors they want to use.  Like Ben in Night of the Living Dead (1968), and then Barbara in Night of the Living Dead (1990).\n\nYou just about cheer when Ginny turns the tables on Jason in Fri 13th Part 2.  Or the triple-twist in The Blob (1988) that results with Shawnee Smith triumphant.\n\nIt leads horror fans to seeing movies that can do anything and go anywhere.  Most often, in a world in which remakes and reboots rule the land, in horror, you can see films you have literally never seen before, and have no idea how they will end.  One movie, is a perfect example of that, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014).",
            "VERY well said. I was 8 when I saw my first terrifying film. 1963 black and white The Haunting. Every adult we've shown it to has been freaked out. I'm also lucky that my mother weaned me on tv like One Step Beyond, The Veil, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits. Then I found some others: The Invaders, The Addams Family, Bewitched, Shadow Chasers - which I KNOW Chris Carter (X-Files) watched and took notes from. It is a drug though. I went from Bewitched to The Walking Dead and Dexter. But for me, the BEST show nothing. They allow your imagination to take over, and create a sense of dread in your own mind. Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton were masters at this. Check them out; you won't regret it. Gotta warn you; not gratuitous sex or violence. There is violence, but it isn't slasher or gore.",

            "The \u201csafe fear\u201d aspect has always been huge for me. I\u2019m also a trauma and CSA survivor with a ton of anxiety and general fear. Horror gives me, at least temporarily, a sense of resolution to those feelings. I\u2019m giving myself something concrete and identifiable to be anxious about or scared of, rather than the nebulous sense of dread. I also tend to cope with my anxiety through preparedness, wanting to feel like I\u2019d know what to do or how to survive in all manner of emergency situations. Horror gives me so many opportunities to indulge that.",

Horror films usually aren't as tightly constructed as other types of films and there's an element of uncertainty that allows you to imagine your own response and fear to the situation portrayed. To use a metaphor, a horror film is more a sketch compared to the completed painting of something like a Rohmer film. I don't mean this in a sense of it being lesser, but that it allows you to fill in the gaps in the same way you can imagine a finished product when looking at a sketch.",

Most people said that the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the excellent Lovecraftian introduction, and IMO that's true, except for the intro being characterized as excellent. IMO, it's very run of the mill cosmic horror executed well, but nothing outstanding conceptually. Once the intro is done, it's just a slog to get through and never reaches those heights again.\n\nI know most people liked this movie a lot, but man, it did NOT work for me.",

Great script, Amazing score, amazing editing, great pacing, always moving on to the next incident or event.. absolutely sensational acting. authentically researched and it doesn't try to explain itself for the stupid.  it's so pure in it's intent and delivery. it never reveals too much and always keeps the audience off-balance. just no weak spots right up till the ending. The only gripe I've even ever heard of was about the ending and I actually wholeheartedly disagree with that. I think it was incredible. one of my all-time favorites films, period.\n\nI am not really a person of faith, but watching this movie almost makes you want to be a true believer in SOMETHING.. that is an accomplishment in and of itself.",

As soon as the child is involved there is no parent in the world that would have acted like those protagonists. This movie throws suspension of disbelief through the window and spits on it. Hated, hated, hated this movie. Great idea, the beginning is strong but by the end I was fuming.\nPeople shit on Prometheus and Alien Covenant for stupid protagonists and then go on to praise a stupid movie like this one",

            "Its a metaphore but its done in such a stupid and unbelievable way that just becomes infuriating. That movie and Skinamarink are two movies that people go on and on about here and I just absolutely despise. Both dreadful",
            "Same. The unsettling \u201cold gods of Appalachia\u201d feel to it was satisfying.",
            "Ooh! Mine was American Werewolf in London when I was like 5. Yay horror movie dads!",
            "Oh yeah, I was single digit age when I saw the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Tourist Trap, all the major slashers and even Eraserhead!",
            "Hey there fellow traumatizee!  My dad and older brother did the same.  I still don\u2019t like sleeping in a room with dolls",
            "Two more come to mind. \n\nLet's Scare Jessica to Death (1971) Hoopla/YouTube *rent*\n\nJessica is a semi Arthousie, semi \"am I going crazy\" Vampire film, or is it?\n\nThe Haunting of Julia (1977)\n\nJulia is about a haunted house/haunted woman, staring Mia Farrow.  Its also difficult to find. It does pop up from time to time.\n\nDamn, I was lucky to be a teen in the 70s.  So many great movies!",
            "Cool! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd",
            "Couldn\u2019t agree more.",
            "Yeah there is another one that\u2019s a drama I think.\n\nETA: free on Roku Channel, btw",
            "I saw that too as a kid! Permissive dads are the best lol.",
            "Awesome movie!!! Another one he showed me haha. I always thought it was a Stephen king movie for some reason. That jumpscare with the guy in the hospital bed haunted me haha.",
            "Eraserhead rules. I always get my friends who are having kids to watch it",
            "I made my mom throw out my raggedy Anne doll directly after \ud83d\udc80 that I don\u2019t remember but my mom does because she was so pissed at my dad haha",
            "I feel like I blocked out that jumpscare because when I watched it as an adult it still got me! When he's outside the house looking in through the windows, it's such a quick scene, but I still can't have my blinds open on the ground floor when it's dark out hahaha",
            "Haha, that\u2019s evil, in a good way \ud83d\ude02",
            "Vivarium (2020) is also great for this purpose"
