[Here is the first post on this sub regarding her statement as well as links to her tweets and the document](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/llzqzf1C1K) \n\n[Here is a follow up post highlighting specific abusive texts](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/nfGAKBySec) \n\n[Here is one of the few videos showcasing Alex threatening and insulting Alice on discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/yUdRYLT7Te)\n\n[In case the Google drive is broken here is a tweet containing some clips of the videos](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802120827418329547?t=q3XfXsauStB-jn4Qty58gg&s=19)\n\n[Here](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802121993199984738?t=3R551Nogh8haAtiMmO0uUw&s=19) [and here](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802122153967710686?t=3R551Nogh8haAtiMmO0uUw&s=19) where these final clips include a moment where he calls her the n-word, which is included in some of the texts as well. \n\nThere is also a 25 minute voice message in the Google drive, which you can listen to in [this video summarizing the allegations by YouTuber Exate](https://youtu.be/SYMA887G3N4?si=KSCWH4C4hX6OKJLu) (timestamp: 30:24)\n\n",

            "Him threatening her with abuse accusations over the situation with the cat is insane. You said fucked up shit to her cat like you'll snap its neck. Good luck with that 'she abused me too' defense. Idiot.\n\nThis was such a heavy read.",
            "He did fucking strangling motions when he threatened to *bash her head against the wall with a brick* like he was Lil OJ.\n\nHow unhinged do you have to be to do that on camera, even if you weren\u2019t an ~internet celeb~\n\n**What in the cinnamon toast fuck**",
            "I read through the whole doc - and, oh my gosh. I watched Alex\u2019s videos since before the eBoys but had dropped off in interest over the past year or so since he seemed so obsessed about Elphaba, which wasn\u2019t entertaining to listen to. All I can say is \u201cwhat the hell.\u201d I don\u2019t have any real relationship experience, but how someone could claim they love someone when treating them so poorly is beyond me. I don\u2019t know anything about Alice, but I feel bad that she stayed for so long with someone who obviously treated her so poorly. I hope she finds peace.",
            "I'm just shocked at how genuinely unhinged he comes across.  I've seen messages that are more viscerally shocking, but the frequency and manner that he says this stuff it's hard to even comprehend.  He was always a bit of a freak but this is like two mad level of vile. \n\nIt seems that a lot of people are learning that you can send a 40 minute long voice note today because idk if anyone on earth has ever done that before",
            "Not to make light of the horrible accusations, but I burst out laughing when he started with the \"Your boyfriend is an *internet celebrity* and needs to keep his circle small!!\" stuff. You haven't been relevant in years, sit down.",
            "In a recent video, he said something like \u201cI\u2019m sure some of my viewers are older but most of you are like 14-15, if you\u2019re older I dunno sorry but you\u2019re not my main demographic\u201d and I was like\u2026.? So you talk about these topics purposefully to kids? Rubbed me so weirdly. Very interesting with all this context, in that I think he likes feeling powerful in any situation. He knows kids will take his word as gospel and relishes that. He likes to exercise and wield some sick sense of supremacy over others and it\u2019s clear in this horrible behavior",

Feel absolutely awful for him tbh, kinda reminds me a bit of Gus and Eddy. Finding out someone you've been close friends with, worked with a lot and lived with for years is an abusive piece of shit must be a horrendous feeling :(",
            "once again i am here to say imallexx has always been and will always be a piece of shit.",
            "The clip of him sobbing and saying he\u2019s up and down and shedding the tears (the tears are real but 110% for himself because he knows he\u2019s fucked up.)\n\nIt\u2019s absolute classic emotional blackmail and psychological abuse. It was absolutely haunting to hear that clip because it was just near enough identical to the shit my ex girlfriend put me through and abused me with for years, constant mood swings, arguments, demeaning comments, physical abuse - all made to make you feel lucky that this persons even with you. Goes to far, cry feign forgiveness and reset. Leaves you like an absolute shadow of your former self after a year or so.",
            "Oh thank god I was waiting for a mega thread of this cause there\u2019s was way too many threads. thank you mods! \u2665\ufe0f\u00a0",
            "Normally I wait to hear out both sides but the evidence here is so damning and now multiple friends of Alex are coming out condemning him and are just as horrified as us. inabber made a statement on instagram saying he knew nothing about the relationship and wasn\u2019t even told they broke up until much later, and he\u2019s genuinely repulsed but what he\u2019s seen as we all should be. I really don\u2019t see a way out of this for Alex and this needed to be leaked, I\u2019m very proud of Alice for taking her power back and totally decimating what\u2019s left of his career. I\u2019m curious what he has to say for himself but I just don\u2019t see him being able to talk his way out of any of the clips circulating now.",
            "People saying if these people knew why did they not say anything. It\u2019s not on them to speak for a victim if the victim doesn\u2019t want to come forward. This is more than silly drama exposing people and if the victim didn\u2019t want to come out publicly then other people can\u2019t do it for them and if they posted vaguely about it they would get backlash of saying well where is the proof and people will just ignore it",
            "I never liked him since he made those false allegations against slazo. But genuinely I wasn\u2019t ready for him to be this much of an evil person.",
            "Can I just say I personally don\u2019t wanna see anyone doing the whole \u201cfinally, I have a valid reason to dislike this guy \ud83d\ude4c\u201d routine here. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen a lot over the past 24 hours and it\u2019s so incredibly unnecessary. Not only is it dumb because you are allowed to dislike a YouTuber without any reason anyway, but also it\u2019s hideously insensitive to be practically celebrating the fact that a woman got abused because it means you feel you can dislike her abuser and have it be \u201cvalid\u201d.\u00a0Please let\u2019s all do our best to remember that there is a real life human being who is a victim here.\u00a0Sorry, just had to get that out there. As always, the way people are responding to abuse allegations is disappointing, and revealing a *lot* about our unhealthy attitudes towards people we only know through social media.",
            "There\u2019s the commentary lads on twitter laughing about this and making memes, but it\u2019s ok cause it\u2019s making fun of Alex apparently.\n\nLook, he\u2019s a POS and deserves everything thrown his way, but these guys are turning the video about him bashing Alice with a brick into a meme. It\u2019s disgusting. Do they not realise there\u2019s a victim in this? Probably not, they\u2019re too focused on avenging Slazo and the usual anti-woke nonsense \n\n(idk if this makes any sense, sorry if it doesn\u2019t)",
            "I kept wondering why I knew the name ImAllexx without knowing who the fuck that was. Didn't this guy live with Memeulous? Or something along those lines? I heard his name through Memeulous. \n\nMemeulous isn't a piece of shit as well, is he?\n\nAs for ImAllexx, I don't need to say anything. I just hope he gets everything he deserves.",
            "Its always the ones you expect the most",
            "None of the Eboys are following Alex on Instagram now!",
            "Just want to say this for anyone that may relate to Alice's experience somehow, but feels they might be overthinking it like \"oh they never physically hurt me\" and the like.\nIf you're seeing this kind of attitude/behavior in your partner, TELL SOMEOME YOU TRUST. GET AWAY. My ex never hit me, but he similarly beat my self-esteem down, making me feel like a mentally ill, broken loser. Like I had to justify everything I did, up to and including my interests.\n\nAlex's behavior is an extreme case of a toxic partner, but you don't need to be getting yelled at with them on camera or kicked for asking them to take the trash out for it to be a bad situation. Alex is a horror story, hiding his narcacissm and cruelty while portraying himself as a good silly internet boy.",
            "The uncropped screenshots are a little weird but I'm worried people will use that to dispel her trauma, even though they show her doing not even a slither of what he did to her, she just used a word she absolutely should not have. One that he used AGAINST other people at the same time.\n\nTalking about these: [https://x.com/CopeAndSeetheYT/status/1802709608848310606](https://x.com/CopeAndSeetheYT/status/1802709608848310606)",
            "He\u2019s rubbed me the wrong way since the Slazo incident, my thoughts are with the victims, and I hope he goes down for this, once and for all.",
            "If ImAllexx responds with a ukulele video, I'm throwing my laptop out the window.",
            "I haven't seen a case like this in a while where it's been this bad and clear cut. He can't even try and really weasel his way out as he usually does because there is just so much evidence of the vile things he's done and said and the guy was stupid enough (I assume out of his ego making him think he's untouchable) to threaten to bash her head in on discord using his HD webcam. It is nice to see some more vindication for Slazo, but this is just awful.",
            "So I was doing a bit of a stalk through his old videos when I stumbled across this one:  \nAlice is in this video and so is Bear and the interactions they have are very telling in my opinion.  \nHe's talking about how 'shady' Elphaba's boyfriend is, and about the 4.45 mark is when Alice comes on camera properly. It's just so surreal to watch.\n\nElphaba: \"He's cute, he's funny, he's got a really good personality.\"  \nAllexx: \"Is that the type of thing you'd say about me?\"  \nAlice: \"No.\"\n\nKind of want a creator to do a video that explores all this background stuff too; there's so much to see with the context we have and also how subtle abuse can be.\n\n  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU-FvXj\\_rd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU-FvXj_rd4)",
            "this is reminding me of the gus johnson situation. white guy who makes comedy-adjacent videos on youtube turns out to be verbally abusive towards his partner and brings up his \u201cfame\u201d to manipulate her. \n\ni am so proud of these women who have come forward. i don\u2019t know if they realize their impact. seeing men like this have their facades ripped away to reveal their true nature is not only satisfying, but it is teaching young people what warning signs to look out for, and that people aren\u2019t always as they seem. they\u2019re showing young people that no matter how bad it gets and how ashamed they might feel for staying, you can still leave and people will support you.\n\neta: being exposed to these messages at as a young person could be disturbing but also good because if they ever get similar messages from a partner they will hopefully recognize much quicker the type of person they\u2019re dealing with.\n\nedit 2: don\u2019t watch the rachel oates video on the situation if you want to remain in blissful ignorance like i was about people supporting her. she just goes on reading so many comments from very uninformed people i couldn\u2019t finish the video",

            "This will be crass but\u2026 I\u2019m not at all shocked the this guy is abusive. He was always publicly a pos. I\u2019m more shocked no one looked into him sooner about shit like this, given how he committed a libel campaign about Slazo.",

            "This triggered me. It\u2019s exactly what I went through with my abusive ex and then it turned physical.\n\nIMO there is NO explaining this away, no context which would ever make any of it okay. \nHe\u2019s a textbook abuser and I hope he never lives it down. \n\nThe stuff he\u2019s said is just so disgusting.",

            "I went though and read the screenshots and it just upset me so much. The microdetail of the horrible things he did and said is vile. However, the macro aspect of relentlessly bullying a girl behind closed doors, somebody who just wanted to love you and be happy and safe. It\u2019s honestly inhumane and repugnant. \n\nI can\u2019t get my head around it, she just wanted to be cared for and be loved with her nice cat :( I suppose that is exactly what abusers do though, they find sweet people with beautiful intentions and destroy them.",

When you are cornered by an abuser, you either fight back or you kick the bucket. She needed to protect herself and her cat from that monster so she fought back.\u00a0\n\n\nIn my eyes, that's self defense and if you call it anything other than that, then maybe you're just another Alex who has probably did the things he has done. He's not the victim here. Never was, never will be. He needs to be prisoned for domestic violence, harassment and stalking.\u00a0",

Alice replied saying that this sort of language was considered normal in the relationship because of Alex saying it all the time, and she apologises for it.

While it\u2019s been a bit\u2026bizarre with him, I am aware of his past with people and him accusing and not apologising for calling someone else an abuser that turned out to be false. I don\u2019t know much about that drama and kinda forgot about it. \n\nI am not going to say that I knew he was an abuser or some sort of dodgy person, but I didn\u2019t expect it to come out that he was a domestic abuser/abusive asshole. He always came across to me as \u2018soft\u2019 I guess, I also assumed he was gay, as I am pretty sure he said so in a video before. \n\nRegardless, 2 months ago, he went from his ImAlexx channel to one that is presumably his name, I wonder is that might have had a role in this? I believe in one of the calls, he was talking about YouTube holding his revenue or money or something.\n\nEdit: I have no idea why people are downvoting this, I guess his fans or something turn up?\n\nEdit 2: Since people cannot seem to understand, \u2018soft\u2019 is talking about how he didn\u2019t seem like he was going to be an abuser based on his on screen persona and merch he released. I also assumed he was gay because on videos of his, I cannot remember what one but I am pretty sure he said so in a podcast or some kind of group video a while back. \n\nHe\u2019s also done videos on \u2018gay tests\u2019 which seems like something a straight content creator wouldn\u2019t do and released a video about homophobia he experienced.",

That\u2019s natural for a lot of people and people are allowed to take away what they will from a very public situation. I personally feel a sense of \u201cfinally the youtube community will stop thinking this guy is a good person\u201d after years of feeling that way and I think that\u2019s fine to feel that way. If a horrible person is platformed, and most of the public thinks they are great and will flatten you if you say otherwise, it does feel like a sense of justice when the mask falls off. That doesn\u2019t take away from the real situation though: I am so sorry to Alice, no one should go through what she did, and I hope she is able to press charges if that\u2019s what she wants to do. This is her story more than anyone else and I hope she can find peace and healing. I hope most of all she can forgive herself for any moments he brought her down to his level with him, because I know all too well how easily that happens and it is not her fault :( \nThis whole situation is just gross and disgusting and however people want to react I think is justified; it\u2019s a hard thing to take in and process for anyone who was even a fan of the guy.

Reminds me a bit of the Chugga situation, where a lot of people only seemed concerned about how betrayed NCS and Jon must have felt when the news broke, with no thought or sympathy whatsoever extended to the actual victims. It\u2019s weird.\u00a0",

I won\u2019t shame people for that\n\nOn the other hand, keep that shit to yourself. There are actual people involved in this and they are not you. People need to understand that morbid humor only helps the person making the joke, and most of the time harms those who hear about it. Unless you were one of the victims in this (which they aren\u2019t, let\u2019s be clear about that) they don\u2019t need to hear it, and you don\u2019t need to speak about it.

There are clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who specialise in dealing with abusive men. \n   You are not the first or the last man to be an abusive piece of shit. Find the right doctor, it will likely be some form of outpatient program, and put in the work. You need professional support as you start breaking down your personality and habits to start building the version of yourself that you and everyone around you deserve. The only way to make a life worth living from this low point is to truly accept your actions to ensure you don't repeat them and take the consequences with humility. \n\n. Stay off the internet. \n   Your time online is over. You fucked it and should not be in a position of influence any longer. You can re-evaluate in 10 years if you really feel you've become a better person, and I better see your channel focused on reducing abusive behaviour in other men. For now, just be glad you've not been arrested for assault and live off-line. \n\n. Finally, you killing yourself will be pointless and self-serving. No one wants you to die, and you'd just be ensuring you don't have to accept the consequences of your behaviour or do any actual work. Make your life worth living by rebuilding a better person from the shit that currently is.",
            "No one is responsible for Alex's actions moving forward. Like any other thing.\n\nKeep in mind he participated in doing this to other people. Keep in mind he allegedly treated people in his life terribly, and we have 2 of his exes speaking about him, one of which with loads of evidence that even her worst behavior would not provide enough \"context\" to let Alex look good. \n\nAlex needs to log off and put some honest effort into treating whatever issue he has that causes him to abuse others the way he does. His flying off the handle like that is not healthy at all. Everyone goes \"go to therapy\" but he needs to go to therapy and be dead fucking honest with the therapist that he has emotional regulation issues, anger management issues, and issues regarding relating to others/empathy/etc. Everyone wants to diagnose him with something but he needs to get to the root of it and learn to not treat people like this. And he needs to get off the Internet. \n\nI don't believe he will harm himself. If he makes an attempt I do believe he probably has loved ones still close to him and monitoring him. Like other commentators have mentioned, he can't be so naive to not believe this shit would have been recorded or come out one day in one way or another.\n\nIt really fucking sucks, but if shit like this comes out, if you have to own up to your ugliest shit, all you can do is work on yourself for real and not just try to gain validation from others. \n\nIf he chooses to die by suicide then that does not make anything better for him at all, and I hope he knows that.",

It's normal for a teenager ro call his girlfriend a stupid bitch out of anger and then feeling bad and learning to control himself more afterwards. This is a fact of maturing, and we can have more empathy than assuming hearing about someone's worst heated moments in a relationship is an indication of their core being.\n\nWhat's not acceptable is repeated and consistent verbal abuse, at situations where it is no way appropriate, with no indication that there was an attempt to resolve the situation, or threats of violence. And this imallex story is one of the grossest examples I've personally read in a while.",

She went through this shit, she lived through this shit. Maybe you disagree but whenever someone suffers, while I can support them for talking about it, I'm not happy that they feel like they have to or that they went through it to begin with.",

            ">readers are sick of the google documents. \n\nI'll say. There's over 22,000 words in these docs, just in the text, not counting images. That's longer than Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.",
            "This might be a hot take but I feel like none of these documents contain the truth, but both people are being honest about their experiences. \n \nIt's almost 4 am, so I won't elaborate now, but it seems like they tell a lot of similar stories in different ways, and I don't think they are lying about how they emotionally interpreted the situations or how they were impacted by the relationship.\n \nThe one weird thing that I would like someone to explain to me is how Fraser can hear coughing through the walls, but can't hear his dog barking and his girlfriend screaming, calling, and texting. Fraser says the walls are thin and his mic could pick up her making noise in another room, but then said he didn't hear the commotion (he does not elaborate on what sorts of noises he can hear, so I'm inclined to believe what she said about him getting mad about relatively quiet sounds). I get he was sleeping but if your ears are so sensitive that you get anxiety from your girlfriend walking around while you record, I do not understand how you sleep through that.",
            "I don't think any of this covers iNabber in glory, but it also seems pretty within the realms of a typical failed relationship between relatively immature 20-somethings. The stuff about her not being able to make noise while he works makes him sound prick-ish, but I do think calling it 'confinement' is an example of using the worst possible sounding word to illustrate that point. \n\nAll in all I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with the guy from what I've seen, but I also think it's been inappropriately framed especially coming off the back of the extremely serious nature of the abuse with ImAllexx.",
            "Definitely doesn't seem like he's some big evil abuser, but on a personal level it's giving me bad vibes how much his last document is filed with him saying things like \"as you can see this proves she's blatantly lying\" or \"this claim is absolutely insane\". Like I can understand him wanting to counteract what she's saying if he doesn't believe it's true, but it seems like he's not willing to give room to the idea that she could have experienced things differently to the way he thinks they should be read.  \n\nIdk this definitely just seems like a bad relationship that shouldn't be public, but it's definitely a little off putting how his instinct seems to be to just completely shut her side down without much grace",
            "I think they both should handle this in private... Either of them is not a criminal, they just were in a bad relationship, and getting to know the details of the sex life of a couple I don't even know was not on my bingo card.\n\nI think that this is awkward and unhealthy for everyone\n\nEdit: typos",

            "This just seems like a toxic relationship, where both felt like they were wronged. I think they both need to grow the fuck up, and just ignore each other, nothing good is going to come from this.",
            "I've read the over 100 combined pages of Fraser's 2 documents and Kirst's 1. A lot of both sides (near 90%, in fact) is pure hearsay. Things under the following categories cannot be regarded as reliable evidence: \n\n* Messages each of them sent to friends talking about the relationship, which of course can be made up or filtered through their personal bias\n* Public social media posts each of them made in the past expressing gratitude or joy at aspects of the relationship, when this type of content would of course want to paint a positive public picture regardless.\n* Screencaps of exchanges between Fraser and Kirst in which they still disagree on the interpretation of an incident, hence leaving no decisive conclusion as to what is the truth.\n* Long explanatory texts from either party explaining their interpretation and feelings around an incident with no supporting evidence.\n\nThrowing out all the inconclusive types of points listed above, here is what I could gather about the proven infractions of both parties.\n\nKirst:\n\n* On at least two occasions, she used guilt to try to pressure Fraser into sex. The incident where she immediately guilts him saying his rejections of breakup sex made her conscious about her weight, as well as a separate incident where she again guilts him by expressing disappointment that he didn't take things further when she got on top of him naked and (in her own words) begged him to initiate sex.\n* Her own account and the evidence does suggest that her eating disorder came about more so due to her own interpretations and insecurities. Fraser never asked or implied that she needed to diet, lose weight, nor did he insult her weight. The evidence supports the opposite of her claim that Fraser is responsible for her eating disorder. It is unfounded for her to so strongly and publicly blame something caused by her own insecurities on Fraser.\n\nFraser:\n\n* Knew his dog attacked Kirst multiple times, including at least one attack putting her in the hospital and another leaving her trapped on top of the couch for 2 hours. Even after that, He was callous and stubborn, not taking his dog's training seriously and sending Kirst defiant messages tilting her about the dog doing things outside the training restrictions. Fraser's rebuttal doesn't sufficient address this, they largely amount to listing examples of where Kirst spoke positively about the dog even after the attacks, which proves nothing.\n* He did say \"let's have sex at the spa\" ahead of one of their travels. This is extremely inappropriate given that it is a public space. Kirst further claims that Fraser tried to coerce her into sex while at a spa, which Fraser denies. Neither side has evidence for or against it going further than Fraser's inappropriate \"let's have sex at the spa\" comment ahead of the trip.\n\nThe 'financial dependency' point, both of them were at fault for it:\n\n* Fraser was clingy at the start of the relationship and was the one to push for Kirst to move in with him and allow him to cover rent. While he didn't force or threaten, he was pushy and insistent at the start despite Kirst expressing reservations.\n* Kirst did make hints to Fraser that she was dissatisfied with her regular job and was enthusiastic and agreeable when he suggested an arrangement to help with this that made her financially dependent on him.\n* After they broke up, Kirst continued to live in their shared flat for free for months. During this time: Fraser did not understand how unhappy and cut off Kirst felt from her \"real\" support networks and life despite having more than sufficient shelter in a home he was paying for. Kirst similarly overlooked the huge amount of financial support Fraser was giving her and expected him to read her mind and put all the blame on him for an arrangement she has co-developed with him from the start. I do not believe that her efforts to scale back on luxuries and save up enough to move away from Fraser are aligned with how badly she claims she needed to get away from him, including turning down Fraser's offer to put himself on the hook legally to fund the first few months of a separate home for her.",
            "None of this should\u2019ve been made public. This isn\u2019t someone taking down their abuser, this is the dirty laundry of a toxic and immature relationship being aired out in public for no reason.",
            "I literally can\u2019t read any of the text screenshots they included. They\u2019re just completely pixelated. \n\nSomething that\u2019s weird to me though is how much of this happens over text, when they literally live together. Like, what\u2019s with the extensive paragraphs? Just go in the other room and talk! The extent I text people I live with is just \u2018teas ready\u2019 \u2018where r u\u2019 why are these people not conversing in person\n\nIt doesn\u2019t effect my opinion on the allegations either way it\u2019s just strange to me.",
            "As I said in the previous post:\n\nClearly a toxic relationship. Bad behavior from both parties. This should have stayed private. I am bothered that Kirsty hijacked Alice\u2019s situation to make it about herself. It has put the focus in the wrong place. To me that is my main takeaway, Kirsty\u2019s intentions in bringing up this situation at this time seem dubious.",
            "This shit did not need to become public. Just seems like another relationship that didn\u2019t work out",
            "I feel like there's no real abuse on either part here, just two people dealing with a breakup badly and maybe feeling a bit sorry for themselves/defensive. It's clear from the way they both communicate with each other that none of this is anything like imallexx.",
            "The fact that she's done this by piggy-backing off Alice's experience with ImAlexx makes me feel like she's not much of a genuine person with this.\n\nHer first tweet about this was basically a \"but look at *meeeeeee*\" post claiming Fraser was on the same level as Alex but then turned around and said \"but I didn't mean *that*\" when that's exactly what she tried claiming.\n\nIt seems like she exaggerated a lot of things (like him recording meaning she was \"confined\" when it was just about him needing quiet. Everyone working from home typically needs silence and it's not uncommon for the working person to ask for quiet when working.) and he's a bit emotionally stunted/not very bright where relationships are concerned. \n\nThis entire situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I don't believe either of them were perfect in the relationship. They're young 20 somethings and it sounds like the relationship and situation wasn't great, but to use Alice's experiences and coming forward to try to paint a bad relationship as \"just as bad\" really doesn't make me trust in what she's saying.",

Kirsty may come out with another document, but I think I\u2019ll need a TL;DR for that. I\u2019ve noticed little grammatical/spelling errors in Nabber\u2019s latest document as well as Kirsty\u2019s first. Maybe this is nothing, but part of me thinks that even they\u2019re both tired too.\n\nWhat we know is that there\u2019s a more serious situation that\u2019s still ongoing, and where I\u2019d like to think that everyone can actually agree; the Alex drama. I think it\u2019s healthier to spread love to Alice rather than take either Frazer or Kirsty\u2019s side, or even fence sit.",

            " It seems their relationship isn't on the extremely abusive and dangerous level as ImAlexx and Alice. And Kirst releasing all of this information right after Alice seems suspect, as if she's trying to get some attention and turn tide against iNabber by revealing the details of a bad relationship as something more sinister and disturbing (not totally defending him, but that's my take). Both said and did gross things, and we really didn't need to hear all of this played out in public, but here we are.",
            "i could be wrong\ni just started watching a vid on the docs fraser and kirsty just released, idk if it\u2019s just me but i feel like they\u2019re distracting from the whole situation with alex? kind of making it about themselves. i know a little bit about what they\u2019ve said about each other (fraser and kirsty) and it\u2019s idk it seems the relationship def sucked and i feel bad for that but there\u2019s some stuff that i felt should have been kept private",

She's been posting one tweet after another for over an hour now.\u00a0\n\n\nShe does have some valid points (how Fraser neglected to manage his aggressive dog when it constantly attacked her is abhorrent), but her insistence on saying he is 100% to blame for her self esteem issues and money problems comes across as particularly untrue.\u00a0\n\n\nShe keeps saying he promised her that he would provide for her as if that is proof of financial abuse. Girl, he shared the messages of you complaining that your regular job couldn't meet the lifestyle you wanted. Even if he was willing to support you, you agreed to it completely. And surely no one would think a promise to provide for their partner should still continue after a breakup.\u00a0",

            "Yada yada the relationship sucked and shouldnt have been public etc. etc. \n\nThough (imo) Fraser is at the very least a giant asshole. Letting a dog bite people that intensely and that often is absolutely insane. After a single attack there should be consequences, and in all honesty, even before that considering the described behavior. \n\nThe language he uses is also very typical for an abuser (not saying he is, but just that it is the same languages) with sentences like \u201cthis claim is absolutely insane). He is not just sharing his experience, he is framing it for you, so you don\u2019t have the chance to think yourself. This makes me highly suspicious of his side of things. \n\nThe last thing that really does not sit well with me is the way he speaks about her issues, it feels very dismissive. This is ofcourse contingent on believing that she is not lying, however i truly believe she is telling the truth (about depression, ED\u2019s trauma bonding etc.) as she does display those traits very clearly. \n\nIt is very rare in (emotionally) abusive relations that both parties are nearly 50/50 at fault. This is a narrative set in place to make victims who are not perfect (aka all) have even less support. And i do believe this is important to always keep in mind in such topics.",
            "If I had to make a guess at what set Kirst off regarding the ImAlex situation, it wasn't Alice's story or Alex's actions, but Fraser's pile of IG stories responding to it. Having watched a decent amount of the guy up until this point, he does seem like the type to just bombard people with apology after apology or justification after justification, trying to look conciliatory while also seriously downplaying their involvement in whatever offense has happened. \n\nIt's never, \"Yes, I hear you. I did wrong and I'm sorry.\" It's, \"Look I'm really really sorry. X and Y happened and things got out of hand. I'm going through XYZ right now and you know that. I don't know how this happened, it's insane. Now everything is going to fall apart and I'm so stressed right now...\" Suddenly the focus is no longer on what happened, but how what's going on is going to affect THEM. And I don't think the dude can help it. It's an unhealthy defense mechanism at this point. So any time Kirst makes a statement, he's going to release a 12 page doc to distance himself, even when there's barely anything left to be said. He just can't let her get the last word in.\n\nIf THAT is what left Kirst the most traumatized, I'm not surprised that she got upset seeing him \"make it all about him.\" She just might not have had the words to express that this is what he was doing and instead bumbled into making far bigger accusations that she couldn\u2019t back up since she hasn't fully processed all that happened in their toxic relationship yet.",
            "People are bending themselves backwards to play both sides here but it's very simple for me.\n\nOne party left the relationship with permanent scars and an ED.\n\nThe other left totally unscathed. \n\nY'all can keep simping for iNabber if you want but I'm good.",

It's very possible to view the same situation in two entirely different lights, it's even extremely common.\n\nFraser's responses irritate the hell out of me but that's just the way he phrases things. Kirst seems inclined to phrase things rather dramatically as well. My impression is that both of these people were shitty and should not have dated, and while I absolutely understand why Kirst felt the need to vent about this, and I do believe people misinterpreted her original statements in a way that sounded worse than she meant, this was so not the time to do it.\n\nAnd about the sounds I lean towards thinking the same as the other reply. I can sleep through thunderstorms, vacuums, stuff being thrown at me, but I'll wake up from a cat meowing gently and once I'm awake I'll hear someone clear their throat in the downstairs living room.",
            "some people can just sleep through things lol, I can get really pissy about noises while I'm awake but I can easily sleep through extremely loud thunderstorms and things that would usually make you wake up. plus he could've been wearing like ear plugs to sleep if he's sensitive to noise",

They are picking and choosing each other's worst moments to show to the world and hiding their own in a way that will only hurt both of them in the end. I'm not thrilled that she's also using another woman's abuse as a jumping point to try to destroy her ex's career but that also doesn't mean he isn't toxic in his own ways.",
            "It's probably true that immature early 20's kids being dicks to each other when they're living with partners for the first time could probably describe a lot of drama, not every failed relationship requires a twitlonger.

I haven\u2019t read his document in full but after reading the first two, it feels like it was unhealthy on both ends. i can\u2019t definitively say not abusive because I wasn\u2019t in it, but from what I can gather from the evidence, I don\u2019t see it as abusive. they both did bad things and are trying to save face i feel. edit: just finished reading his document i 100% agree w you",
            "You know what I think it is? I honestly don't think he's particularly intelligent.",
            "Said this on another thread but it\u2019s really remarkable how inabber\u2019s personal editorializing style really shines through no matter the format",
            ">\"as you can see this proves she's blatantly lying\" or \"this claim is absolutely insane\".\n\nThis part of his commentary really rubs me the wrong way. It is essentially how he handles his youtube videos. He makes comments about how blatant or insane something obviously is but the reality is that it's not always that cut and dry. It's just that he can sensationalize whatever accusations he makes on little evidence. It's exactly why I stopped watching him. He grandstands. He makes great claims about morality. He does the cover-your-ass thing so many people like him do where it's like, \"Yeah, I once did this bad thing in the past but that was when I didn't know better!\" and downplays any kind of bad behavior he may have done in order to secure the higher ground. And he decides on the narrative first and forces the evidence to fit, even when the evidence may not fit as well as he thinks. There's never any room for nuance or discussion or alternate takes. \n\nAnd people like him always have skeletons in their closet that they can't admit to. I don't even think he is aware of how bad he looks. I think his ego just won't let him entertain the possibility that he could be even *partially* wrong here unless it's something he can downplay as usual.\n\nSo then when he says things like \"she's blatantly lying,\" it feels like he's just treating this as another one of his videos where he calls someone out for whatever, all while claiming he's above ever doing anything bad in his entire life (and if he did, it wasn't that bad or there's a good excuse for it). Dude's a creep, full stop.\n\nI agree to your last point too. I don't think this should be aired publicly because there is a lot of toxicity overall. But he's clearly not used to being put in the hot seat like this and his handling of it does not make him look good.",
            "I'd argue that him trying to prove she's lying well, just doesn't work.\n\nThe dog thing by itself makes me much more inclined to believe her since she received physical wounds and has pictures to prove it + messages that support it. I wouldn't let any dog bite like Kenji does *once*, but it happened multiple times under Fraser's roof.\n\nSo, like, sure, if he wants, we can *say* they \"both did wrong\" and \"this relationship shouldn't have become public\"... but it won't really change that it appears his actions and inactions directly resulted in *clear* harm whereas hers... just didn't.",
            "Definitely something that makes me question Fraser a bit more than Kirsty, he's not really hearing out her side of the story or he would have just taken her points and defended them rather than calling the claims stupid or insane.",
            "Exactly this should not be something that\u2019s aired out to the entire internet\ud83d\udc80it\u2019s just two people who weren\u2019t compatible, were shitty to eachother, and haven\u2019t gotten over the breakup.",
            "To add to your point about the ED, I find it a little disingenuous of Kirsty to say that the stress of living with Fraser was the sole reason she had physical symptoms such as nausea, migraines, hair loss and rashes. ALL of these can be attributed to physical symptoms of a restrictive eating disorder (speaking from experience here). Could the stress have contributed to, or further exasperated these symptoms (or vice versa, depending on whether the ED or the stress triggered them in the first place)? Absolutely. But my cynical side does wonder if she\u2019s relying on people not knowing that these symptoms are fairly common in people with restrictive EDs, so that she can parse them as All Fraser\u2019s Fault. That doesn\u2019t sit right with me. In fact, quite a few of her statements blaming her mental and physical health issues wholly on Fraser don\u2019t sit right with me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI still think she\u2019s a victim of certain things (the dog attacks especially which are horrifying and Fraser is still being WAY too flippant about imo, and personally I do believe it\u2019s plausible that Fraser made inappropriate verbal comments about her weight that *contributed to* - not caused - her ED) and she wasn\u2019t treated very well in general. My heart goes out to her. I can definitely sympathise with her feeling like she was trapped in that housing situation, with a dog she was scared of, and in a toxic relationship. But imho she would\u2019ve come across SO much better if she made an effort in her doc to take accountability for things like weaponising her mental health on occasion, and pressuring her partner into sex (which is something I\u2019ve pointed out in literally every doc thread since this started, because like\u2026. As much as I usually hate this rhetoric, it is a big \u201cif the genders were reversed\u201d moment for me).\u00a0  \u00a0\n\n\nOverall, I think my reaction to any more docs that potentially come out is just gonna have to be \u201cy\u2019all need therapy, and preferably to refrain from being in any romantic relationships until you can communicate better and take responsibility for yourselves\u201d tbh \ud83e\udd72",
            "Bless you for your TDRL I do not think I could handle another google doc. \nThis seems like two people that seemed to bring out the worst parts of one another. It definitely feels icky to be reading the private details of their relationship. I'm all about accountability and believing victim, so I guess my question is where would something like this even fall",

            "Many thanks for the TLDR guys",
            "Iirc, Kirst said that actually most conversations did happen in person. \n\nBut given one of them is an online personality (I don't know about Kirst but probably one as well), it makes sense that some of the conversations happened over text. Because you don't wanna walk in during a recording and talk about some things.",
            "Theyve all been pixelated for me too. I assumed its whatever my mobile opens the file on.",
            "Her saying over and over again that she didn\u2019t want to talk about any of this and that it\u2019s fucked up that she has to talk about it really really irritated me. \n\nShe publicly made very serious allegations against someone in the public eye, explicitly tying these allegations to a huge public story regarding a different online creator being abusive to a different person. To act like she isn\u2019t 100% responsible for creating this situation where she was \u201cforced\u201d to come out and explain the entire relationship is extremely disingenuous.\n\nI agree with a lot of the other comments on this post, that based on both of their Google docs their relationship was incredibly fucking toxic and they brought out the worst in each other. But she is the one who brought their relationship into the public eye to be picked apart and analyzed, and it\u2019s really off-putting to hear her whine about that over and over again as if she didn\u2019t fully create the situation she is upset about (to be clear, she is fully responsibly for talking about the relationship publicly in the way that she did, NOT fully responsible for the toxic relationship itself).",

            "exactly this",
            "Yeah imo even if kirst has valid points she shouldn't have vague tweeted about how she was treated by Fraser as a response to the ImAllexx allegations. It does take away from Alice's situation as made evident how the news cycle already moved onto this shit from kirst and Fraser. And I know we are guilty here but this is all people have moved onto and it's still serious (if not completely exhausting) but it has completely distracted from Alice and her allegations against alex",

I know people have said it suggests she was legit because the insta was only followed by her friends but at the same time someone can easily make posts like that that are exaggerated to seek attention from friends.

And Kirst didnt do herself any favours to garner sympathy by hijacking Alice's trauma and implying their experiences were the same thing. I have to wonder if the timing had been different and the hypocritical element of making this about herself hadn't been there, if this may have unfolded completely differently",

            "I definitely think they both seem not the best at handling this, more evidence of why it should have been kept quiet and not in the public eye. I understand fraser wanting to clap back so quickly and bluntly because this stuff sticks, but I also think that in some respect him doing so isn't a great look for someone that so often takes a moral stance against things.  \n\nHe's absolutely not as bad as Alex, that's not even a question and I think it's pretty irresponsible of her to bring it up as if it was, but I also understand the desire to point out that speaking out against the behaviour of others is easier than acknowledging your own behaviour and it seems like fraser isn't quite able to accept how his behaviour has affected other people yknow. \n\nI don't think there's a winner, I just think that it's gonna be hard to take a lot of what fraser says about others to heart for me personally",
            "Yeah, it's most likely just a toxic relationship between two people that treated each other badly, it just doesn't seem that necessary for Fraser to tack on stuff like that at the end, and it does raise one or two questions.",

It's hard to not see drama pop up in your feed.\n\nThe biggest point that goes against this supposed former employee, is how companies like Twitch, or Youtube handle bans.

Not because it's falsified or anything, but because it opens the person, and company, up to a lawsuit.

            "Cody didn't even say who it was. Dr.Disrespect could've easily just gone \"why are you all saying that it's me?! They never said a name!\" and he would've technically been right.\n\nHe's not exactly the brightest Youtuber, huh?",
            "And OJ was found not guilty. AKA they did that shit and got away with it.\n\n\u00a0 Ewww.\u00a0\n\nETA: \u2026damn autocorrect",
            "\"No wrongdoing was acknowledged,\" so you admit you did something wrong to be acknowledged????",
            "K dude.",
            "what is this dude doing...he better have a better answer for that in a stream next time or something because i can hear the storm coming",
            "couldn't have expected less from someone who defended NickMercks",
            "It's always the \"protect the kids from the left\" dudes that project the hardest",
            " Bro thinks he\u2019s Mini Ladd",
            "Unironically, it was OJ's defense for a long time, even though we all know he did it. That's why you can't trust court results blindly lol",
            "Totally reminds me of Dennis Reynolds from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.",
            "Wouldn't be surprised if the settlement says that he can't publicly deny this",
            "Ok so like seizures can kill people, which really gets me mad",
            "Sounds like attempted murder to me",
            "oh yeah i think he cheated on his wife and jumped on the whole \"trans bad\" wagon or trying to be anti-woke",
            "considering Elon has an obsession with breeding\n\ni can safely say people with that mindset often project, like they turn out to be huge POS but hey \n\n  \n\"trans bad am i right\" /s",
            "Yeah, we're not just trying to live our lives to them. Just us existing is somehow grooming. Me, someone who works from home and only leaves to pick up my t and take my family out places when they visit, is obviously somehow grooming your kid by existing. I'mma make your daughter be your son(sarcasm obviously). And they're always the ones doing actual grooming. I'm just tired.",
            "i dont know if its projection or that its intentional to normalise accusations of paedophilia to take away meaning off it.",
            "Yo Doc, I heard you like \u2018em young\u00a0",
            "It is *exactly* the type of response you should expect from someone like this.",
            "Dr. D was huge on Twitch, he had a few controversies on there and got banned seemingly randomly. \n\nPeople speculated, but neither Twitch nor Dr. D responded what it was about. Dr. D always would say \"ohh boy I cannot wait for you to find out why I got banned, I am going to bury Twitch\" or something to that effect.\n\nWithin this week, someone claims there are internal messages that state Dr.D was sexting an underage girl and set a meetup with her during an event.\n\n\nThis is as far as I know with everything and have simplified it drastically. Pretty much the easiest to do is look at lsf and find his mention and go from there.",
            "PARDON!!!!!????",
            "OJ?",
            "\"Their phones did.\"",
            "\"Nah uh uh they never proved that! That was never proven!\"",
            "\"They won't acknowledge any wrongdoing, because of the implication.\"",
            "That would definitely explain the weird way of trying to phrase it. Dude's wordsmithing.\n\nI'm really interested in the people who knew and just kind of went silent.\n\nSlicker for one, I remember him *knowing* that it was something extremely damaging. Once the story about it being over \"contract shopping\" started circulating, that dude went silent. Now he's back on Twitter trying to collect his clout for having known all along.\n\nHe didn't work for Twitch when this was going down and their employees were probably under NDA but they were talking to him anyway, so why stay silent? Fat check from Doc?\n\nEDIT: I just realized that someone who was 14 then is 18 now - time is going by too fast these days. People may have been unable to say anything due to the victim being a minor and now they're an adult. Legal/Court things performed by the parents during the settlement also may expire when the kid becomes an adult. If so I would expect more to come out over the next few days.",
            "yeah, i've got photosensitive epilepsy myself so that clip was enough for me to decide that he was awful. this stuff is just a new can of worms. but hey his viewers thought it was very cool apparently\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r297ytmzd28d1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5f5b11824576f15bf6c2b5956791348972c7d1",

            "Being accused of messing with kids is tough to get out of whether it's true or not. To me it just puts you in that category of yuck automatically. I'm sure other people feel that same way. Ehh he was always complaining when I clicked his stream anyway.",
            "Thought he was banned because he live-streamed a public bathroom?",
            "In absolute fairness, he didn't, like, walk up and point his camera at the kid. He decided it was a good idea to film a selfie video in a public bathroom and there were also kids in there at the time who could be seen in the background.\n\nExtremely stupid but not as bad as the above description makes it sound.\n\nFor this new allegation, yeah, the wording of his non-denial makes me basically 100% certain he did it.",
            "LMFAOOO Yupp. Damn autocorrect\u00a0",
            "Likely exactly what you've said in your edit. NDA set up to protect the minor that has now expired because they're an adult. \n\nThere's multiple former staffers who have corroborated the story now and his response is... pretty bad. But I'd still like to have confirmation from one of the staffers who pulled the trigger. It'd be the smoking gun needed to shut down the people rushing to his defense",
            "I've always thought that there should be some kind of app that prevents pixels from changing too fast for you guys. - like if it detected too many pure black to pure white in one or two frames, it would kick in and average it to be 50% grey",
            "The thing I noticed on Twitter/Youtube Shorts/Instagram Reels/Reddit, people who use the cry laughter emojis are often terrible people.",
            "I\u2019m curious why? I\u2019ve known people who were falsely accused by malicious people and it\u2019s destroyed them so it feels unfair to put them in the same category as actual predators just for having it said about them. Is it just the association with the topic?",
            "Some managed to get out of false accusations like pyrocynical too",
            "It is the association for me. But at the same time I could see a company like twitch or a toxic person running a smear-type campaign to discredit someone. I guess it sucks my mind automatically goes to  \"creepy vibes/\"I'm out\"\", but I just look at the person different."
