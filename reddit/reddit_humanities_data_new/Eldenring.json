This includes obscure detail questions, \"newbie\" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.\n\nWell written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just don\u2019t like. This includes \u201cso and so boss is stupid and too difficult.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in the game but don\u2019t own it yet, please don\u2019t post \u201cshould I buy this game?\u201d or \u201cIs this game worth it?\u201d. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you haven\u2019t, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And that\u2019s okay!\n\nLastly, be friendly!

I swing really slow and barely get any hit in before I get hit myself. One hit from him and my life is down by 30% - 50%. I do not summon, I do not use spirit ashes. I used this shadow buff to level 3 unfortunately because of this Lion bastard but it didn't help with me dying to a few hits. He keeps healing for some reason which is unfair. I think if he grabs me and chews me out I sparkle red and then when I drink he gets a heal in too, which is so bullshit (not as much as malenia, but still).\nWhat to do other than just grind it out and learn by trial and error? Bullshit boss, too much health, too heavy hits, too fast, too eratic. This is not a really well-thoughout Boss imo.\n\nedit: also forgot to say I am in NG+ if that is of any importance though, probably just makes him 5% harder at worst?",

Patience, timing, knowing when to punish, how long to hold that R2 so it nails him just right, which talismans to take advantage of, etc.\n\nJust felt good.\n\nBy the way, if you parry a lot, maybe think about the Blade of Mercy talisman. I don't know the numbers, but it felt good.",

            "Hey i would like to ask a question. So i have started the dlc again after 2 ish years and i'm getting absolutely slaughtered by the first bosses. I checked a stream on youtube and the bosses don't do nearly as much damage on them as on me. So it just dawned on me... the difference between them and me is that i used my main which is on something like ng+6/7 iirc. My viguour is at 80 which means i have a lot of health, but the bosses still hit me for at least 60% of my health. And unfortunately, the flasks aren't healing much so i need 2 or three of them to heal back to full, leading to a lot of down time. Finally, even my strongest weapon setup make it so that i hit bosses for maybe 5% of their health at most.\n\n  \nSo here is my question, was that a bad idea to do the dlc at ng+6/7 ? (especially after 2+ years of not playing the game). Should I start fresh ?",

            "I have a weird problem!\nso I live in Saudi Arabia, bought an Elden ring disc about a year ago and everything was fine until the DLC of Elden Ring came up and I bought it in this account which is American region and the reason why I bought it in this account is specifically because I have an extra four dollars in my wallet for this account so I added $40 and I bought it and when I try to play the DLC it won't show up ,I looked it up and everybody said go to users and accounts, then go to other then restore license, but it did not work and when I checked for the DLC if it was downloaded or not in the storage and it was! The problem is below the DLC there was a note(main data, not installed in this storage space)! And I remind you, I have the CD for the complete Eldon Ring game! And for my last try I entered the game main menu and went to PlayStation store from inside the game and this error code showed up (ws-116129-0) and it said \"content not found\"\nPlease help me.",
            "I started a new character thinking I'd be ready, but I've been too busy. Entered the DLC at level 90 and only have access to smithing stones 1-4.... I'm getting spanked in there. I do see a lot of smithing stone drops, so can I grind it out inside the DLC, or should I rush through the game to get all the smithing stones? Or it won't matter too much once I level up using the DLC system? I do want to try most of the weapons I find. Thanks",
            "I recently beat the game again as a prophet of lady ranni, I was worried about being over leveled after clearing all the bosses and just not progressing to new game plus, but it seems like from what I\u2019m reading it\u2019s not needed, and I shouldn\u2019t be over leveled.

I beat the game with this build, but coming back to it was rough. Very slow build that takes timing skill I don't have anymore.\n\nSo I switched to a dex/int build to try casting with a katana, but I honestly hate the damage downgrade.\n\nI only have two larval tears left, and I haven't fought the first official boss of the dlc yet. Went in, got spanked by the npc, killed him, went back out to respec to dex, now feel weak as fuck.\n\n**My question**: if I try to build back to my greatsword build, am I going to regret it? It's strong, but very slow.",

Started a 5th run for the DLC, I've been using Blaidd's Royal Greatsword but after >!Dancing Lion!< I don't think it's worth using for the DLC, since you can't really use the AOW against bosses and it has no other bonuses besides looking cool.\n\nI want something flashy that has some weight to the attack but not obnoxiously large like the other Colossal Swords. Darkmoon GS suits my playstyle but I don't want to use the most OP weapon in the game. Was thinking Zwei with Chilling Mist but IDK if it's actually better my current Royal GS, plus my stats are 50 INT/30 STR/18 DEX so I probably can't get the most damage out of it.",

On Fextra, the map is showing only one of them as far as I can tell, but it's decently far-ish from the start of the DLC.

I was looking so forward to trying out this weapon, after going through all those steps to do the Ranni questline and getting the weapon from her. But I've only been disappointed\n\n1. The constant need to charge up the sword. It gets old fast. It's a slow animation - that you have to cast. every. single. time. Before entering a new room? Cast it. Before entering every boss? Cast it. Before getting on your horse? Cast it in case you are suddenly in combat. I wish it was in perpetual Moonlight state\n2. The projectile... man. It's not even an AoE, it's a large ring that gets immediately consumed whenever it hits \\*anything\\*. And I mean anything. Barrels, rats, squirrels, that little bump on the ground, that poorly coded 3D hitbox on the top of the stairs, the sides of a door. You name it. This thing disappears on almost any little bit of hindrance in its path.\n3. Did I mention it's not AoE? It's supposed to be AoE... but it's not. It's an arc... but then it only ever affects one target. Essentially, you're basically just doing Comet spell but slower.\n4. Low range. Keep in mind, so far, Comet is what this weapon is but longer range and better hit detection.\n5. Bosses are just way too fast especially in the DLC, and also dodge your projectiles.\n\nAm I missing something? I genuinely want to know because I'm on the verge of respeccing out of this weapon. And the sad thing is I really love the visuals of it, it's such a pretty weapon.",

            "Even for a \"knight\" (so presumably medium-heavy armor, melee with a focus on sword-and-board, and no or only little supportive magic?) build there are  a ton of ways to build a character. As a general idea of what you might want to focus on:\n\nVigor: Vigor is always a useful investment, *to a certain point*. People on this subreddit tend to advocate for a frankly overkill amount of investment into it, which imo leads to people overestimating themselves and not learning the game properly early on until they hit a wall by mid-lategame.  Since you want to be mostly melee put at least a few points in it early until you can see you have a comfortable cushion for mistakes against the starting area enemies and then consider investing in it again whenever you feel like you're dying too fast to learn an area or a boss properly.\n\nMind: As a non-caster you won't need much if any investment in this, but you might want to put a few points eventually in order to be able to summon stronger Spirit Ashes. Note that the Ash considered universally the most useful/powerful actually costs HP rather than FP to summon so you might be able to get away without any if you wish. (cont).\n\nEndurance: A deceptively powerful stat. Sure, it doesn't increase your damage OR your survivability directly, but Endurance is second only to Vigor in how important it is to your survivability. More Endurance= heavier equipment loads, so you can wear heavier and heavier armor (which makes a big difference in your survivability) while still staying at Medium Load and under. This is critically important, because the different type of rolls you get if you're in Light/Medium/Heavy equipment load have vastly different properties, with Light having a lot of i-frames and opening significant distance from enemies while Heavy \"fatrolls\" are practically a death sentence. Equally as important, Endurance boosts your Stamina and Stamina is your lifeline in everything, ESPECIALLY if you want to use a shield. Everything you do during combat costs stamina. Dodge a hit? Stamina. Block a hit with a shield? Even more stamina. Hit the enemy back during a window? Stamina.  Cast a spell? Believe it or not, again Stamina (and FP)! Stamina management is perhaps the most important skill to master in any Soulslike and having more of it allows you to worry about it less and focus on the actual boss more. \n\nStrength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith, Arcane: The \"damage stats\". I'm lumping them together because what you invest in each of them, if anything, chiefly depends on your build. They all have secondary effects (chiefly Dexterity, which also increases your casting speed for spells and reduces fall damage in the few instances you might take fall damage without dying instantly), but they're most important for what they allow you to do, which is, wield different weapons and incantations/sorceries (armor does not have stat requirements). This is why \"builds\" are most commonly discussed in terms of these stats, as in \"Strength build\", \"Dex build\", \"Intelligence Dexterity build\", \"Dexterity Arcane build\" etc. There are many, many ways to achieve your stated goal of a knight-like build (full strength and two handed weapons, strength/dexterity aka \"quality\" build for certain one-handed swords, Dexterity and/or Arcane for \"trickier\" weapons like curved swords, katana and poleblades, Dex Int for a Magic Knight, Str Fth for a Holy Knight with buffs and healing, etc) and you can pick and choose as you go on your way. There is no \"wrong\" way to play the game (though some will be more efficient than others) and you will unlock the ability to respec all your stats in exchange for a farmable item by early midgame, so don't worry about making bold choices to see where they lead you.",
            "Past a certain point you can change your build to better suit your playstyle.\n\nShields are useful at all times. Either as a way to block damage or to parry an attack to allow for your own.\n\nSamurai is a great starting class. As is Vagabond or Astrologer. And all of them can turn into a formidable knight if that's what you want.",
            "Shields are *absolutely* viable throughout the game, especially if you grab a Greatshield.  If you spec for it with trinkets and shield upgrades, you'll be able to block 100% of physical damage, and your stamina will tick down but a smidge.\n\nSo, it really depends what sort of shield knight you want to be.  Greatshield, as mentioned, or regular shield, of which there are plenty that have 100% negation, with or without upgrades.  Worth noting, no shield is a perfect defense against magic/other elements, but you can still dodge for that.\n\nWeapon wise - can't go wrong with spears or polearms for your shield, since you can attack with the shield up.  Or, go with a more standard longsword or greatsword.  Or really, whatever you fancy.  Just about every build is actually viable, if you have the skill and figure out its quirks.  And with Ashes of War, you can put parry on any shield that doesn't have a bespoke Art of War... though I'd avoid doing so for Greatshields.  Better uses for them than parrying.\n\nOh, one last thing - the 'guard counter' or whatever it's called, is *really* strong.  Immediately after taking a hit on the shield, use a strong attack, and the resulting blow will do increased poise damage.",

            "> I\u2019m seeing a lot of mages being destroyed since they can\u2019t keep their distance\n\nIf any Mage is struggling : a summons helps keep her aggro away from you, especially a more tanky one (I used to swear by Tiche for everything, but for this one I switched to Kristoff or whatever his name is who is a bit more tanky than Tiche). I don't know her resistances but my guess is she is highly Magic Resistant like Rennala (I could be wrong), so I sent a few Ranni's Moon her way to proc Frostbite and a debuff, and then threw lots of Rock Sling her way. Meteorite in off-hand helps with the damage a little. She staggers relatively easy due to the spell too, but I was usually too far away to really take advantage of that with a crit/riposte, however it's good to keep her aggro down. Then for her big AoE moon attack, we actually have a God sent in our OWN Moon Spell? The moon spell makes you levitate for about as long as it takes her attack to go off fully. Such a clutch spell for this. Even if you time it wrong or something, at worst you'll only get hit by one wave - which is fine. For anyone reading this that is lucky enough to have a Mage built, I highly recommend this.",

Hadn't even been to Leyndell before I popped into the Shadow Realm to get the Backhand after I found it on another character.\n\nSince getting the Backhand rolling the spell I actually use most is Hidden Body of all things. Just sneak up behind targets and wallop them with a charged R2, critical, then L2 at whoever took offense to that. She's also wearing the new talisman that boosts attack power after you crit (Blade of Mercy) and the Blessed Blue Dew talisman (which is why I might move some points out of Mind) and rejigger my flask allocation.\n\nBefore I'd even upgraded the Backhand she dealt with that Shield/Mace knight in the southern area of the first DLC map handily.\n\nTL;DR Backhand, Staff of Loss, Small Carian Retaliation shield for parries, Night Maiden armor.\n\nCrimson dagger, Blade of Mercy, Blessed Blue Dew, Green Turtle (at the moment).\n\nNight Sorceries: Night Shard, Night Comet, Night Maiden's Mist, Hidden Body (those are the ones I use most frequently in no particular order)\n\nIt's shaping up to be a lot of fun.",

Bleed and all other status effects also build up faster on enemies the more arcane you have making it even more powerful.\n\nThe Dragon Communion Seal is the only seal in the game that scales primarily with arcane. If you want to use incantations and are playing an arcane build then it is a must. You can use blood incantations to even more greatly put out bleed damage (though I tend to use it more for black flame fireball and lightning bolt).\n\nIt does cause dragon incantations to do more damage - though I find them to be a bit too slow to be of much use (especially given the speed of a lot of enemies in the dlc).",
            "Which arcane weapon is the best to deal physical damage when enemies are resistant to bleed then? And I can also use blackflame incantations with even relatively low faith as they scale off of percentages, right?",
            "Bleed doesn't mean the weapon doesn't do physical damage. Reduvia has strong physical damage (both slash & pierce to boot). You have to get up close in a fight, but it is very fast and it builds bleed up very quickly - and you can use its unique skill to both slow, damage and bleed the enemy from mid-range. \n\n  \nThe only thing you'll need is a weapon that does Strike damage. The Morning Star is the easiest to get - in Limgrave's Weeping Peninsula. Make it an occult weapon (make it scale off arcane).\n\nI don't know exactly how they scale - but stats *always* matter. However, if you are using the Dragon Communion Seal then all your incantations will be scaling off of Arcane. You'll want to level faith enough to use the incantations and weapons you want for your build - and faith still boosts the strength of incantations as well. \n\nHowever, if you're going for an arcane build using Reduvia and Dragon Communion Seal then your primary damage stat is going to be arcane for both your physical weapon (Reduvia) and your incantations. You'll want to raise faith enough to use the incantations you want but otherwise level arcane as your primary damage state, then focus on vigor and mind, then endurance, then faith.",
            "That makes a lot of sense, thanks! What about an occult great stars? I know the strength requirement is rather steep, but would it be worth to two hand? Or am I better off just using a weapon with lower stat requirements and going more arcane?"

            "*Edit: sorry for a titanite slab of a comment, please bear with me and reply if you had a similar experience.*\n\nThanks for making a dedicated thread! I'm on PC, i5-12400, RTX4070, 32Gb RAM, Windows 11, latest Nvidia drivers.\n\n**The way the main game works for me (performance baseline):**\n\n* In open world i get occasional slight drops from 60fps into the 50s and some usual, manageable, Elden Ring world loading stutter.\n* In dungeons and Legacy Dungeons it's a smooth 60fps experience.\n\n**Some notes on the SoTE DLC performance:**\n\n* Open world - pretty much the same deal, maybe slightly more noticeable drops when fighting big enemies and groups.\n* In Legacy Dungeons it's a total mess:\n   * In **Belurat**, which is likely the first one you visit, it stutters around almost every corner like the game is constantly loading big chunks of the map. It's enough to throw off my timing and cause a misstep here and there.\n   * I tried goind the other way and crossed the bridge into **Castle Ensis** - the second Legacy Dungeon. Here i can't even tell if it's stuttering the same because framerate just straight up drops into the 40s and pretty much stays there.  This never happens in the main game, i went back and rechecked - Leyndell and Farum Azula still run at 60fps with no stutter, even the worst FPS drops in the open world don't go as low as in SoTE Legacy Dungeons.\n   * Left **Castle Ensis**, the performance is just too bad.  Went back on the road and followed it south. As soon as i'm back in the open world part, the framerate improves and mostly stays in upper 50s to 60 with declines when fighting groups of enemies. Still not as bad as LDs.\n   * Went through the Dragon Pit cave. Performance near the entrance was quite bad, around 45fps again, but inside the actual cave it stabilised at 60.\n   * The cave eventually leads to the next big open world part - **Jagged Peak,** and this area runs very well all the way to the top despite looking very impressive and having lots of lightning effects going off.  Likely because it's mostly rock geometry which doesn't require as much detail, and there is only a handful of enemies here.\n\nThis is where i stopped playing the DLC for now, as so far it hasn't been a very pleasant experience. I don't want my first impression of these fantastic new areas to be marred by performance issues, and the new enemies to seem more frustrating than they are because of skipped frames.\n\nIt looks to me like the issues are specific to the DLC assets and world streaming. Since FromSoftware had a chance to update the system requirements but stated that they remain unchanged, i guess something is not working as intended and hope this can be addressed in a patch soon.\n\nI might return tomorrow and run through these areas again with a proper CPU/GPU monitor to get a better picture of what's happening, but tbh i'm fairly bummed out right now. Was really looking forward to just getting lost in the DLC.\n\nPlease let me know if there's some place to share this with FromSoftware support, as the form on their website seems to only accept Japanese language.",

            "You can\u2019t complain when you get a recipie for the hefty cracked pots though",
            "We all literally had to kill Mogh to get into the DLC. He drops 420,000 runes in NG.\n\nStop giving me rune consumables worth less than 10,000! 1,000 isn't worth the time it takes to pick them up. 500 is just insulting. And there are so many of them!",
            "I LOVE COOKBOOKS\n\nI LOVE BEING ABLE TO CRAFT ITEMS USING STUFF I FIND OFF THE GROUND",
            "Just wait until you find a \"legendary\" (gold glow) item, just for it to be a great grave glovewort. \n\nI know what you're thinking- that's not so bad actually. Alright, well how about *six of those in the same area*",
            "It's actually kind of crazy that literally 90% of what I'm picking up is useless trash. Why am I getting Somber 1s? HUH?",
            "The moment I realized you can take on the double cat boss by simple hitting one of them with icicles, I have been crafting. It feels OP at times. Yall are missing out.",
            "Too many cooks",
            "This problem is in the base game too. The consequence of the traditional Souls loot system mixing with open world is 90% of the loot being underwhelming or straight up useless.",
            "Best items to find by chance honestly. Can't complain",
            "I love cookbooks!",
            "I get so excited when I pick up a cookbook",
            "Wait till you get to know the Arteria Leaf",
            "At this point, I'm level 274 and I don't really care all that much about leveling up. Puny rune banks thst don't even come close to granting me a level don't mean shit to me, especially when I know I can spend a total of three minutes with Waves of Gold, Golden Fowl Foot, and Golden Scarab in Mohg's palace and I can level up quicker than the game ever could grant me. These puny runes mean nothing to me",

            "The exploration rewards in this DLC is fucking atrocious, it almost makes me not explore. Cookbooks or smithing stones all the time, like just give another vendor that sells everything if the players haven't gotten all the bells for the shops yet. I can already the tell the replayability of this DLC will be rough.",
            "I already gave up on finding cool stuff in the DLC. I think is more about those few bosses that are actually fun to fight. The rest of it is pretty underwhelming and empty",

            "Yeah all the cookbooks are for the most part useless",
            "i love finding cookbooks,  its the smithing stones 1-4 im not that entusiastisk about",
            "it could be worse... starlight shard.",
            "Can you share the template for this?",
            "I fucking hate seeing any color but blue because 95% of the time the item is useless.",
            "Beats being baited by that one leaf in the vanilla game. Besides cookbooks are great. You unlock new things to craft.",

            "Or yet ANOTHER useless crafting item with the recipes right around the corner",
            "Valid complaints, but mostly the point of these kinds of pointless items is to give you confirmation that you've been to that location.",
            "At least it\u2019s not a leave or a rock.\nDafq I\u2019m happy about every book",
            "Not to OP but half of the people argueing about drops being not good enough... HAH!\n\nYou know what sucks? Finding out the 2 weapons you'd want the most, are both late opposing options of a same questline... -\\_-\n\nSo I have to go a long long way until I can enjoy those, together.\n\nAnd here I hear people complain about a a smithing stone drop not being good enough for them...",
            "as a faith build i am extremely disappointed by the loot. every weapon is quality, dex, or stregnth. i found one int sword. i am doubting there are any faith weapons in this dlc. i do not and will never care about cookbooks or crafting. a cookbook as a big shiny is just straight garbo.",
            "Same feeling. But I'm thinking it's probably their way of making us engage with crafting more? I barely crafted anything in the base game. As a tank with dual hammers, I didn't think I needed them. Jump attacks were enough.\n\nNow? Not so much...",

            "Didn\u2019t expect something incredible\u2026",
            "Worse if it's a crafting item. I hate how 70% of loot is just this.",
            "Where are the larval tears. Give me larvals so i can respec and try new weapons",
            "Hey don\u2019t give any hate to the cookbooks, at somepoint if you want to do a perfumer run, or create stuff, it\u2019s a nifty thing to have! Better to have it and not need it, then need it and not have it",
            "At least its not a random flower or some other crafting material. Biggest complaint I ever had with basegame was them putting a craft material as \u201cpurple\u201d rarity. Shit wasn\u2019t funny when I find them bunches after bunches.",
            "On the real could this even been improved. I doubt loot will get patched",
            "I have all the bell bearings for stones so these are all useless to me as I can buy as many as I need. So always a disappointment\n\nI don\u2019t really craft a lot either so I totally get your vibe",
            "I like the big pots tho",
            "I actually don't mind those and find them interesting to see what the new items do. What's getting on my nerves like others have stated is the lower tier(as in, not 7 or 8) smithing stones.",
            "Risk vs reward. You see a purple or gold glowing item being guarded by 3 strong enemies and you gotta wonder if finding out what that item is, is worth it. Maybe it\u2019s a new weapon, armor, spell etc or a hero soul. You just found a nice weapon 5 minutes ago in an easy to access chest so surely this must be better. That\u2019s the whole point I imagine. You gotta weigh the risk vs the reward of the possibility that it might be a good item or just a leaf. This keeps things interesting to me oppose to say the original lords of the fallen where it was a given that anything off the beaten path was always stronger. Then it feels like the game is on rails in which you must always find these paths to properly progress your character.",
            "wait until you find out that they're incredibly useful and exist for a purpose",
            "Glad someome said it, few hours in and haven't found anything particularly useful in the DLC.",
            "Is this family guy?",
            "Or the leaves.",
            "I just wish I could find a Reverse Grip Sword. - cries -\nIt was my most hyped weapon since I saw it in that trailer and I still haven't found one. haha",
            "Lmfaooo this was me looking for scadutree blessings",
            "Dude, I get so excited when I find new cookbooks. Two years ago when I last played I found all of them but now I have a whole new collection to find! I use crafting A LOT",
            "I seem to have gathered lots of cookbooks but haven\u2019t really unlocked anything new to actually craft.",
            "Nah give me those red leaves.",
            "I was so excited to find an invisible wall in the dlc, only to find another cookbook lol. At least it was a decent one.",
            "and you dont even craft anything good lol",
            "If I don't like dark souls, is there a chance I'll like Elden Ring? I love the Witcher...",
            "I'm glad we've got more smithing stones, tbh, so I can upgrade the stuff I find!",
            "I love to find cook books\u2026 Better than one of those damn red leaves I never use and can farm later at the mountaintops of the giants. Or a stupid gravel stone.",
            "Lul play a build where consumables matter and i guarantee you will have a completely different play through of elden ring. Survival playthrough without farming for runes via golden path, etc.",
            "I still find it insane that from insists on locking some of the coolest looking armor and weapons behind mindlessly farming enemies rather than have them as rewards for dungeons et cetera. Not only would the farming problem be solved, but also the lackluster rewards. \n\nIt's such a no brainer, but they'll take at least 5 games to implement the change because they're fromsoft. Took them that long to remove useless durability.",
            "Nah cooking books are fine\n\nAshes on the other hand make me rage",
            "So far ,I'm not very far into the game,I have broken runes crafting supplies,a cook book ad a talisman \n\n\n\nI'm sure I will find more stuff ,sooner or later \n\nI'm not worried  or bitching about stuff",
            "Or a fucking arterea leaf",
            "Starlight shards are at least usefulnif you want dung eaters ashes.",
            "Those restore FP gradually. If there was a consistent way to farm them they'd be a Godsend.",
            "Honestly i feel like they kinda fucked up. 95% of the drops and shinies are completely useless for this point in the game. \n\nBig shrine guarded by enemies what could this be...(3) somber smithing stone...amazing",
            "If you think about the DLC as the final content chronologically then yes but if you think about it in terms of game progression then the area is a gold mine. You can finish Varre\u2019s quest line right as you reach the lakes, or if you don\u2019t PvP by reaching the NPC in Altus Platue by bypassing the lift. You instantly get transported to Moghs palace and enter the DLC which has a plethora of smithing stones from 1s to the illusive 7s. Then you even have mobs you can farm that drop a wide range of smithing stones including bosses that drop the Ancient Dragon Smithing stones that is basically an end game item which you\u2019re getting you hands on before even reaching the capital.",
            "I love exploring but were the rewards this bad in the main game? I know the herba from a cave was a big meme but usually you could find some cool talisman, in the shadow lands I find so many bodies with just +10 arrows, thanks I guess.",
            "I think them adding lower level smithing stones is kinda smart though. If players are missing the bell bearings to buy them, they don't really have to go back to the main game to farm them and play with the new weapons.",
            "Smithing stones are good since I get to upgrade weapons.\n\nBut yeh, bronen runes are a bummer.",
            "You can never have too much dung",
            "Why is it always dung?",
            "Finding 4x Smithing Stone 4 instead of a single one is pretty great.\n\nBut I still feel jebaited when I pick up 10x Melting Mushrooms or worse, 5x glass shards.",
            "Hey as someone who likes to change weapon like u change underwear, I love the extra smithing stuff, means I don't need to spend souls on buying them",
            "Lol calling half these cook books \u201cuseful\u201d is a stretch for more players.",

            "or x10 arrows lol",
            "Arteria Leaf is priceless! I'll fight Malenia over it or more realistically, I'll farm trolls for it!\n\nThe exalted flesh, perfumes... are divine especially so when your build can't use seals or doesn't have the stats requirements for buffs.",
            "I've just found the one Great Ghost Glovewart so far (in the same catacomb as a spirit ash). I'm thirsty for more, as a spirit ash collector. They can't Sophie's Choice me between all these weird little goblins!",
            "The one area is only gloveworts",
            "Bro I've found 4 legendaries and thet were just 2 marikas blessings and two great glove warts, actually a troll lol",
            "There is literally nothing more demotivating than these like damn let me toggle them out of the game or something I don't want NPCs to play the game for me",
            "There is so much of them, I think they are making a point about using summons being a totally legit way to play. Which, for some reason, is controversial in community.",

            "Hefty Volcano Pots. A certain annoying recurring miniboss will take upwards of 30k from one.",
            "I have crafted some pots so my mimic can use them.\n\nI hate crafting in most games.",
            "I craft shit to sell",
            "Yeah I don't craft anything either. Having limited resources in trial and error game is so dumb.",
            "Same. My build isn't exactly consumable based, so it's not like I don't have them if I do decide to use them. \n\nPlus the majority of what I use would be greases, but my weapon doesn't allow them so... What's the point?",
            "There's more than one.\u00a0 You\u00a0didn't... you didn't kill all of them did you",
            "Yoooo what. I killed him too. Found out he has something from your post just now?",
            "Bro I fuxking killed that guy so fast and was immediately like shit was that a friendly",
            "Broooo i wrongly killed a rotbug now i think i broke a quest",
            "Why you kill cool bug boi \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Weirdly enough I found one in one area already dead and when I walked over the cook book just spawned in my inventory.",
            "I also love collecting them but I like to stock up all the time on everything.",
            "who are you talking about? gowry?",
            "wait who??",
            "Just found a rune consumable worth 80k. And the itty-bitty runes are nice for shopping and topping off a level.",
            "Yesss! My character is like lvl 150+ and the runes required to lvl up is so massive that getting only 1000 per broken rune or whatever? Useless.",
            "I do appreciate them cumulatively when I\u2019m juuust a bit shy on leveling up some weapon or myself, mass sell em to hewg before resorting to rune arcs, rowa and the like- don\u2019t mind them so much as the placement choices in the world, such a tease!",
            "Speak fa yaself, i went into the dlc underleveled. The runes are much appreciated",
            "Literally",
            "Yeah consumables for runes are the absolute last thing I need. If I need runes for something, I just spend 30 seconds in Mohgwyn Palace and I have 200k+",
            "Gotta be honest, I almost never used any runes in the game. By the time I beat the original game I had millions-worth of runes in my inventory, had stopped even using runes to level because I feel like over ~150 is getting overleveled and would rather buy infinite crab, so getting more runes for the pile is a fun game at this point. I usually give them to my friend in big chunks so he can try and catch up because he loves dying twice and losing all his boss runes before using the, somehow.",
            "Same! I keep picking up resources that say, \"used to craft\" and thinking, \"where the hell is the cookbook for this?!\"",
            "Totally. Especially the consumables in the DLC are actually really strong and useful",
            "\\*looks at the like 50 spirit summons I want to max out from the base game alone\\* I'll fucking take them! I hate limited final upgrade materials like great gloveworts and ancient smithing stones, the dlc can rain as many as it wants on me and I'll be happy lol.",
            "sounds amazing, i need to top off all my pokemon.",
            "In case you don't have the bell bearings and want to upgrade all your cool new weapons, probably",
            "What made DS 1 so amazing. Was that it felt so hard that any cheese or strategy you could come up with was viable and the devs encouraged it. Every game after that felt the same way. \n\n\"Here is a hard fight we designed. Use whatever resources available to you and we will applaud.\"\n\nSomething that I think was lost after DS 1 was the stage/level was part of the boss fight. You sometimes had to fight past a bunch of enemies just to get to the fight. And once you killed a boss, you had to fight your way back out of a level because of no teleporting.",
            "Guy who skips playing the game tells me I'm the one missing out \ud83e\udd14",
            "Couldn't agree more. Just finished up another crabs treasure and even though it's a much more simple souls game, everything you pick up feels necessary",
            "I thought so too at first, but after playing through the game with a few different builds it surprised me to see that almost every loot *is* actually useful depending on how you play. If you want to engage with the crafting, all those mushrooms and arteria leafs are suddenly very precious, if you want to play an archer all those Golden Runes (1) are now an excellent source of arrows, etc.\n\n\nIt's not that the loot is bad - it's that Elden Ring is such a wide RPG that they have to account for so many builds that no loot is ever universally useful.",
            "Is there still a palace rune farming spot?  I tried yesterday and it did not work",
            "Everyone acts like elden ring is a 10 out of 10 and I freaking love the game, but yeah that's an issue in my eyes a lot of the consumables feel useless or just not really needed",
            "There are a lot of faith weapons, it\u2019s been irritating me lol",
            "Isn\u2019t there like 30 incantations tho? I\u2019ve found one cool faith weapon that\u2019s a bitch to farm",
            "They\u2019re in here, they look specific once you find one you\u2019ll know",
            "This is honestly my biggest gripe with the games mechanics. I ended up just using chest engine to give myself like 100 larval tears. I love finding and trying new builds and its dumb you're restricted to a certain number per run",
            "usually those are rarer materials for stuff like damage buffs and shit",
            "Wasn't it really early on? I swear it was one of the first things i found",
            "Don't you dare diss the arteria leaf, one of the most useful crafting ingredients. \n\nI NEED MY EXALTED FLESH!!!",
            "For real though. Istg I'll have a whole ass garden of arteria leaves soon \ud83d\ude2d",
            "What? Arteria leaves are just, by far, the best item in the game.",
            "Salty about getting the hands down best crafting material? Just cause y'all refuse to craft doesn't mean the loot is bad.",
            "You know, now that I think about it I have not seen arteria leaves in the DLC at all",
            "Pretty good consumable too, but just not very interesting as a pick up",
            "I mean, with the new charm they're kinda redundant now.",
            "There's a beastman type that drops them in the DLC",
            "The drop table definitely feels like a beta in certain sections of the game. I found a hidden chest tucked away and inside was a Smithing Stone (6)...",
            ">Honestly i feel like they kinda fucked up. 95% of the drops and shinies are completely useless for this point in the game.\n\nMost drops and items are useless in SoulsBorne games, me thinks.\n\nLike, oh boy, an item that lets me get 200 Souls in one of the last areas of the game.",
            "While I agree with you, it\u2019s nice to have lower smithing stones while exploring to upgrade the new weapons (that would be true if I hadn\u2019t stockpiled a shitton of them)",
            "for casuals who might not even know about the ball bearings it might be useful",
            "Man am I the only one that loves getting all these smithing stones? It encourages you to try out many different types of weapons",
            "they probably are giving us stuff to level up the new weapons, and the rarest stones are some of the mid level ones",
            "I agree, it's tailored to a more early to midgame first time run than like, a late to ng+ run, which is kinda weird considering mohg is a pretty late boss for most people",
            "Totally agree. I was expecting only the max tier smithing stones from a dlc. The bell bearings are still a far better option for leveling up weapons than running around for three hours on a treasure hunt for each smithing stone tier.",
            "Did you not play the base game? The base game was basically figuring out how to get to the shiny just so you can get \"arteria leaf\" or \"mushroom x5\".",
            "OMG, the smithing stones are crazy. Fromsoft, your game has been out for 2 year and you know everyone is running around with a lol 150+ character. WHY would be need a somber smithing 3? Love the cookbooks though",
            "This 1000%, also doesn't help for how goddam hard everything hits and how everything in this DLC has a base like 2000+ health minimum, most enemies only drop like 1500 runes making them not even worth fighting.\n\nI've gotten to the point where at least in the open world I'm ignoring pretty much 100% of the enemies because of that.\n\nI'm not going to waste the time or flasks for like 2 mid tier smithing stones and a hand full of runes.\n\nThey should have gone the route of introducing some sort of new upgrade system, and just make it like the buffs we can find the materials for and level where it only works in the DLC, at least then we can catch up to the power creep of every boss 2-3 shotting us while also having more health that the Fire Giant...",
            "I found them quite useful considering I never grinded out that many stones in the base game, or at least I used a lot of them. So with all the drops I'm getting now I can upgrade all these new weapons without the hassle of grinding it out again through genocide.\n\nPlus I guess it's good for players who aren't getting into the dlc post base game and don't have much at the point.",
            "That's how they always do things. Shit tier smithing stones in the last area of the game.",
            "Not only are most of the drops useless, but there are SO many empty areas with literally nothing to find.\n\nThe base game does a really good job of making sure that every ounce of curiosity you have is rewarded. Every nook, every cranny, every single time you go \"I wonder what's over here\" there is something to find. Even though most of the time it's nothing exciting, you still got *something* for going out of your way to look.\n\nBut in the DLC, I find myself CONSTANTLY being disappointed by a general lack of stuff to find. Areas that would have 4-5 things to find and pick up if it was in the base game have literally nothing. I find myself thinking \"why is this little area even here if there's nothing to pick up\" all the time. \n\nIt honestly feels like Miyazaki said \"we are going to make the DLC about the size of limgrave\". And then the item designers rolled with that info while the world designers went absolutely crazy and made it 5x bigger, which made it so all the items had to be spread out super thin.",
            "> Big shrine guarded by enemies what could this be...(3) somber smithing stone...amazing\n\nY'all complaining, and yet here I am not minding it too much because it allows me to upgrade the new weapons I find without having to farm Runes for it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Golden Order Pots are a must have against Death Ritual Birds (not so much holy grease, the extra damage is mediocre against them), and Poison/Bleed grease are great ways to proc talismans without using FP (which is great for Strength/Dex/Quality builds not focused on status).\n\nCold Grease was a major player in defeating Mohg under leveled, though you do need to have the Consecrated Snowfield unlocked to be able to create an infinite amount of cold Grease.\n\nConsumables make this game a lot more manageable.

The treasure aspect of the DLC is a solid B-/B.",

            "rather than using time as the metric its more fare to say that while mohg is endgame level in power, especially with how weak he is to bleed it isn't a stretch to get to the dlc very early given that due to the lack of mandatory progression radahn and mohg can be your first two great rune bosses.\n\n If you are good at the game and know a few decent pickups/quick runes to grab you can easily enter the dlc early where having spare low level materials are a nice way to pad the drop tables rather than just having nothing at all as it has niche uses for some people. whereas places like snowfield, haligtree, mountaintops, farum  etc are undeniably lategame as there is significant mandatory story progression that locks you out of these locations.\n\nThose materials are honestly a nice system that means on a new playthrough you have the option of routing to the dlc early if there are particular weapons you like there or bosses you enjoy without feeling like you have to progress through to 75% of the game to be able to upgrade your items.",

By the time you defeat mohg, you should have ever bell bearing for smithing and somber stones, so with that being said, the lower tier smithing and sombers in the DLC are useless. It\u2019d be nice if they replaced all of them with ancient sombers and smithing stones.",
            "let\u2019s say i didn\u2019t want to level up past 150 but still love helping people in coop. So I used all the runes to invest in Smithing Stones, better than losing them all to a random enemy or a fall from the cliffs.",

I think 2 moves that are difficult to dodge with massive damage that fucks up summons and ashes and one in particular that absolutely wipes them off the playing field regardless of their health... Which is fucked up because that makes the NPC summon basically a trap - you need another player for that if you don't wanna do it alone.\n\nSo that also makes her much more difficult than Malenia because the one attack just removes Tiche entirely. I think they actually need to tune the NPC's AI higher so they can at least dodge the one move that will completely kill them if they live that far.",

If they just had random respawnable enemies dropping the last upgrade materials it eliminates some of the incentive to start a new game plus.",

            "That's what I did! I stayed at 150 for the main game but kept helping people deal with the 3 main bosses. I had 100 of each of the regular smithing stones and about 30 of each of the other smithing stones when I started the dlc.",

Quality over quantity always.\n\nI told him Altus has less area than Limgrave, but it's denser and has more verticality. Not surprised that this was the case. It's so dense and it is so incredibly vertical. Also quality over quantity. It seems to have far less minidungeons, but those that are there are so unique and big. \n\nMan I thought I couldn't be more impressed after Elden Ring and they somehow topped the base game in terms of design.",

I'm lucky enough to not have too many performance issues in the base game on PC, with a locked 60 fps throughout the game and only like one boss fight (Fortissax) consistently dropping below that, and some minor occasional traversal stutter. Meanwhile the DLC has entire areas running at 45-50 fps for no discernible reason. I've noticed waterfalls in particular tend to kill the framerate, even when they're occluded behind something, and CPU and GPU usage are both too low to justify the drops as well.

Half of the time, I kill the mobs and wonder why because theres nothing of substance in the area to do or collect (only consumables etc, that 90% of the player base wont use).  I thought they said that this map wouldnt be like the lands between and would have more in it but Im still waiting to see that cos that is not the case so far.",
            "Okay after reading peoples comments and trying to understand how they think, I think to a lot of ppl, bigger = better.\n\nThe maps bigger, dungeons are bigger and so even if there isnt much in them or their designs are just okay, the fact that its big and \u2018elden ring\u2019 and difficult is what makes people happy with whatever in this game.

Im assuming that the rest of the dlc is gonna be similar to it.\n\nThen you have a bunch of areas to explore that are again smaller and connected to more areas in general via exploration and not just a linear walk from one main area to the other.\n\nSo im kinda surprised by people saying theres nothing to do. Also i feel like ive already talked to more characters in the dlc than all the characters in the main game combined, and there's new lore from all directions.\n\nSo all in all, I've done more exploring, fought more enemies, seen more interesting dungeons, caves, and legacy dungeons, fought more new and novel enemies, found out more lore snipets and talked to more npcs in a shorter amount of time than at any point in the main game.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, how the game is \"denser\" than the main game.",

            "So far, Ive explored quite a lot and only found a select few weapons and ashes of wars. Idk tbh, it just felt like Ive done quite a lot of running and not really found much. I agree that the environment looks gorgeous but Im here for to fight stuff, not look at the pretty drawings around me yk?\n\nAlso I wouldve liked for a few more new mobs or something. These new mobs honestly feel like reskins with longer combos but maybe im just complaining now lol.",
            "\"Nothing to do\" is an exaggeration, but I've played for about 15 hours so far and uncovered what feels like 70% of the map and I do feel like the density of actual points of interest is noticeably lower than in the main game. Hell, it feels even lower than Mountaintops/Snowfield, areas which are notorious for \"being empty\". Maybe I just suck at finding stuff, but I feel I'm exploring pretty thoroughly (which only makes this worse because I spend so long riding on Torrent looking at every nook and cranny of the overworld only to be disappointed).\n\nThat said, the very few side dungeons that I have found are noticeably more developed than most in the base game. While that is great and I'm all for quality over quantity, it feels like the map size is even more of a mismatch for the amount of content than the base game map. Limgrave for example may be full of rather simple dungeons and ruins, but it *is* full of them, while so far this has felt more like if you took the area depicted in the post image but slashed the amount of POIs to 20%.\n\nOnce I \"finish\" the DLC I'll look up a map and hopefully find out I've missed a ton of stuff, but that won't really fix the initial experience feeling kinda eh.",
            "Yeah i guess its just differences in opinion. You enjoy more of the rpg aspect and i enjoy the collecting stuff to go clobber with more, it seems.\n\nLike i think we even see the map differently because I believe that you genuinely think its dense but to me, it just feels a bit empty and boring when travelling between zones/bosses and that makes the game feel quite boring.",

            "I am so confident that every single person who has downvoted you has only seen 20% of the map.\n\nThis dlc is front loaded to hell. The first few areas are extremely dense. But the later areas like the Finger Ruins, the Hinterlands, the *other* Finger Ruins, the Dragon Peak, and more are just completely devoid of content. You will run around looking for *anything* to do. No caves, no loot, often times not even enemies. The only enemies in the entire Hinterlands are some reused tree sentinels and a fallingstar beast, even though it's visually one of the coolest parts of the whole game. \n\nI love certain areas of this dlc, but other parts are straight up filler. They wanted the map to look big, there is no other reason why 1/3rd of the map has to be empty Finger Ruins and fields of nothing.",
