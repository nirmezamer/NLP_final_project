He finds out that she was originally a nurse until her friend was killed, turning her against the ISOs. Beck sees that she\u2019s actually really selfless and still wants to help people in her current role. Eventually, she breaks\u00a0up with him because the relationship is *too* good. An encounter with Beck in costume makes her feel that she needs to double down on the path she\u2019s on instead of happiness in her personal life. She never found out that it was Beck all along.

Hence the origin of the \"Square\", since both heroes are in love with each others' opposite identities.\n\nFor villains (and not counting the ones turned into a Villain by dark magic)? Hawk Moth absolutely despises Ladybug and Chat Noir since they constantly foil his plans to steal the Miraculouses that give them their powers. *Gabriel Agreste*, on the other hand, greatly respects Marinette Dupain-Cheng's raw talent as a fashion designer (he owns his own fashion label) and a great deal of his villainous actions are fuelled by love for his son Adrien.\n\nAlso, F\u00e9lix Fathom hates Ladybug due to how strict she is with how she imposes rules over the Miraculouses and their respective Kwamis >!due to how F\u00e9lix was enslaved and tortured by his own father.!< He likes Marinette enough that when he becomes a major villain in Season 5, he spares her life during a major attack and ends it prematurely because he thinks she was mistakenly killed. >!Once he realises they are one and the same and Marinette is genuinely looking out for the Kwamis' best interests, he goes from \"Villain\" to neutral and helps her defeat his uncle!<.\n\nEdit: Also, not a villain example but this is part of the drama in Season 3 of Bridgerton.\n\nColin absolutely hates the gossip columnist Lady Whistledown for her actions over the first two seasons, where she ruins the lives and reputations of people close to him and his family by exposing some deep-seated secrets. Unfortunately for him, he ends up in a relationship with her real self, >!Penelope Featherington.

            "I don\u2019t know if we can ever *truly* guess as to what would happen if they did. At the Council of Elrond, either Elrond or Gandalf (cannot recall off the top of my head) said that the Valar would refuse to accept it. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think the Valar would be corrupted by the ring. I don\u2019t really have any evidence to back this up, but the fact is that everyone who could have wrestled it from Sauron\u2019s control but still be corrupted - Gandalf, Galadriel\u2026 maybe Elrond - were not as powerful as Sauron. His corrupted essence tainted the ring. But the Valar are far more powerful than him. I think the ring would be a trinket to them as it would be for Bombadil. \n\nBut it could be abused if it fell into the hands of the elves living there.",
            "The Valar are more powerful than Sauron so it is safe to assume the One Ring wouldn't have any power over them. The problem would be getting it to the Undying Lands in the first place without the ring sensing what is happening and tempting someone into taking it back to Middle Earth. Remember that the entire reason Frodo left the Fellowship was because Borimir fell under the ring's influence and tried to take it from him. He couldn't guarantee that anybody else wouldn't feel prey to the One Ring.\n\nIf you have a ship full of people then it increases the danger that someone will fall prey to the One Ring, or worse, you will have multiple people fall prey and the ring will drive them to kill each other.",
            "At the council of Elrond, he reveals they would refuse to take it.\n\n  \n\"But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,' said Elrond. 'And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.\"",
            "The Valar would not have taken the Ring, probably not even give it asylum.",
            "The Ring would be in the Undying lands. Sauron can no longer recover it and the power he placed in it.\n\nBUT Sauron would still be in action and without the ring being destroyed the can no longer do anything to stop his takeover. Even without the ring, Sauron wasn't something the people of middle earth could face at that point in time,",
            "The Valar would sink the ship, kill everyone on board, and probably send teams to murder everyone who heard of the mission. They're murderous bastards.",
            "The Valar would have refused passage to the boat carrying the ring.\n\nIf for some reason they didn't, I don't doubt that Aul\u00eb would be perfectly capable of unmaking the ring",
            "Almost certainly yes.\n\nThe Valar are magnitudes more powerful than Maia and one of the Valar residing in the Undying Lands is Aul\u00eb, the greatest craftsman in existence and the one who actually though Sauron the craft of forging. \n\nFor Aul\u00eb unmaking the One Ring would be an easy task to accomplish. Them not admitting the One Ring to the Undying Lands is just another example of their pattern of avoiding responsibility for what's clearly a problem they should be dealing with.\n\nAs a side note, the concern of destruction and collateral damage in Middle Earth is also blown out of proportion. The only reason the War of Rath was so destructive is bcs the Valar were fighting one of their own, Morgoth, arguably the most powerful of them all, while on his home turf (Morgoth has expended much of his essence into the matter of Middle Earth making it his own \"ring\" of sorts). The armies on both sides were of an unimaginable scale and the entities involved were powerful and at the peak of their abilities. The opening confrontation of the war was the destruction of Morgoth's orc army which was counting in the tens of millions.\n\nSauron on the other hand is a mostly depowered Maia who can barely hold a physical form without the Ring and a million orcs top, with a couple of emaciated ghosts as bodyguards.\n\nA squad of high elves with a Valar could walk up to the black gates, bitch slap Sauron out of Barad-d\u00fbr and drag his sorry ass to the undying lands to bitchslap him a second time over the Door of Night without any casualty.",
            "Feanor 2, the mythic boogaloo.",
            "It seems like if the Valar cared enough about Sauron to send the Istari, they should have been more than happy to do something if they had the chance to safely come into possession of the Ring",
            "Good point, you can walk yourself to mt doom but you can't really row a boat to valinor\ud83d\udea3",
            "Exactly. A lot of people seem to forget that destroying the Ring was the only way to stop Sauron. Sauron didn't need the Ring to win, the free peoples needed to destroy the Ring to not lose.",
            "Vanyar hit squads with automatic bows that flow from the old light of the Two Trees",
            "Also, ultimately it won't solve any problem to have the ring out of saurons's grasp, he would still crush the world. The ring represents the majority of his personal power, but even without it he had almost no peers left in middle earth and legions at his command.",
            "The Istari were sent to guide and inspire, not to rule middle earth.\n\nTaking care of middle earth's problems for them would be wrong.",
            "If it was simply a matter of keeping the Ring away from Sauron they could have thrown the Ring into the ocean like one of the Silmarils. The implication of sending it to valinor is that the Valar would do something with it once in their possession.",
            "Sauron is a maiar, which makes him a problem of the maiar and Valar. The Istari guide and influence because the Valar forbid them from taking direct action against him. By that logic Gandalf should have just left the fellowship to deal with the balrog too since it is a maiar just like Sauron.",
            "They can unmake it no more then the fellowship can.  The magic of its making is such that it could only be destroyed the way that it was. For the valar to help in any way more than they did would require that they return to middle earth themselves and make a second war of wrath, and for all we know the would have been barred passage on the narrow road, which was intended to keep middle earth and valinor separate as much as linked.",
            "They aren't forbidden from taking direct action, they're forbidden to make full use of their powers 24/7, or to cow, rule or awe the people of Middle Earth, or for petty reasons.\n\nThey can and do use their powers to tip the scales against evil, or to help out here and there to avoid unnecessary suffering, but they aren't there to carry the mortals of Middle Earth, they're there to guide them into their own strength. It's important that Middle Earth gain independence and their own competency.\n\nWhen Gandalf fought the Balrag, that was him using his full, unrestrained powers because the Balrag shouldn't be there, it was a creature of the same type as Gandalf, and was too powerful for anyone else to take on. If I remember my lore correctly, Gandalf and the Balrag are actually cousins, so it was rather personal for him too.",
            "Gandalf was using his powers to protect the fellowship and allow them to continue their mission. In times of overwhelming opposition he\u2019s \u201callowed\u201d to use more of his native abilities, and this is such a case because without him doing so they wouldn\u2019t be able to complete their mission. \n\nHe was essentially acting in defense of his friends, he didn\u2019t set out to kill a balrog from the beginning. \n\nPerhaps he would be allowed to do the same if Sauron showed up out of the blue, but obviously that is not a realistic scenario.",
            "Take it up with the Valar then."

            "He is?\n\nConstantine fucks up his plans constantly. The most common Hellblazer plotline is \"Constantine's drunken, reckless, half assed scheme blows up in his face and seriously traumatises/cripples/kills one or multiple of his friends/acquaintances/former friends that hate him.\"\n\nBatman messed up a lot too, but he usually takes the situation seriously and tries his utmost best. He doesn't just muck around for fun, or underestimate his opponents, or do something dumb because of petty ego or malice or fear, unlike Constantine.\n\nAnd Batman is a highly educated, bona fide genius, who can be considered a leading expert in multiple fields. He spent years diligently training his craft under top masters - including Zatara, one of Constantine's old mentors.\n\nMeanwhile, Constantine has a good understanding of the magical world, has a (shrinking) network of contacts, and is very cunning - but he's no genius, and definitely not the leading expert in any field of magic. He relies more on \"street knowledge\" i.e. rumours/gossip, rather than focused study.\n\nHe's mostly a conman desperado that's good at bamboozling people, and leveraging his overinflated reputation. He's the most accomplished conman in the magical world - but  even Constantine admits that was mostly just dumb luck and bravado.\n\nConstantine's probably better characterised as a better gambler than Batman. Batman would never risk the lives of innocents, especially not on improbable long shots. If Joker confronted him with some sadistic trolley problem, he'd begrudgingly go for the most rational, utilitarian approach, or try to rescue everyone. He wouldn't be the one setting up the trolley in the first place. Meanwhile, Constantine's much more likely to go all in and put everything on the line, up to and including the fate of human civilisation itself. Escalation and recklessness is the name of the game, with him.",

            "Both in general are not so good strategists (tell me a constantine and batman plan that has worked 100% of expectations and even if so, that has not had any unforeseen or unintended consequences).\n\n\nThe difference is that while batman has all the resources a human could have(virtually unlimited money,extensive network of allies and informants,encinclopedic knowledge of literally every scientific or philosophical area of humanity being trained in every possible aspect of normal human knowledge and having alfred)and his gallery of villains although dangerous rarely get to be more than a city level threat being\n\n\nConstantine does not have as many resources and has a (dwindling) network of allies and faces beings that could destroy them in seconds (and some have country or planetary level in terms of destruction they can generate) and usually comes out on top in those situations as the only major factor Constantine has are his cons (which require planning),as for example when he had cancer and somehow managed to sell his soul to the 3 most powerful demons in hell causing that every time he dies they revive him as he could create a war in hell to be the first to torture him (trusting that the demons would never stoop to work together).\n\n\nIt would be like batman hunting rabbits with top of the line equipment and armor and jonh being forced to hunt bears with a small knife.\n\n\nBecause if batman is defined as the pinnacle of humanity in terms of skills, jonh would be like the pinnacle of humanity in terms of skills.\u00a0\nwould be like the pinacula of cons.",

He's like 3/4ths of a Batman without actually trying all that hard.

            "fair enough, though a big reason why Constantine constantly finds himself in these jams is the synchronicities caused by his Laughing Magician heritage. \n\nOn one hand, he can instinctively bend fortune to his favour via synchronicity wave travelling. Like handily winning at horse race betting whenever he really needed some extra cash, (and losing whenever he didn't need it that badly) Or the Hellblazer classic, barely surviving whatever latest nonsense he's embroiled himself into thanks to a last minute deus ex machina. \n\nOn the other hand - the Laughing Magician bloodline are cursed to defy gods and demons and powerful spirits. Constantine will always end up fighting life and death battles against beings that, by all rights, should be able to squash him like an ant.\n\nConstantine's internal narration often has him going \"Oh no, I've finally bitten off more than I can chew, enough fucking around.\" - and that's usually when he manages to pull some brilliany scheme out of his butt at the last second. It comes from a place of desperation more than anything.",
