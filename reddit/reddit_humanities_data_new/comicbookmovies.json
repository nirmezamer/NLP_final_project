We do allow these kinds of topics to be posted on Sundays 12AM ETS, but they must also follow the rest of the rules for this sub to be allowed.\n\nReddit, along with other social media, has been overflowing with scam and bot accounts in recent years.

Some reasons the automod may ban your account are, but not limited to:\n\n\\- Your account is new and/or low karma\n\n\\- It detects your IPS Address coming from a known spam/bot Address\n\n\\- You had a previous account already banned\n\nIf you believe your account was ban inappropriately, please message the sub itself about this issue. When messaging, please be respectful and understanding of the situation. If you are disrespectful and inappropriate, we will likely keep the ban in place. Personally messaging Mods will also result in the ban staying in place. Reply to the ban message respectfully, and a mod will get to you as soon as possible.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to yourself and will help you while being apart of this sub.
