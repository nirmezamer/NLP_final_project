Are they success-driven? Would they want you to continue with this university or consider this a sign you aren't ready for it? Would they cut you off? Would they pay for tutoring?\n\n\nBefore you come up with the correct way of telling them, you need to have a plan for going forward.",

I hope they\u2019ll understand.\n\nAnd if you dont want to go to that uni, tell them i couldnt give my best, and will not be able to do any better even if i try again, because its just not what i want.\nJust dont think too much and tell them.",

She's very kind and supportive, however ever since my husband and I got together, she's told me that she's always wanted a daughter named \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, but she only had boys. She always speaks about my future baby, referring to it as \\_\\_\\_\\_, but I really don't like that name, and I don't know how I'd feel about MY own baby having a name I didn't choose myself...considering that I'm the one that has to be pregnant. I feel as if I were to tell her no, she'd feel as if I betrayed her. I just don't want to be on bad terms with her considering everything she's done for me. Should I find middle ground with her? like maybe using it as a second name? ",

            "Your husband needs to shut this down, not you. Anything you do or say will just create problems. \n\nIt has nothing to do with liking the name choice or not, naming your child is a personal decision between the parents of said child.",

You wouldn't be betraying your mother in law- you don't owe her this no matter how much she talks about it. You *can* find a middle ground if you want, but you're not obligated to by any stretch of the imagination.       \n        \nAs far as how to tell her- directly, compassionately, and firmly. Honestly your partner should probably be doing most of this, or at least you should *both* do it, but either way she needs to understand that her *grand*daughter isn't the daughter she never had. Doesn't mean you don't want her to be a huge part of your daughter's life, she just needs to respect you and your partner's boundaries, same as any other relationship. Good luck!",
            "Something I\u2019ve noticed about our parents generation is that they allowed their parents to live vicariously through them because that\u2019s just \u201chow it was\u201d so they expect to be able to do the same thing with their children. They paid their dues to their parents, now they\u2019re owed (whether they realize it that literally or not).\n\nOne example we encountered was my MIL wanting to be at the hospital while I gave birth because both her mother and MIL were there when she did. \n\nIt can be really uncomfortable to be the one who is trying to break that cycle. Like others have mentioned, it really is up to your husband to handle this confrontation. A mother will always forgive her own child, but you\u2019re right in worrying that she may harbor resentment towards you over a conflict. If I\u2019m honest? Cross that bridge when you come to it. Don\u2019t even worry about having the conversation until you know you\u2019re going to have a baby girl. Otherwise it might all be a moot point. I get that it\u2019s frustrating to hear/deal with, but it will get easier to ignore over time. \n\nIf you\u2019re open to it as a middle name, maybe consider that. The tradition in my family is to have the middle name have family ties, but the first name belong totally to the child and be \u201cfor them\u201d. Just throwing it out there in case you like the sound of that idea. You\u2019re in no way obligated to use the name at all. \n\nYour MIL will already play a big part in any future daughter\u2019s life as their grandma - she doesn\u2019t need any mama responsibilities. Naming a baby is a parent thing, not a grandparent thing.",
            "You feel she'd feel betrayed. You are letting your feelings control your life long decisions and in this instance these feelings are not good guides. You're trying to reason with fear - your fear that your mother in law will be angry, will reject you or will feel hurt. Whatever she'll feel about your kids name is not your concern. You are not responsible for making her happy, for supporting her, for realising her dreams or helping her to deal with disappointment. It's her task and her friends'.",
            ">she's told me that she's always wanted a daughter named _____, but she only had boys.\n\nShe didn't have the chance to name her daughter, so she will take your chance to name your own daughter. Really !!",

You don\u2019t want to name your kid this name. Nor donuts want it as a pet name. \n\nThat you being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she suddenly gets a vote. The grandparent title is granted to her by the mean that you respect her son enough to make a kid with him there are privileges to that title like they can be proud and are there to spoil the kid rotten. But that\u2019s about it. Unwanted advice or living vicariously through you or the kid is dead wrong at any given time. She shouldn\u2019t put her trauma of overly fantasizing about a baby girl and her name on you. She might suggest the name as one she thinks is gorgeous but that was about the span of it. Not the even rest of it. It\u2019s useless information anyway. It\u2019s secondary to its meaning. \n\nFor you. \nDo you like your MIL enough to appraise your kid with a name bound to her grandmother in that way. It will definitely create a bond between them. Is that what you wish for your kid. And what will happen if the kid does not live up to grandmas expectations or gets crushed by the anxiety to not displease grandma. \n\nThis is not just about the name. It bigger than the mame",

Alternatively, just tell her \"I'd go with a different name.\" But either way, if she can't stop, you can always just ask your husband to talk to her about it.

            "I absolutely agree with others that your husband should have a role in this.  I don't agree with the harsh attitude others are taking, essentially telling the MIL to buzz off.  Maybe they did not read the part where you mentioned how you love your MIL and have a good relationship with her.   There is nothing wrong with, and everything to gain, by taking a gentle approach.  You and hubby should acknowledge MIL's preference but also explain to her that you and your husband have chosen a name that is special to you and him.  You may need to use a bit of puffery to explain why the name is important to you, but whatever.  If you can tolerate a middle name or second middle name with MIL's choice, that would be a nice option.    \n  \nMIL may be disappointed with your decision, but I strongly suspect MIL will adore the baby regardless of her name.",
            "Mom and dad name the baby, not the grandparents.   Tell dad that it is his job to enforce this with his mother.   You have no responsibility to engage in MIL, and I suggest you don't.   \n\nOr just ignore it, and tell her the name after it is on the birth certificate.    DOn't engage, just smile and tell her why it is such a perfect name.   (Because mom and dad picked it).",

It doesn't matter that she wanted a daughter with the name because this isn't her daughter. She can't live the daughter mom life she wanted through you and she has to know you won't let her try. This is about your baby now too.\n\nYou don't have to be mean, but you do need to set a boundary here for sure. If you want to be super nice you could try to compromise and use it as one of your child's middle names, but if you don't like the name you don't in any way have to use it. \n\nTell her that you really appreciate all her support and the suggestion she's offered but you either already have something in mind, or straight that 'she just doesn't feel like a ____' If she feels betrayed because she didn't get to fully name another person's baby that's her own fault honestly - you can't let her manipulate you with her feelings.

Wake up at 6:00a.m. porn.\nRight before bed porn. \n\nEven a billboard was too mich and reminded him he needed porn. \n\nI really was like I don't think I can handle this anymore and get ignored, avoided, left alone...\n\nHe didn't want me to leave he saw it as an issue with himself but I had to tell him this is our problem not just your problem. \n\nWe went through hell and back and now he's a completely different man. He gets tuned on by me now, and we have pretty good sex regularly. He's even begun to enjoy the head I give which he couldn't barely feel it before. Now he grabs the blankets and his whole body shivers. \n\nIt's amazing to see all the changes in this man putting that shit down and not watching it anymore. People always talk about how normal it is blah blah it's not. It's so fucking bad for your brain man. \nDon't watch it anymore.\n\nWhoever girlfriend you have, or partner you have, if someone is inlove with you, it's going to just hurt them. You're also hurting yourself by not being able to fully enjoy sex. Not being able to fully enjoy anything. \nGuilty because you have to watch other people fuck eachother (or whatever it is you're hung up on please tell us)\nAnd you will get frustrated with yourself if you haven't already. \n\nPut down the porn. Don't watch it anymore at all. Don't even touch yourself for 3 months. \nYou will see a HUGE change.",

You can reset your kink level. But you have to stop looking at all porn. Not even non-nude pictures, if they are sexy. And no objectifying women you see in real life or in videos. Usually six months of that will be enough to reset you. And that pussy will feel so fucking good, you'll think about how strange it is that you couldn't cum before. And just so you know.

By the third, you're very much experiencing the benefits if no fap as well. You become a super human compared to the guys wanking it. It's awesome and exhilarating, you just have to decide that wanking is beneath you and refuse to settle for it. Exercise as well becomes preparation for the next anticipated sexual experience.

He is often very insistent that he still loves me even if the sex isn\u2019t great and he doesn\u2019t want me to feel embarrassed, but I\u2019m having a really hard time pleasing him in bed. Here are some things that he has been critical about: \n\n1. My facial expressions during sex are not flattering\u2014I have since been very mindful of my face and making sure I try to look attractive \n2. Not being vocal enough\u2014I have tried moaning more which didn\u2019t help because of point #3\u2026 \n3. I don\u2019t talk enough\u2014which I fixed by telling him how good he feels, which positions feel good, what spot to say in, when I feel like I\u2019m going to finish which didn\u2019t help because of point #4\u2026 \n4. I don\u2019t move enough. This one I really really struggle with. Like when I am in missionary I try kissing him (which he is not really into I have learned), try putting my legs around his shoulders, try pulling him in and moving him up and down against me where he usually pushes my hands off. When we are doggy style I literally just cannot force my body to move, some women may be able to relate but that position is just paralyzing to me but I am able to arch my back all the way! And when I am on top he doesn\u2019t like when I grind back and forth which is really the only way I finish, and doesn\u2019t like when I bounce up and down because he says it hurts. All in all he says I\u2019m not very \u201cgraceful\u201d. His ultimate criticism is that I am not \u201cworking with him enough\u201d and moving with him but I just can\u2019t figure out what that means because this brings me to point #5 \n5. I don\u2019t have rhythm he says. So when I try to rotate my hips against him or also move when we are in missionary or side lying he says that I am not moving right and ruining the flow. \n\nI truly am starting to feel bad and like everything I do is wrong in bed. He says that he loves me so much and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so ashamed but I really don\u2019t hear anything positive at all except for that I am attractive. There\u2019s been many criticisms from the beginning and I barely finish myself because I\u2019m so focused on making him happy. The only thing I know that I am good at is head which he doesn\u2019t let me do anymore because he wants sex to last longer. I\u2019m sure I do genuinely suck and want my partner to enjoy intimacy with me but it makes me feel genuinely inadequate. \n\nI genuinely wish there was like a tutorial or something, we were both virgins and I truly don\u2019t have experience. I feel like I\u2019ll never live up to his expectations and really need advice. I know some comments may say to not stay with him if he makes me feel this way but that is not an option for me right now. Sex tips are so appreciated, thank you! ",

            "Heres a sex tip:\nI recommend you both read \"she comes first\". You'll get lots of tips for yourself, and he'll learn that life isn't like a porn movie and if he wants great sex, criticizing what kind of facial expression you have. Like good lord. How's he some kind of expert with his one sexual partner who he can't even satisfy?!\n\nSeriously. If my partner said those kind of things, I'd never have sex with them again. I was lucky enough to have my first partner set a high bar - he always made me feel beautiful and sexy and thus, the sex was amazing. Rest of the relationship was a hot mess. But the SEX! \n\nThe thing is: it's not about the sex per se. It's about how your partner treats you in a vulnerable moment that's supposed to bring you closer. He criticizes you constantly, and none of those criticisms have anything to do with making it better with you. So, in this vulnerable moment, he's orgasming every time, and you're not because you're worried (understandably) about what expression is on your face. Like if it's that much of a problem, he could close his eyes and make you come like crazy. I'm not going to say leave him. But use this as important info about who he is as a person.",

Tell him straight up that if he continues this behavior the relationship will ultimately end. You will no longer accept criticism during sex and if he opens his mouth and a criticism falls out, you will hop right back out of bed and go do something nice for yourself. *Follow through on this.* Even if it means sex stops seconds in. Even if it means sex stops seconds before he cums. Even if it means he gets upset. *Stop allowing him to treat you like this.* \n\nInsist on seeing a sex therapist as a couple. Make sure you are in therapy yourself because you need to develop a sense of self that isn't built on his approval. \n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: \n\nTHIS IS NOT HOW SEX GOES IN A HEALTHY, LOVING RELATIONSHIP. \n\nGOOD LOVERS DO NOT BEHAVE THE WAY HE BEHAVES. \n\n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS.",

I bet if you told him he wasn't getting you off and doing it for you either then he would get defensive af quickly. I can tell you right now he doesn't know anymore than you and it boosts his ego to himself to make those comments to you. When my wife and I first started dating she was insecure and a little embarrassed to admit I was more experienced so when sex wasn't all that enthusiastic or switching positions I thought it was somehow because of me. Once I simply communicated and asked her she opened up to me and ever since then we have been on the same page. With some simple tips and pointers as we went along in the bedroom you develop a sense for each others strengths and weaknesses while learning. Now I can say hands down that my wife is the best I've ever been with and rocks my world and I still desire and look forward to each and every night with her.\n\nPoint being is that you're in a vulnerable spot because the only judgement you get is from someone who has the same experience as you (only each other) so that could very well just be his opinion and others would think you're much better than you thought or with more experience themselves help you with tips and be a fast learner. He's probably watched porn most of his life and doesn't even have the experience to realize that that's not how it is in real life 99% of the time. Don't let him put you down and make him realize he isn't satisfying or getting you off either. He needs to be knocked of of his little one count pedestal and grow up.

Like I am supposed to make fake sounds of pleasure? Why don't you make me make those sounds?\n3. I have had partners ask me this and I think is reasonable. Sometimes a little dirty talk gets people going. Memorizing a few phrases to say might be helpful here. Be mindful of how much he asks you to do this and how much you are talking. Dirty talk shouldn't be only on you.\u00a0\n4. I think this a fair ask too. No one wants a starfish. If you can't move in doggy style then I think you should stop doing it. If grinding is the only way to finish I homestly think he needs to allow you to do it until you finish or find another way for you to orgasm.\u00a0\n6. Try counting together out loud for this one. This way you both know at what second to move in or out.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I think your boyfriend has some reasonable asks and unreasonable demands. As others suggest he NEEDS to stop watching porn - the first 2 asks make me think he has porn brain.\u00a0\n\n\nI suggest that you have sex sessions that focus on YOU more often.

Ask him what his favorites are and learn from watching. \n\nTry turning music on with a beat that you can follow, when your mind gets lost again. \n\nTry it with the authentic thoughts that you have in mind like \"It feels so good, I can't even speak.\" and use the following 3 minutes to focus on yourself. With every right move, you can get time that he's satisfied and you can lean back for a short time. Don't learn special words. It won't have the same effect if it's not natural. \n\nMaybe try BDSM out: You are a passive character, so it would perfectly suit you to be bondaged - no moving needed, closed eyes.

If he doesn\u2019t show you or tell you how he likes it then he\u2019s being stupid by giving you non constructive criticism. Remember mostly everything in a relationship is communication. Neither of you could expect the other to know what you want in the bedroom unless you tell each other exactly what you want. Same goes for you too, during the deed you can word it to make it sexy and afterwards you can fan his ego a bit cause us guys are simple creatures. \n\nOther general tips, don\u2019t be afraid to initiate sex sometimes. A lot of girls who are new to sex find it a bit weird but there\u2019s nothing weird about it. You taking initiative makes him feel wanted and sexy and nothing feels better than knowing your own significant other is totally digging you. You can even make it a game and tease him through out the day by just randomly rubbing his arm or something of course.

            "I think that if he wants better sex, he should tell you what you are doing well instead of just telling you what he doesn't like. Good sex comes from confident people who communicate well with each other. It is a thing that two people do together and it isn't meant to be performative. It is meant to make both people happy, both people are meant to enjoy an experience together. The pressure to perform and the knowledge that he is full of nothing but critiques is killing your sex life. \n\nOn top of that, his directions are garbage. He wants you to move, but he hates when you move. He won't let you do stuff you're good at because he wants it to last longer, but when you don't do it, he's full of nothing but complaints. He sucks at telling you what he wants, to the point where I'm convinced that he doesn't know what he really wants. Have you talked with him about how you feel about all of this? Because if it were me in your shoes, I'd be feeling pretty unwilling to even try to have sex in the first place. If all he's going to do is put you down, and you basically never finish or enjoy yourself that much, then what is even the point in sex at all? All I'm saying is that sex is a 2 way street, and he should be trying to make you happy too. Not whatever this is.",

            "All due respect, his expectations seem based on visual cues he is taking from elsewhere, probably pornography. This is evident by his desire for you to look, sound, and move in ways in which he is comfortable with. As a person with a visual fetish, early on in my relationships I struggled with divorcing what I see from what I experienced, and when I met my wife, who has some body dysmorphia, had to find a compromise between wanting to see and her not wanting to be seen. With that in mind, here are 3 bits of advice for your relationship:\n\n1. Determine what you want out of the physical relationship; if you are comfortable being this submissive and prioritizing his pleasure, then don\u2019t let anyone here tell you there is a problem. Don\u2019t forget that your pleasure should be equally important to your partner as well.\n\n2. Have your intimate times in the dark. Make the room as dark as possible, slow way down, and focus on learning more about what each other feels like, while taking visual stimulation out of the equation. \n\n3. Change the way in which you communicate about your intimacy by only speaking about it outside of the act. Set your boundaries around how he speaks about your \u201cperformance\u201d while you are being intimate. Talk often about what makes you feel good, and encourage him to only give positive feedback. Focus on showing him you care in other ways besides your body.\n\nAs far as tutorials and such, they do in fact exist, but I find the easiest way to learn to move in concert with your partner is through couples activity such as dance (ballroom, latin, 2-step, etc) or couples yoga or couples breathing meditation. Also consider taking a belly dance or twerking class to control your movements. These will not guarantee that you will move better during doggy style, but learning to isolate the hips and extra mobility/flexibility in the lower back may help. The freezing up, is possibly due to nerves and cervix position. Some women can only enjoy that position during certain parts of their cycle, just due to biology. Good luck.",
            "Does he try to make YOU happy in bed??? This isn\u2019t a one sided thing. It seems like you\u2019re going above & beyond to please him and he\u2019s not even trying..",
            "He has too many critiques.  That's a him problem, not a you problem. My guess is he has never had sex and only watched porn and that's what he thinks sex is. \n\nIt would be like driving a car for the first time but only watching monster truck rallies to prepare.\n\nOn a more serious note, how you are treated in private by your partner is far more indicative of how they actually feel about you than in any other setting. If this is how you are being treated by him, when nobody is looking at this early point in your relationship, then you really do need to consider if this is the path you want to take in life.",
            "im sorry, but if your fiance thinks you look \u201cunattractive\u201d while having sex, he doesnt deserve to be having sex with you. if you were just laying there blankly and making no noise and not moving yeah, i could see how that could be uncomfortable for a partner but you are clearly making an effort. he has SO many criticisms and all of them are superficial and prioritise his pleasure over yours. i feel the same about grinding back and forth while on top, and my boyfriend loves it even though he doesnt get as much pleasure out of it, because he loves making me feel good. he thinks i am beautiful, through weight fluctuations, through \u201cugly\u201d sex faces, and you deserve someone who thinks you are just as beautiful in day-old sweats as you are in expensive lingerie. please, this will not get any better- only worse. if he makes you feel less worthy than you are (and he absolutely does) please end it before you end up in a terrible situation.",

Also ask yourself if he's doing what's right for you, not in a petty way just to throw it back in his face, but since you both are each others' firsts, neither of you are gonna be good right off the bat, so don't be afraid to ask him to do anything differently, if anything it might help with some of the problems such as not making enough noise. Also because you're each other's firsts, it's gonna take time for you two to develop comfort and your own \"style\" when it comes to sex, even though it's been 2 years, it seems that they have not been very fruitful in that regard due to the anxiety and lack of cooperation. I would suggest mutual masturbation or watching each masturbate, in this way you learn what each other likes and there's less pressure in trying to please the other, it may seem daunting at first but it's honestly really hot. Plus he might learn to enjoy just pleasing you without him having to finish, personally making my partner cum is at least half the fun for me if not most of it. Lastly, penetrative intercourse doesn't have to be the only way you two get off on each other, it shouldn't be, yeah it feels amazing but other things feel amazing too and can be more fun, like 69ing or, what I mentioned earlier, mutual masturbation. There are so many ways to please each other, you just gotta allow more creativity and outside of the box thinking in the bedroom. I hope you find something of what I have said useful, have a nice night :)",

I\u2019ve literally never thought of facial expressions during sex & tbh, most men make very odd faces during any sex act. I will say being in a relationship with someone who is overly critical of you will create endless self doubt, a lack of self esteem/confidence, and insecurity issues.

She doesn\u2019t know I saw and has been asking why I\u2019m acting strange. \n\nI\u2019m probably going to divorce her, I saw their texts too. It looks like it\u2019s been happening for quite some time. Also, it really sucks because the dudes dick has me beat (no pun intended) by at least an inch and a half. \n\nKinda want to denoggin myself (not really but hey)",

            "I\u2019m sorry she did that and for how much you\u2019re hurting.\n\nAdvice: Get the evidence; send yourself screenshots without her knowing. Then maybe stay somewhere else for the night or a few days. Block her, make her worry. Talk to a friend. Cry. Hit a punching bag for awhile. Scream in the woods. \n\nThen get your ducks in a row and leave quietly and methodically. It\u2019s a lot more satisfying if you don\u2019t let her see you break, and it keeps you both out of trouble. Handle this coldly and she\u2019ll be more hurt by your indifference than if you scream and curse and show how hurt you are. Use the evidence to make sure she gets nothing in the divorce.",
            "Gather yourself and be the better person. She clearly has problems and lacks respect for anyone including you and herself. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated this way, that\u2019s the bottom line. Leave the thought of her in the trash and move on. You owe it to yourself to be happy with someone else.",

That's a killer to the ego man I understand that. Let her know you know. Find out who the dude is. Maybe he's cheating to and you can tell his girl. But I definitely couldn't stay personally",
