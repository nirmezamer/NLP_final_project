I think the high scoring nature of basketball makes each game a little bit better of a statistical indicator of true relative strength of the teams, rather than luck (not to say that luck isn\u2019t important, but just as a relative influence). Likewise, the turn-based nature of baseball (and the lack of a strict clock) I suspect has a similar effect. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that surprising that the NHL is the outlier.",

It really isnt. Like the subway ttc attacks. Canada is a very safe country. The idea that reduced sentencing increases crime is just not statistically true. Rehabilitation does work, we just wont spend the money to make it so.\n\nSafe supply doesnt work because we wont spend the money to help them get to step 2.

I'll bet you to start at any equal distant points between both locations and it'll take you almost twice as long to get down there than it is to Eglinton. And then there was an Eglington LRT station right at it doors at the current location, it would've made it even more easily accessible at Eglinton with the LRT. And it also wasn't fucked. The engineer's report stated that they just needed $13 million to fix the roof. The same roof that Ford is saying is crumbling. And the same report that he used as justification said that it doesn't need to be closed down.",

That is infinitely easier to access than its current location.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll have more space to work with in that location.\n\nIt\u2019s an upgrade.  The old building is that, old.  Hard to access, and not getting as much traffic as it could.\n\nThe move is an overall better location.\n\nYou\u2019re just pissed cause ford made the decision.

In the 60s, closer to 1967 when Arabs gained more strength than the Christians in Lebanon, they forced the Jews out. It simply stopped being safe for them. In the 70s when the Christian/Arab civil war was happening the Jewish quarter got damaged, and many feared their rights would be restricted so they left.\n\nIn the 1980s Hezbollah kidnapped some important Jews in Lebanon and murdered them, which scared the remaining Jews out.\n\nPlease don't try to imply the Muslim rule was kind to Jews, because they treated them like Dhimmis. Second class citizens. \n\nAgain, just to be clear, you still aren't calling out Hezbollah for starting this conflict, or recognizing they have the power to stop any future conflict with Israel by simply not firing rockets and displacing 100K civilians.
