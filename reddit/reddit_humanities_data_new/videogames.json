A game in the 80s topped a game in unique enemies than a game made in 2017.

Wrong. \nI will say I liked the cooking mechanic but that's all I can say positive about breath of the wild as it seemed to wanna be popular so badly they abandoned the zelda formula and took notes from assasons creed and horizon rather than try to come up with something unique they made a overworld with repeating enemies and structures that are replicated hundreds of times and I can guarantee that if this wasn't a zelda themed game it would be seen as a mid game at best.

I don't mind the weapon breaking system because the game tends to reward you with plenty, but I can see where people's complaints come from. The story as a series of flashbacks works fine for what it is, but I was disappointed that we didn't get a lot of story beyond that.\n\nTotK took all of the BotW issues, fixed absolutely none of them, and added a few more besides. There are still an excessive number of identical shrines along with a bunch of identical sky islands. The temples are somewhat better in theming, but follow the BotW formula without even the gimmick of manipulating the Divine Beasts. The story seems better at first glance, but then you realize that they basically tried to pretend BotW didn't even happen and a lot of the region cutscenes are practically copy-pasted - not to mention that the story does NOT take into account any knowledge you have from the Dragon Memories (which DO NOT WORK like the BotW memories did because you can get majorly spoiled on the big twist a few memories in, unlike BotW's mostly unconnected series of memories focused around character building).",

Unlike the original Zelda, it's really just the company playing catch up with a long established genre, rather than defining a new one. Something that follows rather than leads.\n\nTotK: glorified DLC expansion which recycled the previous game and finally finished it with real content, but overshot it's platform so it runs terribly despite being a first party game. Substituted proper puzzle design with 'do whatever' gameplay. Again, it's trend chasing and borrows heavily from a post-Minecraft world full of building.\n\nI think the Miyazaki-esque vibe and sound styling is really overly self-reverent and the series has consequentially lost it's charm in an attempt to seem like a sweeping, dynastic epic. It's similar to the jazzification the Mario games have had over the years. Comes off like highly formulated, brand management rather than genuine expression.",

Sure, in BotW is was at least a new world to explore, but in TotK... I can't describe my frustrations with TotK tbh. The only thing I liked was Ganondorf, the thunder temple and the Weapon crafting. I can't help it - it just didn't feel like Zelda to me.\n\nSkyward Sword will probably always stay my favourite.

In both games, there are a few shrines that are just granting the blessing directly without any puzzle: while it works when there is an overworld puzzle first, sometimes there is just the blessing and that feels very anticlimactic.\n\nThe dungeons in Breath of the Wild are too similar with each other, even if I like the gimmick of being able to move the space. The dungeons in Tears of the Kingdom try to emancipate from that, but remain a bit too stuck into BotW's formula.\n\nWhile gameplay-wise I understand the fact that some Zonai pieces despawn after a while, it for me removed the interest almost entirely to build contraptions to explore the world.

The only things I liked about it were the things they got right from its predecessor, but missing Links tool just made me frustrated. After one play through I can say I don't see myself coming back anytime soon. Whereas I've already played botw over 5 times. \n\nI think they should have swapped ideas. Changed the world, and kept the old tool system. Straight up didn't like ToTK. It wasn't trash. But it gets like a generous 6/10. I personally think it's a 4, but that's coming from my bias favor for the previous game admittingly. If this was a stand alone game, 6/10 is more appropriate. \n\nThe one thing I'll give the game. Is it still has a lot of the same charm, and I loved the lore. But was too distracted most of the time with the actual gameplay and tedious exploration.

            "I think this sums both of them up nicely. I watched my wife play both of these games on my Switch and was consistently disappointed after she had explored a really deep and expansive area of the map for over an hour, only to be faced with a half-ass boss fight and then later rewarded with: 1) A sword that broke after using it on 3 enemies, 2) A shield that was no better than what she already had, or 3) A piece of armor whose set bonus was something goofy like \"1% increase in movement speed after turning around in circles 10 times in a row and then consuming 5 of the same food items back to back; lasts for 8 seconds.\"",
            "Breath of the Wild somehow managed to make opening treasure chests boring *in a Zelda game*. I can't possibly think of a more severe indictment than that.\n\nAlso, there's a certain tragedy in how Nintendo built this massive, beautiful world to explore, but then gave the player almost no compelling reason to actually explore it. Shrines get old after the first dozen or so, and there's no real dungeons to speak of, which leaves just the korok seeds scattered about -- and I don't know about you, but zigzagging across open landscapes in search of a currency whose sole function is *to mitigate a problem the new weapon system created* isn't exactly what I'd call a captivating gameplay loop.",

Forget the difficulty of that game for a moment, but every cave, tomb, or mildly interesting spot in the map you chose to work through was rewarded with something unique.\n\nEven games like Starfield only reward you with RNG item stats.

            "Even having loved both games this is such an accurate indictment and makes me wonder how much better they could've been without the dumb durability mechanic. Why no hookshot in a game where vertical movement is so important? Hover boots? Megaton hammer? Boomerang? Lens, masks. I mean they made the master sword suck! Still like chilling in the stable during storms though. Atmosphere carried the games.",
            "This is my favorite answer too but I\u2019d also like to expand on the games\u2019 inability to work in the classic dungeon design in an organic way with the open world. BotW and TotK have such lackluster dungeons it almost doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re reaching a climax at any point of the main quest. \n\nAnd once again, pointing to Elden Ring, there is a game that did this incredibly well. Whether it was the massive legacy dungeons, the winding underground dungeons, or the smaller castle dungeons scattered around the map, Elden Ring constantly kept the original design available within the open world so you could spend two or so hours exploring open areas and then just as easily spend two hours in a legacy dungeon with all the twists and turns and traps you\u2019d expect from a classic Souls game and ultimately culminate in a visually spectacular boss fight.",
            "Some elden ring players say otherwise.",
            "Only thing id say about this is that because elden ring has so many builds, so much stuff you get in dungeons feels like a waste of time. How many times you go into a dungeon and go \"ah this is a str item, and I'm using dex so it's useless\"",
            "Copy and pasted dungeons for some lame reward, Elden ring doesn\u2019t get a pass",
            "I disagree. Most items you get won't be usable with your build or are just flat out worse. The game is also designed so that its easier to stick to a single weapon (and upgrading it) so most gear rewards up just in the inventory never to be touched.\n\nAt least in botw/totk the rewards were always consistently of the same \"value\". They're also consistently the same and therefore predictable - meaning its easy choose what to skip and what to engage in. If you don't like collecting korok seeds, you can just stop at a certain point for example. Whereas in Elden Ring it's like a constant stream of disappointment entering the dungeons because you only go there for like the 1% chance it's actually something you'll use, otherwise it's just for the fun of doing combat (and souls I guess, but that isn't unique to the dungeons). I can see it being a fine system though for players who like changing playstyles throughout their playthroufh.\n\nThat being said, I still played through every catacomb and cave or whatever because the gameplay is just *fun* lol.",

The game felt really really good in the first 30 hours, those hours were really good but after that the game felt strange to me and I started to not like it anymore. Finished BOTW in 130 hours in 2 weeks (literally played the game all day) but TOTK really isn't it for me, the sense of loneliness, peace and exploration that BOTW gave me is unmatched in gaming for me",

            "I would've been okay if there was a durability mechanic that decreased the effectiveness of the weapon over time that you could repair. Having stuff constantly break was a bit tedious and caused me to rely more on spamming techniques than getting stoked about getting a new sword.",
            "They needed to last much longer AND be fixable with resources or rupees after they broke. No matter how strong it is, I'm never gonna care much about what is essentially a consumable item.

            "if tears of the kingdom and breath of the wild were pre apocalyptic the story could have been cool, like the reason majoras mask is one of if not the best Zelda is the fact that it's pre apocalyptic. you start off in a lively town full of NPCs and they all have tasks that they do, that's cool as hell. it makes the world feel alive. but in post apocalyptic games where the towns are essentially little encampments where the NPCs all just stand around in the same spot for the entirety of the game, that's so lazy and lame. it makes games feel dead and bland. \n\ni didn't know the switch could run the witcher 3, i don't know how big the witchers map is but maybe the reason those two zelda games had tiny shitty dead little encampments is that the zelda maps were just bigger? i don't know...",
            "zelda games all have essentially the same story but there's always a little twist and the stories are cute. if you played any of the older games you probably would like them they're charming, way more charming than totk and botw. they're literally the weakest zelda entries so if you liked those two you'll probably like the older ones.",

            "I\u2019m 100% convinced that if this game didn\u2019t have the name \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d attached to it, it would have been given average review scores and forgotten by most by now.",

            ">Why no hookshot in a game where vertical movement is so important? Hover boots? Megaton hammer? Boomerang? Lens, masks.\n\nI think it's pretty clear the dev team had a *total* commitment to the whole \"go anywhere in any order you please\" design ethos, and the idea of having areas that are inaccessible until the player finds the right tools runs counter to that philosophy. It's why all the player's major tools are unlocked at the very start of the game.\n\nOf course, the natural consequence of this was that BotW ended up having very little in the way of tangible character progression. It's one of the things I found most profoundly disappointing about it.",
            "Dart, bullseye. That feeling of following a path that takes you on a rewarding 1-2 hour new area of the map, curated dungeon, etc. is just \"missing\" in a lot of games these days.",
            "That\u2019s because the older souls like games were better in that aspect",
            "Sure, but every time I found something like that, I thought \"well, this isn't useful for me, but I can see where it could be useful for someone else. Maybe if I had a different build this would be a treasure.\" In BOTW, since every weapon is in practice a consumable, it's like every treasure chest has arrows or a healing item in it. Sure, it's useful, but it's never really satisfying to find and I'd rather just go to a village and buy them if I need them. There's no joy in finding a legendary awesome fire-elemental spear if it's just gonna do some damage and break in like five hits anyway.\n\nTOTK at least embraced that and focused on the weapon building thing, which was much better.",

            "I think what did it for me was barely even giving you much of an understanding of the world. Everything was new. You turn the corner, there's something else that you haven't explored. The shrines were phenomenal. Temples even more so. But ToTK took much of that and kind of half assed it all in favor of the zonai devices which were neat, but it seemed like the intent of them was to engineer crazy stuff. Okay, so what? Feel free to play the game however you want which is definitely a positive point, but it wasn't for me.",
            "Honestly, the lack of finding reliably stronger weapons is making Total feel like a slog since I not only need to find a base weapon to use, but now I need to attach something else to it.",

Something that felt more like the LoZ RPG an open world like that somewhat implies.\n\nInterestingly, games like these look great on the surface but lose their luster over time - took me a while to finish BotW and I still haven't finished TotK (hoping to on an international flight tomorrow).\n\nThe point is, some games punch high early and lose it a bit. Others like No Man's Sky and Starfield fall short initially but eventually get to the point that people are like \"oh, okay, here it is, this is what I wanted, I get it.\"\n\nThere's over promise under deliver, and then there's over promise and eventually deliver. Of course there's also unrealistic expectations taking shape against promises that were never made. I think these last two Zelda games fall into the latter - I just wanted something they weren't, but also never promised to be.",

I tho play it on CEMU, Wii U emulator and install the mod using BCML. Takes a bit to get it but it's really easy and comfortable, on PC obviously you can play the game at 60+fps, better resolution, unbreakable weapons and so on and so on"

Wish 343 understood that)\n\nJak and Daxter (not necessarily becoming good again but its been forever since we had new one)\n\nSly Cooper (same here)\n\nMegaman (X series)\n\nFallout (Bethesda needs to stop dropping the ball with the series)",

            "Personal for me and unlikely to get support but Dynasty Warriors. 9 was one of the worst games of all time and wasn't even enjoyable for fans of the series.

            "Agree with Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nTo elaborate just a little bit: in my mind, Game Freak still gets the creative elements (creature and character design, for instance) right far more often than they get them wrong. But they seem woefully unaware of how to meaningfully improve the core experience to keep up with the higher and higher standard that modern games are being held to. (or worse, they are uninterested in doing so) Other than Legends Arceus, I honestly don't feel like any of the Switch games have justified their $60 price tag. S/V in particular infuriate me, because a 2022 turn-based JRPG, made by the most profitable media franchise in the world, should *not* be having fucking performance issues and frame drops in a world where we have games like Xenoblade 3 and BotW / TotK running just fine on the same machine.",

It makes all RPG progression systems obsolete with all the EXP candy you can get so easily or its getting rid of decision making, like who gets a certain attack you find.\n\nThe region design sucks. There are basically no dungeons and optional routes and dungeons don't exist anymore in general. The original Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue have more optional content than Sword/Shield or X/Y.\n\nThe games were also always pretty easy, but the newer ones are just so easy that you can close your eyes, mash the A button and you would win 95% of all battles.\n\nModern Pok\u00e9mon caters more to the competitive/breeder/shiny hunting crowd, while leaving fans that want to play a RPG behind.\n\nAnd then they finally do something new with Scarlett/Violet, but it's a lazy game with a bare minimum open world, a technical mess and it also looks like shit.",
            "Somewhat unrelated, but one of my major disappointments with the third HTTYD films was that NOTHING was done with Hiccup's mom.  She has almost no screen time.  IIRC, we never see her interact with Stoik or get a sense of how they are reconnecting as a couple, and she barely spends any time with Hiccup.  Why go to the trouble to build the previous film around the reintroduction of this character and then give then NOTHING to do in the next film?\n\nIt made about as much as sense as sidelining all of Hiccup's dragon-riding friends.

Gameplay is fine but they have degraded with the side missions too. I can only remember 3 and 1 is from a returning character and the 2nd is an old grandpa giving life advice and the 3rd is a gay guy planning to propose to his bf in the academy. Even If the story couldn\u2019t live up to the bar SM1 set then it would still be good but it felt rushed. Could use more time in the oven and more co op moments between Spider-Men.",

            "I was gunna say this. 3 raised the bar perhaps too high. 4 was good but to me it felt I could predict it coming apart. 5 was a great game but a horrible metal gear game in my opinion",
            "I really enjoyed 4 and 5. The original trilogy is fantastic as well. And death stranding I really liked too. Guess I'm just a Kojima Stan. Dude makes great games. Fingers crossed Konami doesn't screw to delta.",
            "Yeah sorry but those games suck period. Its horror for babies and the gameplay is weak af.",
            "A lot of the series seems to be baiting Game Theory to make new videos for free advertising.",
            "Help Wanted 2 was the best in a while but it still lacks that energy of the first few games",
            "It looks like you don't understand anything about the story? The afton storyline ended in fnaf 6 bruh",
            "I would love the next one to be great. I'm not sure if I'm in the minority now as much as I was back when 3 released but I liked 3 a lot, just couldn't get into Andromeda. That said all I know about the next one was from that trailer that came out 3 soon to be 4 years ago so I'm not sure where that game is at by now",
            "I think they had everything there in andromeda, but they fucked it up. They should\u2019ve let it bake for an extra year or two but it\u2019s EA. What are you gonna do haha",
            "Mirage felt clunky and uncomfortable to play, like they tried to make some hybrid of the gameplay from Odyessy and 2. It really shows with the combat",
            " I maintain that Gears 3 is the best shooter of all time",
            "2 is definitely where it peaked. I enjoyed the others but they don\u2019t hit the same. I still play 1 on my switch every now and then.",
            "Praying we will see Frank, Chuck and Nick again! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d",
            "Very strange choice to make the fourth game a seasonal game, even weirder to make it more linear. I could play each of the first three for hundreds of hours, but the fourth I just played for about 6 hours and got bored.",
            "The original trilogy set the bar too high. Andromeda wasn\u2019t a bad game objectively. But it was a bad mass effect game",
            "the GBA games are fantastic",
            "Agreed. I didn't hate the first ps3 game but it wasn't on par with the GOAT SOTN",
            "Bruh, the GBA and DS games.",
            "As said the gameboy ones were good, and although very different the 2 on ps2 were pretty good imo\n\nBut yeah, a new sotn is way past due",

            "Loved every game except for 2. Such a slog. Hoping the next one is great!",

            "This. Haven't played a Madden since 08 and honestly never really been a huge fan, but objectively speaking the games since \\~2014 have been basically paperthin copy+paste and greed simulators.",
            "The NHL games have become a paid for roster update with marginal/forgettable gameplay changes and additions",
            "Didn\u2019t PoP get two reasonably good games in the last year or so?",
            "Far Cry Primal was my first of the series and, tbh, none other felt quite as good.",
            "Greed overpowers anything",
            "4 Xboxs, 4 big ass CRT TVs, 16 of us with pizza, soda, and chips, and 4 copies of Halo: Combat Evolved. What a phenomenal experience",
            "Or just remaster the original, and take my money, Capcom!",
            "I just disagree unfortunately. Fallout 4 had a level of blandness and lack of ambition I was shocked by for the franchise. I wanted that to be a one off but Starfield is easily the most hollow, uninteresting, stretched out Nothing experience I have had in a AAA RPG.\n\nI barely recognize Bethesda in their modern games. The bugs have never once been the issue for me.",
            "But they never fix the glitches",
            "There was like meaningless exploration. Ff7 remake got right what ff16 got wrong.",
            "Same.",
            "I feel like the sense of \"dumbing down\" comes from stretching the undead soul of Gamebryo around and keeping them from having features that modern engines have. I'd like for them to be able to present the more fantastical elements of the universe instead of janky animations and scripts struggling to stay on track.",
            "I think of origins as the last good one. RPG formal wasn\u2019t overly bloated and depressing yet, and it was a unique spin on the story. Sure the Isu stuff was different in a not-great way; but it was still fun. Odyssey was less fun, and Valhalla stopped being fun after about 10 hours.",
            "Honestly, I feel the same, but about Odyssey. Not including AC2 and Brotherhood.",
            "Eh I mean, it's literally always been like that, and it's only gotten more value over time, now you just buy the newest expansion and you get all the old content free.\n\nEach monthly sub comes with a battle pass now as well. Free mounts and cosmetic gear and weapons just for playing.\n\nI've played since Vanilla so to me it's like getting a free battle pass for the monthly sub I was already paying for.\n\nYou get more for your money now then you ever have is all I'm saying",
            "\u00c6nima is my favorite Tool album too",
            "At least they had their charm. New games feel soulless",
            "100% agree. The bugs in previous games never bothered me. FO4 I brushed off because I'm more of an Elder Scrolls fan anyway. But Starfield was a pretty big disappointment to me. I hope elder scrolls is a return to form.",
            "IMO the worst part of Starfield was how you could see how they once again took out Skyrim's out of their closet and stretched new skin over them without considering anything about the setting. Why do I have to scrounge for ammo in an advanced society where you can set up a self-sufficient automatic mining-industrial complex in 10 minutes? Why selling mass produced crap guns earns you exponentially more money than doing actual jobs for people? Why are the bases completely pointless since their only use - gathering material for upgrades - is unnecessary as you can buy all of them? \n\nThere are so many issues with that game but those three (and the lazy, randomly generated lanscape) show just how little thought went into designing it.",
            "Yea I can handle bugs.  What I can't handle is taking my beloved fallout, the franchise I loved for being such an in depth RPG, and turning it into an open world shooter with a heavy emphasis on building mechanics.  The dialogue, stats, leveling system all stripped away.  Nevermind the story and world, which would have made all my other complaints just minor is the story and world blew.me.away.",
            "I've got a modest Steam library, probably under 200 games. Starfield remains the only game I've ever refunded for just being awful. I paid for early access because I was excited and had refunded before the EA period was up and didn't miss it at all. I'll maybe pick it on some steep discount in a few years if I hear something great about mods or something, but I doubt it.",
            "As much as I disagree with this I respect your opinion and I hope you have a great day",
            "They fix a good amount of them",
            "I'm hoping they return to form by giving us the stat and leveling system of ES IV but the fighting/combat of V, being able to specialize your character more like IV did and dual wield like V and that'd be awesome!,.. plus bring in some of the weapons and armor from both III and V ... damn that'd be like a dream come true!,  crossbows from V and spears/pole arms from III.\n\nComn' Bethesda just combine what made your best 3 previous games so great into ES VI and you've got a winner!, don't take things out and water it down like you did with Skyrim.. that's what I disliked most about it... even though I did enjoy Skyrim, it just felt lacking after playing so much of Morrowind and Oblivion.",
            "Yeah, I don't regret playing it, the combat was decently fun, but I couldn't give any less of a shit about the story in Starfield and it sucked to be exploring a planet and recognize the same building you've already seen on ten other planets.",
            "I want cities to be the size of the cities in Oblivion. Although I really want them to be the size of Novigrad. And I want there to be lots of well written quests and worldbuilding. And I'd love to see some of the magical stuff that was written about previously that makes the world feel special. Where's the skywhales and the were-lions in Skyrim and Cyrodil, respectively? I hope we can actually see the potential of Bethesda to do their absolute best without hardware limitations since these consoles are supposedly much better to work with than the Xbox 360 generation.",
            "I don't regret playing it, but I do regret paying extra for 3 days early access, lmao.",
            "It's ridiculous that a company that's always advertised itself as having hand-crafted dungeons can't hand craft planets and puts out an endless number of plain surfaces instead of a limited number of planets with shit to actually fucking do"

            "Just downloaded 1,2 and 3 in a bundle. Haven\u2019t gotten to 2 yet. Is it really that bad?",
            "Hes too busy worrying about a game set in New York city having \"diversity\"",
            "It is dude. The first is a bit rough around the edges. But the second is plain bad. And for some cruel play of the universe, it's the longest of the original trilogy",
            "its definitely an issue with newer media. token characters who only exist to fulfil DEI are not great. look at the new little mermaid movie, they made the princesses all different races. they all have the same parents, it makes 0 sense. they try to explain it away with the seven seas nonsense. also PE2 isnt set in NYC, and the characters of both games are already written and there is no need to change any of them to fit modern times. taking snow white and making her latina for example, was not needed. or when you watch sandman and 9/10 of the couples in the show are lgbt, and they are the only couples having physical interactions to push the over representation in your face.",
            ">look at the new little mermaid movie\n\nShe was sea foam green in the book, white, then half white? So if anything making her white and not green in the 90s would fit what you are talking about? Just say you only want white people in media you consume",
            "she was white in the book. the issue is the desire to replace whites, not that we want whites in media. we want existing characters to stay the same. no one complains when will smith or denzel washington or any of the other amazing poc actors are in movies. people complain when existing characters get changed for social justice reasons. stop race baiting.",
            ">she was white in the book. the issue is the desire to replace whites,\n\nSo you are a racist complaining about a book you clearly haven't read cause a movie made a hundred years later has what you consider a \" undesirable\" in it... \n\nPeople don't complain only racist",
            "people complain about all sorts of changes to characters, not just race. look at spider man and how he makes his webs. a change from the comic got many complaints. its nothing to do with being racist, its to do with changing something people love. keep calling everyone a racist, while making everything about race, typical jsw with no brain.",
            "I don't know what you are talking about with spider man. They had different versions of Peter Parker in basically every run of the comic. Amazing, Spectacular, Superior are all different parkers. Marvel established the multiverse a long time ago\n\nYou are just talking out of your ass, to deflect from your racism"
