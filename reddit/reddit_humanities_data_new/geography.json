It should be situated somewhere around South Serbia, Kosovo or North Macedonia (in the area between Ka\u010danik, Skopje, Bujanovac, more or less). It is possible that the place has changed names since, or that there is a slight error in the transcription.

            "I'm not going to pretend that I know the military history of that region or the languages, the level of research you are doing is far beyond my reach and my level of knowledge. I apologize for the nonsense I proposed in my previous comment.\n\nThere's an interesting thing: you researched \"Radumir\" and you weren't satisfied.\n\nHave you considered the village of Radomir in Bulgaria? In 1918, it became the center of the Military Revolt (Vladai's Uprising or Soldiers' Uprising), an armed rebellion of disorganized formations of the Bulgarian army, which deserted after the defeat at the Dobro Pole. Pavlovi\u0107 seems to be clear that the village \"Ridumir\" was rebellious.\n\nRadomir in Bulgaria is 145 km east-northeast of Kacanik.\n\n\n\nWhy would Pavlovi\u0107 change the name of the village in his book? We can consider:\n\n1. typographical, transliteration, or definitional error in Pavlovi\u0107's book. Example in the same sentence, the same river: \"\u041b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0430\", also called in other sources as \"Lepenc\", others \"Lepenca\", still others \"Lepenac\" (in Skopje) or \"Lepenica\" (Kacanik), and still \"\u041b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0446\" ;\n\n2. cartographic error on Serbian military maps over another country (Bulgaria, at the time, an enemy);\n\n3. difference in accent between the Serbian and Bulgarian languages of the time when referring to the same place;\n\n4. avoid reader confusion by differentiating (and protecting) the name of his superior and friend, Duke Radomir Putnik, in addition to \"Radomir\" being a Serbian name that was not so uncommon at the time;\n\n5. Passing a derogatory tone on a place considered a \"den of mutineers with socialist tendencies\" (\"military insurrection\" was adopted in historiography during socialism, but after 1989, some historians define it as \"an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat, to change the constitutional order by force\"). This would be unacceptable for traditionalist military men like Pavlovi\u0107 who was director of the Belgrade Military Academy (1919) with hundreds of young officers under his responsibility.\n\n\n\nI believe you have already considered this possibility. If you ruled it out for any reason, please let me know, I'm curious. But I don't think I can help much more than that. I apologize for the previous nonsense and the new nonsense above. I hope you can find what you are looking for.",

            "longest bridge over water is about 24 miles, and this bridge would be 26 miles",
            "I'm in Victoria. Originally from Vancouver.\n\nGenerally speaking, there isn't much will to put a fixed link to the mainland from those that live on the island. People here prefer the separation and not to be connected to Vancouver as it would create even more of a likelihood that the island communities would become bedroom communities of Metro Vancouver.\n\nSo, even if there was serious consideration to being connected through the US, the likely consideration would be through the San Juan Islands. However, would the San Juan Islands WANT to be connected to the US mainland as well?\n\nWhile I have never been there, our own San Juan Islands, the Gulf Islands, do not want to have a fixed link, to either Vancouver Island or the mainland. When a bridge to the mainland has been discussed as cutting through those Gulf Islands, there actually is something called the Island Trust which part of their governance forbids a fixed link connection, even a fixed link between the islands themselves.\n\nSo, what's the purpose of a fixed link connection? Beyond tourism, mainly it would be commercial traffic and delivery. So would it make sense to create a connection to deliver goods from Canada, where you need to cross the border twice to deliver them to the island.\n\nWhile you indicate that the part of the island / mainland are rocky and away from the population centers, the northern part of the island would make the most feasible sense to do. This has also been studied. The area on the mainland called the Sunshine Coast as well has no fixed link, and that even though it's part of the mainland, you need to take a ferry there. There has been talk about making a fixed link from Squamish and over, following old logging roads, and that this possibly could as well be considered to do some island hopping to Vancouver Island as part 2.\n\nWhile it seems like a poor place to do this, with upgrades to the highways leading to this, would allow for truck traffic to come through Hwy 99 and bypass Vancouver itself from a route from the interior.\n\nSo, while it could be more feasible to consider going through the San Juan Islands, I've never ever seen this discussed and with my rationale and reasoning, I don't see why this would even make sense. The north island route, one that would bypass the Gulf Islands and any potential floating bridge across Georgia Strait to as well accommodate boat shipping traffic could happen, seems like the most plausible if there is a will and desire to do this.\n\nIt would make no sense to me even if feasible to connect us from Port Angeles. There is no interstate going anywhere near there and the Olympic Peninsula itself is remote as a result.",
            "As other commenters pointed out, the parties involved likely do not want a bridge. The ferry systems (this one and other WA ferries) have worked very well for me in the past. What we need is a couple new ferry boats.",
            "It would cost an astronomical amount. And the engineering would be difficult. It would be easily one of the longest bridges in the world. Its deep water, and earthquake zone and a really busy shipping lane. It simply will never happen. The other question is do people on Vancouver Island even want a fixed link to the States? I don't think many do. The ferry service to the BC mainland could be improved for a fraction of the cost.",
            "It's an answer to a question that no one is asking.",
            "in addition to other things people have pointed out, the Puget sound is also quite deep.

Iirc near Seattle the sound is like 400 feet deep",

            "A better connection would be from Campbell River, crossing over to Quadra Island, then Read Island, then Cortez Island, and then connecting to the mainland near Bliss Landing. This goes through Powell River, then connect across Nelson Island to the mainland again to the Sunshine Coast Highway. Then you either have a bridge over the Squamish River in Squamish, or a bridge somewhere across the Howe Sound. It keeps it disconnected from Vancouver by a good distance, but still has a road connection with no super long bridges. Seems the most feasible route to me, but it\u2019s probably something that really wouldn\u2019t happen.",

It also has more existing road infrastructure that can accommodate the traffic and would not be an international crossing.\n\nMore feasible than trying to island hop the San Juans, but still not feasible.",

Would be crazy expensive to build and probably made even more complicated by starting and ending in different countries. i work in transportation and it\u2019s already complicated getting consensus on projects due to all of the stakeholders. This doubles the number of stakeholders. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine how big the EIS would be on this. \n\nBasically this is so out of the realm of possibility that it will probably never happen, and i have even mentioned that there\u2019s not enough traffic to justify the cost, which would be in the billions, 5-10 probably.",
            "this sub is just about the best thing on the entire internet. every single day i learn something new or am reminded of something i once knew but forgot. regarding the post, i suspect that if an extension bridge were feasible, it would have been done earlier this century. (since 2000)",
            "I don't see what the point would be, the big cities in that area are Vancouver and Seattle, both of which are already connected so going over Victoria (a city of less than 100.000 inhabitants) with a bridge just seems like a huge detour and meaning the bridge will take far too long to earn back its massive price-tag.\n\nOther issues I could think of is that you appear to suggest a North-South bridge, which is about the worst way you can align a bridge because winds tend to be east/west in direction, so the whole thing is likely to shut down if the wind gets a bit brisk. \n\nAnd finally, shipping lanes, we've seen what a big cargo ship can do to a bridge if the accident happens, and here you will have to design the bridge to make space for them meaning its got to be tall, making the wind issue worse, or you have to put restrictions on what ships can visit Vancouver and Seattle, which I doubt either will be in favor of.",
            "I used to travel between Port Angeles and Victoria all the time. The ferry is awesome and doesn\u2019t take much time. To create a bridge / roadway between here would take considerably more traffic than the ferry pulls. And the ferry was not super busy. The 101 highway going up there from Shelton/Olympia is beautiful though",
            "I have sailed this area a few times as a passenger. I would not envy the people tasked with building this bridge. As it stands, there are already multiple ferry systems to get to Vancouver Island from WA. If it ain\u2019t broke\u2026",

As it is there is one small foot ferry only between Seattle and Victoria and it\u2019s hardly ever full. \n\nMost of the traffic from Vancouver island wants to get to Vancouver and not the USA.",
            "Port Angeles is the largest city on the Olympic Peninsula and is under 20k people.  It takes multiple hours to get there from Seattle.  Victoria is not on the BC mainland and isn't huge either.  And then there's everything else mentioned, most notably the weather, wave action, and potential tectonic movement.  This would be an extremely dumb idea.",

            "Both are bad ideas.",
            "There would be insufficient traffic to make what would be a profound engineering undertaking worthwhile. Highway 101 up the Olympic Peninsula is predominantly a 2 lane road, and much of it runs along the Hood Canal portion of Puget Sound. It\u2019s a long winding road that would require lots of work, in environmentally sensitive areas, and an Indian reservation, to achieve. Then after all that you would just be making it easier to get to Vancouver Island, which has the same issues with roads and environmental impacts. Add to that the vast majority of folks who live up there aren\u2019t interested in making things more accessible.",
            "Lots of good reasons here, but there\u2019s one more: the US Navy would NEVER allow this to get built. \n\nAll an invading force would have to do is destroy the bridge, then suddenly an entire US Navy carrier group at Bremerton and at least three nuclear subs at Bangor would be trapped in Puget Sound.",
            "Y'know the original plan was to have the CPR terminus in Victoria.  They drew up plans in the 1870s that the train line would carve down the coastal mountains and they would build a series of stone bridges across to the Campbell River Area.  Of course John A MacDonald was a drunk.",
            "I\u2019m from Victoria. Nobody here would want to have all that money to build an expensive bridge to the middle of nowhere. No offense to people from Port Angeles. Plus there are ferries that do just fine.",
            "I have been on the ferry across this straight on a windy day. The waves were intense. My wife spent most of the ride throwing up in the bathroom. I was pretty close to vomiting myself. I am not an engineer but I bet that makes building a bridge pretty difficult.",
            "that is 20 miles, over 200 foot deep water. That would be some serious engineering, and a full cities worth of material.",
            "why does this have so many upvotes? It makes no sense when you think about it for 10 seconds",
            "There is nearly sero reasons to build a bridge or tunnel from Victoria to Port Angeles. Only someone with no familiarity with the area would even suggest an idea like that.\n\nA bridge is never going to happen. Not only due to winds, tides, rains, but earthquakes. The area is overdue for a magnitude 9+ earthquake. Nothing in that area is designed to survive such an event and the fault line is maybe 100 miles west.\n\n100% of the trade to Victoria comes from the BC mainland. To utilize the crossing, a semi truck would have to cross the BC/WA border, drive around the Puget Sound or take a ferry across the Puget Sound. With border waits, driving, then finally taking the crossing to Victoria, you are looking at a 10-24 hour journey. It's faster to take the ferry at Tsawwassen to Victoria and not worry about any hassle at Customs.\n\nA rail tunnel like the one from England to France is the only way to make such a crossing to Vancouver Island work. But there is no real rail infrastructure in that area. A tunnel under the Straight of Juan de Fuca would need to go deeper than 400 feet. In some places the depth is 900 feet. It's the same issue with the Haro Straight and the Straight of Georgia, they are incredibly deep. Plus there is the earthquake issue.\n\nThere simply isn't an economic justification to build a crossing. Beyond that as other commenters mentioned, you don't move to Port Angeles or Vancouver Island because you want to be in the middle of a metropolis. You can find that nearby in Vancouver or Seattle.",

The one I just thought of is that this is major shipping lane for both countries. It\u2019s just got disaster and boondoggle written all over it",
            "Maybe you know this, but for everyone who doesn't and might be interested, way back in the 1870s when BC joined Canada on the condition that a transcontinental rail link would be built to the Pacific, there was a plan to build the railway across these islands, or other nearby Discovery Islands, to Vancouver Island, then south to Victoria. William Fraser Tolmie, one of the HBC \"fathers of Victoria\", even wrote a paper about the two main routes under consideration at the time, with the impressively long title *[Canadian Pacific Railway routes. The Bute Inlet and Esquimalt route no. 6, and the Fraser Valley and Burrard Inlet route no. 2, compared as to the advantages afforded by each to the dominion and the empire.](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/bcbooks/items/1.0222229)*\n\nI haven't read that paper, but my understanding is that the railway route was envisioned as going from the BC interior through the Homathko River canyon, then down Bute Inlet, an 80 km long fjord that is mostly cliffs into the sea. Then across bridges over several islands to Quadra Island, then a bridge over Seymour Narrows to Vancouver Island at Campbell River, then down to Victoria.\n\nIt was basically reviving \"Waddington's Road\", an 1864 attempt to build a road from the interior to Bute Inlet. But the Tsilhqot'in (Chilcotin) First Nation asserted their sovereignty and stopped construction, triggering the colonial government to wage the [Chilcotin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilcotin_War), which involved the deliberate use of smallpox as a terrorizing bioweapon against the Tsilhqot'in, and ultimately the hanging of a number of Tsilhqot'in chiefs who were only exonerated in 2014.\n\nObviously the powers that be chose to make the railway terminus on Burrard Inlet and what became Vancouver instead. Not only because the Bute Inlet route would have been stupid expensive, but because of the Chilcotin War and the resulting chaos and danger in The Chilcotin and along the Homathko.\n\nIn any case, a bridge from Cortes Island to the mainland at Bliss Landing, while possible, would certainly alter the feel of Desolation Sound quite a lot!",
            "A know someone who worked on the Victoria Clipper for years. Has a number of intense stories relating to bad weather. The Strait of Juan de Fuca can get large swells coming in from the open ocean. Like up to 30 foot swells. In the little aluminum Clipper people vomited all the time when there was weather, apparently. Sometimes the Clipper has to take shelter behind the aptly named Protection Island at Discovery Bay. Sometimes it did so only after taking a nose dive into a big swell, or getting wave smacked hard enough to break windows. Of course normally the weather isn't *that* bad and the Clipper can be quite enjoyable.\n\nThe Strait is much more ocean-like than Puget Sound or the Strait of Georgia. Ferries in Puget Sound are \"flat\" looking. Puget Sound can get choppy sometimes, but never has the kind of seriously dangerous seas that the Strait has. Puget Sound ferries could not handle the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where you need \"ocean worthy\" vessels. Plus it is frequently completely foggy over the water. Really thick fog that can last all day.\n\nIn other words, yea, The Strait can get some really serious and nasty weather.",
