            "how about some actual community engagement please",
            "So are we getting the new stuff on the 25th or is it just an announcement that we will get them later?",
            "NEXT WEEK!",
            "Given the sheer number of leavers in games now, there\u2019s a certain camaraderie with the one other player who was there for the whole game.\n\nI was in a long game in the Hourglass map where at points it was either me or the zealot alive, because something like an aoe knockback, or fire/gas/armies of gunners killed everyone but 1 person and 2 people immediately left.\n\nProbably 10 people came and went in that game, and the 2 people who extracted with us at the end had no idea what a nail biting adventure that entire game was.",
            "You know.\n\nI'd actually dig a social area in the game. Somewhere, where I can chill and look at people's cosmetics. Maybe play the odd mini-game or something like that.",
            "After testing the Rashad and Antax axes on Vet I've come to really apriciate Antax' cleave stat on a recent Maelstorm map with waves of mutants.",
            "I know I'm being optimistic here and a bit naive but\n\nWill the Dev Blog outline all the weapon types we'll be getting?\n\nWill a story outline/progression be mentioned. Like the story between Zola, the Twins and Rannick was really interesting but came to a close abruptly.\n\nWill it be accepting any community suggestions in the comments or somewhere similar?",
            "Can we get a dev blog? There's supposed to be one before the new patch, and it's less than a week left...",
            "Love that the mods are shutting down any negativity towards the piss-weak itemisation announcement of \"We had over a year to do this and still want another three months because we can't do our jobs in a reasonable timeframe\".",
            "Is it just me or are dreg/scab gunners just way too oppresive. I swear they're the cause of 80% of my deaths. The stun lock they cause is just simply unreasonable. Even running 3 gunner resist curios they just absolutely shred you, god forbid more than one of them is targeting you at a time.",
            "Don't give them any ideas",
            "I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s new stuff. I\u2019m relatively new to the game so I don\u2019t know what to expect.",
            "They have released several updates with only a 5+ day warning.  I imagine we'll get something Thursday this week, either in the form of laying out the impending update (slated for a 25th release) or delaying the impending update.",
            "I blame the title penance. They are not very thought out at all. Best thing in this game is when you bond with some chatty strangers over a chaotic session. Sadly those games are pretty rare \ud83e\udd72",
            "The Mourningstar has all those doors in the back. FS could easily open one up for an area where you could actually play some minigames and hang out with other players between missions. Like the bar we saw in one of the teaser trailers way back.",
            "are you using brutal momentum on your Rashad? That covers up the cleave weakness pretty much perfectly.",
            "The short answer is probably no.\n\nFS probably won't even come out with a dev blog before the actual update at this point.\n\nThey also haven't said anything about progressing the story, so I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.\n\nAnd FS listening to community suggestions? Very unlikely with how they blatantly ignore their player base to begin with.",
            "They always drop those pretty late best thing we can do is to\u00a0be patient and wait.",
            "Yesterday the reason for me going down multiple times was due to flamers and in one instances a mutant also grabbed me in the flames so I couldnt escape anywhere. Flamers and bombers can be a really nasty combo. otherwise the games went really well until these nasties were let roam without anyone paying attention.",
            "Long time Tide series fan here. I'd expect almost nothing and prepare to have your expectations unmet.",
            "hello, it me, thursday this week, nothing :(",
            "I don't think we can attribute it to titles anymore.  Anyone who wanted to cheese, got them already. \n\nPeople would leave before titles.  This isn't new behavior. This is just the darktide playerbase at this point.",
            "I do and I used to lean much more on the Rashad for having Finesse stat instead of the Cleave, the speed difference is noticeable. But the big turning point was against maniacs, particular Mutants. While both kill fast, Antax seemed to take them down in two light swings after using Infiltrate. And then wonder if the Cleave stat (2 targets) + Brutal Momentum is what made me kill three mutants in one light swing as they dropped down from a ledge during the mutie wave.",
            "It's like Darktide says\n\n\"Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment\"\n\nSeeing the absence of the dev blog and the singular emoji teaser, it's not looking great.",
            "This isn't even a cynical view, it's just plain true.\n\nHope is the first step to disappointment.",
            "Agreed. I'm actually a bit worried for the game. It could be really awesome, but the low player base, silence from FS, and even the premium shop having no effort put into it are all tell tail signs that the game is literally dying. Despite what the optimists and longtime Tide vets say. I do hope I'm wrong here though. Would be awesome to see it get the same attention Vermintide is getting.\n\nP.S. Just wanted to make this clear since it can be such a point of contention. I only mention the premium shop because from what I've seen, if a greedy dev stops caring about making money on their game, then they've pretty much given up on it altogether.",
            "I've only seen the tail end of Vermintide considering I picked it up 4 years after release. A lot of things people said weren't going to come somehow got released. \n\nGranted these are forums spanning two to three years back, so it can safely said this is their way of handling stuff. \n\nIt's just certain things that could be better and give even better replay ability.",
            "That's a good point as well. I'll probably just check out the update next week (if it doesn't get delayed) and take a break from the game till Christmas when FS has had some time to add another major update."

This game has been out for 2 years at this point and is different in like 4 ways at first glance from when it came out.  \nThere is no way there is a dedicated team for this game anymore, it has to be on back burner like \"you can work on darktide for overtime\" or something XD",

            "> we\u2019re also looking at expanding the feedback loop on this rework\n\nHonestly, this is hilarious line. So far the only tangible thing we got is \"there is itemization rework\". Nothing more, not a screenshot nor expected outcome or even how much RNG will be there. So far we might even assume it is imaginary item update and they gonna expand imaginary feedback loop, but hey, at least they have imaginary progress.\n\nFatshark, have the courtesy to release anything related to this rework and not a dry statement that you foreshadowed a month ago.",

I cannot fathom how, after spending nearly a decade making three iterations of the exact same game, they are still struggling this much to create a compelling loot system and end-game. \n\nNo one wants them to rush this but the question I have is did they not have any plan whatsoever for loot when they first set out to make this game?

They could have just copied the cosmetic, progression and equipment systems from Vermintide 2 and it would be a thousand times better than the gacha bullshit they saddled the game with. Pity that the gameplay is so good just to be ruined by literally everything else about the game.",

Great. \n\nWell, my expectations on what the update will bring are being raised, which is never a good thing. \n\nBefore it was slightly reworked UI, upgrading blessings and perks to higher tiers of themselves not counting for locks, a way to finangle the base stats of weapons a bit and a way to unlock new blessings more reliably, ie give diamantine to buy or gamble on new blessing, starting at lowest tier. If they\u2019re taking months to do this I\u2019m expecting something drastic like on the scale of the skill rework. \n\nNot a great place to be.",

Or slash the costs of this RNG weapon market and hadrons shit to 1/8 or 1/4 the cost, so at least I'm not dumping dozens of missions worth of resources to get one less than mediocre weapon.\n\nAnd the salt on the wound is \"We've been listening!\" from you guys, despite the fact that you clearly haven't. The community has asked and begged and pleaded for more communication on your part, but all we get is \"dev blog coming!\", \"dev blog coming!\", \"dev blog coming!\" month after month.\n\nI'm out, Fatshark. I ignored the doomsaying for a while, but it really is starting to look like Darktide is turning into another dud 40k game project.

A large portion of the DT player base want the power-fantasy that the 40K setting and it\u2019s weapons have to offer, and large swaths of enemies to exercise it on. If SM2 releases in a technically sound state this game is gonna be even more of a ghost town for months, if not longer.\n\nJust look at the Helldivers 2 release. If you want to argue that HD2 and DT \u201cdon\u2019t share a core audience\u201d go ahead, but it didn\u2019t stop the DT player base from dropping by half in the course of about a month. The penance update gave us a boost but two months later and we\u2019re already bottoming out again. A new map and a couple of new weapons without some kind of system overhaul underpinning it all will be lucky to sustain a boost for even that long. \n\nDarktide\u2019s combat is excellent but when the game runs like shit and is consistently in a content drought, it\u2019s 40K setting is what it survives on. With a new game coming on the scene offering even more of a power-fantasy in the same setting, it\u2019s naive to think a significant amount of players aren\u2019t gonna be flocking from DT to SM2 for some time.\n\nDozens is a hyperbole I\u2019ll admit, but it\u2019s very possible we\u2019ll be dipping into the territory of 1500-2000 players, if not worse.

Here's what Wargamer's interpretation of the interview question was: \n\n>Warhammer 40k: Darktide will have a character creator for players to customise their inquisitorial fighters, and its \u201cstoryline and missions will expand and develop after launch, almost as a live service\u201d, developer Fatshark told Edge Magazine\u2019s Alex Wiltshire in an interview published in Edge issue 372 this week.\n\nThat is exactly what I said, and neither of those \"game journalists\" ever claimed it would get live service updates, just that the story would be updated over time as compared to launching with pretty much the whole \"main story\" day 1 like Vermintide.\n\nI'm not expecting to change your mind, but at least anyone who finds this thread later can actually see what was said instead of making up villains. This isn't *actually* 40k, you don't have to see daemons in every shadow. Go play another game and relax instead of spending time being angry at this one, neither of us are here for long enough to waste our time arguing over update cadence. I've been enjoying Stardew Valley recently, haven't played since 2016 and loving the new changes.",

Be mad at GW for taking away the shirtless glitch. But don't be mad at how Darktide isn't Live Service when they never said it would be!",

This has been true for five years.  All other fluctuations in playercount have resulted in content drops or giveaways bringing people outside of that 50k back to the games or encouraging that subgroup to play more frequently in a shorter time frame.\n\nThe games offer a unique type of combat that is not available in any other video game.  Other horde games have similar elements, but do not come close to replicating the gameplay loop of Tide games.  That is why the floor has remained so firm over five years.  Helldivers 2 didn't crack it.  Space Marine 2 won't either.  \n\nSo long as these games exist and function, that 3k to 5k people will play it.",
            "I kinda think with regards to the SM2 talk, it'll be the same as it is for basically all of these horde games.  Play it when the rush to play it is there (new game, new season/content, whatever) and then put it at the back of the line and come back to it later while you move onto the next thing with new content\n\nJust like with DRG, HD2, and Darktide for me.\n\nAs great as SM2 looks overall, I kinda doubt the Operations will be as deep as people will need them to be in order to be highly replayable for a very long time.",

You can make a rough estimate from Steam reviews based on the fact that 1/25 to 1/50 people leave a review.\n\nWith this in mind, you're looking at roughly $55 million to $110 million when factoring in the Steam cut from simply selling the game. That's without even looking at the Microsoft store and Xbox versions of the game (and admittedly not factoring in discounts either). That's obviously a good chunk of money for running a studio of their size. Factor in cosmetic microtransactions, which typically make more money than the sale of the game itself, and Fatshark is by no means hurting for finances.",

The fact that I could get perfect versions of DLC weapons in minutes was one of the reasons why I have 10x less playtime in VT2 than in DT. Hell, I have half the playtime of VT1. The loot system there was,god awful, but getting new weapons was still more satysfying than in VT2. \n\nMind you, I'm not saying that any of our approaches in better. I'm just pointing out why people keep disagreeing about DT loot system.",

That doesn't mean it's infallible, but with how anticipated SM2 is, PR kinda gets a nat-20 baseline until they fuck it up. \n\nDarktide is a prime example of that happening though, with how anticipated it was after Vermintide, they really fucked up big time.",

I play the game to have fun, and having weapons that aren\u2019t gimped pieces of shit makes it easier to have fun.\n\nThing is, the number of people who actually enjoy rolling half a dozen dice and throwing tons of tediously grinded mats at literally every weapon type just to get one that\u2019s halfway capable of playing the game on max difficulty\u2026I think that number is vanishingly small.

After briefly looking at a couple of promotional screenshots, I can say with 100% certainty that Killer Bean: the Videogame\u2122 is absolutely gonna blow Darktide outta the water.

Every time someone tries to incite a panic over the next \"darktide killer\" I can only roll my eyes.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I do have some concerns about the longevity of the game. There are only so many times I can go through the same missions with the same modifiers, and I'm sure there are many people who are unsatisfied with the amount of content. VT2 had the same issue, and handily solved it with the Chaos Wastes mode. Darktide could absolutely use some kinda Chaos Wastes analogue, like a space hulk exploration mode.",

            "I think you're right, but for a different reason: the End Times scenario is slowly receding from the memory of even Warhammer Fantasy enthusiasts.  Placing a game in that setting now would be a very strange choice not for Fatshark, but for Games Workshop.",
            "Vermintide 2 has been cruising along with 3k players for years now. Also, cosmetics don't have to sustain Fatshark - the initial release gave them enough funds for a few years. They only need this money to last them until they develop a new game. This has been their business model for over a decade now. \n\nAlso, you're probably undervaluing how much money even a small playerbase brings in via microtransactions. When VT2 started releasing cosmetics, it brought in enough money for FS to stop releasing paid map DLCs and start supporting the game with new maps for free. And I'm pretty sure DT sells much, much more cosmetics. You hardly see anyone with premium skins in VT2. \n\nLike it or not, this is their business model, and it's been working just fine for many, many years now. Could they see a bigger sucess of they changed it? Maybe. But maybe it wouldn't, and they would go under. It's hard to blame them for acting cautious, when there are hundreds of jobs on the line, and the industry is full of studios that tried to create a massive hit and failed miserably.",
