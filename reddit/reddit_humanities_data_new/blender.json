        "content": "Congratulations to /u/thedarkendkb for winning last month's contest. You can see its results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ci4ngw/may_contest_flight/).\n\n## Theme\nThis month's contest will be hands. You may think about the dexterous and deft movements of an artisan, the use of sign language as an alternative means of communication, or the imprints that our ancestors left on cave walls. Think about what special meaning they may hold or what special purposes they may serve.\n\n## Making a Submission\nArtworks will be submitted as posts to the Blender subreddit that meet the following criteria:  \n\n* The post should be made before the start of June 30th UTC. \n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240630T00&p0=211&msg=Contest+Ends&font=sanserif&csz=1)  \n* The post's title should begin with `[June 2024 Contest]` to indicate participation \n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender  \n* The post should contain a top-level comment with the following content:  \n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:  \n\t* A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where the external assets were sourced from.  \n\t* A screenshot of the project open within Blender and showing the scene's wireframe. Additionally, there should be two more supporting images. These can be clay renders, viewport renders, or wireframe renders. For the sake of keeping things interesting, these are encouraged to show different angles.  \n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, exploring, or otherwise interacting with the scene  \n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists. For example, if you used Nuke for compositing, reused an asset you've previously made, or used assets made by others, then make sure you mention these things.  \n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.  \n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community.  \n* Entries that don't meet all the requirements or that do not adhere to the theme will be excluded from consideration.\n\n## Winning\nThis month, we're going to change the winning criteria. I will be attempting to assemble a panel of ~3 judges consisting of members of this community. Judges will be instructed to consider submissions based their artistic merits, displayed technical skill, interpretation of the prompt, and other such things. The exact method by which the judging will be done is still to be decided. If you'd like to be a judge, please message with me. I'd like the judges to be people who participate in this community, who have a firm technical and artistic skill set, and who, of course, use Blender.\n\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: June 2024` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also be able to select the theme for the next contest should they choose to do so.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post so that people can see all entries in one place, and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\n**The winner will be awarded an Amazon e-gift card worth $100 USD. You will need to provide an email and the country in which you intend to redeem the card to claim the prize.**\n",
