If plastic looks yellowed, it's because they didn't use the right kind and/or enough UV stabilizer.\nVery common problem with plastic parts from the 1970's to 1980's.\n\nOne good example are Panasonic radios/boom boxes. It's called Panasonic yellow. Seriously. They made some really beautiful, well performing radios back in the day. But the back panels of these always turn yellow.

You can patch it but it will most likely crack again in the exact same place. The proper way to install drywall is by using a whole piece and then cutting out the door opening. But it is only cosmetic and not an indication of a structural problem.",
