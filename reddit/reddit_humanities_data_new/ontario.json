        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nDue to current events, we have seen many posts about the Israel/Palestine conflict, typically about protests supporting one side of the conflict or the other, or articles about some statement made by a public figure.\n\nIn ALL those posts, the comments have devolved into insults, accusations of supporting terrorism/genocide and counter-accusations of [insert violent action here]. While each post starts with something related to our sub\u2019s subject matter, they always end up being screaming matches about something that is not even related to Ontario.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that the mods in the sub cannot, and will not, police who is \u2018right\u2019 in this debate. Additionally, when a large portion of the comments violate our rules (typically Rule 3: you must remain civil), we MUST intervene. However, since they ALL devolve into screaming matches, there\u2019s no point in even trying to maintain a discussion that doesn\u2019t even concern the sub\u2019s *raison d\u2019\u00eatre*.\n\nAs such, going forward, and for the foreseeable future, ANY post related to the conflict in Israel/Palestine will be locked even if Ontario related. If it IS related to Ontario, it will remain visible but commenting will not be permitted. \n\nThe mods would prefer not to do this, but the last few days have clearly shown that there is not realistic way to permit commenting on these posts while maintaining some form of decorum.\n\n***\n\nBonjour \u00e0 tous,\n\nEn raison des r\u00e9cents \u00e9v\u00e9nements, nous avons vu de nombreuses publication sur le conflit isra\u00e9lo-palestinien, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au sujet de manifestations soutenant l'une ou l'autre partie du conflit, ou des articles sur une d\u00e9claration faite par une personnalit\u00e9 publique.\n\nDans TOUTES ces publications, les commentaires se sont transform\u00e9s en insultes, en accusations de soutien au terrorisme/g\u00e9nocide et en contre-accusations de [ins\u00e9rer une action violente ici]. Bien que chaque message commence par quelque chose en rapport avec le sujet de notre communaut\u00e9, ils finissent toujours par devenir des querelles sur quelque chose qui n'est m\u00eame pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Ontario.\n\nIl est important de comprendre que les mod\u00e9rateurs de notre communaut\u00e9 ne peuvent pas d\u00e9terminer qui a \u00ab raison \u00bb dans ce d\u00e9bat. De plus, lorsqu'une grande partie des commentaires enfreignent nos r\u00e8gles (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la r\u00e8gle 3\u00a0: vous devez rester poli), nous DEVONS intervenir. Cependant, comme ils se transforment TOUS en comp\u00e9titions d\u2019insultes, \u00e7a ne sert \u00e0 rien de m\u00eame tenter de maintenir une discussion qui ne concerne m\u00eame pas la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la communaut\u00e9.\n\nAinsi, \u00e0 partir de maintenant et pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, TOUTE publication li\u00e9 au conflit en Isra\u00ebl/Palestine sera verrouill\u00e9, m\u00eame si elle est pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario. Si elle EST pertinent, la publication restera visible mais les commentaires ne seront pas autoris\u00e9s.\n\nLes mod\u00e9rateurs pr\u00e9f\u00e9reraient ne pas prendre cette mesure, mais les derniers jours ont clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas de moyen r\u00e9aliste de permettre les commentaires dans ces publications tout en conservant une certaine forme de d\u00e9corum.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nThe mod team had noticed a marked increase in racism and intolerance, in particular towards immigrants from India. Reddit has noticed as well and has begun removing such posts and/or comments.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that one side of the political spectrum has found their wedge issue and they are pushing it as hard as they can, stirring up hatred however they can and blaming immigrants for everything from jaywalking to the housing crisis despite the fact that many of the issues are worldwide. Facts and reality don\u2019t matter, only blaming \"brown people\" and those they perceive as being responsible for those \"terrible\" people being here.\n\nTherefore, we would like to remind all of our users that the [Reddit sitewide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) apply here and will be enforced. \n\n**You ALL AGREED to these rules when you created your account.**\n\nYour \u201copinion\u201d is irrelevant, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if you really, really believe it, you cannot push your unfounded racist positions here.\n\n**Again, for the people in the back, being able to use Reddit is conditional to respecting these rules.**\n\nIn particular:\n\n>**Rule 1**\n\n>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n\nThe important parts are:\n\n**users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned**\n\n[Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on:](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951)\n\n* their actual and perceived race\n* color \n* religion\n* national origin\n* ethnicity\n* **IMMIGRATION STATUS**\n* etc\n\nWhile the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination (E.G. \u201cI\u2019m just stating my opinion\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just stating  fact\u201d).\n\nAnother important portion is:\n\n**free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence**\n\nThat includes all of our users and the moderator team. Insults, derogatory comments and attacks will not be tolerated. If you post comments or message the moderators with insults and/or attacks, you WILL be banned on the spot.\n\n\nTherefore, going forward, we are going to clamp down hard on posts or comments attributing, without damn good evidence, the cause of any issue to immigrants or a subset thereof. That includes any reference to area with high immigration (e.g. Brampton) or any other form of dog whistles. It also includes attributing to an ethnic group of people the crimes or faults of an individual (e.g. the guy who proposed using food banks to save money). Message to the bigots: you\u2019re nowhere as subtle as you think you are.\n\nAnd before any complaints bring it up: [No, your right to free speech nor freedom of expression has not been violated](https://xkcd.com/1357/).\n\n***\n\nBonjour \u00e0 tous,\nL'\u00e9quipe des mod\u00e9rateurs a remarqu\u00e9 une augmentation marqu\u00e9e du racisme et de l\u2019intol\u00e9rance, en particulier envers les immigrants venant de l\u2019Inde. Les administrateurs de Reddit ont aussi remarqu\u00e9 et ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 supprimer les publications et les commentaires de ce genre.\n\nC\u2019est assez clair qu\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 du spectre politique a trouv\u00e9 son sujet pour diviser les gens et ils le poussent autant qu\u2019ils le peuvent en cr\u00e9ant de la division et la haine  autant que possible en bl\u00e2mant les immigrants pour tout et rien m\u00eame quand le probl\u00e8me attribu\u00e9 est mondial. Les faits et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sont sans importance, la seule chose qui compte c\u2019est de bl\u00e2mer les \u201cbruns\u201d et les personnes per\u00e7ues comment \u00e9tant responsable de la pr\u00e9sence de cer derniers\n\nDonc, nous voulons rappeler \u00e0 tous nos utilisateurs que les [r\u00e8gles \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du site Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) s'appliquent ici aussi et seront appliqu\u00e9es.\n\n**Vous avez TOUS ACCEPT\u00c9 ces r\u00e8gles lors de la cr\u00e9ation de votre compte.**\n\nVotre \u00ab\u00a0opinion\u00a0\u00bb est sans cons\u00e9quence et \u00e7a ne fait rien si vous y croyez tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s fort, vous ne pouvez pas pousser votre merde raciste ici.\n\n**Encore une fois, pour les personnes qui tardent \u00e0 comprendre, l\u2019utilisation de Reddit est conditionnelle aux respect de ces r\u00e8gles.**\n\nEn particulier:\n\n>**R\u00e8gle 1**\n\n>Souvenez-vous de l'humain.

Si vous insultez ou attaquez les mod\u00e9rateurs via des commentaires ou des messages priv\u00e9s, vous serez bannis sur le champ.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, nous allons r\u00e9primer durement les publications ou les commentaires attribuant, sans preuves solides, la cause d\u2019un probl\u00e8me aux immigrants ou \u00e0 un sous-ensemble de ceux-ci. Cela inclut toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une zone \u00e0 forte immigration (par exemple Brampton) ou toute autre forme sous-entendus racistes. Ceci inclus aussi attribuer \u00e0 un groupe ethnique les fautes d\u2019un individus (Ex. la personne sugg\u00e9rant l\u2019utilisation des banques alimentaires pour sauver de l\u2019argent). Message aux racistes: vous n\u2019\u00eates pas aussi subtil que vous le pensez.\n\nEt avant toute plainte, faites-le valoir : [Non, votre droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9](https://xkcd.com/1357/).",

The vast majority of the roof seems to be fine.\n\nThe report recommendeds that the high risk panels be replaced or reinforced before October 2024. The report also gives a budgetary estimate of 165k to reinforce the high risk panels - that's not much. Not sure why this justies immediately closing the center?",

When we started hearing about them moving the Science Centre to make space for a spa, I was pissed.  And someone on Reddit dropped that link, and I started donating.  Nothing absurd, $20 a month.\n\nI got a personal email from the woman in charge of donations.  And an offer to come down and see the new exhibit.  And I had a lovely conversation with her and then didn't actually go (it's sadly not that close, but I love the Science Centre and I'm okay with just donating for other people to keep going.)  And just last month, I got ANOTHER personal email, inviting me to the opening of their new film, with the line \"as one of our biggest contributers....\"  Had to decline again, but got told that next time I visit, I should drop by her office and say hi, and started trying to make plans to take my niece and nephew.\n\nIt looks like I'll probably never get to go see that new exhibit with them.  But again, I don't donate a lot.  I donate a tiny, consistent amount, just because I love the place.  And then I promptly forgot about it and just let it keep going.  And that makes me a big contributer?  I'm not rich.  I'm comfortable with my household income, enough to ignore another $20 subscription.  That's all.\n\nAnd you know... As upset as I am that they're moving...  I'm going to keep donating.  Because I really, really hope that the new building lets them be as incredible as my memories of them.

            "We went to the science centre all the time when my kids were small (like in excess of 10 times a year). We still do, just less frequently now that they're older and we're out of the city. It is absolutely a kid-focused attraction, but they do a really good job of making science concepts interesting and fun despite a lot of the exhibits showing their age.\n\nI could see if you don't have kids the science centre not being personally appealing to you, but I think we should support a wide variety of institutions even if they're not personally our thing. I'm not huge into ballet or visual art, but I'm glad the National Ballet and AGO exist.",
