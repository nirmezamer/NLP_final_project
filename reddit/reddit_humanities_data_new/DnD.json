But, it was the only thing that sounded fun at the time. Started mid campaign.) I am running great weapon fighting and using the polearm master feat with a glaive. I struggled a little bit in the encounters so I was just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on veng paladin? Specifically tactics.",
            "What actually is the disadvantage of playing an Artificer? [5e]\nI will play in a new campaign soon and chose an Artificer (lvl 3 or lvl 5) when I started building it, I noticed how overpowered it actually is, I don\u2019t see anything that is weak. I mean, I use a musket and I can just skip the reload property, my Arcane armor (infiltrator) is just amazing it can literally do anything, replace limbs, give advantage on stealth checks etc. my armor can also just negate the prone condition up to 6 times a day. \nSo is there anything bad with an artificer, or is it just completely overpowered?",

My DM has kind of let me have a lot of free reign on how I interpreted the use of this spell, but after hearing some other examples/listening to Critical Role, I'm worried that some of my uses of this cantrip were probably too powerful. Here are some examples of things I've done with it:\n\n- Create the illusion of the sound of people laughing 30 feet away\n\n- Create the illusion of the sound of glass breaking near someone\n\n- Creating a thunder-like rumbling around myself to muffle other sounds and make it hard for someone to hear me\n\n- Causing my voice to boom so loud that I was able to cause a stalagtite to break and fall from the roof of a cave and block off an enemy's path\n\nAny feedback on my perceived power level of this spell would be helpful! Are any of these okay uses or am I making this too strong?",

I am playing a changeling College of Creation Bard and thought this was a nice moment to multiclass into warlock (I love warlocks a little too much lol), since my ability scores are high enough to not take the level 8 improvement. I have been running from an army since escaping so I have mostly been trying to stay under the radar, but this character flaw will probably change that up a bit lol.\n\nWould love to hear some ideas!",
            "[5e] Starting a new campaign, and just rolled stats for characters. I thought it would be kinda fun if I went down the line of stats (str, dex, con, -> etc.) and rolled for each of them, instead of picking where to put my stats after I rolled them all. So\u2026 I ended up pretty good with 15/11/13/14/14/7. What would be a good class/subclass to go with? My idea rn is Eldritch Knight fighter, and going 16s in str and int, but I feel like there are probably better/more interesting options, maybe through multi-classing or something (I\u2019m up for anything honestly.) I\u2019m still fairly new to the game, so I was wondering if anyone had any ideas?",

            "[5e] So I have a question about the Gate spell and a cubic gate. We've had one for a while in the party and used it well but not like this. So it's mentioned that when you cast Gate, you can name a creature and yank it through the gate to the plane you're on unless it's god/planar ruler. \n\nThe cubic gate item allows you to cast Gate but only to 6 predetermined planes. What I'm wondering is, could I use a cubic gate to use the effect of pulling someone to the plane we're on even if that creature is not on one of those 6 predetermined planes.",

Any help would be appreciated.\n\n1. When making a check or ability roll that involves tools, when would you not have tool that you're proficient in?  I'm thinking about \\*Right Tool for the Job\\*, or having to choose a specific artisan tool set for \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (and in my character build, \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* as well).  Since you already have Thieves' Tools and Tinkerer's Tools (and Alchemist's Tools), why would there be a need for any others?  Don't those cover every need?  If I don't have proficency in Weaver's Tools, for example, can't I just use Tinkerer's Tools instead, and it'd do the same thing?\n2. I am a Mark of Making Human.  Do those bonuses stack with the artificer ones?  For example, could I use the Artificer's \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (+3), and the Mark of Making's \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* (+d4) to give myself a (+3 +d4) to an alchemy roll?\n\nThank you for your explanations.",

            "Paladins- especially Vengance Paladins- excel at heavy single target damage. Your Divine Smites do BIG damage- especially on a crit- and you don't need to decide to use one until after you hit, so there's no worry of whiffing one. And if you happen to crit, you can choose then and there to dump a big smite into it.\n\nYour Channel Divinities make you even better at this- Abjure Enemy lets you lock down an evasive foe and stop it from going after your other party members, while Vow of Enmity makes it easier for you to hit a foe with a high AC (or more likely to crit any foe.)\n\nYou don't have a lot of uses of your spell slots/smites and Channel Divinities, so don't go throwing them all at the first goblin that looks at you funny,  but make sure you are using them. If you don't, you might as well not have class features whatsoever.",
            "Artificers are sweet. Of course, they only have a half-caster's progression, and their martial stuff is going to lack things like fighting styles, smites, and other distinguishing benefits. \n\nCurrently, as my party's artillerist, I'm roughly the second best at everything: I'm a great blaster, but worse than the warlock. I'm a solid frontline presence, but squishier than the fighter. I can tackle most skill checks, but can get outshone by the rogue. I can toss out buffs and heals, but not as well as the bard. \n\nArtificers are extremely versatile and do many things well, but they're certainly not overpowered because they're virtually never the *best* at the thing they're doing. Skipping your reload with your musket is great, it avoids the Gunner or Crossbow Expert feat tax, but you're still not going to be as good from range as a fighter with the same weapon, even if it costs them a feat. Advantage on stealth checks is nice, but a rogue with expertise and 20 dexterity doesn't really care. Negating prone is good, but a strength-based warrior probably isn't getting knocked prone in the first place.",

The Armorer also has issues with its attacks not scaling as well as martials who will be getting increasing good magical weapons, absent homebrew.  They get plenty of goodies to compensate for that, they're not bad or anything (well except maybe the Alchemist) but they're not OP\n\nAlso, don't forget you can only infuse mundane (non-magical) items, and you can't stack multiple infusions on one item until you reach level 9.  If you want to infuse your armor with Armor of Magical Strength, that means you're not using the +1 infusion on it.",
            "Outside of the alchemist, they're not bad at all. Probably right in the middle of the power curve around the barbarian and warlock.\n\nBut they can be a bit tricky to play, and while stuff like a musket is strong early, it becomes untenable to scale both your dex and int to keep up using it, scaling your class features, and maintaining a decent con for hit points and concentration saves.\n\nThey're half casters, so they rely pretty heavily on their class features. This works out well for the ones with strong martial abilities like the armourer and battle smith, or the strong casting options of the artillerist. The alchemist is absolutely miserable, though.",
            "Your first two examples are fine, those are normal uses of the spell. For your third example, though, Thaumaturgy creates an instantaneous sound, not a continuous one. It'd be tough to drown much out with that- plus while they may not be able to hear the details of what you're doing, the thunder itself is going to draw attention.\n\nFor your fourth example, I could *maybe* see shouting three times as loud disturbing a stalactites that was already weak and on the verge of falling, but probably not one that's solidly attatched. And *definitely* not with any sort of precision. That's more of a job for Shatter.",

Sometimes we go several months without playing. I'd love to play more but we only want to play if everyone can show since we're a small group so we just have to be okay with that.\n\nMy other group meets once a month. We're a large group so as long as at least 3 people are able to show up we play. We share a summary of each session with the group so people who missed aren't completely left out and made up an in-game reason for their character to be missing (their fey patron teleported them away for fey reasons). We don't have a set day or time, just whatever day/time the most people are available.\n\nThere are also multiple groups that do drop in games where I live. I recommend you check local game shops or just google \"DnD [where you live]\" to see what might be available near you.",
            "I've got two shift workers and another player that \n has to be rushed to hospital at the drop of a hat. We play maybe once every 2-3 weeks. Having a set weekly time and day makes things easier, but it's not needed.\n\nWhat makes it better is that when we can't all play, one of my players has a backup campaign that we play instead.",
            "It is Possible, but tough. \n\nFirst, there is a thing called Western Marches, where DMs run one shots that are connected. The premise is \"Who shows up gets to play\". How you find a group doing this, IDK, especially locally. I'm sure there are groups doing it online...\n\nSecond is just to be up front about that with a GM. If they *understand* you are a sometimes player, then they can expect that, they don't plan for you to be there. Your character shows up on occasion and they work you in. Etc. I think that would be a harder sell, but some GMs would roll with that. \n\nFinally you could look for one shots online. StartPlayingGames is a site where you pay to play with pro DMs, and there's one shots on there all the time. You're just likely going to be playing with new people every time.",
            "An errata to the PHB has clarified that, when you level up, you always increase your hit point maximum by a minimum of 1.",
            "You'll probably only want about two levels in warlock, since you already have seven in bard. Pivoting fully into warlock here would be really weird, stagnating your spellcasting progression. \n\nIn terms of warlock subclass mechanics, Hexblade is always going to be tough to beat as far as frontloaded value is concerned. With one level in Hexblade, you'll get medium armor, shields, Hexblade's Curse, charisma-scaling weaponry, and access to the Shield spell. Other options could include Fathomless for a tentacle buddy (though this may clash with your Bardic Inspiration!), Archfey for the Fey Presence feature which may mesh well with your bardic skillset, or Genie if you value being able to nap inside a bottle. \n\nA second level of warlock gets you Agonizing Blast as what will likely be the main payout for this multiclass: Reliable offensive cantrip damage. Your other invocation can be something for RP or out-of-combat utility, or you could just grab Repelling Blast or Devil's Sight.",
            "So, the big standouts here are that you have a high strength/int/wis, low dexterity for AC purposes, and a 13 constitution. I'd want to put a racial +1 into constitution to hit that +2 modifier to better keep you alive, a fighter with only 13 constitution worries me. \n\nI'd be tempted to look towards heavily-armored cleric subclasses. A racial +2 in Wisdom puts you at a respectable 16, +1 into constitution puts that at a respectable 14, and your 15 strength ensures that you can effectively wear any heavy armor while not worrying about your low dexterity. You could make for a badass frontline cleric with this sort of build.\n\nIf you're more interested in Eldritch Knight, I wouldn't worry about enhancing the intelligence more than where it already is. EKs don't do a lot of offensive casting, they're more interested in defensive buffs, so you don't need a huge modifier in intelligence. 17 strength and 14 constitution will set you up nicely for front-line duty.",
            "Int really isn't that spectacular for EKs. Your spellcasting is always gonna be terrible purely by virtue of progressing slowly, and you know the same amount of spells at 20 int as you do on 8.\n\nYou *do* get Eldritch Strike to help offset this, but realistically the good spells you might pick up where this really comes into play basically starts and stops at Slow. And even when you pick it up at *10th* level you're still using 2nd level slots as your highest.\n\nEldritch Knight excels when using defensive spells to buff themselves long-term and help their fighting abilities. Stuff like Blur, Shield, Mirror Image and Absorb Elements are all standout spells from their repetoire. You also get the option to pick up some of those sweet Evocation AoEs, but by the level you get them, they're mainly just to spread damage on mooks, and the difference between a failed and successful save might not matter much.",
            "That's a big reason why a lot of tables don't enjoy the optional flanking rules as they're written. When advantage is easy to get, it significantly de-values any class/subclass feature or spell that enables advantage. \n\nUnless your table is willing to reconsider advantage on flanking, you're probably right that there's little reason to play as a Samurai. Unless you're alone in melee, you won't get any actual combat benefit from your subclass until level 15.",

Improvised weapons that are sufficiently close to real weapons can be used with the appropriate proficiency, but whether that means they actually count as a simple/martial weapon for the purpose of something like Orcish Fury is debatable, and I'd lean towards it not working by RAW. \n\nHaving said that, I think a lot of DMs would be fine with Orcish Fury working with any melee weapon attack. You're not going to break anything by applying it to an improvised or unarmed attack.",
            "This is going to vary depending on your class. \n\nFor clerics, druids, paladins, and artificers, you don't learn spells at all. You choose a number of spells equal to your casting modifier plus your class level (half your class level for paladins amd artificers) from your class's spell list to prepare, and can change which spells you have prepared at the end of a long rest. You have your entire class's spell list to choose from, and might even get bonus spells prepared for free depending on your subclass.\n\nFor Wizards, it's a bit more complicated. You have a spellbook, which at level 1 has 6 spells in it. You then prepare a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your Int modifier plus your class level. Every time you level up you can add 2 spells to your spellbook for free, but you can also add spells to it from scrolls, other wizards' spellbooks, or other sources your DM allows with an investment of time and materials.\n\nYou mentioned prepared spells, so I'm assuming you're not playing one of these classes, but for completions sake, Bards, Sorcerors, Warlocks, and Rangers have a certain number of spells they know based on level and can cast any of them at any time, as long as they have the slots for it.",

When you do so, choose a number of [Class] spells equal to your [SpellcastingAbility] modifier + your [class] level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor the Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, (Arcane Trickster Rogue & Eldritch Knight Fighter). You have the same spels every day. At relevant levels you add spells to your known spells according to the \"Spells known of 1st level and Higher\" section of the \"Spellcasting\" ability on your class. For instance Bard says\n\n> You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n\n>You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\n>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nWizard is unique, combining both of these known list and prepared spell facets into one with the spellbook. Each level you add two spells to the spell book and at the end os a long rest you pick a subset of those spells to prepare. You can also add spells to the spellbook by finding other spellbooks and spell scrolls.\n\n> You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n> You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n> Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.\n\n> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\nCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\n> \n\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.",

            "The issue is that Curse of Strahd is \"Dracula: The Game\", it's serious, very gothic horror, and if a gungan walks on screen it's going to break the tone. You wouldn't know that though because I assume you were showing up *to* Session Zero, where he should have explained that and clearly didn't. \n\nWhy didn't the GM mention that when he said no restrictions? I can't read his mind, but I'm going to make a guess. When the Plasmid came out, he heard about it, said \"That's stupid\" and never thought about it again. None of the people he regularly plays with would've went for it, so it didn't cross his mind when he thought about restrictions. I bet you he doesn't even own MPMM. I personally have never said \"No joke characters\" before, because until recently it never crossed my mind someone would play a sentient skateboard, which is a character concept I've seen discussed in this subreddit.\n\n(Side note: There are quite a few races that I just can't take seriously and wouldn't want in my game from a purely vibes/mental image sense, they're too jarring and cartoonish for me. But I don't opAnd I gotta say a plasmid is really close--it would work for some games, certainly with some reflavoring I can see it.)\n\nAs for \"potential racism\", I haven't read Curse of Strahd but \"distrust of outsiders\" is incredibly on-par for the vibe, and I expect human PCs still get a wary, skeptical eye the first time they roll into town. The locals are terrified human villagers beset by monsters and the weirder something looks the more it's going to increase that. No matter how you flavored it, a liquid character would have freaked the locals out. If you see that as fantasy racism and don't think it's okay, that's a thing you would need to go over at Session Zero to say whether you're oay with or not. \n\nThe long and short of it is there was poor communication on his part, and inflexibility with the kind of game he wanted to run. Were I him, I would have followed it up with \"but we're playing a gothic horror themed game, so come with character concepts that would fit\". A little while ago I wanted to do a short Thieves Guild campaign where everyone's criminals--keep that in mind, not every concept will fit an urban game where everyone wants to join a thieves guild. Because while Session Zero is about setting expectations, you want to avoid the exact situation you are describing. But also he was pretty inflexible, unwilling to find any options.",
            "Yeah, that checks. Imagine SpongeBob walking into game of thrones... Nothing wrong with lil' sponge dudes, they just don't fit the tone.\n\nEd but more specifically, I would caution you against associating real life racism with the common fantasy race tropes like \"elf hate dwarf\". Races in D&D are more like species with distinct biology and behavior than ethnicities that are only different because of culture and superficial appearance. Asians, NA and \"Black people\" or their equivalents, to the extent that those are meaningful categories that exists and makes sense to define, exist in most official settings as cultures, ethnicities and nations, but they're not a race distinct from \"white\" people; human is the race. \n\nas worldbuilding detail, it's common for new ones to exist and/or old ones to be extinct, altered, or to have never existed. For example, plasmoids just don't exist in my campaign setting. I don't think they're lame or anything; but I run a more Tolkienesque tone, and have established all these different conditions and facts about the setting over the decades. It's extremely common for DMs to \"ban races\" or even classes, and it has nothing at all to do with the players personal identities or anything squicky like that.",

This also sets them up to have people that depend on them for protection (if your campaign could support that kind of thing)\n\nRegardless having them poor money into a stronghold is a solid money sink while also feeling rewarding. Hell, later have the stronghold they\u2019ve been refurbishing and fortifying come under siege and have their personalized upgrades come in handy.",
            "Where are they keeping the money?\n\n3 300 pounds of gold isn't something you carry around in your pocket or lying about. \n\nWould be a shame if something... Happened to it \ud83d\ude01",

            "I don't understand why a few here are seeing this much wealth as a threat and saying 'have them be robbed' etc.\n\nThis money is a plot generator. It gives the players the means to invest in the world by owning land/ churches/ libraries/ whatever, all of which create story. It brings them to the attention of the (usually) broke upper classes and rich merchant guilds and others looking for money.\n\nYes, there should be the threat of being robbed, how they guard it will cause them to see the wider world as a place to be interacted with as well, and yes it could even happen if they make it so easy, but just having it happen to remove the gold (the reward they earned) from the game because the DM is scared of handling it is wrong. As a player if a DM did this just for that reason I would walk away.\n\nPlayers care about the game more when they have real stakes in the world. Let them invest in it.",
            "Some of my favorite gold sinks:\n\n- let them invest in real estate. Sure, it's a naval campaign, but wouldn't it be nice to own a tavern in your favorite harbor? A general store with a hidden tunnel so that you can smuggle marchandise or people away from the view of the tax collectors? A brothel on the docks to get all the juicy rumors floating around? I'd recommend the following supplement, it's very simple to use and brings cool benefits for several types of buildings: https://www.dmsguild.com/m/product/207377\n\n- shower the party's wizard with random spell scrolls, and let them burn money trying to learn them all\n\n- hire bards to sing their exploits. Wouldn't it be cool to be welcomed as heroes everywhere you go because your reputation preceeds you? To get rich people fighting to get your services because you're so good at what you do? Bonus points of you use this strategy to \"steal\" other people's achievements.\n\n- hire teachers to teach them stuff during downtime. New proficiencies, cool feats such as the ones to cook or heal people better with bandages, etc.\n\n- if it's  a naval campaign, a good amount of gold/treasure, etc. should regularly be offered as tribute to Umberlee. Or else...\n\n - make sure useful consumables are expensive and in limited supplies. They should buy potions and stuff like that any chance they get, even if it's prohibitively expensive...\n\n- hiring a crew and *keeping them happy* is by no means cheap, either.\n\n- bribes, etc.",

            "Do NOT listen to the comments telling you to just take it away unless you have a VERY good reason to do so.\n\nWhat I'd recommend is strongly suggesting that the party uses it to aquire a base of operations to stash their loot and maybe even make it where they need to start regularly paying for staff(maybe even explain how dangerous it is to carry that amount of gold with them). That way, they'll only be able to carry a certain amount of gold on them at a time without the possibility of losing it, and if they refuse your suggestions THEN have something like a dragon that's way too powerful for their current level steal it, because that way you can turn it into an interesting story thread with the promise that they can get it back at a later point when they're strong enough.",
            "Let them know that there's some noble title that they can 'buy' for, let's say 50k-100k, so they could become part of the city's aristocracy. You can make the offer more juicy by adding some lands (and including a bandit or a monsters area, etc.) In that scenario, you can introduce political plots, or simply let them realise that maybe they could afford the title, but not the living standard that it implies. Perhaps the bandits' boss is a pro thief and she escapes after stealing everything from them (investigation and persecution campaign?) Keep them busy, so they don't think in spending the money, and take advantage of it plot wise. It's a circumstance that is rarely played and can open some interesting doors.",
            "They can buy some merchant ships and get into the ship owning business, or buy warships and protect merchant ships from pirates and monsters or both.\n\n\nNot only they will get richer but also get themselves involved into local politics if that's their style. Otherwise you can give them plot hooks of sea monsters/pirate fleets to fight against or discover a distant land to explore.\n\n\nFor inspiration for a mercantile empire check out the city states of Italy during late medieval and the renaissance or Byzantium before the the battle of manzikert.",

They had a house built, 5,000 gp then split the rest and they ended up with descent magic armor and weapons for everyone. If I was smarter i could link the magic item price list here for you.",
            "In our last campaign my character had a noble background and came into a hefty inheritance around 2/3s of the way through the campaign. It didn\u2019t break anything, because the things that were available to purchase were not game breaking, and you still have a limited number of attunement slots. \n\nWe didn\u2019t feel the need to burn through the gold (tbh I don\u2019t know if it would have been possible), but it sped up a lot of shopping interactions late game to not have to worry about bargaining, or deliberating over what we could afford. \n\nIn areas where my character\u2019s family held power, our DM told us that technically we didn\u2019t have to worry about money, because everything was just being billed automatically to her estate.",

The players can create new characters. In gloomhaven, you get a bonus perk for every retired character you have. Maybe their new characters get a bonus feat or ASI.\u00a0\n\nYour retired character opens a shop. Or tower. Or tavern. Granting access to new items, or allies, or whatever.\u00a0\n\nThen you can have multiple characters in a campaign. You can feel \u201cyour\u201d power growing, while you fill your world with allies.\n\nProbably wouldn\u2019t REALLY work in a campaign without a ton of rules to balance it out.

That's a vaults worth of coin. No offense I would probably let my players get a quick one like this then have a band of npcs manhandle them and loot the spoils. Now I have an offshoot with return npc and the game is not thrown out of balance. And fyi the rich nobles wouldn't have or give that much coin. They would have given written guarantee or property.

Line up maybe 3 or 4 candidates... A great one, a good one, a bad one and a criminal/scammer.\n\n\nThen line up a few different investment options for the players.

        "content": "I'm a fairly new DM. I ran a \\~15 session from last October. I'm gearing up for 2 and 3. I have a player who wants to play a Warlock with a Genie patron (Tasha's Cauldron). We're starting level 3. He'd like to take the Eldritch Invocations \"Repelling Blast\" (Player's Handbook) and \"Grasp of Hadar\" (Xanathar's Guide to Everything), which allows him to push 10ft away in a straight line and pull 10ft in a straight line respectively.\n\nHe reasons that given his Genie patron, specifically Dao, he has \"Spike Growth\" so for a 20 sq ft area any creature moves through as difficult terrain and takes 2d4 damage per 5 feet. He claims he can cast Spike Growth and, on one Eldritch blast, he can use both \"Repelling Blast\" and \"Grasp of Hadar\" to move the enemy away 10 ft and then back 10 ft for a total of 20 ft. This means his eldritch blast (at level 3) does 1d10+8d4 damage.\n\nI ruled he cannot use both \"Repelling Blast\" and \"Grasp of Hadar\" on the same Eldritch blast. If he did, it would simply cancel out for 0 ft of movement. I'm imagining Eldritch Invocation is \"invoked\" at the time of casting Eldritch Blast, and the effects happen when the spell hits its target. To allow him to push and pull implies he hits and Eldritch Blast and that grants him the ability to shake around his target like a rag doll after the fact.\n\nTo back up my ruling, I put it this way. At level 5, he gets two eldritch blasts. So, mutliply all of that by two. The maximum potential damage at level 3 is 10 + (8 \\* 4) = 42. At level 5, it's 84. A Frost Giant is 138 health. This means, at level 5, his character could 2 shot a frost giant.\n\nAll in all, my philosophy is if my players put together a broken party, I can break the things I throw at them. I'm more concerned about party balance here, especially since he's pretty veteran and some of our party is fairly new. If I break enemies for his weird eldritch invocation and spike gimmick, it sucks for everyone else. If I do nothing about it, he clears enemies before the others have a chance to do anything interesting or fun. It's a lose-lose. I chalk this up to a weird interaction when combining core content (Player's Handbook) with extra content (Tasha's, Xanadar's). All that feelings stuff away, I think I came up with a sound ruling based on the materials I have - repel and push would happen immediately, cancelling out.\n\nSo there's the details I guess. I'll pose the question again. Am I just lame?",

            "So I will say first I love that you understand the role of a DM so well even as a fairly new DM, you are right that party balance is first and foremost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the ruling I like the way you have it as you have the justified reason for making the change, yes technically they would be able to do this but just as true is your ability to say screw the rules I am the DM (literally in the DMs role it says you can ignore any rule).\n\nI will say if you did let this happen it isn't a strict multiply by 2 because grasp is always once per turn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say keep the rule, tell them that it is just a niche overpowered scenario and tell them the base idea will still work at level 5 as the first shot pushes(or pulls) and the second shot does the opposite",
            "If you want to rule this like that then that\u2019s alright. RAW/RAI it\u2019s allowed but it\u2019s up to you. I would caution against using white room max rolls in order to calculate this because he can do 84 damage if he rolls perfectly after using 1 round of set up and one of his 2 spell slots. For Reference if a fighter rolled perfectly (without crits) they could deal 69 damage at this level. So that\u2019s 84 damage over 2 turns compared to 138. \n\nNeither of these numbers are what\u2019s actually going to happen in your game however. Which is why I don\u2019t think you should be evaluating just based on this math. Also him \u201ctwo turning\u201d a Frost giant wouldn\u2019t actually two turn the frost giant because he had to use one turn of set up. It would be 1 set up + 2 turns of perfect rolls.",
            "It\u2019s allowed RAW, though I get why you wouldn\u2019t allow it. But my philosophy has always been that if my player wants to spend two turns setting up a combo that MIGHT work, I\u2019m not going to tell them no.",
            "Per Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 77:\n\n> If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monster's turn, the person at the game table - whether player or DM - who controls that creature decides the order in which those things happen.\n\nSo, per that rule, this should be allowed to happen. However, it is stated to be an optional rule, so you are free to ignore it.\n\nThat said, once the player gets to level 5, one casting of Eldritch Blast produces multiple separate beams with separate attack rolls; one can hit and push, and then the second can hit and pull back, assuming they both hit.\n\nSome other points: First, it's definitely fully within the rules to apply one of those effects, leading to a 1d10+4d4 legitimate combo. Second, this whole thing takes two full turns to execute... One to cast spike growth, and the second to cast eldritch blast. This means the enemy has the opportunity to try to break the warlock's concentration on their turn, or simply leave the AOE of the spikes.\n\nOf course, it's possible that they might multiclass into sorcerer for Quickened Spell metamagic to do it in one turn, but at that point they've built their character to do one cool thing, why deny that? It still relies on actually hitting the target and costs sorcery points, which will be limited if they're multiclassing.\n\nOverall, I think you're overestimating the power of his combo, and should just let him have his fun once he hits level 5. After all, the vast majority of the time, he'll either miss one of the beams, or the enemy will leave the spikes before he can blast them, or he'll lose concentration from something, or he'll roll a middling or poor damage roll, or...\n\nIf you're really concerned about countering him, just put in some enemies who can Counterspell him, or Dispel Magic on the spike growth, or who are able to just fly away from the spikes on their turn... They won't take damage if they just fly straight up.",
            "I feel like you're vastly overestimating how broken the combo is. Having played it, it's not that powerful. Remember that you need a whole turn to drop the spike growth, after which the enemies can pretty easily just move outside, and spike growth is concentration so you're giving up on having another concentration spell up.\n\nI see your frost giant thing, but a level 5 fighter can also drop 80 damage in the first turn of combat with sharpshooter and action surge. Spike growth is really good, but if the rest of the party has coherent builds it shouldn't be that much of a balance issue.",
            "Eh.. it's not that strong and costs a lot.\n\nI don't think it cancels out; I'd say the enemy ends up in the same spot.  The Invocations say you can choose when to push and when to pull, so I'd rule at level 5 he could push an enemy 10ft through the spike growth and then if he hit again with the second beam he could pull it back through the same spike growth for another 10ft. \n\nI would be fine with this.  It requires a previous turn to cast Spike Growth (unless you somehow have Quickened Spell) and also costs two of the 3 Invocations you have at level 5.  If you're willing to invest that much, sure, I'd give it to you because you're sacrificing elsewhere for a very niche power spike.  The enemy you're doing this to could just run up to you or run away from the spike growth to deny you a direct line to knock it back again, plus Spike Growth also affects your party.  All for an extra 10ish damage per EB?  I mean, it's good, but I don't think it's broken any more than stacking EB, Agonizing Blast, Hex, Lifedrinker, and Hex blade's Curse.",
            "Raw they can do it\n\nThey also need to cast a spell as an action and not have their concentration broken and then hit all their attacks. I think it\u2019s a fine combo.\n\n\u201cBut they can theoretically two shot an ice giant\u201d\n\nOk, on the round the warlock casts the spell the ice giant throws two rocks at him cuz he doesn\u2019t wanna walk through the spikes. The warlock with only light armor prof is probably hit by both and must make two dc14 con saves if he\u2019s still up. \n\nGenerally monsters with like 6-8+ int should focus anyone that casts a concentration spell because they\u2019re fucking powerful and dangerous.",
            "RAW, I'm pretty sure they can push and pull on the same blast\n\nBut it requires setup, and field manipulation, multiple turns, can miss, and a spell slot on a spell to get it working with spiked growth\n\nI'd let them do it",
            "Honestly, it's not game-breaking. Spike growth is great until the rest of the party, especially martials, gets annoyed because it's in the way.",

            "Nah, it's a good ruling. It's either push or pull, not both simultaneously.  At lvl 5, though, I believe he would be able to push with the first EB and then pull with second.",
            "You are free to rule this way, but you(and most people in this thread) are wrong. \u00a0Repelling blast and Grasp of Hadar would be simultaneous effects and the player would decide the order in which those effects happen. \u00a0Page 77 of Xanathar\u2019s.\u00a0",
            "I'm not super knowledgeable about the rules but I like to bring up my experience in situations like these because I thought it was fun for the whole group.\n\nI was in a campaign once where we got to roll our characters and my guy wound up super OP. I offered to reroll but the DM said it was fine. His workaround was once I quickly dispatched my first enemy the others would recognize I was dangerous and mob my character. He always had enough enemies that every other character had a fight and tough decisions and my character was fighting for his life. Plus our healers got to jump in a lot because my guy was getting dropped left and right. A ton of fun.\n\nMy point is you're the DM you can make an encounter as challenging as you want it to be and enemies aren't stupid. If a mob rolls up on 4 adventurers and one of them is throwing people around like a jedi a good chunk of the mob is going to focus on killing that guy.",
            "It's a reasonable house ruling, though RAW I think that he could technically do both. Edit: Though if you do decide to make this ruling, it's common courtesy to allow your player to change his build.\n\nWorth noting- while there's no limit on the number of times you can use Repelling Blast on a creature, Grasp of Hadar can only be activated once on your turn.",

There\u2019s a good chance of getting the combo off once on one enemy but if that enemy survives then it\u2019ll definitely stay away from the spikes. Any other enemies will also be keen to avoid being \u201ccheese grater-ed\u201d.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve misread slightly.

            "Okay, I'm getting downvoted anyway, so fuck it, I'll choose violence. Yes, OP, you are lame. \n\nYou've done an extreme disservice to your player by evaluating them using maximized damage values to determine how strong their build is. This is unfair and unreasonable. That's like nerfing the party paladin based on maximized smite values, or nerfing the rogue due to maximized sneak attack values. You've woefully misunderstood the actual mechanical potential of what your player is trying to do, and you've made it their problem. \n\nWhen everybody says this is a \"good ruling\", what they're saying is that you're allowed to do this, and your motives seem fine. That's great. But this ruling isn't based on the rules of the game, it is not necessary, and it punishes your player for demonstrating an even *slightly* outside-the-box concept for how they want their PC to play. Rather than having yet another Agonizing Blast+Hex one-note warlock blaster, your player opted for an atypical, unoptimized, flavorful build heavily based on their subclass theme, and it scared you so much that you took it away from them **before your campaign ever began**. \n\nAt a minimum, tell your player that you're concerned about what this represents, and reserve the right to adjust if the game breaks because of it. Then gain some of the DM experience that you're in pursuit of as a newer DM, observe the effect the interaction has in practice from an objective perspective, and *then,* if a problem arises, you can discuss options to fix it. Don't salt your food before you taste it. \n\nGood luck with your campaign. Try not to take on the burden of fixing the system when you've barely dipped your toe into the system. Daolocks built around Spike Growth have existed for years, if they broke the game then it would be a huge topic of discussion. It's not. They're fine.",

They do not literally happen simultaniously in the context of mechanics and thus would not neutralize one anathor.",
            "It's a perfectly reasonable ruling. My question is how everyone else at the table feels about it. The Warlock can wait: we know what he wants. But are others thinking you're nerfing the guy, or are they fine with it, or do they think this is exactly the sort of Warlock power that needs nerfing?\n\nIf everyone but the Warlock thinks it's cool or correct or better, go with that.\n\nIf everyone thinks you're nerfing the Warlock, let him have his toys.\n\nBalance is BS: nobody but you knows how many enemies there are, or how tough they are, or how they rolled on their saves. If the Warlock's power is so amazingly intense that the other PCs look lame, they're probably not playing combats very well: Warlock powers can be cool but they're not the most grossly unbalanced things around. If it's just that the Warlock takes out the first tough guy in the fight, then add a tough guy. Problem solved.",
            "The biggest pitfall for newer DM's is to change rules too quickly, thinking some stuff might be too strong or crazy.\n\nThe combo of itself works perfectly fine as your player described, takes 2 rounds of setting up with precious resources (1 of his 2 spell slots and concentration, usually a feat as well) to do an okay combo against slower or dumber creatures. Any creature that flies, floats or just walks out of the area negates his whole shtick.\n\nAlso be wary of adjusting game parts after a player just spent most of their character creation making something based around it. It quickly turns into a \"Player vs DM\" whack-a-mole that enjoyable for neither side. Every strong looking build on paper still has a weakness and often deceiving on how amazing it actually is in practice.\n\nSo for this instance, as a newer DM, of specifically nerfing an okay RAW/RAI combo that isn't gamebreaking where a player spend their creation & character resources on? That would sadly indeed be a lame DM verdict, but I'd see it more as a beginner lesson to first see things play out before getting preemptive.",
            "You should have a talk with the player about how optimized for damage they wanna play compared to the rest of the party. Explain that encounter balance can be dangerous if he outdamages the rest of the party by far. Suggest he might want to optimize for support, as to not overshadow his teammates, but rather enable them.\n\nWhat does the rest of the party think about it? You don't talk about this, but that is also important.\n\nI think you are overestimating the damage of the combo, especially as it relies on a lot of factors going well. Grasp can only proc once a turn, so at level 5, agonizing blast can do the same damage and is more reliable. As such, I think you made a bad ruling. You start calculating his potential max damage...based on a situation where he precast spike growth somehow? This is the most useless white room calculation, that is normally made by an overzealous optimizing player, not by a dm. This comes across maliciously to me, but maybe you just forgot the round of setup. And the concentration. And the opportunity cost...\n\nSeems to me like you are astonished by the damage spike growth can do, while this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYour calculation for level 5 is also so irrelevant and out of context because 3rd level spells like hypnotic pattern and fear can be waaay more impactful than the damage you calculated. \n\nI think you still miss perspective and should have at least a talk with that player. Have a test combat where you let the player do the thing and ask what the rest of the party thinks. Maybe they like the spike growth thematic and also start interacting with it. Most melee focused characters can grapple and drag.",
            "Your interpretation is correct. He cannot use the same bolt to push and pull. But he can use two bolts at level 5 to do so.\n\n\nAlso, spike growth is an action, so this has setup time.\u00a0",
            "A lot of people in this thread with good points in regards to balance, raw, simultaneity etc, but i would say the best thing to do here is to just try it out. Let them have the combo, and reserve your ruling until you have tried it in game. The combo takes concentration, is single target, and requires a setup turn, so in actual play it might not be as powerful as you imagine.",
            "Yes it's lame, and not raw. And it's not even that good. If he wanted to actually min max there are way more broken things.",
            "Oh also - when evaluating how powerful a given ability or combo is, avoid using max damage. The chance of rolling max damage on 8 dice at once is extremely small, and is equal to the chance of rolling min damage. You should always use the average damage when making general comparisons between attacks and other abilities.",
            "I honestly don't agree. Calculating how strong something is by placing it in the optimal scenario and calculating for max damage is a bit disingenuous if I'm honest. On average 1d10+8d4 is 25.5 damage. To do this the player has to 1. Spend a full turn setting up spike growth. 2. Maintain concentration. 3. Have an enemy not move away from the center of spike growth. 4. spend a second turn casting, and hitting, eldritch blast.\n\nTo put this into perspective, scorching ray (a second level spell) hits for 21 damage on average assuming you hit the spell attacks. They built their entire character around this, passed up better eldritch invocations like agonizing blast and picked a specific patron to get access to a spell. I'd say let them have this fairly strong (but not even nearly overpowered tbh) interaction. At most I would rule it that repelling blast and grasp of hadar would always activate in the same order that the player has to decide on.",
            "I would personally rule that it doesn't work because of invocation wording. It says that you can push/pull when it hits, not any time after during your turn. In other words, you can't do hit->whatever->push/pull, it must immediately follow contact. When they get two blasts I think it works just fine",
            "You're welcome to make this ruling. It's not necessarily RAW, and I hope you allow your player to refund/adjust their build choices in light of it, but if you feel that it's the healthy way for your game to be run, then you're in the clear to run it that way.\n\nHowever, for the record, I don't think it's nearly as strong as you're making it out to be. Spike Growth requires an action to cast, with one of two available spell slots, and with concentration. The warlock also needs to invest two Invocations in order to make this happen, which comes at substantial cost of something more straightforward like Agonizing Blast. It can also just plain not work, as between the initial casting of Spike Growth and the follow-up of Eldritch Blast, the target can move in such a way that the growth field isn't interacted with.\n\nMaximum damage potential isn't a great way to evaluate something, as it's inherently a corner case. The average damage of 20ft of displacement over Spike Growth is 8d4 = 20, or 25.5 damage including the Eldritch Blast. That's over the course of two turns, not exactly gamebreaking. At level 5, it's looking at 51 average damage over two turns, against one target. Strong, certainly. Worth nerfing? I don't think so.",
            "You are doing exactly what I would/will/think",
            "Yes.  That\u2019s a lame decision.",
            "100% agree with ruling that each blast can have 1 or the other. Your ruling is fair.",
            "Personally, I think it's a good ruling. Tell him to get the Quicken metamagic if he wants more pushing/pulling power.\n\nAlso, if anyone is being lame, it's people who use these types of cheese builds.",
            "I think you definitely made the right call. There's a section in the DM Guide that's says something to the point of \"if a clash of abilities breaks logic, you the DM can choose how it plays out\". +10ft and -10ft = 0ft. It's barely even a clash of abilities",
            ">I ruled he cannot use both \"Repelling Blast\" and \"Grasp of Hadar\" on the same Eldritch blast. If he did, it would simply cancel out for 0 ft of movement.\n\nWhy? Nothing else in the game works like that, \"canceling out\" isn't a thing. A Warlock's Invocations apply when they say they do; Repelling Blast and Grasp of Hadar both say that when you hit with Eldritch Blast you *can* do the thing, meaning the player gets to choose if the thing happens. There's no reason the player couldn't choose for both things to happen, which means they both *happen*--they don't cancel each other out. \n\n>The maximum potential damage at level 3 is 10 + (8 * 4) = 42. At level 5, it's 84. A Frost Giant is 138 health. This means, at level 5, his character could 2 shot a frost giant.\n\nSo what? \n\n1) taking these two specific Invocations means the player isn't taking *other* Invocations which could be more broadly useful; they're specializing \n\n2) Warlocks only have 2 spell slots at 5th level, so the player is using one to create a static effect that an enemy might not even be affected by \n\n3) Grasp of Hadar only triggers once per turn so your math is off. \n\n4) why not let your player shine for the one specific instance they've built their character for?\n\n>I'm more concerned about party balance here\n\nA Warlock cheese grater is hardly the most broken thing your players can come up with, even if they're newer.",
            "Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.  Allow the player to use one or the other, but not both at the same time.  Least not on the singular blast.  As you've already discussed with others, letting them use \"blast 1\" to push, and blast 2 to \"pull\" at level 5 seems more reasonable as something for the future, though you may want to remain careful about it.\n\n  \nFar as the ruling as it stands though, 100% just makes logical sense.",

            "I would also probably ask them if they are happy to make a character completely for that one gimmick. Are they interested in the dynamics with their genie patron? Any other invocation they are missing out on? Are they going to get bored of following the same lame 2 step strategy for every combat throughout every adventuring day? Because chances are they are going to feel any other strategy is not worth it for being unoptimal in comparison.",
            "I'd go with your ruling, he can pick one or the other. I'd flavor his trying to pick both as 'you push him and pull him at the same time, and end up creating a torque that just spins him around in place. He still takes some damage from the spikes, but only as much as if you'd used only one.'",
            "Spike Growth is poorly written and doesn't even account for creatures with the hover move type, which obviously wouldn't be affected by a ground-based hazard. I would base my ruling on that information. Secondly, while you can use multiple invocations on a single eldritch blast, their effects happen simultaneously. You can't chain effects to happen one after another. If you use both repel and grasp, they cancel each other out.",
            "I would say yes you are being lame. It's not that much damage for the resources spent and importantly requires concentration which can be broken. \n\nThe books as good as say \"this is how we want it to be used\". Let him use it and figure out how you as the DM deals with it. \n\nNerfs are lame they are not fun. Don't nerf your player buff the enemy, give more minions and use terrain differently. Have fun with it and let your players have fun.",
            "Just a reminder that grasp of hadar is only usable once per turn on one creature.",
            "I think they should be able to choose an invocation *once per blast*. So at level 3, they have to choose either pushing or pulling. At level 5, they can use one blast for pushing and one blast for pulling, but not both with the same blast. It's still powerful, but not letting them do that would indeed be lame. If it's overpowered, that's on RAW.  Both invocations explicitly say \"when you hit a creature, you can...\", so that effect is can is triggered once you hit the creature, not when you cast the spell itself, and is thus applicable to each blast. RAW doesn't enable any arguments in favour of having to choose one invocation per *casting of the spell*, only one per blast because as you said, using both on the same blast would result in 0 movement. If you want to disable them simply because you think their strategy taken from RAW is too powerful, that's indeed lame. You would've had to say that before they built their character around it.\n\nFurthermore, grasp of hadar explicitly states that its effect can only be used once per round, so you cannot chain it. You can push the enemy with the first blast, pull with the second blast, push with the third blast (at lvl 11), but you cannot pull a second time at lvl 17.\n\nIf I understand the math correctly, that's 1d10 + 4d4 per blast, which is still a lot of damage. But there's nothing in the rules that let's you prevent that without being lame. This tactic lets them deal an average of 15.5 damage per blast, up from the default 5.5, but it costs two invocations. With agonising blast and 20 cha, that's 20.5 average damage per blast for up to 3 blasts at lvl 11. Over 60 average damage for a cantrip is definitely a lot, but it's warlocks we're talking about, give them some love. They have very limited spellslots, are super squishy, and their damage cantrip still less damage than martials' physical attacks. If they want to give their cantrip a cool and creative buff that they have to use a spellslot for, then let them. Just don't let them overdo it, stick to RAW by giving them either push or pull per blast, and limiting pull to one per round as written. Still powerful, but not nearly as powerful as what they originally wanted.",

It's hard to picture a single beam pushing and pulling at the same time \n\nRemember a turn takes place over 6 seconds. I imagine maybe the eldritch blast connects with the creature as a long beam, pushing into it and forcing it back over a couple of seconds. As it does so, the magic collects at the point of impact in a mass of white light, tendrils of energy wrapping around the creature, until suddenly it implodes, flinging them back the way it came.",

That character that, in the group dynamics, has the role of taking down big monsters. Think of rufy and zoro in one piece, for example.\n\nThen, frame each of the other players with a different role. Give utility spells/magic items to another player, turn him into the skilled expert of the group.

The only reason we all had fun was because the veteran didn\u2019t use it to one shot everything, he was sort of collaborating with the DM, only shoving things off edges for either comedic effect or we were in bad shape and needed time (shoving enemies to unfavorable terrain/far away, rarely insta kill coz we didn\u2019t have a lot of chasms). I can\u2019t say your guy has the same intent, so kudos to you for looking out for the entire party.

Everyone else needs to adjust for this one trick pony to do their one trick.",

I would however let them use them on different hits in the same eldritch blast. So they can push with one and pull with the other. It\u2019s a lot of damage, but it requires the both 2 rounds to set up, and the enemy to be in a bad position to begin with so I think it\u2019s fair overall. It\u2019s a fun cheese grater build.",

Your front line can guard the perimeter and force enemies to stay in. Grapples, shoves, sentinel, crusher etc. And tour ranged members can kite the edges trying to keep the spikes between them and the enemies plus they can also use their abilities to trigger the spikes growth as well.\n4 Warlocks have pretty limited spell slots and this strategy can get boring and not every battle will be well suited to use this tactic. \n\nRemeber that DND isnt about perfect equity between classes or roles. There will always be the best damage dealer in a parry and that will be exemplified with strong, well thought out builds.

Speak with the player and make sure they arent using spike growth to disadvantage your melee members but i dont think you should be nerfing this.\n\nLastly, the advice you are getting from some comments that \"ballance should come first\" is laughably bad advice when it comes to player abilities. I would only consider balance as a primary concern when giving out items or boons.",

It also limits the movement of your melee friends.\n\nAlso, you control the movement of the enemy. Just move them at an angle that would make this combo either push them out of SG (less overall damage), or simply walk out entirely.\n\nAnd you can always Dispel or just hit the guy to break Concentration.\n\nIt's not an OP combo, just a smart situational one. No need to neuter it. It's allowed as per XGE.",

When the players realize their Tabaxi Rogue or Monk can grapple and enemy and pull them over 120 ft around in a circle each round and one shot them, that's when you have a problem.\n\n\nHonestly, nerf Spike Growth not the invocations. Make the movement have to be voluntary or give it a limit per turn, and your problem is solved.",
            "Movement damage triggers typically are subruled to imply \"Willing Movement.\" See \"Opportunity of Attack\" as a reaction. This would be my ruling for this, is that because the creature is being forcibly moved through the area, they wouldn't take the damage.",

For spike growth to apply, the target creature would need to have taken the move action.~~\n\nThanks to TheEmeraldEnclave for clarifying. I still stand by the below though :P\n\nRepelling Blast\n> When you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.\n\nSpike Growth\n>  The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.\n\nTo be even more reductive, nowhere in the repelling blast description is the word \u201cmovement\u201d used. Therefore Spike Growth does not apply.\n\nEdit: However, it would apply with Grasp of Hadar because the word \u201cmovement\u201d is used \n\n> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can move that creature in a straight line 10 feet closer to yourself.",
            "Good ruling for balance, good ruling for the spirit of the game. Even if they use 2 Eldritch blasts with push on one and pull on the other, they both hit and cancel each other out. \n\nThe reason to have both would be versatility. Enemy behind Spike Growth? Pull them into it. In front of it, push them into it. \n\nIf he wants to do more tell him to get telekinetic and use mage hand to shove as a bonus action.

If they are both activated, they would occur at the exact moment of the hit, leading to the enemy being both pushed 10 feet and pulled 10 feet simultaneously. Meaning they do not move. I would say the same applies to multi-beam eldritch blast, so on level five they couldn't apply the push to one beam and pull to the other and have this movement occur, as they hit either simultaneously or close enough to each other that the net movement is zero. I see nothing that indicates that the caster can stagger or otherwise make the beams occur or move at different speeds.",
            "I'd def agree with your ruling. Given the short length of time rounds actually are (6 seconds), I'd be hard-pressed to think a caster could have one thing trigger on hit, and then moments later trigger another after the first thing was done, all while potentially moving and casting the spell. The repel and pull would definitely activate right on hit, so would cancel if both activated.",

If you allow one to work at the time they still get 1d10 + 4d4 rather than 1d10 + 8d4, which is still plenty and they should be happy with that.

If he's able to do things that are substantially more powerful than the rest of the party, combat will either be unfair or not very fun for everyone else. Keeping things balanced is going to be the right answer, even if it technically deviates from the literal wording of the abilities. \n\nWith that being said, I don't think it makes sense for Eldritch blast to be able to move someone forward and backward on a single activation from an in universe standpoint either. It's not a spell like telekinesis that exerts persistent force on the target, it just hits and it's over. If the blast pushes the target back, then it's no longer hitting them when they reach their endpoint, and there's nothing to pull them forward. I'm not sure if there's an official WotC ruling on using these simultaneously, but it really seems like they weren't meant to be used simultaneously. \n\nIdk if this is a player that cares about in universe explanations for how their abilities would work, but I genuinely can't think of a logical reason for it to function the way the player wants it to.",

            "You clearly made the right call. I think your explanation is perfect - if you have a push action and a pull action on the same eldritch blast, they'd clearly take effect at the same time and cancel out.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo Eldritch blasts are where he'd have a case. I can sort of see the logic of one pushing and the other pulling, but if you imagine it, that would mean they'd have to hit like\u00a01-2 seconds apart to allow time for the NPC to be pushed 10 ft and then dragged back. That doesn't feel like it's in keeping with the\u00a0eldritch blast, which says the spell's duration is instantaneous, so why would there be a delay between blast 1 and blast 2?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, aside from game balance issues, I think your rules lawyering is spot on - he can push or pull, but he has to pick one. Give him a chance to make a different choice in light of your ruling.",
            "If it helps, I think your reasoning that the invocation is selected at casting and activates when it hits makes *perfect* sense. There's nothing in any of the spell descriptions to imply that you could line up those effects to happen sequentially, and when two effects have the same duration and happen at the same time, you simply add up their effects according to the PHB, so they would either only be able to pick one, or the two would cancel out since 10 feet away plus 10 feet closer equals 0 feet.\n\nMaybe, if they really really want to use both at the same time, let it have the effect of \"acting\" like they passed through that space, maybe getting tripped up if there is an obstacle or something, but definitely don't allow that damage combo lol",
            "Firstly I want to preface this with I've played the same exact Dao Genie cheesegrater build as your player, at my table this interaction is allowed.For starters Repelling Blast applies to each hit of Eldritch blast so even without the 10ft pull from Grasp of Hadar you're not nerfing his damage that much. As a Dao Genie he could also take Crusher to be even more ridiculous.\n\nTo back this up even further Xanathar's guide to everything states \"In rare cases, effects can happen at the same time, especially at the start or end of a creature's turn. If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monster's turn, the person at the game table - whether player or DM - who controls that creature decides the order in which those things happen\". \nSo for example your player hits a monster with 2 Eldritch Blast Beams, they trigger Repelling Blast (RB) x2 and Grasp of Hadar (GH) x1.\nThey get to decide if they want to order these effects as: RB, RB, GH/ GH, RB, RB/ RB, GH, RB. As they see fit.\n\nRegardless as they hit level 6 they can fly and they will be able to fly over the spike growth themselves to always position themselves in the best spot to push the target through as much spikes as possible, you're not going to stop how powerful this build is (however it's only this strong against creatures that don't fly or hover)  so I'd just say let them play it how it's actually supposed to work, otherwise they will likely feel cheated after having built the character to achieve this goal specifically and will likely just bench the character to play something else.",
            "Eldritch blast beams are separate beams. Its part of the appeal of the spell. They can hit different stuff, for example.",
            "They're different beams, of course one can push and one can pull\n\nYou make a separate attack roll for each beam ffs",
            "It's magic missile that hits simultaneously. Eldritch blast doesn't specify.",
            "Clearly everyone is wrong here. They both pull and push at the same time so the target spins like a top. Clockwise or counterclockwise depends on which beam is pushing and pulling.",
            "That comment would not be correct, when you get multiple beams as you level, they are separate attacks they function and resolve independently of each other.\n\nBut even if you wanted to make an argument that they are the simultaneous then still by the clarification in Xanathars they resolve in order and in the order that the user(in this case the player) gets to choose the order. \n\nSo as an example, they attack a target 2 beams fire, both hits so he has two triggers according to both grasp and repelling. Since it all came from the player the player gets to decide the order and chooses to resolve blast 1 first, then hast the choice and applies repelling blast sending them back. Now blast one has resolved and we move on to blast 2 because it hit they can then choose to activate either repelling or grasp.\n\nSo yes it would 100% get better at level 5 as they get a second beam meaning they have a second chance to activate the invocation/ invocations and they happen at different intervals.",
            "That comment was mistaken. They don't hit at the same time anymore than a fighter with a bow and extra attacks arrows hit at the same time. After all, let's say you have a room full of rats with 1hp. It wouldnt make much sense if the warlock couldn't fire the first blast, and if it hit and killed the rat they still had to hit the now dead rat with the second blast. They can choose a different target for the second blast, so they're not simultaneous imo. Especially when there are spells that specifically state they hit simultaneously like magic missiles.",
            "They each trigger concentration checks which means they do not land at the same time.",
            "As others have pointed out, unlike magic missile, the Eldritch blasts are not simultaneous effects. Eldritch blast is specifically designed to allow the caster to select targets between shots, thereby creating a natural delay. As such, the caster would have ample time to apply one invocation or the other to each blast (which is its own separate attack).\n\nI think it\u2019s a really clever way of using his spells. If you\u2019re concerned about balance, it\u2019s going to require a little more work on your end\u2026 spread your enemies out so only one could get caught up in the spike growth at a time (his plan would do lots of damage, but he\u2019d only be able to do it to one creature). you specifically mentioned something like a frost giant, maybe add a rule that as the creature\u2019s size increases, the distance it can be pushed or pulled decreases. Maybe give the target a chance to save against being moved; I\u2019ve personally always thought that repelling blast and whatnot should have a strength save attached to them.",

For example there isn\u2019t an amount of time that passes between repelling blast taking effect and the victim being shunted 10ft. That is immediate. The same for Grasp of Hadar.

I've DMed for a Daolock before, and it was perfectly fine. They used the feature where they could, sometimes it was pretty good, and the martials had plenty of time to slap around the enemies who weren't caught.

Akin to shoving someone into a thorny rosebush.\n\nSecond, how exactly does the spell make them move backwards? I assume they take the hit and stagger 10 feet by, y'know, stumbling backwards, a.k.a. walking backwards... Stepping down on their feet... Or they fly backwards through the air and land down on the spikes... Or really, you have to go out of your way to think of an interpretation of how that spell moves people *without* causing the spikes to hurt them in any way.\n\nBut anyway, that's kind of irrelevant; the spell does not specify what it looks like or how the damage is dealt, all it does specify is that moving through the squares causes 2d4 damage per square, unwilling or not. Repelling Blast through Spike Growth just causes 1d10 + 4d4 damage, that's just how the rules of the game work.\n\nIt sounds like you're being a stickler for \"physics\" just to punish this player for this build that you personally don't like. You're attributing way too much malice to this player. AoE spell that procs on movement + Feature that causes movement = \"Obnoxious minmaxing git?\" No, I don't think so. It's a basic combo.\n\nI'll agree that having both the push and pull effects apply on the same beam is a little much, which is why I would advocate for only applying one push or pull effect per beam instead.

While ranged casters probably, and instinctually position themselves before casting, if a fighter can move and attack twice, and a ranger can shoot and move and shoot, it doesn't make sense to me for a warlock not to be able to do the same. \n\nA single turn for a PC is ~6 seconds, so if a fighter can move 30 ft, attack twice with maneuvers and a ranger can shoot, misty step, shoot again and then run 30 ft all in 6 seconds, I think a warlock can shoot two eldritch blasts at different intervals.

At high levels, it definitely won't be as impactful but, at that point, it won't be that effective against the monsters you are fighting. But the levels that it is useful in, it is a serious danger for some PCs.\n\nMost parties have one or two melee martials. Spike Growth is absolutely detrimental to them. It slows them down while taking damage.",
            "That\u2019s very good to know. Thanks",
            "For the second half there is no real RAW answer. At my table the blasts are generated when you cast the spell as the spell is instantaneous. They don't hit simultaneously, but you can't hold on to a beam and see what happens with the previous because it's already gone. The same with scorching ray. It just doesn't make sense to me to be able to hold on to a beam when the spell has no duration. For me it works essentially the same as BG3: choose target(s) > all beams fire off, hitting one after the other. \n\nThe PHB provides no rules for multi attack spells, but for movement Pg 190 explicitly says weapon attacks.  Since you can't move between the beam attacks, I don't see why you'd be able to wait to see the roll results.",

            "That\u2019s what concurrently means.  \nEdit: not saying that they do though.",
            "[deleted]",
            "That was not the conditional you had set out my friend,  \n\n\n>Clockwise or counterclockwise depends on which beam is pushing and pulling.\n\nWhich is false, the net direction does not care about which beam is pulling or pushing it cares about where the effects are placed about the pivot point.",
            "1d10 Newtons.  Fig, specifically.",
            "Only reason I remember this is looking it up for shield master and realising it also applies to hex after the fact",
            "The rule is about bonus actions not reactions",
            "Right?\ud83d\ude02 when discussing rules and rulings saying \"but rule 0...\" Is so utterly useless. Like yeah you can rule 0 every single rule in dnd to work the exact opposite as intended, how does this help?",
            "This DM has stated that he\u2019s not going to use RAW here and has ruled that the effects take place simultaneously. Your invocation of adventurers league is erroneous, but you knew that.",
            "WOTC published [Sage Advice](https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf) about it. Although Eldritch Blast is considered instantaneous, the ruling from Crawford and Co is that you do get to see the result before choosing the next target.",
            "That's true of any persistent AoE spell in the game. Web, grease, fog cloud, etc. Maybe your warlock player(s) should have aimed their spells better so as to not screw over the martials. I've never had that happen in my campaigns.",
            "But the effects are not happening simultaneously though, they get stacked and get resolved in order one by one \n\nAs explained in Xanathar's here:\n\n.\"In rare cases, effects can happen at the same time, especially at the start or end of a creature's turn. If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monster's turn, the person at the game table - whether player or DM - who controls that creature decides the order in which those things happen.\"\n\n\nIf Player hits Monster X with Eldritch Blast with two beams the effects triggered are Repelling Blast x2 (RB) and Grasp of Hadar (GH)\n\nThe player then decides in what order those effects resolve. For example: they can decide  RB, RB, GH/ GH, RB, RB/ RB, GH, RB. \n\nEldritch Blast is supposed to be over powered, it's literally a Warlock's bread and butter that makes up for their short spells known list and limited spell slots.",
            "Nothing in D&D happens concurrently, you'd create so goddamn many paradoxes you'd be unable to resolve a lot of combats\n\nSo being such a stubborn dumbass and read the rules",
            "Perhaps there should be a spin speed bonus based on armor? Plate armor would spin faster. Less friction, more aerodynamic. And repeated eldritch blasts could result in a faster and faster spin.",
            "A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake.",
            "Ahhhhh gotcha. Thanks sir!",
            "If the dm has already made their ruling and is set in stone then what is the plint of this thread? Validation? You think tou can make a substantial ruling in a game and post about it on reddit and not get criticized?",
            "Sure but those AoE spells aren't at the basis of a cheese build like cheese grating or devilsight/darkness, which is the context of the situation we are talking about. \n\nThose spells happen and people adjust. Those spells don't happen EVERY fight because they aren't the basis of your build. \n\nMaybe you do just have better players or maybe you are being a bit disingenuous about not understanding my point. Idk. Have a good one.",
            "Possibly though I would think there would be more friction on the plate as you would need a much lower coefficient on the bottom of the boots to overcome the big weight difference",
            "Actually misremembered that slightly, had to have a look cause something felt off\n\nThe rule in the phb is actually about allowing movement between attacks and is the only reason we can do that\n\nThere is no such rule for bonus actions\n\nThere is a sage advice stating you have to finish an action before you can do a bonus (this I fully remembered)"
