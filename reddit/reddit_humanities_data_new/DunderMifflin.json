For added realIsm, they actually did a controlled cervical fracture of Paul\u2019s C2, under the supervision of medical professionals flown in the oversee the procedure and recovery. They had to take over an entire hospital wing in San Jose, displacing 40 patients to other hospitals. The location set was also haunted, so they had to have a dozen catholic priests perform a series of exorcisms and set blessings, just to get through the shoot. But since Catholicism isn\u2019t real, they actually, in secret, hired an Aztec priest to perform a human sacrifice, which required a series of special permits and bribes. This last detail is the legal reason that the true cost of the scene was buried, and why the Jim/Pam proposal scene is conceded instead.",
            "One of my favorite tidbits is the director of this episode (her name is failing me) suggested it be filmed both with and without the dialogue sound. When she asked Greg Daniels (I think) which one he liked better, he said the one with sound. She asked why, he said \u201cbecause I can hear it.\u201d Lolllll I could be remembering it wrong, it\u2019s been a while since I listened to that episode of the office ladies podcast.",

Maybe the very back of the bottom shelf of the fridge. \n\nIf it was the car then they're both even more disgusting for that lol.\n\nEdit: this just unlocked a core memory. At a friend's house I'd always see his parents drinking iced milk, which already seemed gross, but one day I watched them make it. It was Irish cream, whiskey, ice, milk and a few splashes of lemon juice. By the time we were 10 we were their bartenders at their parties. I don't remember all the drinks they'd have us make but that was definitely one of them. So gross.",

I have to assume that just the right amount of lemon juice wouldn\u2019t change the flavor, but would cause some curdling to start resulting in a drink that had a texture kind of like an Orange Julius.",

So I had to [google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Games) it:\n\nFilming took place at a fake beach near Hansen Dam, as it was \"the bleakest lake [they could] find.\" The crew had to deal with hot temperatures during the day and \"frigid\" weather at night. One of Helms' scenes involved him being trapped on a lake in a sumo wrestling outfit, forcing him to wear a harness and be pulled by a boat manned by a crew member. For the fire walk, orange and yellow gels and lava rocks were used, and gas lines were installed to produce flames.",
