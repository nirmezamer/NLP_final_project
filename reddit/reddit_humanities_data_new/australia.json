            "Ironically, and I think this is why I get dragged into this so willingly I was pro nuclear from the mid 90s to the late 2000s seeing it as a safe source of power to replace fossil fuels with, even considering fukushima which was a 40 year old reactor and didn't have the same design of a 'modern' reactor. I think there was a lot of anti nuclear propoganda around which was emotional appeal rather than any sort of fact. Especially considering the amount of uranium Australia produces. Consider as well (granted I'm SA so it may have been a bigger thing there) when everyone united to not place a low level nuclear waste storage in the middle of nowhere in northern SA ignoring that what was going there was sitting in hospital basementes and warehouses.\n\nNow however as far as I'm concerned the ship has sailed for nuclear, I don't know how any level headed person could entertain the idea for Australia at this time. Well if they aren't getting kickbacks from fossil fuel advocates anyway. The nearest analogue on cost right now is the UAE who in 2008 announced a nuclear program, broke ground on the Barakah nuclear power plant in 2012 and comissioned the first of 4 reactors in 2020 (3 years after it was scheduled) with the 4th reactor coming online this year a cool 16 years after the project was announced. It had a headline cost of 25 billion USD so to build something similar here would cost north of 60 billion AUD easily. at 5600MW this wouldn't cover the current coal fired generation in QLD alone that is currently at 8000MW. 4 of the QLD coal generators having been build in the 2000s as well.\n\nNow I pick UAE and Barakah because it was their first nuclear plant and was build relatively recently so should be fairly indicitive of what it would cost to build in Australia and the timeline. So if we took this as 'announcement' and followed that timeline we'd be getting rougly 1/6th of Queenslands power generated by nuclear in roughly 2036 and over half of Queenslands power generated by 2040. Yeah great idea... This isn't even touching the 3,500MW available from gas plants, that's just goal. so taking that into account it'd take two equivalent plants, 8 reactors total to replace just QLDs coal/gas.\n\nlol sorry for writing an entire wall of text preaching to someone that believes the same thing I do it just frustrates me that this is even up for discussion or that a politician can push nuclear with a straight face right now.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve never fallen for any of the number of phone scams but today I almost did. I was called by a person with a British Aus accent claimed to be from my bank and who knew my full name and said that there had been some charges from Singapore. The phone number was a landline from Melbourne so I thought it seemed semi legit but I was still wary. He gave a number to call back on which had all the voice recordings of my actual bank and even the buttons to press to gain access to the crime branch. This was a big mistake as I should have just called my banks number. \n\nA guy with a sophisticated Aussie accent explained that there were a few steps I\u2019ll need to take to strengthen my account. They sent me a code on my bank\u2019s actual SMS. So i had previous legitimate messages from my bank on the same number. This is what blows my mind, they were able to access the banks sms. That\u2019s when I started to think this possibly could be legitimate but I was still asking lots of questions and not willingly divulging information. Basically they wanted me to take all my money and then send it to a new account they were setting up for me and they sent the new account details on the banks sms. \n\nI told them I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing this and I was a few minutes away from my bank so I\u2019ll just walk down. This is when he started getting really intense and desperate and saying the fraudsters were very close to moving my money out of my account. I asked them to send me a message though my banks app and they couldn\u2019t do it. I looked up the bsb and it was ANZ and I said, why would my new account be ANZ? It didn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI put them on hold and called the legit bank number and asked them to check if there were any cases of fraud in my account. I explained the phone call and they said it was a very sophisticated phishing scam where they have your details, can get into smses and are using AI to fake the Aussie accent. Although I\u2019m vigilant, I feel there were times where I thought it was a legitimate phone call. In hindsight there were so many red flags but you kind of overlook some of them. Even though I was very cautious, I could have been susceptible. So Just beware. ",

Go on. You've got my account details in front of you. I accept the offer. Just apply it.\"\n\nOh, no. I had to answer questions first.

I very deliberately avoided saying \"Yes\" during all the phone calls I received from these scammers. \"Is your name Algernon Asimov?\" \"That's correct. What's the next question?\" \"Sir, is that your name?\" \"It sounds right.\" \"Is that your name: yes or no.\" \"Just give me the next question.\" That frustrated the shit out of them. I don't know why they needed me saying \"yes\", but I am aware that real companies use voice recordings of their customers saying \"yes\" to agree to contracts, so I did not want a scammer having a recording of me saying \"yes\". Not at all.\n\nI also tried saying something like, \"I'm busy now. I'll call you back later when I'm free, on the customer service number.\" Oh no - I had to call back on the specific number they wanted to give me. \"But, if you want to give me a discount, I can just call customer service tomorrow, and they'll have the discount offer in their system... won't they?\" Nope.

Why would the bank knowingly let someone steal my money without intervention?\" Etc.\n\nHave you reported the scam to ANZ and Scamwatch.gov.au?

Other times it is someone who is complicit in the scam.\n\nI would never do anything to compromise your own safety/security, but if you have the opportunity to get the details of one of these mule accounts, it is good to pass them on the the relevant bank and/or authorities.
