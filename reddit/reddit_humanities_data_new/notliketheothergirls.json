(Not that being gay is a burn, and I don't think this kid would think of it that way, we have a variety of sexual curiosities going on as they hit puberty, but the way she turned it on him is the burn).",

This was in front of my female friend at that time who very much liked shopping for clothes, so I told him that there's nothing stupid about wanting to buy clothes, it's just as valid as a hobby as collecting figures (and I do both now!

I feel like an outsider because all my female friends started talking about boys, and I didn't get it, but I also didn't understand that I was, in fact, a lesbian. I really thought everyone was attracted to women and couldn't understand the attraction to men, so I sat there thinking, \"wtf are you talking about? That dude isn't cute or whatever.  But his older sister thought.. no, no, no bad. Bad. Don't think about other girls that way. She is just very pretty...umm what is going on???\" . Puberty was confusing.

I would think that either he got teached misogynistic views, which would be sad or that he was insulting her. Or yeah, maybe those girls weren't nice and nobody teached him that putting them down makes him just like them. Of course, his intentions could be completely innocent, but he is not 5. We usually learn that calling someone different is not nice. We mostly experience it first hand. None of these options are good. At worst, concerning in a kind of sad way. Autism is a reason, not an excuse. We are people who can make mistakes, grow, and learn from them. Most of us want to hold accountable just like any other human being. We are autistic not stupid. We can learn that our words have meaning and how we use them can hurt others, even if we don't want to. Autistic people are humans with the ability to learn,  feel empathy, listen to others, grow, and apologise if needed. Saying \"Oh, they are just autistic \" is dening our abilities.  If you were truly supporting autistic people, you would know that we don't like being treated like absolutely stupid toddlers.",

Sorry, this is long, but\u2026\n\nYou can and will get through this and will either look back someday and laugh, feel insanely accomplished, or at the very least, have the empathy, wisdom & experience to help someone else in your shoes.\n\nWhatever it is really sucks in the meantime and I\u2019m so very sorry you\u2019re going though it! While you\u2019re not alone, your individual situation and that way you\u2019re feeling/processing it is certainly unique, and I won\u2019t pretend to know exactly what it\u2019s like. All I know is, things are never as bad as we think or feel it is in our heads.\n\nWe are all soooo much stronger, smarter and durable than we know. You\u2019re gonna amaze you\u2019re self, I just know it. Because you have already amazed me and I don\u2019t even know you! As it takes everything to admit we need help or support, let alone ask for it!  Vulnerability really is an incredible strength! Never lose it!\n\nTips to help:\n\n1 Get out of our head! That awkward thing you said? No one cares- they\u2019re far more worried about the awkward thing that they said. So\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it! Get a massage, get laid, masturbate, take a walk, meditate, whatever we gotta do to not stress. Easier said than done, I know (Believe me, I know).\n\n2 Be productive. Feelings of productivity are directly linked to feelings of self worth. Accomplishment releases a hit of dopamine. It can be as small as making the bed (or even getting out of it! That shit is hard AF when we\u2019re going through it! If we can\u2019t do for ourselves, try to do for others (sometimes this is easiest). Try making a checklist- it feels so good to cross things off/put a \u2705next to it!\n\nfuck up 1 or 2, IT\u2019S OKAY! Just be easy on ourselves (& others) Don\u2019t punish ourself for not getting X done or doing too much of Y instead- it happens! Tomorrow is a new day- ruminating only makes us feel worse\n\n3 Follow through: Ever feel like shit for having this big to-do list and not getting a single one done? Just get one thing done to get the ball rolling, if we really can\u2019t snap out of it, get out of our heads or get things done, we need to give ourselves permission. Say, \u201cself, today we\u2019re just gonna lounge\u2705watch YT,\u2705scroll Reddit\u2705and cry\u201d.\u2705Just give yourself permission to sulk. Then,we actually did get the things we said we wanted accomplished and technically were productive. Need to to feel bad when we do what we said we\u2019re gonna do \ud83d\ude09And sometimes, that kind of day is exactly what\u2019s needed! (Don\u2019t those bright, green checks look GOOD?!\ud83d\ude0d\n\n4 CONNECT You\u2019re already doing this one by reaching out in the first place, which I think is awesome! So give yourself a \u2705or 5! \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705! Hug someone & release some oxytocin (funny how everything we give a hug, we always get one back\ud83d\ude09\n\n5 Focus on everything we\u2019re doing RIGHT and ignore any ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) celebrate all victories- no matter how small!\n\nRemember 2? We got out of bed? \u2705Did laundry? \u2705Reached out?\u2705 Showered? \u2705Ate? \u2705Or did nothing when that\u2019s exactly what we said we were gonna do?! \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705 Yasss, Queen! \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f\n\nRegardless of how much or how little gets done/short or long it takes us, A wise man once said, \u201cit\u2019ll all be okay in the end. If it isn\u2019t okay, it isn\u2019t the end\u201d. And that man was never wrong.\n\nI hope this helped, it really is gonna be okay! Feel free to DM!
