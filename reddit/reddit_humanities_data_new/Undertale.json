A good chunk of the comments there are just people haphazardly spamming their reaction image folders. Now I won't pretend we are that much better off without that, but at least the written jokes and answers require some effort\n\nThat's the two main ones, plus on a personal note (and this  is just me being petty having an \"old man yells at the youth\" moment), but I would actually like for reddit to stick to its purpose of being a discussion forum without  looking like an average twitter threads. If people wanna make jokes for them upvotes, let's see them put some actual effort into wording a funnie response instead of reaching for their memes folder. Let's have at least *some* standards.\n\nThey are allowed on r/WaterfallDump, our shitposting offshoot where they fit quite well.",
