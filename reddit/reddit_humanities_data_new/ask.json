            "I was near area 51 in Nevada.  I saw two flying objects, one was wobbling, they were both sky blue in color and became more easily visible when they moved between me and a cloud.  I saw two items fall from the one that was wobbling.  The wobbling object crashed further away.  I drove my truck to where the pieces fell from the wobbling object.  The pieces were sky blue in color.  \n\nOn the ground near where the pieces fell was a large shape that was sky blue in color.  I took many photos from different angles and many videos. I also recorded GPS coordinates of where the shape was located.\n\nWhen I touched the shape, a panel opened.  I saw a screen with an image of earth, the moon and the sun, and odd symbols.  Next to the screen were illuminated buttons.  I lifted one end of the shape to put it in my truck.  As I lifted one end of the shape, it rose into the air about 4 feet off the ground and stayed there.  I did not have straps to secure the shape in the bed of my truck.  I did not want the shape to leave my truck bed if I hit a bump in the road. I dug a hole and buried the shape.  I would like to sell the shape to the highest bidder or, in the alternative, give it to a party to study with a contract that gives me 85% of any profits derived from study of the shape.  The party must satisfy me that it has the technological ability to properly examine the shape and develop technology from study of the shape.  No US companies allowed.",

            "I love laying in bed! It's my favourite thing and I can do it for days on end. Been wondering myself if this is depression, but I just love the snuggling feeling of relaxing and be comfortable. I'm really enjoying myself just laying there",

I wont allow myself to do it because it will be the start of a depression spiral. Some times you gotta shoo out the flies before they multiply",
            "I can totally relate to this feeling. Sometimes, just laying in bed and doing nothing feels like the only thing you have energy for. It can be a sign of burnout, depression, or just needing a break. It's important to listen to your body and mind. If this feeling persists, consider talking to a mental health professional. They can help you figure out what's going on and provide support. In the meantime, try to incorporate small, enjoyable activities into your day to see if it helps lift your mood a bit.",

            "It might be a sign of depression or burnout. And even though it feels good to lay in bed all day when I get depressed, it also tends to make it worse. I've found that even doing some little things helps. Bare minimum is brush teeth, take a shower, and get dressed. Then I feel fine to lay in bed. At least it doesn't make me feel worse in the long run.",

But, once in a while, when it's a rainy day and both my wife and I are off, I think \"Yeah! Today's a good day to just stay right here with the missus until whenever.\"",

            "It's a sign of hermit. Just remember memento morri, that usually gets me to realize I gotta do something.",
            "Personally, I love it",
            "I genuinely like to do nothing.  In fact, I do everything (work, cook and clean) so I can do nothing in peace afterwards.",
            "Are you doing it by choice, or because nothing else seems to grab your interest, or like it might be enjoyable?",
            "Yeah but I'm also mentally unwell, so that might be the reason.",
            "I love the same thing.  Or just not leaving my house for days.  When I have days off from work, that is.  I hate going into public, too.  I'm starting to hate people in general.",

            "only for a couple hours, then i get bored or get a headache or feel guilty and do something productive",
            "No I hate it over everything, time goes by quick, 1 second passes, you can\u2019t get that second back. \n\nIt feels so exhausting and annoying when you wanna do something but lay in bed like a potato watching mornings go to nights.",
            "I enjoy it a little bit, maybe for 30 minutes after waking up on the weekends. But if I do it for an obscene amount of time I feel like I\u2019m wasting my life away. \n\nI\u2019ll wake up early on the weekends (6:45, which is still sleeping in for me) and just lay in bed until 7:20-7:30. I used to lay in bed until 10 or 11 when I had a lot of stressors and uncertainty in life, and I was miserable. While I \u201cenjoyed\u201d it in the moment, it honestly made me feel guilty. It sounds like you may be facing a bout of overall depression.\n\nMy weekends and days feel so much more fulfilling if I start them with a nice walk. Getting lots of outdoors time and a 5 mile walk in by 9AM on a Saturday is a great feeling. I feel productive. On weekdays I have to do these walks after work, because I don\u2019t get enough light in the morning.",
            "I work everyday so I only get to do it right before or after work but I do enjoy lazy laying around.",
            "Literally nothing? As in no music, no phone, not even daydreaming or thinking about stuff\n\nI love to sleep in and stay in bed napping sometimes, but thats not quite the same I think",
            "Sometimes you just need to rest and not do anything, not all the time you need to be productive cause we don\u2019t have 100% energy all the time and it\u2019s normal to feel that way and it\u2019s valid.

            "If you\u2019re loving it, it\u2019s probably not depression. If you can\u2019t help it and you feel numb or low or guilty, it might be depression.",

            "Yes, I've become quiet content with hanging out in my room on my bed allday. It's become a safe haven for me and the hours just fly by. I know I'm isolating myself but it's what I want. I never felt included in a social setting anyways. I find friendships to be awkward. When I'm In my bed I feel at home. I do my best to get out and avoid it but it's the first thought in my mind. I'm so drawn to it now. I lost my job and I've been glued to my bed since January. On the bright side it saves me money. I know it's not healthy but I can't stop. Depression maybe",

Dont discredit it.\n\nThings are always happening, no matter what. You need to accept that. You also need to accept that your body and mind are capable of adapting to almost any external stimuli. \n\nThe key is to know that if you\u2019re dealing with depression, it IS best to let yourself sit there and \u201cdo nothing\u201d.",

I don't think I was depressed in my childhood at all. I've never had an issue taking care of responsibilities but as soon as they're taken care of, I'm on the bed or couch doing something fun.

            "Yup. For me it\u2019s ADD related. I can dissociate so easily. It sometimes turns into maladaptive daydreaming. But I\u2019m in reasonable control of it. \n\nI\u2019m not a medical professional at all and can just speak from decades of psychiatric experiences. \n\nYou say you love just laying in bed. I love staying in bed but my head is too busy to do nothing so I usually read or scroll. But since you say \u201clove\u201d, to me, that doesn\u2019t say depression. It\u2019s something you enjoy which is good. If nothing brings you joy, happiness, or contentment anymore, those would be warning signs. Laying in bed and lacking the energy to get up is a warning sign. \n\nIt seems like this is new for you. What changed in your life recently? If it\u2019s burnout, it could just be your body saying it needs some recovery time. \n\nA warning sign to me is you say you\u2019re not as excited about life in general anymore. Excitement is a temporary emotion. I don\u2019t know how old you are but, as my psychiatrist would say, explore that emotion. When you say excitement, what do you mean? Do you mean excitement as in looking forward to what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Someone in their early 20s is excited about life which is a great thing. Not everyone has this and that\u2019s fine too. It also changes as you grow older. \n\nI\u2019m 42 and I\u2019m not excited about life in general. It is what it is. My life has a routine and excitement comes and goes. I create my own excitement. I\u2019m excited about the December holiday we have planned. I\u2019m excited about a new video game coming in October. \n\nUltimately, if this is something that\u2019s new, that\u2019s been going on for a while, it\u2019s something that is bothering you, or it\u2019s disruptive to your life (such as work or school), definitely get a medical professional\u2019s opinion.",

            "I find that when children won't talk to their parents it's because of a few factors. Could be one, or more. I don't mean for this to come off as judgmental, or that you're a bad parent.\n\nKids tend to stop sharing with their parents when they're used to getting in trouble for mundane things.  Breaking a plate/glass shouldn't require yelling, or discipline.\n\nKids also tend to shut out their parents when there is a lack of positive interaction. If they only hear about their flaws or ways to improve but never hear how they're doing a great job can take its toll on kids.\n\nLack of proper communication between parents and kids can also have an effect. It shouldn't be a one way street, even if you know best. \n\nControlling parents is probably the number 1 contributor to a kid not being open and honest with their parent. We all know, we made the exact mistake your kid is about to make. And we want to save them from that, but kids need to learn on their own sometimes. Those experiences are what lead to well adjusted adults.\n\nAnd a general lack of respect by the parents. You're the adult, yes, but that's your kid. And they learn from example, so if you cut them off mid sentences that teaches them their words/thoughts have little to no value.\n\nLasty inappropriate/inconsistent discipline can easily lead to a breakdown in honest communication. A constant argument is not healthy for either the child or parent. Too often a simple stern talking to turns into being grounded. Or you tell your kid they're grounded for X amount of days but never follow through. As a parent, you set the rules and the consequences. You also have to uphold that consistently. You can't tell your kid they're grounded for a week, but give up on it yourself after 3 days. You're teaching them consequences don't matter, aren't real.\n\nFor the particular scenario, as bad as it might sound, I would recommend asking your kid to have a sit down, not right this instant! Let her prepare herself, her thoughts. Emphasize that no disciplinary actions are going to happen as a result of your talk. Try not to push her to talk more than she wants, and make sure you show empathy. If she doesn't talk, then you can sit and hug her, reassuring you're not mad, you're scared and hurt that it's gotten to this point, and she feels she can't talk to you. For your part, the less you talk and stay quiet when she pauses, the better. \n\nYou want her to do the talking and open up. And that'll only happen when she trusts that you're there to help. And maybe that \"help\" means backing off, and just asking her to keep you in the loop. Ask her to stay home when she does the drugs, so that you know exactly where she is and if she's okay. \"I don't want you doing drugs, it's dangerous and makes me worry about you. But if you're going to do drugs, then I'd rather you do them here. That way if anything bad does happen, you have me to come to. And that means I'll do whatever is necessary right then. When you're ready to talk to me, I'm here. I just need you to know that I care, I yell because I care, we fight because I care.\"",

            "Are you the older sibling?\n\nI am a mental health therapist who specializes in addiction in adolescents, so this thread caught my attention.\u00a0\n\nYou can\u2019t compel a person to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s a foundational truth in mental health, too. The best therapist can\u2019t make a person healthy - they have to want it and pursue it on their own.\n\nSo to put it plainly, extra chores, grounding, compulsory counseling, etc., won\u2019t help. It may even do harm.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re the older sibling, do what you can to build a really close friendship with her, with no judgment and no frustration. In the field we call this unconditional positive regard. \u00a0\n\nBecome her confidant. Do it expecting nothing and it will open the doors to open conversation.\u00a0\n\nIn my experience, kids really want and need a person who is fully in their corner and who they can open up to about anything.\u00a0\n\nAnother commenter mentioned shame. I suspect that\u2019s really good insight. She is likely running from something.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m good at my job because I\u2019m good at making meaningful connections with kids. We often don\u2019t focus on addiction, behaviors, etc., for the first few weeks. Instead we focus on the student\u2019s story. I take a genuine interest in them.\u00a0\n\nThink of the drug as a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself. If you can build a relationship that allows her to be open about the real underlying problem, you\u2019ll be making real progress.\u00a0\n\nInvite her to do things with you. If you\u2019re driving, take her to get fast food with you, movies, etc. If she won\u2019t do it, randomly bring her ice cream. Recruit your parents into the plan to fund these expeditions if you need to.\u00a0\n\nGenuinely, this is just loving her in real outward, I intentional ways.\u00a0",

            "She has to talk to a therapist. Sounds like she\u2019s self medicating. Has she always been like this or is it recent? Any way she has suffered some abuse that nobody knows of?",
            "I came to see the answers, assuming the best ones would say the same thing basically: \n\nIt sounds like you don't have to have a relationship where you can get her to talk to you honestly.  \n\nIf you don't have that, you have to establish one if you want to help her.  It may come down to sitting down with her and sharing something vulnerable about yourself.   Even starting the conversation with a shared experience.  Good or bad... but good is better. \n\nI wouldn't first bring up the issue you are worried about.  Get her trust by sharing your own vulnerablity.  \n\nAt some point you have to tell her you are \"worried about her, and that sounds selfish, but you really want to listen.\"  \n\nAnd also tell her that if she isn't comfortable talking to you, ask her who she would trust to talk to.  We can't do this all alone. \n\nLet her talk if she will. \n\n  \nThere are a lot of reasons kids get stuck doing drugs to cope.  They either need someone in the short term to help them cope, and longer term to work on themselves in a way to live with the stress and trauma of life. \n\n  \nBTW, people dont' get seizures from NyQuil and THC... you can get that from alcohol and BZD withdrawl.  That is concerning.  When she had her seizure was she admitted to the ER?   If so they would have disclosed to your parent(s) what her drug tox screen was.  She's 13, they would have to by law.   Based on what could have been in her system, the advice might be different and more agressive. \n\nCompassion and empathy over judgement.   Kids will hide everything when there is judgement.",

Whatever pain she\u2019s trying to numb should be taken seriously when she does open up. Taking unidentified drugs is being at a point where you really don\u2019t care about what happens to yourself\u2026 the adults around her need to figure out how she could have gotten to that point, when it changed, and use that to help get her better.\n\nFor mental health magnesium and ashawaghanda are great for reducing anxiety and irritation.",

Understandable, given there has been some serious physical harm she did to herself. It's a responsible thing to want to take away dangerous substances especially from a minor\n\nAssuming there wasn't something more severe that has caused her underlying motivation to use drugs (eg. sexual abuse or whatever) - it could simply be that she feels it remains the ONLY thing she has control over. Even if she knows you guys love her and care for her, and EVEN knows the fact that what she is doing is not good/right - she may continue to do it SIMPLY because if she listens to you guys and stop, the label from the family to her will be \"Stupid\". Just that.  \nShe may simply think that since you guys already thinks she's STUPID, to suddenly stop the drugs = admitting to herself that she is STUPID.\n\nDoes that make sense?  \nWhen I talked about eating disorders vibes earlier, some ED patients precisely don't eat because that is the only thing they feel they have control over - when they give that up they will also be admitting to themselves (the same opinion from everyone else) that they are a Failure. That is much more terrifying than stopping.\n\nSo maybe think about whether your family may have unintentionally, inadvertently judged her into a corner she cannot actually come out from her current situation without much dignity intact? You mentioned that she just wants you \"to be okay\" with her doing drugs - I think what she really meant was \"I just want you to be okay with who I am right now, stupid, failure or not - and love me even when I'm dumb, not only when I'm doing everything right.\" This would also explain why she has been so easily influenced by a group at school - those peers are giving her a solid sense of identity which I feel she may not have been getting from home.

Maybe it is - in which case I think she could very well be an asshole.\n\nI don\u2019t really judge people for using drugs, but when someone still does it even after seizures and whatnot like this troubled young woman then they probably have a problem",
            "She won\u2019t open up about any problems but This might just be the best response I\u2019ve gotten. Someone actually trying to help instead of ridiculing someone who is just trying to help someone they love and are out of ideas.",

Try to support her as much as you can without supporting her addictions. As others have said, there\u2019s definitely something underlying going on so try to work on building trust between you two and see if you can help her through what may be causing her to act this way. \n\nAnother thing is how is she getting these drugs and where is she doing them? If she\u2019s getting them from and doing them with a friend, she obviously needs hard rules from your parents that she cannot be around those people. 13 yr olds should not just be deciding what they do, where they go, and who they\u2019re with. It\u2019s very concerning where these drugs are coming from in order for a 7th grader to have access to them. The age she\u2019s at is extremely influenced by the people around them, so she\u2019s just being pulled in further by the people who she\u2019s surrounding herself with. That\u2019s for sure one of the first things that needs to change asap.",
