            "Have you tried to discuss with him your issues with how he is choosing to play them game? Does he realize that he is causing problems and doesn't care about other peoples' fun, or is he oblivious to how his choices are effecting others? And why is it that kicking him from the table isn't an option, because that makes it seem like he has a lot of emotional leverage on you for some reason.",
            "Gaming at the table involves compromise. And it sounds like the rest of the party is bending over backward to accommodate his nonsense (willingly or unwillingly) to keep with the social contract, but he is not compromising or making any accommodation for what the rest of the party thinks or wants. And he needs to.\n\nI hate to suggest potentially antagonistic behavior, but if he's not going to bend and he can't go, then there needs to be a mechanism to prevent him from tanking the campaign. And that might have to be a veto process somewhere in the system.",
            "I'll try to pull the party in more on these decisions. This particular instance was a deal made with an NPC and he intentionally did it on the sly so other party members wouldn't notice, as in literally talked to me in the other room and he was talking to the NPC while players were doing other things, so their characters likely wouldn't have noticed anyway but I think for the sake of fairness I can do something to bring them into the decision-making process even against the behest of the problem player.\n\nThis is a good example of his interparty conflict that I think is at a detriment to the game. I can tell it doesn't sit well with the other players and when brought up to him in character, he basically says, the party can do what they want, but he's made the decision his character would make and the party can follow him if they choose. To me it seems like a manipulation tactic against the party, the vibe in the room that I inferred was he has made a decision and the consequences fall on them should they choose to go the other way and split the party. He would take responsibility for it if he were to be put on the spot, but he seems to capitalize on the unlikelihood of a serious call out and really shifts the pressure of the decision onto the players even though he basically took away their agency in the decision.",
            "We've had a talk before and he was receptive enough during the conversation, I haven't come outright and said that it's interfering with my fun, which I may bring up after the next session if it continues to be an issue. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if he's oblivious or not. I think he sees himself as a \"wiLD cARd\" not unlike Charlie in that episode of It's Always Sunny. If you're not familiar, basically chaotic neutral for the sake of it and he chose his character goals and those are his character's goals. \n\nAs for kicking him, it's a fairly tight group of friends who have been playing together for 2 or 3 years now. Prior to this, I've played games with him on and off for about a decade. He's part of the group and while D&D is what we are there for, we are also there to see and hang out with each other. This behavior is only at the game table and otherwise he's a fun to hang out with, good dude.",
            "Perhaps... I'll try to think of a viable in game reason to make veto's work. I may also try to reorientate his goals, as they are supposed to be a heroic group whose primary motivation is, without going into specifics, to defeat the evil power. He's opting to work for himself rather than the goal of the party and if that's the case, it might be necessary to reroll a character to fit the world. He can have his own motivations beyond \"fight the bad guys,\" but they shouldn't supersede it, and the players in the party would appreciate a game with a little more compromise on his part.",
            "Don\u2019t allow him to pull you into another room. Even if he is on his own have the discussion with the npc at the table.",
            "Ordinarily I would suggest he create a new character (after all, why would the other characters have a valid narrative reason for hanging around with this kind of person? He should create someone that they *would* want to hang around) but since you indicated that it's been a problem in other campaigns, that points to a pattern. It suggest to me that he'll simply create another, similar character with antisocial tendencies. So then the veto will end up moving from his behavior to the whole character creation process, and he'll almost certainly be passive aggressive about that.",
            "That's the move. My frustration is that I need to basically be on guard against the guy the whole time. Which I feel puts us on antagonistic footing and that's not how I want to DM; for me it's not a fun way to play. The other thing is, I can trust the other characters to put the party first, or on low chance they are acting selfishly as a character, they are still playing for broader fun of more players than just themselves. He's the only one I have to be this way with.",
            "I talked it over with one of my players and he said when the party has potential to be steamrolled by the problem player, and particularly with big decisions, he's going to call for a vote. That way even if they don't go with the vote, everybody's stances will be out in the open and even if he goes his own way, he can't feign ignorance to the will of the party.",
            "It\u2019s not conducive to a healthy table.",
            "I agree. I'm considering having a talk with him after the next game. I've already had to talk to him once."

From my understanding, devils are easy to work with conceptually: making deals, trying to make their way to the top, and ultimately following rules. Someone might want to take over a country by opening a portal for an army of devils from the hells. \n\nFrom how I understand demons though, they're a lot more \"lol, I'm evil,\" so I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around making ones with their own personality. Plus, I can't see demons interacting with the material plane as much as devils, since devils are much easier to work with as a mortal, and might provide incentives for letting them breach into the material plane.",

            "Apologies in advance for the wall of text...TLDR at bottom\n\nHey all, looking for some help for my son. He's age 6 and autistic but not profoundly so, in other words he's fully verbal, can communicate well and understand you. He's very clever and has an extremely vivid imagination. But he has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions, reading emotions and emotional cues in others and is subject to fits of rage. It's been really tough on the family trying to find ways to limit these and esnure they don't result in violence against others.\n\nIn my youth I played a lot of tabletop D&D but haven't played it in many years, (I never was a DM just a regular player). But I've kept up with the genre via video games (most recently Baldur's Gate III). My son loves watching me play BG3 but it gets tricky because its not age appropriate most of the time. Also, those aforementioned fits of rage are often triggered by the cessation of a beloved activity like watching TV shows or video games. So I'm trying to find an outlet for him that will not lead to emotional meltdowns but that engages his imagination and creativity and allows him to explore RPG style adventures with me.\n\nI've never DMd before but am willing to try, I found this package called [Little But Fierce](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/395165/Little-but-Fierce-Starter-Edition) which just takes 5e rules and simplifies them for young kids so I was going to start with that (e.g. you can't be 'killed' only 'injured/knocked out'). Also heard good things about Lost Mine of Phandelver as well so that might be a good candidate for the next campaign. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for any general good advice, especially if you've run a campaign with young kids before but I did think of some specific questions as well:\n\n1)Gear - what do I need as a DM? I have tons of dice, I have one of those dry erase map kits for drawing the dungeon. I have the Little But Fierce story campaign (which includes character sheets)? Monster Manual I assume?\n\n2)He's very visual so I was thinking visual cues would be really helpful, like for example the Monster Manual he'll really enjoy, also was thinking of a visual of his character on his sheet.\n\n3)Have you any experience with the digital versions (D&D Beyond)? Was looking at their stuff and lots of options there. But thought maybe start with the monster manual that I could have up on a laptop next to our game board to show them what they are fighting?\n\nmuch thanks, I really appreciate it.\n\nTLDR - son is 6 yrs old and autistic, looking for suggestions on campaigns, gameplay, DM advice etc",

Kobold fight club says it's very deadly, but I've been told not to listen to that too much.

I have an idea to run a series of encounters where \"evil\" version of the BG3 party attacks the \"tabletop\" party.\n\nI have just one doubt: one of those players uses Phalar Aluve which, for those who don't know, Is a +1 weapon which can either \"sing\" (giving the benefits of a bless spell, sans  the concentration) or \"shriek\" (which is the bane spell + a bit of thunder damage) . Now, there is clearly a discrepacy between the power level of magic items in BG and the tabletop (I mean, c'mon, it does all of that as a Rare weapon!), so I was wondering if there was some way to balance Phalar Aluve while still keeping the flavor of the weapon itself.

If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\" I am thinking I'd interpret the two sentences here independently? As in, if a player uses some other method to \"discern the illusion for what it is\" for example by casting Identify on the object that the illusion is on, or Detect Magic, etc, then it would trigger them being able to see through the illusion, right? Or is the successful investigation check the only way to break the illusion?",

Her character's motive is primarily money, which is at the bottom of all the other characters' priority lists, so they'll literally just give her the loot if she wants it. Any ideas on how to incentivize her character to get in the action some more?\n\nThe other player I know broadly how to get her engaged - one of the things about her character is that she *really* loves bunnies, but as a barbarian, is afraid she'll hurt them if she tries to pet them. So, I naturally want to give her a magical bunny friend that she can pet without fear, and I'm thinking something like an amulet with a spell that summons one.\n\nWhat spell would be the best way to do this, in terms of mechanics - find familiar? Some kind of summon spell? Maybe even summon steed, re-flavored as a giant rabbit? (Since this is just for fluff, I'm willing to ignore class restrictions and time limits on the spell) \n\nAlso, any ideas for good bunny-related plot hooks or ideas about how a character might find, or be rewarded with, such an item?

            "Videogames do this by allowing you to fail and then giving you retrys to do it different. Harder for how dnd is generally played but not impossible.\n\nHere's how I'd do it. First the players need to save a retired cleric/bard adventurer. NPC promises to help them out in the future. Then later have them go up against a combat encounter they would need to use proper tactics to beat. They run in blind, as usual, and the NPC shows up to save them (by healing and allowing them to retreat not by blasting all the enemies). Normally not ideal but you've layed the groundwork so that it doesn't feel unearned or a deus-ex-machina. NPC says \"Damn you guys are strong enough that should have been easy. Did you do X, Y or Z?\" and \"Well you should try again but do X and Y. Also it's gonna get more dangerous for you from now on so you should try coordinating better\".\n\nSecond advice I'd give is if you are on a VTT start showing health bars. You want players to have enough information that they can make an informed decision but not enough that the decision is obvious. 5e falls on the 'way too little information' side of that equation IMO. Not letting players know the HP, AC, Resistances, abilities etc. of you monster makes sense from a realism standpoint but it is a tradeoff with gameplay enjoyment.",

This seems to be a unique benefit to Holy Symbols (and their accompanying classes) over Arcane Foci as far as the PHB is concerned. The closest Arcane Focus gets is \"crystal...specially constructed staff...or some similar item\" which to me leaves *a tiny bit* of room for interpretation. \n\nI'd personally be fine bending this and allowing them to commission an item that combines a weapon and arcane focus for a big chunk of gold but there's nothing about that explicitly in the rules.

You have to look at older editions to dig up the rich lore of the Realms. \n\nFor example, the Moonshaes (which you cited) has at least two trilogies of novels set in it (maybe more by now), entries for several key locations from those novels in the old Forgotten Realms Atlas, and at least one entire splatbook for them. But you have to go dig up older editions to get at that lore.\n\nI'm guessing that a lot of the advice e.g. \"there's 45 years of lore\" from the other posters are from people who are familiar with those older editions (as I am). It's absolutely up to you if you want to go digging for it (and the Wiki usually cites which sourcebooks it takes info from) but it's definitely there if you want to take the time and effort to get it. On the other hand, Exandria's books are certainly more current and available, at least from a hardcopy perspective (and for things like digital tools).",

(The statblock also mentions that the imp's statistics are the same in each form except for the speeds, so that would be up to you if that just means the numbers given or the abilities that it has as well). However, if it's invisible, nothing could hit it with an attack of opportunity since that requires sight. \n\nRealistically, it shouldn't affect things too much. Help is just advantage on a single attack roll, which isn't so overpowered that it'll ruin your game. If you really need to deal with the imp, AOEs would still hit it, and that would also trigger a concentration check to stay invisible.

A lot of DMs either adapt or just straight-up use the old lore because there *isn't* 5e-era lore written for what they are looking for.",
            "Yeah, that's your real issue to overcome right there. But it's awesome that you're taking on the challenge. The other thing that can help is to not give the NPC more than a couple characteristics you can keep in mind, and then filter everything the NPC says or does through those characteristics. Things like fancy, proud, sultry, lazy etc.",
            "Well it sounds like your mind is made up. Unfortunately,  balance-wise it's a real toss-up on whether that will be the right amount of challenge.  If the PC is fully fresh and knows this is the final fight of the adventure then they can go nova, using up resources on every attack, in that case the enemy might get sromped.  On the other hand if the PC has used some resources or is trying to hold a reserve, they might get overwhelmed.",
            "You don't need a character sheet for them to interact with beyond combat. Creatures often have social skill, which inform your portrayal in a social encounter. You should have notes about them as an NPC for that too.  \n\nYou can print a stat block or write it out. You can change up the spells. Again, you don't need a full character to do any of this.\n\nThe point is that whatever actual stats you use, you want to build them like a Creature, not a PC.",

I think the whole team can one shot the little rats easily, and a couple of them can do 20-30 damage pretty reliably too. I wanted this to be a big impressive first battle that would let them have fun chopping through a bunch of stuff without too much difficulty.\n\nWe've fought big groups of kobolds and goblins with like 3 or 4 big guys backing them up before and that didn't seem like such a challenge, but again maybe we just got luckier than I realise.\n\nedit: if we were using some version of carry through damage rules too would that change the calculation much? https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/homebrew-house-rules/72484-carry-through-damage#:\\~:text=Damage%20in%20excess%20of%202x,hp%20goes%20into%20the%20orc.",

Sex sometimes happens but it's always fade to black, no further details on that beyond I grab her hand and lead her upstairs or the equivalent. But we might have some flirting, or other romantic scenes. There is an element of weirdness, but you do get used to that after a little while. Honestly I think I've gotten to the point where I'm more comfortable flirting with my friends as an NPC than I am with real people which is its own problem! It is also interesting to step across gender lines when having those scenes as well. I (a cis straight man) have played as the NPC in a number of lesbian couples now, as well as a few with two guys. It's also interesting as long with everyone is comfortable and cool with it to be at a table with a couple and one of them decides to start flirting with someone. That can be funny to be a guy flirting with another guy as I am sitting next to his wife who is trying not to laugh. \n\nBut you can have some great roleplaying moments that come from relationships and the elements that can add to a game. Those have been some of my favorite NPCs and a lot of great moments over the years. Both for funny moments and really serious and dramatic moments. I've had a few weddings that have been interesting to play out too and decide that element of my worldbuilding and work with the player on what they want to do for that.",

        "content": "Background - been playing TTRPGs in some function or form for \\~7-8 years, familiar with DMing but not a master by ANY means. I make liberal use of \"rule of cool\".\n\nFor reference to paint the situation, my group (3 people, rogue, druid, ranger) was at the end of a dungeon, 2nd level, had just killed the necromancer boss and were finishing with cleaning up the skeleton minions in the cave. Rogue had been having a bad night with rolls in general, goes down to a skeleton near the end of the fight when there's only two left. Ranger hasn't missed an attack roll yet this session, but takes a critical hit from a skeleton that puts him down to 4 hit points. The Druid, who had been separated from the group for a while fighting the necromancer, returns to see their friends all dying or unconscious, and drops a skeleton while drawing the aggro of the second. \n\nNow, the druid already had very low health after fighting the necromancer, four hit points to be exact. The skeleton beats his armor class and rolls an 8 on the damage roll, which would be more than enough to also knock him unconscious. Despite the ranger being wounded, I think he probably could have dispatched the final skeleton on his own, but for some reason in the moment I decided it might be cooler to have the druid go down to 1 HP, and keep the group on edge thinking he died when he pulls himself back up to fight.\n\nIt didn't seem too bad to me in the moment, the whole group was excited, and after this the Druid even rolled a nat 20 which led to the last two of them dispatching the final monster. The druid feels like a badass for surviving a huge sword wound and the party is extremely excited about escaping death just barely, everyone seems happy. I probably shouldn't worry about it too much but it keeps rattling around in my head.\n\nFor additional reference, my players are very new (like, 1st-2nd time playing DND new) and I want to give them moments that make them feel cool without them feeling like \"we only lived because the DM let us\". I'm never gonna tell them that I fudged the roll or anything, but it still feels weird. Anyone got some advice on feeling less self-conscious about moments like this, or if I should be feeling bad about it at all?",

            "It's okay to feel uncomfortable with \"lying.\" That's probably a normal and good thing. But in my opinion, as DM, your word is final. The dice don't dictate what happens, but they do help to facilitate the story you're telling because it's the structure of how the game is played, obviously. If you want the players to have an epic, hardwon victory, you have every right to fudge the dice and let that happen. Honestly, I wish I followed my own advice more. I've TPK'd my players twice and it was due to strict adherence to the dice. LMOP and I rolled max goblins for a random encounter, and they had surprise. Wiped the party in two turns. It's not that fun, especially at early levels.",

Neither is wrong.\n\nI'm currently running a solo/duet? Dragon of Icespire Peak campaign (I never know which one to choose, but it's 1 dm, 1 PC) she is a sorcerer and it's her first time playing D&D. Shes a writer and very attached to her first character. So I have definitely fudged a few numbers to keep her alive. She has 1 sidekick, who is a warrior sidekick, a mini-fighter. So no healing for the PC. Her going unconscious basically means a death unless she rolls a Nat 20. I haven't brought in a spellcaster sidekick for heals because I don't want too many NPC sidekicks making up the party. I might homebrew the warrior sidekick into a paladin instead of a fighter. At least swap second wind for lay on hands. But she's level 3 now, so the fudged rolls have slowed down. Levels 1 and 2 definitely had some fights that would have been anticlimactic deaths.

That's just the risk of fudging, that at some point players work it out, and they can't even feel 100% on the times where fudging *doesn't* occur, because they know you've fudged before.\n\nI hold myself to a high standard as a DM, and if my expectation for the table is that the player not fudge their rolls, then the same has to be true of me as well from my perspective.",
            "I heard this pretty popular DM say once, \n\n\"How many hitpoints do your monsters / encounters / BBEGs have\"\n\n\n\nAs many hitpoints as the group is still having fun..",
            "I don't fudge dice because I don't think its fun. I feel bad for lying, and quite frankly it's boring to me and makes DMing less interesting.\n\nIf you don't like fudging, don't do it. Simple as that.",
            "From the perspective of a player whose GM has fudged rolls and readily admitted to it, I don't think you should feel bad. There are definitely times when the dice are rolling badly, or when a particular roll would end up making for an unsatisfying session, and if you think things would be better going a certain other way, it's your game.\n\n\nPersonally, I've never felt cheated when I find out that my GM has done a little fudging, but not everybody shares my feelings on the matter. Ultimately, it's up to you if you think it's something worth doing or not, and your players may disagree. My one piece of advice is, if you're going to do it then do it very sparingly.",
            "Set yourself a deadline for how long you will continue to do this, a typical one is once they reach level 3 and start getting class features. You could also choose an appropriate milestone in your storyline. Inform your players when you do this: \"Hey guys, just so you know, I have been taking it a little easy on you up until now as you were still getting comfortable with the game and your characters abilities. Going forward, expect threats to potentially be more lethal. I am giving you this advanced warning so you can plan accordingly and don't feel blindsided.\"",
            "Yeah I personally don't fudge because players know it's all bogus",
            "To answer the title, it depends, but your example was a good situation for it. As for advice, figure out what you're doing and why you're doing it. I highly advise you get away from \"liberally\" using the rule of cool and keep it as an occasional tool for specific purposes. I mean these things in two ways. \n\n1) Look at each moment and ask yourself why you're bending the rules. In your example, you were not simply trying to give a cool moment, you were trying to build excitement for the game for new players. This was exactly the right time for this kind of thing. Great job! But I highly advise you don't ever break your world or laws of reality, time, and space to allow anything just because it's \"cool.\" That is a difficult door to close once you've opened it and the players have walked through. However, I'm the type of player to get invested in whatever game world I find myself in and don't do \"wacky\" games. If you and your players are into that, this is less important.\n\n2) Decide what you and your players are looking to get from and do with D&D. Are you looking at it like a game, where you follow rules, pursue goals, overcome challenges, and win? Or are you looking for a tool for telling a story together. In the former, it's more important that you follow the rules, though there is still some room for the DM to mess with things behind the screen, which is the advantage of a GM vs a computer.\n\nFor example, when I play, I want to know that I won or lost based on my choices, with some luck involved obviously because the game has dice. I want to know the world is what it is, so I never want to be asked what I find in a treasure chest or behind a door or in a cave. When my current DM asked about what magic items we'd be looking for, after a back and forth he mentioned \"giving\" me a particular one. I noticed that word choice but didn't take it literally. But then the next session, we found that item in the place we already were. Sure, it was \"hidden\", but it mentally ripped me right out of the world.  \n  \nWhen I first started the group I'm currently running, I did more fudging of die rolls to try to curate the experience. But my players made comments when I had a few situations where a character could have been killed but wasn't. Funnily enough, those were examples where the bad guys' actions to not kill the characters actually made perfect sense, but the comments still told me those players didn't want me to pull punches to keep their characters alive. So I make fewer rolls behind the screen now, with a few to keep it varied and them guessing. \n\nSo while I think you did right in your example because of the specific circumstances, I don't think you should get used to doing so and definitely don't let the players to get used to it. And when you do, keep it hidden.",
            "Sometimes DMs have to fudge rolls in order to provide a more fun gaming experience. \n\nThis is literally the reason, why DM-Screens exist.",
            "You just haven\u2019t gained enough experience with the players yet to play without cheating. It's best to think of these as accessory wheels for a child's bike. Over time, you will ride without them. Here people share their opinions. Personally, I NEVER use dice juggling as a GM. One of my biggest disappointments as a player: the character dies. I understand that the GM forgot about my tactical trick, which saves the character\u2019s life. I want to say this. But the GM is already saying a different result of the attack/damage. This kills all my attempts to play strategy.",
            "Yes, sort of. It's a game so it doesn't ultimately matter but if we're talking about it from a pure GMing perspective, this was the wrong choice to make. Don't fudge dice, let your players play out the story.\n\nWhy roll dice if you're going to ignore the outcome?\n\nThe druid would have rolled a nat 20 on their death save and that would have been even more awesome. But you didn't trust the game or the players to deliver, so you got a more artificial and less awesome moment.",
            "As long as you don't care about the integrity of your game, no.",
            "Fudging dice is just part of the game, I feel. It's not a competition between DM and players, you're an arbitrator in a collaborative game experience. The dice aren't immutable law, especially when stacked up against everyone having fun.\n\nDid someone just roll damage enough to take a bad guy down to three or less HP? No they didn't, the bad guy quietly has three fewer HP than rolled and the player can celebrate a takedown.\n\nIs someone taking an absolute beating from nothing more than a shit luck streak? Nah that last dice attacking them clearly didn't show an 18, it was definitely a 4. I describe their character making a lucky dodge to safety.\n\nDid a helper NPC just land a killing blow on a major bad guy? Not on my watch, not when a party member is next in initiative and I know they're excited to execute a big move they've been prepping. Oh dear looks like the NPC damage forgot to be subtracted.",
            "You should see it as a weakness of the system. We choose TTRPG systems so we can generate narratives we find engaging and fun, and in this case you had to break the rules. Think on that if you find it happening often.",
            "They always know.\nThat's why you have the screen.\n\nSo now they know every success may have been granted by the DM despite shitty tactics.\nAnd every failure could be because the DM simply didn't think the baddies should be getting stomped like this.  (Or they had a bad day, OR they have a personal issue with one or more of the players).\n\nRoll out in the open prevents any questions like that and keeps the players on their toes.",

            "Not fudging is not a sign for a good DM, just a different view point, so the \"high standard\" comment feels odd.\nI agree, that you shouldn't fudge in general, but sometimes the players have a streak of bad luck and can be at death's door for anticlimactic reasons. That's where I draw the line. Also remember that you have the sole control on what the players encounter and it only takes one misjudgement to send the players in a dire situation. I also somewhat believe that if you planned to have 4 enemies in the room but your party is so low that even 2 would be a hard fight, lowering the count or only using basic attacks is practically the same as fudging.",

            "Which is why I narrate through those sections. One issue is that DMs make the mistake of just  skipping through the bad rolls, but you can get positive story out of them. \n\nI also tend to play tactics based on opponents, not whether the part is doing well. If it's a hard fight, it's a hard fight, and the party can work out how to get through it. Of course I've run into the opposite as well, my glorious \"elites\" getting postholed by the party, and I have the story of the campaign adapt to that too. The bad guys start taking them more seriously, but at the same time, their reputation grows by leaps and bounds.\n\nThe bad moments are only anticlimactic because it's viewed as being an aberration, rather than looking for a way that it fits within the story, so people fall into the trap of seeing them as something to be avoided.",

        "content": "***A bit of a backstory (skippable):***\n\n>!I've been DMing my very first campaign for nearly 3 years now. Players are at level 10 and the campaign is drawing to an end. They had returned (once again) to the city which was the starting point and the centerpiece of our campaign. Hence, they know many locations, NPCs there and had made many friends and enemies. As our last session ended shortly after their return I decided to not plan for anything for our next session and instead ask the players what they would like to do in the city. Two of them only expressed the desire to follow a plot conflict I had brought up last session (there is no urgency tied to it though). The third player, however, came up with several of his own ideas which gave me a lot of material to work with.!<\n\n>!At first I was a bit disappointed by the lack of ideas from the two players but then I started thinking back about the whole campaign and realised that it had always been like this. Two were reactive and the third was proactive but because there had always been a lot for them to react to, it never was an issue.!<\n\n***The point of the post:***\n\nI want to say that both styles of play are great for DnD. However, both of them can be problematic if you have only one type of players.\n\n**If your party consists solely of reactive players**\u00a0then you might eventually feel a lot of pressure and responsibility for carrying the story forward and if you run out of plot hooks and ideas mid-session then you might find your players staring at you and waiting for another call for adventure.\u00a0*You will have to be proactive all the time and that is not easy for a DM.*\n\n**If your party only has proactive players**\u00a0then you might struggle to keep up with their decisions, struggle to have them follow your main plot hook and you will find yourself improvising and creating new locations and NPCs out of the blue all the time.\u00a0*Being reactive all the time can be extremelly stressful and draining for a DM.*\n\n**If you are a player**, maybe think about how you approach the game and whether you can make the life of your DM a bit easier once in a while. If you are very proactive, then consider just following the plot hook your DM presented and let him lead a more linear story for once before you streer the campaign elsewhere with your own ideas once more. If you are mostly only reactive, then try to come up with a plot (or an idea) of your own and bring it up in your next session. Seeing you unexpectedly taking matters into your hands will likely cheer your DM up and make him certain you really do care about his campaign.\n\n**If you are a DM**\u00a0and you feel like you are having issues with your party's reactivity or proactivity, don't hesitate to bring it up. If you feel like they are only reactive, then tell them that you would love to build the campaign also around their own ideas, let them know they can take an initiative if they feel like it. If you feel like they smother you with neverending proactivity, then maybe suggest they give you a heads up in between sessions so that you can better prepare for whatever they wish to follow. You need to have fun as well and constant improvising may be fun for every DM.\n\n**If you are a player and you feel like your DM will not let you be proactive**\u00a0then don't hold back and bring it up. You should be forming your story and campaign together and you should always have a chance to affect the world with your own ideas.\n\n**PS1:**\u00a0I don't have an advice for DMs who are purely reactive because I can't imagine such campaigns would last long unless you have an extremelly proactive players! (it would be cool to see such a campaign though)\n\n**PS2:**\u00a0For the sake of this post, I disregarded the existence of passive players who neither initiate actions nor react to the presented ones. I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD (or at least that it ruins fun for others unless previously agreed upon).\n\n**PS3:**\u00a0Obviously I know that most players will encompass both styles of play to some extend so I just simplified it for this post (the two \"reactive\" players of mine also had moments of proactivity which caught me off guard a few times).\n\n**Tldr:**\u00a0Both reactive and proactive styles of play are great but can be problematic if one exists without the other at your table. Whether you are a player or a DM, try to reflect on your own reactivity and proactivity and consider whether it might be causing issues at your table. If you feel like someone else's level of activity is causing issues, then don't hesitate and bring it up before it's too late.",

            "I get what you're saying but this post sounds awful prescriptive.\n\nI enjoy doing a small amount of setup and reacting to my player's choices (situation-based play). My players however are quite passive, so I tend to shoulder moving the plot a bit more than maybe I would like. **But, that's just how it is.** Due to multiple different factors you will never have a perfect group.\n\nInstead, it's about deciding on the style of game **everyone at the table wants to play.** My table never even brings up the idea of a sandbox game because I don't want to run it and my players wouldn't enjoy it. Over time we have figured out that an episodic style of mini-arcs makes it easy for my players to have clear goals but also lets me prep 2-3 session-long situations that they are comfortable reacting to, rather than a campaign-wide situation-based playstyle.\n\nTL;DR Don't tell people how to play. Discuss with your players what playstyle/game would work best for your table.",
            "I think that the point that you are missing is that this is just a hobby, that you can't change people, and that if people have to make a lot of effort to change who they are to play, then even assuming that you can find a fit, it's not going to last very long because people will generally fall back into their usual patterns.\n\nIn addition the part that I dislike is \"I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD.\" Sorry but no, once more, it's a hobby, played amongst friends, and even if some people are generally passive, it does not mean that they don't have a place at the table, and that they don't contribute on some other levels and enjoy the game just by being there with their friends, maybe infrequently.\n\nIn the end,  and beyond the proactivity/passivity of players, it's the general agreement about the style of play that matters. Proactive players might be more comfortable in a sandbox-style campaign, reactive players more comfortable in a story-arc campaign, but the main point is that people are not stereotypes.\n\nIn the end, rather than labelling people and putting them into boxes (especially labelling people as \"reactive\" compared to \"proactive\" can lead to ressentiment), I think it's always better to discuss openly about what people enjoy and see if a compromise can be reached about the type of expected play.",
            "Yeah I agree and I think it's great you make it work with your players this way. I especially like how you described the \"episodic playstyle\" which you formed over time.\n\nIt's always about finding the best possible compromise for everyone involved.",
            ">\"I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD.\" Sorry but no, once more, it's a hobby, played amongst friends, and even if some people are generally passive,\u00a0\n\nThis is definitely something we will just have to agree on disagreeing. I was part of a one shot where one player had no goals for his character yet refused to interact with what the DM prepared. His character was presented as a pacifist and honestly, the player singlehandedly ruined that one-shot. Maybe I am building my opinion about passive playing on an extreme example but I think you need to be at least willing to interact with the world if you want to play DnD. You cannot just sit at the table and say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\", watch your friends die and expect everyone at the table to have fun (unless a very passive playstyle is OK with everyone and agreed upon beforehand).\n\n>Proactive players might be more comfortable in a sandbox-style campaign, reactive players more comfortable in a story-arc campaign, but the main point is that people are not stereotypes.\n\nI agree with this but if a DM struggles to run a sandbox-style campaign and has only proactive players, what is your suggestion? Because such cases happen. Your response makes it seem like people will always just click without any further communication which is not true at all... often you need to work hard to make things work for everyone.\n\nI am actually lucky with having cool players and only after 3 year I realised that two of them are more reactive and the third is proactive, and that is because everything is working just fine and we are all enjoying the campaign but I am sure not everyone will be this lucky.\n\n>I think that the point that you are missing is that this is just a hobby, that you can't change people\n\nWho is talking about changing? Very often you will have a shy player who is afraid to take the spotlight (although he wants to!) so just discussing it with him and encouraging him may be enough to help him overcome his fears. He's not gonna suddenly turn into a arrogant prick... you're just gonna help him enjoy the game more and put forward his own ideas by overcoming his natural shyness.",
            ">You cannot just sit at the table and say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\"\n\nI think that you are confusing two things, one is a player who is mostly passive in general (what 4e called a \"watcher\" - A watcher is a casual player who comes to the game because he wants to be part of the social event. A watcher might be shy or just really laid back. He wants to participate, but he doesn\u2019t really care if he\u2019s deeply immersed, and he doesn\u2019t want to be assertive or too involved in the details of the game, rules, or story. He enjoys the game by being part of a social circle.) and, in your case, someone who actively resists playing the game because there is a misfit between the DM's and his expectations.\n\nIt's very different, and this new \"pacifist\" trend is only a problem in games where violence is expected as part of the playstyle or the universe. But when it manifests, it's not \"passivism\", it's actually militantism and being active, although in a direction opposite to what the DM is expecting.\n\nAnd, if it's part of the setting/game, it would be perfectly appropriate for a character to say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\". It would not be appropriate to a combat focussed game, but there are tons of games in which it would be perfectly appropriate.\n\nDon't judge, and in particular don't judge watchers, it's a perfectly legitimate way to play.\n\nOn the other hand, a player who purposefully creates a character that will not engage with the adventure or other players is a problem, not necessarily inherently, but because of the misfit of expectations.\n\n>I agree with this but if a DM struggles to run a sandbox-style campaign and has only proactive players, what is your suggestion? Because such cases happen.\n\nWhich is exactly why my point of view is that it's useless (in addition to possibly being demeaning) to label players in terms of Proactive/reactive, it's more constructive to discuss about what they actually want to play together.\n\n>I am actually lucky with having cool players and only after 3 year I realised that two of them are more reactive and the third is proactive, and that is because everything is working just fine and we are all enjoying the campaign but I am sure not everyone will be this lucky.\n\nGood for you, but I hope you realise that this is something that came afterwards, so it's not an indication of what works and what does not. Moreover, my experience is that some players are proactive in some segments of the game and more passive in others. For example, some people are very proactive in combat, but much less in roleplaying because of shyness. Broad stereotyping like the one that you are proposing are I think very much misleading and don't bring a lot of value.",
            ">\u00a0to label players in terms of Proactive/reactive, it's more constructive to discuss about what they actually want to play together.\n\nI am confused as to why are you so hell-bent on calling this \"labelling\". My whole point was for people to just take the way they approach games into consideration and just think about whether they are not making life difficult for other players or their DM. I thought I made that clear by trying to offer some advice in the post - and the advice was mostly about \"don't hesitate to talk it through\". Not sure why you turned this into \"labelling\".\n\nMaybe I did not put my thoughts across well.\n\n  \nEdit: Btw was not familiar with a term \"watcher\". I guess that could work if everyone is fine by it.",
            ">I am confused as to why are you so hell-bent on calling this \"labelling\".\n\nBecause it's what you are doing, you are attaching labels to players, and in particular unflattering ones, do you think your passive players would appreciate you telling him \"you are passive\" ?\n\n>think about whether they are not making life difficult for other players or their DM.\n\nThe problem from my perspective is that you are mixing things up. A \"passive\" watcher does not make life difficult for the DM, unless the DM is running a pure sandbox and he has only watchers at his table, for example, whereas a \"proactive\" player might be creating problems for a player running a storyarc and seeing it being derailed constantly by initiatives from that player. But first it's not black and white like this, and second for me the problem is not approaching it from the perspective of being \"proactive\" or \"passive\" (as it can vary from segment of the game to other segments, and it's usually not that strong anyway), but from the perspective of \"Is that player a good fit for what we are trying to play here.\" which is quite a bit more subtle and also less stereotyping of people...",
            ">Because it's what you are doing, you are attaching labels to players, and in particular unflattering ones, do you think your passive players would appreciate you telling him \"you are passive\" ?\n\nOk you just came up with the \"watcher\" label. How is that different? I seriously want you to explain this to me. Your watcher term is more of a label than anything I wrote because I was primarily talking about styles of play.\n\nDid I mention anywhere in the post that you should go out and say \"Hey guys, Jeremy is a reactive player, Julia and tom are proactive players. I want to have two reactive players so one of your will have to switch the style!\" ... because this is how you make it seem with your comments. I seriously don't know what is wrong with you but this \"labelling\" narrative is clearly inbedded in your head and you can't get let it go.\n\n>A \"passive\" watcher does not make life difficult for the DM, unless the DM is running a pure sandbox and he has only watchers at his table,\n\nYou even leveled up the labelling with \"passive watcher\". Well done man.\n\nWhat's funny is that from the very beginning, I added this note in the post: ***PS3:***\u00a0*Obviously I know that most players will encompass both styles of play to some extend so I just simplified it for this post (the two \"reactive\" players of mine also had moments of proactivity which caught me off guard a few times).*\n\nSo I called it out myself that I only wanted to simplify the whole discussion and acknowledged that people cannot be shoehorned into a single \"type\" because it's more complex than that. Yet you seem to have completely missed it.",
            "Actually, I did not come up with it, as I explained, this is an \"official\" label from the D&D 4e rules.
