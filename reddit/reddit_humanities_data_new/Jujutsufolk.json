The whole fight was Sukuna trying to find a way to take down Gojo despite having the 10 Shadows as backup & far more knowledge of Gojo than Gojo had of Sukuna.\n\nSukuna was more experienced & resourceful. Had Gojo been raised in the Heian and/or fought more elite sorcerers, he probably would've won. Sukuna had to pull out every trick he had and put in months of planning to bring him down.\n\nIf anything, it's kind of a reversal on the whole \"protagonist\" point you brought up. Sukuna took down Gojo the way a protagonist would usually take down the antagonist. Sukuna was weaker, and he struggled to find a victory.",

The domain battles were also not in the bag for sukky, otherwise he'd never have gone as far as putting his life at risk to ensure adaptation. And I think we're about to see why...The risk of relying just on domain battles was too high for sukky.\n\n  \nPeople who believe sukky would have easily won are reading Sorcery Fight honestly, not Jujutsu Kaisen.",

That's why he couldn't destroy yuta(gojo) domain now. It especially counters sukuna's open domain.

The heroes in the jjk verse don't really make binding vows like Sukuna. He's at this point is making way too many binding vows.\n\n\nThe cast isn't always correct.
