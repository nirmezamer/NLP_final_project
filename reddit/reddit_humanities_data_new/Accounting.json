With that in mind, for those receiving advice, remember to take recommendations here with a grain of salt as well.\n8. **Do not delete posts, especially submissions under a throwaway**. Once a post is deleted, it can no longer be used as a reference tool for the rest of the community. Part of the benefit of asking questions here is to share the knowledge of others. By deleting posts, you're preventing future subscribers from learning from your thread.\n\nIf you have any questions about the recruiting guide or posting guidelines, please feel free to comment below.",

I had to remove dozens of them today as they began taking over the front page of /r/accounting.\n\nLast year the mod team added the following posting guideline based on feedback we received from the community. We believe this guideline has been successful in maintaining a front page that has a variety of content, while still allowing the community to retain the authority to vote on what kind of content can be found on the front page (and where it is ranked).\n\n__\n\nWe recommend posting follow-up messages/jokes/derivatives in the comment section of the first thread posted. For example - a person posts an image, and you create a similar image with the same template or idea - you should post your derivative of that post in the comment section. If your version requires significantly more effort to create, is very different, or there is a long period of time between the two posts, then it might be reasonable to post it on its own, but as a general guideline please use the comments of the initial thread.\n\n__\n\nThe community coming together over a joke that hits home, or making our own inside jokes, is something that makes this place great. However, it can be frustrating when the variety of content found here disappears temporarily due to something that is easy to duplicate turning into rehashing the same joke on the entire front page of this subreddit.\n\nThe mods have added this guideline as we believe any type of content should be visible on the front page - low effort goofy jokes, or serious detailed discussion, but no type of content should dominate the front page just because it is easy to replicate.",

            "THIS IS SO TRUE.",
            "If I ran a company I\u2019d call it \u201csection 179\u201d it sounds like a CIA Division.\n\nSection 179 in a nutshell is accelerated depreciation where you can depreciate machinery/equipment all at once rather than using a standard MACRS or SL depreciation schedule. Typically used for large cost Items (cost$) as you can only use it once per year at a limit of $1,020,000 (might have an old number there). \n\nSay I buy a piece of equipment to bulldoze for my construction company. It costs $700,000. Typically you\u2019d need to use a MACRS or estimated useful life depreciation etc. and take a tax deduction or say $35,000 per year for a 20 year useful life etc. instead I can elect Section 179 if it\u2019s within the guidelines and take a deduction for the full amount, $700,000. This reduces my tax bill by say $210,000, or whatever my bracket ends up being, and you get access to this capital now to use towards your business/earn a return on capital on versus getting it slowly out of the hands of the government via a slow drip annual depreciation deduction.\n\nThis is in comparison to the \u201cDe Minimus Safe Harbor Rule\u201d which has a similar idea but works for lower cost items at higher volume. You would use this rule for Accelerating Depreciation on say an Apartment Complex that you own with 250 units and each one needs a new oven because of a product defect. If each oven is within the $2500 threshold I believe it is, de minimus safe harbor is your best friend here.\n\nFeel free to add any new info but I think I hit the nail on the head here.",
