It's a work trip so I have stuff going on during the day Tuesday and Wednesday, but I'm staying Thursday in hopes of making some fun memories with my 10 year old. She loves animals so I was thinking the zoo or the aquarium, and I was wondering how much time I should plan to do those. Hoping to fit something in Monday, but we'd be arriving too late for both those options. I was looking into CityPass, and I don't think we'll have time to utilize that, but the C3 Pass may be a good option.  Any recommendations for or against going on the harbor tour? That seems like the one option on there for Monday that fits my schedule. This is my first time planning a vacation on my own, so I'm pretty anxious I'm going to overlook some major details and I'd love some recommendations. Thanks in advance!",

From the maps and memory there's a dog rest point upstairs before the baggage claim, so maybe I can take her there to let her out for a few minutes before queueing. Then assume she will be caged again to queue through immigration?\n\nI tried emailing SeaTac, possibly to no surprise there's no reply after a week.\n\nAnother question, is it ok to bring unopened dog food into US in checked baggage? I keep getting the tsa page which seems to be for domestic.",

The 44 runs between the two quite frequently so if you are close to market street, you can go either way.  The combo of 44+E or 44+D is one of the few situations where I really don't mind having to transfer because the frequency of all 3 is high.  I'm halfway between the D and the E, so I prefer the E because it has fewer stops (none on the bridge stretch, and few on top of queen anne).",

Once we got out downtown every street we walked had tons of speeding cars (we even witnessed a small fender bender).

Plus most people walk on the sidewalks anyway, which means that when you do have to use the sidewalk it's stupidly, annoyingly crowded.\n\nIt wouldn't just be an empty street to walk on if through-traffic was blocked, the entire space would be transformed.

            "The market actually has specific spaces for people doing delivery",
            "To be fair, the food would already be ready and packaged, the OC would just be walking in, grabbing the box, and walking out.",
            "We\u2019re not shopping there though\u2014 we\u2019re literally picking up directly from the businesses. They shouldn\u2019t allow delivery services at all if they don\u2019t want them there.\n\nAnd I should have specified that I was in a designated delivery space\u2014 misspoke by saying \u201cloading zone.\u201d",

There are also the lesser incidents [like this one](https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Seattle-intersection-closed-pedestrian-crash-12879186.php) that don\u2019t always make the news. I just hate the idea that until someone actually dies these incidents aren\u2019t enough for us to think about rethinking things in such an increasingly busy tourist destination.",

            "Delivery service is fine if the delivery is via pedestrian or bicycle.  The volume taken up is at least 50% human.  Delivery service is bad if it's via car.  The volume taken up is at least 80% car.  Yes, the idea would be to remove \"designated delivery spaces\", along with all spaces, other than handicapped spaces and vendor loading zones.",

Hell, the first one didnt start there either. \n\nIf people want to pitch their visions of what Pike Place could be like, they are welcome to do it. Anything in life can be improved. There are a lot of ongoing conversations about this and other forward planning things happening in the market right now. But making the argument that a change is necessary because the status quo is unsafe only works on the internet, because everyone who makes decisions down here knows that its not unsafe. The picture in the post does not show any problems. Its a woonerf, its working fine. \n\nWoonerfs can make people uncomfortable because they mix modes, but that discomfort is not the same as being physically dangerous.",

            "You made a quibble with Carma56 about whether or not Doordash is a \"delivery vehicle\" that would use a loading zone. I was informing you that there are spots specifically marked for services like doordash, and that is likely what Carma56 was talking about. They have since edited their comment and that is what they were talking about. \n\nYou can have ideas about cars and parking or whatever, that person was just sharing their actual experience.",

            "It's your opinion that \"They should be blocked from the market...\", fine whatever.\n\nBut \"Doordashers aren't loading, they're just shoppers like anyone else, except they're shopping on behalf of someone else. \" is not an opinion, its a misunderstanding. Doordashers are considered a distinct group from other shoppers, and the person was speaking to that experience.",
            "I don't care the tiniest bit about that.  The OC began his comment with \"I hear you\".  However, he was not on the same wavelength as the rest of the commenters here.  I don't care if he's on the same wavelength as the current pike place management, because they're dumb as rocks."

Blood was everywhere on my face an in on my windshield. Called the cops and they basically told me theres nothing they can really do cause no license plate or specific things about the person or vehicle.
