            "How long do you want to go away for and do you want to stay over night in fancy motels or basic backpackers hostel or ? Depending on what you want then here are a few suggestions: \n\n1. Train to Geelong, connect with the Vline Great Ocean Road bus that leaves from the bus depot at Geelong Station and travels down the Great Ocean Road. The bus depot is right at the station, you see it as soon as you walk off the platform and out front of the station building. You could hop off the bus and stay at a beachside town along the way right opposite the beach like Lorne or Apollo Bay, both are beautiful with lots to do, huge beach with perfect waves and heaps of food choices. If you go to Lorne, check out the cute seaside cafes next to the Swing bridge and along the beach front and the original renovated cinema along the main street. If you go to Apollo Bay, check out the wharf down at the harbour for great fish and chips overlooking the sea. After Apollo bay the bus continues along the coast on the go past the 12 apostles and all the way to Warnambool. So you can continue on after Apollo Bay on the bus a few days later to stay at Warnambool for a few nights and then take the VLine train home back to Melbourne. \n\n2. I have other suggestions too, like the charming historic towns of Daylesford and Queenscliff, both which can be travelled to via Vline train/bus and each have lots to see and do, lots of food choices and are very beautiful. \n\nDaylesford you get to with the train to Woodend and the connecting bus to Dayleford. Daylesford is a pretty village with lots of colourful autumn trees, cute houses and has an awesome Daylesford lake to walk around and a cool stunning Botanic gardens at the top of the hill on what is an extinct volcano ( there is a cafe at the top), the best hot chicken shop in the main street along with heaps of cafes and interesting shops, Panchos you have to go to and Cliffies cafe around the corner for a local Daylesford institution. Its a small town, so once you arrive there on the bus from Woodend station, you can walk everywhere and everyone is friendly. \n\nQueenscliff you get to with the train to Geelong and the local bus from the Geelong station out to Queenscliff. It is a charming village by the sea with amazing houses, has the main street with lots of interesting shops, maritime museum, the beach near by with lots of coastal walks to the neighbour seaside town of Point Lonsdale which itself is a lovely too and has the lighthouse, cliff top walk and a great little fish and chippery opposite the sea ( a bus connects both these towns too) and there is a wonderful ferry that departs every hour across the bay to Sorrento on the other side. \n\nVictoria is a great place to explore. So many beautiful places to visit. Hope that helps. If you are travelling on your own, my rule is just don't wander about by yourself at night after dark and there are no lights, like anywhere just Stay safe and have fun on your holiday!",

But yeah, not a good party city.\n\n\nFor looking at where to stay, that's tough too. Depends which campus you're mainly studying at. The fact is, nothing is affordable, so hopefully you've got some good scholarships or generous parents. If you're at Clayton, the big campus, I'd try to get on the wait-list for campus housing ASAP, just because then you'll know who you're dealing with.

Yesterday at our local swimming pool some guy went on a continuous rant at her about how everyone hates China while she was trying to relax. I was at work. She ended up complaining to the staff and the guy denied it all. They said he could be banned if he continues to behave that way. I'll go there with her next time anyway just in case.

Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law, the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy.\n\n> The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent any political order (termed the \"state of nature\" by Thomas Hobbes) In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience, assuming that 'nature' precludes mutually beneficial social relationships. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate why rational individuals would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.\n\n> Prominent 17th- and 18th-century theorists of the social contract and natural rights included Hugo de Groot (1625), Thomas Hobbes (1651), Samuel von Pufendorf (1673), John Locke (1689), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762) and Immanuel Kant (1797), each approaching the concept of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had natural rights. Thomas Hobbes famously said that in a \"state of nature\", human life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the \"right to all things\" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape and murder; there would be an endless \"war of all against all\" (bellum omnium contra omnes). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political community (civil society) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary).\n\nffs indeed."
