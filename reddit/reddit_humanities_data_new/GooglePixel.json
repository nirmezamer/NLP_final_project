In a desire to get it out of his hands as quickly as possible, he's offered me the upgrade for $50. Would this be worth it?

Wasn't going to place the order until today afternoon and just noticed that the trade in estimate is now $300. I thought it was an error so added them again in cart but still $300.

I know you're in here, get fucked cynical bitch. This phone lasts me for over a day before I have to charge. My last one lasted 6-8 hours, even when it was new. This phone has all the same stuff as before, but I have 80g's of storage left still. My last phone had 30g remaining even with the same stuff on it. I didn't even have videos on it. \n\nIt has so many little features that OnePlus didn't have. I love it.\n\nI do have one issue. Wtf is up the charge speed? The OnePlus charged in an hour fully. It only lasted for a few hours, but it charged really quick. OnePlus is advertised 30w speed. This phone is advertised as 23w. But when I use a battery app, it shows my phone charging between 2-6w. \n\nWhen I do the troubleshooting charge speed it shows as everything being okay. What am I missing?\n\nThe charger and charging cable I am using are off brand OnePlus Warp chargers (that charged my previous phone fully in an hour). Could that be it? Or is where I plug in the cable messed up, even though the battery settings doesn't detect that?",

I can't find any settings to change the font size. The font size on my phone is not nearly as huge. I [compared](https://imgur.com/a/w5sBNGw) the same email on the gmail and Outlook apps thinking it was just a mobile formatting issue, but no, it's just gmail. Even emails from Google look horrible. I can't even read my emails at this point. Has anyone else had this issue?",

Haven't been tracking the Black Friday sales the past few years, but super quick searches here make me think it's \\_probably\\_ worth waiting?\n\nI don't have a phone to trade in; I'm borrowing my friend's perfectly fine 3a because my 5a went on the fritz.",

She likes bigger phones, which is why I\u2019m considering the 8 Pro, but it seems that the 8A has an upgraded camera (my mom takes a lot of photos). But then again, the 8 Pro also has a telephoto lens which would be good for her photography. \n\nCan anyone speak to the quality of these 2 phones? I also noticed that the 8A only has IP67 whereas the 8 Pro is IP68, but I don\u2019t know how big of a deal that is.",
            "I just got both a Pixel 7 pro and an s23. Please help me decide which one to keep!\n\n\n\nI'll preface by saying I'm absolutely terrible at making decisions. This is just a phone. It doesn't matter in the long run. I get that. With that out of the way, here's my story.\n\nI agonized for weeks over whether to get the pixel 7 pro or the base s23. I ended up going with the pixel since for the same price I got 255gb storage and 12gb ram vs 128/8.\n\nWhen it arrived, I found I was missing a lot of features from my S10. I kept having minor annoyances and this ultimately led to me ordering an s23 with the intent to turn in the pixel.\n\nThe s23 arrived, I booted it up, and now what do I find? I'm missing the pixel. I seem to have adjusted to the annoyances/installed add-ons to help fix them. \n\nThe s23 feels SMALL. I know I'll adjust, but i just like the bigness of the pixel. (funny because that was an initial annoyance)\n\nOne UI feels really cluttered now. I know I can customize it but it feels very overwhelming. Pixel customization was super easy in comparison. \n\nAll in all, now that I'm using s23 I feel like I miss the \"personality\" of the pixel.\n\nI really am struggling determining which phone to keep. I know s23 has better innards, but for whatever reason I feel like I want the pixel. \n\nPlease help!! This will be cross posted to a neutral android sub and Samsung sub to retain an air of non-bias. \n\nThank you",
            "Got a Pixel 8 pro less than 3 weeks ago, 3 nights in a row it had only charged to 70% with adapted charging. I turned it off yesterday and now my phone won't charge at all. I used two different chargers and they both work on my old phone. Any suggestions?",

            "I just bought the 8pro and like it so far. However the haptics are kind of weird. When it's quiet, I can almost hear like a little ping when typing. It's worse with some things, like when closing an app from the recent s menu.\u00a0\n\n\nIs this normal? Do y'all hear a little tiny plink too?

            "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my recent issues with Google Store to warn others and see if anyone has had similar experiences or can advise me on what else I can do.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Ordered four Pixel 8a phones from Google Store.\n* DHL returned the packages to the sender, claiming the address doesn't exist.\n* Google Store claims the packages never returned to them and refuses to refund or resend the phones.\n* DHL refuses to accept a claim because I am not the sender.\n\n**Details:**\n\nIn May 2024, I ordered four Pixel 8a phones from Google Store, each costing 609 EUR. The order details are as follows:\n\n* Order No. GS.5643-9763-4219 (May 16, 2024)\n* Order No. GS.5643-5971-3698 (May 16, 2024)\n* Order No. GS.5643-9898-3836 (May 14, 2024)\n* Order No. GS.5643-5435-7541 (May 14, 2024)\n\nDespite these purchases, the orders were not delivered. According to the tracking status, DHL returned the packages to the sender because the address was supposedly non-existent. However, the packages never made it back to Google.\n\nI contacted Google Store multiple times, asking for confirmation whether the packages were returned and requesting shipment proof, which is necessary for filing a claim with DHL. Here\u2019s a summary of the responses and my interactions with Google Support:\n\n1. **Initial Response:**\u00a0Google Support confirmed that the devices were sent out and returned due to address issues but didn't provide any further assistance or information on the return status of the packages.\n2. **Follow-up:**\u00a0I was repeatedly told to handle the issue with DHL myself, but DHL refused to accept my claim since I am not the sender. I requested proof of shipment from Google multiple times to no avail.\n3. **Higher Tier Support:**\u00a0I eventually reached a higher tier of support, where they reiterated that their decision was final according to their policies and refused to provide any further assistance, documentation, or refund.\n4. **Current Situation:**\u00a0Despite weeks of communication, I still have no proof of shipment or confirmation that the packages were returned to Google. Google refuses to issue a refund or resend the phones.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Google also sent trade-in kits via FedEx, which were delivered to me without any problems.\n* Other packages delivered to me by DHL have arrived without issues, indicating that my address is correct and deliveries are possible.\n\n**Attached:**\n\n* [Screenshots of my order history showing the status of the packages](https://imgur.com/a/Hj3zIJk)\n* [Correspondence with Google Support](https://imgur.com/a/fuXYJrk)\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues with Google Store? Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks",

It's not cracked; the display is just not working. No light being produced at all whatsoever. My phone still can make sound and is responsive to touch. My plan was to fix it with a fix it kit but before I go ahead with spending 100$ on a kit, I thought I'd get outside opinions. There's one thing going on with my phone that has me weary to buy a kit and have it fail: my phone pulses/vibrates in a way I don't think it's supposed to now, it does it rhythmically and it feels like it's a part inside my phone making contact against something it's not while trying to process.

(Even though I'm fairly certain that it was around 80%) But I never got it to come back on. The day before the battery seemed to be draining quicker than normal, but I was in and out of coverage so I figured that was the issue. I did a warranty claim and Verizon sent me a \"new\" (refurbished) P8P and now I'm having issues with this one getting hot to the point I can feel it through the case and the screen has randomly become totally unresponsive ... I really wanted to like this phone after jumping from an iPhone, but I'm starting to regret not getting something like the S23 Ultra. Has anyone else had any issues like this?",

But recently, Ive been thinking of swapping back to the Pixel ecosystem.  I forget which Pixel I had, but I really liked them when I had them.\n\nThe only reason I swapped, was because my charging port started to get messed up, and Verizon had a deal \"trade in your pixel, and get an S22ULTRA for $300.\". And I figured that was too good of a deal, to not get, especially with my last phone dying.\n\nSo I was on this subreddit, and I see a lot of doomer posts about the Pixel.  Has the pixel really gotten that bad?  Is it just not a flagship phone?  Or is it actually bad?\n\nI'm in no rush to replace my phone right now. It's still good enough to use, just kind of annoying sometimes.  Specifically swiping not working/inconsistent, not super responsive occasionally, and the finger print doesn't work very often.\n\nSo in short\n**Is swapping back to the Pixel a bad idea?  Should I wait for the new line of phones?**",

I obliged and requested for the repair to be arranged. I got an email from A1 asking for 850 INR to arrange for the pick up and asked me to make a payment within 3 days or the request will be revoked. I paid up and sent them the recipt. I realized that they tagged my phone as a 7 Pro instead of the plain 7. I dropped the individual another email asking for it to be corrected and also about how I should be ready with my phone. Radio silence for 24 hours then after another follow-up email they told me the device will be picked up in 48-72 hours.\n\nI'm worried about how these guys will handle my phone. I also had an option of getting it repaired at 13K at my doorstep with 6 month warranty @13K but went with Google for an original part.\n\nTLDR: Worried about how Google's service partner will handle my phone",

I don't know how much, if anything, that means in practice.\n\n* Slightly worse battery life.\n\nThe 8a is far superior to the 5a in the following ways:\n\n* Twice the storage space (but sadly only for the obsidian color).\n\n* Amazing camera. The 5a had a very good camera, but the 8a is fantastic. I just wish it had a real telephoto lens.\n\n* So much faster. When I took a picture with the 5a while listening to a podcast, the podcast with pause for a fraction of a second. On the 8a, everything just works.\n\nI haven't had any issues with my mobile connection, like dropped calls or anything like that. My 5a ran hotter than my 8a. That's been a complete non-issue with the 8a. The ambient (i.e. black) screen cannot be unlocked by swiping up, but the lock screen can. I've just trained to always press on the finger print icon, whether it is locked or unlocked. I haven't tried face recognition yet, I might try that next.",

            "Also the 8 Pro is now $250 off and trade in values are up, my Pixel 7 is a $330 credit. I just pulled the trigger on this upgrade not only from the standard line to the pro line, but also up a generation and also spent the extra $60 to go from 128GB to 256GB even though I personally don't really need it (but it'll be nice to have and it should help the trade in value down the line).",

The amount you will get on a trade in will continue to go down over time (unless someone wants to give you more funds than your device would technically be worth on the open market).    \n\nHow much longer will Depends on how much longer you want to use your 6a, how much you could get for it.  And how expensive your next advice will be costing you.   \n\nIMHO, I would keep the Pixel 6a until the security updates stop or the battery life of the Pixel 6a causes me issues in my regular life and I have to charge my phone more often than I want to do.  \n\nIf you can wait until Pixel 9 that would be good, if you can wait until the Pixel 10 that would be a much bigger improvement from your Pixel 6a.",

The Google app has used less than 1%, so that seems very odd.",

Half the time I plug the dang thing in it goes into this \"Connect/disconnect\" loop that drains the battery faster so I literally cannot charge my phone, which is a bigger problem than fast battery draining imo. \n\nI get that you need chargers of a certain quality and wattage to reliably charge, but that's not it. I also confirmed the cords, ports on the wall bricks, and port on my phone are clean. I have a cover for the port too, so that's also not it. \n\nStill. My 7 pro has been throwing fits randomly about high-quality Anker power supplies with good quality cords and all I find are similar complaints with no answer that worked for my phone. IDK what the issue is with this phone. \n\nI just want to be able to charge and unlock my phone without jumping through weird hoops. It's wild to me that it seems so difficult for Google to provide reliability with such foundational features. That's crap I expect from a cheap knock-off, not from a flagship product of one of the biggest brands in the business.",

            "Thanks for the suggestion. However, the issue in this situation is the trade-in program used, where sent several of my phones to them. The money is sent as a refund to the order transaction, so the bank will likely only refund the remaining amount, and won't get my phones back.",

It defies facts, reality, and practicality.\n\nActually it's the opposite--the higher charge to which a battery is charged to (i.e. percentage of capacity), there is proportionately more wear experienced.  It's real and it's quantifiable and both lithium-ion and lithium-polymer battery technology suffers from this.  Meaning there is proportionately more wear experienced by the battery charging the top 20% from 80-100% than there is experienced charging to the previous 20% increment from 60-80%.\n\nThis says nothing of the practical impact--I have no recent quantitative data to justify one way or another, but what I can say is that my wife always left her pixel 3 plugged in over night and the phone lasted a good 4-5 years with no battery issues.  So whatever the savings in wear there may have been in limiting charge to 80%, it probably would not have made a bit of difference either way for her (arguably) very normal  and typical use case.\n\nEdit, for people who don't understand, percent battery charge is the voltage capacity that the battery is charged to.  Charging to a higher voltage (% charge) reduces the life:\n\n>Most Li-ions charge to 4.20V/cell, and every reduction in peak charge voltage of 0.10V/cell is said to double the cycle life. For example, a lithium-ion cell charged to 4.20V/cell typically delivers 300\u2013500 cycles. If charged to only 4.10V/cell, the life can be prolonged to 600\u20131,000 cycles; 4.0V/cell should deliver 1,200\u20132,000 and 3.90V/cell should provide 2,400\u20134,000 cycles.\n\nhttps://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries#:~:text=Lithium%2Dion%20suffers%20from%20stress,function%20of%20temperature%20and%20SoC.",

Tech has improved a lot though and since heat is the biggest factor of battery failure you want to ideally avoid charging as much as possible. \n\nMaybe it could prolong the life a little on devices like iPhones that generally do well in the battery department and have great efficiency, but compare that to pixels where the batteries are quite poor especially with data and GPS running, keeping those at 80% will just cause the device to drain low faster when it isn't on charge, requiring more charges and damaging the battery that way. \n\nIf I limited to 80% I'd have to do a top up during the day most likely, but I can pretty much get through the day and evening from a full battery, barring I've not been travelling and using something like maps all day. I don't plan or generally keep my devices over 3 years, so the extra 20% a day far outweighs the miniscule health I might save from limiting it everyday. \n\nThere's always posts on Xitter that's like \"show me your iPhone battery health\" since it's been out for a while, and you can read someone will be meticulous with doing the 20-80, and someone who says they just charge when they need and don't care, and the one who doesn't care will have a higher % of health according to the device, imo it's completely random and depends on the health of the battery to begin with.",

Was I being unfair to Apple and doing a disservice to myself by not giving its ecosystem a chance? \n\nLast fall I jumped into Apple with a 15 Pro, Series 7 watch, Airpods Pro 2, Tablet Mini 6th Gen, and MacBook Air M1. What I found: it wasn't the totally seamless experience I heard about and expected. It was not the bug-free utopia I imagined. Everything took extra steps over what I'm used to. I don't feel like typing out all the little things I missed on Android but long story short, I did not enjoy my experience so all my Apple stuff is gone after 6 months. I'm now even more fully convinced of how much I appreciate Android and Pixel in particular, combined with yes even the dreaded Windows - if anything after 30 years I'm welded to Windows for better or worse. \n\nBut I suggest no one take my experience as their own. Get an iPhone and jump into Apple. Maybe you'll love it and not turn back. Or maybe like me you'll find the grass is definitely not greener. Tech is just a tool and no one should be loyal to any tech company.\n\nEdit: the one thing I miss most from Apple is the Airpods Pro 2. They sound so much better than Pixel Buds Pro so I'm really hoping we get a Buds Pro 2 with improved sound this year. And if I'm dreaming go back to the wing design so they actually stay in.

But only because I had about \u00a350 Google credit and using the educators discount YouTube premium its \u00a37.99 a month... \n\nI'm not sure other than no ads I see the benefits of YT Premium. I prefer Tidal for music tbh, the quality is a lot better.",
            "Yes once used to universal back gesture for a couple years, it is very difficult to go without it. Even after 6 months on the iPhone I was still swiping out of habit and it drove me mad",
            "I am fed up with the amount of bugs I notice on a daily basis. \n\nThe AI features were the only reason I was still around. But now that apple has woken up, they will likely invest more into AI and there isn't really a justifiable reason for using a buggy phone anymore. \n\nThat being said, this is because I'm fortunately in a situation of privilege where I can afford to drop $1500+ on the new pro phone + watch. If price would have been a concern, I might have stuck around.",
            "I guess I'm lucky as I haven't really experienced any bugs with my pixel products. The Google home ones I found more buggy but those seem to have improved a lot recently for me. \n\nThe thought of starting again on a new platform does kinda leave me cold though. So I think that alone would keep me in an ecosystem."
