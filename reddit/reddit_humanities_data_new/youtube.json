So he started pumping dark memes and songs out about racism, sexism and even hitler. he got a ton of hate for it and he stopped making the dark humour, but the damage was done. He became a content farm, posting unfunny cheap ass memes every hour. Until June 20, 2024. All his accounts were terminated, exept one: his music channel, \u2018young oogway\u2019 This is where he would post his stupid unfunny memes, until he changed his channel  name to bubbi memes. In his comments, he\u2019s telling fans stuff like \u201cI\u2019m not oogway im bubbi memes\u201d with bad spelling, almost as if a kid wrote it. This is how the story is so far.",
