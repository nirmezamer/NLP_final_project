I have uninsured motorist coverage, so my insurance company is going to cover everything minus a $250 deposit. Car max brought their online offer down to $11k after making an initial $13k online offer (hail damage, tear in the flooring, etc). Statefarm just confirmed with me they are going to be sending me a $15k check. So yeah, what was initially awful turned out for the best for me. I'll take what rare car luck I can get",

            "I have AAA Car insurance and mine is still covered with no issues. My rate is a good rate. That is one of the reasons why I am trading in the car because I can not risk AAA dumping me one day or the car getting stolen. I had no idea that Kia and Hyundai did this to millions of people. They said that they built their cars like this same as in Korea because cars do not get stolen in Korea. I read this on many forums about this. Either way, I can't wait until my car comes in next month. I need to dump my current car.",

            "If states would make car theft a violent offense punishable as if it were aggravated assault there would be less of this stuff. If states would automatically make car thieves, regardless of age, prosecutable as adults, there would be less of this stuff.\n\nCar theft can destroy a victim's life by denying use of transportation for everyday purposes. It causes mental anguish and can result in traumatic stress for some people.\n\nCar thieves are some of the worst yet most lightly punished criminals in our systems.",

            "The fucking stupidity rate in your country is just fucking astonishing to somebody living in a first world european country. It's mindboggling to me how fucking dumb, like what an actual fucking moron would you have to be, to steal somebody's property, usually somewhat expensive, and then post proof of your crime on fucking tiktok. \n\nLike what an actual fucking cretin would do that? I really, trully hope, that these kids have their entire futures ruined. I'm talking fucking poverty for the rest of their lives, no comeback. That kind of stupidity is just astounding...\n\nIt is kind of funny though seeing as Europe has laws requireing immobilizers in pretty much all of the cars sold :DDD",
            "My car has been stolen for the 2nd time in 2 months cause of this bullshit. Just owning this car has cost me $1000 between the 2 insurance deductibles I have to pay to get my car fixed after it was found, this time around they stole everything from inside, even my registration from the glove box..\n\nIm selling my elantra as soon as its repaired, and personally Hyundai has lost my business for life.",

            "Is there somewhere a list of insurers that also refuse these models?\n\nI looked at Geico's website, but I do not see a list of ineligible models.\n\nLooking at a 2020 Hyundai, but not going to dip if it's not going to get insured.

            "Push-to-start systems are not without risks either, actually. If you keep your fob/remote anywhere near your exterior walls and you don't live in a hardened bunker someone with the right tools can activate and sniff out the authorization key or whatever from it, clone it, and use it to operate your car like they owned it.\n\nThe main difference is that rando kids off the street are less likely to own or know where to get the kit.",
            "My understanding is that all cars with a mechanical turn key ignition are without an immobilizer. So, this could affect a lot more cars than just the Kias and Hyundais, it is just that those are the make/models being discussed among thieves on tiktok.  \n\n\nI really don't understand the Kia and Hyundai hate here. These cars were on the roads for over a decade without any particular theft issues. If you want to talk about the cause of this problem, surely you have to also try to explain the timing.",
            "Can anyone confirm the older Ioniq Hybrids are NOT vulnerable to this \"attack\"? I'm thinking of buying one.",
            "Have they issued any recall at all?",

            "I don\u2019t understand.  State Farm won\u2019t provide insurance for the vehicles listed above? Why? Do other insurances cover these vehicles? If so, are premiums higher? Is it a safety issue?",

            "In Asian countries like Korea and Japan.  Car theft doesn't even exist on the radar of the police.  That's why immobilizer wasn't a big thing there.  It took a long decade for Japanese car makers to realize how important it is to make the immobilizer on the engine, vin# etched, and car parts more difficult to swap in order to stop car theft overseas.  Car radios, headlights, even door cards and steering wheels had to be made more difficult to take off in order to prevent thefts.  These type of car part thefts doesn't exist in Asia and not prioritized.",

            "Lies continuing to spread\u2026 Hi I recently bought a 2017 Hyundai Sonata. Guess what? I have insurance. With whom you might ask? State Farm. \n\nMakes me think the people who spread these lies are the ones driving without insurance because a simple question to your insurance agent could avoid you spreading bs like this.",

            "This whole situation has been crazy!! I had a 2020 Hyundai Elantra SEL, bought it brand new in 2020 and it was stolen in February. They just found it last week and deemed it a total loss because they damaged the back bumper, smoked in the car so bad that it stinks, messed up the ignition, and messed up the seats. It makes me so sad because I bought the car when the interest rates were still good and it was almost paid off. On top of that, I was at 43k when they stole the car and I never had an issue with the car. My car had the security update. \n\nI got some money back for it after the total loss, so now I\u2019m looking into a new car.

I get pissed because I had a 2008 Honda Civic that I paid off and my abusive ex destroyed it and so I sold it for cheap because I hated looking at it and it had been in really good shape for one of those before he came in the picture and every time I see one of the same body style around town they are trashed and have the hubcaps/steelies, I had the real factory Enkei wheels on mine....\n\n---\n\nAfter I left my abuser, my coworker was trying to help me because she was interested in buying a new car. She sold me her 2015 Kia Sportage and I figured it would be OK since she felt safe hauling her kids in it and her husband is a mechanic who kept up with the maintenance. I am glad I went through an insurance broker because I found out after I bought it that most major Insurance carriers wouldn't insure it, and he found me a random ass mom and pop that would. And 2 weeks after I bought it the engine went out!!!!! And insurance only pays for a rental after a car accident. So I had to pay out of pocket for a rental I couldn't afford and borrow money from family. And the dealership was a headache to deal with. My coworker felt really bad because she genuinely had been trying to help me.\n\n\n---",

So for all those models/years listed - if your car turns on with a key, it's trivial to start it without the key and drive away.  Someone just needs to break the plastic part and turn it, and a standard USB stick happens to be just the right size to do it.  (it has nothing to do with the USB stick electrically connecting to the car or data, it's just the right size).\n\nHyundai/Kia thefts have gone up exponentially in some areas of the country as this flaw became more widely known, and now some insurance companies are dropping their coverage for the cars.  Hyundai/Kia do have a fix to try and prevent this, but it's a  bit of a kludge and comes with its own issues.

I've taken it on so many road trips ( \\~ 8 to 12 hour drives ) branching out from my home. The ONLY issue I have had is the brakes that came with the car get really bumpy because the pads deposit brake material on rotor over short time period -- the type of pad they used just sucks and this is a common complaint amongst Stinger owners (this happened with less than 8k miles and average braking and city driving). Solution was to get the stinger gt pads sold in Europe or the Hyundai Genesis pads sold here in America.\n\nBesides the above issue, nothing else whatsoever. I keep up with consistent oil changes and tire rotations. The engine does tick a bit loudly but like most modern engines are this way. I'm sure there's something to address this once I hit the 60k mile maintenance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\nMy driving habits:Every time I take it out I make sure to let it warm up, then open it up full throttle open for a good 5 seconds on the highway to let the injectors get clean as it can from fuel washing around the injection points. ( I do this anyways because of my ocd, I'd guess not everyone really wants to worry about it but when you have a turbo and other mechanical components you need to take care of them especially when you have a manufacturer like Kia/Hyundai and quality of parts can be an issue - though I've not noticed anything negative on my stinger)\n\nAfter done having fun, chill out, put it in comfort let the turbo's cooldown with cool driving, then eco mode for the remainder of the drive.

            "TL;DR I would avoid this car unless you know you will only ever charge at home and at work. It is rapidly becoming obsolete. Unlike most other electric cars today it will never be able to use the Tesla supercharger network or any of the other big charging networks like Electrify America.\n\nIf you want it, here\u2019s the detailed explanation.\n\nAs far as I know it\u2019s a pretty good car. People who own them seem to like them and I see old ones all the time so it\u2019s probably decently reliable.\n\nIt has one major flaw. It uses an outdated fast charging standard.\n\nBasically every electric car out there uses the CCS charger (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Charging_System) or Tesla\u2019s charger, now called \u201cNACS\u201d. However, Nissan started making the Leaf before those standards were set, so the Leaf has always used the CHAdeMO fast charger  (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAdeMO).\n\nWhat does this mean practically? Well when you see people plug in their Tesla or Chevy Bolt or whatever at home or a hotel they are probably using a J1772 AC charger. The Leaf does have this!You can charge it at home the same way you would any other EV. However! If you are doing a road trip, the Nissan Leaf cannot use Tesla superchargers and it cannot use any standard EV. It has to use a CHAdeMO charger for fast charging, and those are probably going to stop being maintained eventually since no other car uses it.\n\nIf you want an analogy to fossil fuel think about it this way. Tesla basically runs on diesel, which is sold everywhere and other EVs run on gas which is sold everywhere. Nissan Leafs basically run on coal. You can buy coal and fill it up at home, but you won\u2019t guarantee that if you take a road trip you\u2019ll find a place that sells coal. So road trips are out.\n\nIf you are interested in EVs I recommend this video to get a handle on stuff like charging standards https://youtu.be/Iyp_X3mwE1w?si=BNLvCCKbG7INt2rQ",
            "Nissan engineer here. Super simple answer that most people have missed. \n\nThat car is end of life, it is not made anymore. The new model to replace it is due \u201csoon\u201d. \n\nThey are selling off very old inventory to make space for the new influx of the new model.",
            "Our Nissan Leaf has been driven for 11 years without a single issue. It\u2019s honestly the most under rated car out there. Granted, it excels at commute and driving around town only.",
            "It's a small car, has a small range, slow charging.  Not very quick, not a lot of redeeming qualities. But if you're just using it to and from work it'll be a good car.  But as a primary vehicle absolutely.not.\n\nI'd do a nice long test drive to see if it's comfy enough for you.",
            "Some dealerships include the government ev subsidy as part of the price. It's possible that's why it appears so cheap.",
            "They don\u2019t usually offer discounts on good cars that are in high demand",
            "It\u2019ll get you to and from work. If I recall correctly, the battery doesn\u2019t have thermal management, so range will be affected by extreme temperatures. Overall, it\u2019s not great but probably better than any other $11k car out there. Look up tax rebates on used EV\u2019s.",
            "Loved mine when I had it. Nothing broke. Ever. It's real practical with fold down seats and a high roof. Range was my issue. Any Nissan dealer has free charging and I charged overnight at home but.. it's a range thing.",
            "Had one and got rid of it. Everything below are the reasons why. CHAdeMO charging, no thermal management, the motor design isn't modern and sit in the \"frunk\" taking up all the space much like an ICE car. The tech inside is quite dated. It was reliable and I have no complaints about it, but if you are looking to buy an EV.. get one with NACS or CCS charging. NACS being the easy way as you just pull up to the charger, plug it in.. and wait. It bills to your account based on the VIN of the car.",
            "Small battery, small car.",
            "It's an older model with a halfass interior refresh, not worth asking price these days. That discount is definitely baked in.",
            "It sucks.",
            "Because they grow on trees.",
            "Very interesting answer, good to know!",
            "Spot on. My mechanic drives a Leaf and he's like \"it's actually pretty dead reliable, it's fantastic for groceries and getting to work, and, most importantly, I have another car if I ever need to leave the city\"",
            "Is the new model going to use the more standard charger as someone above commented? And will it have a better range?",
            "How could you be happy in a car like this? You probably haven't won a single drag race in 11 years",
            "We have a MK1 Leaf as the local runaround. My wife does 2-3k local miles a year, it's ideal for that.\n\nWe have a 7kW charger at home that can fill it 0-100% in a few hours, it'll do 85 miles to a charge, and it's surprisingly spacious for a hatchback due to the long wheelbase.\n\nBut trying to go anywhere more than 35 miles from home without a plan for where it can be plugged in leads to range anxiety.\n\nChademo is luckily quite common in the UK though, even newer CCS sites regularly have a few 50kW Chademo machines too.",
            "I think you're right",
            "Ah that explains it, initially i was looking at the 22' fit which was listed for 18k/22k miles but it was already sold. Now he called me days later offering me an alternative option which was the leaf.",
            "Yeah from what I can tell, besides some battery cooling issues in the first few years the Leaf was a very reliable, quality vehicle.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda too bad about the charging thing because people do seem happy with them",
            "You paying cash or financing? If you\u2019re financing go get a new Toyota, Subaru or Mazda for a better rate.",
            "Yeah. Japan has mainly CHADEMO chargers, they are everywhere, so I don\u2019t think Nissan will change the standard anytime soon.",
            "They\u2019ll just fit the best charging port for the location like Tesla do. EU cars get CCS, and USA get NACS, Japanese cars can get Chademo.",
            "It\u2019s probably a budget thing, I\u2019d assume. It\u2019s not a matter of just putting a different plug. Otherwise they would do it long time ago."

            "You ever see one of those Lincoln commercials, with Matthew McConaughey? It\u2019s just like that. \n\nIn reality it will depend entirely on what you drive, where you\u2019re going, and how you drive there.",
            "I think it depends on the brand and the trim level and model.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm going to take a lot of shit for this from people who have never owned one of these vehicles who think they know everything. But I'm going to say it anyway.....\n\n\nWe've had most recently a 2020 GLS 580, and prior to that a 2017 GLS 450. And while the C-Class, if optioned up nicely feels premium, most of those models are $499/mo stripper lease specials and don't feel special. And don't get me going about the gla/b, cla class Mercs, or the other entry level cars from both BMW and Mercedes (we also have a current gen 540 xDrive and x5m50i, so we have experience with the entry level loaner cars when they go in for service or maintenance). We also have a Jaguar f pace s, so I'm speaking from direct firsthand experience of at least 2.5 years with ea h of tbese vehicles, and having recently traded in the GLS580.\n\n\nYou're going to get a lot of feedback here from people who brought the cheapest luxury brand model they could, for about something that's a decade old because that's all they could afford, which probably isn't a good decision in the first place, and are going to tell you how special they feel because they're driving around a No option Car with a European badge on the front...... Those cars aren't special.\n\n\nSo when you get to the higher level models there is something different. There's a level of refinement in the suspension and the tactile feel of the Interior components that tend not to be replicated on even the high-end mainstream brands. There tends to be a bit more feel, yet at the same time a bit more isolation from Road imperfections than on a more mainstream brand vehicle.\n\n\nThe best way to try to explain it is to actually test drive one of these vehicles yourself. You'll see that there is a difference. I'm not saying that the top trim models from mainstream brands are very refined and they do Luxury very well, but there are certain tactile Sensations that you have to experience to truly understand the difference between say a top trim Grand Islander or whatever the lexus version is, and something like a GLS 450.\n\n\nAnd also has a point of reference, we also have an MDX type S advance, and while that's a $75,000 car, and it has fantastic luxury features and decent performance, it doesn't have the same overall level of refinement as any of our European vehicles in that price range have, even though it's a phenomenal vehicle itself and I highly recommend it to anybody.\n\n\nBut the most important thing here is to never buy a car you can't comfortably afford. You should always own your car, your car should never own you, as you've correctly pointed out. The worst decision you can make is to spend all your money on a car to show off to strangers, while you're still living in your parents' basement.\n\n\nSo I know I'm going to get crucified for this post but there is a difference, it's hard to quantify, but you know it when you've experienced it.",
            "I'm used to driving normie vehicles - my daily is a 2010 Mazda3 hatchback, and my family vehicle is a 2022 Kia Carnival. I drove a luxury car for the first time on vacation in Germany last year - a basically brand new 2024 520d wagon. I put about 1000km on it in four days - here are my observations:\n\n* Shockingly quiet cabin. This has huge additional benefits - the sound system sounds better because it isn't fighting with road/wind noise, so you can keep it quieter and still hear all the detail in your music. You can hold conversations at normal conversation volume. There's less fatigue after a long ride.\n* Extraordinary seat comfort, further enhanced by the smooth suspension over the frankly incredible German road system.\n* Every touch point is well padded - even where my knees knock against the center console.\n* My wife was able to sleep in this vehicle. She can't sleep in cars - and she was asleep as I bounced against the engine governor at 225kmh on the Autobahn. I can't think of higher praise for a vehicle.\n* Everything that needed to be done was effortless - once I got Android Auto configured. The navigation system barking German directions at me wasn't great lmfao. The HUD's integration with Android Auto in particular is excellent.\n* As a large wagon, it's just enormous. No shortage of leg room or cargo space. It was WAY more car than I needed for two people and four days.\n\nComing home to my Mazda 3 just about broke me. I do 20-25k miles/year, and to go back to a 15 year old Mazda 3 was upsetting to say the least.\n\nIf you can afford to drive one, I think you're doing yourself a disservice to *not* drive a German luxury vehicle. It's well worth the maintenance, insurance, gas, and sticker price imo.",
            "I've owned and driven lots of cars over the years: Toyota, Honda, VW, Acura, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Mazda, Lexus, Audi, etc.   Having commuted & done road trips in most of them, now that I'm well into my 30s I find the quiet comfort of a luxury brand is well worth the price of admission (& maintenance). \n\nDespite both of my Audis being a decade old, they're still more comfortable and capable than any other car I've had yet. As parents of multiple kids & dog-owners, we're planning on getting a minivan for our next car - but definitely plan to keep one of the Audis for the overall balance of comfort, practicality, and fun driving experience.",
            "Luxury cars and brands definitely put a lot more emphasis into getting the core basics right. The NVH, ride and refinement are usually better here than on mass market brands.\n\nTake the Rav4 and NX. They are built in the same platform and sometimes in the same facility, but there's no question the Lexus is far more refined than the Toyota and on a longer drive you come out feel more relaxed and less tired. \n\nI've recently taken a new CX-90, one of Mazda's newest and finest (and Mazda being a darling on this sub), on a longer road trip with the family in our annual outing. Despite it being bigger and fancier than the base Mercedes GLC 300 we taken last year, everyone including my sister all complained the Mazda felt like a downgrade once we begin to rack up the kms.\n\nThe Mazda had the initial quality and materials use that can match the Mercedes, but it soon becomes clear even to the non-car people that luxury brands do have selling points outside of cache.",

So I say go for it! I also consider myself a car guy, and bought my first new car a few years ago. I needed a nudge from friends to do it. I didn't make the jump to a true luxury brand, but got the top-end fully-loaded model of a \"normie\" brand (doing such appealed to my frugal side!). And I love it. I take great care of the car, and yeah -- sometimes I do take it for-granted, but whenever I stop to appreciate it, I REALLY appreciate it, since for me this isn't just a car....it's partially the realization of a life goal, and it really does make for a more pleasant commute than the (also nice, but much older) car it replaced.\n\nBeing frugal doesn't have to mean never spending money -- it can also mean making sure that when you do splurge, you do it on something that has high worth to you.\n\nYou'll notice I didn't mention any specific car brands or models...because in the end I think your question is ultimately more about the mindset and thought process about this purchase and ownership experience than the exact car itself.",

The manual shifter feels crunchier, the car is more tossable and Lively, the suspension is harder and more rigid, etc.\n\nNo it does not change you and make you a snob, the difference isn\u2019t so big you\u2019ll refuse all economy cars for good haha. The effect will wear off, like all things.",
            "I'm by now means experienced, but going from my mom's 2019 chevy equinox to my current car, a 2013 audi q5, was a very large jump.\n\nThe car was also recently in the body shop cuz a lady rear ended me, and I got a free rental in the meantime. The rental was a 2018 buick encore.\n\nGoing back to me audi which is 5 years older than that \"luxury compact suv\" was another insane jump.\n\nYou absolutely will notice the difference from other cars, but of course over time you will get used to it. \n\nBut if you really like the csr itself like me, you will never get sick of it. I've had it for a year now, put 12k miles on it, and I can't get enough of it. It is very, very comfortable, and especially after getting a tune for it (put it upto 420ish hp, it's the supercharged 3.0t), if is beyond fun to drive. \n\nThough that last part isn't exclusive to luxury vehicles",
            "It depends on what you like. Luxury is isolating, Nice for a passenger but as a driver I tend to not like it very much. The quiet and numbness interferes with my situational awareness and feel for the car. I am a bit more of a driving enthusiast and like feeling the texture of the road through the wheel and seat and how the tires stretch at the edge of traction etc.\n\nI used to get driven to work in a Bentley Continental R and it was super quiet and isolating. You can hear a lot more of what's going on inside the cabin, like the fabric of clothes rubbing when people move around and weird things like that. I do quite like BMW's which are a good compromise and still a driver-oriented car. I really want an older Lotus though, light, nimble, small engine but high power to weight ratio and no power steering.",
            "my tip for buying cars is to never buy more than your means.... not just because of sheer financial burden, but you get more attached to your vehicle & obsess about dents, scratches, wheel scrapes etc. It's harder to enjoy your ride when you feel like it's a garage queen and needs to be handled with white gloves.",

It\u2019s been paid off for a couple of years and I think, if you enjoy driving and you like cars, that it significantly improves your life. Especially if you drive a lot.

            "Buying a car really depends on your reasons. If you're purchasing just for the badge, the excitement might wear off quickly, leaving you wanting something newer or better. For instance, I wouldn't buy an older Porsche Boxster simply because it's a Porsche. But if status is important is importantly for the foolish eye, then go for it. There are way better ways to spend your money.\u00a0\n\nTake BMWs, for example. German cars often have those premium touches\u2014like the satisfying sound and smooth action of their windows. However, there's a big difference between a base model and an M series. If you think a base BMW is impressive, there are other cars that might offer more value for your money. The M series, on the other hand, is designed for driving enthusiasts and track use.\n\nIn the end, it's all about priorities. If buying a certain car makes you happy and you're doing it for yourself, then that's what matters most.\u00a0",

The 7 series, S class, x7, LS, LX; etc, is VERY different from a base stripped out 3 series / c-class.\n\n\nNow is it worth the extra expense ? That depends on who you ask. I still use a Toyota for my work vehicle, but I daily a very expensive BMW. If you spend a lot of time on your car, I would get something on the nicer end. \n\nIf I only had one car, I would get a fully loaded Lexus LS or LX.",

It\u2019s not even way up there in luxury world, but especially for the non-sporty one, the quiet, the insanely smooth ride quality, the fabulous sound system, and the most comfortable seats I own all make it very good as an experience. And it\u2019s super safe to boot.\n\nBoth the 5-cylinder and straight 6 give ample power and you never feel like you\u2019re struggling. The 6 is faster than most modern American \u201cmuscle\u201d cars.\n\nThe difference for me is, in previous cars I\u2019ve had which have been more middling or economical (I\u2019m mostly a frugal person but I have decided to allow myself nice cars), the question of \u201cshould I take the scenic route?\u201d was an open one worthy of debate. If I did, I might end up being super tired and beat up at the end of the day. These cars make the scenic route an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nBUT when work needs to be done, I feel it in the wallet.\n\nIf you do enough research you can get a decent used luxury vehicle at a good price, but be careful of reliability and ownership cost pitfalls, and definitely test drive a bunch first. Some \u201cluxury\u201d cars don\u2019t even feel that great. I test drove an Acura TLX and rented an Audi Q3 once and both of them drove like economy cars.",

Once you get an expensive car, there\u2019s a ton of things to worry about. Bird pooped on your paint? Better wash it off before it eats into your clear coat. Parked next to a water sprinkler? Those water spots will etch into the clear coat. Can\u2019t park near the entrance anymore, some inconsiderate person will ding it up.",
            "It depends on the person obviously, but at least in my experience it also depends on the car. I have driven a *lot* of BMWs over the years that did not give me any kind of nice feeling. Sure they're a little nicer to be in than a Toyota or a Ford or something, but it's hard for me to get excited about getting behind the wheel of a SUV or a base model sedan. However, when I climb into my M2, or the M8 I recently had as a loaner, they truly feel special. It's the performance sure, but it's also the sound, the feel of carbon fiber, alcantara, leather. \n\nFor me at least, that feeling never goes away... but I also don't get it in the first place in many of the BMWs I've driven. But as I said, everybody is different. Some people love their luxury SUVs and would find my orange M2 vulgar, uncomfortable, and impractical.",

My first car I bought myself was a used Mustang (which to others point I could easily afford), but it was still probably 10k more than something bare minimum which has been absolutely worth it.  Starting the car still puts a smile on my face 8 years later.  As far as luxury cars it depends how much you value build quality, especially interior.

Yea it will cost me more over its life but I honestly don't care and will never go back to a non luxury car.\n\nEdit just to add, we specifically waited until the cost of ownership was immaterial, like it doesn't matter to me that tires will cost $1800 to keep perellis on it, or that it's a more expensive brake job etc. we also went the gently used CPO route, avoided the bulk of initial deprecation and picked it up much cheaper than if we had gone new so not only was the cost immaterial but I feel like we got a good deal. It did take me nearly a year to find exactly what I was looking for tho so it's not like we popped out one weekend and picked it up had to wait for the right one to hit the market.\n\nI don't think I'll ever get my wife out of Audi SUV's.

I slammed it on Godspeed coilovers and put on a new intake along with flowmaster headers and exhaust.\n\nIt handles well for a 3500lb car but the use case is kind of ruined since every performance modification I make goes directly against the design philosophy of the vehicle.\n\nAll that aside, there are features that I enjoy a lot, like auto climate control and heated seats which I will miss a little when I switch back to a non-luxury vehicle, but my favourite part of the car is just how everything is built to last with an unusual precision. All of the mechanical bits of the interior still function exactly as they would have when it comes off the lot 21 years ago, and the steering rack has relatively tight tolerances and decent feel, contrary to the relative numbness of the rest of the car stock.

It has some of the same quirks that all my other cars have had (this includes Toyota and Honda). Just today i went to drive to the office and when i unlocked my door it was unresponsive.  I had to keep clicking unlock on the key fob for about 30 seconds to get it to work. However, once inside it was very nice to drive.",
            "I drive a mustang gt premium. Now it's nice, it has all of the generic \"luxery\" things  but it's still a ford. Not a true luxery car. Now my friend recently bought a newer amg g63. Now that is luxery. You won't touch anything in that car that doesn't feel like money. Somehow it's able to do all types of driving perfectly. He paid 4X what I paid for my mustang. So that's a big problem. But. If I ever get seriously rich, I'm 100% getting a real luxery car. It's worth just experiencing one. I can't even imagine how elite luxery must be like Maybach, rolls royce, ect.",

            "I owned a Hyundai Equus for about a year, and the biggest differences between \u201cnormal\u201d cars and luxury cars is how easily they eat up longer drives and the sound insulation. \n\nLess road and wind noise means better (at least perceived) sound system quality, less noise when going over potholes and bumps which helps perceived ride quality, and when driving at highway speeds the lower wind noise (and generally higher curb weight) means you and the car feel more planted and less twitchy/frantic going 80+/130+ mph/kmh.\n\nPiggybacking off that last point, no cars eat highway miles like luxury cars do. The cruise controls are better calibrated, everything about the ride is more comfortable, the steering is lighter, etc etc. Cruising at highway speeds is a positively relaxing experience in a luxury vehicle.\n\nObviously materials are nicer and the engine/transmission are better calibrated than mass produced vehicles which helps NVH, but to me those are the more superficial things. It\u2019s the whole experience that sets this class of vehicles apart.",

So I now have an asset that I worry about. I'm also used to spending little to nothing on maintenance. If I start getting $2-4k repair bills in a few years, I will develop buyers remorse really quickly. $2k saved & invested now will probably be worth $20k when I retire. \n\nMy fuel economy is atrocious, given the way I drive, but also I drive <5k miles per year so the fuel cost is not material to me. \n\nWhat I can't say at the moment is if this will be the type of vehicle I will continue to own for many years or it's just a one-off and in 5 years, I'll return to a reliable Japanese product (which could include a Toyota Landcruiser or Lexus GX550)...",

It\u2019s a very subtly-controlled car; unlike other cars I\u2019ve owned. Learning how it responds to a slight touch of the accelerator, brake, steering\u2014it feels like dancing with someone.\n\nThe more you dance, the better the flow. Eventually you feel like you and the car are one. Any good car will do this, not just high-end luxury cars. \n\nMy Mazda MX-5 has a totally different \u201cone-ness\u201d that\u2019s more like riding a horse than dancing a waltz, like the Merc. But there\u2019s something unique about driving a good, solid, premium vehicle.\n\nMy BMWs made me feel incredibly impatient under 70 mph, they strongly encouraged me to go faster and faster. 85 mph was the sweet spot.\n\nThe Mercedes almost makes me want to drive slowly. It\u2019s so nearly silent, that 90 mph is a dull roar where I can still whisper to my passenger and have a conversation. Going 65, it\u2019s pretty damn silent.

It was a fine and fun car, but \u201cBMW driver\u201d\ncomes with a stigma that I didn\u2019t like and was HAPPY to be rid of.\n\nFYI:  I cannot compare experience to a Maybach or other real luxury brand.",

Plastic that doesn't feel cheap and stands up to years of use. The tech has even held up fine, zero issues. Both of those pale in comparison to the Jaguars we have. Even better and comfier seats, smooth ride without being numb, comfortable highway cruiser and properly aggressive on a back road. \n\nI see value in the build quality and materials choices, fit and finish, driving feel, and don't mind extra wrenching or paying for it.

            "For me it's really about what luxury cars do objectively better\n\nI am super sensitive to sound, so their focus on NVH is worth the money. Motorcycles have pretty much destroyed my acceleration scale so that's worth it too. \n\nPlus the way I see it, even though I don't spend as much time in my cars as I used to, when I was spending 12+ hours a week in a penalty box it really wore me down. Even now having something nice on a road trip makes the trip a lot nicer. \n\nI don't think cars change people, they just may amplify things that were already there.

I\u2019m unwilling to compromise materials and build quality, much like your Italian suit. I find I take better care of it, keep it longer, and enjoy it more than a cheaper car",

It completely isolates you from the road wisper quiet inside, tons of room, and amazing road presence.  I think its the most amount of car for the $ after its depreciated when I bought it.  I think after getting this car I'll always want to own a s-class now.  I compare alot of the newer stuff to it now and it smokes most cars in interior finish and ride.

Also now the \"luxury\" car brands are getting worse and worse. They can't charge you anymore for a car so they are making every single thing on the car an option you have to pay for.

I thought my pontiac was decently quick, but it didn't compare to 420hp in the Cadillac. I thought my Pontiac rode and handled fairly nice with the new suspension I put on it, until I got in the Cadillac and the stiff chassis and magneride active suspension smoothed over every bump while still being a razor sharp canyon carving machine in the corners. Yes maintenance costs more, yes insurance is more expensive, and yes I now have to park as far away from whatever shop I'm going to as possible because I'm paranoid someone is going to door ding me, but the experience of driving makes it all worth it.

They were great, and did what I needed to do. \n\nThen at the end of 2020, I got a job that came with a car allowance. My boss was clear that I could drive whatever I wanted, but it needed to be \u2018really nice\u2019 and always less than 30,000 miles. \n\nI leased a 2021 Lincoln Corsair, and loaded it up on options (what the heck, it\u2019s not coming out of my pocket). Whoa. It was game changing. \n\nFirst - the car is quiet. You don\u2019t necessarily notice it until you get into a different car, but there is *very* little road noise. Everything is padded. It\u2019s all leather, everywhere you touch. It\u2019s soft and supple and just feels \u2018nice\u2019. The tech just sorta works. Like when you want the car to do something, the car has already thought about doing it, if that makes any sense? \n\nAt the end of the day, you still get to the same destination at the same time, but much like your sport coat, it\u2019s a different experience. \n\nI\u2019ve moved on to a Genesis GV70 now, and I\u2019d say pretty much the same about it. I\u2019d recommend test driving a luxury car, and see what you think. My real advice is: don\u2019t make up your mind while you\u2019re driving it. Compare it to your car on the drive home. Maybe you\u2019ll say it\u2019s worth it, or maybe you\u2019ll say it isn\u2019t. \n\nI know in my case, when I move on to a different job, I\u2019m probably going to buy a luxury car but expect to own it for a long time. The new doesn\u2019t do it for me, but the creature comforts do.\n\nEdit: oh, and to be clear, I\u2019m not talking about the stratosphere of luxury cars. My experiences are in the $65k-$75K cars.",

Things like heated seats, memory seats, adjustable seat bolsters, the \u201ccomfort dial\u201d that lets you set a temp for the vehicle but you can control the temp of the vents on your hands/face independently so you don\u2019t freeze or cook them.",

In my case I bought it for the fun factor and not the \"special-ness\" factor but I fell in love with the thought and engineering that was put into it.\n\nThere's a difference between luxury and \"quality\". Brands like BMW and Land Rover are made with good quality fixtures and features but aren't built to last (they have been in the past but don't seem to be now). They seem to be made for people who buy or lease them new, drive them for 3 years and then get another one. \n\nIf you like good quality things but are frugal, research the brands that are made with high quality stuff and last (like Lexus).

            "PREFACE \u2014 most of what\u2019s below is written in lighthearted jesting. There may be some validity to it, but generally, take it as a joke. \n\nI drive a Jag. \n\nYou become really untrustworthy but in a very likeable sort of way. \n\nYou start saying things like \u201cawfully sorry, bit of an issue with the old wallet. Would you mind terribly settling this bill, whilst I go warm up the Jaaaaaag?   There\u2019s a good chap.\u201d\n\nYou also find that the tools given by Jaguar bear no relation to fixing your automobile and are in fact to help you \u201cborrow\u201d the silverware or oil paintings of your neighbours. \n\nDespite it all, the code of honour dictates that yes, you may help yourself to all your friend\u2019s belongings, you would also go to the ends of the earth to help him or his family. \n\nYour friend\u2019s wife needs a pickup at the airport, and you need to cross the entire gridlocked city to get there in 30 minutes?  The Jag driver will not only do it, but he\u2019ll manage to show up with a bouquet of \u201cborrowed\u201d flowers for your wife, and will safely accompany her home.  And naturally, you\u2019ll know to double check the safe later on, just to make sure he didn\u2019t crack into it while he helped her with her bags. \n\nI wrote that to be a bit tongue in cheek, but there is some truth to that. Driving a Jag does kind of make you a bit of a gentleman rogue or cad. The type of person you trust with the big things in life, but never with the family gold. \n\nYou also find yourself dressing up to match the car. Suddenly a sports coat becomes habit, or perhaps a nice leather jacket. Suits become a regular feature and suddenly you consider black tie events more often. \n\nAs you drive a Jag, you\u2019ll find people treat you as a hero. Your friends at the local auto parts shop will absolutely tear you apart, but at the same time, they love to listen to you all about your car. There\u2019s quite a mystique to a Jag \u2014 people love to prattle on about how they always break, but they love the car too. It\u2019s an odd juxtaposition to be in. Sometimes it\u2019s better to humour them, and say \u201cwell they don\u2019t call Lucas the Prince of Darkness for nothing!\u201d Or sometimes, they just want to hear about your adventures in what is a fine automobile. \n\nTraffic responds well. Whereas some other marques can be treated rudely while on the road, it is my experience that people rather love seeing a Jag. They tend to be very courteous and let you in at intersections and the like. \n\nAccept that often times, people will roll down their windows and shout how much they love your car. Be sure to roll down your window and return the compliment if you can. At the bare minimum, a sincere \u201cthank you\u201d is required.  And of course, the \u201cJag wave\u201d is a thing, but if pressed for time, a simple nod is all you need. \n\nYou\u2019ll also find yourself using the phrase \u201cthe Jag\u201d a lot. And then you\u2019ll find it interesting how family, friends and even causal acquaintances begin to use the terminology with it too. Rolls off the tongue, I suppose. \n\nIf you need a mass media comparison of the Jag driver, imagine Neal Caffrey from White Collar. That\u2019s as close as it gets anyway \u2014 maybe not as brilliant as Mr. Caffrey was portrayed but certainly tries to be. \n\nOverall you become the sort of person who scours Reddit looking for questions like this, where you can pontificate and be overly verbose because you enjoy driving your fine motorcar. Your grammar and linguistic skills may even improve because you\u2019d hate for your car to be embarrassed by you. And naturally, you need to put a preface before you do, because if you didn\u2019t, people may actually think you\u2019re serious about it all \ud83d\ude1d\n\nIn truth, the type of car you drive doesn\u2019t really matter. They all work the same in today\u2019s traffic. Luxury performance cars are just really nice experiences because they make sitting in a traffic jam more enjoyable. \n\nBut if you ever get a bit of open back road, with some beautiful scenery and a decent speed limit?  Then look out, because the drive\u2026oh the drive. It\u2019s wonderful. \n\nAnd it MAY garner you some points with a person you may have your eye on. But to be honest, if you need to rely on your car to attract someone, you probably need to do some self-improvement. A nice car is a nice bonus, rather than a main feature.",

            "There was a study that showed that when you put a person in a luxury car their empathy for others decreased measurably.

            "And it's in the detail around the design as well, as no two luxury brands are alike. A high end Mercedes versus a Lincoln are designed for very different customers with different priorities, despite a similar quality feel to the controls and similar level of luxury.  A G wagon versus a Navigator are just different. \n\nIt's also OK to not enjoy the luxury cars as much as something more pedestrian.  My partner drives a Lincoln and loves it, while I drive an Edge ST because I prefer the driving experience, and my brother went for a Cadillac and S class Mercedes, everybody is different.\n\nI will say that it really helps to be a more experienced driver when you drive a luxury car to actually appreciate it. The steering wheel and seat of the pants feedback tends to be very light, while the power on tap is excessive, and it's very easy to be nervous driving it and feel that you're not getting enough feedback when you're less experienced.",

            "I agree almost to a T.\n\nThe only \u201cexception\u201d I\u2019d say to this is Lexus. That\u2019s a brand most people consider middling compared to the European luxury brands and yet I\u2019ve never sat in a European suv quite at the level of my rx let alone the gx and lx I\u2019ve driven. \n\nWhile the folks buying European cars like 10+ year old s class or Audi a6 definitely give the vibe of \u201clook at me\u201d, a 10 year old Lexus stands out as a testament to frugality AND luxury the way a European car never will. \n\nMy other car is an m340 for reference and while it truly feels like a better driver than literally anything else I\u2019ve ever driven, it\u2019s sorely lacking on the luxury side of things and barely feels any more insulated than a higher trim Camry or my previous 3 altimas.",
            "This is so true. I drive a BMW and you have to pay extra for a lot of things, like driver assistance (which is excellent if you do pay for it). Even on a $60k car, it comes with basic ass non-adaptive cruise control unless you pay extra. Same with seats, most models come with the sensatec material, you have to pay extra to get leather, which is also worth it, but you\u2019re looking at an extra $10-15k over base once you\u2019ve selected options.\n\nPersonally I think the worst \u201cluxury\u201d base models in America are Audi A3 and Q3, you are purely paying for the brand name and logo with these vehicles. They aren\u2019t sporty (RS3 excluded of course), they aren\u2019t luxurious, they don\u2019t look cool, they are just regular boring cars that are more expensive than the VW equivalent.",
            "People need to understand that luxury is more than just the badge. A GLB250 is an inferior piece of shit made in a joint venture with Nissan. A RAV4 is better than it, because at least a RAV4 isn't pretending to be what it isn't.\n\nDon't chase luxury **solely** for the badge. It will sound contradictory but many of the people who buy luxury - and can truly afford it - are usually looking for value first and foremost. It is not about spending the most money for the most bling, or the least money for the superficial (i.e. the badge), but rather what value does the luxury car and its features add to their driving experience and ownership. \n\nYou have the money to spend, but it has to make sense before you allow it. You're not going to waste it without getting something in return.\n\nPaying $55k CAD for a GLB? No value whatsoever.\n\nPaying $59k for a base GLC? Way more value. Add on more options and push it up to $75k? It depends on the options, but the $55k that *could* have been wasted on the GLB was instead reallocated to the GLC.\n\nPay $90k for a base GLS? It's *only* $15k more and those with the money to spend it might consider the value add of stepping up to the GLS, and then go for it because they can see the value for the extra fifteen grand. Scale it up but hit that fucking luxury tax? Nope, dial it back, fuck that tax, no value added.\n\nAs already mentioned, the value comes from the smooth ride, effortless power, feeling of confidence, the attention to detail in the interior, the sound deadening, ride quality, even the steering wheel feel in the hand and the steering ratio. There is value add from the badge, of course, but that isn't the only thing.\n\nAs for finances - many people want the luxury without taking time time to beef up on their financial literacy. This is highly contradictory and baffling. For example, just because one can make the monthly payments does not mean that the car is affordable. Being leveraged to an uncomfortable degree in a high interest 7 year loan is not a joke.",

            "Lol. BMW people do care about how much yearly maintenance costs. Not sure where you draw that conclusion from. Maybe they just don\u2019t mind paying more for a better driving experience. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to realize that Audi, BMW, Mercedes are not, and have never been built to be reliable like a Toyota/Lexus. However, BMW reliability has greatly increased over the years, maybe not to Lexus level, but it has improved. \n\n\nI would absolutely love to see a Lexus out do a Mercedes on the \u201cluxury\u201d platform\u2026..I totally disagree there.",
            "One of my best friends sold yachts and one of his lines was always \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a brinks truck following a hearse\u201d\n\nIt sounded like it was a really fun sales role though, he said it was rare people financed or that anyone came in that he felt bad trying to sell as much to as possible and the commissions were high enough that he only really needed to sell a couple a year but he had to quit because it was feast or famine based on economic conditions\n\nI really liked listening to his stories though and how cut-throat it was, it seems like you could absolutely fleece people and still sleep like a baby at night knowing nobody is skipping meals over a payment",

            "Wel said... I always like to point out when people tout their entry level luxury brand cars that they really don't have any 'luxury' on them. Vinyl seats, a heated seat and steering wheel, and sunroof are not luxury features, and are available on mid trims of economy cars ( and at least on many of those economy cars, adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance come standard which they don't on these entry level European Brands, until just very recently if at all)....\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Base Mercs and BMWs ( incl our first gls450 and 540xdrive) come with vinyl interiors, even E class and\u00a0 5-series, so it's not really luxury until you really give your checkbook a good solid workout. We do load our cars up, but I like how our mdx s advance comes all in. Our m50i had nearly $20k in options, and the 540i $18k.",

Nothing like getting in and out and driving the routes and roads you are most familiar with in an unfamiliar car. A GLB250 does not drive like a Nissan.  It doesn\u2019t drive like a RAV4.  It drives a lot better IMO and yes we\u2019ve got both in the family.  \n\nTake a chill pill. My wife preferred the GLB to a GLC after spending time with each.  It\u2019s a personal preference and there isn\u2019t anything factual or objective to justify your POS comment.  If 0-60 is under 8 seconds it\u2019s enough power for some and adding more is not meaningful.  \n\nDude go spend some time with different cars and decide for yourself.  My 911 cab makes me super happy every time I get behind the wheel. But I daily a Tacoma which I love as well.   You do you!",
            "> older BMWs, older Jaguars\n\nOnly buy an older BMW (with a N54/N55 series engine) if you don\u2019t like your wallet. And buy a Jaguar if you really hate your wallet.\n\nThe mildly older 2017ish+ BMWs with the B48/B58 engine are pretty reliable. A 3 series or 5 series with a B48 engine is a bit over $15k these days and would last 200k miles easily.\n\nToyota literally uses the B48/B58 engine in cars they sell, it\u2019s passed their quality bar.\n\nOne of the best value (quality to price ratio) cars on the used market right now is a 2017-2018 G20 generation 530i with the B48 engine. They\u2019re just past the heavy depreciation point now, and they\u2019re undervalued because the stink of 2010 era shitty BMW reliability is pushing down values but they\u2019re actually almost Toyota level reliable.",

Wish I could get it as a wagon in the states, and X5s are just too expensive for me.",

I bought the aforementioned X5 for $12500 almost 4 years ago, and while it lacks a lot of today\u2019s luxury features, its sticker was like $84000. I can\u2019t see myself ever buying a lower end car, it just makes sense to me to get an older nicer car and save the money I would have spent for maintenance. The engine power, handling, and overall feel are important to me.",

The most luxurious thing about this car is a sunroof lol \n\nI always prize reliability and functionality over luxury.  So that's my point of reference \ud83d\ude09",
            "You know, I say this as an early B48 owner - Toyota selling the car out of their dealer lots isn't the guarantee of seamless operation that you seem to think it is. \n\nToyota sold the second-generation Mazda 2 as the Scion iA, then the Yaris iA. I've seen a shockingly large number of them with early manual transmission failures. It seems like the transmission isn't matched well to the engine's power, even though there's not much power. \n\nThe Scion FR-S had a ton of initial engine quality issues, and the successor GR86 seems to have a few of its own. \n\nI know the story in which BMW gave some engines to Toyota, and Toyota gave back some suggestions. Since the Supra launched a few years after the B48/58 were released, I wonder if those changes came with the first technical update - and thus don't apply to the early cars. \n\nBy the way, the N54/55 1-Series achieved top marks from Consumer Reports upon debut, including for reliability. Their current reputation comes, in part, from their place in the lifecycle of a neglected old German car. As the B48/58 get older, we start to see problems with them that are manageable, but which would piss off an old Lexus owner. \n\nAnd even if those never come to happen, it's still a car with expensive parts and labor-intensive service. Any Camry buyer will still be disappointed. My 230i has been great so far (with 25K miles, it better be!), but a clutch replacement is still $1300 and a sway bar upgrade still requires removing the engine mounts.",
            "Much of that lack of road noise is also due to those super smooth German roads. I noticed that coming back from a European road trip to New Zealand where we use coarse seal everywhere - even though my rental was only a crappy Renault the roads themselves made such a difference. \n\nThat said the older Mazda 3s had a lot of road noise even for an economy car so it's pretty easy to improve on that even by going to a newer economy car.",

Buy a nice 70s or 80s running Jag for sub $15k while you still can, keep the rest for emergencies, and stash $300 a month for maintenance.\n\nI have not driven everything there is, but a well-sorted Jaguar has magical suspension, remarkably little road noise, and the cabin is just a special place to be. A real sense of occasion every single drive.\n\nIf my worst enemy drove one, we'd have something to be friends over.",

The twin turbo v6 sounds cool. No more strategic merging. I just floor it and I'm easily up to highway speeds. \n\nInsane build quality and carbon fiber bits on the inside. \n\nAdaptive cruise control, emergency braking, like 7 cameras for parking.  \n\nMassage seats.",

I mean, unless some just buy cars to get from point A to B, but even then i\u2019m sure they have a preferred brand to do that. \n\nI do agree. I mean, what good is all that luxury if it\u2019s not drivable due to issues. I feel the big luxury cars like, the Mercedes S class, Audi A8, BMW 7 Series are great until the warranty expires, the. I would get rid of them. A car like the 3 series, I would have absolutely zero issues taking that thing to 200k miles plus. I am biased tho, I have driven 3 series for years without warranty. \n\nHey, the Honda is reliable as hell, so I could see it going beyond 300k comfortably. You are absolutely correct, luxury isn\u2019t everything and I also prefer dependability. I just feel alright sacrificing a little dependability for a gun driving experience.",
            "Yeah, I've been doing a lot of comparisons. Camry, Mazda 3, Kia K5 - the newer Mazda3s actually get really close, but a bit firmer than I'd like, and it lets in a lot of noise from road shittiness. My minivan - of all things - is actually the quietest thing I've driven since getting home (when the kids aren't in it).\n\nI need to get time behind a 5 series in my natural environment before I pull the trigger on anything.",
            "I think the difference with Jaguars too is that those model years are definitely a \u201cdriver\u2019s car\u201d vs some other luxury brands feel more like a \u201cpassenger\u2019s car\u201d in terms of that magic",
            "Which models?",
            "Current bmws are absolutely at this same level. Maybe more creature comforts (more plush interior) with Audi, but everything you mentioned is on late model bmws. The thing I can't get past with Audis small - mid sized models is the lack of updated exteriors. The a/s/rs3 has looked the same for 9 years. The a/s4 very similar. Love it or hate it, at least BMW is trying different things with their designs.",
            "Right lol, I live frugally so I can spend money on the things I enjoy, including cars. I respect if some people just want a car to get from point A to point B, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with \u201cwasting\u201d money on cars as long as you can responsibly afford them.",
            "Try and drive whatever 5 series has the smallest wheel option in your market - the larger wheels they tend to equip outside of Europe mean more road noise.",
            "A lot of newer minivans actually have a lot of sound deadening under the car\n\nMakes it pretty annoying when doing your own maintenance to have to move it all lol\n\nBut worth it for sure",
