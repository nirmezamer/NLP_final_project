        "content": "There's been an influx of posts today about a certain announcement regarding Amazon's *Rings of Power* series that have violated our spoiler policy. This is a reminder to remember the following rules.\n\n1. **No spoilers in post titles!** If that means you have to change the post title (e.g., when sharing an article or something) so be it. *Posts with spoilers in the title will be removed*.\n\n2. **All posts about unreleased media need the spoiler tag.** Specifically, if you're discussing season 2 of RoP, use the spoiler tag. It's less important for the anime film and the newly announced Gollum film because so far we know very little about them and almost everything is speculation, but you can't go wrong using the spoiler tag. I can and will add the spoiler tag to posts that lack it (and need it) but repeat offenders may find their posts removed. It costs nothing to add it.\\*\n\n\n\n\\* ^(You do not need to add spoiler tags to discussions of any material that is already released, that is, the books, the Jackson films, etc. This applies only to new material.)",

OH, OH, and my other favorite part (lol) is something they only implied with a sweeping camera shot in the film, which is his voice somehow booming loudly enough for every one of the thousands of assembled Rohirrim to hear clearly, which is some straight-up superhero/Jesus shit.\n\nYour aging, weary King sees the unimaginable chaos in front of you, and rather than despairing, springs up in his saddle like a new man, gives some orders, then gives a rousing speech for the ages that's so loud you can feel it in your chest, sounds a horn so loudly it shatters, and after gleefully shouting \"DEATH,\" charges toward the enemy so fast that neither his vanguard, nor the newly revealed light of the sun can keep up with him? Yeah, I think I'd charge right after him too.",

            "Unfortunately, I believe those were the first Mumakil that Theoden or any of his Rohirrim had ever encountered.\n\n Theoden didn't have any time to make a complex plan, so he gambled on a tactic he knew his people were good at - a charge. \n\nIt didn't work super well, but we see the Rohirrim adapting mid-fight to kite around the mumakil and shoot weak spots.\n\nEdited for clarity",

There's no redeeming feature, he's just bad. \n\nIn the books, he's a military genius who, although he doesn't like Faramir, is still fully aware Faramir is his best lieutenant. He sends Faramir to his death because he knows Faramir is the only man who could possibly command an orderly retreat from the Rammas. Which he does until the Witch King intervenes. And then his belief that he's caused his sons death breaks him. But until that moment he's played the situation perfectly.",

            "Yup. Attack from the sides and aim for their heads. Don't go charging right under their tusks! Even if the mumakil are bigger, horses are still more agile and quicker to respond to commands.",
            "Have u never stepped in an ants nest? Accidentally or something \n\nI suppose it would be scary but less scary then if a thousand terrier sized ants ran at me",

Theodens family even married with Denethors after all. They were not that insular.",
            "Once the Romans had faced war elephants they devised tactics to deal with them which was basically just to open up lanes in their ranks. Which the elephants would naturally run into to and they would just keep going off the battlefield if they survived. They didn\u2019t give a shit about the rider trying to get them to turn around for another charge once they started getting stabbed with spears.\n\nAnother tactic used later by cavalry was to put fake trunks on the horses. It would disorient the elephants who weren\u2019t sure if the horses were baby elephants so they would try to avoid goring them or running them over.\n\nBased on most historical sources war elephants were extremely unpredictable and difficult to control during battle. Trained professional troops on the other hand would effectively maneuver into different formations as long as they had been trained on it in advance. The biggest advantage the Romans had in battle was distributed leadership. It\u2019s impossible for one guy to control an entire army in battle. Multiple layers of leadership that know the common goals handling smaller groups of people they can directly manage seems to work pretty well.",

Galadriel is said to be the most fairest of all the Elves of Middle Earth, yet there are plenty of movie fans who prefer Arwen to Galadriel. At a certain level of beauty, it becomes very difficult to objectively say one is prettier than the other.",
