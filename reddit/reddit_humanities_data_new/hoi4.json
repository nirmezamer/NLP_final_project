Here you will find trustworthy military advisors to guide your diplomacy, battles, and internal affairs. \n\nThis thread is for any small questions that don't warrant their own post, or continued discussions for your next moves in your game. If you'd like to channel the wisdom and knowledge of the noble generals of this subreddit, and more importantly not ruin your save, then you've found the right place!\n\n**Important**: If you are asking about a specific situation in your game, please post screenshots of any relevant map modes (strategic, diplomacy, factions, etc) or interface tabs (economy, military, etc). Please also explain the situation as best you can. Alliances, army strength, tech etc. are all factors your advisors will need to know to give you the best possible answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Reconnaissance Report:**\n\nBelow is a preliminary reconnaissance report.

            "breakthrough or soft attack, What\u00b4s more important for a tank division/template",
            "When you guys design ships, tanks, and planes, how do you decide when the best time is to start producing? \n\nFor example, my last game as Canada I had designed a cruiser but then I thought \u201cwell, if I just wait to unlock this tech for it I can have a better one\u2026\u201d and I get stuck in that loop of researching, researching, researching better components and I feel like I\u2019m too late by the time I have a design I\u2019m satisfied with",
            "What do I need to beat Germany as French Communists or Non-aligned? Do I focus on air? Tanks? And what year is best?",
            "How do I choose between annex or puppet. If I'm stretched for equipment I should just puppet? I earlycapped the UK last game and I don't know how to manage India or the US if I were to invade them from Canada.",
            "i unlocked combined arms specialist for one of my generals but he is not showing up as an option in military high command",
            "What is the easiest way for Finland to defeat the Soviet Union? Is this possible with only infantry troops (without tanks)?",
            "You don't need to choose - a slightly more expensive tank with the 3-man turret and radio as well as a good gun will be more efficient overall, and most of the rest is purely a choice of quality vs quantity.\n\nTechnically there's a 'good enough' point for breakthrough at ~250 - but unless you only ever plan to attack green divisions in plains that'll come back to bite you. More, and you'll do almost as well against veterans dug in in a forest instead of eating lots of expensive losses.",
            "Those two stats rarely conflict with eachother but I guess soft attack is more important to go for. There's only so many ways to add soft attack so you might aswell max it out. Tanks have excess breakthrough most of the time.",
            "You need enough breakthrough that the enemy soft attack doesn't exceed it with tactics. I go for around 250-300. You need as much soft attack as you can get. More important is keeping them fueled and supplied.",
            "For fleets, work back from when you need to have them ready and you have your cutoff point. If you want a useful fleet by 1940, they'll need to be laid down by the end of 37 unless you really have yards to spare. But even then, 2-2.5 years is the minimum lead time on good capitals, and if you're building good cruisers too you'll need to multiply by how many each line has to finish. \n\nAlso, refits. It's always worthwhile to send them for another pass to get new radar, FCS and AA once they're done, and way faster than only starting the hull once you have all those parts ready. \n\nFor planes you just try to get the airframe and engine at the same time, otherwise everything past HMGs is optional. While you don't want to be seriously outnumbered, '40 planes are a *lot* stronger.\n\nAnd tanks are just plain flexible. Start building them, design a basic division template, train it once you've built enough to fill it out, then train more or expand the template as more and newer models roll off the line. Just don't bother with upgrades between hulls and slap all the fancy new toys on the next model, it's much more efficient overall.",
            "Hold out on the defence until the Soviets get involved. You start with a sizable army, but you need to clean up a lot of debuffs and are behind on industry until at least 39.\n\nBut you're a major - you can afford two out of tanks, air and navy. Just don't ever half-ass air, an inferior fighter force is just a lot of expensive target practice. Go big on it - like a third to half of your mils big - or make armored trains and AA for every division instead.",
            "I don't know about communist but I've done non aligned a couple times. Focus on air. Making an unbreakable defence gets really easy with air superiority. Then you can stall until you have tanks in late 1940.\n\nI put 8 factories on guns, 1 on arty, 2 on support eq, 1 on trucks, 1 on trains, 3 on AT, 25 on fighters, 8 on CAS, then 25 on tanks. In that order. You won't have many factories on tanks when the war starts but that's OK.\n\nAttache to China + Army Advisor + Military Theorist + Professional Army Corps allows you to get a lot of doctrines when the war starts. Save your army xp until you finish army reform focus. Choose whichever doctrine you're comfortable with, I went SF right left.\n\nYou can wait until the soviets are involved but that's too sweaty for me. I just attack when the tanks are finished (late 1940 to early 1941) and capitulate Germany in early 1942.",
            "Generally speaking, you annex only for industries, puppet otherwise. Compliance takes way too long to build up, unless you do a lot of collab.\n\nFor overseas territories, I highly encourage puppeting, because troops stationed there then draw supply from their capital instead of yours. E.g. USA can't convoy raid you into oblivion if you invade from a Canadian puppet, since supplies come from Ottawa.",
            "As long as all your divisions have support AA so they don't easily get ground up by CAS, your utterly broken focus and national spirit buffs will easily jack up any half-decent defensive position to Maginot levels. So just build up the Mannerheim line, stack up your infantry, and rotate divisions into wherever they attack until they run out of rifles. After that, even assault infantry can push them if you really don't want to build cheap LTs, especially when the bigger wars break out and they're stretched thin. As soon as you can start making even small encirclements, it's the beginning of the end for them. \n\nIt's not fast, but it is pretty easy."

            "Remove the non strategic materials, add armor plates or self sealing fuel tanks as well as the extra fuel tanks. Your Air Attack can be as high as it wants, aslong as it has no air defense your planes will drop like flies.",

            "It would be okay to use nonstrat material for some cheaper plane. But he needs to compensate with armor otherwise this happens. If he has ic then i would get rid of the nonstrat material for armor. If not then replacing range for armor is probably better",

Now every hit of enemy planes shoots down one of your planes - so I would recommend to use at least one of the slots at the bottom for armour\n\nIf you need that range, I recommend to go for medium plane + machine guns (heavy fighter) with at least self-sealing tanks\n\n(I don't play the game in english language, exact labels could be different)",
            "I always go with heavy mgs(light mgs if you didnt research heavy mgs yet) and drop tank with my fighters. Bot the best but it is cheap and decent. I can recommend it. Most of the time it makes me get air supremacy, so its cool.",

            "Air defense does not affect damage dealt by AA, either from divisions or the state buildings. Air defense is therefore an important stat for fighters, but less so for CAS because you shouldn't be using CAS in an air zone where they are being shot down by enemy planes anyways",

            "It is bad because it means building more refineries instead of more mils and investing research and maybe the focus too into that.\n\nAbsolutely not worth it for Germany. But you can get away with if you insist because well, single player Germany is easy mode.",
            "In the long run yeah, but you'll also be building refineries for the fuel too, rubber almost as a by-product.",
