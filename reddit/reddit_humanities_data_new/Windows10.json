            "Windows Shell Experience Host is taking up a lot of my CPU now. Can this be from the update earlier? How do I stop it?",
            "I tried playing Pathfinder WotR again after the update (120 hours in already). GPU reached 99-100 in the main menu, making it unplayable.\n\nI uninstalled the update and the game runs smoothly again. What did they do with this one?",
            "is this the update needed for that wifi takeover attack?",
            "Downloaded it, had the yellow circle next to the shutdown and everything yesterday, and now it's vanished.... has Microsoft rolled back the update?\n\nHuh nevermind it installed when I restarted, weird, oh well.",
            "KB5039211 is messing around with Realtek Audio drivers. My audio is completely gone. Sound icon has a red cross and says 'no speakers or headphones plugged in'. Device Manager does not even show Realtek Drivers. Manually installing them from Laptop's drivers website did not work as Realtek audio does not show up on Device Manager.",
            "Had to uninstall the update from June 11th, made my 4090 gpu utilization get stuck between 0-12% in games. i Went through all the drivers and realized this was the issue.",
            "Updated and now not only have I gotten 2 blue screens, an important file (Windows system32 winload.efi) is apparently fucked up. I've tried just restarting my laptop and disabled the secure boot neither worked. When will the next update fix this shit. Edit: I'm now stuck in an endless loop of having to sit and wait for my laptop trying to fix drive errors (and failing) and getting constant blue screens. I tried uninstalling the update couldn't using sfc it not working and then trying to fix that,please tell me I don't have to get a new laptop.",
            "With this update it did what happened in Januarys update, it went through and made my pc absolutely unusable, I can open any apps and then the pc will freeze and I have to hard shutdown, I had to wipe my harddrive with januarys like 10 times and then it stopped but it\u2019s doing it again and I don\u2019t want to wipe my harddrive fresh again does anyone know how to fix this issue",
            "KB5039211 fails to install also.",
            "Fails for me to",
            "Failed to install on mine as well.",
            "It installed fine on mine, and I wish it didn't, because it's causing extreme stuttering in games. Very weird too, instead of having spikes and slowing down, it freezes for about 1-3 seconds in which cpu and gpu usage drops to zero.",
            "For me too. Together with the older KB5034441 which was for the recovery partition. although I have followed MS instructions and made the recovery partition bigger.",
            "That tracks further than what I had but what I feared would transpire for my old Windows 10. That system took a hit with 21H2 and two/thirds the volume was lost on Realtek for a couple of years. Didn't bother upgrading to 22H2 with that rig in concern of losing much more and ended up changing computers.",
            "Not just Realtek. Somehow my audio craps out after not even hour of music from youtube.",
            "having same issues. were you able to fix it ?",

            "Any luck in fixing it? I have deleted the update but I have realised that it basically does nothing :D",
            "I also confirm the stuttering, really annoying, I deleted the update but keeps installing on its own.",
            "no unfortunately I don't think I can.",
            "Same -- I had resized partitions the last time this had happened and fixed things, but yet again it stalls forever then fails and rolls back.  Run dsim restorehealth, run sfc, resize partition again this time to 3GB, still fails.",
            "Not yet, I rolled back the update and the stutters/mini freezes are shorter and half as frequent but still there. I think it's caused by a graphic driver timeout but I'm not completely sure. I tried repairing the driver but it did nothing, but I haven't tried a full clean reinstall yet.",
            "I disabled automatic updates, so for now when I turn off the pc I just don't select the update option. I managed to make the stuttering go away, it was in fact the gpu driver that got fkd. The repair option didn't work, so I downloaded AMD driver removal tool and used it in safe mode, then rebooted, installed the driver again, rebooted again, and then it worked. Still pretty annoying, first time an update borks the system for me since I switched to LTSC several years ago.",
            "I was able to uninstall this update just now from settings, hope it fixes the issue",
            "Yea, I did all of that too to get a couple of them installed in January and again in May. At this point I\u2019m just not bothering at the moment :/",
            "Hey !  \n  \nSo i managed to install the update after not being able to.  \nHere's everything i did, with no idea about what actualy fixed it :   \n- Ran sfc scan now   \n- Troubleshoot Windows Update  \n- Installed some optional updates from intel on Windows Update  \n- I used to press \" Update and shutdown \" but decided on the last try to press \" Update and restart \" instead.\n\nCheers.",
            "Yo, how did you roll it back? System restore?",
            "Thanks for the help, I hid the update with the tool from Microsoft",
            "I also attempted that via control panel and command prompt but neither worked,control panel just gave me a error saying it couldn't delete it all,and command prompt was wierd, there was actually two updates with the same date one ended with 211 (the same as the control panel) the other ended with 995 I couldn't find any update with those same end numbers in Microsofts update history. also weird was control panel said it was a security update. either way I'm now fucked because of what my first comments edit said,blue screens and a error screen saying that \"windows system32 winload.efi is corrupted\" from what i recall,I think I just have to reinstall Windows 10 which I don't now how to do and I to stupid to figure out.",
            "no, i uninstalled the update",
            "By the way, I'm guessing the update is related to the recent wi fi exploit they found on windows, so if your pc has wi fi but you don't use it, try to disable it. If it only connects through an ethernet cable, then there's no worry, as the exploit is only for wi fi connections.",
            "as it turns out my laptop still blue screened after the uninstall. I\u2019ll be taking it to someone to get it checked.",
            "Hm. It won't let me do that annoyingly",
            "I have it disabled anyway, if you are having more problems with the update you can try the tool I used, its called wushowhide.diagcab, you can download it directly from Microsoft site",
            "I hope for the best."

Search up how fast xp got riddled... sitting idle for like 20 mins while connected to internet it was completely flooded with crap. \n\nFor a time frame reference XP lost updates 2014... i didn't see any videos of any other unsupported windows versions so its just the one time stamp but in 20 years you can have it connected to the internet for 20 mins and be so infected its nearly unusable.

This wasn't possible on my old 4 core i7 unless I wouldn't to deal with stuttering and frame rate drops when opening something on my second monitor.\n\nIf you're casual gaming though I guess you can still get by with an older 4 core by lowering the settings, but I remember some games just not running well at all, Starfield, Remnant 2 and Cyberpunk didn't run well on my 7700k. Those games require atleast a 6 core CPU to run well.\n\nAlso, running games at a higher frame rate has a big benefit, less input lag. This is why a lot of people running reports titles prefer a high frame rate. 60fps is too laggy in my opinion. Once you get to 120fps you can instantly feel the difference regardless if you have a high refresh rate monitor or not.",
