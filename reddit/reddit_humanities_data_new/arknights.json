            "I'm a semi-newer player who just rolled Saileach and I know she's expensive, but I'm obsessed with her because she's so beautiful and that princess outfit is going to be purchased the moment it becomes available.

            "i really enjoy arknights. although i haven't been reading the story, i watch recap videos and thoroughly enjoy the world building, the character designs, music, and generally tower defense is fun. \n\nthe struggle i am having is i am so bad at the game, that it feels like i'm wasting my time even though i'm having fun if that makes sense. i think i've gotten better, but because i feel the need to 3* every stage (especially the farming ones), the game feels incredibly unforgiving since 1 leak ruins it. this feeling gets to the point where i probably think quitting makes the most sense to save my time and irl sanity, but i don't want to quit!\n\ni'm a returning player who rerolled during the monster hunter collab so i'm only level 55ish, have chapter 9 unlocked and working on episode 7 now. even when watching guides, i struggle for some reason and CC clapping me when going for 200 didn't help either. \n\ndoes anyone else who felt or experienced this have any advice? idk. if i put this much thought into other things i'd probably be a giga genius but yeah, that's where i'm at... :(",

            "Hi everyone! Last week, when I just started playing, I posted in the thread asking for advice on the lineup. I am very grateful to everyone who replied to me then, including those who did so in private messages. It has been about a week since then, I have been playing for about 12 days in total now and wanted to ask for advice again if anyone would be kind to look at my lineup. I am probably still a newbie, I am going through chapter 4 now, but I have a much better understanding of the game than I did a week ago when I posted my initial post. And my roster has changed dramatically in less than a week; it is absolutely different from that time.\n\nBut first of all I wanted to make 3 clarifications.\n\n1. Although I do not have them in the main roster, according to the advice I received last week, I have developed enough 3-star players and have them in stock -- although I almost immediately replaced them with 4 and 5-star players. Contrary to the comments I received, I had a lot of resources to develop all of them. I was warned that as a newbie I would be short on resources, but I actually have a ton of resources -- money, chips, experience materials and resources to improve characters -  everything. I do not know what is wrong with me, but I do. So I do not complain about scarcity and I do not limit myself to developing 3 star characters.\n2. As I noted above, I have a lot of resources to develop characters immediately when/if someone can give me advice. I just have not done it yet and decided to ask the Reddit first.\n3. All characters on the screenshot have level 7 skills except Texas and Specter. They have level 6 for now but soon, maybe even this night, I will raise them to level 7 as well. So everything is ok about the skills.\n\n[Here is my main squad](https://imgur.com/a/4no7pBK)\n\n  \nSo, moving on to advice, I would appreciate any general comments, but I have specific questions as well.\n\nAll those characters who I have raised so far to Elite 1 level 50, I think, will stay with me if not forever but for a long time. But as for the 4 characters whom I just raised to Elite 1 without levelling up - La Pluma, Ptilopsis, Liskarm and Haze - I have doubts about the point of their development.\n\n1) La Pluma - I am really enjoying her, she saved me on many challenge mode levels in chapters 3 and 4 but I am not sure if I should keep her in the lineup for the future. I have been advised to have a Lord Guard as a second guard in addition to Specter, and so far, the only one I have of that type is Midnight, who is Elite 1 level 50. I will be looking to get Lappland, but do you think using Specter + La Pluma as two guards would be okay? Maybe I do not need any Lappland at all? Or if I do, I will develop her as a part of additional operators that I might need for some specific levels and not the main squad.\n\n2) Ptilopsis - I have 5 awesome medics, but none of them are ST healers. I have been advised not to use two AOE healers and have an ST healer. I will be targeting Warfarin but not sure if I will get her in the foreseeable future. So, for now, I am using two AOE healers, but I will probably have to replace one of them later. Do you think, if I get a good ST healer, should I replace Ptilopsis or Perfumer? I will have the resources, I think, to raise two five-star medics, and I am more interested in which of them will be better in general regardless of the development resources aspect. This will determine for me whether or not I should develop Ptilopsis.\n\n3) Liskarm - I love her, she really fits my playstyle. But it belongs to the weak category in the tier list. That said, I found in this subreddit that she is supposedly good in mid- and late-game, but that discussion was relatively old. Is she still considered good and should I develop her? Or forget about her and target someone else who is a more typical subclass among tanks?\n\n4) Haze is my biggest question and doubt. I like her as a character, her phrases and voiceover are my favourite after Specter. But in terms of gameplay, she seems very weak and just a worse version of Amiya not giving anything new. Is it worth developing her further or looking for a better caster? So far, this is the most problematic position for me. I have no one else but Gitano, but she is an AOE caster, which is not really welcomed, as I understand, and a 3-star character, if I recall correctly, Lava.\n\n5) From the last pools, I got Projekt Red. She seems to be considered a good character, but is too situational due to her class. Is she worth developing or is she useless in general?\n\nI would be very, very grateful if someone replies to my comment! I wish everyone a nice weekend and a fun game!",

La Pluma especially wants stats as she is a laneholder needing to depend on self healing/dmg and can't be healed by medics. \n\n2) La pluma is absolutely one of the better 5\\*s and laneholding is a key role, worth investing in her. Spectre can also do this role somewhat but before E2/abyssal hunter team lacks survivability I feel. You will want to build all 3 of them (inc Lappland) and swap them around depending on the stage. \n\n3) You 3\\*s will still be good investments especially if you want to do Integrated Strategies for the huge amount of rewards there. Eventually you should be getting Kroos/Fang/midnight/popukar/orchid/spot to E1 L55 (all 3\\*s get a talent boost at Lvl 55, so don't leave them at 50). Don't look down on them - Kroos 3\\* at E1 L55 has more DPS than any of the 4\\* marksmen at E1. \n\n4) Liskarm is more outdated currently but still serviceable. Autoactivation of her tank skill may hurt timings in certain stages. Cuora is a more traditional tank. You will want to aim for a healing defender eg Gummy/Nearl/Saria or upcoming Shu - role compression for both tanking and healing is very valuable. \n\n5) Haze indeed is not very good, you will need a secondary single target caster at some point so if you have already built her thats fine, but otherwise Click/Steward are generally more common to be built. AoE casters while they have fallen off at the top end, at your stage in the game they are still serviceable. Gitano specifically used to be often recommended for new players because her S2 has a specific cheese use in Annihilation 3 Lungmen Downtown which you will need to conquer sooner rather than later - she will suffice at E1 50 for a long time. \n\n6) Fast redeploys as a class are very good, to drop in and out and redeploy again later. Their 6\\* limiteds are amongst the top meta units in the entire game. Gravel is better as a bait target/defensive option, Red for assassination or instant stun. Should aim to build both unless you get better alternatives. \n\n7) Look into levelling some ops for their E1 base skills which will help you get more LMD/EXP in the long run, eg off hand I can remember spot/vermeil - there is a whole excel sheet on this. Aim to get a 252 base. \n\n8) The real crunch in resources comes when you are E2-ing units - LMD, EXP, chips at 36 sanity each and lots of materials. You will want to E2 one unit ASAP so you can borrow a E2 support for stages, a lot of top tier units to delete bosses want E2, or use S3 - eg mylnar/surtr/silverash/Eyja. Probably recommend either Myrtle (will forever be relevant, still #1 most used unit in every event even over 6\\*s), Amiya (because you will need to eventually E2 her for story reason in chapter 8), Spectre (wants E2 for 3rd block and regen talent). The levels for E1 60 - 80 get exponentially more expensive for only a very little gain in stats and E2-promotion for a 6\\* needs 180k LMD so I would advise leave your units at E150-55 unless you are going to E2 that unit immediately. \n\n9) You will need a single target medic. For now Ansel/hibiscus should be fine. If you have Sussuro then definitely recommend developing her, highest single target HPS on S2.   \n  \nPtilopsis is generally considered better because her SP talent is good and universally helpful. Perfumer is not bad but you will not need her passive regen for most stages, with the exception that it helps your La Pluma who can't be normally healed. You will not go wrong developing both, but prioritise a single target medic for now. \n\n10) Try to do each ongoing event and clear as much of the shop as possible - its the most efficient sanity use with the shop rewards. Main story wont go anywhere (I only bothered finishing chapter 8 like a few months after I finished chapter 12), it can wait unless you need a critical stage for Keel to upgrade base.",

You can guarantee one of these past Limiteds by pulling 300 times on the Limited Banner and buy one with 300 tokens from the accompanying shop, but you must do this before the banner ends, because your unused tokens will automatically convert into another currency some time after the banner closes.\n\nIn this way, any Limited Operators you've missed are still recurring, just find out which of the three Limited Banner types (Carnival, Celebration, or Festival) they are from and save 300 pulls (180000 orundum, red crystals at the top of the home screen or supplement with headhunting permits) until then, or get very lucky.\n\nAn example is that during the upcoming \"Festival\" Banner, we will be able to pull the new featured Sui Sibling (like the upcoming Shu), but we can also pull the previous siblings Dusk, Ling, and Chongyue at a lower chance than Shu. There's also a very small chance to pull the first sibling Nian, who doesn't have a rate up anymore. In that way, they are \"recurring\" if you miss one.\n\nThere's actually a 4th Limited Banner type from Arknights X other IP Collabs, like the Team Rainbow Six Operators, but these aren't regularly scheduled and aren't likely to rerun, but it is possible.

Imma try my best to explain it.\n\n\nSimply put Limited banners are simply banners that contain Limited operators.Due to that they won't ever rerun set banner.\n\nWe tend to get 1 limited banner every 3 ish month period.\n\nwe have 3 general limited types.\n\n\n1) Celebration type limiteds. They run twice per year on Global during November and April/May. They on the CN server are their Anni banner.\n\nThis type contains the following operators: W, Rosmontis,  Skadi The Corrupting Heart, Nearl the Radiant knight, Specter the Unchained, Texas the omertosa, Muelsyse, Virtuosa and >!Wisadel!<\n\n2) Chinese new year type/Festival type limiteds. They run on Global once per year during late July/beginning August.\n\nThis type contains the following operators: Nian, Dusk, Ling, Chongue and >!Shu!<\n\n3) Summer type limiteds. They run for Global during January once per year.\n\nThis type contains the following operators: Ch'en the holungday, Gavial the invincible and Eyjafjalla the Hvit Aska.\n\n\nThese limiteds basically have 2 ways to be obtained after their banner ends and at least 1 year has passed.\n\n1) On a banner of the same type they can be Sparked. A.K.A bought with currency you get via pulling during set banner for the 2 week duration. they cost 300 currency to buy and thus take 300 pulls to get.\n\n2) On a limited banner of the same type they technically can be pulled. The chances are increased for the 3 latest 1 year old limiteds...but even with that increase the chances still barely amount to 1/2500 or 0.04% per pull. the odds being worse for anyone older since they are also pullable but without the boost.\n\n\nBesides that there are also collab operators. that cannot be obtained after their banner/event because collaboration with another IP.\n\nCollab operators currently are:\n\nR6: Ash, Tachanka, Blitz, Frost,  >!Doc, Fuze, Iana and Ela!<\n\na deer of nine colors: Nine colored deer.\n\nMonster Hunter: Kirin R Yato, Rathalos X Noir Corne.\n\nLuo Xiaohei: Luo Xiaohei.\n\n\n\nAs other users have pointed out there is only 1 AH limited unit. that being Specter the unchained.\n\n\nSkadi the corrupting heart in game and lorewise does not count as an AH.",

I recommend taking a look at [Eha's SSS guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hhpZFPAKR4) to get more of an idea, but basically you're looking for operators who can either block lots and/or hit lots of enemies at once, especially if they also have crowd-control like slow/bind/stun/levitate/freeze. The less impeded by enemy defense they are and the greater they scale with atk/aspd/sp buffs, the better. Operators like Gavial Alter, Mudrock, Penance, Irene, Degenbrecher, etc. There are lots of operators who can work depending on the stages.\n\nBe sure to bring supporters/vanguards for deck-cycle like Eha's guide mentioned.

She's basically a very weak Sexas, built generally for picking off singular enemies or cleaning up leaks, with occasionally useful stun.\n\nBut honestly any helidrop like Utage or even Melantha can do that job about as well.

You might pay more per drop of something if the side drops are really good, out weighing the extra cost of the main drop. You can also look at cost per drop on each material page. But this usually comes at the cost of side drops. Looking at each material page you can also find a happy medium.   \n  \nfor instance with RMA (see rma tab). 4-9 is most efficient, but each RMA costs 72 sanity. 9-19 gives them for 52.43 sanity, and has the highest drop rate (faster farming). so you can give up a tiny bit of efficiency, for much faster farming of the main resource and more of the sanity spent will go to that resource.\n\nJust be aware that if you only look at low cost per item you can loose 5-7 % efficiency in the long run. Loxic khol lowest price is at \\~34 sanity with \\~93% efficiency, but 100 % efficiency costs \\~47 sanity.\n\nMostly, just be aware.",

Phantom is clearly powercrept by the 2 big executors, but for a new player without access to them I'd say he's probably the most usable pick, always good to have a fast-redeploying assassination/CC tool even if he will immediately stop seeing play as soon as you get your own Texas.",

Certainly the safe pick, but if you do get Texas Alter then he loses most of his appeal.\n\nAak has two main roles now. He's mostly used in endgame content to give your best attacker some ATK and ASPD buffs, but his module makes him a decent sniper with his S1, like a better May. The downside is he doesn't prioritize air units like most snipers and still kills himself if the time between enemy waves is too long unless you give him a medic. He'd be the least used of the three unless you're in dire need of a good sniper.\n\nWeedy is mostly used for endgame content, but that's kind of reductionist of her role. She's on the beginner banner for a reason. Her S2 makes her function just fine as a pseudo-AoE guard, and her S3 can open up fun shenanigans depending on your other operators. She's the only one of these three that I consider genuinely fun because I'll use her for weird runs, like using her cannon to push enemies into Dorothy's mines just for laughs, but she does require effort and brainpower to use. She's often the obtuse answer to things better solved with more DPS, but she's more fun because of it. If you have operators to pair her with, that is. Otherwise she's an easy skip because Shaw and FEater do her main job just as well if not better.",

They also specialize very heavily in physical damage (only Gladiia s3 / module pull (800 per tile) and Specter alter's doll do arts damage), so extreme DEF will also be a problem for them.

Or why slot OG Skadi when adding Texas Alter tends to do much more for your runs. \n\nUsually I'd say that the team performs well, it's definitely not that niche or a meme but the team tends to perform better if you limit the AH members to the more impactful ones like Gladia, Specter Alter and later Ulpianus.

            "Maybe if you are a true veteran who lost their sanity with so many E2 operators that they can't even track them so they started farming orundum in base, but because you have so many E2 operators the base is still breaking even (I had a profit of around 1million/month, with event rewards included)so you don't need to farm LMD stages. Try it as a new and you will be broke while also failing all stages as your operators are not leveled.\n \nEven caught up on missing operators, only limiteds and some 5* are missing even though I got the 6* on their banner.",
            "Significantly better?",
            "A previous comment suggested Degen as a potential if I get her so I am going to start there and see what happens. If not, then I might try E2 for FedEx as I like his kit and design. I will keep in mind the the skills though. And good point on Tequila. I unlocked his even and got one mission shy of unlocking him but forgot to go back when I had more sanity.",

            "Oh wow this was a great answer, thank you so much!!! I didn't know a LOT of the things you explained, this has been incredibly helpful!\n\nI don't have that many pulls yet, but I'm planning to save every single pull from now on! Let's see if I'm lucky to have around 300 by the time W's alter banner comes out. I'll try my luck with Shu as well!\n\nI actually, genuinely thought there was going to be no way to get past limited operators, I am so happy now!",

However, HG has suggested they could possibly bring them back in some way at some point in the future, so time will tell how that comes to be.\n\nHuh, damn. Had I known about that, I would've bothered with the mode much more. Feels bad to lose out on so many module blocks I could've gotten.   \nI swear that I saw the same site multiple times in the past, so I always thought it rotated like annihilation.\n\nThanks for the detailed write-up. I think I should be able to handle the mode once I've gotten used to it a bit.",

Its value starts to shine in later floors, where you just have so much Hope to recruit anyone you like to counter stage-specific gimmicks. Unsurprisingly, it's also extremely easy to E2 everyone with this squad so no more dealing with bosses with a squad of random E1s.",

            "That said, elemental damage build-up from caster delta modules scales with *arts damage dealt* by the operator, not their ATK, so enemies with RES will take less elemental build-up from them. Same goes for primal casters. Ritualist supporters, meanwhile, deal elemental build-up directly, so for them it is unaffected by enemy RES.",
            "I'd say Phantom is not worth it. His value over Red is not really worth it when the strictly better Texas2 exists.",

            "> but I can't think of a situation where that would make a difference over just letting her heal with her S1 or use S3.\n\nThis made me wonder if it could work as emergency helidropper healing if the initial SP cost was very low, however that isn't the case as it goes from 0/30 to 0/20",
            "> the only benefit to M3 is the full 100% duration on the shield which is even more overkill if you think about it. \n\nI did some testing with her on release.\n\nIn easy content, her s1 is good enough for elemental damage. But in easy content, the 5star berries are good enough and you can turn your brain off.\n\nIn hard content, the berries are completely ineffective and its entirely up to eyja. For hell chapter, d.cluster debuff can only be countered s2m3. Maybe s2m2 (I didn't test this) but I tested skill 7 and it was not good enough. The d.cluster will break consistently early. With m3, eyja lasts considerably longer and outpaces d.cluster. The protection goes from 650% atk to 900% atk as well as being effectively always active.\n\nOfcourse you can still argue that its a pretty hefty resource grind for what is really a handful of stages which is fair but if you were going to use s2, there is a tangible difference with a full mastery.\n\nside note: as for using it when there is no elemetal damage? No, I'd still go with s1 or s3.",

            "Saria is more of a self-sufficient tank. She has the better base module (Which Shu will eventually get) and she has way higher idle stats due to her stacking ATK/DEF talent, giving her a stronger poke (For whatever that's worth) and being able to shrug off punishment easier. As far as the basic front line AFK S1 Guardian role goes, Saria is pretty much better there. She does, too, stall enemies well with S3 and provides a serious arts damage amp, if your squad is inclined that way. The SP boost talent is so-so, to me, I don't value it highly as it doesn't come into play much.\n\nShu will however be much better as a general support operator rather than primary blocker. She has a strong healing mode skill (Which Saria lacks compared to the others not Blemishine) that gives you some serious burst healing and extra Sanctuary, and of course the not only memey but good DPS buffing for nearby ops with S3. That's not to mention her passive ASPD and HP increase talent to your operators which will be a nice little general boost, plus the very overpowered Sui squad effect. As a bonus you can pair her up with Juggernauts and get some mileage out of her special tiles to give them some serious survivability.\n\nI don't personally consider her far above Saria but she is most likely going to solve more problems than Saria will. Saria's still no less good with Shu's release, though, she's still an amazing operator, and she's easily available from the Kernel pool.",

If you're still playing a few years from now it only becomes easier and easier to buy old favorites.\n\nI firmly believe that new Doctors are blessed with hidden luck. It's just a superstition and I have no concrete data backing it up, but every friend and family member I've sucked into playing this game with me have always pulled a past limited by \"accident\" when rolling on the first limited banner they try for.\n\nHide your heart from the Desire Sensor, but believe deeply that your favorite will come home to you. To Our Light this I pray amen, unlimited pull works.",

            "I think they're going to be about equal. CE has a little more utility but less ATK buffs. Skalter has zero utility but markedly more ATK buffing. The healing they provide is negligible IMO since glaadia provides plenty of healing by herself that scales with the increasingly high HP buffs AH give to eachother. Skalter is on theme though.",
            "Honestly she\u2019s my favorite lane holder rn and has been for around 2 years. I\u2019m not sure she should be a priority for an early game player, but I\u2019m end game with many choices and she\u2019s a unit I always bring. If you really want her, I think she\u2019s a fine choice, although I\u2019d say other operators may get you farther in the game.",
            "Oh yeah that, I guess it's too early in the morning for me.\n\nThat said, the ones that get the elemental modules I don't think have much issue getting the elemental triggers, because they happen to have really high damage as-is (And Ifrit already debuffs) and setting up for Primal Casters is kind of a meme currently... RES debuffing is probably not worth the extra setup for elemental damage alone, rather should be looked at as a bonus, with the primary concern being ridiculous arts damage.",
            "I must've smoked some heavy ass dope cuz I swore I saw Muelsyse as the intended target, must've read someone else's post. Texas Alter is worth it. Editing original comment to reflect it.",

            "I'd say Shu's S1 is oft better than Saria's, since you're not only healing them but providing the sowed seeds for a permanent DR and Regen. The actual healing is like 1200 vs 1422 which is rarely a difference that matters, especially with the seeds more than making up for it.",

            "lol no worries. That's funny actually, I started playing shortly before lone trail and didn't pull on her banner on advice of vets. Now I really regret not getting Muelsyse because she's been fun when I borrow her but I'll never ever spark her, just have to hope for a spook.",
            "From launch, Thursday > Tuesday > Friday > Wednesday.  Likely different in the last year but I haven't tracked that.",
            "You're right when it comes to general forward help, but I was speaking more of a solo tank sort of thing, however slight I feel like Saria's a bit better than Shu in that respect, for now anyways. Of course this isn't applying like, the nuttiness of her team buff talent.",

She just isn't as good as bringing agents, flagbearers and actual damage dealers instead of feeding clones into her. Sparking is already a questionable decision as is considering just how many banners you have to skip if you are not whaling+the quality of recent banners making it even harder to skip, doing it all for an unit that is not even in the top5 spark targets considering all limited units is a very hard decision to encourage.",

Idk if she'll be playable, but surely they wouldn't introduce a design like that in the last few lines and not use it later, right???!< I think her arc is pretty nice, and I love the fact she actually gave them the child support bill. I do hope >!Arctosz!< gets to patch things up, although honestly he's the only one of the family who seems to really need some closure now.\n\nHarold is such a gem, and I love his interactions with the cast and even just Kjeragandr as a whole. Even the Victorian army is great, and I completely agree >!that one dude should get shot for deserting. Ask her out, dang you!!< You can really feel their hearts breaking when they have to resort to duty, although I would've liked to see more of a reaction to them afterwards.\n\nSpeaking of which, there's just one thing I'm confused about. How *did* Degenbrecher >!not die? I get she's super strong, super cool, blah blah, but the soldiers were authorized with lethal force, and she *did* get wounded. I don't care how good of a fighter you are, if you're up against thousands of people with live ammo, you're not living. Did Harold order his men to not kill until she makes the first death? Or am I supposed to just accept rule of cool overpowering realism here?!<\n\nThe Karlan trio was great to see together, a fun dynamic! Also liked seeing the other families again. It was really nice seeing so many familiar faces. >!Monch is back! Especially at the end, SA assembling the Avengers of global politics. And it's really interesting seeing a country try to develop against so many standout superpowers, especially when I don't have to listen to the dukes talk... A whole battleship, and launch pads to follow, huh.!<\n\nThe enemies were pretty fun (the snowball dude and the moustache on the casters are hilarious), mechanic not so much due to the cool down when a furnace gets cooled down. At least flint bypasses it. The boss himself was definitely a tougher one than any recent one. Not necessarily hard to kill, but surviving his nukes meant I took some characters solely for furnace lighting duty, as opposed to screwing around with thematic ops like I usually do for events. I do imagine EX would be a struggle though.\n\nAnd for my final note, the burdenbeasts are SO CUTE! I feel *awful* having to kill them... Can we take them home? Please? ~~Also we have thousands of burdenbeast boxes, do you think one of them contains the limited one?~~",
