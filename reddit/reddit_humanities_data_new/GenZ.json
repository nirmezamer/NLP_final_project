Why 10? So the people who argue experience are happy and 20 years is more than enough time to get what you want done. The average new congressman starts his term at age 46, 20 years of them they'll retire at 66. I think that's fair.

These apartments were clean, spacious, modern looking. They\u2019re in a major city, and many of them were in what I would consider high value areas. I\u2019m talking being within walking distance of a river, the market, or the train station (which actually means something over there). These kinds of apartments would run you *at least* 1700 a month in the midsize city I live in.\u00a0\n\nThese apartments were all **~$150-$300 usd a MONTH**. Those are hundreds, not thousands. I was floored by this every single time. I watched dozens of videos trying to find some flaw, some kind of catch. There were none. They were just cheap, great apartments.\u00a0I suppose there were enough people as stunned by these prices as me, because he eventually made a video explaining how they are so affordable.\u00a0\n\nHis explanation was that, over there, **land is not treated as an investment**. In fact it typically depreciates in value over time.\n\nI say all of this to get at a point about the American housing problem. I don\u2019t have any faith that legislation will fix it. I believe the only thing that could solve our problems is a change of culture. We, *all 330 million of us*, need to decide to stop treating land as an investment.

If you ask people at the door of a McDonalds if they are craving McDonald\u2019s or Burger King\u2026 I bet we can all guess what the majority of them will answer.\n\nIn the post above we see the study was done by Redfin. Redfin is an website that helps you look for housing in an area and monitor value. *Red alarms should already be screaming in your head*. Do you think Redfin actually asked a big group of Gen Z people off the streets about home costs? Doubtful. Most likely it was asked on their website\u2026 and/or, since we all grew up with technology, we know how targeted surveys (like ads) works after using a website. Does it make sense that people on Redfin are concerned about home pricing? Of fucking course it does! I don\u2019t know if I should be concerned or really happy for them since they are super rich if they don\u2019t care about costs. THEY ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE WHERE COST IS LITERALLY THE MAIN FACTOR!\n\nNow does this mean this study is wrong? No. Could Redfin actually took the time to do an actual really good accurate survey? Yeah they totally could have but I\u2019m skeptical. \n\nSo what did we learn today? Check who did the study. It can help a lot with gauging the accuracy of the study or tell you if it\u2019s bullshit. Lots of times they hide it a lot better by just saying according to new study or according to researchers. This one literally says hey I\u2019m probably a super inaccurate bullshit study right at the end of it. \n\nNevertheless, good luck out there gang finding a house. It\u2019s just so costly.

            "Ight you already getting downvoted for this so I\u2019m gonna explain before you complain. \n\nHousing works on supply and demand just like any other kind of good the problem is that housing is heavily regulated on the local level and state level.  \n\nOne cause of this, If you already own a house you should do everything possible to reduce supply of housing as places with more houses, apartment buildings, etc are usually lower income and less desirable which lowers property values that means your house is less valuable. This leads to that 10 story apartment complex not being built cause Karen down the street goes to city hall and tells them to shut that shit down as it\u2019s going to effect the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the neighborhood. \n\nAnother problem is lots of tons down want to build over a certain of number of stories for a residential buildings. This is for for a city of 50,000 but a city of 2 million it starts to lead to obviously problems with a shit ton of people fighting over x places to live without having to make hour long drives. This leads to developers and corporations raising prices because financially there is no reason not too. \n\nThere are tons of more reasons that I could spend an hour going on about I just listed two. Building more, higher, and denser housing for everyone is going to lower the cost of housing. It\u2019s even started happening in my city Raleigh. The only place high rise apartment building are allowed to be built which is close to downtown has seen rent fall while the entire rest of the city and adjacent cities rent keeps going up.\n\nRent control actually leads to less housing being built as developers don\u2019t feel it\u2019s profitable to build new housing, which for people who don\u2019t live in a rent controlled place leads to less supply which means higher cost.\n\nLiterally any major city in the US has about +20 years sometimes 40 or even 60 years of not enough housing being built.

Austin has gotten lucky that this possible incentive hasn\u2019t led to measurably increased demand though, which is why rents have fallen there. Beyond that, rents have also fallen in other states that do have a state income tax, so clearly whether or not a state levies one has a negligible impact.\n\nSecondly, the total overall tax burden is higher for lower and middle to lower-middle income earners in Texas than in many other states due to Texas\u2019 rather regressive tax structure, so for a significant number of people in the US, Texas\u2019 lack of a state income tax would actually result in them *losing* a larger share of their income to taxes if they were to move there. This decrease in disposable income (meaning how much of your income is left after taxes) serves to actually disincentivize developers to build in Texas as it decreases the potential customer base in the short term. While some developers tend to be more forward thinking and don\u2019t mind this, there are many developers that do, and for those that do it serves as an incentive to build elsewhere.\n\nTo Texas\u2019 credit, they have a lot of wide open and relatively flat land surrounding most of their major cities, so their geography alone serves as a significant incentive to build there as it\u2019s less cost for developers, which likely offsets many of the things that disincentivize developers to build there."

BUT, the Liberty vs. Security scale really tilts in favor of getting those guns out of there imo.  Even if 90% of domestic violence charges get dropped, or were illegitimate-  it'd still be worth it to try and ensure the safety of someone who's already in a dangerous situation regardless of the firearms.  Now, I'm not saying they should confiscate all of a gun enthusiasts firearms indefinitely or start handing out felonies on quick-draw-  but it's perfectly reasonable to remove weapons from such a sensitive and potentially life threatening situation as a precaution.  If they're truly innocent, then they can have their guns back once the investigations are done and a court gives the clear.

Meaning thousands of innocent civilians have had their firearms taken away from them and often never returned, even when later shown to be innocent. Of course this level of incompetence or injustice can go both ways, so I tend to err on the side of at least temporarily having firearms taken away, so as to possibly protect those who might be in danger... but we need to make certain it is only temporary, unless the abuse or threats are actually real.\n\nI have heard many tales about ex-wives or even ex-husbands [or boyfriends and girlfriends] lying about abuse, just to screw over their former significant other... and that can end up doing all sorts of permanent harm.

            "Probably a good amount of credit card debt being used to finance such a lifestyle is involved. Also a general refusal to repay student loans.",
            "I actually know the answer\n\nAn obscene amount of debt, like, million fucking dollars in debt\n\nA relative of mine has almost no income but somehow seems to always have the latest tech. She sustains such a lifestyle by owing money to everyone, the bank, the government, her friends, relatives and pretty much everyone dumb enough to lend her money",

            "EBT and food stamps probably. Government's paying for their food. I know cuz that's what I do. It's funny because I'd make less money if I made any more money.",

            "I can\u2019t speak for everyone but at my job most of my coworkers are on some sort of government assistance. Most of them have children so they get food stamps, Medicaid, section 8 etc etc. whereas since I live by myself I can\u2019t get approved for anything. It would honestly be cheaper to take a pay cut and get all the government benefits than it would to continue making my current rate.",
            "Well, hate to break it to you, but they are paying less taxes. Therefore, you are helping to support those kids, and subsidize their parent\u2019s income, while barely managing to get by yourself.",
            "It's called rich parents and/or a spouse who makes significantly more than you.",
            "Define better living?",
            "Debt is pretty likely, but if it's genuinely everyone, have you considered you may be bad at managing your finances?\n\nAlso, maybe their spouses have decent jobs, or they inherited some stuff.",

            "I mean credit card debt catches up eventually. Maybe they\u2019re just good with money. Gen Z\u2019s financial literacy skills are abysmally low",
            "I doubt it. I have 1-2% utilization on my credit cards. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s generally people more senior in the company are paid better. That\u2019s how it is where I work",
            "That's one answer, another one is a very strict budget. My coworker is the sole provider for a family of 4, but I would rather have a bunch of games, vacation trips and a project car \ud83d\ude02",
            "How do people do this though? My credit score is more than fine, and I have a reasonable lending history\u2014I've never been able to take out a loan, a credit card with a high limit, or get an apartment, without a boomer parent to cosign.\n\nI can't even get those shitty medical loan places that only pay out like 100 to 2000 dollars to give me a loan for a procedure.\n\nI just don't understand how these people get these loans, or cards, to be able to live like this???",

            "Felt. I make 300$ too much a month to qualify for my states medicaid, which is arguably better than my workplace.",
            "They should change the laws to force accounting of every dime spent from child support and social welfare.\n\nThere is no doubt some mothers take the children's money to go spend on hair and nails.",
            "Everyone laugh at the guy that thinks welfare queens are real. \n\nHoly shit dude.",
            "I mean, yeah, but as long as you make the payments and have the income, credit card companies are willing to just increase your limits willy-nilly.\n\nAlso, I think that if Gen Z was able to make a living wage across the board we'd be able to live as comfortably as some older people. You can't budget yourself out of poverty without getting a job with higher pay, a decent inheritance, or luck in a lottery.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re abysmally low. Gen-Z is young and typically financial literacy comes with age and experience.",
            "Parents.",
            "Yeah I knew some friends who were like homeless level broke and they refused to give up Starbucks drinks everyday with snacks to treat themselves. To some people, those are non negotiables and I was shocked cuz that shit really adds up fast and they just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s \u201conly $15\u201d.",
            "Sure he pays minimum and gets a new CC every year... It is insane that 2/3 of the responses pointed to CC debt",
            "These systems definitely need revising, though sadly the Republicans only want to gut these programs and the Dems only want to expand these fundamentally flawed systems. \n\nThe mother should not automatically be given custody of the child, it should not be acceptable behavior for the mother to teach the kid to hate their biological father, child support use should be monitored, and EBT money should not be used to purchase unhealthy foods like soda and candy.",
            "No they shouldn't. You have to pay people to do the auditing.",
            "he\u2019s wrong for making it out to be such a common occurrence, and a decision only made by women, but unfortunately people do not always spend the money on their kids. here in australia there used to be a \u2018baby bonus\u2019 of a few thousand dollars when you had a kid, it was a common enough occurrence for people to have kids just for the money (usually low socioeconomic areas) to where the government had to cancel the bonus. \n\nmaking it out as if this is commonplace is stupid, but likewise acting as if it doesn\u2019t happen at all is ignoring reality. people will literally risk going to jail for years to get 20 dollars out of cash register, a small minority of people will unfortunately also bring a child into this world if they believe they will get a decent amount of money from it.",
            "I\u2019ve met like 3 people with a dozen kids. Yes **a dozen kids**. Why did they choose to have a dozen kids? And I quote \u201cI need more benefits.\u201d Then they turn around and sell their food stamps",
            "[deleted]",
            "I think you could absolutely budget yourself out of poverty, but it\u2019s extremely hard and the sad reality is most people will never be able to. You also need to be lucky in a way, too. It\u2019s much easier if you\u2019re single and poor vs have a family. Also yes we need livable wages",
            "Yeah like I just got out on my own. Am I supposed to magically be good with cash?",
            "Dawg you think welfare queens are real. \n\nYou should not be attempting to discuss this topic until you stop believing in reaganite fairy tales.",
            "I'm notoriously bad at making my points, but yes you are correct. I live in what could be considered a low socioeconomic area, and perhaps that's why this issue seems more commonplace to me than to others.",
            "Meanwhile there are hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients who do not do that, assuming you aren't making shit up.",
            "I mean legally, if their child\u2019s needs aren\u2019t being met, then yeah that\u2019s considered neglect. Most of these moms you\u2019re talking about have income outside of welfare and child support. Who\u2019s to say she\u2019s not using her money for the kid and child support for hair and nails? Or is it possible they\u2019re using their money on hair and nails and child support for their children\u2019s needs?",
            "I think you're delusional. I'm sorry that no one has explained this to you, but it's actually impossible to 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps.' So no, you can't \"budget yourself out of poverty\" you noob. Poverty is often caused by forces outside of the people's control. Please read a book or something.",
            "You can budget yourself out of poverty if you're lucky and have the proper support and body that allows you to, but some literally cannot. Some people literally can't work more than a certain amount of time a week due to physical health or responsibilities that require their attention, due to our age it's almost impossible to get disability for those that need it so if your health isn't good enough to work two jobs well you're shit out of luck. Plus even if you could it's not like working 80 hours a week at Mcdonald's will allow you to afford the insanely expensive medicine you need to live. Of course, this isn't everyone and if you have a healthy body and will then sure you can force your way out of poverty simply by destroying yourself and giving up all your time to working, but many people cannot, and even for those who can we simply shouldn't have to.",
            "So you don\u2019t think that there\u2019s women who abuse the welfare system in the US whatsoever? Total fairytale?",
            "I think the food stamp program is a great thing. However, I think the mothers selling their food stamps for drugs. Should go to prison. For stealing food out of their children\u2019s mouths. Have a nice day. You obviously grew up privileged lmfao. \u201cAssuming you aren\u2019t making shit up\u201d you just ain\u2019t seen it before. This is too common\n\nEdit: I think it\u2019s really ironic this is downvoted by people. That have never had to experience this. I know they haven\u2019t, because don\u2019t even think it\u2019s real. They literally don\u2019t even believe it can even happen. Privileged ass mfs. Like y\u2019all think y\u2019all know shit. People be pushing out kids. Especially when they get taken away by the state. Just so they can get more government assistance. This literally happened to my wife, and she was in child protective services for years. We both were. You mfs don\u2019t know shit, and don\u2019t try to tell me you do. When you\u2019re just a privileged ass mf speaking propaganda",
            "Not sure the stats on child support but for snap and EBT, the vast majority of recipients are employed.",
            "Everyone's experiences are different. I'd really like to go into mine to prove my point, but I also rather not get doxxed. \n\nTo the point of the meme however, you can make a lot of money with 3 kids from 3 different absent fathers and not have to pay for food because you knew a good lawyer and got one or more of the kids diagnosed with autism. \n\nSay you got 300 dollars a month from each of the fathers and 500 in food stamps from the government and got a lot of your essentials from the local food pantry. That's food covered and rent nearly paid, and that's at the low estimate.",
            "I think you\u2019re wrong. I was raised begging people to buy the food my mom made outside of supermarkets when I was 3. Now I\u2019m making 100gs in Illinois. My closest homies were all broke af too. All of us are successful now and we were born two years before you.",
            "I think the number that actually exist are insignificant, and most proposals to do anything about them would be a disservice to the people who actually need these programs.",
            "You're painting it as if it's a common occurrence that happens among most SNAP recipients. You know it isn't, but your disdain for the poor is so great that you'd rather attack social welfare programs than address the actual causes of poverty. Also, you're likely making shit up. People like you typically aren't being genuine when you deliberately espouse right wing talking points about things you don't understand.",
            "Yeah they\u2019re also heavily missing the fact that for SNAP the amount you receive comes out of your child support amount, at least in Florida anyways. I declined SNAP because of it. We live on a farm right next door to my parents, food really isn\u2019t an issue for me. Childcare costs are however so child support usually goes to that. I also work for a living. I\u2019m sure my baby daddy fully sings along to gold digger whenever I get my hair done at the local hair school for $20 lol. Child support doesn\u2019t even cover daycare costs.",
            "I don\u2019t think you really understand how government welfare works and that\u2019s ok! No one\u2019s getting free rent lol, and that shits expensive nowadays. I\u2019m a single mom and if there was a way for me to get everything for free like you say I can trust me I would be. Not to mention the fact that food stamps comes out of your child support amount, childcare costs, gas in your tank and keeping your car safe and running, electric bills, phone bills, Wi-Fi. I think you just don\u2019t like single moms bro.",
            "That's not budgeting out of poverty, that's just getting into a job that pays enough to not be impoverished.",
            "(X)",
            "So, they do exist, then. Correct? I didn\u2019t say anything else besides that",
            "My disdain for the poor? Dude I grew up in the 3rd ward of Houston. I saw this shit way too much. You also sound privileged af. Just like the other guy. Y\u2019all wanna talk about this shit, but don\u2019t know nothing about it. Wild asf. I also didn\u2019t say it just was \u201ccommon.\u201d I just said it happens, and it does. I even said I support food stamps. Stop being disingenuous",
            "If that number is negligible, then why are you suggesting that abuse of social welfare programs is rampant and costly? Mind you, these programs make up a very small amount of our annual budget in the U.S. Just say you hate poor people and go about your business, man. Enough of this \"I WaS JuSt AsKinG a QuEsTioN,\" type bullshit.",
