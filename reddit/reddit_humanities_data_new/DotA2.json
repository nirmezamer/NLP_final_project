I think Ari has taken over the drafting .. i don't know what role misha is serving now. i expect them to disband after riyadh.\n\nOG should put more effort in fixing technical & game-play discipline issues inside the team, rather than making movies on players who is yet to qualify for TI ...",

Unless teams are going to start keeping reserves on the payroll, can\u2019t they relax the stand-in rules across the board?

            "The issue is that if they compete from the open qualifier with a stand-in and then win it, they could use stand in closed qualifier with lesser match restrictions, but since they are invited to closed qualifiers and choose to play closed qualifiers directly, they were not allowed to use a stand-in and only from the pressure from org and pgl did they allow a single match stand-in. Tbh I don't think they were gonna qualify either way to TI and just wanted some traction along the lines we could have it didn't happen that way or what.\n\n\nThey could have gone through open qualifiers with Ceb itself but since they came through closed qualifiers they would have been able to use more substitutes in closed qualifiers. You can't have it both ways.",

It will bring fresh blood into the scene and it decreases the risk of pro players burning out. In football, I believe the standard rules are 1) the sub/standin can't play qualifiers for other teams, and 2) standin's have to registered before the qualifiers start. It's working pretty well in other sports.",

For example, a year ago GH subbed in for Boxi in Team Liquid, I forgot which tournament tho. \n\nPGL's rule is strictly no stand-in (afaik), which is controversial coz you can't use a back-up for emergencies. They say it's precisely to prevent team roster changes mid tourney (to gain an advantage I suppose).",
            "Yes, but that would have meant Ceb not being able to play at TI. Basically OG wanted to play with their actual roster and were hoping the birth wouldn't cause issue for the 5 or so days the qualifier actually was ongoing.\n\nJust shitty timing for such an important life event. Personally I get both sides, and feel like medical emergencies should qualify for letting a stand-in play. That is said as someone who knows how important it is to be at the birth to support the mother and also doesn't think that we should encourage penalising people for having a life outside of the game",

            "But that would mean elite OG had to play some plebs in OQs. Can't have that. Let's just ignore the issue and hope rules won't be enforced properly because we OG. And if they try to enforce them, we'll use our influence over dota2 public scene to create drama and outrage trying to pressure PGL to break the rules for us anyway!",
            "That also means they play for 1 spot instead of 2, for some unknown reasons.",
            "This is them trying to bend the rules, not like ceb wife unexpectedly get pregnant a month ago. If we believe this story then they conveniently wait for everything to closed and only then try to aproach pgl. Assuming if they are talking about open qualifier",
            "Playing with a stand in doesn't necessarily meant an advantage straight up, more so if the stand in being called just days beforehand. The draft would be different, play call would be different and so on.\n\nBut even with that in mind, some team do gain success with some amazing stand in like, liquid with saberlight. And I don't think payroll cut is any important for teams depend on the tournament, like TI qualifier. I think, PGL just afraid with seeing a lot of good name is free for stand in, so the rules added.",

            "Doesn't matter, you can't play with a standin, you have to permanently change your team (well at least until TI)",

I can understand their worry for someone just switching out a roster but, idk, something like that would be pretty snakey obvious maybe? If PGL are the only ones being this strict it seems a little wild to me. Figured something like this would have been a product of someone previously switching majority of their roster before.",

Fuck them because if Ceb can\u2019t be there none of them can be there?\n\nCeb will have a newborn at home.

            "Fair point. Still though I think it is still unfair as basically the stand in is playing to qualify for the biggest tournament yet somehow they wont play in it if they do qualify. I think PGL would allow them to compete if they changed CEb and not just a standin",

They technically didn't lie, but they forget to mention \"Closed Qual\" because it wouldn't look as bad as they want it to look.",
            "How so? Ofc if a team changes roster regardless of reason they should go through open qualifiers, as the direct invite was based on the performance of the previous 5 players, not 4+1.. and just make it 3 teams going from open to closed best for all parties involved",

They didn't ask to play with a different roster (which would be fine if they did before the lock), they asked to play with a stand-in which is not allowed.\n\nLiterally nothing changed from yesterday's statement, the only bias there is the people that wanted OG to have a different treatment from the rest.",

        "content": "The situation between \n@OGesports\n and \n@pglesports\n where OG is presented a disqualification from the \n@dota2ti\n quals if \n@Ceb\n is not able to play tomorrow is justified and should not be changed. \n\nOG sees that the rules do not allow for stand-ins for this tournament and understands that there is a chance that Ceb's wife will be giving birth during this tournament which would create a scheduling conflict. In which, they had asked the tournament organizer beforehand for an exception for Ceb's special case in case of his absence. In which PGL responded with an One Day Stand In exception for the team. You can argue whether this was sufficient or not for this special case as probably more stand in time should be allowed. However, no other team competing in this tournament has had this exception made for them as far as I know. \n\nChoices were given in advance for OG to play with a stand-in in Open Qualifiers or take a chance with Ceb for the Closed Qualifiers. OG has to own up to their OWN decision on bearing the consequences as OG fully understands the gravity of the situation and decided to compete with Ceb as a part of its 5 man roster anyways. \n\nFast forward to now, that this foreseen possible scenario has come to be with the birthing of the child in conflict with the competition. In which I want to congratulate Ceb for his child and commend him for prioritizing this special moment over playing the qualifier. However, OG is only now publicly voicing the problem of the inflexible rules of the stand-in situation after the fact. \n\nWhile I do agree that the rules do not allow for stand-ins is silly as emergencies do happen and stand ins should be allowed in the event of an emergency. However, the time to change such said rule is not now. It should be done before the tournament has started or after the tournament has concluded for the competitive integrity of the tournament. If rules are allowed to be changed in the middle of the tournament at the whimsical of a team's wishes, what would be the point of having rules? As all teams and players should play on equal footing and be treated the same. That is what gives meaning to competition. \n\nI would applaud OG if they were to stand up for this problem before or after the tournament. But the fact that only now OG is publicly bringing up this issue while facing the possibility of being disqualified by PGL is an attempt to strongarm and pressure PGL with its vast fan base into complying to the wishes of OG and allowing further exceptions to be made for the team. Competitive integrity should not be compromised for a team that has already been granted unfair leniency due to the given circumstance. \n\nIn the future, I hope that tournament organizers who do not allow for stand ins to change their rules to be more lenient so that these extraordinary circumstances can be covered.\n\n---\n\nSource: [Sneyking X](https://x.com/SneykingGaming/status/1804357316550234470)",

Namely because it's not an easily foreseen circumstance that the wife of one of your players will go into labour during the competition. Why does he characterise it as an OG powerplay when he agrees that it's not a good rule fundamentally? Is the onus not on each team to have failed to give critical feedback on this rule beforehand?",
            "Amazing take by Sneyking. Definitely, the PGL's ruling is super idiotic, but the moment to criticize rules is before or after tournaments. Who knows what sacrifices players from other teams and regions did to comply with the no stand in rules to just have them changed mid tournament",
            "Man people were mad at me for saying exactly this lmao\n\nIt's a fair request but mid tournament the rules need to be locked or the whole thing is just a circus. I wanted to know about this before the games got started.\n\nOG made a bet and got burned. PGL should not be held accountable for this, but absolutely need to change the rules for the future. Like a pre designated sub who cannot play for any other roster and is entitled to a share of prize pool or something. Or hire designated subs if they want to see if there's a way Ana or someone else can jump in for any team if needed. Idk what's best but there's possibilities \n\nReasonable take from Sney, I'll be honest the TI9 OG run got me into Dota but they have a really bad habit of being short sighted and then siccing their fans on TO's to get their way which pisses me off. They were fine quietly qualifying to Riyadh because 1Win was 6 hours late with visas on the weekend, but not cool with the TO rules when they made a mistake",

Pretty sure they haven't, just because the rule hasn't had to be used, it doesn't mean that OG are seeking preferential treatment.\n\nIt's disappointing to see so many people eager to point fingers at OG instead of PGL. Because yet again, PGL's poor management of a tournament is going to be affecting both the players and people who want to watch it, they're a complete joke of a TO, who have already allowed match fixers to play in the SEA qualifiers (and we got some dodgy games because of it) and have for some reason decided on a ruleset that I don't think I have ever seen applied to any other team esport.",

Rules such as these are only a means to protect players against arbitrary kicks and induce fairness in competitions. These rules shouldn\u2019t become ends in itself. As things stand, OG only is weakened with a sub and they\u2019re literally playing without their brain/captain/shotcaller. This condition to force ceb to play should be waived off and valve should step in. There are several principles at play in here, and these rules would be against any labour laws in any country. Just because dota players are degens doesnt mean we should rob Ceb off his once in a life moment. Hope better sense prevails",
            "Bad take. Also 24 hours is a joke. 48 minimum for child birth. Doesn't matter if it wasn't offered to other teams. Were you having a baby? Nope.\n\nThe point of having rules is so that you maintain competitive integrity. But also rules aren't always perfect and don't always accommodate for every possible scenario so its up to us, as humans, to judge the scenario as being worth having an exception made for it. In this scenario, its obviously morally correct to give them an exception, its a fucking baby. Get over it you dork. \"Ceb being gone for a qualifier match is ruining the competitive integrity of my dota tournament!!!!\" The only competitive integrity being lost here is OG's chances of winning a series, because they are using a stand-in instead of their typical player.\n\nSimple real life scenario where real people work real jobs in the real world. Security Operations has rules that define proper security across a company. Updated dependencies, safe network configurations, the use of VPNs, etc etc. Guess what? There exists these things called **exemptions** that people will file to the security team, explaining why they can't implement some security function, whether it blocks key functionality for the company, or an individual; and the security team can approve these.\n\nWow amazing, a rule was in place but someone had a reasonable point of why they couldn't follow the rule due to circumstances they can't control, so it was allowed to be broken because we are all human after all :)",

But the rules don't even allow standin if a truly unforeseeable accident/incident happens (Topson falling down the stairs example from other thread), which is completely fucking stupid. This entire thing is 100% PGL's fault.\n\nBeen rooting against OG since Monkey Business days, but I'm not gonna blame them at all for trying to bend the rules or pressure PGL. If this happens to your team a lot of people would be singing a different tune.\n\nPer the rules OG should still be disqualified, but criticizing them for trying to save their asses because of bullshit rules is a bit unfair considering how everyone would do the same when it happens to them, and the rules are a fucking joke. \n\nFuck PGL, you guys are clowns.",

Because we're human beings and not hardcoded heartless robots.\n\nNo idea why Sneyking would chime in on this and risk the now well established dota karma to bite him in the ass before the two biggest events of the year.\nGood luck to him, may he not find himself in need of any rule exception in the future.\n\nProperly unbelievable.

At most you will be given a penalty which eliminates the advantage you gained. \n\nI think going forward every tournament should have a \u201erule\u201c which states that a team may be eligible to participate even if extraordinary circumstances force them into a position where a rule will have to be violated in order to play, as long as no competitive advantage is gained.",

Medical conditions preventing \nparticipation of an athlete \nb. Proven anti-doping violation \nc. Positive COVID-19 case \nd. Isolation or quarantine due to \nCOVID-19 infection \ne. Other exceptional reasons \nauthorised by the IOC \"\n\nCeb would fall under \"e\". Another point further illustrates what to happen when it's after the first heat (basically the same)\n\nAfter the first heat: \n1. Substitutions may be made only using Aa \nor Ap athletes and only for reasons \nspecified in the LAR: \ni. Medical conditions preventing \nparticipation of an athlete \nii. Proven anti-doping violation \niii. Positive COVID-19 case \niv. Isolation or quarantine due to \nCOVID-19 infection \nv. Other exceptional reasons \nauthorised by the IOC \n\nWith one exception:\nReplacement with an Ap athlete is a LAR \nand therefore permanent; the replaced \nrower is not allowed to re-enter the crew if \nbetter/recovered. \n\nSo if this was rowing, ceb would be able to exercise the \"V\" option with the understanding that in THIS competition he is not allowed to compete again. That is OG would be allowed to finish playing the closed quali and Ceb would return in TI if they were to qualify as that's a separate event.\n\n\nTL;DR - Cebs situation would not happen in Rowing. OG would continue to compete as normal.",

But they chose to because they are trying to get public on their side. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but if they wanted go public to pressure PGL into allowing standin to be used multiple times, they should have done this before the tournament. \n\n> Rules are defined based on our morality\n\nNo they are not. We are taking about tournament rules there. Not laws or religion rules. Tournament rules are based on ensuring tournament goes well, and every competitor is treated **equally**.

There can be a rule about $100 entrance fee, what\u2019s moral about that?\n\nAccording to the rules you can\u2019t randomly have a toilet break mid-game, does it have something to do with morality?",

OG as an org was receiving blame but not Ceb specifically. The prevailing sentiment was very supportive of him and how difficult a choice this is.",
            "The thing is Ceb is the owner of the org, big difference. He definitely should focus on his baby first instead his work and replace his position to another player, Misha and notail is available.",
            "Yeah but OG talked to the PGL who clearly set the rule of 1 standin and still decided to gamble. They lost the gamble and that's on them.",
            "That's a valid point but - to me, at least - it adds more credence to the idea that he should have sat out this qualifier and TI.  \n\nHe made a different decision, and it's his decision to make, but the OP's framing is fairly dishonest.",
            "Yes. Baby happens and they had to adjust. The fairest thing is for the same 5 player who played in the qualifier to also play in the TI. OG is purposedly vague on their statements and keep spewing that PGL didnt allowed them to use a Standin when they could have instead replaced Ceb and not use a Standin. They have an idea on the possible time that the baby will born and they didnt adjust.",
            "Is it in this case? They have an idea that the baby will come and when it will come. If OG and Ceb are responsible, they should have replaced Ceb.",
            "u/knoxville explained it very well why things like these can't have case by case resolution because teams often and will, lie. \n\nThis isn't the only sport where such rules need to exist. \n\nIt is not fair for competitors who had to choose to go through OQ because the TO didn't think their 'emergency' was worth it. Because, in the end, we shouldn't depend on the TO's empathy for the tournaments integrity. \n\nI'd rather have a simple and clear rule set that allows for teams to stand-in. And let people use it how they need it to be used. \n\nJust to be clear, I have no issues with CEB going to attend the birth of his child, if anything, I've a lot of respect that he would choose that over playing a tournament that happens every year.",
            "... That's what I said",
            "But they had a registered sub",
            "Love and care can be expressed in many ways, save it for future and don't think that this day is the most important, remember to treat your kids better not just this day.\n\nI've seen a bunch of those who didn't miss this day, but in the end they treated their kids like shit, comparing their kids to neighboor's kids all days.",
            "TI qualifers mean almost every player is already competing.  Who is going to join a team as a sub on the small chance a players wife has a baby?",
            "It's already one day",
            "But this was the rule that pgl had set and followed.",
            "Imagine thinking you would need to when UEFA have clear rules allowing substitutions at various stages of the game/tournament/pre-tournament.",
            "Except footballers are allowed multiple subs for a team, and it's often that someone can't attend due to injury or accident or whatever. Being allowed one stand in for one day is crazy.",
            "Premier league, so I guess UEFA(?), changed the rules on jersey numbers, when Christiano Ronaldo returned to Manchester and wanted the 7, but the deadline had already passed. Trust me, for something as important as the birth of your child, any rule would be circumvented, in any job or sport.",
            "Except UEFA doesn't require the entire team to forfeit because one of their players can't attend. In fact, it's fairly common that players will be injured and have to miss.\n\nWhat even is this comparison?",
            "Exactly. It's a video game. I'd call a childbirth a force majeure to bend the rules and allow OG to play with a standin. I mean, they already did it for one day when they played with Immersion. There's no reason to find a scapegoat, just let them do it and move on.",
            "clearly it's Ceb? if you wanna be a responsible husband, dad and team captain you step aside and let someone else play so this situation wouldn't happen. he took the risk (the rules and comms were VERY CLEAR), and when it blew up on his face he threw his weight around like a petulant child",
            "Because they wanted to play with a standin in the closed qualifier lol. They intentionally omitted WHICH qualifier so mouth breather redditors can rally up in their defense\u00a0",
            "And when you get a no, you start to make a tantrum!!!! Worked every time for me when I was 2 xd",
            "No means no?",
            "OG is def responsible for not having a decent replacement. That does not mean having a baby isnt a family emergency",
            "u/knoxville what's the stats on players lying about pregnancy so they can get a sub to gain a competitive advantage?\n\nJokes aside this is *how* new clauses are made in rulings. The TO's look at the situation, gather evidence and facts, and make a determination that subbing in for 1 day is acceptable for paternal leave. \n\nSomething else like an illness might have a different clause, like using a sub but the old player can't rejoin the tournament\n\nSomething else like a sub is acceptable for VISA issues, but if the player gets a VISA they are permitted to play the rest of the tournament without the sub returning. Etc etc etc. \n\nReal life shit happens and we shouldn't treat rules as absolutes - we have to make a determination of what edge cases may arise and make a ruling that will set a precedent. If there's someone abusing the system, a new rule can be made for that too. Same thing happens in other sports like baseball - like how they ruled out little people from being able to compete due to the incredibly small box the pitcher would have to throw",
            ">will never have a wife and kids\n\nI see a difference.",
            " the \"sub\" in this case comes in the form of a pre-registered replacement for him. he should've sit this qual and TI out if he were actually acting responsible. I'm sure pro athletes don't go on world tour while their wife is expecting. same case here",
            "Ok i am totally confused what the issue is then? \n\nI was under the impression that there were no subs allowed at all, which is why this drama was going on.",
            "Happens every world cup with several nations. Unsure what was the point of bringing that up, when the fact is that players do quit when they can't attend for whatever reason.",
            "Ok. So, football has mid-game substitutions and a coach on the field. We should allow mid-game subs as well and should put the coach in the same room as players for providing guidance. If you want to give an example from other sports, then apply that rule completely. Not apply the concept selectively. \n\nAnd oh wait, wasn't it OG who complained about coaches in the game? I wonder.... \nWhat a clown you are!",
            "I'm not talking about the rule itself. The rule is dumb and I've always wanted teams to be allowed substitutes even in general, outside of extreme circumstances.\n\nBut Valve has always upheld that TI invites are given to players, not teams, so not allowing substitutes at a TI qualifier actually tracks with that policy. This is a policy that goes all the way back to when Fnatic.eu wanted to drop Era from their TI roster after the invites and had even played other tournaments without Era, but Valve maintained that Era has to play. Personally, I think every team should be allowed 1 sub and 1 coach/secondary sub, but that's just my opinion.\n\nMy issue with OG is that they already agreed to participate after the rules were laid out and are now trying to browbeat the TO into bending the rules for them, *again*.",
            "The comparison isn't the rule itself, it's that OG are asking PGL to bend the rules for them after the tournament has already started.\n\nLike, this is the equivalent of France asking their match vs the Netherlands be postponed for a few days because Mbappe broke his nose and needed a few days to check up.",
            "It means that Ceb tried to not participated in the Qualifier but doing so also meant his other teammates losing their slot in the Qualifier, which they had rightfully earned.",
            "\"don't have or will never have a wife and kids\"\n\nDid u somehow miss the part before \"or\"?\n\nEdit: In case u miss this too, \"or\" is different from \"and\"",
            "As I said in the other thread. How do they not have notail and even their coaches registered as subs?\n\nThis whole thing is just to get some drama.",
            "the way it read to me was they contacted PGL before the tournament and got a minor \"we can handwave one game\" brush off. OG said that's nice but we really need more but PGL hemed and hawed, because it's a bad look to say \"no, fuck your kid's birth.\" but because they didn't want to give a definitive \"go/no-go\" OG was stuck in limbo.",
            "That's not true. They would lose INVITE to closed qualifiers, they could've played open qualifiers without Ceb like BOOM team did when they changed players before qualifiers (their original roster was also INVITED but had to play opens, didn't make drama about it).",
            "erm the rule is that they can't be used. only 5 players (with no backup) per team. while you can argue it's a dumb rule (debatable) it's beside the point",
            "The rule was literally that they couldn\u2019t use a sub. Wtf you on about?",
            "And in the same WEU qualifier we have Tundra with Ramzes stand-in. I didn't remember Tundra had to fight through Open qualifier.",
            "The text says \"standin\"",
            "Ramzes officially joined as a loan before imposed TI qualifiers roster lock deadline, big difference."
