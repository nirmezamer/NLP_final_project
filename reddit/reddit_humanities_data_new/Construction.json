            "The man is different. Lol",
            "Not my problem. I'm just a sub on this building it. But it's not in a flood zone and it's about 6\" above grade",
            "I bid it for 3 weeks framing. I'll profit plenty. Also the plans have issues I had to solve on site. 300 ft of walls ain't bad. Been in remodels last 6 months",
            "Can\u2019t believe this is getting downvoted. Don\u2019t know who\u2019s framing for y\u2019all, but this is two days of work with a competent lead/super and two framers under him",
            "Love it. I always get told i need to start my own business. I just am scared tbh and my bosses treat me well. I dont blame you i hope you prosper brother!  If you are ever in the pnw let me know i got hvac connections all around.",
            "Oh, word. :)",
            "When plans are right and windows are where they're supposed to be it's alot faster. It's 95 degrees and I'd rather sit back smoke a joint and stay busy. I'm not a framer. Just a carpenter whose built customs for other people. You have no work on your page I won't consider you a threat",
            "One day of work if you study the plans before showing up and smoking a joint",
            "I was born in grants pass haha",
            "You didn\u2019t spend time with the plans at all before you started? And fair the heat affects shit alright, but if you\u2019re framing a place all your money is predicated on the speed with which you do it. Do your thing, but it\u2019s not impressive so I don\u2019t get why you posted it.\u00a0",
            "I'd put 5k down saying no 2 framers are building a 42x100 in a day. Lmfao get outta here! My 3rd labor guy did anchor bolts and window sills. 2 guys framed and squared and plumbed walls ready for trusses damn near.",
            "Go Ducks!",
            "Lmfao. Bid for 3 weeks. Framing. 3 weeks metal siding and roof. My 63k paycheck when completed is kind of impressive for my first project as a contractor. You're a buster bud. I've built mansions in Alaska, Oregon, colorado. Never been outrun on the job. Outsmarted as a kid but not out worked.\n\nAnd again. Numbers on the plans were not correct. Studying the plans would've made it worse.",
            "\u201cStudying the plans would have made it worse.\u201d You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You study the plans so you catch the mistakes. And cool you housed them on the amount of time, but it\u2019s still not impressive work",
            "All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!\n\n      3\n    + 3\n    + 63\n    = 69\n\n^([Click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=LuckyNumber-Bot&subject=Stalk%20Me%20Pls&message=%2Fstalkme) to have me scan all your future comments.) \\\n^(Summon me on specific comments with u/LuckyNumber-Bot.)",
            "Is Alaska nice",
            "It\u2019s his first job looking a set of plans give him a break. \ud83d\ude02 Sounds like an ignorant SOB for his first job out on his own lmao atleast Reddit can give him an applause for not getting a whole lot done and smoking a joint\n\nPoor guy said his GC dropped the ball because he had to cut wall studs. Put the joint down rack em up and gang cut those bitches yourself LFG",
            "PM I work with lived in Alaska for over a decade. She loved it, but from the sounds of it the weather is so shit it would be miserable for most",
            "Not my first job as lead. Just first big job as a business owner. 300+ ft of walls with walls straight a d laid out ready for trusses? 2 hrs of sheeting and it's ready for trusses. I'll take the reddit negativity. You're the only 2 complaining",
            "What was the weather like",
            "It\u2019s not a big job boss and about as simple as it gets. Slab on grade, one wall height and trusses. Good one to cut your teeth on just going out on your own. Im not complaining just giving you a hard time. You\u2019re a carpenter, I\u2019m a framer, I have to give you a hard time it\u2019s in my nature. Your work looks good and I like that the headers are held up to the plates. The engineering sounds weird but I don\u2019t work in Colorado. We use Simpson STC clips or fasten master NLBs to allow for truss/wall movement where I work. Never hung a wall off the trusses and let it float on the ground before in 15 years of framing on the west coast. I\u2019d be interested to see that detail up close when it\u2019s done",
            "Mostly tropical.",
            "This isn't my first one. It's my 7th as lead in my 18 years as a carpenter. Not bragging in any way. My dad is a contractor I was under his wing at 15",
            "Really? Where is it freezing cold 24/7? Maybe the Yukon Territory in Canada?"
