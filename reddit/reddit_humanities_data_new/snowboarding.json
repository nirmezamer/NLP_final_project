            "The Stats:\n\n* Male 49 \u2026 6' 220 lb.\n* Current setup 160 with rear entry bindings (Flows), Using the same Flows I have started with. I picked up a new board last season.\n* Currently ride mostly in the Midwest (Northern Wisconsin & UP in Michigan. Looing to venture out west next season. Also hit up new areas in the U.P. and Lutsen.\n* Just started ridding 3 years ago, my daughter at 10 wanted to try snowboarding. I have and still skateboard, so I found the transition somewhat easy and less taxing on my body as I am older now.\n\nOn to the advice needed.\u00a0 I need new bindings as my Flows just don't cut it anymore. It seems as I have progressed out of them. The biggest issue I have is they don't seem to have the control I want or need on toe side. I am wondering if I should just look at getting some Union strap bindings, or should I upgrade to the Supermatics (They seem to have better toe support then the flows)? I am leaning towards switching to the Union bindings. My fear is dealing with the fatigue on the shorter runs might hinder progression. It can be difficult sometimes to keep up with the riding all day with my daughter. I kind of don't want to pay for new boots if I went the step on route. I just had to pick up a whole new kit for my daughter this offseason. I also have to budget for a season pass for 2 and deal with the trips we have panned out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThoughts. Thanks ahead of time!",
            "Hey y'all,\n\nI started riding about 3 years ago and after my first trip quickly bought some cheap second hand gear to see if I would use it enough to be worth it. I have grown to really love boarding and want to now get a nicer setup. I am looking to get a new board and bindings, but I think I have the bindings figured out (Union Force 2024 L for $230, willing for suggestions of a better fit though). For reference I am 6'2\", 185lbs, and have a size 13 boot. Now I am struggling to choose a board.\n\nBudget is about $400 max. I am hoping to get a '24 board on end of season sale. Through my research I have a pretty vast list of options that I am not sure how to narrow down from here. I am definitely looking for a versatile board as it will be my only one and I switch things up quite a bit when riding. Love everything from bowls and groomed, taking my time and bombing a slope. I have started trying to throw in some jumps, butters, and a little switch, but definitely not a park rider.\n\nHere is the list, any insight into these options would be awesome!\n\n*Model Name*\u00a0|\u00a0*Original Price | Sale Price*\u00a0|\u00a0*Available Size*\n\nCAPiTA Indoor Survival Snowboard 2024|$ 580.00|$ 406.00|161W\n\nK2 Manifest Snowboard \u00b7 2024|$ 600.00|$ 360.00|160W\n\nK2 Antidote Snowboard 2024|$ 650.00|$ 390.00|161W\n\nK2 Passport Snowboard 2024|$ 550.00|$ 330.00|162W\n\nLib Tech Cold Brew C2 Snowboard 2024|$ 550.00|$ 385.00|163W\n\nLib Tech Terrain Wrecker C2X Snowboard 2024|$ 600.00|$ 420.00|161W\n\nLib Tech Dynamo Snowboard \u00b7 2024|$ 580.00|$ 406.00|162W\n\nRide Shadowban Snowboard \u00b7 2024|$ 550.00|$ 395.00|160W\n\nRide Berzerker Snowboard \u00b7 2024|$ 580.00|$ 406.00|160W\n\nRome Stale Crewzer Snowboard \u00b7 2024|$ 550.00|$ 385.00|160W\n\nRossignol One Snowboard 2024|$ 650.00|$ 422.00|161W\n\nRossignol Revenant Snowboard 2024|$ 600.00|$ 390.00|163W\n\nRossignol Resurgence Snowboard 2024|$ 520.00|$ 340.00|163W\n\nSalomon Assassin Snowboard 2024|$ 570.00|$ 400.00|163W\n\nSeason Nexus Snowboard|$ 550.00|$ 330.00|162W\n\nYes.

            "Japan Women Snowboard Tours Options\nI have been thinking about going to Japan solo this upcoming season. I have done group tour before with mix gender and skiers and just felt like I was going slower than skiiers and other guys.\n\n\nI have noticed Mint does women only snowboard tours but at 3500 it seems a tad pricier than other options that aren't as women/snowboard only specific.\n\n\nHas anyone gone on these Mint tours?",
            "Bataleon Evil Twin: It feels unstable at speed, what else should I try?\n\nIm an intermediate snowboarder and have been using my Evil Twin 156W (I live in Japan and it was the only wide board they had in stock) for a few seasons now, its a great all round board, but i'm doing less park and more carving / cruising / making sure my kids dont die and wanting something a little more forgiving. Mine seems to get really sketchy at speed or when the conditions are rough also its exhausting to ride in powder.\n\nIm 6 feet 2 inches and weigh about 200 pounds. \n\nI want to get something longer and more stable and needs to be a wide board, any ideas?",
            "Looking to get a yes typo in Tokyo when I head over next year, however after searching multiple shop websites individually it seems that Yes snowboards are not well stocked in Japan. Alternatives would be the ride shadow ban, Jones mountain twin or Rome warden. Are these good alternatives to the typo? Open to suggestions as well for something comparable to the typo - a do it all swiss knife type of board for a beginner to intermediate level boarder.",
            "you might be able to find the supermatics on sale in the summer...maybe.\n\nriding short runs they sure would be great for that. Otherwise there are a ton of cheap union bindings on sale now, stratas for 200, atlas about same price if you google enough, etc.\n\nFlow higher end bindings are great and the highback is one piece now like on the NX2s so they have advanced and you can find those on sale. I would stick with the higher end Flows if you go back.",
            "Are you absolutely positvely sure of your boot size?\n\nLike you have had your foot properly measured and are not going with your regular shoe size...becuase boots are usually sized to just fit your foot.\n\nBoot sizing first - then you will better know bindings and board width, etc.\n\nToo big boots really hold you back in progression and can be pretty painful as they wag out even bigger.",
            "Took a peek, $3500 US. Includes 6 nights accomodations, 5 days of guided/lift tickets, breakfasts ($10-20?), and airport transfers ($30 shuttle bus from Chitose?). Thats $500/day. \n\nThat's kinda wild. Last time I visited Asahikawa it was $70/night for a 2-person room at a swanky hotel with an onsen downstairs. Last I checked, the price hasn't changed much (due to USD/JPY exchange rates being in favor of USD). Lift tickets at most resorts in Hokkaido are like $30-60, Niseko being the most expensive at around $65.\n\nMy daily expense rate while traveling in a group of four was around $100 not including food. Just for lodging, rental car (4wd snow tire minivan), and lift tickets. \n\nFood varies the most because you can survive in Japan on $10/day or spend $300+ if you want to. \n\nEven hiring a private guide/instructor should come out significantly cheaper than whatever package they're offering."
