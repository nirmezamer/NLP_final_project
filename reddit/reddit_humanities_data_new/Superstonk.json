I don't have a recurring shopping plan set up.\n\nMy question is: is there any proof or discussion about my entire account, including the \"book\" shares being reachable by bad actors because a handful of the shares are on plan? Or are only the few on plan possibly at danger, but the rest are definitely fine?",

            "So there are Book shares and Plan shares in Computershare.\n\nBook shares are \"pure DRS\" and transfers default to Book. Book shares can't be in the Plan.\n\nPlan shares are in the DSPP and result from direct purchases.\n\nThe now debunked theory was that if you have both Book and Plan in the same account number, that all shares are considered to be part of the Plan and available to be included as part of the operational efficiency calculation. This led to the recommendation to always terminate Plan, which sells off any fractional shares and moves all whole Plan shares to Book.\n\nThis AMA has conclusively stated that Book and Plan are entirely separate. It's also clarified that 10-20% of investor owned shares are at the DTCC. \n\nSo by \"vulnerable\" I meant Plan shares causing Book shares to be included in the operational efficiency, which we know now is not the case.\n\nSo the general recommendations now should be, periodically request Plan shares be moved to Book, don't worry about the fractional that can't be moved to Book, and don't worry about enabling dividend reinvestment on Book shares or anything like that. Let your reoccurring purchases keep adding to the fractional, turning into a whole share, that can in turn be moved to Book once every month or two through a call or an email.\n\nMinimizing the number of plan shares will reduce the pool of operational efficiency shares available to DTC.",

        "content": "# Short Selling Hedge Funds Operationally-Targeted Volkswagen Stock\n\nSeveral hedge funds (whose prime broker was Lehman Brothers) were hit hard by their irresponsible short sales against Volkswagen, [industry executives said](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/vw-squeeze-may-hit-hedge-funds-frozen-by-lehman-idUSTRE49U66J/).\u00a0 \u201cFunds using Lehman to short-sell Volkswagen may have to pay up next year when administrators have worked out which positions belong to whom.\u00a0 \"Could there be some people who are short Volkswagen and can't close the trade?\u00a0 Yes, there could be some,\" said one hedge fund executive who declined to be named, 'in order to speak candidly'.\u00a0 \"This probably affects a few funds,\" the executive said, and could potentially spark margin calls.\n\n[Volkswagen underwent a substantial price runup before the late-October squeeze even occurred.  Lehman Brothers who was a major lender for those short borrows, went bankrupt directly because of this.](https://preview.redd.it/njhhsypvx18d1.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7efc5b29a1e4d3158f40e863260e43266c17c74)\n\nLehman Brothers was, by fact, lending Volkswagen shares to hedge funds who operationally shorted Volkswagen stock (record FTD spike).\u00a0 Lehman Brothers liabilities then jumped above their equities because of Volkswagen\u2019s continued price runup, which exposed the gap in their balance sheet (this then exposed other weaknesses because it placed their equities and liabilities gap under the microscope of Federal officials).\u00a0 On September 15th, 2008 (right before the spike from $200 to $420 on the Volkswagen chart above) Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.\u00a0 This exacerbated the Volkswagen runup because multiple hedge funds, who had sold Volkswagen short, could not close those short positions that utilized Lehman\u2019s locates.\u00a0 Hedge funds began Failing-to-Deliver (FTD\u2019ing) Volkswagen stock egregiously specifically-throughout the Volkswagen runup.\n\n# The SEC Urgently Acted on Naked Short Selling as an Immediate Response to Lehman's Collapse\n\nKnowing very-well that naked short sellers of Volkswagen caused the market-wide problem, the SEC felt urgency to slightly-modify Regulation SHO.  **Even before** the final Volkswagen spike (*i.e. 1 month after Lehman's September Bankruptcy and 2 weeks before the final end-of-October-2008 spike in Volkswagen's price and FTDs*), [the SEC had urgently decided to partially-amend Regulation SHO](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/10/17/E8-24742/amendments-to-regulation-sho), stating, \"*issuers and investors have repeatedly expressed concerns about fails to deliver in connection with manipulative \u201cnaked\u201d short selling,*\" and \"*fails to deliver might be part of manipulative \u201cnaked\u201d short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price.*\"  The SEC added, this can \"*undermine the confidence of investors*.\"  Sellers that fail to deliver securities on settlement date enjoy fewer restrictions than if they were required to deliver the securities in a timely manner, and such sellers may attempt to use this additional freedom to engage in trading activities that are designed to improperly depress the price of a security.  By not borrowing securities and, therefore, not making delivery within the standard three-day settlement period, the seller avoids the costs of borrowing.\n\n# Failures to Deliver the Stock\n\n[Only the Volkswagen chart correlates ideally with the FTD spikes \\(evidence of substantial naked short selling instead of the firms responsibly exiting their positions in an orderly fashion\\) in 2007-2008](https://preview.redd.it/vtmer2lqx18d1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4a74e7a602a3852e1381cf6f5363320bdfae62)\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Volkswagen ran up from $80 to $200 from Q1-Q3 2007 (shown as the first major spike in total FTD volume in the market).\u00a0 From Q4 2007 to the start of 2008, Volkswagen drew down 25% (shown as the dip heading into 2008 on the total FTD volume).\u00a0 Then, from Q1-Q4 2008, Volkswagen ran up from $146 to about $1,000.\u00a0 FTDs spiked substantially at this time (shown as the peak in FTDs to half a Billion 2008-year-dollars in reported FTD volume), The FTD runup from 2007-2008 too correlates precisely with Volkswagen\u2019s chart.\n\n# Causation: Short-Sellers, Hedge Funds thereby caused the Market-Wide Drawdown in 2008-2009\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h54m1bhtx18d1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=f262f9bfff8ce3a742c5b646fc75e1fa48f8694d\n\nFurther, the associated macro stock market action shows an irrefutable correlation: evidence that the drawdown of global equities was directly due to short selling hedge funds\u2019 slow/thorough selling of their other long positions trying to maintain their Volkswagen short positions instead of just closing those short positions early and responsibly.\n\n# Citadel's Connection\n\nOn Friday 24 Oct 2008 (the last business day before Volkswagen\u2019s price grew by another 500%), Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel was [already experiencing unrealized losses](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/hedge-funds-citadel-loss).\u00a0 Citadel's trouble grew in September 2008 due to alleged \"\"exposure to derivatives.\"\"  Citadel's problems expanded in October 2008. \u00a0 During Volkswagen\u2019s runup, Citadel\u2019s fund was [reported to be down 60%](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25hedge.html).\n\nCitadel LLC was down around 55% by the end of 2008, while the industry benchmark was only down 10%. Citadel founder Ken Griffin then arbitrarily restricted investors from withdrawing money for 10 months, which drew criticism.  Federal officials were verified to have been monitoring and visiting Citadel, and the [reports](https://money.cnn.com/2008/12/08/news/companies/citadel_vickers.boyd.fortune/index.htm) suggest that Ken Griffin was begging the Federal Reserve for a bailout in secret.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33rsq285y18d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad29780bfc9c1d24fe14f41f24db92148e5157a\n\n# Short-Selling Hedge Funds Retaliate against Porsche/Volkswagen\n\n\"There is no evidence whatsoever suggesting that short-sellers were deliberately misled,\" said Markus Meier of law firm Hengeler Mueller which represented Porsche.\u00a0 On that, the hedge funds\u2019 lawsuit against Porsche [was dismissed](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/hedge-funds-1-4-bln-porsche-lawsuit-faces-dismissal-judge-idUSL5N0W03WY/#:~:text=Two%20dozen%20hedge%20funds%2C%20including,Europe's%20largest%20automaker%20during%202008) by the judge due short-sellers not having any evidence supporting their claims.\n\n# Bernie Madoff (Lame Duck Period of 2008 (e.l.e.c.t.i.o.n-y.e.a.r.)\n\n[Only a month and a half after the Volkswagen squeeze of 2008, Bernie Madoff was arrested](https://preview.redd.it/1qa3i0sd328d1.jpg?width=2737&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97637c7d1a4e68a32f40368ab317cef90410debf)\n\nOn December 11, 2008 (during the lame duck period of an e.l.e.c.t.i.o.n-y.e.a.r. and after a long-term investigation) Bernie Madoff was arrested for securities fraud by abusing his privileges as Market Maker, and his associated Hedge Fund which benefited from the operations.\n\nBernie Madoff eventually died while in Prison.\u00a0 Madoff's eldest son, Mark, allegedly [hung himself](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/bernie-madoffs-sons-both-died-140000722.html) in 2010, on the two-year anniversary of his father\u2019s arrest.\u00a0 Madoff's second son died of what was referred to as a rapidly-spreading form of cancer, in 2014.\n\nA year after the Volkswagen price runup of 2008, the largest investor in Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme was [found dead](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/business/26madoff.html) in his pool.\n\nLater on, Bernie Madoff\u2019s sister and her husband [died](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/us/bernie-madoff-sister-husband-die/index.html) in a so-called \u2018murder suicide.\u2019\n\n# Ken Griffin\n\n[Ken Griffin, as shown below, has committed a series of felony offenses but has not yet been officially charged.  His firm Citadel Securities, too, routinely is charged for short selling violations.](https://preview.redd.it/4f5mw2ax028d1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=15204c85b3272b587d0500cdb14a7b9140dfcd1c)\n\nWhile Ken Griffin [committed assault and battery](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2962885/Billionaire-Ken-Griffin-accused-throwing-bedpost-wife-Anne-Dias-Chicago-argument.html) against his former wife, he was never properly criminally charged.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd while Ken Griffin [committed perjury](https://franknez.com/ken-griffin-lied-about-robinhood-communication-during-halts/) to Congress while under oath in a Congressional hearing in 2021, he has not yet faced criminal charges.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe SEC has brought numerous charges against Ken Griffin\u2019s Market Making firm, Citadel Securities LLC.\u00a0 One of these charges was in 2023 and showed that Ken Griffin\u2019s firm incorrectly marked millions of orders inaccurately, denoting that certain short sales were long sales and vice versa. The SEC found that Ken Griffin\u2019s firm provided inaccurate data to regulators, including the SEC during this period.\u00a0 The SEC found that [Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Securities violated the short-selling provision](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-192): Regulation SHO rule 200(g).\n\nWhile it is '''crystal clear''' that Ken Griffin is a criminal, he still participates in the stock market today as GameStop Corp stock\u2019s market maker.\n\n# TLDR\n\nEvidence is presented above: short selling hedge funds did directly cause the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009.  Volkswagen stock grew by 700% before Lehman Brothers (prime lender of Volkswagen shares for short borrows) went bankrupt due to their liabilities exceeding equity.  Citadel too was involved and even investigated by Federal officials at the same time as Lehman Brothers:  Citadel was down about 60% in 2008 during that period while the market had fallen only 10%.\n\nAssociated funds retaliated via a frivolous lawsuit against Porsche/Volkswagen, which was dismissed due to no evidence of wrongdoing by those who simply bought the stock that they liked.  On December 11th, during the lame-duck period of that 2008 e.l.e.c.t.i.o.n. y.e.a.r., Bernie Madoff was arrested for securities fraud due to abuses of his market-making / hedge-fund privileges.  Citadel's Ken Griffin very well may have been criminally charged at that time if it were not for a bigger fish (his friend Bernie Madoff) being fried by the FBI.\n\nToday, also in an e.l.e.c.t.i.o.n. y.e.a.r.: the FBI's ongoing Securities Fraud Strike Force is still working hard on a current investigation into short selling (using racketeering laws) that was launched in 2021 and expanded to the highest level within the DOJ in 2023.\n\n# Urgent Note to Congress:  Short selling hedge funds are now just days to weeks away from causing another financial crisis.  Yet, a new crisis would be far worse than what short selling funds clearly caused in 2008. I hereby demand that regulators immediately suspend and revoke the SEC's Regulation SHO in order to proactively limit global contagion.",

Bruh, to this day I proudly use the pink Mortgage Pig as my profile pic in honor of 2008.  I assure you 200& had NOTHING to do with Volkswagen, 2008 was the caused by the Mortgage Pig, the wreckage is his and his alone. Cheers. \n\n#puts-on-morganstanley",
            "Banks do not just arbitrarily collapse out of thin air, nor due to slow-moving MBS.  Things happened, as proven, only as quickly as Volkswagen's rightful runup.  Hedge Funds' irresponsible short sales against that innocent company quickly toppled the lender: Lehman Brothers.  Ask yourself why the 100 year old bank, Credit Suisse, too recently collapsed.  Haven't you seen the evidence this week regarding the short selling hedge fund that was called Archegos?  They sold GameStop short \\*\\*to the maximum allowable percentages\\*\\*, before then stuffing those positions into bullet swaps to hide them out of an alleged 'fear' of other institutions seeing those bad bets.  Hedge Funds who short innocent companies are destroying trust in financial markets for perhaps centuries to come.",

The economic regime is tip toeing towards Stagflation, not a Recession ...\n\nAssets being pumped now is typical of this stage of a rate hike cycle. Usually, before a collapse there is a blow off top.

GME still has Charter authorization to offer yet another 586 million shares, which will raise the lowest floor to around the $25 mark.. ish..\n\nIn other words, the more shares GME  sells at the market, the more cash they raise, the stronger their balance sheet becomes, and the walls close in even more on the SHF's.

Thus, the best they can do is try to keep the price deflated for more can-kicking. *BUT*... it's getting more and more expensive for them to do so..\n\nConceivably, the threshold is rapidly approaching, whereby it just becomes too expensive to continue current practices.

Too many hedge funds are involved in the short side, perhaps over extended. Can they escape the hole they've dug? No one knows for certain.

Will post this link to my positions update and the disclaimer for financial advice.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Lenarius/comments/1dljd6r/positions\\_update\\_for\\_july\\_19th\\_2024/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lenarius/comments/1dljd6r/positions_update_for_july_19th_2024/)\n\nIn case you missed my last post, I will add my explanation of why I removed my first two here:\n\n>**I relied too heavily on my speculated narrative of various memes and tweets to try and create a story that fit GME's price movement.**\u00a0I realized soon after I made that post that I could have unintentionally caused damage to innocent people who love the stock as much as we do and just love to buy it.\n\nIn my last post, I express that I may have solved the puzzle that is key to understanding what drives Gamestop's movement. What I call **FTD Settlement Period Limits.**\n\nIn this new post, I will provide **further evidence for FTD Settlement Period Limits being the driving force behind the stock's price action.** I will also be answering what I believe the \"8 Ball Question\" is. I would also like to make some  ***corrections*** to some information I provided in my last post. **Do not worry, none of the corrections drastically change my theory or the dates I have projected. It shifts the dates 1 day earlier, so do not panic if you purchased July 19th, 2024 expirations.**\n\n**The Authorized Participants/Market Maker for Gamestop's Stock is unable to disobey/extend farther than the T+35 Calendar Day Settlement Period Limit.  Due to this, the Authorized Participant/Market Maker is, ironically, just as imprisoned as the stock they are manipulating.**\n\n# Cause and Effect - T+35 Calendar Days, Living in the Past\n\nBefore starting, I want to make one ***very important*** correction to the T+35 Calendar Days extension explanation from my last post. In my last post, I said something like:\n\n>**Market Makers must follow the small player's Trade Date limits until they hit those limits. THEN they swap to a calendar day countdown that includes the previous calendar days they have already used up. 35 Calendar days and the pre-market following the 35th day...is the absolute limit they can avoid buying shares from specific trade dates.**\n\n**I have this wrong by 1 full day.** I assumed that T+35 was treated the same as T+3 and T+6 Regulation SHO settlement periods.\n\nBoth T+3 and T+6 use \"the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day **following** the settlement date.\"\n\n>*...the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date...*\n\nSource: *Rule 204 \u2014 Close-out Requirements:* [*https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)\n\nHowever, T+35 Calendar Days uses **the 35th day as the settlement date.**\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm) *Question 1.5: Do the requirements of Rules 201, 203 and 204 of Regulation SHO apply to short sales made in connection with underwritten offerings?*\n\n>A fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency resulting from secondary sales of such securities, where the seller intends to deliver the security as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, may qualify, under Rule 204(a)(2), **for close-out by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the thirty fifth consecutive calendar day following trade date.**\n\nI'm very sorry for missing this *crucial* difference between these T+X settlement periods, but thankfully **I believe that this does not change my overall theory**. As an individual investor, **I still believe the FTD Settlement Period we are in now would reach its limit the morning June 20th (passed) or June 21st, 2024.** (Assuming they didn't cover these FTDs with the 75 million share offering which is *very possible.)* My educated guess for Roaring Kitty's purchase in May relied on him purchasing at a higher price. It is possible that he did and it would settle on June 20th with my newly corrected understanding of T+35; however, it is also likely that he bought May 17th at a *much* lower price. If that is the case his settlement would have ended today June 21st, 2024.\n\n**Update**\n\nAs you saw in the intro, it appears the Market Maker cleared most outstanding FTDs using the 75 million share offering's downward pressure to offset all of their FTD settlement pressure.\n\n**I am currently waiting for July 18th, 2024 as my new projected date for Roaring Kitty's June 13th, 2024 purchase.**\n\n**End Update**\n\nWith using the corrected T+35 Calendar Day period, I was able to connect many more dots on how Gamestop's price action has been driven these past 84 years.\n\n**In fact, Ryan Cohen's original December 2020 purchase lines up** ***EVEN BETTER*** **with my corrected understanding of Regulation SHO's T+35 limit.**\n\n[Purchases in 12\\/17, 12\\/18 2020  Settlement period ends 1\\/21-1\\/22 in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/gs775tvx7z7d1.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b735763b23be1dc83af9b30ec9611c41a9bb99)\n\nRemember, his December 17th, 2020 purchase was a smaller purchase than what he purchased on December 18th, 2020. This would mean the price movement on the morning of January 22nd, 2021 should reflect a LOT more FTD settling and it does *substantially.*\n\n12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)\n\nTotal Not Adjusted: 1,226,400\n\nTotal Adjusted: 4,905,600\n\nI will talk a *lot more* on the January 2021 sneeze later on in this post as I believe I have a **much better** understanding of the specific *cause* of that historic run-up and why it differs from our current price runs after reading through the Regulation SHO documents.\n\nEarlier, did you notice I did not say \"Pre-Market of June 21st\" and also that I said \"the morning of January 22nd?\" I would like to share a *very important discovery* with you.\n\nTo keep this quick, I discovered that I need to make an adjustment to my original FTD Settlement Period Limit due to how the Regulation SHO Rule 204 uses the definition of \"Regular Trading Hours,\"\n\n>\u201cNo later than the beginning of regular trading hours\u201d includes market orders to purchase securities placed at the beginning of regular trading hours and **executed within a reasonable time after placement**, but **does not include limit orders or other delayed orders**, even if placed at the beginning of regular trading hours.\n\n**Authorized Participants/Market Makers are actually able to create a Market Order before open** and then have their Clearing House **EXECUTE it \"within a reasonable time\" of Regular Trading Hours open on the 35th calendar day following the trade date, T+35. As long as the Market Order is placed and it goes through in that vague \"reasonable time,\" they are in the clear.**\n\nThe exact amount of time they are given is unclear; however, **this MAY explain why we often see a pattern where the stock will run up in the first couple hours of the day, then crash and settle.**\n\nI've included two examples below but *please* note that I have **NOT** spent enough time to confirm specific T+35 settlement limit periods to coincide with these run-ups. This is just more *food for thought* and to get more eyes on this possibility.\n\n6-18\n\n[6-18](https://preview.redd.it/b5oqkzfz7z7d1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=06fbb72ac5b6cc197d99ceef91f01d7eb75212b3)\n\n6-20\n\n[6-20](https://preview.redd.it/oektmzf08z7d1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=21c8036f5071e2edafb60c254aff1acdcbc063b8)\n\nI believe 6-20's deviation from \"settling in the afternoon\" is in relation to the amount of FTDs still open for 6/21 due to Roaring Kitty's *possible* May 17th purchase (Changed Date explanation later in the post.) They are most likely trying to clear them throughout the day and will need to close any remaining **(if any)** out the **morning of 6/21.**\n\n**Inserted Update**\n\nDue to the 75 Million share offering clearing up the majority if not all Gamestop's current FTDs, it is unclear if the above example for 6/20 was really driven by FTD settlement or just other market factors.\n\n**End Update**\n\nOkay with that correction for T+35 out of the way...\n\n***In regards to price action, our past is shaping our present. Our present is shaping our future.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5muagn678z7d1.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=6351ae7ab1b5baf84a63ee553aaa74b8768329a4\n\n[https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035)\n\n*Just adding the Roaring Kitty tweet for some extra flair not as proof.*\n\nTo start, *please* read this small excerpt from Regulation SHO Question 5.6(A). It spells out the EXACT crime that is taking place on Gamestop and other tied stocks that are being shorted through ETFs.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm) ***Question 5.6(A): How should a participant apply the thirty-five calendar day close out period to a fail to deliver position resulting from a sale of securities that a person is deemed to own under Rule 200?***\n\n>The participant may not treat the thirty-five calendar day close out period for a fail to deliver position resulting from the sale of a deemed to own security **as a credit against close out obligations for fail to deliver positions unrelated to the sale of the deemed to own security.** Therefore, participants should have in place a reasonable methodology to apply this exception, including a methodology to ensure that the participant is not claiming the thirty-five day close out period beyond the date of delivery of the deemed to own securities.\n\n**It is my belief that every single trading day we are experiencing is the direct stock** ***purchasing*** **activity of 35 calendar days in the past and the** ***shorting*** **activity of the present.**\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nAuthorized Participants (Market Makers) are in a unique position in which they can access a \"credit line\" of 35 total days before they *must* purchase a share in a stock/ETF to fulfill an obligation.\n\nCredit lines are *incredibly* useful in the world of finance and investments. They are usually referring to the maximum amount of cash that you can borrow from an organization; however, **Market Makers are able to utilize this same concept but for** ***time.***\n\nBy delaying nearly *every* medium to large direct stock purchase 35 days, they are able to easily find moments during a stock's movement in which they could **purchase a stock for a far lower price than they sold it for.**\n\nThis refusal to settle a share purchase as soon as possible also gives the Authorized Participant **the added benefit of knowing** ***exactly*** **when the price will run up or crash down. If they know when these moves will occur, ANYONE INVOLVED can benefit off of their movements via options and other derivatives** or just directly selling shares on the highs and buying on the lows.\n\nThis is **INCREDIBLLY ILLEGAL** and is breaking the rules laid out in Regulation SHO for FTD Settlement.\n\nSo now that we know about this and can take advantage of it, won't the Market Makers just delay past their T+35 deadline?

During the 47 Calendar Day  period (8/13/2020 - 9/29/2020), the price experienced a percentage gain of **129% from open of 8/13/2020 to close of 9/29/2020.**\n\n**I believe that the various large price increases over this period are caused by the Authorized Participants/Market Maker settling the various large purchases using their T+35 FTD Settlement Period Limit as a credit line.**\n\nSo hopefully that helps to show you that Ryan Cohen's earlier purchases *were* hitting the market, just on a delayed time scale.\n\nBut if that didn't convince you...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/abftohlk8z7d1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=c344eb7f5acb0bb91723f58d8366ea85fa7d03d9\n\nAfter Ryan Cohen's 8/25/2020 Purchase, he transferred probably his entire Gamestop position to his LLC, *RC Ventures LLC.* Daddy Cohen must have been busy, since his total transfer was 4,834,607 (19,338,428 Post Split) shares.\n\nThat means Ryan Cohen had purchased 2,190,705 as an individual investor before we could even *see* his publicly available trade data for August due to reaching over 5% ownership.\n\nWhile waiting for that transfer, Ryan Cohen began buying more Gamestop through his LLC.\n\n[RC Ventures LLC purchases from 8\\/27-8\\/31 Settles anywhere between 8\\/27 and 10\\/5](https://preview.redd.it/9s3cuszn8z7d1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f0d424da41fd6ab54ba4afed3ebb7eef6d17e8)\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000673/rc13da1-083120.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000673/rc13da1-083120.htm)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001767470](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001767470)\n\n8/27/2020 - 433,697 (Split Adjusted 1,734,788)  \n8/28/2020 - 531,696 (Split Adjusted 2,126,784)  \n8/31/2020 - 215,326 (Split Adjusted 861,304)\n\nNon-Adjusted Total: 1,180,719\n\nSplit Adjusted Total: 4,722,876\n\n8/27/2020 Open: $1.28 - 10/05 Close: $2.37\n\n*RC Ventures LLC* purchased 1.18 million (4.72 million Post-Split) shares over an 8 day period.

The stock had seemed to \"bottom out\" and many longs with the same perception as Ryan Cohen and Roaring Kitty were buying in during this timeframe. **It is my opinion that the purchases made by Ryan Cohen, R*****C Ventures LLC*** **and these anonymous long whales are being settled within a T+35 time frame and causing a strong uptrend over many weeks.**\n\nBut you may look at the above charts and notice that not every T+35 Settlement Period Limit candle is a **big, juicy green one.** Why is that?

For the securities for which it is the primary market, each SRO uses this data to calculate whether* ***the level of fails is equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer\u2019s total shares outstanding of the security.*** If, for **five consecutive settlement days**, such security satisfies these criteria, then such security is deemed a threshold security. Each SRO includes such security on its daily threshold list until the security no longer qualifies as a threshold security.\n\nAbove is the requirement for a security to be placed on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list.\n\nSimplified, if a stock has 10,000 shares listed as being Failed to Deliver, it qualifies to be reviewed by SRO AKA the Self-Regulatory Organization, which in this context, most likely means FINRA. Once it qualifies for review, the SRO checks to see if the total Failures-To-Deliver on a security are *more* than **.5% of the entire outstanding share count** for the company. **If this is the case, and this persists for** ***5 consecutive trading days***\\*\\*, the security is placed on the Threshold Security List.\\*\\*\n\nWhat does the Threshold Security list do to a security that is listed?\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm) *6.

Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days,* ***if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.*** *The following questions address Rules 203(b)(3) and 203(c)(6) in the circumstances where they apply.*\n\nOnce again, I'll simplify the above. For Authorized Participants, if they have any outstanding positions of FTDs for 13 consecutive settlement days, they are *forced closed* by the clearing house. **Their Clearing House will automatically force them to settle.**\n\n**But before you get too excited**, let's have a look at rule 203 that keeps popping up.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm) *Regulation SHO\u2019s four general requirements: Rule 203.*\n\n>*Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) \u2014 Locate Requirements.\u00a0Rule 203(b)(1) generally prohibits a broker-dealer from accepting a short sale order in any equity security from another person, or effecting a short sale order in an equity security for the broker-dealer\u2019s own account, unless the broker-dealer has: borrowed the security, entered into a bona-fide arrangement to borrow the security, or reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due.*\n\nFor the last time, I will simplify. A Security on the RegSHO Threshold List is prevented from being short sold by Authorized Participants unless they have already borrowed a locate, have an arrangement to borrow imminently, or \"reasonable grounds to believe that they can borrow it in time.\"\n\nIgnoring that insanely subjective last part, this essentially forces any Authorized Participants to **STOP short selling Gamestop with shares that they do not own or cannot locate AKA naked shorting.** That is\\*\\*,\\*\\* all Authorized Participants *apart from* ***one special favorite child***\\*.\\*\n\n>*Rule 203(b)(2) provides an exception to the locate requirement for short sales effected by a* ***MARKET*** ***MAKER*** *in connection with bona-fide market making activities.*\n\n[Un-Fucking-Believable](https://preview.redd.it/rf3j6j0xez7d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=873ee008148b4d9f33dedc7e19be1d7858682c13)\n\nSo what now?

This means that it had a Failure To Deliver count of over .5% of its outstanding shares as FTDs for 5 consecutive settlement days.\n\nOutstanding Share Count Source **(appears to already be split adjusted)**: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/shares-outstanding#:\\~:text=GameStop%20shares%20outstanding%20for%20the,a%204.75%25%20increase%20from%202022.\n\nThe approximate outstanding shares in September of 2021 was **260 million.**\n\n**.5% of 260 million is 1,300,000 shares.**\n\n**\\*Edit\\*** \n\n**Corrected to 1.3 million shares**\n\n5 settlement days before 9/22/2020 was 9/15/2020. **On 9/15/2020 Gamestop's total FTD count had surpassed 1.3 million shares and did not drop below that for 5 straight days.**\n\nIt is my belief that the FTD count rose so drastically in the weeks leading up to 9/15/2020 due Ryan Cohen/*RC Ventures LLC's* massive purchase orders combined with *other* long whales buying in early. On top of this, the FOMO investor crowd was beginning to pile in on a **dirt cheap stock** that seemed to only be climbing. The media hadn't yet been instructed to \"forget about Gamestop\" and only added more hype and thus, more water to this torrent of purchase orders that Authorized Participants were receiving.\n\nThe 35 day settlement period limit used by Market Makers was not enough time to both contain the stock price movement **AND** clear the appropriate amount of FTDs to avoid the RegSHO threshold list.\n\nWhen presented with the choice of letting the stock run or buying a few more days, they let the stock run and enjoy real price discovery.\n\n**Yeah fucking right, of course they kept FTDing as long as they could.**\n\nThis lead to Gamestop being placed on the RegSHO Threshold list on 9/22/2020. Suddenly, Authorized Participants everywhere couldn't naked short Gamestop. The Market Maker, who was already the cause of the **majority** of FTDs, kept everything under control using its special exemption to continue naked shorting Gamestop under the guise of \"Market Making Activity.\"\n\nAuthorized Participants with any small amount of FTDs were forced to close them after **13 consecutive settlement days.**\n\n[9\\/22\\/2020 - 10\\/8\\/2020 is 13 Consecutive Settlement Days](https://preview.redd.it/qku4o7dplz7d1.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e2678daccac36e21fce3a17052d92b5da033390)\n\n13 Consecutive settlement days from 9/22/20 (includes 9/22 as it was on the list starting 9/22) is October 8th, 2020. **All Authorized Participants (including Market Makers) were forced to close any outstanding FTDs in Gamestop.**\n\n**For some perspective:** The day before, 10/7/2020, had 13.2 million (Post-Split) volume, **10/8 had 305.8 MILLION (Post-Split) VOLUME.**\n\n9/22/2020 Opened at $2.61.  \n10/8/2020 Closed at $3.37.\n\n10/8/2020 Opened at $2.39 and had a **high of $3.41**\n\nThat is a **29%** price jump over the entire period and a **daily high of a 42.6% gain** on 10/8/2020.\n\nOnce this closing occurred, Gamestop was removed from the RegSHO Threshold list the following day and the **Authorized Participants/Market Maker went back to trying to contain this situation.**\n\nThe price would then continue to rise as far more options than expected were ITM at the end of that week as well as the general uptrend causing more and more FOMO investors to pile in.\n\nThis all caused a decent price increase; however, **it would be dwarfed by what would come next.**\n\nThe price continued to trend upward over the next few weeks. Authorized Participants and Market Makers were Naked Short Selling as **their lives depended on it.**\n\n61 days later, 12/08/2020, the buying has clearly been far too much to deal with. Market Maker's T+35 settlement period limit **cannot keep up with the flow of purchase orders coming in.** Authorized Participants are forced to keep naked shorting, creating more FTDs. **It is all happening too fast.**\n\n12/8/2020 Gamestop is placed back on the RegSHO Threshold List. But this times things get a *bit more interesting.*\n\n**Gamestop doesn't leave the threshold list until 2/3/2021, 58 Calendar Days later, but more importantly, it was on the RegSHO Security Threshold list for 39 consecutive settlement days.**\n\nHow is that possible? Don't Authorized Participants and Market Maker's need to close out after 13 consecutive settlement days?\n\n**I am not able to find a realistic explanation for Gamestop being on the RegSHO Threshold list for 39 consecutive days.**\n\nThe best I could find was the SEC's Hail Mary Emergency Authorities covered in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Section 12, Subsection K, Paragraph 2, Subject A, B, and C.\n\nSource: [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1885/pdf/COMPS-1885.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1885/pdf/COMPS-1885.pdf)\n\n>(2) EMERGENCY ORDERS.\u2014 (A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The Commission, in an emergency, may by order summarily take such action to **alter, supplement, suspend, or impose requirements or restrictions with respect to any matter or action subject to regulation by the Commission or a self-regulatory organization under the securities laws,** as the Commission determines is necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors\u2014 **(i) to maintain or restore fair and orderly securities markets (other than markets in exempted securities)**; **(ii) to ensure prompt, accurate, and safe clearance and settlement of transactions in securities** **(other than exempted securities)**\n\nIt is basically just legal speak for, **they can kind of do what they want when they feel like it's an emergency.**\n\n**And I would say this next part qualifies** **as an emergency in their eyes.**\n\n[Threshold List 12\\/8 - 2\\/4](https://preview.redd.it/qebat4kvuz7d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1439d9ffed204c45a282fc53c88585b733c937)\n\nDo you remember when Ryan Cohen placed his December orders for Gamestop?\n\n12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)\n\nTotal Not Adjusted: 1,226,400\n\nTotal Adjusted: 4,905,600\n\nRyan Cohen as an insider placed several orders for a total of 1.2 million shares (4.9 million Post-Split) **in the middle of the Authorized Participants' and Market Maker's 13 Consecutive Settlement day period.**\n\nAfter being confronted with yet *another* massive buy order and even more purchases flowing in causing far too many FTDs to handle, **it is my speculative opinion that the Authorized Participants and the Market Maker approached their clearing house, Apex Clearing, and possibly even the SEC directly to appeal for more time to handle the situation.**\n\n**I can offer zero proof for this claim; however, it is the only current method I can think of that would buy them additional time past their consecutive 13 settlement days.** If any of you in the comments knows of *another* method to extend the 13 settlement day period for RegSHO Threshold Securities, **please let me know in the comments.**\n\nRegardless of if there was a meeting called, Ryan Cohen's purchase hit the market at the end of the maximum allotted FTD Settlement Period Limit T+35. January 21st and January 22nd, millions of FTDs were settled in a very short period of time, rocketing the share price up and pushing 10s of thousands of calls ITM.\n\nThe gamma ramp was lit and the price was rising far too fast for the Market Maker to control it on it's own. **Remember that only a Market Maker can naked short while the security is on the Threshold List. It is the special child and right now, the ONLY child that can try and stop this.**\n\nIn the middle of this constant rise, at some point the SEC and Apex clearing is *It is* pressuring the Authorized Participants and the Market Maker to begin closing their FTDs. They **need** Gamestop off of the threshold list.\n\nThe gamma ramp receives ignition as Authorized Participants FTDs begin to settle more and more FTDs causing the price to shoot up well above $100. At this point, many **small players** that had short positions are margin called and are forced to buy the underlying **immediately**. **It is my opinion that this combination of a gamma squeeze into a** ***partial*** **short squeeze ignited the Sneeze in January 2021.**\n\nSource: The SEC Gamestop Staff Report Page 25 & 26. Specifically on the question of \"How much of the January 2021 Price Action Caused by a \"Short Squeeze.\" : [https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf)\n\n>\n\nIn seeking to answer this question, staff observed that during some discrete periods, GME had sharp price increases concurrently with known major short sellers covering their short positions after incurring significant losses. During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME\u2019s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period.\n\nPlease bear in mind, **I am not trying to call the Sneeze a true Short Squeeze.** I personally believe that the players that *were* margin called were on the **smaller side**, as they must not have had the margin required to handle this movement **and** **couldn't allocate additional margin to cover.**\n\n**It is my personal conclusion that the January 2021 Gamestop price action was caused by a multitude of factors:**\n\n1. The extremely low price of Gamestop's stock enticed large investors to consider the possibility of opening new positions in the stock.\n2. Public announcements regarding a new massive investor by the name of Ryan Cohen publicly announcing a very large stake in the company and even communicating with the Board directly.\n3. Ryan Cohen's, *RC Ventures LLC*, and thousands of investors small, medium, and large taking advantage of the low Gamestop prices on an uptrend to enter into a possible retail turnaround.\n4. Market Maker's ability to delay settlement of purchases by T+35 AKA Naked Shorting caused Gamestop's stock to rise at a **much** slower rate than real price discovery would have allowed. This caused investors to purchase substantially larger holdings in the company than they otherwise would have been able to.\n5. Naked Shorting by Authorized Participants and Gamestop's Market Maker quickly exceeded the threshold limit of .5% of the company's outstanding shares, causing the stock to be placed on the Threshold Security list, restricting Authorized Participants from continuing to naked short **(excluding the Market Maker)** and forcing them to clear all FTDs by the 13th consecutive settlement day **(including the Market Maker.)**\n6. Ryan Cohen/*RC Venture LLC*'s purchases on 12/17 and 12/18 MAY have sparked an emergency order by the SEC to extend the Market Maker's and possibly the Authorized Participant's Threshold Security settlement deadline. The order of 1,226,400 shares(4,905,600 Post-Split) may have caused far too many FTDs for Market Makers to settle before the 13th consecutive settlement day without exploding the stock price.\n7. T+35 days after Ryan Cohen/*RC Venture LLC*'s purchases on 12/17 and 12/18, millions of FTDs are settled and Gamestop's stock price increases drastically, placing 10's of thousands of call options ITM.\n8. The SEC and clearing house, Apex Clearing, pressures the Authorized Participants and the Market Maker to close any remaining FTDs they have not yet settled. Gamestop **must** leave the Security Threshold list.\n9. As Authorized Participants and the Market Maker settle FTDs, a Gamma squeeze ignites and pushes the stock price above $100(Pre-Split). The next day, **smaller** institutions would be margin called and those that were unable to meet margin requirements were **forced to buy the underlying, driving the price higher.**\n10. With FTDs still being settled and some short positions being squeezed, the stock price visibly made it above $480 (Pre-Split). **Some partial orders were filled in the thousands; however, historical chart data does not allow us to see these prices.**\n\nImmediately following the historic rise of Gamestop's price on 1/28/2021 and 1/29/2021, Apex Clearing *\"\"encountered an issue\"\"* that caused Gamestop stock to be placed under \"Position Close Only\" for the vast majority of US and overseas brokers. A mass sell off of options and shares occurred as retail and institutional investors took profits. **During this sell off, the Market Maker utilized it's special privileges to naked short any buy orders that were still able to come in.**\n\nThe price of the stock dropped to it's new floor $40 ($10 Post-Split). The Market Maker had succeeded in lowering the new floor of the stock to a much more *manageable* level than what would be expected from an FTD settlement + partial short squeeze. During this mass sell off, Authorized Participants and the Market Maker were able to use the intense downward pressure to clear all remaining FTDs by end of day 2/04/2021.\n\nRetail would later see the results of the created FTDs from the trading week of January 18th and the trading week of February 1st settle through 2/24/2021 to 3/10/2021, causing the price to rocket back into the hundreds.\n\nGamestop would not be placed on RegSHO's Threshold Security list again (to my knowledge).\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Gamestop and several other stocks historically and currently are being Naked Shorted via Authorized Participants' abuse of share creation via the ETF XRT and possibly others.**\n\n**Gamestop's Market Maker is abusing their T+35 Calendar Day Settlement Period Limit Extension and are illegally using it as a \"Credit Line\" to delay the vast majority of purchases until a later date, thereby taking advantage of price drops to fill shares at lower prices than they were purchased for.**\n\n**Gamestop's day-to-day price action is the combination of Gamestop Investor's past purchases not being settled in the** ***present*** **and instead affecting the price 35 days into the** ***future*** **while the Market Maker's and Authorized Participant's Naked Shorts the stock in the present.**\n\n**A dark cloud of Failure-To-Delivers hangs over Gamestop in a rolling 35 day period, causing unusual price action that, for a time, seemed random. This cloud of FTDs prevents price discovery and is Illegal Market Manipulation by way of Gamestop's Market Maker abusing their privilege to fail to locate a share for T+35 Calendar Days.**\n\n**After the recent 75 million share offering, Gamestop's 2024 Outstanding Share Count should be 426,217,517 shares.

            "What they are primarily doing is an 'FTD' in that they aren't delivering the share but they absolutely do not want to get hit with the FTD label every time they fail a trade because it gets regulator attention. FTDs are a tiny slice of a broader issue, like a master juggler with many arms and perfectly transparent objects, you only see the juggled objects when he drops them (FTDs). The juggler working alone has a limited capacity, but with two they can fulfill the other's settlement obligations by passing new fails off as the settlement for the previous fail. This is extremely easy if you have two brokers helping each other as they each can satisfy the fails on the other's books by passing shares between themselves. Basically wash trading but at the settlement layer instead of on exchange. This problem becomes even easier to do the more brokers you rope into it, working together as a team their carrying capacity for failed trades increases by a lot. \n\nFor these brokers letting it FTD on the stock itself rather than on an ETF is what they do when everything else that they have gets blown out of the water and they can't handle the trades anymore, it's a last resort tactic with delayed but stringent clearing rules and that's why it affects the price.\n\n>At ANY time, Gamestop could have well over 2.13 MILLION SHARES SOLD NAKED SHORT\n\nIt's a matter of scale, and while yes they aren't going to permanetly fail more than ~2 million shares if they can help it to avoid regsho, this is absolutely not about something like 2 million shares. They literally wouldn't care at all if they only had 2 million shares short this way. They're not really even shorting (naked or otherwise) based on the SEC's terminology for that word, it's clearing failures that are not quite reaching FTD threshold because they keep resetting them in perpetuity.",

Sridharan\n\n\n\u201cIn a noisy rational expectations framework with costly information, some agents expend resources to become informed, and earn a return for their efforts by trading with the uninformed. Applying this insight, we examine the proposition that an increase in ETF ownership is accompanied by a decline in pricing efficiency for the underlying component securities. Our tests show an increase in ETF ownership is associated with: (1) higher trading costs (measured as bid-ask spreads and price impact of trades); (2) an increase in \"stock return synchronicity\" (measured as the co-movement of firm-level stock returns with general market and related-industry stock returns); (3) a decline in \"future earnings response coefficients\" (measured as the predictive power of current returns for future earnings), and (4) a decline in the number of analysts covering the firm. Collectively, our findings support the view that increased ETF ownership can lead to higher trading costs and lower benefits from information acquisition, a combination which results in less informative security prices for the component firms.\u201d",

We demonstrate that such ETFs also have the potential to alter the informational efficiency of underlying markets and introduce fragility via herding. Specifically, while these ETFs bring more information to the markets at the aggregate level, individual asset prices may face persistent dislocations. We also show that such ETFs can exacerbate herding, where speculators across markets trade similarly, unhinged from fundamental value. All results arise from the distinct characteristics of inter-market learning in ETFs on hard-to-access underlying settings.",
