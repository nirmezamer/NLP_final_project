I play on pc so that\u2019s a factor btw as to what I can actually play.\n\nI hear the gta games other than gta 5 are also really good but I\u2019ve yet to play them. Are all of them open world as well?\n",

            "The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and BG3 my last 3 favourite open world games.",
            "For me, Cyberpunk 2077 has one of the best open worlds because Night City is relatively small but super dense. This means that you don\u2019t really feel the need to fast travel very often, and usually you can opt to drive to your destination. That means basically no loading screens, and it really helps your immersion.",
            "Kingdom come deliverance",
            "Days gone and Ghost of Tsushima are two of my favorite open world games of all time.",
            "Assassins Creed Odyssey is great. It\u2019s a huge world full of stuff. Kassandra is one of my all time favorite game protagonists. \n\nA few open workd games that are really fun and you can usually find on sale cheap are Saints Row the Third, Mad Max, and sleeping dogs. \n\nIf you like super heroes Spider-man and Arkham City are excellent. \n\nA few others I\u2019ve enjoyed: Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, immortals Fenyx Rising, Metal Gear Solid V, and Ghosts of Tsushima,",
            "I've played a lot of open world games, it's probably my second most played genre below RPGs. The games you mentioned are the pinnacle of open world gaming so any game I mention probably won't be on the same level of quality but I'm going to list my top 5 open world games excluding RDR2 and tell you why I enjoyed them so much  so you can see if you'd be interested. \n\n5. Assassin's Creed Valhalla\nThis is pretty much all I've ever wanted from a viking open world arpg. It has great story arcs, a beautiful and immersing open world that's massive with tons of unique things to do, fun combat and rpg elements that allow you to create different builds and ways to play, and an amazing soundtrack that's as authentic as ever to the Norse setting, with the likes of Einar Selvik taking part in creating the music. Only flaw this game has is it's length which may be an issue depending on how long you like your games. The main story is roughly 80 hours long.\n\n4. Elden Ring\nThis game has a beautiful but brutal world inhabited by dangerous enemies, bosses, and npcs. A lot of what makes Elden Ring so good is the lack of handholding and sense of exploration, discovery, and freedom that comes with that. In Elden Ring you are thrown into a huge map without being told anything. It is your job to find things out through interaction with npcs that are all extremely vague, and simply exploring the world. Finding things in elden ring is a very rewarding feeling, and overcoming challenges is the best part. The role playing elements in this game are the best out of any of these games, as you can really find a playstyle for you no matter who you are with how many weapons, spells, incantations, and armors are available for you to test.\n\n3. The Witcher 3\nThe world of the witcher 3 is beautiful and it speaks for itself. Every region is vastly different from the next. The story is fantastic and while the choice making isn't as deep as it seems, the game will have you caring for the characters deeply. The world is filled with captivating side quests, secrets to uncover, and dangerous foes.\n\n2. Cyberpunk 2077\nThis game has the most unique world out of the 5 I've listed here. It's beautiful in it's own way, with the bustling Night City with neon lights, tall towering buildings, and streets filled with cars and people. It feels the most alive as well, with random events happening throughout Night City such as gang wars, police shootouts, and crime scenes scattered throughout. It's as dangerous as it is captivating. All of this is highlighted by the game's incredible graphics, making every surface feel real. The story is thrilling, the combat is exhilarating and action packed. Despite Cyberpunk's disastrous launch, the game has now very much redeemed itself and much more.\n\n1.  Skyrim\nSomething about Skyrim makes it so special. It's not graphically advanced, (no where near the other games on this list) the combat is clunky, and animations feel robotic. Yet the world still manages to feel so special, and cements it self as one of the best in gaming nearly 2 decades later. It's vast and expansive, and the game perfects the sense of exploration that is is so needed in modern open worlds. The story and lore are so deep and actually requires you to immerse yourself in the world to absorb it. The rpg elements actually hold up very well, with the whole skill tree system and progression feeling quite rewarding.  Despite Skyrim's dated graphics, the game captures another level of beauty not present in many realistic AAA titles. The soundtrack is honestly flawless, from the epic main menu theme to the calming ambience of Secunda.",
            "Far cry 5. Huge map with tons to do. I loved the story too.",
            "The world of Ghost Recon Wildlands is surprisingly good. The [map](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7610245/19_GRW_SCREENSHOT_4K_map_enviros.png.png) is amazing, lots of different [regions](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7610229/20_GRW_SCREENSHOT_4K_OpenWorld.png) to explore, and the whole world is really well designed. There are planes and helicopters to use to cover long distances and it all feels really well crafted and worth exploring. Definitely one of my most favourite open worlds and it's a pretty good game overall.",
            "I'm playing Ghost of Tsushima right now on PC and it's amazing.\n\nI would also suggest Elden Ring if you're into difficult games, especially with the release of the DLC today it's the perfect time to jump into it.\n\nAnd I can't recommend Kingdom Come Deliverance enough if you're a fan of European history!",
            "Horizon series are the best games I've played in my life (haven't played some of the big names though). Absolute gold",
            "Lego Lord of the Rings. I enjoyed playing it from beginning to end. And thinking it was going to end several times before it actually did lol. Graphics and atmosphere are pretty good too for an older game.\n\nMad Max, Batman: Arkham quadrilogy, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor/War.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V is pretty good. After the 1hr playable intro... It is - unique though. Controls take a bit of getting used to and the story is weird, but fantastic covert military sim gameplay. I felt pretty immersed when I played it. Vehicle mechanics are abysmal, but can lead to some fun and hilarious events. Graphics are amazing, sprawling game world. Just as a forewarning though, mission ranking is based on speed, not stealth. Took me a while to realize why I kept getting poor rankings. But there are mods that change it to be more stealth oriented.\n\nIf you want to go all out and like grinding (which is somewhat lessened if you just follow the Atlas or Core main quests), could try No Man's Sky.\n\nOn the same note, and still grindy (gather, craft, build, survive, explore), Subnautica and The Planet Crafter are great.",
            "Elden Ring is really great if you\u2019re into that kind of fantasy at all. Imo the game is bigger than it needs to be, but ymmv and you can always just skip some side content, or leave it for a second playthrough with a different build to keep things interesting. Apparently the dlc is massive as well. I don\u2019t know how well those games play with kbm though, if you have a controller that\u2019s definitely the standard way to play.",
            "Enderal\n\nMorrowind with Tamriel Rebuilt mod",
            "Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic, surprised nobody else has said that.",
            "The Call of the Wild games, theHunter and The Angler. It\u2019s insane to me that these stunning open worlds are not considered alongside AAA games.",
            "Skyrim, excellent open world. Has my favorite game atmosphere",
            "Try Elden Ring, Death Stranding and The Witcher 3",
            "It\u2019s time for you to become an Elden Lord (play Elden Ring, don\u2019t read about it or watch too much on yt)",
            "Skyrim is always my go to.",
            "Cyberpunk 2077 is my personal favorite. Witcher 3 is up there too but I preferred Cyberpunks gameplay.\n\nElden Ring is probably the consensus answer though",
            "Skyrim",
            "Elden Ring and Ghost of Tsushima would be my recommendations",
            "Elden Ring, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, and maybe Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind, Cyberpunk, Just Cause 3. I also enjoyed the Spiderman games",
            "Just started playing Ghost Recon: Wildlands and it's one of the best open worlds I've seen in awhile",
            "GTA and RDR are non-fantasy open world games, so if you don\u2019t like fantasy/unrealistic open worlds, then I am afraid you don\u2019t have much options, besides maybe Just Cause or Far Cry series. If fantasy is OK, then so many recommendations including Elden Ring, Skyrim (but outdated now unless you want to mod it), The Witcher 3, CP2077, Spider-Man, Borderlands 2&3, Horizon ZD/FW, etc\u2026",
            "So the thing that makes Rockstar open worlds so amazing is their dynamic nature. You go from point A to point B, and you never know what's going to happen along the way.\n\nI too have been searching for other games like that. So far, the only ones that even kind of capture that feeling are Bethesda games, the elder scrolls in particular, and Dragons Dogma.\n\nIf you do manage to find any others, I'd love to hear about them. But in my experience, 99% of what you're going to be recommended are going to be very story or action driven games that fail completely in nailing the dynamic nature of their worlds. People are going to recommend the witcher or elden ring. Those games are not dynamic open worlds.",
            "Another vote for cyberpunk 2077.. just remember to take your time and enjoy night city and enjoy all of the amazing side content.  God I love that game",
            "Ni No Kuni Wrath Of The White Witch, outside of teh quests you can freely roam the open world.  \nIf you enjoy studio ghibli movies you will love this game, even better if you enjoy pokemon style monster collecting :D",

            "Horizon zero dawn and horizon forbidden west.  They are amazing",
            "Elden Ring is the best.\n\nIt's not as story \"focused\" but there is one. Its just more ... hidden away. the gameplay, combat, sense of exploration, secrets etc. is what makes this my favorite game. (2nd favorite of all time, just after Bloodborne)",
            "Elden ring and it's not even close. The witcher 3 is pretty great too. Red dead is great and all but im just not looking to play a cowboy simulator. I like killing monsters lol",
            "Just play Elden Ring. A new DLC released so, yeah. I have put almost 70 hours into it and have yet to finish it lol.\n\nJust be ready for some extremely hard fights if you've never played soul's games before (like me)",
            "I would suggest Elden Ring if you enjoy playing with your controller in one hand and a guide in the other lol. It\u2019s incredibly overhyped imo. The lack of a journal and quest markers hinders gameplay drastically. \n\nI would recommend Baldurs Gate 3, Skyrim (for the casual gamer, Morrowind and Oblivion are more complex in their mechanics), Assassin\u2019s Creed Black Flag, Fallout(3, NV, 4, and then 76 for the best experience, same for Elder Scrolls), and Far Cry.\n\nGhost of Tsushima is also amazing. It\u2019s tied with Sekiro for my 2nd favorite game of all time.",

            "Watch dogs franchise",

            "How about open galaxy? Try elite: dangerous and play in a 1:1 scale, fully exploraable milky way galaxy.",
            "In more recent times, definitely ghost of, Tsushima, and horizon zero dawn",
            "You can never go wrong with the classic: Fallout 1 and 2",
            "An underrated gem in sleeping dogs. Really solid open world game",
            "Fallout 3 onward, as well as Elder Scrolls 3 onward",
            "Absolutely loving Kingdom Come Deliverance and I\u2019m generally not a big open world guy. Another exception is Death Stranding. Love that game",
            "I had a great time with Days Gone, great zombie open world shooter.",
            "Valheim. It is an open world, survival, base-building game. Viking Minecraft. Each seed is procedurally generated, which means the map will be different in every playthrough!\n\nThe game currently has 7 completes biomes, with 1 or 2 more to come. It\u2019s been in early access since Feb 2021, but it plays amazing. Super well balanced. And you can do so much with it! You can travel by foot and by boat (I won\u2019t spoil anymore).\n\nIt\u2019s many games in one: exploration, crafting, farming, combat. You can play as fast or as slow as you want. (I play extremely slow, hoping to cover the whole map, which is MASSIVE.) You unlock recipes over time, and can level up a lot of different ways. The soundtrack is amazing.\n\nI\u2019m 700hr in and I tell friends I\u2019ll be playing this game for the next ten years. I know streamers who are at 5000hr plus. You can play solo offline, or multiplayer with friends.\n\nIt\u2019s cheap, too. Pay once; no DLC\u2019s; tons of mods, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. This game is INCREDIBLE value for money. I love it so much.",
            "Some of my favorites is Ghosts of Tsushima, Marvel's Spiderman Remastered, Assassin's creed 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, and Black Flag. My favorite of all time goes to Elden Ring no doubt.",

            "Sleeping Dogs. Fantastic melee combat, excellent story, lots of side missions and DLC, boatloads of content. \n\nSaints Row IV, pretty good story, characters are great, decent humor, actual superpowers, big amount of varied weapons and weapon types, etc. it's such a good game.",
            "Horizon forbidden west is the single most overhated game I know\u2026 \n\n\nPlaying Elden ring right now, but horizon is still my 2022 goty. Both are amazing games but horizon edges it out for me. Elden ring might not be the type of game you\u2019re looking for. \n\n\nCyberpunk is also phenomenal, one of my favorite games from 2020.",
            "This is a pretty old one but Saints Row 2. Saints Row 2 was rhe perfect combo of crazy, and actually having a story that made sense. \n\nIt was like a San Andreas copy and paste job.",

            "Sleeping Dogs is great",
            "Watch dogs 1 & 2 are really good. Saints row 1-3 are all solid as well",
            "Not super similar to those two, but my last fav open world games are Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild & TOTK, and the Horizon games.",
            "I'm surprised I haven't seen this one in the comments yet. Just Cause. It's an open world fuck around and blow stuff up kinda game. Lots of random shit, easter eggs, bases to invade, races, and diverse terrain. Personally, I think the second installment is the strongest for various open world aspects, but I've heard just cause 4 also has really good gameplay.",
            "Witcher 3 and Elden Ring take the cake for open world imo",
            "RDR2, Jedi survivor, Fallout 4, cyberpunk",
            "Not recent but Saints Row 2 is great, has the best open world out of the Saints Row franchise IMO.",

            "Witcher 3 is my favourite open world game ever. \n\nAssassins Creed Origins due to the pyramids over Odyssey. \n\nSubnautica is an open world in the sea on an alien planet and there\u2019s nothing else like it. \n\nFor a couple of older games Skyrim and GTA Sanandreas remastered since you mentioned GTA",
            "the **watch dogs** series.\n\nthe first one is kinda a serious game, you play as a vigilante hacker who can stop bad guy using wits and cool gadgets. basically like batman.\n\nthe second one is kinda light hearted and comedic, you play as this one goofy hacker. there are tons of modern references.\n\nthe third one is... meh, but the DLC was worth it. you can play as the first game's hero, but he is already old.\n\nthe online pvp in the first two games is also great. which is basically hide and seek. you need to hide while trying to hack (not actually hacking) the other players, and the other players try to find you and kill you. well, providing the players wouldnt quit halfway.",

            "The last 2 God of War.",
            "For me it was Skyrim when I started playing it. There's just so many fricking places for discover. So many quests you pick up randomly and random encounters. It was the first game I really felt I was in an open world. Now when I play GTA 5 the world looks so dead to me.",
            "My favorites are Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. \n\nIf you\u2019re open to some older games I also really enjoyed Fallout: New Vegas and Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag.",

            "Not a lot of people saying Hogwarts Legacy, wow. \n\n\nDefinitely HL, Ive been playing it now for 35hrs and Id say im 40% complete. I am oddly satisfied with this game. Theres so much to do in the world. Hogwarts castle is outstanding, full of collectible, side quest, treasures and hidden passageways. \n\nThen there\u2019s the rest of the map, forest, prairies, rivers, lakes, little towns, big towns, destroyed castles, camps of bad guys.\n\nThe most fun part is getting on a broom and just flaying around every 5 feet there\u2019s something to do, or watch as the world is so interesting.\n\n\nI strongly recommend this game. You will not be disappointed.\n\n\nI have played RDR, RDR2, GTAIV, GTAV, Skyrim, AC Black Flag, Sleeping Dogs, Dead Island. Pretty much a lot of open world games.",

You grow a stone age village and an old man with one arm will piss on you at some point.",

And it just makes every discovery that much more rewarding because of it.",

            "people hate it because nintendo and the fact that it's a switch exclusive make it less attractive to most people. very unfortunate",
            "It's probably not worth mentioning Zelda Open World games here because they are far ahead of their time.",
            "100% yes for pure fun. I\u2019d even say Just Cause 4 if you can handle a bit of jank cause that game is the best sandbox out of all of them (doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best just cause \u201cgame\u201d per say) but you can do the most dicking around with all the grapple mods",
            "Do you feel like you\u2019re exploring an open world in BG3 though?",
            "Hmm I guess it's not a true open world, but the exploration is amazing. You discover tons of stuff when you 100% each map. Loved it",
            "While it might seem the zones to explore are small, everything is so much packed with details, with so many hidden places, so many alternatives routes, so many things to find that the sense of reward coming from exploration is actually insane",
            "Disagree. I love open world games, and while I think the story of cyberpunk and also the combat is great, I didn't find exploring around fun.",
            "It is, but compared to other \u201copen world\u201d maps like Fallout 76 or AC Odyssey it\u2019s relatively small. But it makes up for it in density and level of immersion. FO76 is particularly egregious because there aren\u2019t any mounts or vehicles and the fact that a lot of the map is empty.",
            "I don\u2019t know about that. Bethesda had a lot of hold on the gaming industry aside from The Elder Scrolls. They also have Fallout and ID\u2019s Doom. Those three alone having no bad mainline games hold a lot of power.",

            "It honestly feels slow at first but gets better. I honestly enjoyed it from the beginning till the end so you have to decide if you wanna give it another try or just try something else that you may enjoy . I couldn't get into horizon as well so I just stopped it.",
            "I recently completed playing Days Gone, and I must say I had a really positive impression of the game. It effectively combines elements from Red Dead Redemption and The Last of Us, resulting in an enjoyable experience.",
            "I think it's a genre because it's the only type of game that allows you to completely freely explore. That's pretty much the defining factor of it.",
            "Thanks man, appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f",
            "That's definitely fair, both are pretty good but in my opinion Black Flag didn't really have a good sense of progression. And the world didn't feel empty but it was massively stretched out by the ocean. Plus, there could've been more secrets hidden on the secluded islands you can explore. I remember just sailing and I see a small island. I go to explore it and nothing was there. If it was any other game like valhalla treasure would have been added.",
            "Thanks! Honestly I probably should've added Fallout 4 but I haven't played enough of it to decide yet. And Cyberpunk 2077 is actually so good it's insane. It takes it spot in my top 10 games of all time alongside RDR2 and The Last Of Us.",
            "God Of War is not an open world game...",
            "Definitely, you can grab the game for cheap and on sale it's a no-brainer. At least in my opinion. I'm just checking the pricing and it's sold for $10 right now, Humble Bundle. It all comes down to what you like of course, but if you like the idea of a tactical shooter in Bolivia, I'd give it a try. Me and my friends are highly critical, even more so when it comes to Ubisoft, and we all liked the game a lot (interestingly, we didn't like the next Ghost Recon, Breakpoint). Wildlands is not a perfect game, but I believe a lot of the criticism has to do with how people approach it. The side missions are repetitive, but you don't have to complete them, there's plenty of content to keep you hooked. The game is also highly customizable and I never really played it as it's usually played, with default HUD, dynamic markers etc. I opted for higher difficulty and absolutely minimal HUD, which makes the game much more tactical and 'realistic' because it encourages recon etc.",
            "The gameplay is the best part. That\u2019s the entire concept. It\u2019s a modern military sandbox with tons of gear to collect.",
            "Great game. Fun solo or with buddies.",
            "You are repetitive",
            "Such a fun game. (Except for the Mary Jane missions of course) (and those are alright)",
            "Graphics hold up well imo and I played it for the first time this year so I\u2019m not biased",
            "Do you get quests from NPCs? Or do you literally have to write notes with a pen and paper to find some item x they ask you to go find? I know little about Elden ring",

            "For new players, it is pretty damn hard. Actually uninstalled it the first time as I was so frustrated by dying so much, but then I installed it a few months back and now I am 70 hours in (havent completed it yet :D)\n\nImo, if you get past the first boss things will start to go smoother. Of course, there is so many easier things to fight aswell to get you prepared so go explore.\n\nI would definitely recommend it though.",
            "It\u2019s easier than Demon\u2019s Souls but if the act of dying a lot is itself a barrier to you enjoying the game then it might still not be for you \n\nIn ER you have many more opportunities to go somewhere else do a different castle face a different boss if you get stuck somewhere, level up, get new items/better summons so you can go back and kick that boss\u2019 ass finally \n\nThat said, you\u2019ll still die a lot, so if that still bothers you then I\u2019d get it on a deep sale or wait for a free weekend or something.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u2019incredibly hard\u2019 I think generally it\u2019s the easiest of fromsoftware\u2019s offerings it\u2019s certainly doable and very much one of those games that you get back double what you put into it if that makes sense",
            "I started enjoying Elden ring when I defeated the first boss after dozens of tries. The sense of accomplishment I felt overcoming such a hard boss was such a rush I was literally screaming at 1 in the morning (sorry neighbors)",
            "It's annoying how hard it is.",
            "well cant blame them, especially after iwata",
            "jc4 just felt ass to me, not that interesting tbh",
            "I think so, maybe not in the traditional sense but a game you can have multiple play throughs with different endings I think offers the variety of an open world game. Hell I didn\u2019t even meet a lot of the npcs you can add to your party on my first play through",
            "Nice! Gonna have to check it out",
            "Really?!?! Ok ) Which open world you liked the most?",
            "You also have to consider those open world maps are mostly countryside with some urban sprawl sprinkled in.\n\nDespite being able to occlude more geometry, and theoretically improving performance as a result, you almost never see videogame cities as large as Night City. I believe Vice City and surrounding towns will be larger, however.\n\nThat said, yes, you are correct in terms of overall map. Ubisoft in particular has been pushing massive map sizes since the last gen. Heck, every AC game is now set in an entire country (Egypt, Greece, England, and now Japan)\n\nHowever, there is something to be said about negative space in a video game world. I do remember the reaction to Unity\u2019s icon overload. It\u2019s okay to have space and not cram everything humanely possible into a map.",
            "Yeah cant wait, did full negative perks hardcore run 1 week ago",
            "I have both yet did not feel this at all.",
            "Whats is your favorite games genre? \"Its open world\".\nLike Gta open world skyrim open world or minecraft open world?",
            "Ragnarok is close enough and better in every single metric",
            "Good to know I will give it a try then!",
            "In Elden Ring the NPC quests are incredibly unintuitive. Not sure if making notes is even worth it when you might just not run into them in the first place lol.",
            "Both of your replies makes me scared to spend money on the game, even though the game seems quite interesting\u2026 Getting my ass handed to me in video games really is not my thing lol",
            "A lot of people think that, that\u2019s why I just said it\u2019s the best sandbox. It\u2019s the one I personally gravitate to for just fun dicking around since there\u2019s just more then both Just Cause 2 and 3. As for the game side of it, Just Cause 3 story and liberation is incredible and the only giant disappointment of 4 imo, besides some jank",
            "I have over 800 hours in BG3 and still discover new stuff. The game is absolutely phenomenal!",
            "Mmh.. Skyrim, AC:Odyssey, Witcher 3... But those are very different games. Yet, even talking about more similar worlds, I think any GTA game or even watch dogs games have more interesting worlds. In those games I liked just driving around it felt more.... I don't know, open, free. In cyberpunk I feel less free driving around for some reason, I also encounter less... Landmarks that make me know the map.\n\nI can't really explain why, but while I liked the game for other aspects, I didn't enjoy just roaming around so much as in other games for some reason. I focused more on doing missions",
            "Yeah it's kind of like a big umbrella genre. All those games have the exploring factor in common tho.",
            "Ragnarok is literally not an open world video game. It is open zone. And yes it's a better game than valhalla I agree with that, but it's not an open world game and that's widely agreed upon by the community. OP asked for open world games with similar world to RDR2 and GTA 5. Go on any news outlet and search up \"Is God Of War Ragnarok an open world game?\" The answer you'll get on everything is that it's not true open world and it's still a linear experience. It may be more open than GoW 2018 but still no where near a traditional open world. You can't go anywhere you want in the game. The zones you go to follow the story order. It's more like Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne than Elden Ring",
            "You can basically farm your way to making the game not very difficult. There\u2019s summons and co-op that can make boss fights trivial. You\u2019ll still die a lot but there are weapons and items that can make the game almost too easy. They nerfed the Blasphemous blade when the DLC dropped but you can still pretty much hit L2 to beat the entire end game with it.",
            "The game is hard if you\u2019re playing it the \u00ab\u00a0internet certified real gamer\u00a0\u00bb way, meaning running at enemies alone with a hand on a war hammer and the other hand on your dick. In reality, the game has plenty of ways of making it easier for a casual player, such as being able to summon familiars that fight with you and take the aggro of bosses, summoning NPCs to help you fight major bosses or even summoning other players to help you (there\u2019s no in game chat so no toxicity, you can think of it as really strong NPCs helping you). There\u2019s also plenty of OP weapons that make the experience easier. Some sweaty nerds will criticize you for using these methods because \u00ab\u00a0ermmm you\u2019re not acshually playing the game properly, you need to beat the game with a wooden club and no armor or why bother playing\u00a0\u00bb but it\u2019s a mostly single player game so who cares",
            "I\u2019ve been playing FromSoft games since before Demon\u2019s Souls came out on the PS3 and I can tell you for certain that Elden Ring is the easiest and most beginner friendly Souls game to get into. Definitely easier than Demon\u2019s Souls except for the bosses, which are harder/better in ER.\n\nIf you get stuck, there are plenty of easier areas to go explore, get quick experience and maybe some new gear. If that doesn\u2019t help you, you can summon beasts of different varieties to help you in battle. If it is still a bit too hard at times, you can summon other players (multiple at once) who have to help you beat bosses. Utilizing all three of those will make you get through the game for sure.",
            "Thanks!",
            "You got a point there.\nActually i dont wanted to argument bout that. Because it really doesnt matter how you call it! But sometimes maybe too often, the little german in me forces me to smartass about some stuff...",

I'm making this list so that OP can take a look at it and find a new open world game they may enjoy. OP asked for OPEN WORLD games, not SEMI-OPEN. On top of that, I'm not changing my list because you hate Assassin's Creed. Respect my opinion as I respect yours. I don't really know who you think you are that you can tell somebody else how to feel about a video game they like. You can hate Assassin's Creed. That's OK. I personally love the series and all the games. It's called an opinion. I tried being logical and tolerated your arrogance first response but it only got worse.",
