At least, that's how it went for me. First playthrough DSe SoC took like 12 tries, but 2nd-4th runs it only took an average of 3 to 5 tries to win. Godfrey always only ever took two tries in Elden Ring, he's definitely the biggest pushover of the bosses I listed.\n\nIt's just a matter of studying his attack patterns, being careful, and being careful specifically about when you heal, or he will punish you almost immediately. Once you learn how to dodge and get a time window to heal, then hit him without getting hit yourself, just execute/perform and you'll have this, man! \n\nBe careful, you *immediately* begin new game plus as soon as you defeat him, there isn't an option, it just happens regardless. Be ready to start the game over. If you have some upgrading or farming to do, might want to get it out of the way. Shouldn't take too long to potentially get the Lord vessel again to warp around and collect all the resources you could ever need once again, so you're not totally screwed if you start ng+ right away without meaning to.",

It's similar to Nashandra in DKS2, my problem with her on the other hand, is the limited moves she has, it's kinda boring and could have been much better.\n\nGwyn certainly suffered from being in the second half of the game, because as Miyazaki said in an interview, Gwyn wasn't supposed to be easy at all, he wanted him to be the greatest challenge in the game, but sadly he isn't. I was utterly disappointed that in the remastered they didn't use the opportunity to make him harder.",
            "I never parried either. Hadn't learned it and was too lazy to start at the end. The difficulty comes from him not letting you take a break. Ever. So you don't start having dirty thoughts about drinking Estus or smth.",

I either block, attack or dodge. Never parry. I\u2019m not wasting effort learning every enemies timings when I could just simply get out of the way or block instead. \n\nIt\u2019s like you said; more fun.

The entry that is most similar in terms of tempo and reactiveness is ds3, so going from ER to ds3 if you do it in that order shouldn't feel as jarring as going back to ds1. Personally I would say skip ds2 and keep it for doing a completionist catalogue. I say this because I don't think there's anything really to take away from ds2 that will benefit you in ER, unlike ds1 and ds3; and since the ER story is a fresh IP you won't be missing out on any relevant lore details. Ds2 has its moments but always felt out of place for me. the art direction isn't Miyazaki's, the game design isn't Miyazaki's, the story isn't Miyazaki's; the game somehow looks and feels older and clunkier than ds1 without making up for it with distinct art, story or level design (the latter being notoriously worse than the other souls entries). Ds2 was made by a secondary fromsoft team while the main crew started to work on Bloodborne (?) iirc, so it has minimal ties to what made the other entries good. In ds3 they basically went back to school with production and it is honestly still really enjoyable, I think you'll enjoy it a lot more than ds2",

            "So is demon firesage, if I recall correctly",
            "Actually I started DS2 SotFS an hour ago. I've just finished DSR today and it was such a lovely experience. But so far I don't like DS2 purely because the controls feel weird and inputs feel laggy. The game looks lovely but I REALLY wanna skip this for now. So you're saying if I go straight to DS3, I won't miss anything?",
            "but for gwynn, the only move that can't be parried is his slowass grab.",
            "DS1 parrying is incredibly easy tbh. Just parry every human sized enemy, and you'll be fine. Never have to worry if an attack can be parried or not.",
            "Which is the hidden one? The one on the ledge near the bone dogs? If so that is where I was running from and it was still vile \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "Stakes of Marika too, such a big improvement.",
            "Imagine how long it would take to learn malenia with a Frigid Outskirts length runback lol",
            "For BoC you need orange charred to get to her. You can seal once at her arena tho",
            "Going to be interesting in future play throughs now that they patched out BB knockdown",
            "DS3 and Bloodborne. Elden Ring is mostly fine in the first half and then you beat Morgott and the game becomes comically fucking stupid (and now the DLC is apparently even more fucking bullshit lmao, glad I was too poor to afford it) with deranged bosses like Maliketh, Fire Giant, Malenia, Elden Beast, etc. ER is clearly balanced around magic cheese and summons and it ruins the balance.",
            "R1 2h zwei literally stagger interrupts everything.",
            "I disagree, took him out easy as hell 2 handing my abyss greatsword.",
            "Not if you unlock the shortcut",
            "Sounds like you\u2019re just mad that they finally figured out how to punish roll spam in Elden Ring lol. Ohh nooo I have to actually learn attack timings ohhh noooo!",
            "Oh no a bloodborne glazer. Elden ring is great even without summons, just adapt to the play \nstyle",
            "While I do think Elden Ring has the weakest boss fights of all the souls games that I've played, the only one that's actually bullshit is Malenia.",
            "Yea that's true but if you're a new player you probably don't even utilize covenants. Plus then you have to give up thirty humanity on a whim",
            "Only you can't learn the timings because they can delay their attacks as they see fit. Not necessary agreeing with op, but being able to learn timings is something you could do really well in ds3, in eldenring it's mostly reaction based",
            "You can unlock it from the other side for free tho",
            "You can open it from behind without pay",
            "It\u2019s a mix of both because Elden Ring actually has some of the best designed bosses in the series from a difficulty perspective. Every attack that can be variably delayed has a tell, that if you\u2019re paying close enough attention, tells you when to dodge. Like Margit/Morgotts delayed overhead swing. Yes he can delay it as long as he wants, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re just guessing at when he swings. You can see his arm flex right before he attacks. Elden Ring just demands you pay more close attention to the attack animations than all the other games before it.",
            "That's what she said"
