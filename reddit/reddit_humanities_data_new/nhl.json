This includes posting a meme. If you want to post a picture, post the link to it. \n\n2) Don't editorialize titles.  A title should reflect what is in the link/thread.  A title of \"hilarious\" doesn't do so. \n\n3) No more pictures without any context.  Just posting a picture of an old player is low effort and will be removed. Again this includes memes.  \n\n4) No posts solely for the purpose of sexualizing players, fans, etc.....\n\n5) All Playoff Brackets at this link... https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1c84h3o/mod_announcement_all_playoff_brackets_and/\n\n6) It is bigotry and unacceptable to make fun of a religion in our comments. If it was judaism or Islam, you wouldn't do it and would expect to be banned. For some reason, some of the posters here think its okay to make fun of Mormons in the comments.  This is a reminder.... this violates rule 6 and will be an insta-ban. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/about/rules/\n\n7) Don't blame entire fanbases, troll them, or take shots at them.  Fanbases are diverse things and a few fans never represent all fans of a team.\n\n8) No, who should I cheer for posts.  Strangers on the internet don't pick your team.  Watch games, watch highlights, find the team you fall in love with.  Your team picks you, not strangers on the internet.",

They need a good head cleaning, day to woosah everything away, then remember that they're there for a reason and fully capable of winning one game and how that the crowd comes to life for game 7 and doesn't let up. \n\nThat or a Florida Man sized dose of meth right before the game.",
            "They seem to have gotten away from the game they play. That 8-1 loss seems to have shaken them badly. Against the rangers bob was outstanding, just like games 1-3. Since game 4 he hasn\u2019t been their savior so it looks like they are questioning everything.",

Florida can still show they can turn the momentum in an instant (Game 5 after going down 3-0), so Edmonton cannot rest lightly. They need to be relentless on the forecheck.

Edmonton fans can tell you that, it would still be a great final and they are happy with the teams resiliency and gusto, blah blah blah. The Edmonton players will not feel the same way. As Draisaitl said , cup or bust. The mission is not complete for either side. Gonna be a great game. Gonna come down to goaltending and special teams, imo. You can throw out the previous 6 games, they no longer mean anything. There is no \u201cpressure\u201d advantage as it is now equal on both sides. 1 win for the Stanley Cup.

Those people do not understand hockey or human nature. The new coach came in, they went on an epic win streak and qualified for the playoffs. That angry face was a man saying to himself that he will not allow his team to lose anymore. It was a promise he made to himself that he will turn things around. And, he did. Go Oilers!",

Even though the challenge has benefitted my team (Vancouver) as much as any other team, I think there are too many good goals disallowed.\n\nHere are the changes I would make to the rule.\n\n\\* Only review the offside in real time. If you can't tell a player is offside in real time it should be a good goal.\n\n\\* It should be a clear offside, like 1 to 2 feet offside, not millimeters like this disallowed goal.\n\n\\* An offside review should only be able to rewind the video 20 seconds. Any offside older than 20 seconds  Does Not Matter. All the defensive players will be back in the zone, and the puck will have changed possession numerous times, thus negating the advantage of an old offside.\n\nIn this case, even though I'm cheering for Edmonton, I would not have disallowed that goal. When it's that close the tie should go to the offensive player.\n\nFollowing the rules of the offside challenge, the goal should have been disallowed. I just think the rules need refining.",

            "So you basically, the puck MUST cross the last blue line before the first player does. It's to prevent teams from being able to just peace a man on the opposing zone abs drop him the puck at their leisure. It's called offside and had the same function as it does in football(soccer)",

            "The puck has to enter the offensive zone before any player on the attacking team.  \n\nIf the puck is cleared outside the blue line, everyone has to leave the zone and the puck has to again go in first. \n\nIt exists to stop players from \u201ccherry picking\u201d and just standing beside the other team\u2019s goalie. \n\nSo the entire puck needs to be in the zone. \n\nLook up the offside rule. \n\nIt\u2019s also a little nuanced because if you have possession of the puck, you could technically go in backwards and the puck goes in after you it\u2019s still considered onside.  But basically. Puck has to go in first.",
            "So for this instance in particular. Hit pause around the last 30 seconds. \n\nBasically one Florida player is ahead of the player with the puck. \n\nThe Florida player with the puck dekes towards his right side to get around the Edmonton players. \n\nThis delay of crossing and movement of the puck caused that other Florida player to cross the blue line before the puck does. \n\nThis is offsides. \n\nParticularly why this is called and can callback a goal is because an unfair advantage occurred (offsides) on the direct play/sequence that lead to a goal. \n\nSometimes the challenges on goals have occurred long after the original missed offsides, and the review and dismissal of a goal seem ridiculous. \n\nBut in this case, Florida crashes the blue line offsides and has the unfair advantage to crash the net scoring almost immediately. So yeah, penalty on the goal.",

They have to wait for the puck to cross the opposing blue line before they can. \n\nIt changes depending on the period and the home net location, but your goalie is behind the blue line in your defensive zone, the neutral zone is the middle of the ice between the two blue lines, and the other side of their blue line is your offensive zone. \n\nThose zones come into play for making line changes, penalties like offsides and icing, and faceoff locations.",
            "It was offside, the blue lines mark where each team\u2019s attacking and defending zones begin, and basically when you are attacking the puck has to make it past the line before any of the players do.

            "That is actually not dumb at all. If the player handling the puck were too turn around so they entered before the puck, that can also be considered offside. In that situation they are looking at total puck control. It doesn't happen often, but it has happened.",

            "That\u2019s just the basics of what happened. Florida entered the zone before the puck. \n\nAt least it wasn\u2019t those weird reviews that happened where zone time was 1:15 before a goal. \n\nLike those are ridiculous. At least in this instance, the ensuing goal occurred fairly quick after the missed penalty.",

            "Agreed, and the spirit of the penalty is to prevent cherry picking, which is does and if it\u2019s close enough a linesman can\u2019t tell, there\u2019s no reason it should be reviewed",

Are you looking for a different 100% conclusive photo?\n\nDo you think because you saw some different angles that don't 100% conclusively show the offside that means the photo that does 100% conclusively show the offside somehow doesn't count? \n\nDo you refuse to look at the photo that 100% conclusively shows the offside so you can tell yourself what you saw was inconclusive?",
            "Very silly comment. Regardless about how somebody feels on the knee it is inherently a subjective decision. This case is totally different because whether a play is offside or not is 100% objective (regardless of if there\u2019s evidence which in this case there was). \n\nYou\u2019re comparing apples and oranges as if they\u2019re both bananas",

            "They showed a much clearer still shot later in the broadcast.",
            "But where do you draw the line? Is it ok if he\u2019s 8 inches offsides as long as he wasn\u2019t cherry picking? 6 inches? 3 inches? \n\nAnd then once you allow that then when you call something that\u2019s 9 inches over the line people will bitch about it being the same play as the one you let go that was 8 inches over the line. And that would also add additional judgement responsibilities on the ref or linesman to determine if it was in \u201cthe spirit of the rule.\u201d That\u2019s why you just have to draw clear lines and stick to them. There\u2019s no judgement of spirit required. You were either over the line before the puck or you weren\u2019t. And it\u2019s consistent for everybody. You have to draw the line somewhere, it\u2019s the only way to do it.",
            "Only halfway though. The ref can still blow it off immediately, he's just told to let it go and have the video assistant check it.\n\nCase in point: the Bayern - Real champions league game from two months ago.",

            "Obviously pissed about this one but I\u2019ve hated this rule since it was implemented for exactly the reason you mentioned. It\u2019s not improving the game.",

            "That's easy to say.  They don't call every cross check or slash unless it's super blatant or interferes with the play.   To look at every pixel for an offside call seems pretty bogus.",
            "Yep, see Sabres loss in the Stanley Cup with the No Goal Incident where gray area finished the Sabres (similar goals had been disallowed earlier in the year in other games/called \"no goal\")\n\nBetter to be black and white.",
            "It shouldn't be challengeable to begin with.",
            "Wonder how many of Gretzky\u2019s goals would\u2019ve been called back? The whole point is that it shouldn\u2019t really be reviewed if there\u2019s no clear advantage and the ref, sitting on the line, can\u2019t even tell. I get the arguments for replay, but offsides is so damn annoying every time",
            "Not really but ok",
            "Like fucking what? \ud83e\udd23",
            "I would've been ok with that being a \"nor enough evidence to over turn the call on the ice.\"  We're talking about pixels at game speed.  It didn't matter on that play.",
            "It\u2019s not \ud83d\udcafconclusive. Show me the me still shot. Only still shot, and the puck was hidden. So how is this conclusive? Again if you are calling this \ud83d\udcaf conclusive, why was Nurse\u2019s blatant knee to knee overturned? You can\u2019t state that offsides is conclusive with limited angles and overturn Nurse\u2019s blatant knee because there wasn\u2019t intent.",
            "You are missing the point but keep making excuses. Ridiculous",
            "But not to win more than one game in the second round.",
            "nah, you definitely can. it was a close game, but the saints were going to win until that missed call. normally im with you about this kind of thing. this game is the exception.",
            "No I watched the whole series, and the Oilers looked like they did at the beginning of the season when they were setting records for suck.",
            "Empty netters at the end of games aren\u2019t dominance. Hope you get what you deserve and lose Monday",
            "Are you talking about the still they showed in the third with both the puck and the skate already in the zone? Or was there a second still that I missed?",
            "If your linesman is missing offsides by 8in, then you get a new linesman lmao",
            "Never heard of that, interesting",
            "Those are judgement calls though, and people get upset because they aren\u2019t consistently called the same way. Do you want to start making offside a judgement call by the refs based on whether they think it offered an advantage? It\u2019s basically the \u201cC\u2019mon it\u2019s Smokey, so his foot slipped over the line a little\u201d mentality. \n\nDo you think the goal line should not be rigorously enforced either? What if the puck is 9/10ths over the line? Should we just call that a goal because it\u2019s close enough or what? \n\nYou have to have one black and white standard that\u2019s consistently applied to line rules, otherwise if you make them a suggestion rather than a rule it opens up a Pandora\u2019s box and you don\u2019t want to go there. \n\nNow if you just want to get rid of replay altogether then that\u2019s another argument.",
            "When does it matter though?  He can be an inch over? Ok.   What about two?  Three?  Six?  A foot?\n\nOpening rules up to interpretation is silly.",
            "Only a little better than the canes that can't win a game in the third round",

            "The oil have two shorties.  How many PP goals do the cats have?",
            "I saw one where it was clear the skate was past, and the puck was still a hair on the line.\n\nIt was the right call, but holy crap a single video frame may have changed the whole game, or even the who holds the cup in the end.",
            "Either way the principle is the same no matter what numbers you want to plug in. The point is it\u2019s either black and white, or you open it up to the linesman going, \u201cehh close enough.\u201d",
            "A crosscheck is a crosscheck and a slash is a slash.  That offside could've easily been a judgment call at game speed.  I would've been ok with that being a \"not enough evidence to overturn the call on the ice\"  we're talking pixels at game speed.  It didn't affect the play at all.",
            "3-0",
            "It\u2019s not though? My comment specifically said to call offsides where it\u2019s offsides, but it shouldn\u2019t be reviewable, if the linesman didn\u2019t call it at the time then that\u2019s that. There\u2019s no \u201coh 3inches is ok, oh okay now 6, etc\u201d like it\u2019s literally just if you can\u2019t tell without reviewing the play and putting it into a still then we\u2019re all good",
            "There was definitive evidence that it was offside though. You just don\u2019t like the idea of the game being decided by something so minuscule that didn\u2019t effect the play. And I understand that sentiment, but that\u2019s not the rule. It\u2019s black and white, offside or on. Otherwise that would be giving the Panthers special treatment because, \u201cC\u2019mon dude that\u2019s such a small difference\u201d. Well they need to change the rules then if they want to be able to say, \u201cYes it was offside, BUT\u2026.\u201d\n\nI would be in favor of taking away replay for offside calls, and that would effectively give you what you\u2019re asking for, where the refs eye at real speed should be enough for the spirit of the rule, but once you introduce replay and the refs know for sure if it was off or on, you\u2019re committed to calling what the evidence shows.",
            "I'd be ok with taking away the replay.  You're not going to change my mind.  That was a weak call.  I'm not convinced it was offside.  If that was offside, then I want to see every cross check, slash, high stick, boarding, and penalty call be reviewed too.  Let's get it right."
