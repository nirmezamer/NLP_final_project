I was curious to see what the community thought of choice va select as far as price points, difference in taste/quality and if it was worth it to carry both or just one. Any input is greatly appreciated ",

            "I manage a large supermarket meat department. We buy choice or higher. Occasionally the fillets are select. I honestly don\u2019t even know what a select rib or strip looks like but I\u2019d say it depends on what your demographics are used to. If we suddenly started selling select everything, everyone would notice. I will say the difference between choice and prime is huge. Based on the lack of marbling in the select fillets I\u2019d assume the step down to select is not only noticeable, but a big decrease in quality, especially for the middle meats. Currently our choice ribs are between 12-14/lb cost and the strips are about 9-11/lb. The choice fillets are north of 15/lb. Closer to 17-19/lb. To be honest we don\u2019t get a huge break on price for select fillets so if you have choice available to you I\u2019d go for that",
            "Our small town meat department reps the Certified Angus Beef program. Our customers love the quality. We are very diligent about keeping our orders small as to not compromise the quality of the meat by keeping it as fresh as possible.\n\nWhatever you choose, keeping it fresh and making sure it's presented well will make your customers keep coming back. \n\nBest of luck!",
            "Some things it matters on.  Some things it doesn\u2019t.  Sometimes the price is so close (looking at you top sirloin) that there is little reason to get select.  I tend to look at it like this.  If they are buying the steak for the quality (ribeye, filet, strip, sirloin) then get them good quality.  If they are buying the cheapest option available (any round steak, most shoulder steaks) I try and keep it as cheap as possible which usually involves going with select.  Some cuts work better as select.  I make my cube steaks out of eye.  Choice works okay, but I find select works better most of the time.  Same for anything people want to make jerky out of.  I\u2019ve had people specifically request select grade after trying to use choice when they made jerky.",
            "Is not Angus just the breed of cattle and not a grade of beef? A \u201cCertified Angus\u201d could be graded Select.",

It must then meet the following 10 specifications:\n\n*Marbling and Maturity*\n\nModest or higher marbling \n\nMedium to fine marbling texture \n\nOnly cattle harvested less than 30 months of age by dentition and only A-maturity lean\n\n*Consistent Sizing*\n\n10 to 16 square inch ribeye area \n\n1100-pound hot carcass weight or less \n\n1\" or less fat thickness \n\n*Quality appearance and tenderness*\n\nSuperior muscling \n\nPractically free of capillary rupture \n\nNo dark cutters\n\nNo neck hump exceeding 2\"\n\n\nHope this helps!",
            "CAB is a marketing tool. It means that the cattle is at least 51% Angus. Nothing more. CAB comes in all grades.",
            "CAB is a marketing tool for consumers. CAB can only be given to beef with a Modest amount of marbling or more (and some other requirements) which would only let it be eligible for Choice or Prime. Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner would not be eligible. \n\nTo qualify for Angus on the hoof they must have a black body, with no white behind the shoulders, a white face is fine. White can not be above the flanks, so no belts or spots. They can have a white switch but must have a black tail head. Paperwork can also be provided proving genetics. \nThis is different from when the requirement was 51% black to qualify for Angus on the hoof.",
            "I agree and disagree. CAB is most certainly a marketing tool, however our meat room used to be strictly Choice, and since switching our beef to CAB, we as butchers have noticed a difference in the meat we are cutting. Our customers have noticed a difference in the meat we are selling. Our store has been known for years as serving the best quality meat in the valley, and customers that have been shopping there for 30+ years started coming back night after night telling us the steak they bought was the most tender steak they've ever had. \n\nSo while I agree that CAB has done a fantastic job with their marketing (not to mention the amazing support they give us retailers, including all sorts of free promotional materials), the quality really does speak for itself.",
            "I'm  not knocking CAB. It is mostly great product, but the simple fact is that 75 to 80% of all beef sold commercially is either red or black angus, or some combination of the 2. I just think that CAB has a better selection process for what they put the brand on."
