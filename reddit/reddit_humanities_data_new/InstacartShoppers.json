        "content": "I live in the middle of nowhere. \nI sometimes end up delivering to places where the population barely hits 2k. \n\nI deliver to older folk all the time. One time, an older woman tipped me in 3 strawberries. :) \ud83c\udf53 \n\nToday, I was in my car waiting for an order, and the only order that popped up? A grocery store 47 MINUTES AWAY, and her home a total of 42 miles from me. \n\nI sighed, but figured I had nothing else going on today, so I accepted the $20 order. \n\nI traveled, I shopped, loaded up and drove some more miles. When I arrived, I didn\u2019t even know if I was at the right place. I peaked at the locked up fence and overgrown yard. 4 unleashed dogs lost their marbles when I approached. (I learned quickly they were just protective. They were actually very sweet)  I just stood there, gazing around for about 10 minutes. I tried calling and texting the customer and all, no answer. \n\nI took one final peak passed the gate and there she is, an old woman sitting with her wooden stick of a cane on her concrete stairs. I had a hard time unraveling the chained up fence, but I managed, and carried her groceries up her overgrown driveway. \n\n\u201cSorry about that Joyce, I didn\u2019t see you there!\u201d \n\nShe kinda nodded her head and kept telling her dogs to shut up. This poor old woman. My soul freaking hurt for her man.\n\n I said \u201care you alright darlin\u2019?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m sick, but I just need to take my iron and once I\u2019m better I\u2019m getting the heck out of here.\u201d \n\nShe also apologized for not opening the gate for me. She said she has a hard time walking down there. I said it was no worries at all. \n\nInstead of leaving her semi-heavy groceries outside, I offered to put them inside for her, to which she said I could leave them on the floor near the fridge. \n\nI unbagged and put her items on her counter instead so she wouldn\u2019t need to crouch down for them. \n\nI came out and told her I was all done, and she thanked me. Then I asked, \u201cyou live out here all alone?\u201d Yup. She did. \n\nShe had no car, and no family to check on her. She said she usually orders from Walmart, but the last delivery she placed was TWO DAYS LATE, and her + her dogs went without food for that time. \n\nI asked if it was okay if I left my number for her, that way if she ever needed anything, she could just call me, and I\u2019ll make every effort to be there. And that\u2019s what I did. Wrote it in bold with my name. I wished her a good day, she blessed me, and I headed on out but man\u2026 it shook me up so bad. I hope she\u2019s alright. I hope she calls when needed. :(",

            "This almost made me cry. I understand because I feel the same way when I do those types of orders. And like you, I do always leave my number and feel so bad just doing that. There have been a time or 2 when someone very much older and/or crippled have offered me CASH tips, but I never EVER like to take it. I figure that could be my grandparents or parents or me someday and what would I want someone to do. \n\nAfter talking to my grandma about it, she told me that if they are super persistent, then I should take the tip and maybe leave it inside their mailbox or use it to bless someone else. She said when I refuse (her opinion, of course), I'm taking away the blessing from that individual. I guess I never looked or seen it that way, but I can see how that could be possible. It just doesn't make me feel good at all. \n\nI always offer to put the groceries away and leave out anything they may need for that evening, etc. It's really sad when you learn they are all alone and it sounds like she was way out there in the middle of nowhere. You did the right thing and you will forever be rewarded.",

I've made special trips to liquor stores to get the Hostess snacks that are always sold out at my local grocery stores.\n\nI've been given pristine $2 bills, change, cooked food, and the the most tear inducing comments. This job makes me frustrated sometimes, but moms planning birthdays, disabled people, elderly people, baby medicine orders, and anything related to sessy time always make me happy \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I could easily be that woman. I rely on you lovely shoppers for life, really. My shoppers will put my groceries away, put them inside for me, or whatever I need. I do try to tip adequately for the nice things you do. Please accept my grateful thanks for your kindness to us old ladies of the world.",
            "Elsewhere I was chastised on this board for delivering inside a house.  Yes in my example it was for the (I assume) cook for a rich white guy.  But ordinarily I do deliver inside the house to people who ask me to; frequently that included houses with special people (I have delivered to a bunch of group homes), mothers with infants and particularly old people.  I can say old.  I'm really old myself, but I see these folks who can barely move, they look like they can barely take care of themselves.  I fear that's going to be me in a few years.  They answer the door with their canes or a wheelchair or their walker.  I couldn't conceive of them carrying a 10 bag of potatoes on their walker.  One guy was stuck at 90\u00ba and could only eat yoghurt.  I've helped the same guy fill his refrigerator three times.  Putting things up on countertops is essential for a lot of these folks.  I can relate.  I'm always in fear the next time I bend over, I might not come back up.\n\nI will also say some of my biggest unicorn orders were to drug treatment facilities and most of them have provided \"resident\" labor who enthusiastically have carried the big boxes of stuff from the car into the residence for me.",

In other words, we all get back what we put in. \n\nWhen I put it into the way I do things, it made total sense. I'm a giver, not because I believe that in doing so, I will be blessed. But I do belive that when times are rough for me and I somehow make it thru just when I'm ready to throw in the towel it's because of the way I have blessed others that it's now coming back to me. \n\nMy grandma is a wonderful woman, and she's provided me with a lot of wisdom.

I suffer from chronic pain in my stomach, and at times, it is so bad that I also can not get out of bed. Most have no idea of my health struggles because they see me working a full time job Monday through Friday then coming straight home for maybe 30 min, long enough to change clothes then I'm back out the door working instacart and I do that 7 days a week. \n\nEvery day, I pray for strength because I'm a single mom to a soon to be 15 year old. It's been she and I since she was 2 years old, and I'm the ONLY one that has provided financial support since she was 2. I'm actually just getting back to being able to instacart because I was in so much freaking pain back in Sept I ended up being rushed to the ER only to find that I need emergency surgery. I was out of work for 6 months, just returned in March. \n\nThe first hospital I ended up at had no idea what was going on after several hours of testing. Luckily, they shared their test results and findings with area hospitals, and another doctor was familiar with what he saw, so I was transferred the following day for ER surgery. I don't have much to give, and every single day, it seems that if it's not the already existing pain I suffer, it's something financial or something else. \n\nFolk asks me all the time how come I never hesitate to do for someone else when no one ever does for me or I usually need it more so than the person I'm giving it to. That's just not the way I see it at all. I have been through so much health wise that there is no way I should even be able to work 1 job, let alone 2. I am blessed in so many ways that I literally have to constantly remind myself of those little things. \n\nI'm so trying to teach my daughter to see things the way I see it. And try to find a way EVERYDAY if not a few times a day to give back. I tell her a simple Hello to someone in the morning can brighten their day and can also be a blessing to them. You just never know. I love seeing people happy especially when I know that I played a role in it. \n\nYou sound like an amazing mom with wonderful children. Keep doing great. I will be praying for you and your health. Just take it one day at a time. I can tell your strong and a fighter, and you're not gonna let this situation consume you. I always tell myself even tho I know it's super painful and had impacted my life so much that there are so many things I have never done that I'm scared to do because or my health conditions. Especially when I see others out living their best life. Wishing it was me. But then I stop and think, it could be 10x worse. There are thousands of people I'm sure that would actually want to have my life over the one they have. \n\nHave a good sleep and a wonderful and blessed weekend.",
            "if i had had a mom growing up even half as wonderful as you, my world would be a much better place. i admire you so much and you are so inspiring. giving your child the childhood that so many kids desperately crave love from!! one thing i want to say, being a single mom is so incredibly hard. i understand i\u2019m not one so i cannot fully understand the struggle since i\u2019m not you but i can majorly empathize and i want you to know you\u2019re not alone. you know how your grandma was an amazing woman? so is mine. and she went to nursing school full time after being left by my abusive grandfather, she ended up getting her degree to be an RN extremely accelerated all while taking care of 2 young babies at the same time. she says the only way she was able to do it is because God gave her that strength to get through. trust me; things will truly get better. i know i\u2019m not God, but i know i have the holy spirit within me and always want to help others too and sometimes we don\u2019t even realize that we\u2019re doing God\u2019s work in the things we say or do. you are a blessing to so many people, including your young daughter. also i just want to stress that it\u2019s okay to not always go out if you have health conditions and things. lay down and rest when you can which i know is hard right now; your body is precious\ud83e\udd0d  and it\u2019s also important to give yourself grace as you navigate this situation as you have been through so much and God can see your heart. please keep talking to Him, He wants to hear from you \ud83e\udd0d"
