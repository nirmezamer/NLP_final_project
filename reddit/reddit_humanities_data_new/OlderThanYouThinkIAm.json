I recently requested it, and was granted permission yesterday.  \n\nThe rules are going to remain the same as they were before.  If you're new to the sub or just need a refresher you can find them here:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OlderThanYouThinkIAm/about/rules/\n\n\nI had to clean the sub up a little last night, the former head mod threw a bit of a tantrum when he deleted his account over the API changes, and the title and description had quite a few obscenities directed to the admins.  If I missed anything, let me know.  \n\nOutside of that if you have any questions, concerns, changes you would like to see, please feel free to comment them here.  \n\nI most likely will be looking for mods in the near future, but right now I just want to see how active this sub actually gets after being banned for the past six months.  \n\n\nSo again, welcome back everyone, and we all look forward to any new stories you would like to share.",

The last time I moderated a message board was back in I think 2004.  As much as I like to think that was \"just a few years ago\", it's obviously not lol.  \n\nBut I'll try to start monthly discussion threads after the holidays."

I think that people perpetually thinks that I'm a 15 year old. A supervisor at work thought I just finished high school. Y'know, fresh out of school. I don't even look remotely college age.",

I was separated for a while but still wasn\u2019t sure if  I was ready. Eventually, I finally agreed & had the best time! We went out a few more times & our ages finally came up (not sure why it took us 6 months then 3 dates in.)  But it did &  that\u2019s when I 34f found out he was a 24m! He looked and acted older (look/career wise) & well he thought I was his age & vice versa. Well I didn\u2019t like the idea of being a cougar (I thought) & he needed to go through life so I knew there was no chance of something serious. I even went NC for a while. However on and off to this day we still see each other from time to time. (My BFF says 8 years but you won\u2019t BE WITH HIM) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "When I was a 19-year-old man, I was briefly engaged to a 29-year-old woman. We both had obscured our age a little by telling selective truths. We were both going to college. I told her I was going to graduate soon (which was true, because I was in an accelerated program \u2014 I graduated with my BS in Physics when I was 19), and she told me where she was going to college (but she failed to tell me she was going *back* to college and was in graduate school).\n\nWe had a good laugh a few weeks after we started dating when we figured out how old the other one was. Frankly, I think her parents were more bothered by it than mine. Ultimately, though, we were incompatible, probably because I wasn't really finished growing up yet.",
