Only two will leave!\n\n#Do your faves have what it takes to make it all the way to the top?\n\n---\n\n#Adequate Argument Contest, Season 3 - Signups Open June 10 thru June 24\n\n---\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Hypepost](https://redd.it/1daeesp) \n * [Reddit](https://redd.it/1daeesp)\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/adequate-argument-contest-season-3-hypepost-a-tag-team-character-versus-debate-contest.1168035/)\n\n* [Tiersetter Page](https://redd.it/1bzkuxk) \n\n* Signups\n * [Reddit](https://redd.it/1dcltp2)\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/adequate-argument-contest-season-3-signups-a-tag-team-character-versus-debate-contest.1168560/)\n\n---\n\n#What\u2019s Going On?\n\nThis is a debate focused bracketed tournament where users pick characters to argue against other users to determine who would win, with a \u201cTiersetter\u201d character functioning as a measuring stick for the acceptable \u201cpower level\u201d of the tournament. You pick two characters, present your case why they win against your opponent's team, and a panel of judges determine who made the most persuasive argument to crown the victor. [See the hypepost here for more information.](https://redd.it/1daeesp)\n\n---\n#Signups:\n\nTo 'sign up', one need merely comment below with a team of fictional (or real, hell who knows!) characters that fit the guidelines stipulated hereafter.\n\nAll characters submitted must have a linked \"Respect Thread\" including all the scans/feats you intend to use in the debate. The [Respectthreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/wiki/index) forum has a large pre-existing list of these, but you may draw from any comprehensive equivalent or create one yourself. Vs Battles Wiki pages are not permissible substitutes.\n\nIf you intend to use scaling to other characters, you ought to also link the threads for them.\n\n**Characters submitted who are found to have misleading RTs that leave out too much without disclosing may be disqualified.**\n\nSimilarly, introducing too many new transformative feats not present in your linked signup will also be penalised. It's okay if you go and grab new supplemental stuff for ability interactions, etc. mid-tourney, but you shouldn't be presenting brand new feats that radically alter perception of your character's strength.\n\nNote: the death of the hosting website Gfycat has taken some popular RTs offline. I have personally backed up many of them and am in the process of reuploading them to alternate hosts. If there's a broken thread you'd like to use, just ask. Failing that, try the links in wayback machine.\n\n##Formatting:\n\n***AN IMPORTANT NOTE***\n\nTo sign-up, I will be requiring people submit their characters in the following format:\n\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match-Up | Stipulations\n---|---|---|---|---\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match Up | Stips\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match Up | Stips\n\nFor non-RES users (cringe!) out there, this is the formatting:\n\n>Character | Tier | Series | Match-Up | Stipulations  \n\\---|---|---|---|---  \n|||||  \n|||||  \n\nSimply copy-paste the formatting above and submit your entrants in this format so I can save myself several hours of formatting everybody's stuff uniformly.\n\n##Tier:\n\nThe **Tier** category delineates whether the character is being submitted to [Cable or Deadpool tier.](https://redd.it/1bzkuxk) **You must submit one and only one character to each tier.**\n\n* Cable is a brawler armed with a rapid fire, long ranged heavy weapon that tears apart his enemies' bodies. He supplements his ability to provide fire support, [telekinetic ballistic shields](https://imgur.com/35wELW3) as cover, and intuitive telepathic tracking of his opponents.\n\n* Deadpool is an agile assassin who fights with unpredictable acrobatics wielding a blade that can [cleave through moderate amounts of metal.](https://imgur.com/oHIbjJl) He has a potent healing factor which allows him to fight recklessly through injuries, and [a long ranged teleporter that lets him scout the battlefield and freely reposition with his ally.](https://imgur.com/a/xG1wLab)\n\nThis tier is designed for characters who can [react to bullet](https://imgur.com/a/M94bZZ0) to [arrow-speed projectiles](https://imgur.com/a/mG363OE), bust [sizable holes through concrete with exertion](https://imgur.com/a/dJFMGFW), and endure similar impacts.\n\nMore than that, this tier is designed for teams that synergize well together in creative, effective, and unpredictable ways.\n\nThe two tiers are deliberately asymmetrical, with Deadpool as the more dangerous and mobile melee combatant while Cable is slower and less durable, but offers ranged support and telepathic tracking to enhance Deadpool's effectiveness. This dynamic should be reflective in team composition, with mixed support and offence taken into account.\n\n##Matchups:\n\nThe **Match-Up** category is where you delineate whether the character scores a Likely Victory, Unlikely Victory, or Draw in a fight against the chosen tiersetter.\n\n *  **Unlikely victory** means your character is definitely outgunned but can absolutely set up a victory through superior skill, tactics, or a hidden manoeuvre that is draining. Bullseye versus Daredevil is an unlikely victory for Bullseye, and Kanoh Agito vs Kuroki Gensai would be an unlikely victory for Kanoh that relies on the Dragonshot landing.\n\n *  **Draw** is self explanatory, 50/50. Captain America versus Batman with no gadgets, or Luffy versus Rob Lucci are good examples.\n\n *  **Likely victory** means your character is superior in most if not all aspects and can readily use those to win after a slightly extended fight. Superman versus Hal Jordan in-character is a likely victory for Supes, as would be Kenpachi Zaraki versus Ichigo Kurosaki in their first meeting after Ichigo learns to cut Kenpachi.\n\n**In addition to declaring your characters\u2019 matchup vs the tiersetter, you will also need to briefly justify it in a few sentences.**\n\nFor example, a justification of a Draw for Captain America in Batman Tier could be \u201cBatman is slightly weaker in physical categories, but a more agile and technical fighter. Captain America is slightly stronger, more durable, and has a powerful defensive tool with the shield, but Batman can get around it using his speed and skill.\u201d\n\n**For this tournament you must not only provide a justification of your individual characters vs tiersetters in a 1v1, but a justification of your team against both tiersetters in a 2v2 match.**\n\nEx: \"My team of Captain America and Batman are a 50/50 **Draw** vs Cable and Deadpool, as both are comparable in strength, durability, and speed to the tiersetters. Cap's shield counters the tiersetters' guns, but is countered by Deadpool's teleportation. Batman's stealth lets him outmanoeuvre both the enemy team, but is countered by Cable's telepathy.\"\n\nFor the purposes of a default tiersetter match, assume the arena is [Waterton Lakes.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrq41/) Tiersetters start at Spawn A.\n\n**HOWEVER, note that OOT judgements will be determined on a case by case basis for the arena of the current match taking place.**\n\nDon\u2019t think you can get away with arguing your Avatar Earthbender insta wins by causing a mass cave in on Metro just because the default match is an open air forest.\n\n##Stipulations:\n\nThe **Stipulations** category is for minor alterations to your character. This could include changes to their gear, powers, mindset, scaling, or sources used. The following are examples of reasonable stips:\n\n* The T-800, wielding a minigun.\n\n* Mace Windu, cannot use force-crush on opponents.\n\n* X-23, brainwashed and bloodlusted by Trigger 42.\n\n* Post-Crisis Batman, only feats from Year One.\n\nCertain conditional stipulations are also permissible to allow a character's environmentally limited abilities to function:\n\n* Firelord Ozai, Sozin's Comet is in the sky\n\nStipulations **CAN NOT** alter a characters\u2019 stats directly (IE \u201cNerf strength to tier\u201d) or change them or their loadout in ways that is not reflective of them in their source media (no giving Batman a lightsaber, no arbitrary 'Morals Off' stips without canonical basis).\n\nComposites are an allowable stip on a case by case basis. As a general rule of thumb, the most kosher composites will be versions of a character with the fewest debate-relevant contradictions to account for. IE: Compositing Anime & Manga versions of Goku is perfectly fine because they are essentially the same character, but compositing Paper Mario & Platformer Mario is not---the question of what a hybrid paper/meat body would be like is too messy.\n\n##DUPLICATE BAN:\n\nNo duplicates of the same character may be run. The exact definition of a duplicate may have to be determined on a case by case basis, but suffice to say any small alterations or simply different arcs for characters is not acceptable. You can run \"Savage Hulk\" and \"Grey Hulk\", or \"Post Crisis Superman\" and \"Pre-Crisis Superman,\" but not Saiyan Saga Goku and Namek Goku, or MCU Thanos from Endgame and MCU Thanos from Infinity War.\n\nThe person who made the feat thread for the character gets first dibs on claiming them **for the first 5 days** of signups.\n\n##OC BAN:\n\n***NO OC CHARACTERS CAN BE RAN BY THE PERSON WHO CREATED THEM! YOU MUST RUN CHARACTERS WHOSE CANON PORTRAYAL YOU YOURSELF CANNOT INFLUENCE DIRECTLY.***\n\n##SPECIAL RULE: Primary Combatants\n\nCombatants with summons, multiple bodies, mounts, riders, pets, etc. must have **one individual identified as the Primary Combatant in their signup post.** If the Primary Combatant is defeated, all entities submitted under the same slot vanish.\n\n##SPECIAL RULE: No Backups\n\n**THERE ARE** ***NO*** **BACKUP CHARACTERS FOR THIS TOURNEY. IF YOU GET OOT\u2019D, TOO BAD.**\n\n##Example Characters:\n\n[Here are some example picks for the tier, including links to repositories of their feats.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReDKxmZoA9AkDEocT0B9aAipjpYCJXo2ntBz2N-rnBo/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n#Rules:\n\n##Battle Rules:\n\n* Speed is not to be equalised in any respect for this tournament. A character's provable speed feats are what they will be entered and argued as.\n\n* Combatants spawn in aware that there are two opponents somewhere in the arena that they and their ally must defeat in order to progress.\n\n* All combatants are aware of the basics of their allies' combat abilities and may choose to communicate them in greater detail during the match, but are in the blind to that of their opponents (unless they have canon knowledge of them).\n\n* Combatants with minions, multiple bodies, mounts, riders, pets, etc. must have **one individual identified as the Primary Combatant in their signup post.** If the Primary Combatant is defeated, all entities submitted under the same slot vanish.\n\n* Victory is by either permanent death or incapacitation. Incapacitation is defined by an inability to continue fighting, whether unconscious, bound, immobilised, or too injured/exhausted to fight back. This condition must last for more than 12 full seconds without conscious maintenance from an opponent (so maintaining a wrestling hold for 12 seconds would not count as incap if the opponent could keep fighting if let go.) Voluntarily going to sleep doesn't count as an incap assuming a match is argued to last long enough for sleep to be necessary. Incapacitated opponents vanish from the arena. Corpses do not. **Combatants are aware of rules around victory conditions.**\n\n##General Map Rules:\n\n**Map Selection:**\n\nDefault round maps will be on a random elimination rotation, meaning Round 1\u2019s map will be randomly selected between all seven, Round 2 will be rolled from the remaining six, and so on.\n\n**Map Vetoes:**\n\nAlternatively, instead of debating on the default map for the round, if both opponents agree, they may instead veto one map each and roll from the remaining options.\n\nVetoes may ONLY occur if both opponents agree to them.\n\n**Gentlemanning:**\n\nBoth opponents may unanimously agree to pick a specific map to debate on.\n\n#Veto or Gentleman map switches must be agreed upon and announced to judges prior to the debate's first posted response.\n\n**Map Features:**\n\n* Each team is given two physical maps of the current battlefield. The maps indicate a team\u2019s own spawn location and include a compass along with instructions on how to use it. All text appears to the reader to be written in whatever their first language is a la Doctor Who \"Psychic Paper.\" Characters who cannot read, perceive, or understand the map (illiterate, blind, nonsentient, etc.) are instead implanted with a rough directional memory of where major landmarks are in relation to each other.\n\n* All maps are devoid of human beings but still populated by their usual wildlife unless otherwise specified.\n\n* As a general rule of thumb, maps include all objects you might reasonably expect to find in a given location. IE; in a [Vice City gun store](https://i.imgur.com/SrdwYMF.png) there are firearms and boxes of ammunition.\n\n* The exception to this are operational ground vehicles (cars, bikes, motorcycles, trains), all of which are absent. Non-functional vehicles such as [broken down trains](https://imgur.com/a/fwzqLkc) or [wrecked cars](https://i.imgur.com/R5ymzwt.png) are still present.\n\n* All sunlight present on the map will not inhibit vampires or other characters with an inherent weakness to the sun. It is as warm and bright as normal sunlight.\n\n* Whowouldwinium is a immovable, indestructible material that otherwise functions as the equivalent of whatever material it is replacing (EX concrete & steel lining in Metro tunnels). Abilities like ATLA Earthbending cannot reshape whowouldwinnium, but can generate [projectiles or protrusions from them as normal.](https://i.imgur.com/nOohUo7.mp4) Intangible/teleporting characters may pass through whowouldwinnium barriers **by themselves** (without passengers, willing or unwilling), but will be automatically disqualified by BFR if they do not return to the normally accessible part of the arena within 12 seconds.\n\n* All combatants are aware of the above conditions, as well as all map-specific information outlined below **EXCEPT FOR** the spawn locations of their opponents.\n\n##Map Specific Rules:\n\n* [Vice City, Florida](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nritq/)\n\n* [Waterton Lakes National Park](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrq41/) \n\n* [Moscow Metro, Circa 2033](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrqun/)\n\n* [Mal\u00e9, Maldives](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6k1oqk/)\n\n* [Pearl Skyscraper, Hong Kong](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6npdfy/)\n\n* [Isla Nublar, Costa Rica](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6npdyk/)\n\n* [Mystery Flesh Pit National Park](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6eaw24/)\n\n##Debate Rules:\n\n* Rounds will last roughly 5 and a half days, hopefully from Monday until Saturday at noon of each week of the tourney; there is a 48 hour time limit both on starting (we do not care who starts, you and your opponent can figure that out) AND on responses, ***AND ADDITIONALLY*** each user MUST get in two responses or else be disqualified. If one user waits until the very last minute to force this rule to DQ their opponent without any forewarning to their opponents or the tournament supervisors, they will be removed from this tournament, no exceptions. If you need an extension, notify judges ahead of time.\n\n* Format for each round: the one to go first gets an Intro + 1st Response, their opponent replies in kind, then both get a 2nd response, then a 3rd response in a back-and-forth style, and a closing statement individual of one another that can be posted any time after both 3rd responses are complete. Each reponse has a 20k character limit, or two maximum length Reddit comments.\n\n * Intro posts cannot make any arguments comparing the poster\u2019s team with the opponents\u2019 characters. They are for outlining your characters\u2019 feats, fighting styles, and tactics.\n\n * Closing statements cannot make any new arguments or bring up any feats or details not already mentioned in the debate. They are for summarising your points in the debate.\n\n* A character can be disqualified mid tourney if the opposing debater calls for an Out Of Tier (OOT) request.\n\n * OOT requests works by pinging the head judge (me) and explaining why the character has been **argued** as Out Of Tier by the opponent---meaning their odds against the tiersetter with presented interpretations of their feats are greater than a Likely Victory and it unreasonable to expect the TS to be able to score a win.\n\n * Each participant gets 2 OOT requests for the whole tournament. An OOT request is lost if they make a request and it fails to go through.\n\n* OOTs may be made against an individual character (EX: declaring that the Incredible Hulk is Out Of Tier in a 1v1 tiersetter fight against Cable) or against an entire team (EX: declaring that the combination of two characters\u2019 abilities is too broken for the TS duo to combat, even if they are individually beatable.)\n\n* **All rounds for this tournament will be 2v2 team fights.**\n\nVictory in a debate will be determined by a majority vote of at least 2 out of 3 judges, though more may be brought in to decide a particularly contentious match.\n\nYour Judges Are:\n\n* /u/nkonrad\n\n* /u/joseph_stalin_\n\n* /u/British_Tea_Company\n\n* dargoo_faust\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/dargoo-faust.406822/)\n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/dargoo_faust)\n\n* Qawsedf234\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/qawsedf234.410176/) \n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/qawsedf234) \n\n* AbeLincoln1865\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/abelincoln1865.514007/)\n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Analypiss)\n\n* [Guderian2nd](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/guderian2nd.116487/) \n\n* And myself\n\n---\n\n#SIGNUPS END MONDAY JUNE 24.

He also has no means of fighting at range, with Cable's telepathy aiding in preemptively shooting Wolverine before he can close the distance. The blunt force aspect of Cable's bullets will be sufficient in staggering and hurting Logan. Cable wins if the fight is kept at range, and Wolverine wins if he can close the distance.\n* X-23: Laura has well-rounded physicals alongside regeneration to contend with Deadpool. While her claws could shred Wade, she is at a disadvantage in range. That combined with Deadpool's teleportation means that she'll struggle to land a meaningful hit on him, while Wade can win with decapitation.\n* 2v2: Right away, Logan and Laura are disadvantaged by the range superiority presented by Cable and Deadpool. Their senses can allow them to easily detect the tiersetters from a mile away, however, especially Deadpool, and their speed and mobility can help them close the distance. They're in trouble if Cable and Deadpool are able to keep their distance and continuously open fire on them, but if they can manage to close the distance, they'd likely win. Their chances at victory hinge entirely on whether they can get close enough, and Deadpool and Cable will make that a challenge for them.",
            "#[Team Still A Better Love Story Than Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rFBAGhvrM)\n\nCharacter | Tier | Series | Match-Up | Stipulations\n---|---|---|---|---\n| [Origin](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClericsConfidential/comments/1c06ygy/origin/)| Deadpool | [Origin](https://i.imgur.com/xBI23qS.jpeg)| Likely| [Origin 1.1](https://i.imgur.com/HZZrjig.png) with 1,250,000x intellect, fully repaired, before gaining emotions, with heat control, [his chapter 31 Atl-Atl+Katana, nano shoes, and backpack/laptop](https://i.imgur.com/i0HzfRh.png) [2](https://i.imgur.com/BThZaIS.png) the Exosuit, and Mini-Origin. Cannot turn anyone invisible. Winning the tournament fulfills \"Living Properly.\" [Has 3 200kg tungsten rods](https://i.imgur.com/BujhlSS.png).  Has 3 full refuels of glycogen and 2 emergency helium cooling packs. \n|[Edythe \"Femward\" Cullen](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClericsConfidential/comments/1cata5e/femward/)| Cable | [Twilight \\(Reimagined\\)](https://imgur.com/a/fVSaIQe) | Likely | No speed scaling to Edward Cullen or Bella Swan. Has her cellphone and a baseball. \n\n***\n\n* Origin is stronger, probably faster, and possibly more durable than Deadpool, however he lacks teleportation and must physically traverse distance to find him. [Origin's range](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=132) is countered by this. Deadpool's sword [impacts damage meaningful to him.](https://youtu.be/BmtDZPyaVpc?t=824) While Deadpool is a worse melee fighter he also possesses [an extremely high functional endurance](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=163). Impalement and range are unlikely to meaningfully impact Deadpool. While Origin can in theory quickly [win a melee fight](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=104) he has to rely on pure physicals and reactions to counteract the teleportation. [Origin can detect Deadpool from a far distance](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=67) but isn't able to stop him from teleporting without grappling him.\n\n* \"Origin 1.1\" means that Origin can use essentially all feats in the RT that aren't in the EoS Origin section and a few that are\n  * 1.25 million intelligence means he has the computational power of after chapter 68, but before Hirose Mai dies and he gains self awareness. \n  * Heat control means he has the ability to regulate his heat from this advanced intelligence.\n  *  His sword is his standard one as of chapter 31, his shoes allow him to root himself in place, and his bag has the device that functions as the exosuit.\n * The exosuit is the device used in feats marked with an X. Mini-Origin is a phone-bot that controls the device.\n\n***\n\n* [Femward](https://imgur.com/a/zvNhY27) ([Edythe](https://youtu.be/143GFLwm9Hk?t=254)) is [stronger](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=138), faster, and possibly more durable than Cable, however short of throwing something she is a strictly melee fighter, Cable's gun impacts blunt damage meaningful to hurt her even if it doesn't pierce her and have an advantage [by the time she reaches grappling range](https://youtu.be/BmtDZPyaVpc?t=1036). Edythe is at a disadvantage because not only can Cable equalize the advantage of mind-reading, [he can block hers out, essentially depriving her of a major sense](https://youtu.be/N-7gbWKbXbQ?t=67). If cable detects her from 100 meters or greater, [he gets over 15 chances to shoot at her](https://youtu.be/BmtDZPyaVpc?t=414). While cable is a worse melee fighter he also possesses non-trivial endurance, his cybernetic arm means that he can interact with Edythe's fangs without either instantly being bitten through or poisoned. While Edythe can quickly win a melee fight, she's fighting two distinct disadvantages. While Edythe has better grappling, Cable is able to meaningfully fight back with maximum exertion. Edythe having anything (a vehicle, branch, boulder, etc) to throw at him doesn't change this much because of the psychic shield. Overall Edythe is being doubly deprived of her main advantages as compared to how she would interact with someone  with physicals like an unarmed Cable or a Cable without telepathy.\n\n    * No speed scaling means speed statements from Edward's perspective won't be applied. [Edythe has a cellphone that she uses throughout the book](https://i.imgur.com/p1u78e5.png) \n\n\n***\n\nEdythe and Origin together move and react faster than the tier, but still lack instant travel and Cable's rate of fire. \n\n***\n* [Twilight Scaling](https://old.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/koh8xe/respect_edward_cullen_twilight/)\n *  [Bella](https://old.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/qb218e/respect_bella_swan_twilight/)\n* [Origin Scaling](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClericsConfidential/comments/1aeaook/actual_rts_supplements/) \n * [Gon](https://old.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/f9n7g0/respect_gon_origin/)\n * [Chronological RT](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/gen-discussion-1/origin-respect-thread-2103798/)",
            "[Tsukasa Hojo and Hiromu Arakawa Present\u2026](https://imgur.com/a/Btpn7uw)\n\n# [Hard and Harder](https://imgur.com/a/7YwKsVE)\n\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match-up | Stipulations\n---|---|---|---|---\nRyo Saeba | City Hunter | Cable | Likely Victory | Soft-composite of the City Hunter manga, anime, and the recent extremely faithful live action Netflix movie. Believes that the enemy team has kidnapped Kaori and will kill her soon if he doesn\u2019t defeat them. Ryo will start rounds wielding his signature .357 Magnum and a sniper rifle next to his Mini Cooper, which will contain various other weapons from his armory that he always has access to including rocket launchers, grenades, and whatever else is in the Gear section of his respect threads.\nGreed | Fullmetal Alchemist | Deadpool | Likely Victory | Manga, 2003 anime, and Brotherhood. Taken from the end of the series when he has merged with Ling Yao and is helping the Elric brothers stop Father. Greed will start the fight in control of Ling\u2019s body but can pass control back to Ling whenever he desires.\n\n**Matchups**\n\nRyo is similar in strength and durability to Cable and a good deal faster physically. Add on top of that Ryo\u2019s skill as a fighter compared to opponents with similar stats to him and Cable struggles a good deal at close range. Luckily both fighters favor mid-long ranged combat, where Cable fares a bit better. His barriers would stop Ryo\u2019s shots and Ryo would get obliterated by a single shot of Cable\u2019s guns. However, Ryo can still shoot just as accurately as normal while moving around and Cable struggles to hit moving targets, so it wouldn\u2019t take long for Ryo to hit Cable by ricocheting a bullet past his shield or even through the hole Cable forms to fire his own weapons (which he would know is happening due to being able to sense killing intent or by seeing the muscles in Cable\u2019s arm tense up).\n\nGreed is similar in speed to Deadpool thanks to scaling to King Bradley. His Ultimate Shield can protect him from any of Deadpool\u2019s guns and swords, and his regeneration is on the same level as Deadpool\u2019s own. His main weakness is that he tends to leave his head exposed which Deadpool can take advantage of using his teleportation belt and he cannot protect body parts that he is actively regenerating, leaving him open to repeated attacks from a particularly efficient/ruthless opponent. If Greed is getting out skilled by Deadpool, he can swap control to Ling who should be more than capable of matching DP.\n\nAs a duo, the pair should still fair decently well against Cable and Deadpool. Ling's ability to sense opponent's ki will limit the enemy team's ability to sneak up on them even with Deadpool's teleportation (Ryo sensing killing intent will serve a similar function and even allow Greed to avoid getting cheesed with a headshot). Greed can body block any shots from Cable's gun to protect Ryo (which he is more than fast enough to do) and Ryo offers a range option that Greed nor either fighter on the enemy team possess.

Has dual pistols w/ enough ammo, bo staff and knives.\nThe Master Chief|Cable|[Halo]() | Draw| Is in MJOLNIR Mk VI MOD ( Promethean Vision plugin), and has Cortana (pre-Rampancy), frag grenades, Needilizer, Type-51 Carbine and a Binary Rifle. Has enough ammo/grenades as needed. Ignore game feats. \n\n\n##**Stip Explanation**\n\n* Midnighter - He's given basically regular gear, with the addition of two dual pistols he used during Superman's liberation of Warworld. Compositing the two similar, but different canons of Wildstorm and n52/Rebirth\n\n* Master Chief - Gives him the upgraded Mark VI MJOLNIR armor that he had during the early stages of Halo 4. Equips him with a frag grenades, needilizer,  Covenant Carbine , and a Forerunner Binary Rifle.\n\n\n\n##**Match Ups**\n\n* **Midnighter:** Midnighter's key weapon, his precog, is useless against forces of chaos like Deadpool, having failed against Joker in the past. Directly contrasting physicals Midnighter is magnitudes more durable (blunt),  faster and stronger, he however has piercing durability far below Deadpool's output, and Deadpool's teleportation is much more conducive to in-combat use than Midnighter's. \n\n\n* **Master Chief:** Cable has the edge at range, while Chief's firearms are unable to piercing Cable's TK barrier, Cable's bullets will deal relevant (blunt force) damage to Chief. In close range however, Chief holds a slight advantage. He is possibly faster than Cable, with comparable durability and striking strength. He however outpaces Cable in lifting strength, and has a notable endurance edge. Cortana outside of tactical support doesn't influence the match too much. \n\n* **Team:** Together Chief and Midnighter make an effective kill team, with high mobility and combat power. Many of their normal advantages however are undermined by the opposing TSer team. Midnighter's battle computer will be less than reliable due to Deadpool introducing a large X-factor. Similarly his door's tactical advantage is diminished since Deadpool can teleport and Cable can telepathically communicate/locate allies and foes. Chief's Binary Rifle does pose a significant threat to Deadpool, but Cable provides a competent counter to it. Cortana doesn't really provide any huge edge for my team.\n\n\n***\n##**Scaling**\n\n*  Midnighter:\n\n * [Nightwing](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6y3uci/respect_nightwing_dc_comics_new_52rebirth/)\n\n * [Zealot](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/bcik1c/respect_zealot_wildstorm/)\n\n * [Swift](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/b4ldit/respect_swift_wildstorm/)\n\n * [MMH](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/lfp2co/respect_the_martian_manhunter_new_52rebirth/)\n\n* Master Chief\n\n * [Black Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/gb3mlr/respect_spartan_black_team_halo/)\n\n * [Red Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/gaijqj/respect_spartan_red_team_halo/)\n\n * [Gray Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/gkkb1p/respect_spartan_gray_team_halo/)\n\n\n * [Spartan IVs](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/j130cx/respect_the_spartan_ivs_halo/)\n\n * [Chief Supplement](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/fbv3cr/respect_john117_the_master_chief_halo/)",

Can use Boogie Woogie on his opponents and allies without Cursed Energy.\n\n##Justifications\n\n**Kamihate**\n\nKamihate can fight from extremely long ranges, and even in melee range is fairly quick, but is going to primarily rely on keeping his distance while trying to rapidly incapacitate Deadpool quicker than he can lock him down and teleport on top of him. Basically Kamihate can win by sufficiently damaging Deadpool enough that he can't escape from further shots and gets worn down by the bullets, but loses if Deadpool can track him down fast enough and get directly onto him with the teleporter.\n\n\n**Todo**\n\nHe slaps the thing and it vibrates and they switch like woooahhh. Todo doesn't have any capacity for dealing damage at a distance and by himself is far less capable of abusing the nature of his ability beyond being tricky to hit. In terms of raw stats Todo is probably somewhat higher than Cable, but lacks concrete speed and with his intentions being read via mind control will struggle to actively abuse the main aspect of his kit. Slightly stronger, but not nearly as enabled in a 1v1.\n\n**2v2**\n\nIn a 2v2, Cable's ability to passively scan his surroundings as well as inform Deadpool of Todo's intentions makes the strategy of those two considerably less effective. Finding Kamihate becomes much easier for Deadpool as well, and reaching them becomes trivial if Cable just informs Deadpool, their 2v2 strategy is extremely effective against exactly the teamwork that my team wants to pull off.",

She isn\u2019t unbeatable, and loses more often than not, but her superior stats and stealth/combat skills make the match winnable\n\nSkitter\u2019s talents hold up in a long-ranged battle. Swarm consciousness allows her to keep hidden from cable and protect herself while affording superior mobility, and her knife presents a wincon- cable might survive extended bug combat, but a good hit from the knife wins. Cable\u2019s ability to track her and superior AP means that victory isn\u2019t anywhere near certain, but she has a good chance\n\n2v2:\n\nIn this matchup, both of them have a significant advantage over the enemy team- stealth. Despite Cable's telepathy, his recon abilities (especially over a wide area) are massively inferior to Skitter's, and her swarm-mind might interfere with his telepathy to some extent. Mizu has normal, if very skillful, stealth abilities. The match begins and ends with Cable and Deadpool being utterly swarmed with insects, distracting and weakening them while Mizu arrives for the kill",

Khonshu in Moon Knights head|\n\n# Stip explanation\n\n* Dreamer - Comic and show dreamer have extremely similar powers but show Dreamer has more experience and can do more with energy manipulation but comic dreamer is a bit stronger, they basically the same though.\n* Moon Knight - I decided to use 2014 Moon Knight because he has good gear in this era and a good enough relationship with Khonshu to ask him for stuff.  I'll still be using feats from before the 2014 run just nothing after. Khonshu is in his head because he was in the 2014 run, he can't do much for Moon Knight, heal him some, minor stat boost, etc. Moon Knight is the primary fighter tho, if he dies Khonshu gone.\n\n# Match ups\n\n* Dreamer: Dreamer is incredibly agile with her teleportation and her precognition, combined with her forcefields and energy manipulation she should be able to dodge Cables shots and eventually take him down. However Cable is much more physically capable, smarter, and has more gear than Dreamer, who also doesn't have much experience dodging bullets surprisingly, so he definitely could win.\n* Moon Knight: He already beat Deadpool in Vengeance of the Moon Knight (2009) #8 so he'd win more times than not.

Her rage debuff [dazes her in non-combat situations](https://imgur.com/dRZdOJN) and her [strength](https://imgur.com/a/50jCxF5) and durability become significantly diminished. Deadpool will easily be able to play a keepaway game and make her progressively weaker through quips and attacks until she goes down. She is still a threat if she gets a solid hit in soon enough, but she is fighting directly into her weakness here.\n\n**Mirror Master:** Cable can read his mind to beat any ambushes or mirror tricks, and thanks to his shielding is not threatened by the glass gun at all. Mirror Master's only real path to victory is physically throwing Cable into a mirror, which puts him at huge risk of sustaining massive damage.\n\n**2v2:** They fare better as a team, but not massively. If Lyra is deposited into a 2v1 melee fight she still gets annoyed to death by Deadpool, and Cable can pretty easily protect Deadpool from Mirror Master's attack vectors that would actually do anything, plus Deadpool means more guns to ultimately put them down. There are perhaps some mirror tricks that could get Cable and Deadpool separated, but I doubt anything outside of \"kill Deadpool immediately, Lyra hunts and kills Cable\" would get the job done",

However, Quanxi's feats just generally show her doing a bit more with her time, not to mention taking things more seriously.

At this range, both combatants can be immediately lethal to the other. Zazie's likely victory comes from her greater skill and intelligence letting her set up a win.\n\n**VQ-Cable**\n\nCable benefits from being able to locate the queen with his telepathy. His high rate of fire and long range allow him to resist being swarmed, and telepathy makes ambushes and other maneuvers more difficult. Once he closes with the queen, they fight relatively evenly with ranged abilities, or in close quarters.\n\n**Team Justification:**\n\n\nThe combination of Cable's telepathy and Deadpool's teleportation allow them to locate the enemy team and directly engage before Zazie and the vord can set up the battlefield to their advantage. Deadpool's teleportation and Cable's shields allow them to negate and avoid the worst of Jitterbug's AOE attacks, by staying in close with one teammate or the other or blocking them. Jitterbug wins if Zazie or the queen can outplay the tiersetters and successfully land lethal shots while they are being engaged and harrassesd by the vord forces.",

Stip out [this](https://imgur.com/a/KAJuyaM) feat.\n\n#Justifications\n\n**Samus - Cable**\n\nThe key aspect to this matchup is that Samus's various ranged attacks are threatening to Cable, and Cable's gun is threatening to Samus, making this mostly come down to who gets shot first. Samus is faster, which is why this is a likely victory, but Cable's telepathy and pseudo danger sense give him a fair shot of securing initiative here.\n\n**Caerula - Deadpool**\n\nCaerula's strongest weapon, her precog, is not very useful against an opponent whose mind she can't effectively read, making this come down to physicals. Both characters are fast + piercing + extremely tolerant to injury archetypes, with Deadpool having superior mobility through teleportation and a better regeneration factor, but Caerula having a big edge in strength and enhanced senses, making this an even matchup.\n\n**2v2**\n\nMost of the reasons given for the individual matchups still apply here. Samus has weapons that are threatening to Deadpool, but the reverse is also true, and teleportation makes up for the range advantage she has. Caerula has better physicals than Cable, but she can't read his mind and is disadvantaged at range. I believe both these characters would still be in tier if they were to swap opponents, so it stands to reason they are in tier in the 2v2.\n\n#Stip Explanations\n\nSamus's stip makes it so she's at her strongest with all feats available, sans the one that's been stipped out.\n\nEverything else is self explanatory.\n\n#Scaling\n\nCaerula\n\n- [Battle Angel Alita](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/wiki/anime#wiki_battle_angel_alita_.28ganmu.29)\n- [Victor Byron](https://www.reddit.com/r/Criminal3x/comments/1aw2r43/victor/)\n- [Qu-Tsang](https://www.reddit.com/user/feminist-horsebane/comments/o5c6i1/qutsang_respect_thread/)\n- [Adding this since it's not in the rt too](https://imgur.com/a/vBscpSH)",

As seen in memory #8 he took down 15 bokoblins and 3 White-maned Lynels (the second toughest version of the most powerful enemy) only getting a single cut on his arm. He can also slow down time by jumping back at the right time allowing or easy hits. He can also use Urbosa's Fury for ranged attacks and Daruk's Protection to block anything Deadpool can throw at him.\n* Infinite: Infinite can release unavoidable pulses that show illusions. These can be anything including the sun crashing down on Earth, these illusions are so powerful they can actually hurt/kill the targets. He could create giant cannons to injure Cable severely and clones to draw fire. (He can summon clones but he is the primary combatant).\n* Both (Likely victory): I was thinking about who would be good back-up for Link, and Infinite is perfect. He can use his unavoidable pulses to create shields around Link, create clones to further block attacks, and if needed could send everyone else to Null Space (including Link but it would still be a win as long as the enemys don't have the power o friendship). But thats not the main reason he's here. I asked for Link to be given a bow sense he does use them all the time, however I left out arrows. This is because Infiinite can create Infinite Ancient arrows for him to use. Allowing for easy victory. (I understand if that last part isn't allowed though in fairness and fun, if not he creates bomb arrows)\n\nLINK to Link:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/d5m33i/respect\\_link\\_the\\_hero\\_of\\_the\\_wild\\_the\\_legend\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/d5m33i/respect_link_the_hero_of_the_wild_the_legend_of/)\n\nLink to Infinite:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/xxe6vp/respect\\_infinite\\_sonic\\_forces/](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/xxe6vp/respect_infinite_sonic_forces/)",

Her pinpoint accuracy at long and close-range is superhuman, being able to tag fast-moving targets like Deku in the rain from kilometers away, but her physical strength and durability are almost non-existent. She's the definition of a glass cannon. If Cable got close to her the best she'd be able to do is stagger him with her rifle before being pummeled or shot up, but if she manages to avoid Cable despite his telepathy and unyielding pursuit, she can nail him with her bullets, a single one of which is stronger than artillery and more than capable of blowing his brains out.\n\nTwice has a likely chance of winning against Deadpool. His ability to spawn 2 other teammates of his choice gives him insane versatility. He has a choice between Dabi with concentrated firepower, Shigaraki with the ability to decay anything he touches, Toga who can transform into other people by drinking their blood, Rappa who's a strong brute-force fighter capable of one-shotting Deadpool with a barrage, or Mr Compress who can compress anything he touches into a cube. The only downside of his clones is their fragility (injury equivelant to a broken bone will dissolve them), but he can reproduce them indefinitely. Deadpool can counter this production with good ol' spray & pray, but it's up for debate as to whether or not that would take Twice out quickly enough before he produces a lethal enough clone.\n\nAs a team Nagant and Twice are particularly lethal. Nagant's snipe skills are extremely potent up to a 3KM range, to the point where she can curve bullets around buildings and hit targets moving at high speeds in a city at night in the rain. Her bullets themselves are exceptionally powerful, blowing back a 30% Deku who's capable of bulldozing person-sized holes through buildings easily, and being stated superior to artillery. Twice's duplication abilities allow him to 2 doubles at once. He can create a false (yet equally powerful) Nagant in order to lead Cable and Deadpool astray or create clones of his fellow league members to go and scout or help defend Nagant. His ability is capable of adapting to any situation thrown at him. The downfall of this teamup is their lack of durability. Twice has roughly the durability of an athletic adult man, and Nagant isn't much better. If they take serious hits to their vitals, they're done for. Twice's clones also dissipate after taking damage equivalent to a broken bone, so despite their strength, they have no way of being reliable damage-soaks.\n\nRelevant scaling:\n\n[Deku](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/btn90w/respect_izuku_deku_midoriya_my_hero_academia/)  \n[Toga](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/o7miod/respect_himiko_toga_my_hero_academia/)  \n[Shiggy](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/cvzmlf/respect_tomura_shigaraki_my_hero_academia/)  \n[Dabi](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/o899x8/respect_dabi_my_hero_academia/)",

Unless he throws intentionally.\n\nKasparov gets checkmated by Tyson on purpose. He holds out for a week at most before giving in.",
            "They would probably never lose in their respective fields.\n\nAs many aspiring chess players have tragically found out, becoming a super GM like Kasparov is not just a matter of training. Tyson is already 21. Most GMs start learning chess when they are extremely young (age 6 for Kasparov). This fact already puts Tyson at an extreme disadvantage in terms of his learning ability. And even with unlimited time to train, most people just don't have the aptitude to become super GMs. That's a sad reality that many chess prodigies have to face eventually. In the same way that you could study 5x more than Einstein ever did and never be as smart as he was, you could train more than Kasparov and never reach his level of genius.\n\nI am less familiar with boxing, but I'd say it's a similar deal. It would take an inordinate amount of time for Kasparov to reach Tyson's level. Not just in terms of physical condition, but in terms of technique, knowledge, innate aptitude, and mental fortitude. Tyson is one of a kind.\n\nThey will both go insane before they lose in their fields. Tyson will never reach Kasparov's peak level, and Kasparov will never beat Tyson. The mental strain on the pair of them, faced with this endless sisyphean task, is too much.\n\nTLDR: If I had to choose, I'd say Tyson wins first. Eventually. Why? Because they both go mad in the time loop, faced with impossible tasks, and their mental deterioration is more detrimental to chess than it is to boxing. So, as Kasparov goes mad, Tyson becomes closer to his level in chess. Eventually Kasparov blunders.",

Even if he did start to learn the art of boxing, all it would do is help him maybe last a little longer.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can train to become a chess grandmaster but you can't train to become a freakishly large heavyweight. Realistically though it would take a long, long time before either beat the other at their own game.",
            "It never ends. Even if they get to accumulate experience/skill from doing it for eternity, both are genetically predisposed to have a higher intellectual and physical capacity respectively.

            "This prompt is pretty dumb, since its irrevocably biased towards Tyson. The punishment for Tyson every day is losing a game he doesn't really care about. I wouldn't even say that his punishment rises to the level of embarrassment, since it would be silly to be embarrassed about getting beaten at chess by Kasparov- especially when its not a game you even play or try to compete in. You might say the harshest punishment Tyson receives is boredom. Yawn.\n\nMeanwhile, Kasparov is physically brutalized on a daily basis. How are those even close to the same? Lets analyze it even further, natural physical advantages don't matter at all in chess. But Kasparov could be in the best shape of his life and he'll still never gain enough skill in boxing to overpower Tyson. Its a lose/lose for Kasparov where he has no chance of ever winning. Tyson not only has the naturally easier challenge (you can teach chess, you can't teach size and raw physical power), but he also has completely ho-hum consequences for failing while Kasparov is being terrorized.",
            "tbh even if we assume Kasparov isn't trapped in an eternal hell of daily body destruction after a round of unsatisfying chess, I have an easier time imagining Tyson somehow lucks into a game of chess he wins than Kasparov being able to KO Tyson.",

            "Mike. Kasparov can be a better boxer in every way but it wont matter because he will never be able to physically harm him. \n\nFor chess according to ELO if Mike can learn enough to get to 1500 he has a 0.06% (1 in 1779.28) of winning.",
            "mike wins, kasparov would give up. after a few nights... he'd just ok check mate me like this.",
            "Given an infinite loop and retained knowledge like Groundhog Day, Tyson will eventually learn enough patterns and strategies to at least be competitive against Kasparov. Kasparov will never compete with peak Tyson in the ring no matter how many times they fight and will probably become even less effective over time due to the mental toll and PTSD from getting battered every day.\n\nThis is literally a nightmarish torture scenario for Kasparov.",
            "Tyson has a temper. Kasparov could probably find a way to piss him off so much that Tyson goes to town on the ear and gets DQ'd.",

            "I'm assuming Kasparov falls down intentionally at the beginning of the boxing matches and throws the game. Kasparov then spends the morning beating Tyson in chess, leaves, and eventually figures out how to incapacitate Tyson in the afternoon before the boxing match starts, leading to a forfeit or easy defeat of Tyson. Kasparov would have to bide his time, to stop Tyson from suspecting anything, to learn his daily patterns. Drive a bulldozer into Tyson's gym, or shoot him before the boxing match starts.",

            "After the first day or two, Gary let's tyson checkmate him in the morning to avoid getting pummeled again in the evening",
            "Mike easily wins. Mike is going to learn chess way more easily than Garry is going to learn boxing. No amount of time looping is stopping Mike Tyson from knocking you out in one punch. It'd probably take 3+ years for Mike to get on Garry's level(Assuming Garry just doesn't forfeit chess from the pure abuse he will get in boxing)",
            "The first day starts, Tyson loses at chess. The scenario ends. What is the point of this question?",
            "A week seems really generous. I feel like two days is max.",
            "Tyson just eyeing him like a piece of meat every chess game, knowing he's going to lose.. just waiting to enjoy the evening. I give Kasparov one night, assuming Tyson's trash talk during the chess match doesn't make him surrender before that, because Gary knows what's coming and he's a smart guy.",
            "I like your approach, but would like to throw a counter angle: Kasparov throws the boxing match.\n\nIf he just flops as soon as the bell rings, covers his head, screams for the ref? He's \"KO'd\" or forfeited or whatever. He clearly doesn't want to fight and they're not going to make him because they *can't.*\n\nNow what do we do from here? We have a battle of wills between Tyson and Kasparov on who throws to get out of this eternal purgatory first. Tyson will effectively never beat Kasparov at chess; K is so far beyond him and K will see Tyson learn as he gets better, picking up his bad habits and noting them down.\n\nKasparov can start trying to figure out how to KO Tyson. His physical conditioning carries over. He can attempt on any day he feels like it and just NOPE any other day. \n\nI think he's got a very clear shot at the dub with this strategy.",
            "Lmao, I love this take. One solid liver hit from Tyson and Kasparov just folds the next morning.",
            "This is the correct take here",
            "Hm, I wonder if Gary could get around this by forfeiting before Mike even throws a punch for the first few thousand loops? The prompt specifies morning for the chess and evening for the boxing, which to me implies they'd both have some time in between to train themselves.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Once Gary's physically fit enough to actually withstand a few hits, he might be able to start taking rounds in the ring, and go back to forfeiting whenever he needs a psychological break. I guess this gives Tyson a pretty big lead in terms of actually learning the matchup in the game he has to win, but it might be preferable to the alternatives of a) getting beat up every night or b) giving up on this loop scenario entirely (maybe the loser of the challenge gets deleted from reality or something idk).",
            "This probably happens in the second day tbf",
            "Man, Kasparov would have the be *resurrected* every evening to continue.",
            "It would take a while before Kasparov even gets to a point where he remembers the pummelings TBH. Tyson could probably one-hit kill (not KO, literally kill) him. If Kasparov gets any physical conditioning out of that it\u2019ll be developing incredible cardio from running away.",
            "Love the concept of insanity fucking them over in the end.\n\nI bet they'd both be very bored with each other too. Mike is basically fighting tissue paper and Kasp is playing tick tac toe against a toddler.\n\nHonestly, in competitive video games, I find I improve the most when I play against people just above my skill level. If I play against someone exceptionally better, I really don't have a chance to improve. I doubt either of them could make the inroads needed against each other for the same reasons.",
            "Nah I'd say kasparov wins. If he can get like 3 lucky hits then he could win but Tyson has to get like 20+ lucky moves to win",
            "The thing is that Kasparov don't need to be Tyson's level to win a boxing match. Tyson just needs to slip up once and Kasparov landing a good hit and it is over. \n\nKasparov would have to fuck over and over again to lose in chess. Even under extreme stress he could probably dominate a pretty skilled chess player.",
            "i don\u2019t think a full power Kasparov punch can knock Tyson out. he would need to out point him while not losing. which would take forever\u00a0",
            "This is the correct answer. \n\nKasparov throws the chess match on the first day, in order to avoid getting killed in the afternoon.",
            "you can win a boxing match by luck only if the fighters are similarly skilled. Kasparov has no chance in hell of ever koing Mike, he doesn't have the power or the technique to put his flimsy 80kg weight behind his punches.",

            "Kaaparov is like 2800 elo and I'd say the average elo of a normal person is 800. I thunk it's around only a 300 elo difference for a 100% winrate. That's 1700 over the guaranteed win",
            "maybe you're underestimating kasparov's will and drive. his matches with karpov were also a daily challenge but he persevered",
            "If TKOs are allowed then Kasparov could also luck into a win via a Tyson injury, which I think is more likely to happen than a checkmate or a proper KO.",
            "Kasparov gets to keep his physical improvements, though? He'll eventually get into a good enough shape to be try for fluke wins.\n\n\nTyson will never be able to fluke win Kasparov. Heck, OP doesn't even specify if Tyson gets to keep his memories of the game.",
            "I'm 2000 and I genuinely think I would never beat Kasparov even with a million games, there's a better chance Mike slips and knocks himself out than him beating Kasparov",
            "Nah it's closer to 0% if kasparov is always in perfect condition for the chess game",
            "> It'd probably take 3+ years for Mike to get on Garry's level\n\nIt typically takes 8-12 years for a chess player to reach the grandmaster title. And most grandmasters start out very young when they learn faster. As a 21 year old adult beginner the odds are very low of a player ever reaching grandmaster no matter how much training and practice they do. And of course, some people no matter how young they start or how much they train never achieve grandmaster. It's a very difficult title to get and not everyone is capable of doing it.\n\nAnd prime Garry Kasparov eats grandmasters for breakfast.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Tyson never gets on Kasparov's level. That doesn't mean Tyson can never win, a regular 2500 GM has a very low chance of beating Kasparov but it's not zero. Even a 2000, which is very achievable for an adult beginner, has a non-zero chance. Statistically Tyson will pull off a win eventually, unless he just straight up doesn't try to learn chess at all.",
            "you misread the question",
            "Seriously, peak Tyson was fucking terrifying. I give Gary one night before he throws as he is a smart dude, he will quickly identify that this is a no win scenario for him",

            "\"Absolutely not, I quit\"",

            "3 lucky hits from a guy like kasparov will never even tickle Tyson. Mike tanked bombs from champions with strength and genetics that Kasparov can never even dream of reaching.",
            "One good hit? Tyson has tanked hundreds of blows from actual professional boxers just fine.\n\nKasparov isn\u2019t capable of generating that kind of power to OHKO maybe the greatest boxer of all time",

            "Given infinite tries and given that he gets stronger and stronger, eventually K will be able to eek out a fluke victory over T.\n\nT will never ever eek out a fluke victory over K in chess. That's now how the game works at higher levels.",
            "I tend agree honestly. Its either an eternal stalemate or it takes hundreds or even thousands of years to resolve. Maybe even more, who knows.",
            "Indeed, my logic was that there could be some tiny percentage chance that Tyson could become high enough level to eventually take one game, but Kasparov can never become as big and strong as Mike.\n\n\nThe nature of chess perhaps allows for this as well. Given infinite time tyson and garry will have played through every known opening and played every variation of it, multiple times even. Tysons chances are still so low that it would require a miracle essentially. The more I think about it the more I suspect it would simply be an eternal battle with no winners.",
            "I'm taking it you think ELO being accurate is more compelling than say ELO is not accurate?",

Glad I added the +\n\nThe only reason it might take a shorter time(not anywhere below 5 years) for Mike to win is because he's solely playing against Garry Kasporov maning he'll develop his moves purely on countering Garry's moves, pretty unlikely though.",
            "Peak Tyson was also unhinged because he would not take his meds before the fight. Imagine you are about to fight the scariest fighter on the planet and just hours before you beat him like a small child in chess. I would think about that beating I would receive later in the day and just throw the first chess match to be honest.",
            "I think the chances of kasparov ohko on Tyson is about the same as Tyson scoring a 10 move win on Kasparov if kasparov isn't throwing.",
            "> greatest boxer of all time\n\nNot even remotely. He was good, probably even great, but that is about it.",
            "What? With injuries carrying over and no time to recover, he's fucked",
            "I think it would end with Kasparov winning. Because eventually he would learn how to throw a pretty good punch, and Tyson would just need to slip up to make it land. Kasparov doesn't have to anywhere near as strong, fast or big as a heavyweight boxer to win it. A regular person's punch is good enough *if* they can throw a good punch and it lands in the correct spot. The skill in boxing is making good punches and avoiding them. \n\nWhereas Kasparov would have to fuck up over and over again to let someone that much worse than him win a chess game and I think Kasparov would get his lucky win before Tyson grinds his way to grandmaster, especially since Kasparov would probably know how Tyson plays even better than Tyson himself does at that point, and pretty much every move Tyson would learn is also from Kasparov. There is no room surprises there.",
            ">Tysons chances are still so low that it would require a miracle essentially.\n\nAccording to an online elo calculator I found a 2000 rated player, which is very achievable for an adult beginner, has about a 1 in 5000 chance of beating peak Garry Kasparov. So after a few years of playing and learning Tyson will only need a few tens of thousands more games to have a good statistical chance of pulling off at least one win.\n\nBut I don't think Kasparov is so incapable of becoming big and strong. He's only an inch shorter than Tyson, and while he'll never be AS big and strong as Tyson I think he can get close enough to have a puncher's chance long before they've played enough games for Tyson to likely have a win.",
            "Nope especially with huge discrepancies but it can happen. Also you dont learn shit from getting destroyed in boxing but you'll learn chess from playing 3000 games against Kasparov",
            "A puncher's chance is always there.\n\nAnd you say your brain isn't capped, but you'd be surprised. Tyson is 21 in this prompt. People who didn't start on chess early on basically never become grandmasters - their brain isn't wired the same way. Just like how people who learn music as kids are better at math, or how adults suck at learning new languages.\n\nAdult brains are better at synthesizing information logically, but they're comparably terrible at actually acquiring new skills. The plasticity has gone and been replaced by crystallization. \n\nI want to loop back around: a puncher's chance is always there. Boxing matches can end in just one punch. It might be in the third round but a KO is a KO. There's absolutely nothing comparable in chess; good players can see problems coming from many turns away.",
            "I don't think he needs to train to the point where he can hurt Tsyon, he just needs to be able to survive for a little while. If he can make the fight last 30 seconds then with enough loops there would eventually be a fight where Tyson suffers a debilitating injury (like he slips on the ring and fucks his knee up or something) and gives Garry the win. This only works if TKOs count though.",
            "If Kasparov fucks up he'll recover though, there's no shot he hangs mate in one",
            "GMs often prepare against specific opponents. Having an opponent plan to counter your specific playstyle and moves is normal and expected at Kasparov's level.\n\nI think Tyson reaches the 2000 level after a few years of play, and after that a few thousand more games should statistically get him at least one win.",
            "What kind of insane take is this.",
            "The prompt said conditioning. Not condition. That means he gets magically healed up and retains his fitness and strength gains.\n\n\nI think eventually he gets strong enough to withstand a few of Tyson's hits. Then it just becomes a statistical game of waiting for Mike to step awkwardly or throw a punch weirdly or something and hurt himself. Could take millions of fights though.",
            "one good punch won\u2019t be enough though\u00a0",
            "If Kasparov can get stronger I agree with you, OP specified his conditioning remains the same between fights tho. If not for that I would definitely say Garry wins first",
            "You're going to learn more from getting destroyed in boxing than you are from getting destroyed by a GM in chess.\n\nTyson MIGHT get a bit better about avoiding early game mates, but he's never ever ever going to be able to compete with him past the midgame.",
            "Kasparov could take a run up with Mike sticking his chin out and still not ko him, he doesn\u2019t have the mass or explosive athleticism needed to ko Tyson.",
            "I mean, Ding Liren did recently hang mate in two against Magnus. But obviously you'd need to be a strong GM to even get into that position against someone like Ding Liren (or Kasparov).",
            "There's more to losing in one move than mate lol. Especially if Tyson gets around 1800 which he probably will if he's playing chess for infinity.",
            "I'm sorry but if you think Tyson is the greatest boxer of all time then you are clearly not a boxing fan.",
            "but he won't get any conditioning in an actual match, that comes from training, not by having your ribs broken or your liver ruptured. \n\nin every fight against tyson, Kasparov will be at the edge of suvival, he can learn nothing as he lacks even the fundamentals of boxing to improve on. There really isn't an ascending trajectory for him in this scenario, while Mike can actually become better at chess with time.",
            "People keep saying this, but it's false. Have you never heard of a puncher's chance before?",
            "That's just not true. If I get fools mated I learn how to defend the fools mate, if I catch a right hook that teaches me nothing.",
            "Yes he does. He's a fully abled adult man. Mike's chin came from his incredible head movement, not from some supernatural concussion-resistant ability he has.\n\nA skull is a skull, a brain is a brain.",
            "True true but also Ding is probably going through stuff",
            "My point is there's no other way he loses due to a fuck up cause if it's not mate in oneKasparov will save it",
            "I'm making and assumption, but I believe Gary has time each day when he's not in the ring or at the chess board, where be can train and do drills learn about boxing, watch videos etc (same as how Mike can think about the chess games and probably study chess books. If neither of them can do these things then the prompt is ridiculous since it'd just be the same scenario each day with no improvement from either guy).\n\n\nSo those conditionings carry over, plus his magical healing after each fight. So having ribs broken or liver ruptured is irrelevant. He could die in the ring on day 5 and come day 6 morning would be restored to his fitness at the beginning of round 1 of day 5.",
            "It's the part in the post that says Kasparov keeps his conditioning between battles that bothers me. I don't know how strong he is but something tells me the answer is: far below average. I don't know if he even has the power to shut Tysons lights off with just one blown. Think of fighters like Max Holloway for example - world champion fighter, far stronger than the average man his size, certainly stronger than Kasparov several times over, and even he rarely lands knockout blows against other featherweight, let alone a heavyweight with a jaw as solid as Tysons.",
            "> If I get fools mated I learn how to defend the fools mate\n\nA fool's mate is extraordinarily basic. I'd hope you'd learn how to defend against that after it landing on you. How do you learn to defend against an 8-turn-staged fork when it's begun after you've chosen your opening?\n\n> if I catch a right hook that teaches me nothing.\n\nReally?\n\n*Really*?\n\nYou learn NOTHING from getting punched in the face?",

            "Sure. I'm not arguing Kasparov will learn enough to beat Tyson. But he may (emphasis on may as in I'm NOT saying even likely) get fit enough to run away for long enough that Tyson trips and falls for example (maybe one in a billion chances, so it MAY take a billion days in this scenario).\u00a0",
            "there is 0% chance of that happening. He can't outrun Tyson in the ring even if he would be faster. Usain bolt would not be able to run away in the ring from a mediocre pro boxer, let alone one of the GOATs.\n\nKasparov only chance, as someone else mentioned, is for him to instantly concede the fight the moment the bell rings and transform this into a battle of willpower, as in who gets bored or goes insane first.\n\nif he is forced to actually fight, Kasparov would give up on this first, a few days tops, as he would be incapable of taking the beating of his lifetime every single night. Getting beaten into deaths door will have a major psychological impact, whereas losing a chessmatch every day is like meh."

            "Cannons are nothing compared to the 15 in' guns on the Bismarck. Hell the ships would get eviscerated by the secondary battery long before they got close enough put a Cannon ball on the deck. Maybe if they were able to coordinate in a manner that all of the guns couldn't possibly reload fast enough to get them all they could board the Bismarck somehow. But even on board they would be heavily outgunned by generic self defense weaponry. Even 1 guy with a Mauser could kill 6 guys before they got him. I just can't see a scenario in which the Bismarck somehow loses this. It's literally a giant impregnable fortress armed with bigger guns than they've ever seen, faster than they can comprehend, armor so thick that anything they throw at it will literally bounce off. And crewed by more men than 6 or 7 of their ships combined.",
            "Naval forces underwent one of the most dramatic Revolutions in Military Affairs in all world history when, in the 1860s, France and England both developed the \"ironclad\" concept. To say the Ironclad made every naval vessel before it obsolete may be an understatement. The ironclad was such fertile ground for rapid technological improvement that a new ironclad built in 1865 would ITSELF become obsolete by a newer ironclad built in 1870.\n\nNot ineffective. Not second-rate. \n\nObsolete. In 5 years. \n\nThis process of uncontrolled advancement continued until the Dreadnaughts appear at the turn of the century, at which point things slowed from a frantic pace to a rapid pace. Three more decades after that the Bismarck left the drydock.\n\nThe only thing that would stop this hypothetical Bismarck from ruling the entire world in the 1700s would be that it can only be in one place at a time.",

            "The only way I see the world's navies winning is if they're able to detonate a hulk filled with gunpowder close enough to Bismark to jam his rudder or propeller shaft.  Surprise would be key.  I'm going to say this is only possible in R2 where the sail navy gets time to plan their trap.\n\nThe engagement must happen in confined waters where Bismark cannot run at maximum speed, and also in a place with prevalent mists that could conceal the hulk until it is too late.  Some brief googling says that a 1700s east indiaman could carry in the 100-300 ton range, and gunpowder contains 62% of the energy of the same mass of TNT.  So lets say we have an explosive with the energy equivalent of about 100 tons of TNT.  Given the impact of two 2-ton mines on Tirpitz were enough to damage her rudder and knock turret-dora off its bearings, if the 100t hulk can be detonated next to Bismark it might be enough to render the ship combat ineffective.  There are extremely long odds that this happens, and relies on the Kriegsmarine sailors to be overconfident and underestimate their technologically inferior opponent, resulting in an obsolete weapon sinking their ship.  So it's possible.\n\nProbably requires the rest of the 1700s navy to be sacrificed to work, though.  I'm thinking they disguise the hulk by having a bunch of other hulks get created by Bismark, so it isn't suspicious when it has to sail through a strait choked with wrecks.",
            "Possibly the only thing the 1700's fleet could do is hope to swarm the bismark with boarders armed with cutlasses.",
            "Even with 10 years warning there just isn't the technology to create something that can pierce that level of armor. This was actually the panic that was the dreadnaught racd. It turned naval power on its head precisely because no amount  of pre-dreadnaught era ships matter anymore, because you could bring 50 pre-dreadnaughts vs 1 dreadnaught and they stood no chance. The Bismarck is beyond that of even a dreadnaught, so yeah no weapons can even hope to take it. \n\nOk so let's not try to fight it, let's just send everyone max speed to board. The fastest age of the discovery ship is going to be about 14 knots. The Bismarck can go 40 knots. \n\nSo you can't fight it, nor can you just rush it, can you outlast it? The main battery had roughly 1000 shells according to Wikipedia. The British navy had about 130 ships battleships and 150 cruises in 1800. Considering even secondary batteries and AA could be used to take out most of the age of sail I think the Bismarck would be fine there. \n\nSo at this point the question is the world economy just focused on building big fast ships build like 10,000 ships in 10 years and train people to fight to just run the Bismarck out of ammo and chase until they run out of food and fuel. I have no idea. But even if they could it doesn't really doesn't feel like the point of the question.\n\nSo no real amount of prep really allows them to get ahead of this. The Bismarck is mountains ahead.",

A fleet of fireships might pose a tiny threat as well, or a fleet of bombships equiped with a mortar. But that's only for the earliest ironclads.\n\nBy the 1880s something like a protected cruiser would, for all intents and purposes, be invulnerable short of some innovative stratagem of war. No boarding, no ramming, no gun or explosives from the 1700s would be capable of inflicting actual damage (Aside from miscellaneous uarmoured superstructures).",

            "> because you could bring 50 pre-dreadnaughts vs 1 dreadnaught and they stood no chance.\n\nThe force disparity wasn't THAT great. There were predreadnought battleships with 12 inch guns comparable to the Dreadnought's main battery. The Dreadnought just had more of them. Other improvements to the Dreadnought and following designs (like better engines or larger guns) could have been applied to predread ships if they had kept being built.\n\nTwo or three predreadnoughts should be a match for an early dreadnought battleship. Probably not enough to destroy it, because dreadnoughts were faster and could just disengage and leave, but enough to prevent it from carrying out a mission or force their own mission to completion.",
            "Doesn't matter.\n\n\nThe 1700s ships are designed to lob cannon balls at wooden ships, at a range of 50-200 yards.\n\n\nThe Bismark was designed to destroy armored steel-hulled ships at a range of no greater than 22 miles.\n\n\nAt best, the 1700's ships can hope to do is ram the Bismark and try to clog its propellers with wreckage.",

While they would become a popular cheap littoral and floating battery option for all navies for a couple decades, they would prove to be a technological dead-end as the designs lacked the inherent speed and seaworthiness desired by first-rate navies to project power around the world and conduct complex operations in all possible theaters. The traditional hulled ironclads are what would develop into the later protected and armored cruisers, which would be the predecessor to modern capital ships.",
            "That's fair. I may have been thinking more about the WW1 era dread naughts which weren't the first dreadnaught.\n\nRegardless the Bismarck is many evolutions beyond that so it holds true that no amount of age of sail can overwhelm it",

            "Oh absolutely no age of sail ship is a threat to the Bismark. I'd think even late predreads could defeat any number of wooden sailships if given infinite ammo and maintenance. And the Bismark probably defeats any number of late predreads.",
            "This boarding argument always comes up when old ships are pitted against modern ones and it's complete nonsense for many reasons.\n\n1. The Bismarck has a top speed of 30 knots compared to 8 knots at most favourable conditions, and speed difference of just 3 knots is enough to dictate range in naval combat.\n2. Sail ships can't even approach the Bismarck if wind isn't in their favour\n3. Bismarck's freeboard is twice the height of biggest ships and a lot taller than any smaller frigates, there is no possible way to get on the deck even if the ship was not defending itself.\n4. The amount of secondaries, including AA guns makes boarding impossible. The short bursts of 20-37mm guns at exposed decks of old ships will kill everyone onboard, and Bismarck had 28 of them. The bigger 15 and 10.5cm guns will also kill any boarders with shockwave alone and destroy any wooden ship at that range without hitting it.\n5. Even if enemy crew somehow got past the AA guns, the hatches on a modern battleship are made of several inches thick steel and sealed shut. 1700 tech has no way of breaching in. And the whole ship is compartmentalized into small sections each with its' own closed bulkhead that downtimers have no way of breaching.\n6. If the crew can somehow breach the ship, they'll have to fight through long hallways several football fields long, against entrenched enemy armed with bolt action rifles and SMGs. They essentially have to cross the no-man's land on 6 seperate decks before they can get to machinery or anything important-\n\n\\^ This is why boarding became impossible and inpractical once steam ships entered service, because all important machinery and means of taking control of the ship are located deep below, boarding party can't just defeat the crew, rig the sails, take the wheel and sail the ship immediately.",
            "I'm not sure you could ever reasonably expect to board with enough dudes with cutlasses to beat the dudes with Stg 44s and MP 40s.",
            "Yeah, but first: how ? The Bismarck deck is way too high to just jump on. The secondary armement will obliterate any large warship, and the tertiary any small ones. \n\nAnd even then, thr Bismarck can reach thirty knots, a sailing ship of that period would be fast at ten",
            "They can't catch it to do that though.  It isn't the raw speed that matters here, it is that Bismark can go any direction such as against the wind.",

            "I think that's where preparation time is necessary for all the navies in the world. First off the bismarks freeboard is only about 6m at the waist which is definitely boardable either from the rigging or via grappling hooks and ladders or deck to deck for larger frigates. Secondly just the massive numbers advantage. \n\nNow your very correct, it's gonna be nearly impossible, the Bismarck is way too fast to be caught up with if it tries to escape and the secondary battery would wreck wooden ships, possibly even better than the primary battery. \n\nI think the only chance the wooden navies have is luring the Bismarck into a tight quarters like a fjord or narrow bay using it's bloodlusted need to destroy them and then boarding the Bismarck probably from small boats they can row up. \n\nAgain you make a good point, modern weapons and ship layouts would be a massacre below decks. But the bridge would be stormable with heavy casualties. The Bismarck crew could retain control of the engine room, and probably even the steering gears but they would be unable to navigate out of the fjord without being able to see outside. So either they get starved out or run the ship aground attempting to escape the trap \n\nTldr; wooden navies only chance is basically modern piracy strategies. They're not winning anything at sea",

            "In theory, yes.  In practice, the Bismark is so much faster that it decides when and where every engagement happens, and could just plow right through the encirclement.",
            "The secondary guns can't really do much to hit people that are already on board. At best they could shoot at people on the bow or stern of the Bismarck, but people near the superstructure will be safe...minus hearing loss. Besides that, a battleships armor isn't super thick everywhere. The belt armor is thick, but the superstructure is probably no more that 1\" steel in most places. The old navy could try and bring gunpowder aboard to create a breech in the steel to get inside the ship. The old navy probably couldn't breech the armored citadel, but if the Bismarck crew is trapped in the citadel then they'll just starve to death. \n\nStill, this is only relevant if the Bismarck is stupid enough to let people get aboard.",
