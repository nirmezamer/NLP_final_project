        "content": "Hey gang,\n\nAfter a lot of feedback from the community, we have decided to ban comprehensive review posts from the subreddit. Before you get the pitchforks out, hear us out as to the why.\n\n**First, let's define a comprehensive review post.** It's a post in which the author lays out everything they like and dislike about the game in a manner similar to a media outlet giving a review.\n\n**Okay, so what's so bad about that?** Well, there are a few things. For starters, these posts have been flooding the subreddit and not really doing anything to advance discussion of the game. They're not very actionable for the devs to make changes. And they just get people fighting over the same shit every day.\n\n**But you're censoring our dissent!** No, we're not. We're focusing it. You have a gripe with a particular system in the game? Make a post about that system. Break down what you like and dislike about shipbuilding or NPC interactions or inventory management or power acquisition. THAT post will drive actionable feedback that the devs can use.\n\nIf you still want to pretend you're Paul Tassi and write a 500 word magnum opus on the 10 things you wish you'd known before playing Bethesda's latest game, we recommend starting a blog OR you can just leave it in the comments.\n\nKind regards,\n\nThe /r/Starfield Mod Team",

            "As a note, there was a point where statistically 60% of the posts over a 48 hour period were either long winded reviews consisting of \"I played for 300 hours and....\" \"I love\" or \"I hate\", OR, posts complaining about those types of posts. There was also a lot of \"i don't like that opinion, so I will make a troll post that counters it\". It adds nothing beneficial to the conversation, and just adds to toxic behavior from both sides.\n\nWhen that takes up a majority of the subreddit, people are downvoting a majority of them, and there's a large amount of posts complaining (or....complaining about the complaining?) We decided this was the best option to allow actual content to easier flow through and become visible. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with an opinion, but there are constructive ways to do things, and there are ways that just bait, flame, and create a toxic environment.",
            "The reviews around here were considered \"comprehensive\"?",
            "**I read this thread for 200+ hours, and my taste has soured.**\n\nAt first, I really enjoyed this thread. It seems well thought out and reasonable. But as I read, something sort of shifted for me. Even when restarting the thread from a new account, nothing changes. Every word is the same, all of the comments feel repetitive. There\u2019s no intrigue, nothing for me to come back and work on.\n\nThere\u2019s no combat because everyone is so agreeable, and the mechanics suck since they ditched third party apps. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good post for the first 100+ hours or so, but after that there\u2019s really nothing to keep coming back to. It makes me feel like I\u2019m wasting my time somehow, like what was the point of spending 4 days reading one thread? Where\u2019s the pay off? What did I even neglect my wife for?\n\nOverall, I\u2019d rate the post a 10/0, much needed and really paving the way for better posts, but I wouldn\u2019t pay $70 for it.",

It's not actually taking away from the enjoyment of this sub. \n\nI get annoyed seeing \"LOOK AT MAH CUSTOM SHIP!!!!\" and guess what? I just scroll past the post.",
            "Time to start posting incomprehensive reviews! Mwahahaha.\n\nHere's my washing machine's Starfield review:\n\n*WUM WUM WUM WUM WUM*\n\n.....\n\n*WUM WUM WUM*\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n*WUM*",

            "Finally, goddamn lol. I appreciate you giving them as long as you did, but yeah, it's been long enough",
            "With regards to 'Actionable feedback', do we know that Bethesda are actually reading or actioning the feedback from here?\n\nI only bring it up because In every thread about updates everyone just starts listing their problems like a shopping list that Bethesda are going to print out and hand to their devs.\n\nAnd so far we have had no communication from Bethesda side",
            "Anyone who could actually write their magnum opus in *500* words or less is probably crazy or a god.",
            "Will you be enforcing this equally for both positive and negative posts?  Will any criteria that is required for posts about something that someone disliked about the game also be required for posts about something someone enjoyed about the game?",
            "This was an excellent decision, well done team",
            "I'm not sure why I can't make any post but just comment existing posts. What's the issue?\n\nAnyway since I can't make a new post I will write the post here.\n\nI was shocked when I found out I couldn't walk far away from tmy ship. At one point the gane doesn't allow you to go further.\nSaid so, this game hase a huge amount of problems.\nSome of these are in the outposts. I feel the system is bugged. Transfers reaources between outposts are kind of bugged and also not having options that can be useful,  for example if an outposts has the storage full why the ship keep goingback and forward? In the tranfer screen I can see the resources available but what is for the area for the resources needed? I didn't find any way to use that. Outpost editor in many cases in aerial view the editor stops to work and once it happens in an outposts it will always happen, need to get out of the building mode and build just in first person. The game has an horrible system to store resources, where everything goes around and mix up, very difficult to find anything. No platforms to build to reach containers expanded vertically, how it is supposed a player check the containers if they are high? Transfers between the outposts and the ship is pretty horrible, the transfer co tainer becomes full then need to get out of it and enter again to make it empty, it is not dynamic. No way to transfer on the contrary, from the outposts to the ship for what I could see so far, I need to overload myself and bring stuff... overall the storage system is very confusing and not user friendly.",
            "This is a good change.  \n\nMaking posts about specific parts of the game actually drives focused discussion as opposed to all the hyperbolic, broad love or hate posts that do nothing but invite controversy. \n\nI'm sure that stuff will still happen in the comments both ways but there's no reason we need hundreds of 'reviews' every single day as if each person's review is worth reading.\n\nUpvotes and downvotes are bad indicators of quality content/posts so some regulation needs to happen.",
            "Based",
            "Your post also didn\u2019t mention by far the most annoying part about these so called \u201creview posts\u201d \n\nThey are SOOOOOOOO fucking self important. Like. You are not a good writer. Nor are you an exceptional person. We do not care to read like 3,000 words about what you think about this game. We get it, you want to be a games journalist. You want your opinion to matter. But WE DO NOT CARE. Want to discuss shit? Leave a comment, like everyone else.\n\nThanks for making this change",
            "THANK YOU. I was just thinking about making a post requesting this earlier this week. I'm glad you had already thought it over.",

            "Thank you",
            "Bout damn time",
            "Sort of related but what about a \u201cBethesda Please\u201d type of ongoing weekly post that is a list of common community requests like what other subs like r/halo do? If we want an organized list of  actionable items for Bethesda, that sounds like the best way to go. Plus, it would give people an outlet to discuss ideas versus flooding the sub with near identical posts.",

            "Honestly in general I dont get all the hate towards starfield or the comparison to Phantom Liberty the 3year in the works Cyberpunk2077 bandaid.\n\nFirstly \n\nStarfield is a Bethesda game in space and people who expected more and got caught up in the hype are at fault. Do I wish it was better in certain aspects sure (especially outposts only time when I crash and skill tree) but I still like the games feel. Combat is nice and impactfull allthough meele is kinda garbage.\n\nSecondly\n\nI dont understand the constant comparisons to Cyberpunk2077 a game that launched so badly that Sony pulled it off their stores.   \nA game where :  \n\n\n1. not a single of your choices has any consequences besides the main story\n2.  you kill 100000 of one gang you still get jobs for that gang \n3. your friendship to the best mate you had in the city was just a cutscene\n4. Police spawning in walls\n5. Not 1 feature a typicall RPG of that genre at launch (barber, tattoo artists, tuning etc.)\n6. Lifepaths that dont actually matter at all as you all start the same\n7. etc.\n\nLike yeah they managed to fix the game 3 years later but some of the points above still are the same.\n\nIn Starfield I actually got a game that runs well, lets me roleplay and actually had a good 100h+ hours in the game.",
            "The amount of comments that needed to be removed here is wild",

Break down what you like and dislike about shipbuilding or NPC interactions or inventory management or power acquisition. THAT post will drive actionable feedback that the devs can use.\n\nThe problem with this is that this is a game that's built on complex interplay of systems.  \n\nIt's not a set of discrete minigames.",
            "As long as I can continue to see prime content like \"I just learned you can shoot open these emergency doors!\" I'll be totally fine.",
            "Can I suggest adding a feedback flair as a substitute?\n\nThat way people can focus their complains on a specific area and actually provide some ideas for fixing or improving on them, does providing a more constructive approach to it where the rest of the community can also give their input on that specific point.\n\nPlus, if any Bethesda devs are checking the Reddit, it may be easier for them to look for such threads where a problem is identified and potential solutions proposed.",
            "wow, I'm actually surprised. \n\nPerhaps you can add a flare for Bug report, as well as QoL request. I think a lot of people just don't know where to go with these things, and/or think the angry american tactic will work. \n\nJust a idea, not hard pressed otherwise. Good job mods.",

            "Bummer. How can one educate themselves on what is considered \"actionable feedback\" for game developers? And is it something that is universally agreed upon by all studios, or is different for every studio? I'm asking because I genuinely want better games. I don't want to just complain into the void.",
            "Well said. Take my upvote. You know what I'd like to see? The thing I'm aiming at in 3rd person and not the mountains 100m behind me when I pull up my scope. :p This is just a classic Bethesda game. I'm sure you guys are aware of the faults and will sort it out eventually. I will say that I'm sad I haven't been launched into space during combat. (psst...feel free to sneak in a \"feature\" that launches us into space during combat. Mum's the word. >;} ) Edit: I just realized how old this post is. Oh well.",

            "Good. Was getting tired of all the useless reviewers on their soapboxes. If I cared about that I'd read Steam reviews.",
            "Most of these seemed like they were written by the same person anyways, or at least a group that had coordinated exactly what they were going to post and how they would word it, in a copy-paste sort of way. Others seemed like they were written by Chat GPT.",
            "This is great news! Half the time I avoid this sub even though I love the game because I got tired of seeing this person or that person's nit picking of the game. I think this is a smart move that will likely result in me not avoiding a sub about one of my favorite games as much.",
            "Could you maybe put up one stickied megathread for people to post these sort of opinion pieces? That way folk get to feel they've had their say, but the sub also doesn't get cluttered up?",
            "Idk, any time I review the game I always point out things that I liked and why I liked them, also how they can be further improved. I also post the flip side, the negatives and what I believe should be done about those things. Like, the copy/paste PIOs, with every facility of the same name being identical, that's a simple fix by rearranging the layouts and enemy spawns, interior designs, etc.",
            "Praise the Great Serpent!",
            "Awesome I was super close to unfollowing because I was learning nothing new from this subreddit. Thank you.",
            "Good. Those damn things may as well have been a copypasta, anyway, as they were mostly all the same.",
            "Now go tell every other game sub mod to do the same thing",
            "Great to hear, and I understood that it must be difficult coming to this decision. I have to deal with a ton of trolls just to dare suggest this change but ultimately, I think most of them just don't realise that this is simply a good house keeping practice. Preventing a flood of the same topic from overwhelming the subreddit is just a best practice that keep the space organised and fun to interact with.",

            "This is pretty much why NoSodiumStarfield got so popular. There was so much gd negativity on this sub. I really hope this helps.\n\nHad to have been a hard decision for the mods to come down with this decision, but it was really needed.",
            "The mod team doing what mod teams should do - set the tone for the sub.\n\nWhilst I don't have an issue just ignoring these posts, positive or negative, I'm more than happy for this being a rule going forward so long as you update the rules to accommodate this.",
            "Can we do a comprehensive review on all the comprehensive reviews?",
            "Yay!",
            "That last paragraph made me chuckle. Its definitely true",
            "I know mods gets dunked on a lot, and to be honest not every sub has good mods, but I think this is a great idea, and demonstration of good leadership. As someone who also creates digital media, you couldn\u2019t be more right that big generalized blog like posts aren\u2019t at all the kind of feedback you need from your community to help you improve their experience. They do read more like influencer type posts focused on the writers personality than specific aspects of the game. Also the online discussion is way more interesting when it\u2019s directed towards a specific aspect of the game, like the skill trees, or modding, or whatever. I much more enjoy this subreddit when I get to hear peoples thoughts on that.",
            "Good. We absolutely didn't need anymore of those.\n\nIs Starfield a perfect game? No. Should Bethesda have gotten us more patches by now? Yes. Neither of those mean everyone needs to write an essay about why they're unhappy that this isn't TES6.",
            "So basically you're no longer letting people post negative opinions about the game while letting nothing but the positive be heard. \"We don't like what you have to say so we aren't letting you say it.\" What does the positive feedback give the devs again other than a pat on the back? What exactly is being added in that?",
            "Thank you! I almost left the sub more than once because i just don't care about random strangers' five paragraph breakdown of the game.",
            "Fucking finally",
            "Woo! Good to hear. I really love the game and look forward to (hopefully) seeing well thought out posts about the game and its mechanics moving forward",
            "Thank god",
            "God bless you",
            "Thank you, I look forward to seeing more creative content in the future now.",
            "Thank the Lord. It will be easier to actually locate bug specific posts instead of scrolling past all the giant rants that are posted.",
            "But what if I saw an opinion about the game in another review that makes me feel the need to post my own review defending my beloved game? I NEED to post that it's a 10/10 best game ever to counter that 8/10 I saw earlier.",
            "Thank the Todds that this has finally ended. It essentially became a copy-paste of the exact same format to whine about the same reasons why they aren't having fun. No one gives a damn, these people need to touch some grass and move on with their lives",
            "good stuff, sounds like a decent improvement",
            "I'm good with this",
            "Thanks Mods!\n\nAlso, I feel like watching the Yelp reviews episode of South Park for some weird reason\u2026(shrug)",

They're not very actionable for the devs to make changes\n\n\nIt seems that you guys have exclusive, direct feedback from the game developers telling you that these threads are not actionable for them. Otherwise this would merely be guessing and taken out of the mod team buttocks, which is surely not the case, of course. \n\nHow was this done? Do you guys have a direct line of communication with the game developers? Are any devs in the mod team?\n\n\nAnd now that we know that the devs are directly communicating with the mod team here, letting you guys know what threads to accept or not for feedback, what kind of guarantee is the community going to have that you guys are actually remaining impartial and won't do things in order to appease them to the detriment of the community?",

            "This only makes sense if Bethesda is actually using these posts to narrow in on action items. Else, it's just stifling those who do want to write novels, as of course, Reddit has the easy way of just not upvoting/downvoting a post and it dies on the vine. I bet if I search by New there's so many posts that will never make it to my front page as they're not worth a discussion. \n\nWithout typing novel myself, this has always felt like a one-way street of a sub where the users are shouting into a valley and only hearing their own voices. If this is actually a sub where Bethesda will interact, even if only a random post a a week, then there's an incentive to actually going into detail.\n\nIf this is just \"I'm a mod and I hate these posts so I'm banning these posts now\" then shit, this is on-brand with how these subs go....\n\nBasically, I don't think anyone wants to get anywhere near the \"BUNGIE PLEASE\" realm of life, but for damn sure it's only been a few generic Todd Howard posts since the launch unless devs are hiding under cloakes in their replies.",

Others have been building communities for other games and developers, and we understand the nuance to what is useful and what isn't over time.

We have had posts specifically stating this openly in Fallout communites that there has never in a single case EVER where Bethesda has contacted us to ask for a removal or anything similar, even during leaks, as we would not do that. We build communities for communities, not for corporations. \n\nUnless something breaks the law, or has DMCA claims that Reddit itself removes, all content within our rules is allowed. \n\nWe are happy that Bethesda has been in our communities and engaged, even Todd Howard said he reads this community, but that doesn't somehow mean they tell us what to do. There has never been a single case of anyone from them EVER reaching out to us here, on Fallout subreddits, or anywhere else to do ANYTHING like that. \n\nWe are people who have been building communites for games longer than Reddit has existed. We have a good understanding of what information is useful or not. \n\n> And now that we know that the devs are directly communicating with the mod team here\n\nSo you went from \"are they\" to \"They 100% are\" and now conspiracy that we are removing things to appease them?\n\nThere a lot better ways to have tried to approach this conversation rather than throwing random accusations to a team that has always been transparent about having zero ties to Bethesda.",

The companions are not instantly your friends you are just forced to work with them because you are now part of said organization and slowly get to know them going on their respective character quests.\n\nUnlike Cyberpunk2077 where Jackie and your relationship is just a cutscene so essentially by the time jackie dies you dont really care for him as you dont spend enough time with him for it to actually matter.\n\nAgain Starfield is not perfect by no means but saying Cyberpunk2077 is better is just factually untrue.

Thats an objective flaw thats not a bug.\n\nAnother example: at the end of CF quest, If you side with the pirates, the Constelattion crew will have an opinion about It, the problem is, the game allow you to take those same people to the final act in that quest, and it might end in, for example, Sarah helping you to take down Sysdef, but this same Sarah will act as she had nothing to do with what just happened.

If your mod is good and otherwise \"sells\" a lot of downloads, creators get paid for their creations with respect to the marketplace (Bethesda Creator Credits, probs spendable money for creators).\n\nI buy Credits.

            "Hahhahahahaahaha Todd give us free premium currency hhaahahahaha that\u2019s cute",
            "There shouldn't be paid mods regardless of how credits are earned. \n\nIf you want to support the mod creator there's plenty of ways to do it that keep Bethesda out if the loop.",
            "i love that idea",
            "Hard pass. I understand where you\u2019re coming from but it\u2019s really not a great idea.",
            "You guys are just begging for Bethesda to turn this into a shitty live service game. What\u2019s next, credit bonuses for logging in daily?",
            "Bethesda isn't going to add an in game way to gain creation points because that would allow the use of console commands and mods that add them.",
            "Yes i totally agree.. or add score quests like fallout 76: kill 1000 ecliptics = 50 credits, explore 100 planets = 50 credits etc",
            "Why not block adding them if you use mods and only allow it on Xbox",
            "Not a completely horrible idea, but it does have a LOT of issues",
            "Damn, I actually think that\u2019s a great idea.  Especially since they want to keep people playing on gamepass.",
            "Great idea but no because money",
            "Nope. The game state is already bad and I don't wanna spend any minute exploring this boring emptyness, especially for \"Creation credits\". Let's hope that normal mods will do the job and'll fix some critical problems.  \nI regret buying Starfield, and I'll think twice before preordering anything from Bethesda,",
            "yeh but they dont care about any of those 4 things",
            "Yes, lazy players can buy them, dedicated players should be able to grind for them",
            "And yes, it would have to be randomized per player!",
            "This is a great idea and making them random is also great",
            "Yeah, this is the big problem. Because Starfield is offline, and we have access to the console, we'd be able to modify our credit balance with the appropriate commands, and at that point, the whole system would fall apart.\n\nEven things like completing dailies wouldn't work because we can force quests to resolve on the spot.\n\nBethesda could give us credits based on achievement completion, but even that system is vulnerable to user manipulation.\n\nSo, ultimately, it's a neat idea, but the game we have could never support it without locking down a lot of functionality we take for granted and being far more like 76 in space.",
            "A single player game shouldn\u2019t require a person to be online all the time to play. Simple.",
            "Creations are an online feature tho, no? Have it be an included feature if you\u2019re playing while you\u2019re online, like messages/notes in souls games, but online isn\u2019t required otherwise",
            "Have the in game equivalent of a qr code.",
            "Not even with mods, you'd be able to do it with console commands. (Though, yeah, mods would work as well.)",
            "There's no way to reasonably authenticate the credits.",
            "Player.additem xxxxxxx 5000\n\nReplace x with the item code for creation credit loot. \n\nSystem broken.",
            "They could do what the recent AC games do with bounties and contracts. You have smaller quests that give a small amount of currency to one huge quest for the week thats  a huge amount.",
            "Yes!!! This is what I was thinking. It would make me explore all of the planets again lol and I have 1000 credits I haven't used yet",
            "Which would kill mods.",
            "I'm with this one.",
            "I\u2019m a little surprised at the sub\u2019s reaction. What OP has described is the business model of like, every MTX driven mobile game. \u201cEarn some in-game currency free by playing\u2026 but VERY LITTLE so people have to buy more to get what they want.\u201d",
            "The funniest thing is they are trying to hock the lowest effort shit for so much money as \"mods\" because no company would ever be able to call them DLC.\n\nOne 2x2 ship module? Thats a mod! Only 10$ too!",
            "Yes that's a great idea to!!",
            "It shows you all of the achievement friendly mods currently.\n\nAnything that modifies the game is going to nullify achievements, and rightfully so. There's no way for them to determine if the modification gives you an edge, so disable achievements and let's all move on",
            "Because without authenticating it via an online server, it would be trivial to hack.",
            "And smart players would cheat them in. I mean... not really smart. A child could work that one out.",
            "I actually think this game would\u2019ve been great as 76 in space, every landing site is an instance, you could enter with your group or by yourself, it would\u2019ve worked great.  I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t go that route, but it probably would\u2019ve been great",
            "> Even things like completing dailies wouldn't work because we can force quests to resolve on the spot.\n\nI mean, they could do something with an easy daily once per day with a very tiny reward, and just shrug and accept that some people are going to cheat it. If you price that into the expected reward (ie. you assume that any player that cares will trivially get it every day, and set the reward accordingly) and are only allowed to collect the reward 1/day no matter what (easily enforced as a server-side requirement without requiring always online) then it doesn't matter if some people are cheating the quest.",
            "Yeah well it\u2019s not that big of a problem when it\u2019s technically already online to download the mods correct? System updates every log someone submits.",
            "Blockchain",
            "I don\u2019t think you read the post thoroughly",
            "It couldn't possibly work though. It just doesn't make any sense. Right now \"creations\" change core mechanics of how the game works. There would immediately be a creation that spits new creation credits out at you, nullifying the entire concept. Or you'd have Starfield 76, which would be absolutely horrible. You could do it on a different game, which a lot of developers do. It's those shitty microtransaction based mobile games that you can download on whatever mobile device you have. Please keep this idea FAR from any developers and distributors. This shit would ruin Starfield. What they should do is not aim for a $10 price point for a custom texture. I've never seen anyone so aggressively advocate to get screwed over",
            "I don't think you understand how cashshops work. To do any of this, Starfield, the SINGLE PLAYER game would have to always be online just so you can get credits for it's stupid cashshop which shouldn't exist in the first place....because it's a single player game...",
            "As MANY others have said, it would mean the game would HAVE TO be always online in order to authenticate the aquiring of the credits, and as such would literally KILL all non visual-only mods outright. Is having mods killed a good trade for you?",
            "There are mods, like the Plushies, that have a literal tag in the description that say achievement friendly.  If the search engine they use can't separate them, what's the point of a search option?  It's not about the achievement friendly mods. It's the point that it doesn't find the tags that contain your search .",
            "If we had an optional co-op multi-player mode, I would 100% play the absolute shit out of that.",
            "so you wouldn\u2019t mind if starfield (a single player game) was only online and needed a constant internet connection?",
            "The problem is how the database works. There's no way to let players generate credits through gameplay that wouldn't be extremely vulnerable to artificial credit generation.",
            "[Vomits blood]\n\n*EDIT: Also, wouldn't work. It'd stop players from minting inauthentic tokens, but wouldn't stop players from instructing the client to mint authentic tokens improperly.*",
            "Why not? It\u2019s doesn\u2019t make it unplayable. It would just mean you can only redeem creation points when online. Otherwise they shouldn\u2019t show up. Idk if that\u2019s possible but in an ideal world. Kind of like how 2k allows vc when connected online in my career. Which is a single player mode but you can play it offline without VC if you choose. It\u2019s all about choice. More choice is good for the player base not less.",
            "This is true. I guess my original comment didn\u2019t elaborate enough. What I mean is, have the choice to play through an online cloud server or keep your game offline. The incentive to stay online would be based on the creation credits. That being said, offline players still being allowed to buy them to get add ons makes sense to. Creates flexibility within the game.",
            "Why not? Because I don\u2019t want to rely on an online service to play my single player game. That\u2019s one of the worst developments of the last decade.",
            "didn't think people who advocate for constantly online single player games existed until now. thought they were like a psyop or some shit.",
            "What I\u2019m saying is\u2026 you don\u2019t HAVE to. Just that people who do get the benefit of creation coins. All while the people who want to keep it offline. Can still buy them to get the coins. I know this community probably isn\u2019t as familiar with the NBA 2K series but it gives you the option for VC. You can play strictly offline without the virtual currency or you can keep it online and earn it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying here. I mean as in an option but not a necessity.",
            "They're real. I kinda suspect they're mostly kids who were raised on shit like Fortnite, and see nothing wrong with companies yanking their games back from them on a whim because they're not old enough to see a game they loved shut down, and have no games in their Steam library over a decade old.",
            "In their defense they aren\u2019t actually advocating for them. They\u2019re just saying they don\u2019t have a problem with them. Small difference, but ya know.",
            "This is more my point. We\u2019re getting closer to the target with this one. What I\u2019m saying is\u2026 if someone wants to keep the game online to earn creation points instead of buying them\u2026 that\u2019s a win in my book against micro transactions. If someone wants to keep it offline and spend hard earned cash on them instead then fine. Do what you want with mommy and daddy\u2019s credit card."

Perfect for your night living and photo opportunities.  \nThe current implementation does not have LOD variations, which is something I plan to look into in the future, so the lights will disappear after a certain distance.  This is a redux of my old Nexus mod with the new Creation Kit, and I was able to make it act with the day/night cycle using GlassCleanOpaque_ExternalEmittance01.mat and Material Swap.  I hope you will like t his mod! Available on Nexus and Creations",
