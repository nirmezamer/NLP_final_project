I tuned all my social media to disallow sensitive content. \n\n\nDespite this, for the last week or so, my Instagram feed (following feed, not explore) is suddenly filled with porn or borderline porn accounts of generalized women. I\u2019ll be scrolling through videos and pictures on my feed of people I follow, then, randomly, it\u2019ll be a video from an account I don\u2019t follow of random women doing  sexual acts uploaded to some generic \u201cexplore\u201d page (always new accounts). Because it isn\u2019t even in the \u201csuggested for you\u201d category, there\u2019s no way for me to use the \u201csee less like this\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d I\u2019m stuck blocking them every time, but it\u2019s up to 5x per day. These aren\u2019t even accounts of just one person/girl, but accounts that post various videos of various women every hour, yet they aren\u2019t filtered as spam and they show up in my feed as though I follow them. When I refresh my page, it just bumps up to the top and doesn\u2019t disappear. \n\n\nI\u2019m not hacked, as I\u2019m not following any of them, but I\u2019m so lost right now. \n\n\nI posted my experience to my story and an old classmate of mine confirmed it was also happening to her and it was similarly bad because it\u2019s so shocking and triggering for her. \n\n\nIs anybody else experiencing this? Has anybody found any solutions? It\u2019s making this app unusable. I want my social media to be safe from porn as much as I can because it is horrifying to me. I\u2019ve used Instagram since it was released and I\u2019ve never experienced this. ",

As excited as I am to be his fianc\u00e9e, I also am sad about the fact that I don\u2019t have any female friends or sisters or close female cousins. I keep feeling embarrassed about how I won\u2019t have friends to FaceTime to tell about my engagement or people to come with me to pick out a wedding dress or bridesmaids. And I know that that isn\u2019t what\u2019s important in the grand scheme of things and what\u2019s important is the marriage, but I still feel sad thinking about the experience I won\u2019t get to have because of my lack of female friends.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in a wedding and would rather elope, but both of our families want to see us get married, and we feel lucky that they want that for us. Still, I feel dread thinking about the day, and how I\u2019ll be reminded at every step of this milestone how few female friends I have. \n\nHas anyone experienced similar feelings? How did you feel? Any advice?",

            "Hey, for the record this is okay. This is normal.  i was in a similar situation to you. What I did was just not have a bridal party and opt for a sweetheart table with my husband and myself, and if people asked, I said I didn\u2019t want to put friends and siblings through the money and hassle of being in a bridal party. I still had female friends, sisters, that kind of thing that attended my wedding and I had fun with, and the fact that we weren\u2019t \u201cclose enough\u201d to do a traditional wedding thing was fine with me. If your husband has lots of male friends who would typically be groomsmen, maybe they can instead do a boys night out type thing and celebrate that way? I\u2019m my experience that kind of thing is less important to men (not to be stereotypical, just saying what I\u2019ve experienced), but of course YMMV\n\nI\u2019ll say that if you\u2019re sad about this, if you want more female friends in your life, you should absolutely take steps to change that. DND helped me make friends, so did going to dog-mom meetups. But if the only thing your sad about is missing out on the tarditional wedding experience, there are lots of alternatives to that that will make your day special and shine a light on you and your partner. \n\n<3 here if you want to talk about it more",
            "This is why I don\u2019t want us to have bridesmaids and groomsmen. If it makes you feel better, 3 out of the 4 weddings I\u2019ve been to this year, only 1 had the traditional amount of bridesmaids and groomsmen, and one had only one maid of honor and 2 best mans, and they were the bride and grooms sister and brother. So I think it\u2019s pretty normal nowadays.",
            "I totally understand that. I have very few female friends, although I\u2019m lucky to have a few female cousins. Do you have close male friends or male cousins? What about aunts? There are no rules that your guy friends or cousins or aunts & uncles can\u2019t come with you to the dress fitting. It may not be traditional or what you truly, deeply want, but maybe it\u2019d still feel nice to have people celebrate finding the dress.",
            "I also don\u2019t have close female friends or any sisters/cousins so I\u2019m having my brother stand up on my side. I will have my brother come with me for dress shopping and my fianc\u00e9 and I are planning to have a joint game night with all of our friends instead of separate bachelor/bachelorette parties. It may not be traditional but you can still have plenty of great experiences. Your wedding can be any way you like as long as you and your partner are happy.",
            "I was in a similar boat to you. Don\u2019t really have friends and not close with my family. I ordered my dress off eBay and my partner had to actually put me in it so he saw it first. 3 of my colleagues surprised me with an afternoon tea as I was moving to my husband\u2019s country and we got married there so I had that in lieu of a hen party. For my wedding, I had my husband, his parents, his sister, her husband and their two kids. My witness was a mutual friend who is a guy and a photographer so he did the pictures too. I\u2019d wanted to elope but felt bad not to have my husband\u2019s family as he lived away for 10 years. \n\nIn the run up, I felt a bit sad that I didn\u2019t get to do all of those stereotypical things like having a sleepover before hand with girls and getting ready with them etc but I just don\u2019t really have friends. In actuality, I\u2019d have hated dress shopping with people because I hate trying on clothes. I was a bridesmaid for my best friend and I hated walking down the aisle with everybody staring at me. \n\nIt was so nice to get ready with my future husband that morning. Everything was really calm and chilled out. We walked down the aisle together and laughed during the ceremony. We had a ceremony in the town hall, had a nice meal and cake then in the evening, we stayed at a hotel and went to a spa. It wasn\u2019t expensive but it was exactly what we wanted. \n\nThe most important thing is doing your wedding how you want it to be with the person you love without feeling like you need to tick boxes to match other people\u2019s weddings.",
            "We had our friends \"pregame\" with us but no actual bridal party. It's actually incredibly expensive to have a bridal/groomsmen party anyways. Maybe that's something you could do? If not, totally consider eloping with family present. It centers the wedding on you as a couple.",

            "Your lack of female friendship is highlighted by the engagement, but you're capable of changing the situation. What do you do to try to make girl friends? I met my best friend through a local suburb meet up group!",
            "1. It's fine not to have any female friends - but what does your support system look like?  You need a support system. Even if it's mom and dad and some male cousins, a brother, etc.  You need people who care about you apart from your boyfriend. They don't have to be women.\n2. If you have a good support system, and you've got someone you love enough to want to marry, then you've got a good thing going. Don't worry about it!\n3. If you don't have a support system, IDK if i'd suggest getting married. Some men seek out women with no support system so they can dominate, control and even abuse them. Especially if your fiance is significantly older than you. \n\nso, in closing: do you need female friends? no. But you do need a support system.  I don't think you should get married unless you have some sort of support system looking out for you specifically.",
            "neither me or my partner have a lot of friends, i have two and my partner doesn\u2019t hang out with anyone, neither does he have family, just his mom. so, if we were to have a wedding, the guests would be 3 people lol. \n\ni get the longing for female friends, but honestly, do you have any male friends you could hang out with? i think that could be equally great! i don\u2019t think following tradition is always the right thing for everyone, since we are all unique. \n\nalso, if you want to elope, DO IT! you don\u2019t owe anyone anything, your wedding is yours only, you should do exactly what you feel like\n\nedit: btw i freaking love everything about weddings/engagements so if you need someone to be excited with my DMs are open!!!"

My mother is like 50 I think.\n\n So essentially, I'm going to learn how to swim this summer. I want to wear a bikini or like a two piece because it'll be different for me and whatnot (never have been in a swimsuit before). It'll be cute and I'm getting older, so it won't be like bad or anything. I asked my mom if I could get one and she said no. It has to be a one piece. Now, I have nothing against one pieces, I just know that the reason she has for me being forced to wear one is fairly stupid. \n\nShe says that me learning how to swim in a bikini is inappropriate and that's something that you wear when you already have learned. She also says that I'll be around little kids (the class is like 6-17 year olds) and I'll be exposed to them. That I'm so desperate to just show myself to the world. that and creeps or whatever. But like, who cares if some creep is looking at me? chances are he'd be looking at me if I were in a one piece as well, right? Nothing bad is going to happen in a public pool during swim lessons lmao so the creep paranoia is insane. It also wouldn't be a problem if he were just looking anyway, so long as he doesn't pull anything weird so like we're good! I have to \"graduate\" to a bikini, graduation meaning that I learn how to swim so it's appropriate.\n\nMy question is, are these genuine concerns that come with wearing a bikini? Am I being too lax with everything and just not seeing her point due to me being stubborn? (would appreciate if older girls would also put in some insight since my mom is like old lol). If so, can someone explain how to prevent any issues that happen due to bikini wearing? Thank you!",

            "Just make sure you have one that\u2019s meant for swimming and not just lounging. Learned that the hard way when I pushed off the wall and my top flipped itself inside out :<",
            "Hi, current swim teacher/coach here. \n\nI'd really recommend against anything like a triangle/string/tube top bikini. As some other people have said, most of those bikinis aren't made for actual swimming. It would be really awful for your top to come down while you are learning how to float or push off the wall with some force. \n\nAnother note is that often, your swim coach will need to make some type of correction. I usually do this with a tap on the body part that needs to move because your ears are usually underwater and talking is not always an option. Sometimes too if the student falls, I will need to catch them and help them back on their feet. I try my best not to hold on for very long, but for a person in a bikini if I'm holding on to your waist picking you up that could make you uncomfortable. \n\nNot all two pieces are created equal and you absolutely can wear a two-piece! Most of my older teenagers and adults do. But I would recommend something similar to a tankini or at the very least a long line bikini. \n\nAnd this is a side note from me to you. Swimming is a very important skill to have and I love that you are going to be learning it. But, please focus your energy on learning it and learning it well as opposed to looking good while learning it. There will be so many other times in your life that you can put your energy into looking cute, but I would not recommend some lessons for that time.",
            "Ok, first of all this \n\n>That I'm so desperate to just show myself to the world. that and creeps or whatever\n\nIs a disgusting thing to say to anyone, let alone your own child. \n\nBut this\n\n>She also says that I'll be around little kids (the class is like 6-17 year olds) and I'll be exposed to them.\n\nMade me wonder whether she's really poorly explaining a genuine issue, which is that most bikinis are designed more for sunbathing by the pool and casual, low energy swimming than dedicated physical activity. You should absolutely get a two piece if that's what you want, just make sure the top half is supportive and going to keep everything in place. Think sports bra vs normal bra - some swimwear will look cute but be annoying when you're actually trying to exercise.",
            "Are you learning in a swimming pool, or the ocean? My 18yr old daughter took up surfing, and she will tell anyone, depending where you are that at times a bikini isn\u2019t the best choice unless it is specifically designed as an athletic fit and style. \n\nA lot of bikini\u2019s can easily come off in physical activity. So maybe look for a sport bikini that has a bit more support, and coverage so you don\u2019t have to worry about the girls popping out.",
            "Most bikinis are not super practical to learn in if you're jumping and moving around a lot. Not because of how you would look but because a lot are designed for just kinda lounging. If you have a sportier style one that is designed to stay in place well I don't think there's anything wrong with that",
            "Honestly, the last thing you want to be focusing on in a swim lesson is trying to keep your bikini in place. Wardrobe malfunctions are pretty common. Get two suits - a one piece for swim lessons and a bikini for other occasions.",
            "I grew up in the pool and teaching other people to swim.  Your mom is phrasing things badly, but she does have a practical point underneath the judgement.  You don\u2019t want to have to manage your bathing suit while you\u2019re learning to swim, because it\u2019s a distraction for YOU, not for anyone else.  If you\u2019re thinking about a random boob popping out, you can\u2019t really focus on the lessons, so if you\u2019re going for a two piece, make sure it\u2019s sporty and not fashiony.  Think more sports bra top and less triangle bikini, and you should be absolutely secure enough to not have to think about it while you\u2019re swimming.",
            "There will be plenty of time to wear whatever you want once you've learned to swim. But until that time, just get a practical swimsuit just to be sure.\u00a0",

            "I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re located but the only thing I\u2019d caution with a bikini is the lack of sun protection if the pool is outdoors. Obviously you can still get sunburnt in a one piece but it does cover up a bit more. \n\nEither way, if it\u2019s an outdoor pool just make sure you put on sunscreen.",
            "It's not inappropriate. But as others have said choose carefully. So many of us have learned the hard way that when swimming the water will flow into your bikini pulling it away from your body. Now I'm always paranoid when swimming in a bikini about whether people looking at me are getting a free nip show. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI hope you enjoy learning to swim.",
            "Your mother is full of shit. You can learn to swim wearing whatever you want and especially kids *really* won't care. And yes creeps will look regardless. Creeps will be creeps.\n\nShe likely has other motives for saying that and will find other excuses to deny you a bikini even if you learned to swim in record time.",
            "You might want to check with the place providing the lessons. A lot of places will have a list of required items to bring to the class and they might have restrictions as well on what you wear.",

            "No it's not inappropriate. It's very strange to me that you're 16 and your parents haven't helped you learn to swim or ever wear a swimsuit. My daughter is 2 and she wears two pieces all the time because it's practical for potty training.",
            "I do get that, really the thing that set me off is just that she makes it seem like I'm going skinny dipping (hell no). like I'm not walking in with a micro bikini or something. I don't think kids would would really care, or maybe swimming kids are just something else lmao. I was thinking just a normal bikini, one that the top is like a sports bra and the bottom is just like panties",
            "Yeah like, I was thinking just the normal ones you see in the store. The top looks like a sports bra and the bottom is like panties or something. Idk like my whole family is against a lot when it comes to me showing more skin so there is also motive in that for me.",
            "This. Most bikinis you would see around stores are for sun bathing and going in and out of the water, not physical activity. If you want to actually swim go for a one piece speedo and then change into the bikini after for lounging. I do only have one bikini that works for swimming and it\u2019s basically a sports bra type that could have been a one piece for how boring but functional it is except it\u2019s easier to change with two pieces.",
            "it's in a pool, I was just thinking of like a normal two piece. like the top looks like a bra and the bottom looks like panties if that makes sense",

It\u2019s worth getting checked out by your doctor to make sure there\u2019s no reason why this has happened but I wouldn\u2019t be overly concerned. The pain is likely because a piece that big will have to stretch your cervix to exit, plus your uterus will have to contract harder than usual to expel it.",
            "Thanks so much! Here is a photo of it. I think it looks like a decidual cast. Is a decidual cast something I need to see a doctor for? I appreciate your help! I\u2019ve been so worried\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxkrhgog38d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a859429784a44db2e9652f1fd5b8a349c1b4eadf",
            "Thanks so much. I do have a partner, so I guess there is a chance I could be pregnant but I was on birth control so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. I will speak to my doctor. Thanks so much!",
            "Thank you so much! Is it normal to feel a bit lightheaded?",
            "Mine looked similar! I\u2019m not a doctor and I would always recommend getting medical advice from your doctor but nothing happened with mine and it hasn\u2019t happened for a few years! And I\u2019ve had no other issues since :) \n\nIf there\u2019s any chance you could be pregnant, or you haven\u2019t had any major changes with your birth control recently then I would definitely advise contacting your doctor.",
            "How have you not ran to the ER \ud83e\udee3 that\u2019s scary af!\n\nPlease do still talk to your doctor about this and wether or not something can be done to avoid this in the future. I\u2019ve had clumps and big ones too but never the entire lining out in one go",
            "Not generally but that could be a bit of a shock reaction since it really is quite startling and worrying when you first see it.",
            "Thanks so much! I was taking birth control the past month so I don\u2019t think that I am pregnant, but maybe I can do a pregnancy test just to make sure and then contact my doctor if needed.",
            "Birth control definitely triggered mine I think! It was so scary when it happened, I thought an organ had fallen out haha hopefully you don\u2019t get another one, they\u2019re supposed to be quite rare thankfully :)",
            "Thanks so much for sharing this with me. I totally relate, it\u2019s been very painful and traumatic. I appreciate you. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to us again."

I also noticed that older guys are often very agressive when they ask me out and almost always come across in a very sexual and objectifying way.\nThey also tend to be very entitled. \n\nI had older men approach me and immediately give or offer money. It\u2019s always about how they\u2019ll make my life better assuming I don\u2019t already like my life or that my life isn\u2019t better.\n\nI want to keep this PG but some of the most disgusting sexual things were told to me by old men completely unprovoked assuming I would be impressed ugh.\n\nOverall, I get very depressed when older men ask me out. I am creeped out by someone almost my dad\u2019s age wanting to date me but then after the whole ordeal I am almost always left feeling devalued, and objectified. \n",

            "I\u2019m not often proposed to by older men since I look way older than I am. I was more often approached by older men when I was 13-18 \n\nThe fact that my pretty 15 year old sister is approached by man that tend to be up to the age of 35 is creeping me out. \n\nMy family looks quite mature but honestly this is so uncomfortable.",
            "yes, I do. I've never had experiences as aggressive as yours (they just kind of look at me like a piece of meat or try to talk to me like I'm fucking stupid because they don't want me to leave) but yeah, I have a small jdea of the level of upset you feel. \n\nHow do they get the opportunity to ask you out? like, do they just walk up to you or? from there, you can think about how to prevent that. e.g. if they tend to walk up to you, you stay alert and move away in public. if it's in a peer group or something, then try your best not to get too close to older men. etc etc\n\nyou could say loudly and calmly, \"no, I do not wish to [repeat disgusting sexual thing he has propositioned you with] and I would like you to leave me alone.\"\n\nnothing is foolproof, but at least being able to do something might make you feel less horrible. it's terrifying.",

            "I'm sorry this hasn't changed. I'm in my 50s and when I was my twenties 50-year-old men would ask me out. So gross so gross they would get angry when I would say no. Now that I'm middle-aged it doesn't happen anymore. I don't mind so much. \n\nIyou could tell him no thanks I don't have daddy issues.",
            "I had a big problem with this when I started at the gym when I was 16. It bothered me to no end and luckily the gym staff handled it appropriately.\n\nI hate to say it but now that I am 24, I get bothered way less by them. I think I\u2019m too old for them now (yuck) or I finally figured out how to embrace the RBF don\u2019t approach me face. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s both but mostly that I\u2019m older now and older men are gross because they see you as an easy target. \n\nNow I just wish guys my age would approach me haha!",
            "Teenagers dad here. You have no reasons to feel undervalued. These guys are fishing for girls with issues You don't have (as in, girls that are INTO this s\\*\\*t, yes, they exist, other peoples sexuality rarely makes sense to us). They don't care how You may feel because, if your reaction is negative, You are not into them anyway so they have nothing to lose. Neither to you.\n\nBe proud and happy You are not one of girls they are looking for, that Your sexuality is not determined by this kind of kink (it's not exactly fair to girls that live with that but, we are talking about why You should be proud of yourself) - their lives are more complicated and conflicted than Yours, by average. Nobody has a perfect life, but this is one complication you are free of.\n\nFinally, learn to talk back. These guys do go after polite / scared girls - don't ask me how they recognize them, they do. Practice thinking about something You are angry about but not afraid of (idiots on internet, younger sister stealing your cosmetics, sh\\*t on your boots you walked into and now have to clean up, whatever), and use it to trigger genuine anger when You need it and tell them to F\\*\\*k. Off. You are a margin of error, a waste of time, to them. They are a waste of time, a manure on boots, to you.",
            "Yes they usually just walk up to me. Once, one even followed me inside a store while I was shopping. I\u2019m going to try your advice with moving away and especially saying no loudly like you said. Thank you.",
            "Yes, they get upset when you say no! It\u2019s so weird and shocking. It\u2019s shameful."
