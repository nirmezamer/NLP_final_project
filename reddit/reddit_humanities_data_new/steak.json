Believe me im agreeing with you here. I think that\u2019s a sentiment a lot of lifters hold actually. I\u2019m pretty sure like a majority of the ifbb pros do the bro split that it was coined the \u201cpro split\u201d. Even tho ppl is better according to data.",
            "I hear you. The bro split is probably the most enjoyable split. And whatever split keeps you engaged and consistent is honestly the best split for you. I've been reading and seeing lately that the best split is probably no split at all. Full body, five or six times per week. Full body, but not necessarily whole body. Whatever's recovered is what you train. Allows you to hit smaller muscle groups that recover faster almost daily. Larger groups that take a lot longer to recover get trained with far less frequency. While that may very well be the best way to train, I just can't see myself doing it. So, for me, it wouldn't be ideal at all."

When you skimp on a piece of meat from the store its still semi ok... when they skimp it goes from prime rib to multi meat hotdogs real quick... i still to this day cannot believe the sad quality of food service foods comparatively speaking to what you can buy in the store even at the cheapest price...

            "My girlfriend and I sometimes go for lunch because of their $5 margaritas that are pretty loaded.  We eat the relatively basic stuff like apps or burgers, decent enough.  I wouldn't dare attempt a steak.\n\nThe restaurant is at an extremely busy suburban intersection on Long island.  It is entirely empty every time we go.",

            "I do understand where you are coming from, BUT have you been in the past year? They have totally revamped their menu and the new executives are really trying to make it decent again. It\u2019s not absolutely terrible now.",

            "I can\u2019t really complain about Texas Roadhouse tbh. They always give me exactly what I ordered, the exact way I wanted it cooked. It always tastes good, and it doesn\u2019t cost $40 for a steak.\n\nThey\u2019re not perfect, but I\u2019ve never felt ripped off or had a bad experience. Pretty fair food for the price, dunno why it gets all the hate here.",
            "Last one I went to was acceptable for sure, about the most 5-6 out of 10 experience I could ask for.",
            "When I was younger I worked at an Applebee's. The problem with their steaks is that they come frozen in vacuum sealed bags. You have to thaw them and then cut an opening and let them \"bloom\" for a day. That way the color comes back. If you got super busy and ran out of steaks and they didn't have time to let the color come back, you could cook them to a perfect internal temperature but would not be red or pink. These would be sent back and there is nothing you could do. Fortunately, most people that decided they wanted a steak at a fucking Applebee's ordered them Medium well or well done so the color wasn't an issue lol",
            "Did you think a steak was already on the grill waiting for you to ask for a replacement? I\u2019m baffled at how anyone could even think to order a steak at a cheap chain restaurant. Go to Texas Roadhouse or Longhorns and order whatever steak you like. You get what you deserve ordering a steak at Applebees.\u00a0",

            "Yep.  They usually have pretty good ribeyes and if you like mac and cheese as a side, outbacks is pretty great.",
            "it\u2019s all just small towns where i stay and while we do have a good handful of local food options sometimes ill go out of my way to get that one specific thing from Applebees. its good, simple as that.",

This kinda the reason why red lobster is going under. The people that bought it sold the property under the restaurants, so the chain no longer has the real estate value that it once had. McDonald\u2019s is a real estate company first and hamburger place second.",

            "They\u2019re not good but that\u2019s all I would get from there if I went. It\u2019s kind of like how dominoes isn\u2019t good pizza but sometimes it hits the spot. Also depends on if it\u2019s boneless or bone in, feel like the boneless are a higher chance of being bad",
