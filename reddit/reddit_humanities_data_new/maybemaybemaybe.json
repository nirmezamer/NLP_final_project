            "A lot of times art isn't just about the final product but puts importance on the process. Whether the process is supposed to be unique, a statement, or entertainment. In this case she is most likely doing this for the entertainment aspect.",
            "Too practical",
            "Yes but the point of modern art is to do things in the most convoluted way you can think of",
            "There are no mistakes. Just happy little accidents",
            "I agree that the previous background was more tasteful. If she is truly the artist of this painting, I'd dare to say this video is rage bait. Talent doesn't make up for vision, I suppose.",
            "It looked like pillars or columns behind her before, like she was in some roman architecture. Now it looks like the landfill is behind her",
            "Why are you offended by their offense?",
            "Not offended just not impressed.",
            "no one\u2019s offended, we just think its dumb",
            "New flash alert you don't have to be an owner of art to criticize it. Even more so if you wanna go that route. I'm sure some people own video games, which by some are art. It's really subjective, but the first two scrapes looked good. If people don't like it no big deal.",
            "Hard agree. Still a good painting but looked best on first smear",
            "I agree, some noise makes it much more compelling than too much noise. She's slightly off from her surroundings or vice versa as opposed to \"blurry bokeh meh\" completely removed from the setting.",
            "have you seen the full video?",
            "I think the art is actually the Reddit comment about the video of the painting, finding meaning in people getting confused.",
            "Shakespeare bs meanings?",
            "Yeah, there were clearly pillars and steps behind her, with a decent quality of shading/lighting to indicate a sunny day. When I take a breath, the end product isn't bad, and it still conveys a message, but it felt unnecessary. Or more, it could have been a second piece based on the first instead of destroying one to make the other.",
            "I mean I do genuinely understand why people say that but both of these fall under the category of \u201cmodern art.\u201d Nothing about the core emotion of the painting changed, it just shifted from one background to another and people are ragging on it.\n\nI bet if she were to take the second painting and scrape it downward to make painting one people would still be screeching about her \u201cruining it.\u201d None of these people whining actually have an opinion about the piece, they just wanna hate cuz they think it\u2019s cool.",
            "It is. I liked it better before any of the wiping.",
            "Lol Leonardo Da Vinci did convoluted, too. It's not new.",
            "It's not a mistake, it was a purposely done Downgrade to see anyone who \"finds it better\", and call them stupid",
            "She looks out of place, the sense of the context given previously by the scenery was deconstructed.. And for what???",
            "She feel detached from the background for some reason imo",
            "In English class they keep telling you every scene or line has a deeper meaning like 4 layers in. \n\nI think Romeo was just going through puberty and was acting like a normal dumb young idiot. It's not always so deep.",
            "It's her own fucking art, she's not destroying ANYTHING. Holy shit how wrong are all of these replies.",
            "To be fair, this is the type of art that sells at Pier 1 Imports or Kohl's so she knows her market.\n\n2 wipes madam ! Two ! Tops",
            "So you're saying it was a mistake to do it?",
            "Like I think everyone else is saying. Either she's a terrible artist, which I guess is subjective. Or it's rage bait. The art might be the video itself pissing everyone off. Art makes you.. feel, right? Well I'm feeling pretty pissed she did what she did. So maybe mission accomplished. I don't fucking know. Art is weird man",
            "thats the whole point(?",
            "The point of that is to get you to think and argue analytically. Your English teacher wasn\u2019t just there to have you read for leisure, lol. But I think they\u2019d be happy you\u2019re still thinking about Shakespeare in any capacity.",
            "Shakespear was a guy. Guys don\u2019t think that deep. A red rose, is a flower of type rose with color red. \n\nIt has nothing to do with a warm feeling (red) for beautiful (rose) things in live, which are about to die.\n\nAdding layers is adding BS",

            "There definitely is value in analyzing and learning about life and human relationships through works of art. It should however be based on what the source material reveals by itself and it shouldn\u2019t be treated as a riddle book, where everything has an obscure symbolic meaning and everyone pats themselves on the back for finding it afterwards. Sometimes the surface level IS the deeper meaning.",
            "Man. It's 10 30 and I'm drinking lmao I can't go into this now \ud83d\ude02 I'll just say that I think words and specifically which words someone chooses to use hold much more meaning to what they honestly mean, then what they think they are portraying. \n\nIts vague and I can't really deep dive into it, just what I took from English was that words and their meanings hold a lot of value for the whole story. Some words have similar meanings but...it can change the whole meaning of a sentence, of a story. \n\nI have a bottle of rum to go back to though so idk if I'm making sense lmao sorry",
            "A good literature teacher will explain the explicit meaning behind something if there is one, or open the room for discussion if it is ambiguous. Some stuff has a meaning for its time that makes the symbolic meaning different than we would think of it now. \n\nFor example, in Hamlet the appearance of his father's ghost is actually a reference to the beliefs at the time that ghost would appear if there was disruption in the natural order of society (which there was due to what happened with the throne). Learnt that from my literature teacher haha. But I bet some people have tried to analyze it as if there was something open to interpretation!",
            "Enjoy! I really liked what you shared and totally get what you mean (I think). Cheers!",

            "Exactly! And that\u2019s a lot better than regurgitating the same empty interpretation of the green light in The Great Gatsby.",
            "I sort of just nitpick on the small things people choose to say. Like \"why did they say betray?  Not disappoint, not upset, not misunderstanding...not this or that\" or w.e and just over think things\n\nIn English class (yes I've pivoted to talking about this and being terrible irl with who I'm drinking with) I feel like the weight of the words is just more powerful than people tend to believe.\n\n I didnt care if Romeo and Juliet wanted to end their family feud through love and the death was tragic because it showed how it couldn't be. They're teenagers. It's much more relatable if they're idiots"
