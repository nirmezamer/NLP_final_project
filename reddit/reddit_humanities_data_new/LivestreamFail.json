            "The fact that Twitch reported one of their biggest profit generators to NCMEC tells you one thing, if Slasher's claim is true, the whispers must have been pretty damn bad.",
            "Can somebody explain the severity of that to somebody not from the US? What would put that above just reporting to the local police etc\u2026?",
            "As much as I want Twitch to release the chat logs maybe it's better that they don't.",
            "Why is Slasher slowly saying more and more information? Out with it my dude.",
            "Keeps getting worse and worse, this whole thing is insane, especially the defense of this guy despite his story changing and getting worse and worse, it can\u2019t be overstated how truly disgusting the amount of defense for this guy that\u2019s going on. Twitch doesn\u2019t just ban people for no reason, there\u2019s been people who have shown nudity on stream, had sex on stream and only got a few day ban, twitch does not permaban people often especially not the face of their platform while they had a contract worth millions that would have been very lucrative for both parties. By his own admission he inappropriately messaged a minor and he has never said he didn\u2019t know they were a minor which would obviously be his best defense and if that was the case he\u2019d be saying it over and over again. No matter how you want to spin it, messaging a minor inappropriately is objectively wrong, trying to defend this person or rationalize it or downplay it simply because you like watching them play video games is just pure insanity. Can we not all agree inappropriately messaging a minor is bad? Are we all so divided that we can\u2019t even agree on that???",
            "About Us section of NCMEC: \n\n\"The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\u00a0is a\u00a0private,\u00a0non-profit\u00a0501(c)(3) corporation whose mission is to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation, and prevent child victimization. NCMEC works with families, victims, private industry, law enforcement, and the public to assist with preventing child abductions, recovering missing children, and providing services to deter and combat child sexual exploitation.\"",
            "How come everyone turns a blind eye to Nmplol grooming his gf when she was 16? Isn't that as bad, if not worse than this?",
            "How long did Slasher know about the NCMEC report?",
            "Can\u2019t wait to see asmongold defend this.",
            "They are forced to report anything that is considered suspicious doesn't mean a thing. So many cases gets reported each day most ends up being a nothing burger. If Twitch had enough \"proof\" they wouldn't have settled. \n\nEspecially if no pictures involved or detailed meetup were discussed it's hard to get someone convicted. The only thing Doc has to worry about is his image, not the police."

            "Not blaming Slasher at all but he himself said he was trying to sell the story to an outlet that would back him but what changed recently? Did Bloomberg decide from a vague twitter thread to back Slasher story? Or did Slasher not have primary knowledge until recently.",
            "True aaaaaaaaaaaand... Yeah, that's pretty true. That's true and- yeah that's true. That's true. That's true- That's pretty true. That's pretty true, I mean- inhales ... That's true. Yeah. That's true. Uhm- That's true. That's fuckin' true. Uhm... That's how it is dude.",
            "Of course he wouldn't publish it without evidence, he would get sued. The dumbass thing he did was say that he knew the reason 4 years ago to bait everyone",
            "Funny how he's criticizing slasher for this right now but had a journalist who also had all this info from multiple sources weeks ago and had no issue with it. Even had private discussions with the dude before and after the stream about what doc did",
            "Unless Slasher had proof, that wouldn't require a lawsuit from DrDisrespect so Slasher could find it in discovery, then it was correct for him not to publish anything.\n\nIf the minor went to Slasher with the story though, that'd be a different story.",
            "Just get sued and win bro ezpz and not stressful or expensive.",
            "I feel like people here don't understand how powerful of an agency CAA really is. I'm going to go out on a limb and say they have buried shit worse than this. If you come after one of their clients. You better damn well be sure of what you're getting into.",
            "People here don\u2019t understand how journalism works lol",
            "Slasher himself said he had multiple SECOND hand sources. Not FIRST hand sources.\n\nIf he broke a story with second hand sources his ass is getting a defamation lawsuit."

If he steps away for a few months or maybe even a year and starts doing content then he'll still have a massive audience. He can even cook up some fake apology and say that he's reflected on his mistakes and he's now a better man. He may also show his new dog or a new cool magic trick he learned. If people like zherka can have a platform then anyone can have a platform.",
            "Yeah hes done pretty much streaming wise. No fucking sane sponsor will take him under wings, after shit like that and the majority of viewers probably reconsider watching a cheating pedo I guess."
