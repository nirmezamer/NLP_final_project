Twitched likely blundered and illegally terminated the contract in an abortive attempt seperate them from the Dr. Maybe they thought it was only a matter of time till it got out or the victim came forward. However, based on the info we know, it's unlikely the contract had a morality clause wide enough for this (especially if the victim decided to not come forward). This is probably why the Dr. was so confident in his case\n2. It would have then been in both Dr and Twitch best interests to settle. Twitch gets to put it to bed - gets to limit damages to the contact most likely, and the Dr. gets this under NDA. Till now. trial could backfire for both and air lots of dirty laundry.\n\nIf I guess the reason this whole shit became so quiet is the victim decided to not come forward.",

Based on the fact that they settled and that Twitch likely hasn't said anything out of fear of a defamation lawsuit, I wonder if this leak will open up new litigation.

If the minor reported the messages from Doc, it would have certainly been taken to the authorities.

So they all agree to a big NDA and settle the contract situation in which both parties are in the wrong.\n\nEdit: Alternatively twitch may have just wanted to keep it under wraps because it would be a bad look for the platform if one of their headline streamers was grooming a minor.

If ofc it turns out to be true.\n\nIf it were me and someone said this and it wasn't true, I'd be furious because this is the type of shit that can end people's lives. Even if it isn't true and you don't acknowledge it, once those rumours are out there, there will always be a dedicated group pushing that narrative, which is why you need to get on top of that shit fast.\n\nThen again, I'm saying this as a normie, we all know celebrities and influencers get some type of special treatment and no matter how insane shit is, nothing ever ends up going further than Twitter/X he said, she said, it's all just internet drama this and how many clicks/views can I get.",

It was likely a necessary condition for the agreement even to be reached in the first place. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the allegations were true, but that Dr. Disrespect\u2019s words and actions were ambiguous enough  to avoid criminal liability, and were enough to make Twitch skittish about being affiliated wit Disrespect and having him on-premises at their events where he would be interacting with fans that were underage, especially once they were made aware of his communications \u2014 it\u2019d look really bad if Twitch knew Dr. Disrespect was engaging on predatory behavior using their platform, but was having him meet fans. \n\nIf Disrespect did manage to creep up to the line of criminal culpability without crossing the threshold then I can see why Twitch thought it best to just move on. Litigation is time-consuming, expensive and opens up a lot of vulnerabilities to both parties. Disrespect\u2019s lawyers would, in the course of the discovery phase, undoubtedly request all sorts of information on how the platform operates, how it stores private messages/whispers, etc. \n\nTwitch wanted to just move on from Dr. Disrespect and thought that, all things considered, the most prudent course of action was to settle.",

I fully expect Twitch to be completely ridicules in everything they do. If this guy is gonna leak inside information, he needs to show these texts when he's publically slandering people. Right now, there is a lot of people memeing about Disrespect being a pedo, which is pretty fucked up and I assume this guy is viable to get sued.",

When it comes to messaging, I believe you can.\n\nSo legally speaking, they just have a streamer who morally wrong because he's got a wife (he already admitted on stream that he cheated on his wife once so theres a history of that behavior) but they got nothing because it was unknown to Doc that she was a minor and the persons parents probably found the messages and went to Twitch.\n\nThis is just my assessment because this is the only reason I could think as to why there has been no criminal action against Doc and Twitch basically being quiet about this on top of paying out his contract with the adage \"no wrongdoing was acknowledged.\"",

So they're stuck with this weird situation where they technically violated the contract, which would mean Doc could sue the shit out of them for probably tens of millions or even more because he could argue it's ruined his future opportunities and money growth, but the problem on Doc's end is that everyone will think he's a pedo if anything gets out about the situation, especially if the case is public, so doc settles for just having the rest of his contract paid out and they both shake hands and move on.\n\nTLDR: Twitch probably violated his contract by banning him without any real proof but Doc doesn't want to be known as a pedo so they compromise by paying out his contract.",

I'd wager that's absolutely what they did.\n\nAssuming it's true, I'd wager it went something like this:\n\n*Twitch receives message from victim making accusation, who then provides evidence with dates and times of the conversation*\n\n*Twitch investigates by looking at the actual messages stored on their servers and confirms the accusations are true.*\n\n*Employee involved pushes it up the chain who discusses it with their legal department, relevant (and irrelevant) management. Decision is made to treat Dr Disrespect as they would any user found violating the TOS in such egregious manner.*\n\n*Twitch slams the banhammer and provides logs to relevant law enforcement.*\n\n*Law enforcement investigates. Guy Beahm's lawyers ensure he doesn't speak to the police and the police cannot prove the case, so no charges are ever filed.* I could think of a dozen defenses that would easily break a case built solely on an accusation and chat logs. Showing that multiple people had access to the account would be enough. Like, perhaps, an angry vindictive wife angry over a case of infidelity. Remember kids, it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. \n\n*Guy initiates lawsuit against Twitch. Twitch decides that paying out the contract, cutting ties and keeping the ban in place, along with an ironclad NDA is in their best interest.*",

You were right and said/ guessed what majority of the community reflected, thats not even what sent critizm his way.. which rather was the claims of him being **informed and knew** what happened. \n\nTLDR: If the goal was to prove he didn't lie, then he would've/ should've articulated the \"I was told by XXX and know something everyone wants to know\" part instead.",

However, the majority of my experience is limited to Australia and our legal system, and I am not familiar with what would be the norm in the US.\n\nAs to the evidence, the former employee who posted on Twitter that started all this might not have a copy of the DMs. It is also not his information and would belong to twitch. He also didn't specifically name the Doc, presumably to distance himself somewhat and give him some for of plausible deniability if Doc was to consider a civil claim against him.\n\nAt the moment, the evidence is the former employee's tweet, slashers tweet, and the comments made by Dan(?) to Destiny and Richard Lewis. The Docs response on Twitter and the wording used does not categorically deny the accusations: \"no wrongdoing was acknowledged\"\n\n> Twitch could care less about Doc\n\nIt's important to realize the accusations aren't being made by Twitch, rather a former employee. If I were to hazard a guess why he decided to post this accusations, he may have thought it morally wrong for Twitch to sweep this under the rug to protect their public image, and wanted some form of repercussions against Doc for what he (allegedly) did, even if that's just being dragged through the court of public opinion.",

Doc is also a public figure, which means that there needs to be proof of actual malice, which I can't really find in the original tweet. Someone who has had access to the real reasoning (and proof) behind the ban would not need to worry, as they are able to avoid the \"false statement of fact\" section of the law, invalidating the claim. All that Cody would need to do if he got sued is have his lawyers subpoena twitch and prove that what he is saying is true (assuming it is), and the case is over. If Slasher did not have access to direct proof and those sources he used were not willing to go on record and drag twitch into it, there could be an argument for negligence (as he would have been making claims on what amounts to hearsay).  \n\nSlasher _could_ have published it and hoped really hard to afford the lawsuit and that a subpoena would reveal that his sources were correct... but going against CAA lawyers, I probably wouldn't have risked it either.

You\u2019re looking at thousands upon thousands of dollars. How much do you think Slasher makes?\n\nAnd all of this for what? What does Slasher get if he wins the case? Congrats you didn\u2019t lie.

At this point, the case has been going on for IIRC, over a year at this point (definitely more than 6 months), and has cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. In Australia where Karl is, he can recoup a lot of the lawyer's fees if he wins, but that isn't usually the case in the US. \n\nSo even if Slasher goes to court and wins, he could still end up being out tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. And even if Slasher does win, he doesn't actually get anything for it. All he gets is to say \"I told you so\" which while fun, isn't worth tens of thousands of dollars.",

I doubt Dexerto does. Would CNN cover this? Would ESPN? This was also when COVID was starting to pop off.\n\nEither way people for sure knew the reason behind the scenes and no journalist did what you recommended. I\u2019m going to assume they aren\u2019t morons and were actually worried about their careers.\n\nTo turn the tables. For your theory to be correct\n\n1) almost no one knew behind the scenes why Doc got banned which is contradicted cause Destiny says he has known this story for years and he isn\u2019t a journalist.\n\nOr\n\n2) journalists knew but none of them pushed it. None of them went to media companies and asked them to publish or if they did they got turned down. Why would that be?\n\nAlso Doc kinda confirmed this theory in his prior Twitter post.",

If you were a male celebrity, got fired suddenly and the news caught on why, and noone knew, isn't that the top theory?\n\n\nThats why these idiot trolls like Destiny claiming they heard it somewhere like it's credible. Yeah you heard it on Discord, Twitch, or Rust? Right, cause everyone's worried about defamation to not spread some rumor about Doc.",
            "They released it in 2022. Broad strokes is most things outside of calendar, contacts and mail are end to end encrypted when a user enables this setting.",
            "i mean the postman could open your mail and read it before delivering it. it would still be a scandal.",
            "Good lesson for them. No one likes a pedantic Peter, especially given the situation",
            "Yes, why not if you can afford it",
            "Hmm. Maybe with this thing called the internet. It logs everything you do. It\u2019s almost as if there would be digital evidence if it happened and went to court! But that would require a brain to understand",
            "He\u2019s already loaded enough to send good great great great great great grandkids to college so he probably won\u2019t do anything too drastic",
            "Cause we know private businesses are always on the up and up.",
            "This situation seems like the victim did not want to be identified or deal with life altering legal drama. It explains so much if you assume that much. And I get it. You see how often nothing happens to these pervs while the victim just gets dragged the whole time.",
            "He probably didn't commit a crime at all. He texted a minor weird things and they banned him so that they didn't have to deal with his future bad PR.",
            "Twitch would want this to go to court. \u00a0If you think them saying they caught one of their biggest streamers trying to meet up with a underage girl and terminated him and reported him to the police is somehow going to make them look bad\u2026I have news for you.\u00a0\n\nThis makes them look worse. The media can now say that Twitch covers up their top stars grooming children and meeting up with them at their own major events for sexual contact.\u00a0\n\nIt would be in Twitch\u2019s best interest to have taken this fully to court and get the fact that he is/was sexting minors on the record for the world to see. \u00a0That would end him forever in the streaming landscape.\u00a0",
            "And in the case this ever become public, twitch would risk getting a cease and desist, by covering up traffic of minors, as they would appear as a platform that allows for this to happen, it happened, and they covered it up instead of reporting it to police. Twitch would cease to exist.\n\nWhy would twitch do that? Let's be real....",
            "I mean if it's true this getting out would also make Twitch look unsafe for kids. When your biggest viewer group is underage kids you probably don't want it getting out that pedos could use your platform to target kids.",
            "Shades of \u201coh, well OJ got off.\u201d\n\nJust stop.",
            "Legally \u2260 Factually",
            "Yeah you probably forgot a lot things to justify watching him.",
            "heck yeah dude i hate gay people too xD",
            "> Yeah well being creepy with a minor isn't the same as sexting a minor \n\nThat's not really a line a sane person who isn't a lawyer or something would bother debating.",
            "Maybe if the person completely disappears, not changes platforms.\n\nThe by far the most normal explanation was a disagreement over the contract or some other financial dispute, if anybody's, assuming no insider information, first thought was \"omg kiddy diddler\", they need to take a break.",
            "Because the biggest impact it would have is generating \"Person accused of sexting minors\" headlines",
            "Your twitch account confirms your identity, age and occupation? Twitch is not some government investigation agency, what they have is only their own logs. So they had victim approaching them, they get logs of doc and another account engaged in sexting - thats digital evidence, to connect those things in court to a real underage human they would need consent and cooperation, how they do it without that?\n\nFor example. There is hundreds of case when victims approach their employer about another coworker harassing them, but they are not going over it to court because they don\u2019t want public attention.",
            "So then they would burn together, and it's still a crime, so then everyone who tried to bury it would also be getting charged. If you worked at twitch, you'd really risk it and not fight an easy to win case in court? The law would be on your side",
            "That's all speculation, you have literally no idea what the circumstances are. Could it be possible? Sure. Additionally, if it was absolutely the thing he was accused of, the victim could've also probably been paid for damages. And finally, the state doesn't always need the victim to move forward with criminal charges, if the sexting happened that would be enough, they wouldn't need testimony if they had a smoking gun",
            ">legally, or factually\n\nNever said they were = to one another.\n\n  \nEither way what does any of this have to do with my point? People will jump on whatever opinion they like the most before any facts are revealed and then hold those positions despite them being wrong.",
            "Agreeing with science doesn't usually mean hating gay people. It just means that you have a more scientifical view on life and reality :)",
            "What are you talking about? If he was sexting a minor as the allegations claim, then he was committing a crime and an NDA doesn't cover that. The allegation isn't that he was being creepy.",
            "When it's done with the vagueness that it happened, people immediately jumped to some sort of crime. Just like if some top athlete was suddenly released from the team with no real reason or explanation, people will assume the worst.",
            "You act like this isn't the 100th time a content creator went down for sexting a minor or worse.",
            "Is every case open to the public? I genuinely don't know but I highly doubt it",
            "Twitch has logs to everything that happens on their platform including docs interactions with the person. He isn\u2019t underage and they don\u2019t need a warrant. You are making things up",
            "^ Bruh's out here with a 4 year degree in Discovery ID. Listen up folks.",
            "The example you used certainly isn\u2019t one I would have chosen to illustrate the point, but you\u2019re not wrong. \n\nNot sure if you\u2019ve ever seen \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d but it\u2019s got some hilarious depictions of tribalist takes.",
            "heck yeah man stick it to the gays\n\nSCIENCE!!!!",
            "I am suggesting there is a level of conduct an adult can have a with a minor that is so god-damn bad but isn't criminal. And a legal layperson would describe that conduct as sexting.",
            "Yeah, all the comments in the original thread were about dmca and shungite, not minors.",
            "In 2020? Not yet, this was just before smash drama even.",
            "Ok im questioning your comprehensive ability. Ofcourse they know and can easily prove connection to a real human behind \"drdisrespect\" account - they have signed contracts with him. \nBUT IT IS NOT ABOUT HIM AND CONNECTING HIM TO THAT ACCOUNT, OK? When i was talking about \" connect those things in court to a real underage human\" i meant possible victim, if it is not somehow obvious enough, ok?\n\nCreating account and being able to send whispers on twitch requires just an email confirmation code, that's it. There is no identity or age confirmation, account alias is not your real name. Victim/parents may have approached twitch initially, but refused cooperate when it came to legal matters.",
            "Please provide an example that's creepy but wouldn't be a valid reason to bring up in court as to fire him for inappropriately talking to a minor",
            "I am not questioning your comprehensive ability. I absolutely know it doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nAs I said in my first comment, he signed a contract with twitch, which would absolutely state you can\u2019t do anything illegal (text a minor) \n\nYeah this isn\u2019t an employer who employs two people and one is harassing the other. One is a massive content creator, the other is a completely unknown person that isn\u2019t tied to the company at all that\u2019s apples to zebras once again it just makes ZERO sense. \n\nif twitch found any wrong doing on his part they wouldn\u2019t pay him out plain and simple. Or you think they would pay off a pedophile and also wouldn\u2019t be obligated to report that in some way or another? So at worst he sexted with some one who was never verified to be a certain age? Who is the person? If we are going to ruin someone\u2019s life over a rumor shouldn\u2019t we at least rely on some facts? Or should we just destroy him for no reason? \n\nSo doc is just sexting with a minor on an account this person didn\u2019t even bother to verify on twitch no less? He is either the single dumbest human being to ever exist or this is just a blatant lie. I\u2019m going to guess blatant lie.\n\nYou understand they would have to terminate his contract and not pay him if they found out he was sexting a minor right? Even if the person didn\u2019t come forward if it was on their platform they still would have an OBLIGATION to not pay him not just a want. If the person didn\u2019t come forward then how can we prove this person is a minor in the first place? How did twitch verify it? So who has the info? The court?? twitch?? And if they do doc would be banned and not paid regardless because it violates his contract. \n\nThe entire thing is so insane I am struggling to keep up with the stupidity",
            "You seem to have a problem grasping what Twitch is able to do regarding the law. If Twitch caught him sexting an underage girl then Twitch would be lawful in terminating Doc's contract and not paying him the rest of his money owed. Whether the underage persons' parents wanted to avoid public attention or not is irrelevant, it's still Twitch's decision whether or not to terminate him and not pay him the rest of his contract."

            "Prior to the clip Tyler makes a lot of interesting points:\n\n- The reason why he was grinding chess 16+ hours a day was to help cope with the pain from his miscarriage; it let him focus and not remember his tragedy\n\n- Says that some hospitals WOULD NOT have helped Macaiyla due to different abortion laws from states (due to ectopic pregnancy being classified as abortion in those states) and they literally would've let Macaiyla outright die\n\n- His brain \"changed\" after the miscarriage where he doesn't weight lift as much as he use to\n\n- Even after his child was born, he personally will think about it once a week-3weeks and every time he does, it still hurts.  He assumes Macaiyla has it worse\n\n- Feels bad for Dantes & Laura since it all aired publicly, hopes they'll get over it eventually but can't imagine what they're going through right now.",

The only questionable thing is why Dantes didn't go with her, but she fucking flew to Germany for the abortion while Google says Dantes lives in Canada and she also has responded echoing Dantes' sentiment.

            "His behavior in game is seen mostly as a meme, but it\u2019s really quite vicious and has never let up once. With this new behavior added on top I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he has some sort of personality disorder.",

            "People have been saying it for years but he's a grade A narcissist. He jokes about it in streams and has seemed to co-opted it a bit. But it's obvious with his complete lack of empathy, always blaming others, everything is about bolstering his own ego and bringing others down.

Instead, they decided to roll the dice and gamble that he wouldn't finally succeed in one of his attempts. \n\nYes, the people around him trying to help were probably getting tired and taking a massive toll on themselves.
