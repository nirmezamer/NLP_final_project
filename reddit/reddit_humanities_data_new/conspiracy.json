ZAKA officials and others dispute that. Regardless, AP\u2019s examination of ZAKA\u2019s handling of the now debunked stories shows how information can be clouded and distorted in the chaos of the conflict.\n\n[...]\n\n\"Still, it took ZAKA months to acknowledge the accounts were wrong, allowing them to proliferate. And the fallout from the debunked accounts shows how the topic of sexual violence has been used to further political agendas.\n\n\"Israel points to sexual violence on Oct. 7 to highlight what it says is Hamas\u2019 savagery and to justify its wartime goal of neutralizing any repeated threat coming from Gaza. It has accused the international community of ignoring or playing down evidence of sexual violence claims, alleging anti-Israel bias. It says any untrue stories were an anomaly in the face of the many documented atrocities.\n\n\"In turn, some of Israel\u2019s critics have seized on the ZAKA accounts, along with others shown to be untrue, to allege that the Israeli government has distorted the facts to prosecute a war \u2014 one in which more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials.\n\n\"A U.N. fact-finding team found \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that some of those who stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7 had committed sexual violence, including rape and gang rape. But the U.N. investigators also said that in the absence of forensic evidence and survivor testimony, it would be impossible to determine the scope of such violence. Hamas has denied its forces committed sexual violence.\n\n[...]\n\n\"Peretz, a U.S.-based artist, said the volunteers weren\u2019t there to do forensic work; he thought the soldiers who cleared the houses of explosives beforehand were handling that process. **But the Israeli military told the AP that the army did not do any forensic work in the wake of Oct. 7.**\n\n\"Bukjin said police forensics teams were mostly focused on the southern cities of Sderot and Ofakim. Otmazgin said forensics workers were present in the kibbutzim but spread thin and could not follow standard \u2014 and painstaking \u2014 protocols because of the scale of the attack. He said forensics teams in the area mostly instructed ZAKA on how to help identify the bodies.\n\n\"That means that bodies which might have shown signs of sexual assault could have eluded examination. Instead, they were loaded into body bags, sent to a facility to be identified and dispatched for quick burial.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to have expected that the aftermath of the attack would be like a movie, that immediately the police would come, that everything would be very sterile and very clean. People who don\u2019t live in a war zone do not understand the horrific chaos that took place that day,\u201d said Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel.\n\n\"The group has spent months gathering evidence of sexual violence that occurred that day, sifting through many accounts emerging from the chaotic early days just after the attack. \u201cSome of those stories that turned out not to be true were not lies,\u201d she said.

            "Idk, I followed alot of the conflict from the start - I am pretty neutral, but Israel has gone too far is my stance. Anyways, I saw some fked up shit from Hamas at the start of it all - There was a video circulating which showed fled Israelis hiding in a bomb shelter, and grenades being thrown into it, and a person would throw it back out, until the last one got him. There is also dashcam footage from a car that recorded it from outside perspective aswell. But the piles of bodies that came out of it, people hiding under the dead bodies to soak up bullets being shot into the shelter, disgusting.\n\nSaddest video I saw was Hamas killing an innocent dog that was in a village, that approached them wagging it's tail, then shot at it, yet it still got up screaming in pain limping towards them, as if pleading for help, not knowing they hurt it. Now if you heard the screams from the dog you might change your narrative, I wish I never saw it, to be honest, I couldn't watch it properly/fully. But hey you know you could just say 'it was israel, they shot the dog and pretended to be hamas'",

Yes, Israel did institute this barbaric policy of better to die than be taken by Hamas, so they shot indiscriminately and inhumanly into crowds, killing hostages and Israelis 100%. \n\nI still think the majority were killed by Hamas that day, also barbaric. Al Jazeera released an incredible documentary on YouTube a few months ago that is really informative and fact based. Lots of what they said in the dock, and was disputed by Israel at the time, and only now is being acknowledged as Israeli lies. If you want to watch it, let me know I can forward the link. \n\nAnyway, both sides bad. Israel oppressive, provocative, and more powerful, what they have been doing is worse and a blight on the western world. But that doesn\u2019t absolve Hamas of brutality toward Israelis, nor mean that Hamas didn\u2019t kill a single person on October 7th. We are allowed to condemn both things.",

(because of Hamas fighters choosing to be in Gaza.) it's awful.\n\nI'm sorry about how horrified, distressed and traumatized your family is. I wish the IDF would of never attacked Gaza.

The Palestinians have no choice but to support Hamas... just as Israeli's have no choice but to pay taxes to the Netenyahu administration and Americans have no choice but to pay taxes to their respective governing bodies.  The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had no choice in retaining the PLO (Yassir Arafat) as their government after the CIA and Israel helped oust them and installed Hamas in it's place. It's no fucking wonder that this stupid ethnic war between Arabs and Jews has been taking place for 100's if not thousands of years... when both sides stoop to such lows. They're both guilty of war crimes and all sorts of other crimes.  But it is interesting to note that Palestinians and Jews lived in relative peace together until the British and wealthy Jewish Zionists took over control of the land and created the modern state of Israel.  We've all seen the maps of Palestinian territory shrink from something like half in 1948 to next to nothing in 2024.  And we haven't forgotten the U.S.S.

On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children. The group, known as the New Life Children's Refuge,[1] did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on kidnapping charges.[2][3] The missionaries denied any wrongdoing and claimed that they were rescuing orphans and leading them to a Dominican hotel which was being transformed into an orphanage. Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but NLCR founder Laura Silsby remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to \"arranging irregular travel\" and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term.[4] On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial\u201d",

Meanwhile, in 2000, the CDC came out with a central repository/database for cancer statistics, likely in response to the upcoming bill ahead of time. It stands to reason that companies involved in the burgeoning big data management used this massive headache of an upcoming problem to their advantage and devised a solution as a selling point in their software which would have included regular cancer statistics- other companies likely caught on. Obviously this is speculation on HOW it happened, but it does stand to reason that a bill passing could cause a shift like that.\n\nIf you look at the Breast and Colon Cancer slides you can see a change in trends around 1990 also- right when the CDC first began collating statistics from the states that had any form of \"central\" repositories.",

These technologies allowed for earlier and more accurate detection of cancers, which could lead to an apparent increase in cancer incidence.\n\n2. Improved Screening Programs: There was a greater emphasis on cancer screening programs, such as mammography for breast cancer, PSA testing for prostate cancer, and colonoscopies for colorectal cancer. These programs increased the detection rates of cancers, particularly at earlier stages.\n\n3. Changes in Reporting and Data Collection: The methods of collecting and reporting cancer data improved, leading to more comprehensive and accurate cancer registries. This might have resulted in an apparent increase in cancer rates due to better documentation.\n\n4. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors: Long-term exposure to environmental pollutants and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, diet, and physical inactivity, could have contributed to cancer incidence. The effects of these factors often become more evident after many years of exposure.\n\n5. Aging Population: As populations age, the incidence of cancer tends to increase because cancer is more common in older individuals. The late 20th century and early 21st century saw an increase in the aging population in many countries.\n\n6.

The 911 attack in New York was a traumatic event but it was definitely amplified by the media, because of 24 hour coverage the entire country, watched the event even people who normally avoid the news. And then, even after that day, more footage was being released every day, for weeks even on channels like MTV there was no avoiding the horror, even if you lived on the other side of the country. It was on every channel in all 65 cable channels and this was before Netflix and streaming options were available. And if I remember correctly, 24 hour channels like CNN were replaying images of the scene for six months to a year. I remember even the weather channel is playing live rescue efforts at Ground Zero with the weather information in the background or split screen. I believe I definitely had an affect on population. The media is responsible for traumatizing millions of people who would\u2019ve otherwise been able to go on with their day to day existence. Before that most Americans had the illusion that we were untouchable from such horror. And then, of course, it started a whole political chain of events. I was 20 at the time and I know guys who never consider joining the military, voluntarily signing up that same week I will go down the whole rabbit hole the series of events followed, but bare minimum that one event could be the fork in the road that led up to the extreme left/right devision we are still seeing today. The singularity \u2026. Before that, a persons political party was mostly private maybe a sign in the yard every four years but it was definitely not a constant talking point, your neighbor might have voted for a different candidate but you would still invite them over for a barbecue on the weekend for example. And there were plenty of other things to talk about, nothing like the extreme devision we see today. I wish there was someway to hold the media companies accountable like a class, action lawsuit or something for giving the entire country PTSD. Let\u2019s get real parties are pretty much mascots and liking one mascot more than the other should not invoke a fight or flight reaction between siblings or sometimes even between parents and their children. It\u2019s possibly driven by a need to feel control, the illusion of safety. At least three generations lost that illusion on 9/11/2001. And the generations that have common sense don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like to feel like there is hope for the future. I don\u2019t know how to scientifically prove this but I can definitely see all that having something to do with a rise in terminal cancer. my question is how do you fix it? How can we heal?

We observed that most frequencies were tumor-specific. Indeed, when the analysis of frequencies is restricted to tumor types analyzed following a minimum of 60 frequency detection sessions (breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer), at least 75% of frequencies appear to be tumor-specific. (**Some frequencies such as 1873.477 Hz, 2221.323 Hz, 6350.333 Hz and 10456.383 Hz are common to the majority of patients** with a diagnosis of breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. \n\n~\n\n2221.323 hz...\n\n\"Know a cancer frequency\" = **222** alphabetic | **2022** english-extended\n\nCancer is an endless copying of cells.\n\n\"A copy of a copy of a copy\" = **222** alphabetic\n\n~\n\nCellphones.\n\n\"Cellphones cause cancer\" = **202** alphabetic\n\n~\n\nHarmonics and overtones of a frequency.\n\nOne of the identified cancer frequency signatures is 1873.477 Hz, which can translate harmonically to 1873.477 Mhz.\n\nSound waves grow in amplitude when adding waves that are harmonically related and in phase.

            "I'll retort with this: if one is the argue that said 'increase' is *solely* tied to changes in the reporting of [non-cancerous brain tumors](https://i.imgur.com/mWiCQXO.png), then what has caused  those increasing so rapidly? Once the recording change is made, shouldn't the adjustment and adjustment be fairly linear? Clearly, something else is going on.  \n\nI think this is a very good point that may result in a blip, but it does not tell the full story. That said, the full story can't really be told without the source of this dataset and supplemental research. And while datasets can be valuable for further inquiry to isolate variables, conclusions can't really be drawn until other means are exhausted. I can't say it enough: social media screenshots of a single graph with no datasets, sources, and referenced studies are mostly useless. And even studies can be useless, depending on the methodology and origin of the study. This screenshot alone is almost meaningless without context and even with context, *total cases* is fairly meaningless without per capita measurements. \n\nA few thoughts, but again we do not have any information about the source of this data, researchers analysis, etc.,. Cancer diagnosis and treatment drastically improved around that time, which is fantastic for the prognosis of young people. Sadly, that also means cases that come out of remission. Usually the methodology explains whether or not this counts as a \"second case\" or is part of \"all cases.\" \n\nAlso: as each year passes, the year of persons under 50 born also increases. IE: those under 50 in 2020 were born in 1970 and those under 50 born in 2000 were born in 1950. There were a lot of babies born from '45-'65 and that definitely has a lot of weight on a dataset. Not only is it a massive pool of individuals exposed to different variables, but you also have the size of subsequent generations & considerations for bioaccumulation.

            "I\u2019m a young person with multiple digestive diseases unusual in young people and am at very high risk for colon cancer. I think there are multiple reasons for the increase in digestive disease in young people but I have to say, for myself, I strongly, strongly believe antibiotics were the main factor. My entire childhood I was dispensed antibiotics very frequently due to an unrelated condition and had to take them several times a year. From childhood to young adulthood any time my mom took me to the doctor for a cold, ear infection, etc. I was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics. I have had acne since I was 12 and was put on various antibiotics through the years to control my acne (did absolutely nothing for the acne) and was instructed to take them continually for months. I became very ill with all of the digestive conditions at age 26; in the 3 years prior to everything falling apart I had been given about 10 rounds of antibiotics for various things; a few respiratory infections (which were probably viral anyway), UTI, after oral surgery to prevent infection. I was never told to take probiotics or anything (no idea if that would have even helped). I personally was raised by a health nut and processed foods were not a big part of my diet prior to getting sick (but I believe processed foods are a big part of it for many people). Anyway all of this is to say, as someone who has several of the conditions you mentioned, I really honestly believe you\u2019re correct about antibiotics and that this wouldn\u2019t have happened to me if antibiotics hadn\u2019t been overprescribed to me my whole life/if I\u2019d known the dangers and been able to advocate for myself.",

It's got all the same stuff inside down to most of the same dna. A lot of cancer your immune system can identify, but not all of them, the harmful cancers people die from often aren't attacked by WBC. A disease is easy it's something completely different. It doesn't look, act, respond the same as you, and finding something that kills a bacteria but is harmless to you is relatively stright forward. So far, the only way we have of having our medicine target cancer instead of healthy cells is cancer grows quicker. So, it has a quicker uptake of materials to build more of itself. Basically, the idea is if we inject something harmful, the cancer wanting to absorb all the material to grow will absorb most of this poison and die off. As it sounds, this isn't perfect because some of the poison does get absorbed by healthy cells, especially if they are naturally fast growing, i.e., hair and nails. It's a lot more refined and nuanced than this explanation makes it seem. But while I'm sure big pharama makes money (cause why would big phrama not), there isn't a good way to just cure cancer.

The state of California has basically claimed every substance known to man can cause cancer in some way so it\u2019s not actually finding a cure it\u2019s more like removing what triggers the mutations. Some claim it comes from long term exposure to toxic substances which it probably is in a lot of cases but I was diagnosed with cancer at 18 months of age so I hadn\u2019t been around long enough to have long term exposure to anything and didn\u2019t live in an area known for any kind of extraordinary factors to cause it. Cancer itself is an entirely different beast than any of the conditions you mentioned since they were all caused by foreign introduction of a virus or bacterial substance, not something already in the human body that decided to mutate.",
            "Exactly. All we can do is thank good ol\u2019 Woodrow for going out of his way to create this magnificent system!",
            "Republicans were basically the only ones to vote against it in the senate too. \n\nI wonder if that sentiment would be different today, given they have seen the insane modern monetary policy & damage it\u2019s causing."
