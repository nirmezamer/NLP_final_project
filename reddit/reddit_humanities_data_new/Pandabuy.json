        "content": "Dear valued users,\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your continued attention and support to Pandabuy. Recently, our company has encountered legal issues related to our services, as our senior management is actively cooperating with the police investigation. Currently, we are fully collaborating with the relevant authorities to ensure that all our business activities comply with legal regulations.\n\nWe understand that this situation may have caused inconvenience and concern for you. Please rest assured that we are actively addressing these issues and commit to keeping you informed of any developments. In the meantime, our team and the authorities are taking every necessary measure to protect your rights and ensure data security.\n\nWe kindly ask for your patience and understanding as we strive to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. During this challenging period, we pledge to prioritize serving you to the best of our abilities.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your understanding and support and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n\nPandabuy's online customer service, community management, and other departments will begin handling your inquiries today. If your questions have not been answered yet, please be patient with our customer service and mods. Due to the high volume of inquiries, we will do our best to respond to you as soon as possible.\n\nTo help users understand the situation more quickly, we have collected some of the most frequently asked questions below:\n\n**Regarding Orders and Packages**  \nQ: Can I still place orders on the platform?  \nA: Currently, Pandabuy accounts cannot conduct transactions such as recharging, paying orders, or handling packages. The police investigation is still not over, our warehouse is still not back to normal, and due to the freezing of some of our funds, We are currently unable to provide services such as top-ups and withdrawals at this time. We are negotiating with the third-party payment company to restore the function as soon as possible for everyone to use, once restored, we will make an announcement in the community and the platform. Please be patient for a while, Pandabuy will still provide you with the best service.\n\nQ: What should I do if the seller does not ship the goods?  \nA: You can contact purchasing consultation; the shipping time depends on the seller.\n\nQ: What should I do if purchasing does not reply? What is the response time?  \nA: Purchasing has begun replying to customer inquiries in sequence. Due to the large volume of inquiries, please be patient.\n\nQ: Is my stored order/package/account/order/parcel on the way safe? / What if parcels in the warehouse cannot be shipped? Should I cancel the parcel? Do I need to submit the parcel?  \nA: Please understand that we are actively addressing the current issues. Please remain patient, and we will resume normal operations as soon as possible. Please wait for official announcements regarding the restoration time, at which point warehouse colleagues will proceed with signing, inspection, packaging, and shipping tasks in sequence. If you have related order or parcel needs, you can contact online customer service again. If your parcel is in transit, it will not be affected.\n\n**Regarding Refunds**  \nThe platform is still cooperating with the investigation and the warehouse is still organising goods. Regarding your item/parcel, we are still waiting for the results of the investigation and the results of the sorting before we can confirm the final status and resolution. So we are temporarily holding your refund request. We fully understand the anxiety of everyone waiting, please give us time. We will do our best to resume normal operations as soon as possible. Thank you again for your understanding and support.\n\n**Regarding Logistics**  \nQ: Any situation requiring consultation with the logistics department, such as abnormal logistics trajectories, insurance, redelivery, compensation, and after-sales inquiries.  \nA: For inquiries regarding your parcel status, please contact the logistics provider for verification. Please wait for official announcements regarding the restoration time, and we will assist you with your inquiries at that time.\n\nThis April has been particularly challenging for Pandabuy. However, we will persevere and overcome this difficulty. We earnestly ask everyone to have more patience and understanding towards Pandabuy, and we also appreciate everyone's attention to Pandabuy. We are actively cooperating with investigations, and we will correct any problems identified. Even if there are no problems, we will conduct internal reforms and reflections to continue providing everyone with a satisfactory shopping platform.\n\nSinserely,  \nPandabuy Team",

            "You guys don't understand anything and just talk for the sake of it. Let's see, in China, they conduct inspections on industries and other small businesses (government-related issues) every year searching for imitations. This \"attack\" is known as \"315\" (March 15th, inspections starting around this date). It's very likely that Pandabuy is already prepared for this, and most of the imitation products are stored in more hidden places so that when inspection comes, they can't find anything. What I'm telling you is a theory since the Chinese experience this every year. Pandabuy has gained a lot of international fame and therefore undergoes this inspection. (I'm the CEO of an import company from Asia and involved in international buying and selling, and this issue is the same every year, I know very well what I'm talking about).\n\nWhat to do in these cases with a package that's in the warehouse? Wait, they may not find anything in this inspection, and in a few weeks, they may allow you to send your merchandise.\n\nAny other doubts we can help you:\n\nWeChat ID: galleryvam\nWhatsApp (English) : +1 786 929 3537\nWhatsApp (Spanish) : +34 624 45 25 77\nWhatsApp (Chinese) : +86 155 284 39701\nWebsite: galleryvam.com\nYupoo: galleryvam.x.yupoo.com",

Getting sued by 16 different powerhouses can be catastrophic for the business, so they definitely know how to get out of this mess. Furthermore they make it easy for b2c global trade, making the Chinese government a whole lotta money. Also the companies suing are all American/european so the government will stand by the home business, because they know that all the companies will not leave china to produce elsewhere no matter what, raiding one warehouse is just a stunt to show the world that \u2018action is being taken\u2019.",

            "Good morning, hope you had a nice hibernation.",
            "bruh pandabuy isn\u2019t coming back, forget about the items and chargeback ur money bro",
            "someone tell him",
            "Go ahead and get your refund, champ.",
            "That was exactly what they want. To escape from refund. Items will be destroyed once it expires on the storage",
            "Would PayPal find it suspicious that I\u2019m charging back orders from a while ago?",
            "I paid debit card can I get a refund or am I fuked",
            "It\u2019s dead PandaBuy",
            "[removed]",
            "Is there any alternative? Please write a dm",
            "Forget about your stuff the police probably took it and your not seeing that ever again",
            "Yes your items won't expired. We had extended the storage time for all of you. Just ignore the prompt.",
            "ive requested chargeback, and i havent got a single penny for my chargebacks used Revolut",
            "Do you know how to do a chargeback please?",
            "can i chargeback if i paid via bank",
            "I am aware panda buy have been raided but on the off chance any of our items are recovered i just wanted to know if they will still be in \u2018our warehouses\u2019",
            "did you use it through paypal cuz paypal can refund too",
            "Read my other comment under this post",
            "Should we ignore the police presence at the warehouse too?",
            "idk what revolut is but all my chargebacks worked thru paypal lol",
            "i used revolut and got it back, 4 seperate payments",
            "Why would they be recovered? they\u2019re counterfeit items, police will destroy them",
            "No I bought 2 hauls and used debit",
            "i wish i used paypal, sucks to be me",
            "hi, can you walk me through on how you chargeback via paypal?",
            "i mean i used 3 separate payments and none got chargebacked yet, still waiting, they havent refused either so hopes up",
            "For items that are not counterfeit like blank t shirts, trackpants etc.",
            "nah all mine were rejected by paypal apart from one that instantly got accepted, i think they will refund wallet balance but not items in warehouse although i could be mistaken",
            "message me i\u2019ll show u how to do it",
            "Most likely gone for good, Pandabuy won\u2019t be back from this, CEO been imprisoned etc etc.",
            "don\u2019t be a spastic and use logic to comprehend the situation.",
            "yeah maybe, all of my refunds were wallet balance",
            "Logically thinking if they are being raided for selling counterfeit items why would non counterfeit items be seized. I am aware pandabuy is most likely gone for good but just wanted to ask a justified question about items I\u2019ve paid for to see if it\u2019s worth trying to stick it out or just chargeback",
            "The company will go bankrupt. They won't be active anymore. It's over. If you're aware Pandabuy is most likely over (it is), you should know what to do.",
            "You are acting very ignorant in your thinking. You think the government is going to go through things item by item to determine what is counterfeit and what is not? PandaBuy is know for selling counterfeit items. Period. Everything is being destroyed"
