        "content": "**Hello there.**\n\nYou might've noticed the subreddit's mod list has changed a few times over the last three months, and we'd like to inform you as to why along with our vision for the future of the community.\n\nTo start off, my name is Asher, and I along with the other current moderators on the team have been involved in community management for several years, and are going to be handling mod operations on r/Money moving forward.\n\nWhile we're still investigating the cause, the previous two mod teams were removed for a combination of being inactive (why you were seeing so many low effort/quality posts the last few weeks) and violating **Reddit's** [**Moderator Code of Conduct**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), specifically the part regarding **moderating with integrity (R5)**.\n\nAs of this moment, we are working on implementing new ways to ensure transparency in the actions we take to uphold civility and focus on the subreddits central topic, money. This will be done to reduce the risk of anything similar to the previously mentioned behaviors taking place by any individual member on the team in the future. The goal of this subreddit is and has always been to foster a community focused on the discussion of anything related to money and financial moves, and bad actors taking advantage of positions of power impacts everyone involved negatively.\n\nOver the next few days, there will be more changes to the subreddit (formatting, rules and guidelines, and the creation of subreddit-specific wiki pages) to further encourage positive/conducive user activity.\n\nIf you have any further questions, comments, suggestions, or concerns, feel free to forward them to us directly via Reddit [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMoney).\n\nThank you for being a part of our community, and best regards,\n\nu/AsherFennec, u/ARoyaleWithCheese, u/ddftgr2a, u/lmaodaniel, u/Randomperson0012, u/strikingsubsidy27, u/sled603, and u/f0rkster",

If you don't have a safe neighborhood, ask someone to go with you. If you do have safe places to do this, take some headphones and listen to music. Make playlists to pass the time. Then drive home. If you get home and you are feeling hungry/craving something, make yourself a hot tea to sip on (decaf) and go to bed early to prevent those cravings, if needed. When you wake up you'll feel better. The next day, do it again.   \n  \nIf you want to stop driving to go on walks, just walk around your house/area.

This will lead to more mental problems because of bodyshame etc and is basically a downwards spiral of where you\u2019re only a slave to the fast food industry. \n\nSo how do you fix this?\n1. Fast food isn\u2019t a hard drug to quit but tell your parents, if they aren\u2019t abusive, about your debt.\n\n2. Hit the gym. Lifestyle changes are important and you probably need to learn about health, cardio or at least you\u2019ll get a routine and discipline. \n\n3. Go to the gym and with your friends. It\u2019s easier to go together than alone and you\u2019ll help yourself get better. \n\n4. Don\u2019t eat fast food. The money that even would be in your budget for food should go into your gym membership at least for the next year and when you eat fast food next time do it knowing how you react to it so you don\u2019t go that downwards spiral.\n\nAnd pay your debt man.",

Pack a lunch box with your favorite snacks or food. I know people might talk shit but if you got the food you like who cares.\n\n2. Take a different route or hang out with different people\n\n3. TRACK THE WEEKLY cost then multiply by 4, then by 12 now you know how much you pay in a year. This should motivate you somewhat. Think about what kind of car, gaming system, bike whatever it is you would like almost any of them would be bought and paid off within 5 years\n\n4. Learn about different foods through documentary videos.  Trust me if you watch a couple it will slow you for sure.\n\n5. Set a goal and slowly track your progress.

Plus delete every app that you can order food from there should be no easy way to get this food. Honestly it sounds like you are opposed to cooking for yourself and using the resources around you so idk if me telling you that will help but ask your family for recipes and ways you can make meals that will last a couple days.

YOU have to realize what you\u2019re doing and stop it from happening. Or else it\u2019s just gonna take over and destroy you. Drink a cold glass of water whenever you crave fast food.

So much easier to learn one recipe and stick with it than do 12 recipes and not be able to keep up with the different meal preps. \nIf you have access, bring the meal with you to a gas station that has a microwave, this will let you heat up your food and then eat a hot meal. My lunches include meal prep approx 480 cal, 150g of raw broccoli, and 250g of fresh fruit (strawberries, grapes, oranges, kiwi, etc). Eat slow. Try to really enjoy your food. No phone.

I get three full heads of broccoli for $4. That lasts me a whole week. Rice, chicken, spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, etc, MAX $80 (west coast USA). And that will last me 2-3 weeks of meal prep. \nThe first step to real change is trying to identify the problem, if you see spending money on fast food as an issue, work on getting healthier snacks, healthier meals, during work hours and you\u2019ll be set. \n\nI\u2019m a little drunk so sorry if this doesn\u2019t make sense.

Food is such a big and unnecessarily high expense for so many people but you really can eat well for not a lot if you are smart. My wife and I are late 20s, and cook probably 98% of our meals and eat out once a quarter (but usually it's a nice fancy sit down place, $100-200). We shop with coupons, buy in bulk, and shop multiple stores to get the cheapest prices. I'd guess we save $4000-5000/year doing this vs just eating out whenever and wherever we want and shopping at the most convenient spot. That's more than most Americans save for retirement. If you can master your mind and emotions and resist the urge to avoid these bad small decisions, you'll be able to accomplish goals you never could have even imagined before.\n\nI don't know how old you are, but the amount you're spending on fast food is enough to make you an extra million dollars by retirement if you're in your early 20s if you invested the money instead. And you'd be healthier to boot. You know what you need to do, just do it.

            "Thanks ChatGPT lol  \n  \nThe price of an airplane ticket is determined by various factors that contribute to the overall cost of operating flights and providing air travel services. Here's a breakdown of what goes behind the price of an airplane ticket:\n\n1. \\*\\*Fuel Costs\\*\\*: Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines. The price of jet fuel can fluctuate based on global oil prices, affecting ticket prices.\n2. \\*\\*Operating Costs\\*\\*: This includes expenses such as aircraft maintenance, crew salaries, ground handling services, and administrative costs.\n3. \\*\\*Aircraft Depreciation\\*\\*: Airlines factor in the cost of purchasing or leasing aircraft over their operational lifespan.\n4. \\*\\*Airport Fees and Charges\\*\\*: Airlines pay fees to airports for using runways, terminals, and other facilities. These fees can vary by airport and impact ticket prices.\n5. \\*\\*Taxes and Government Fees\\*\\*: Passengers pay various taxes and fees, such as airport departure taxes, security fees, and international arrival/departure taxes. These are typically passed on to passengers as part of the ticket price.\n6. \\*\\*Insurance and Safety Costs\\*\\*: Airlines invest in safety measures, insurance coverage, and regulatory compliance, which contribute to operational expenses.\n7. \\*\\*Labor Costs\\*\\*: Salaries and benefits for pilots, cabin crew, ground staff, and administrative personnel are significant factors in determining ticket prices.\n8. \\*\\*Marketing and Distribution\\*\\*: Costs associated with advertising, promotions, and distribution channels (including online booking platforms and travel agencies) are included in the ticket price.\n9. \\*\\*Aircraft Utilization\\*\\*: The efficiency with which an airline uses its aircraft affects costs. Higher utilization rates can help spread fixed costs over more flights, potentially lowering ticket prices.\n10. \\*\\*Demand and Competition\\*\\*: Ticket prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, as well as competitive pressures within the airline industry and specific routes.\n11. \\*\\*Profit Margin\\*\\*: Airlines aim to generate a profit margin from ticket sales to sustain operations, invest in fleet upgrades, and provide shareholder returns.\n\nUnderstanding these factors helps passengers comprehend why ticket prices vary and why certain routes or airlines may be more expensive than others. Additionally, external factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes can also impact airline ticket prices.",
