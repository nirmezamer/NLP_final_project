I haven't whaled but I've definitely but some money into the game since I've been enjoying the hell out of this game.  Here's my current [NIKKE roster](https://imgur.com/a/5gOXmkL)\n\nSome general notes/questions I had:\n\n* I used silver mileage tickets to finish rounding out my 5th overlimit unit, so I'm able to break the 160 wall in a few more levels when I reach it.  I have a spare body selector leftover, should I be holding on to this, or just immediately slap it onto someone like Alice who is part of the limited pool of candidates?\n* The main omissions from my wishlist are currently Noir and Liter so I'm going to leave them, but now that I have 5 units at MLB, should I change my standard recruit wishlist to be entirely NIKKEs I don't have?  Or should I do a balance of new units + OL meta units I already have like Alice?\n* Overall it seems like I'm entering the phase where the game slows down.  I made my first piece of T9M gear which was very expensive, finished Chapter 18 which has been very difficult (daily use NIKKEs are becoming less and less effective), and started doing Interception EX.  Is the main focus now to just play small amounts, farm EX gear, let resources build up, and save for limited recruit pulls?\n* Seems like the incentive to do standard recruit pulls with gems is very low now that I have 5x MLB.  I would still like a Liter pull but the odds of that are super low, do people just generally stop doing standard recruit pulls completely once you break 160?\n* I've barely touched the collection items and have no idea what favorite items are but I think I just unlocked that tat the tactics academy",

            "If you really wanted to commit to this build, then Privaty would be a natural fit in this team. Privaty's mag size debuff will help proc Dorothy's CDR more often (Not to mention Helm has last bullet effects too), and her reload speed buff will synergize with Crown's buff to allow Modernia to near instant reload.\n\nThat being said, I think you'll find most people will urge you to build around Liter instead since she is the more meta B1 for campaign, especially as you approach closer to endgame and pull more strong DPSs (you didn't post your roster, do you have any other DPSs of note?) Right now Dorothy and Liter might perform similarly on your team because of investment differences, and also by the fact that your only DPS of note is Modernia. Liter's strength (among many others) is that she is a highly potent attack buffer, but without another strong DPS in the place of Helm, you might not be able to appreciate that effect at the moment, with Dorothy being able to pick up the slack, so to speak, with her own decent damage output. \n\nStick with Dorothy if you'd like, especially in early/mid game, but I would highly suggest to invest into Liter on the side, as there will be a time where she will eventually outperform solidly over Dorothy for campaign. If you have an attachment to Dorothy, then no worries, Dorothy is still very relevant in raids, being part of the current highest damage team in a neutral setting (Dorothy/Crown/SBS/Alice/Privaty)",
            "Just kick Liter out if you want. It won't affect your team much even if meta slave said so. At most you team would only be able to beat xx0000 instead of xx1000 if you use Dorothy instead of Liter. Big fucking deal, still way better than using 2 fuck burst 1 like now.",
            "No point in running two B1s. Pick between liter or dorothy.\n\nLiter is better for general story as she has faster CDR, cover repair, and big atk buff at start of burst. Dorothy's main skill is her brand, but it is too slow for story to screenclear (by the time it goes off, you already killed everything it will hit or you are already dead). She is more for bossing. Free privaty helps improve her CDR and brand dmg, and free privaty+crown can lead to infinite ammo during burst if reload speed >110%.\n\nendgame with liter = Crown / liter / Naga / Modernia / pick another B3 - ideally RH\n\nendgame with dorothy = Crown / dorothy / naga / modernia / RH or free privaty (bursting for AOE stun) OR crown / dorothy / modernia / RH / free privaty (nonburst for atk/reload buff)\n\nCrown+naga is typically stronger than Crown+free privaty.",

            "they don't do it because there's no incentive for them to. Why would they buff weaker units when they could release a new unit/alt instead.

Or when they could milk 4-6 months' worth content by locking their buffs  behind a grind or convoluted system.\n\nnote that almost every gacha does this; some just manage/disguise it better.",
            "Some various reasons\n\n-having bad units exist isn't a bad thing, bad units make good units look better, and fill up the perma pool to make people pull for the \"real\" ssrs and not the purples with gold paint.\n\n-it costs dev time to fix a unit that could otherwise be spent on making a nee unit, especially in a game as p2w as nikke if they fuck up and overbuff a mid unit and make it feel like they will be top tier it could cause people to stop spending to set very high expectations their old units will compete with new ones\n\n-more work with new art or animations (not really an issue with nikke but other gachas can give a reworked unit new art)\n\nIf you look at how nikke did it they basically did the \"create problem sell solution\" thing where not only do you need dupes but you also need the doll mats that people will spend gem refreshes to get faster or potentially spend on units for solo raid rosters they otherwise wouldn't. \n\nJust to give examples of previous gachas I played:\n\nGirls frontline - buffed units with new \"mod\" system cost a bunch of resources and redid all art and massively buffed skills - took story units and made them SSR top top tier units\n\nAzur lane - retrofit system took units and upgraded their rarity 1 up and added or buffed skills. Cost a chunk of resources but very achievable, bunch ended up meta\n\n(Just to note the above 2 games are more collectors that made money with skins so had less reason to worry about potential power creep although power creep still happened)\n\nDragalia lost - mana spirals which were basically just kit updates and reworks, a bunch of which made even 3 and 4* units very meta and strong. In some cases it was just temporary for weaker ones but then they reworked former-meta units into total monsters. Cost some mats you could whale for but everyone who played for long enough had way way too many extra mats so it didn't matter. In the end this game died because it made no money, too f2p friendly and whaling felt awful (for reference imagine if nikke had 5x the free pulls but 4x lower ssr rate, but pulls cost like 4x as much real money, but you didn't need dupes, also it didn't have good pity/spark until a year in + super skill based and turbo grind endgame)",
            "> is there an official reason for not just straight up buffing weaker Nikkes?\n\nFrom what I understand, it's just how laws and liability works in south korea.\n\nIf they change something you paid for and you are no longer happy with it, you are potentially entitled to compensation. The only thing that seems to avoid this are straight numeric buffs - not \"making a kit better\" but \"taking that 2% and turning it into a 5-10-20%\" which often doesn't fix underlying problems. Whatever you bought (even in gacha form) could have this apply, so if you spent a few hundred (because gacha's are fucking expensive) optimizing laplace for a last bullet setup and they just straight up deleted that and put in the \"new\" post treasure full charge laplace, you could sue and have a reasonable chance at getting your money back. If they make \"treasures\" as an optional upgrade they didn't actually change anything and there is no liability for them there.\n\nTo an extent I appreciate it, especially when I look at games like league of legends where they periodically just delete old/underplayed champions and re-use their names for new ones. It does however have its own problems and issues though.",
            "treasure system is a way to buff nikkes that encourages spending (more pulls for 2-stars, then having to max bond, then having to RNG for dolls and doll XP mats).\n\nit is also a tedious very RNG-heavy farming system to give endgame players something to do. Heavily RNG systems are best for games with insanely huge whales, because they need to overwhale to overcome RNG.\n\nthe nikke formula is like 85% trash nikkes, 10% semi-useful niche nikkes, 5% meta nikkes. if you realize that, you know how to save/spent your pulls.\n\neven the treasure nikkes change from trash nikkes to either still trash or trash/semi-useful into semi-useful niche nikkes... so it doesn't really even matter much realistically.",

I'd direct you there if you want to do more reading. This is just what I do and feel comfortable with based on my personal risk tolerances.\n\nI manually dispatch any missions that give cores or credits or at least 25 gems.

I also pass on any doll mileage x30 or below, but that's up to you if you want to pull for more dolls. After all that, if there are at least 7+ rerollable slots, it's usually worth spending the gems to reroll once. Doing this, mathematically you get about as good of a return on gems as buying out event stamina for hard mode core dust.\n\nWith regards to the shop core dust purchasable with credits, if you do the conversion, you are losing out technically. You are buying 1 or 2 hours of core dust for usually more than 1 or 2 hours of credits, but the idea is that you are always bottlenecked by core dust especially before level 300. If you're finding yourself running out of credits a lot then you don't have to - I find that the deal shows up in the store rarely enough for it not to make a huge difference in the long term.

I cannot imagine a world where I am low on credits, since my fodder cannot keep up with my credits as is. I guess I am below 250 synchro and credit costs increase at 251+ and 301+. I kinda have trouble evaluating how much value you are getting from rerolling dolls though, since it's a new system, your strategy makes sense to me though.",
            "Hmm... Are you perhaps omitting the gem recouping that occurs with dispatch refresh? The original strategy involves (along with credits/cores) locking in all the gems upon daily reset, regardless of the number of gems. When you refresh the dispatch slots with 50 gems, not only are you expected to get a certain amount of core dust proportional to the slots refreshed, you \\*also\\* are expected to get some gems back by virtue of simply rerolling into more gems. \n\n  \nThere's a good calculator here written by Prydwen writer Kisenix [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t\\_OTPCzEklWK5OQ6YzmpnCanfUWxprEivrDUpSLKeoc/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_OTPCzEklWK5OQ6YzmpnCanfUWxprEivrDUpSLKeoc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nIt basically shows that at 7 dispatch refresh slots, you are expected to use 13 gems (50-37 recouped) for an average of 1.52h of core dust. An overall value of 1h core dust for 8.7 gems, which is only rivaled in value with the event stamina buyout. Extra wipeouts already cost 25 gems per 1h of core dust. Of course, the fine print here is that you are reliant on RNG, so you would have to do this consistently over time to converge on these values.",
            "I disagree on your priority list. Here is the personal math I did on dispatches.\n\nFor dispatches, I assigned each individual dispatch a \"gem-equivalent\" value. For core dust, you'd have to value it between these numbers: **1h=5gems** (buying stamina), **1h=11 gems** (equivalent to buying 30 day resource pack, and comparing to special recruit pack 1 at $20 = 20 pulls = 6k gems, and $15 = 1210 gems +300h dust, gives 1h core dust =11gems), or 1 wipe out at 50gems = 2h core dust, so **1h=25gems**. I then gave credits a \"gem value\" of 1/4 of core dust, because like you said you'd pay 150k credits for 1h core dust, which for me personally is ~4h of credits. I then did some math on molds and some relatively conservative estimations put 1 SR mold at 5 gems and 1 SSR mold at 15 gems.\n\nSo from there, you'd take the average of your 1 dispatch, and then reroll if it is below that average. Then see how many rerolled dispatches you'd need to reach 50 gems. For me this was about 7.\n\n[Here is the math with a value of 1h core dust = 5 gems](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609963920056254467/1252804715423469578/image.png?ex=66738cd0&is=66723b50&hm=8015309fc5e2613c5d34f8f3b4ff30723fdb5e743e44ed8f1a0fa7678140395c&)\n\n[Here is the math with a value of 1h core dust = 11 gems](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609963920056254467/1252804895304843264/image.png?ex=66738cfb&is=66723b7b&hm=09231b882f240dd180a837bf0259b20d6aa7314f5c8843dd0302525c223314ee&)\n\nThe number at the bottom is the average gem value you'd gain from rerolling X 0 value dispatches. With the first it was 7 bad dispatches and with the second it was 6 bad dispatches. This isn't even taking into account collection dispatches at all and I'm not even going to try to assign gem values to such an abstract system. I know this isn't perfect and you may disagree with my assumptions but I think this logic is sound.\n\nI do not understand the logic of doing even 1 or 2 wipeouts for core dust. If you are a paying player in any way focused on value, wipeout at 1h core dust = 25 gems is way way worse than monthly resource pack at 1h = 11gems if you'd be spending a small amount of money to get the best packs at 300gems/dollar otherwise. I understand that once you start going past the \"best value\" packs for pulls/gems the pulls/gems per dollar go down fast. But personally I would never buy them so that's what my math assumes.\n\n[Here is the link to the google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aGk1-82NFQrSlCuHBZ0zkDif6C05kVT1_gk7HbiVqP8/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'll test Guillotine vs Scarlet directly in a team with and without healer (So at low HP and full HP)\n\nThe Doro/Crown/SBS/Alice/Priv team is either Team 1 or Team 2 now. \n\nI'm not sure where if the S.Anis Electric Team dropped to since S.Anis was not used much by the top rankers during the GraveDigger SR since the Shotgun Team outperformed it (B.Soda being Iron was big for this SR)\n\nThe reason Doro Privaty found its way into that team is because of this train of reasoning. \n\n1. SBS + Alice is the highest DPS B3 combo in the game currently.\n2. SBS and Alice both have huge Atk% Self buffs, so to fully utilize it, they needed a multiplicative effect. Crown (Atk Damage buff) or Blanc (Increase Damage Taken) were the candidates here. Crown was the better option since her buffs were stronger and allowed for more team flexibility.\n3. Now the B1 and 5th unit spots to further buff the duo is even more limited since Atk% and Atk Damage buffs were mostly covered. Privaty's reload speed was another way to buff the team when paired with Crown's own reload speed buff. (More hits for Alice and SBS to fit in during their burst window with instant reload). \n4. Now B1 needs to be a CDR unit, and Liter was not as good since Crown/Priv both have Atk% buffs as well as Alice and SBS's own massive self buffs. \n5. This pushed our CDR options to Dorothy or Volume since KW:D doesnt work well with SBS/Alice.\n6. Volume buffs just performed worse since Crit scaling in this game is not very good. The crown and privaty buffs on the other hand were big for Dorothy's personal damage. So Dorothy ended up as the B1 slot. \n\nThings might change though since Crown hasnt been out for long. We might see the teams evolve again with summer coming soon.\n\nIt might also change depending on the boss itself since the highest DMG version of this team against Gravedigger was actually Crown/SBS/Alice/S.Helm.\n\nBut that is only because S.Helm's increase damage taken for enemies weak to Iron was a multiplier in this equation and she didnt need to burst.",

May do it on my spender account.",
            "That is an interesting perspective.\n\nThe reason you come up with that conclusion is because you are converting all core dust value to fixed best gem value (from farming hard events) and then calculating based on that. the gem value of core dust actually fluctuates depending on where you are getting it from. AKA you are actually spending much more gems via daily dispatch per 1-h core dust compared to farming core dust from events, so using the farming core dust gem value for core dust gives misleading results.\n\nHere is how you should look at daily dispatch and you will see how it is giving a much lower value for gems to core dust conversion than what you are thinking.\n\nFrom daily dispatch, the probability breakdown goes like this:\n\n* 23.43% for gems\n* 66.86% for trash (including credit boxes, molds, bond tixs... it is not actually worth converting gems into any of those items, so it is really a net loss)\n* 9.71% for core dust = (4\\*0.4286+4\\*1.4286+4\\*0.5714)\n\nAverage core dust per success = 2.2353 hour of core dust = 2h\\*(4\\*0.4286/9.7144)+2h\\*(4\\*1.4286/9.7144)+3h\\*(4\\*0.5714/9.7144)\n\n* For 7 open slots = 51.09% of hitting at least once on 9.71% core dust option\n* For 6 open slots = 45.83% of hitting at least once on 9.71% core dust option \\[this will be even less if one of the claimed dispatch slots is already a core dust option\\]\n\nIt costs 50 gems to refresh daily dispatch once. On average, it will take two daily refreshes (which is 100 gems) for average 2.2353 hour of core dust.\n\n**So the true value of 1h core dust from daily dispatch is \\~44.73 gems spent on average, and 2h core dust from daily dispatch costs 89.46 gems spent on average.**\n\nFrom wipe-outs, it is 50 gems for 1st gem wipe out for 2h core dust, so 1h core dust only costs 25 gems. 2nd gem wipe out is 70 gems for 2h core dust, so 1h core dust costs 35 gems. 3rd gem wipe out is 100 gems, so 1h core dust costs 50 gems.\n\nThe average gem value of daily dispatch refresh core dust is better than the 3rd gem wipe out, but worst than the 1st and 2nd gem wipe out.\n\n* **1 year of 1st 50 gem wipe out will give 720 hours of core dust for 18,000 gems**\n* **1 year of 1st 50 gem daily refresh for 7 slots will give average of 399.705 hours of core dust for 18,000 gems**\n\nLast point is that you may think you make up for the loss in gems due to the probability of getting gems via daily dispatch. On average, one successful gem dispatch is 22.475 gems \\[math is 15 gems \\* (0.7143\\*7 / 3.1456) + 20 (0.4286 / 3.1456) + 25 \\* (1.4286 / 3.1456) + 30 (0.5741 / 3.1456)\\]. That means you need at least three successful gem hits to come out ahead in gems. There is only a 21.21% of getting three successful gem dispatches out of 7 dispatches with rate of 23.4478% for gem dispatches, so 78.79% of your dispatches is a net loss of gems. So you will lose more gems than you gain over prolonged daily dispatch.",

            "Cool, thanks for these numbers. I agree with you that the introduction of the treasure dispatches kind of muddies the optimal protocol, and I'm sure there's a way to quantify the values (possibly using the expected treasure income over time to assign a specific numerical value to each kit rather than the pure exp given), but at the moment, I'm fine with just viewing the extra treasure rerolls as a slight added value above and beyond the original dispatch protocol. Where as I may have not rerolled before with only 4 or 5 dispatch slots, I may be more inclined to do so if I can also simultaneously roll for 3-4 bad treasure slots in hopes of getting better treasure upgrade materials. The extent of this willingness will depend on each person's subjective value judgement of the treasure system as a whole.",
            "I understand why you view it this way, but it just seems like we are coming at this from 2 completely different angles: You are trying to force progression by pumping the maximum amount of gems possible into X system to get Y output. I am trying to just take the best value for minimal gems/spending. I agree that trash like molds and credits probably isn't worth refreshing for and should not be taken into account in the calculation.\n\nBut your math just doesn't add up to me. You are calculating it backwards, like X % to gain back gems on 1 refresh, but you can't calculate daily refreshes that way in a vacuum.\n\nTaking into account ONLY gems + core dust:\n\n1 dispatch is worth 5.26 gems 15x0.0643 + 20x0.03 + 25x0.10 + 30x0.04. So 6 dispatches is 31.6 gems and 7 dispatches are 36.85 gems.\n\n1 dispatch is worth 0.217h of core dust 2x0.0743 + 3x0.0285. So 6 dispatches is worth 1.3h of core dust and 7 dispatches is worth 1.52h of core dust.\n\nCombining the 2 above means if you get 6 \"bad\" dispatches and reroll you expect to spend 50 gems and gain 31.6 gems and 1.3h of core dust. Spending 14.15 gems for 1 hour of core dust. For 7 you spend 50 gems and gain 36.85 gems and 1.52h of core dust. Spending 8.65 gems for 1 hour of core dust. Both of these are cheaper than wipeout.",
            "For the math on paid packs vs wipe out/hard mode farming/daily dispatch. You need to convert everything to the actual dollar amount for relative comparison (rather than using the gem-to-core-dust value from farming hard mode core dust... because none of the other methods of gaining core dust in game or via monetary packs will actually hit that excellent gems to core dust conversion rate). You can convert gem to dollar using 30-day supply value ($4.99 for 3000 gems). Pick an arbitrary value for 1h core dust for better visualization of the differences, I used 60 core dust per hour here.\n\n* For farming hard 11 for core cost (typically 900 gems for 180-1h core dust) = $1.497 spent = 7,214.43 core dust per dollar = $1.39 per 10 k core dust\n* For 1st 50 gem wipe out = $0.0831 spent = 1,442.89 core dust per dollar  => $7.49 per 10k core dust\n* For 2nd 70 gem wipe out = $0.1164 spent = 1,030.63 core dust per dollar  => $9.70 per 10k core dust\n* For 1st 50 gem daily dispatch (average rate is 44.73 gems per 1h core dust) = $0.0831 spent = 807.09 core dust per dollar => $12.39 per 10k core dust.\n* For 3rd 100 gem wipe out = $0.1163 spent = 721.44 core dust per dollar  => $13.86 per 10k core dust\n* For paid golden package 1 = $19.99 for 180 core dust + 1,500 gems is 540.27 core dust/dollar => $18.51 for 10k core dust.\n* For paid weekly core dust set = $14.99 for 90-1h core dust+1200 gems is 360.24 core dust / dollar => $24.06 to get 10k core dust.\n* For paid 30 day selector pack and using core dust = $19.99 for 120-1h core dust +1,500 gems is 360.18 core dust / dollar => $24.30 to get 10k core dust.\n* For paid monthly growth pack = $19.99 for 60-1h core dust + 1,500 gems is 180.09 core dust/dollar => $48.60 to get 10k core dust.",

My 2ndary account is even still missing OL gear on main team and saving all core dust boxes as well for next story update lol (can boost 20+ levels on that account if I open core dust boxes).\n\nmy pvp bracket has whales going down into top 30 lol. main account rank 4, 24%+ cp penalty for top 3 players, can beat their teams if not CP gapped. only 2 players in my bracket can beat my defense (with one player having CP advantage and other player insanely pvp-invested, has an expensive scarlet-x-anne-rosanna-jackal team). f2p holds diamond 1, CP gapped by whales in top 10 challenger and missing noah and biscuit and drunk scarlet and noise.

Don't need to dip into n102/belorta/mica with that roster.\n\nScarlet teams won't be using liter unless with jackal and if you are running maiden against that, it is 2RL and you are team wiped before blanc's indom. No one who actually knows what they are doing will run both blanc+liter on a scarlet-jackal team, that is not a competitive PvP team at all. a 3RL jackal team is already too slow. if the team doesn't even have jackal and is running liter+blanc+scarlet... rotfl, that is not even a pvp team... that is 4RL with clip SG, needs BOTH centi and anis to only be 3RL (aka that set-up guarentees 2nd/3rd teams autofail as used up all best burst fillers for an average 3RL team).\n\nfull clip SG + B2 defender at 2.5RL is only possible with centi since your anis is on another team.

If you are only 3RL with full clip SG with sugar as the nuke, you only kill position 5, but a lvl160 pvp teams 3RL free privaty team will stun you and win as long as their P5 is not B1 or B2. post-lvl 160, free privaty stun doesn't have enough DPS unless paired with dorothy, and that team maxes at 3RL or an uber expensive quiry stall based team. Full clip SG team is countered by jackal.\n\nA 3RL non-blanc/non-noah emilia team is extremely easy to counter.

Emilia is not a viable nuke without blanc or noah if facing competitive teams.\n\nLiterally anyone with jackal or noah and ability to make a 3RL AOE nuke wins against your defensive team setups. if you were holding your slot, your bracket is not competitive. early brackets a lot of people are missing jackal and other meta pvp units, so random teams can rank high... doesn't mean that they are competitive teams. sounds like you were winning against trash teams and now have a big head lol.\n\nlol now I remember you. you were the guy always bragging about how fast you pushed after the story nerf and all this other random wannabe flexing/bragging.\n\n...there is no 0.1 second burst gauge difference. you either burst at 2RL or 2.5RL or 3RL or slower. there isn't any inbetween bursting. there are hardbreak points that you hit with your burst gen and then you burst at the faster breakpoint. a 3RL team with 99.9 burst gen at 2.5RL bursts at the same speed as a 3RL team with 50 burst gen at 2.5RL.

(the answer is no lol). My 2nd account earned gold medals but my main account is much stronger and pushed much faster. My 2nd account is just on a dead bracket lol. It literally means nothing.\n\nlol, if you are fighting trash pvp teams... no they aren't learning pvp. beating up on 3RL pvp teams is easy.\n\nsince you are so knowledgeable about pvp, tell me what you think:\n\nwhat is the counter teams for these set-ups?\n\n* scarlet/x-anne/centi/rosanna/jackal\n* scarlet/emilia/blanc/centi/jackal\n* blanc/emilia/RH/biscuit/jackal\n* blanc/scarlet/centi/anis/jackal\n* noah/biscuit/s-anis/rapunzel/purple anis\n* noah/biscuit/rh/centi/jackal (without s-anis or emilia on the counter team)\n* noah/biscuit/emilia/centi/jackal\n\nAnd some easy questions:\n\n* what are the counter options for AOE nukes vs single target nukes vs distributed damage nukes vs s-anis nukes?\n* what is the counter options for blanc indom?\n* what is the speed difference you need to hit to avoid blanc indom, noah shield, noise hp buff, and emilia nukes?"

It's when she has one stack of her true damage buff on s1, which can only stack during full burst - typically it activates 3s into full burst but sometimes it will activate earlier and fall off faster out of full burst. It only checks shots fired during full burst. On average it should have about a 40-60% uptime with the lower end being without cooldown reduction and the higher end being with cooldown. It's also based on casters attack so *if* you have her fully overloaded she will provide *maybe* about 16% of an attackers attack.\n\nThese are very low numbers for how niche she is (buffing only laplace and frima with treasures) and you're much better off using a different b2.",

But at the end of the day, this is a gacha we are talking about, so it all comes down to luck in the end. Some guy might be a f2p just like you with the same amount of saving up and skipping and pulling and he might not have half of what you have, cause he just didn't get lucky, it's that simple. It all comes down to luck, you can save up as much as you want, but you can easily go 100+ pulls without a single SSR, while some other guys can get 15 SSRs in 100 pulls, it's all just random so there is no rule or a set example of what to do here.",
            "That's why Wish List is a more efficient form of hedging your bets. You go from a 2% chance of getting one thing you want, to a doubled chance of getting *something* you want. If someone has truly awful luck they shouldn't be rolling on banners to begin with, because they're never going to roll the final 50/50 on their 100~ rolls to get what they want, whereas with wish list rolling it will be something they want no matter what, when it does eventually happen.\n\nComparing these odds is also not fruitful because the amount of tickets you get for each of these roll types is not even remotely close. Limited tickets (and gold milage) are simply too precious to spend on a character you can eventually max out over time, **especially** when armed with the knowledge that there are going to be limited banner Nikkes coming up, and soon."
