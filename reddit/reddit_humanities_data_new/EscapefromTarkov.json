            "The fact that friendly fire in Arena is enabled before the round has started is a huge mistake. I've run into people griefing each other and shooting each other but not killing before the round has started. Huge oversight. Guns should be disabled until the start of the round. There's no reason my teammates should be able to shoot me before the fight has actually begun.",
            "I had 4 minute cooldown on scav, now it\u2019s back to 17 minutes, what happen and how to get back to those 4 min cooldowns? Rep the same 1.37.",
            "I swear the longer I play a session of Arena the worse packet loss and desync get.",
            "I tried PvE for the first time and my wait time to factory was around 8 minutes. Turned it off.",
            "Anyone know when the next patch is?",
            "Does anyone know why weapons handling and movement feels really off in Tarkov Arena compared to the main game?  I checked my sensitivity, it checks ok with my matcher but still feels a bit weird, then spray transfer and shooting while moving just seems terribly inaccurate compared to the main game.",
            "Trying to get back into Tarkov, is the game worth playing rn? As in whats the cheater situation? And is it riddled with bugs?",
            "Were post flairs reduced? I cant find the clip flair I use to shitpost",
            "What's the current state of the game? I'm interested in buying, but is it still riddled with cheaters and fully-geared vets except in the first week of the wipe?",
            "The prior patch addressed my significant stability issues (regular crashes) and getting stuck on Loading loot...entering a raid.  With the patch today all of the issues are back. I don't understand how a patch gets released that reintroduces issues that were fixed. Incredibly demoralizing.",
            "PVE, currently level 38. Are quests where you have to fight players in certain exact  areas even possible. Do players ever go into the offices of factory?  Even the bolty at less then 25m quest seems questionable.  On factory they  hide in holes in bunches, easy to kill with grenades but the bolty seems suspect.",
            "I have been thinking about buying EFT the past few days, and could use some help about this particular question I have: if I were to buy any edition other than The Unheard Edition, would the Unheard Edition be lower in price after purchasing, or would it still be retail $250 USD? (i.e. buy the Prepare for Escape edition, and then upgrade to The Unheard)",
            "Did they say when the solo hosting for pve was going to be",
            "I was wondering what the best gaming laptop would be to play tarkov? The one i have now used to be able to play it but can no longer. Im in the market for a new laptop and was wondering if any of you could help.",
            "Why are Dorms Marked room keys so damn expensive?   \nI've been seeing post after post of people getting multiple keycards and juice from these marked rooms and that's why value is going up... But after 8 runs of the room, this is literally the only notable loot I got: Black key card, docs case, dog tags case, injectors case, 2x bitcoin, and a kitted spear.   \nThis sounds good on paper, but I bought the key for $10mil like a week ago, they're even more expensive now, and this is no where close to value. Literally every time the room was full of toz's, mp-133s, kedr's, and PB's.   \nKeys are currently going for around $3mil for a 1/10. IT IS NOT WORTH IT.\n\n\\*as a note, I checked in all the book piles, on the shelves, between books etc.",
            "I just want to say I'm having a good time. Arena. PVP. PVE. I love Tarkov",
            "It was part of the boss event, which has now ended a few days ago",
            "I have noticed that, too. The more I play the more I notice how bad the game play is. It could be a really fun way to practice pvp, but the desync and packet loss completely ruins the experience for me.",
            "I\u2019ve had similar luck with factory on pve.  Any time I try running in there by myself it takes forever but with others it\u2019s a pretty quick timer.  I have elected to just stop going there unless I have a quest because it takes so long for me compared to other maps.",
            "Are you wearing the same armor/helmet/backpack?\n\nAll of those will mess with your sensitivity, turn rate, ergo, and move speed.",
            "Same questions with Arena as I have that too",
            "Yes, so that people could filter between pvp and pve posts.",
            "Gameplay wise the games in the best state it\u2019s been in\n\nCheaters are still a problem but that\u2019s every FPS( don\u2019t listen to the people here it\u2019s not worse than other games lol ). \n\nThey are kinda adding P2W stuff which is a huge red flag for the future( I\u2019m sure you saw the whole unheard thing ), amongst other issues the devs have created for themselves. \n\nIdk if I would buy it rn; maybe wait until it wipes and check back in.",
            "Current state is pretty bad. Game is still infested with cheaters, the average player only plays for like the first 2 months of a wipe and then yeah it's mostly only the die-hards left playing. Server stability is dogshit. Old game breaking bugs remain unpatched.\n\nRecoil is in a good place though.",
            "dont buy it, it's worth day after day, years after years...  \nWanna play pvp ! nice it's infected by cheater and ridiculous bug. some of them are here from like 3 years ! (no kidding).  \nWanna play pve ! nice, you will enjoy 25min loading game and disconnected by server after 25 min ! Some day, if you lucky you can have x2 20min round after 2 hours.  \nOh and i forgot, wanna patch 22mo ? For what ??? server are dying and you cant play your 200$ game.  \nBut something is nice : enjoy free youtube mini film. For what ? dunno. I guess BSG is dying and Nikita try to make hollywood movie or prepare a netflix serie...",
            "Since last patch yesterday the loading times have gone up by multiple full minutes... Matching... for 8 minutes almost every single raid I try to join. And this is the main game I'm talking about, what happened in yesterdays patch ffs?",
            "Yeah, currently level 64 in pve with lightkeeper, sometimes they will spawn inside of it already but if not if you don't kill the AI PMC they will eventually activate and actually start running around a bit and usually when they do they will go to the office or near it, if they go near it just go inside the office and peek out and shoot one and run inside they will probably push you. For the bolt action 25m I would recommend dorms on customs or interchange, goshan i think it's called the food store they typically spawn near the tents, and they spawn between brutal/kiba and general middle of the aisle by the boxes right up from the hole, though Killa can also be in those two spots or nearby xD. Shoreline health resort is a good place to do it also, they can spawn outside west or east wing, sometimes inside east or the back of east by the firetruck/wall also sometimes right in the middle past the ambulance between all the glass hallways, can go inside resort and shoot them.\n\nEdit: NGL tired after getting home from work forgot 25m kills can literally be done on factory xD put a red dot on one if you aren't good enough with iron sights since they're 1x shouldn't really hurt your performance.",
            "Your current price of the Unheard edition is the price of the base game + upgrades. If you were to buy the base game, that price would get deducted off the price you see right now, because it would become only the upgrade price.\n\n  \nWhat I did, is I bought the base game to see if I was enjoying it, and when I did, I started slowly upgrading from edition to edition, until I reached the highest edition. I didn't pay extra, I paid the same total amount as if I were to upgrade it to the max in 1 go. Hope this helps.",
            "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I loved being a scav rat it was great",
            "That makes sense and it's not actual sensitivity. What's happening is that after the first bullet or two the camera recoil goes off in some random directly like my feet. I just got out of a round where the camera bounced my gun and sight into the center of the upper left quadrant of my screen so I could still see it, but it's obviously a dogshit view staring at the ground 3 feet to my right. I can't recall seeing anything like this in the main game.",
            "Yeah that seems the best way to do it then, thanks!",
            "mans malding, its the best shooter on the market and if you get stuck into it Nothing else will come close. The bugs are worth it.",
            "what an excellent reply! I am red dotting a modded m700 and trying on interchange cause I noted they were often close there. Thanks for the info.",
            "It does, thank you!"

Credit where credit is due, the last two have been some of the most fun ones I've had in my 6+ years of playing. I'd just like to have them be more frequent, especially when there is not much time left in the wipe and the game would benefit from people being drawn back in woth some cool stuff happening.",
