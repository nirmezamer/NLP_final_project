Bananas could also be a great option for you! If you can, download an app like \u201cMy Fitness Pal\u201d to input your planned meals/snacks and you can see if you are fulfilling your nutritional requirements through that (has a screen that shows the amount of protein, carbs, vitamins, etc.). You could also get some powdered electrolytes to put in your water. This might encourage you to drink more if you like the taste as well. Some others have suggested small milk cartons - I\u2019d recommend getting whole milk rather than skim or 2%. It adds more healthy fats to your diet. Also, there\u2019s the \u201cavocado toast\u201d is expensive trope, but it\u2019s honestly quite good for you and buying whole fruits/veggies can be pretty cost effective. When you select avocados, get some in different stages of ripeness (if they are very firm, they aren\u2019t ready yet\u2026 if they are very squishy then they are too far gone and won\u2019t be great to eat). This way, they will ripen on different days rather than all at the same time. Mashed avocado on whole grain bread with mustard and everything bagel seasoning is delicious and filling. You don\u2019t have to toast the bread, but it is nice that way. If you have refrigeration available, you can also top the avocado toast with hard boiled eggs for added protein. Pre-cooked hardboiled eggs are a little pricier than uncooked eggs but they might be worth the splurge in this scenario.",

They both help restaurants and grocery stores avoid food waste and get you deals, but like being able to grab a less expensive stuff. Sometimes I can snag some extra ripe fruit and a close to expectation single serve yogurt for dirt cheap from Flashfood. \n\nIf you have room for a big Tupperware bowl, you can dump those pre bagged salad kits in one and just shake the hell out of it to combine.

            "I have two omnivores and a vegetarian, and often we'll make a meal and two proteins (chicken and soy chicken, chicken and chickpeas, beef and blackbeans) to make it work. \n\nYou can make a pot of chili  or pasta sauce, and add meat to half, as well, or a curry and add meat to half (beans for the other half in both cases, or veggie 'beef' if you like that). You can do a stir fry and remove half, and then add the cooked meat (edamame or tofu for the veg half).    Happily the veg fake meats don't need to be cooked, so they are really quick to sub in.  \n\nWhen kiddo went veg, I bought two identical skillets, a green paddle and a red paddle, and a green and red spatula  (she's not fussy about cross contamination but I like to keep things separate). Meat things cook on the left of my stove, using the red utensils and veg things on the right using the green.  I haven't mixed it up yet.  Lots of meals are the exact same but for the different protein. \n\nPizza is easy to split for two preferences, as are omelettes, pastas (meatballs and \"meat\"balls).   Anything with meatballs actually, sub \"meat\"balls for kid's portion.   Tacos, baked potato bar, and other 'self assembly' meals are great as well, everyone can choose their own toppings. \n\nBurgers, two skillets (bean burgers cook faster and on a lower temp than meat).  Everything else is identical - buns toppings condiments etc. \n\nAnd of course the non veggies can enjoy veg meals - we only have meat twice a week or less, and enjoy hearty veg meals with our kid, the rest of the time.  \n\nSome favourites: \n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegetarian-french-dip-sandwiches/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegetarian-french-dip-sandwiches/)\n\n[https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-and-quinoa-enchilada-bake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-and-quinoa-enchilada-bake/) or [https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/green-chile-enchilada-quinoa-bake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/green-chile-enchilada-quinoa-bake/) \n\n[https://www.marthastewart.com/1535235/vegetarian-shepherds-pie](https://www.marthastewart.com/1535235/vegetarian-shepherds-pie)\n\n[https://tasty.co/recipe/southwestern-veggie-packed-tater-tot-casserole](https://tasty.co/recipe/southwestern-veggie-packed-tater-tot-casserole)\n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/black-bean-burgers/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/black-bean-burgers/)\n\nMake the Budget Bytes' taco rice and easy black beans, and add cilantro rice chicken for your meat eater.

Veggie burgers, vegan hot dogs taste almost the same as meat ones. \n\nTacos or fajitas are easy to make both vegetarian and not, just keep the meat separate.",
            "I\u2019m a big fan of thai curry. It is very easy to make and you can add whatever protein you want to it.  I have really enjoyed the recipe with both chicken and chickpeas. There are tons of recipes out there, but it basically boils dow to: stir fry whatever veggies+protein you want, add some coconut milk and curry paste, enjoy as-is or over rice. \n\nAlso burritos/burrito bowls are a super tasty and low-effort way to combine leftovers. Similar idea, just lots of veggies, spices, and your choice of protein. I usually do a bowl of sweet potatoes, diced onions, (frozen) corn, lime juice, cilantro, black beans, and either tofu crumbles or chicken.",
            "One of my favorite comfort foods is a bowl of mashed potatoes with a spinach gratin and mushroom gravy.\u00a0 If I am being lazy, I will modify it to a colcanon.\u00a0 I usually pan sear some chicken thighs or cod filets as well for those that want meat with their meal.\n\n\nAnother one we do is a spring vegetable pasta. So lots of mushroom, artichoke, spinach, peas, and carrots and served in a broth reduction with tortelini.\u00a0 Anyone who wants meat I usually offer ham with it.\u00a0 This one serves like a stew depending on how much broth you want to cook down.\u00a0 Using risotto instead of tortelini is also delicious. And pretty quick and easy.\n\n\nMy daughter loves stuffed sweet potatoes, usually with black beans, corn and salsa.\n\n\nStir fry is great. And you can prep the rice in bulk in advance to make is more convenient.\u00a0 Bonus precooked rice that isstored in the fridge becomes a resistant starch vs a simple starch.\n\n\nYou could always follow up with a fried rice or pilaf another night.\n\n\nThis one isn't exactly convenient in terms of effort.\u00a0 But I LOVE spaetzle with sauteed mushrooms and cheese.\u00a0 Some roasted green beans or asparagus on the side and it will fill you up.",

It comes out like the texture of an Indian Curry, but different flavor (no Turmeric, Curry Powder, Garam Masala, etc). Great over rice can make it even healthier by tossing in some Kale (after pressure cooking). Really satisfying and great flavor too.

            "Here are a few:\n\nChilli - tomato, beans, mushrooms, onions, and spices (add beef to the non-veg bowls)\n\nCurry 1 - fry onions, add chickpeas, spinach, and a can of tomatoes, then all the curry spices or a curry paste of your choice. (You can add chopped chicken to this if you want to add meat)\n\nCurry 2 - Fry onions, add cooked lentils of choice (you can blend some of them for a creamier texture), tomato sauce, cream, curry spices or paste, and then any veggies you want to add (for meat, add whichever meat you prefer to the curry in your own bowl)\n\nRicebowls - simply set out a variety of ingredients and pick and choose what you want to put on top. For vegetarian options, I would use beans, eggs, or tofu for the protein, and for meat eaters, you can choose whichever animal you want to eat most. Other toppings can include avocado, cucumber, broccoli, carrot, fried cabbage, coconut flakes, sesame seeds, cilantro, corn, and tomato, (though you can really choose anything to top this) and then add a dressing of some sort. \n\nBacon and eggs/bbq tofu and eggs - easy enough. Fry eggs, fry bacon, serve. Or for veg, Fry thin sliced firm tofu, add bbq sauce, pair with fried eggs, serve. \n\nGrilled cheese and tomato soup - good for anyone, doesn't need any alterations\n\nShepards pie - you can do a vegetarian version with lentils cooked in veggie stock in place of the meat, and you can do two mini ones in either small tins or small ramekins - one for you, one for her. \n\nRiceballs/onigiri - you can fill them with different things. I like a salmon filled one, but there are many different options for what you can put inside them.",
            "You can make a ton of recipes work for both if you just modify things a bit. Many times you'll find that you can cook the meat separately and add it at the end. You might lose a bit of the flavor that would come from cooking it together or from not browning the meat first to get the fond, but at the end of the day as long as the meat is cooked at the end-result tastes good, that's all that matters. As long as it doesn't need to be stewed or baked you can spin off most anything. \n\nSome super simple things that I love making that can also be made with both veg and meat in mind:\n\nZataran's Black/Red Beans and Rice. Just cook up a chicken thigh or some sausage of some kind (andouille is great, kielbasa, polish/spicy itallian work too) while it simmers, add to your daughters portion at the end. Add diced bell pepper and onion for a bit more veg and flavor.  \n\nA personal favorite that is both simple and cheap is just potatoes, onions, garlic, mushrooms and spinach with either chicken thighs or steak for the protein. Basically just dice the potatoes and onion, mince the garlic and fry them all up in a large skillet until the potatoes are brown. Turn the heat off and toss the spinach in until it begins to wilt, then plate. A trick to make the potatoes not take forever to cook is to microwave them covered with a paper towel for ~60-90 seconds before frying. You can either quickly cook the meat afterwards in the same pan for some extra flavor, or you can cook it alongside while you're frying everything. \n\nSalads can have meat added really easily, or boiled eggs\n\nSoups can also work. You do lose some flavor from not cooking the meat with everything else, but you can compensate with well-seasoned meat cooked separately. A personal favorite is to cook a chicken thigh (there's a pattern here) while I boil the water for ramen. Dice it up and add it at the end, along with anything else I happen to have on-hand like carrots, green onion, etc. \n\nIn fact most pasta works. When I was a kid my sister went vegetarian and it changed basically nothing about spaghetti night. She just got hers plated a few minutes early. If you eat cheese then Mac & Cheese is great too. While the water boils just brown some ground beef or quickly fry up some sliced hot dogs or other sausage. Or chicken thighs. After plating your portion, mix in the meat for your daughter. \n\nThis ended up being an essay, but I hope it helps you out a bit.",
