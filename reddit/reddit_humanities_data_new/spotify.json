            "I just wish they'd remove this useless smart shuffle so I can shuffle my playlists in peace again",
            "i'm a very organized person but spotify is not and it annoys me so much\n\nwhy are there identical versions of the same album created all the time? (i'm not talking about clean/unclean versions or deluxes). i hate going through artists pages and seeing i don't have their albums saved, when i really do but it's just another identical version that magically appeared on their profile. or looking at playlists and seeing that songs i do have saved don't appear with a like because it's a different version. PLEASE SPOTIFY is it really that hard to just not duplicate the same versions of songs and albums? or to recognize that it's the same product?",
            "Bro get the like button back on desktop. wtf is that shit... in a playlist, i have to hover on a song, click on the checkmark, scroll to find the Liked song \"playlist\", click on the check mark, then click done??? come on\n\nThe new the add to playlist when i can see everywhere the song is added is nice tho, just get the heart button back (maybe add another button for add to playlist)\n\nAlso, i'm still mad you combined the song and artist column years ago...",
            "This new layout is the absolute WORST incarnation that Spotify has ever put out. It is unbelievable that they would remove functionality like this.\n\nWhy the FUCK can i no longer view the songs/albums/artists in my library at the same time as viewing a list of my playlists????\n\nI can't drag and drop albums onto a playlist anymore without manually searching the album name? and it's not searching my library it's searching the overall spotify collection which means it's going to include songs i exluded from my library.\n\nWHO DESIGNED THIS??????????????????\n\nThey've actually lost me as a customer now. I've been paying for premium for 13 years. FUCK YOU SPOTIFY.",
            "I just want to say that all of Spotify\u2019s UI devs should be fired and just don\u2019t hire any more. You people are idiots who keep pushing out useless UI changes that nobody wants nor asked for that never fail worsen the experience each time. The existence of your jobs is to keep pushing out garbage UI updates. Just leave it as is so it doesn\u2019t get any worse holy fuck",
            "I'm annoyed that clicking the album art (bottom-left on desktop) no longer takes me to the song in the playlist. This was very useful in long playlists. Now I have to scroll through potentially hundreds of songs.\n\nThere are TWO buttons to open the Now Playing panel (the album art, and the button next to the lyrics button), but NO button to take me to the song in the playlist. \n\nIt also no longer takes me back to the playlist if I've navigated away from that page. This was useful to quickly get back to the playlist. Navigating back to the playlist now requires multiple clicks, instead of the single-click it was previously.",
            "im so mad with this new desktop UI oh my god... everyday it gets WORSE! months ago i already accepted the fact that accesing my saved albums list is now a pain in the ass, since for whatever reason its now located in the same left section of the screen i used to check my playlists, fine. later i accepted the fact that the album artwork is now in the same right section i used to check the \"friends are listening to\" tab and i can't see them at the same time anymore, whatever. but now you're telling me THE DAMN QUEUE IS ALSO GETTING MOVED?? WHAT THE FUCK!! the middle section (which is supposed to be the main section) is a waste of space now since it has become useless, it was the perfect place to check my queue and albums and now they just shoved every useful menu in two tiny sections in my screen that already had their respective functions, not to mention the fact that when you make them bigger it looks completely awful. i'm downloading an older version of the app, i'm not doing this shit anymore lol",
            "How do I stop Spotify from playing liked songs playlist automatically in the car? As soon as I start the car and phone connects to my car via Bluetooth it plays the first song in my liked playlist, even when I had another song \u201cpre loaded\u201d from last time I used Spotify. It\u2019s super annoying. Tried to google the answer but it only gives me the answers relating to auto play similar songs which is not what I\u2019m after.\n\nEdit : I\u2019m on an iPhone up to date version of Spotify",
            "Yup bring back the like/heart button. It was so much better for tracking songs, marking/tagging them etc. Binary yes/no. The new auto hiding playlist button is a lot worse.\n\nI would use the heart button to track how far down I had listened in a playlist. Songs I wanted to go back to etc. It was very good just as a visible tag, now there is no way to mark/categorize/comment/tag a song. Very sad.",
            "How the fuck do these fucking updates keep getting past QA at Spotify. Do they not have any form of QA at all? My queue is now at the far side of the window in a much smaller pane where I can't even press the delete button to delete songs from the queue. Literally for what reason is there to make this update? It makes my user experience worse and serves literally no benefit to me. Fucking unbelievable how they keep making the shittest UX changes known to man for seemingly absolutely no reason. \n\nLast time they removed the ability to have the art of the song be larger by adding the terrible now playing pane on the right. Now I can't even have that open if I'm in my queue. What is the point.\n\nJust have it so that when you access the lyrics of a song *and* the queue, the queue moves to the sidepane. Until then, let it stay as it was. Pointless and shit update.\n\nEven down to the basic stuff. Why is the order of buttons Now playing (1), lyrics (2), queue (3), when (1) and (3) affect the sidebar but (2) affects the main window. Put the shit that effect the same area of the screen next to each other. \n\nWho the hell is being paid to make this UX vomit",
            "Why the fuck is the queue now this shitty little menu to the right? Now I can't see/manage my queue while I have now playing on the right. Another braindead UI update",
            "My Spotify wrapped is full of songs I\u2019ve never even heard of? There are a lot that I have listened too. But around 40% I\u2019ve never seen before in my life. Any ideas?",

            "There\u2019s just no easy way to tell what songs I\u2019ve liked or not and it\u2019s so frustrating. Please fix this Spotify, it\u2019s the worst decision made since I\u2019ve started using the service 5 years ago. I don\u2019t need to know which songs I\u2019ve added to any playlist I\u2019ve ever made, just the songs I\u2019ve liked. Please. I\u2019m sure everyone agrees with me on this.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen a lot of people echoing the sentiment but I\u2019ll refrain from deleting this to show how in consensus we are",
            "Constant crash on launch with the latest beta on Android. Any fix?\n\nTried wiping cache and storage, uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted, nada. Old APKs aren't available because Spotify sucks and DMCAs them, so can't test multiple versions to isolate the issue.",
            "Every single one of my playlists has had a random song moved to the start of the playlist. I mostly make playlists of albums so this is very annoying. Any idea what could cause thus?",
            "[deleted]",
            "Why would I use this for complaints and feature request? It's a 3 month old megathread where new comments get buried... Perhaps that's the point though...",
            "Desktop app just updated and OOOOOOOOO it\u2019s pissing me off BAD. The queue moved to the right-hand side where friends activity is, which wouldn\u2019t be an issue except when you close the queue it ALSO closes the friends activity. WHY",
            "Please stop forcing a UI change every few months. Why cant I move the current playlist to the middle like it used to be, why are you forcing it to the side where the band info usually appears? I just dont understand why you keep making this app less user friendly with every update?!",
            "\\>I want access to choose my own songs and create playlists, but I won\u2019t pay for premium\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm paying for premium, so why can't I listen to my computer files on my phone?",
            "Is anyone having issues with Spotify right now? I'm on a pixel 7 and Spotify is opening, but then a black overlay hits the app and I can't do anything. I've forced stop the app and restarted my phone. Any ideas?",
            "Has anyone figured out how to share a personalized Spotify wrapped story link? I\u2019d like to share my whole Spotify wrapped story and see my friends but every link only shows an image of one of the stats and then uses a dynamic link that goes to the wrapped story for whoever clicks it. Do I really just have to screen record to share the whole thing?",
            "Worst app ever on android. Yikes",
            "Has anyone managed to get Local Files to actually work? I have a few albums and songs I've tried to add so many times but they break constantly, randomly getting removed, not playing, album art dissapearing, tracks doubling.",
            "I'm so genuinely upset with this app. Particularly the smart shuffle, i never use it because it works so poorly but now it randomly pops on and refuses to turn off. However the worse change is the stupid + button now doesn't let you add songs to playlists or liked songs if youre offline??? Wtf. You cannot make playlists or remove songs from playlists unless your are connected to the Internet. Also how the heck am I supposed to see what songs are in my liked playlist at a glance when looking through playlists..",
            "Is there a way to roll back all those horrible updates and get back a version of Spotify that has hearts and is capable of jumping to current spot in the playlist?   \nWith the way the updates progressively make user experience worse, I'm scared to think what features they will remove next.",
            "Okay. I spend $70 on Car Thing expecting my product to work and you\u2019re just going to discontinue its operating capabilities? That\u2019s unfair to such a high degree. I pay for the service monthly and I paid for your product. What the hell.",
            "How about you continue to support the PRODUCT YOU MADE. \n\nCar Thing deserved better.",
            "Some of my local files are deleting off my phone and when I redownload them, they delete again. I saw somewhere that it might be because of certain symbols in the file, but the post I saw that on was from 6 years ago and its never happened until now. I've had the files for almost a year now and they are just starting to do it. Does anyone know how to fix it?",
            "Anyone else having trouble with spotify pausing your music every few seconds?",
            "Anyone else\u2019s iOS app keep crashing randomly in the middle of songs? I\u2019m updated on the latest iOS version, and as far as I know the app is as well. Been happening for a week or two for me",
            "Why make CarThing non functioning when it\u2019s perfectly fine. Wtf",
            "I can't play downloaded songs. I'm on Android on Pixel 6. I can play the same song through the search function. I can play non downloaded playlists. Just not downloaded songs.\n\nTried forcing the app to stop, clearing cache, restarting, reinstalling... Nothing.\n\nI made a long post on their support website, posted, but got a random error and lost the post...\n\nReally disappointed with this BS.",
            "When I click on play radio and it creates a playlist for my user it doesn\u2019t include anything new or by people I\u2019ve never heard or played. \nHow do I create a playlist of new material based on a song or album I like? Thanks",
            "My Spotify puts songs on repeat as a default setting - anyone know why this happens and how to stop it?\n\nHas been happening for ages and only on the iOS version.  I bought a cheap android when my phone broke but needed one for work and when I was using that I noticed it didn\u2019t do it. \n\nI\u2019ve looked in my settings for anything obvious but can\u2019t find anything\u2026 anyone have any ideas?",
            "i updated my spotify app and now the layout keeps glitching in ways that it definitely didn't before the update",
            "My spotify wrapped is all messed up because my husband plays sea shanties on our alexa echo dot and it streams them from my spotify? Is there a way to make alexa connect to his spotify instead? We have a spotify family premium account and only 1 Amazon account. Thx",
            "How do you make it so spotify is giving you new music without me having to search specifically for it myself? \n\nHow do I make shuffle, like, SHUFFLE?",
            "The most recent app update for IOS is killing my phones battery, the app constantly crashes, and load times are horrible. Before (while phone is in airplane mode), I would listen to podcasts for about 9 hours a day at work and leave work with about 40% battery left on my phone. Now my phone only makes it about 4 hours in to the work day and its at 20% battery, while the app crashes and takes forever to load ANYTHING even offline downloaded stuff.\n\nSuch a shit fucking app, I didnt think it could get worse.",
            "The changes to liking songs is awful and makes the whole experience slower.",
            "Whatever I'm listening to will abruptly switch to a random song in my general liked songs library whenever I switch *how* I'm listening. For example, I was just in my sister's car and had my phone plugged into the aux. We were listening to a specific playlist and when she dropped me off at my car, my phone connected to the Bluetooth and the playlist suddenly switched to a random song in my liked songs. Despite picking a random song, shuffle will be turned off too. Sometimes it will happen as a song is playing too, as if it took a few seconds to remember \"oh yeah, I'm supposed to do this completely annoying and unnecessary thing for no reason!\" fwiw, I listen on iOS.\n\nI've also had it happen when I stop listening on my AirPods for a while and then start again hours later.\n\nHas anyone else been dealing with this? If so did you find a way to fix it?",
            "The biggest issue with the like button is that it removes the entire point of having a liked songs in which you can instantly add or remove songs you  like to a congregate, After 2k songs,  and a weak shuffle function there will be songs you constantly lose track of and simply want to cycle back to the top. playlists are curated, Not organized.  I'm not adding a song to a playlist after 1 listen, some music has poor replay value. \n\nAnd smart shuffle is cool but it's so poorly designed that it gets in the way of typical  toggling of regular shuffle.\n\nBoth of these issues could be fixed by a long press/hold feature.  And  would streamline the experience, for new users,  and experienced listeners.  but I didn't think it took a genius to understand this.",
            "I haven't been getting the lyrics to most songs i've listened to since around september/october. I'm on the windows app, it'll show me the mic button but it'll say \"we don't know the lyrics for this one\" even if the lyrics are on musixmatch. I've tried clearing cache, logging off and on, uninstalling and reinstalling. Any reason or does spotify just hate me?",
            "Every single song has \u201ccouldn\u2019t load lyrics\u201d and it\u2019s so annoying",
            "Can you please make the default indicator in a playlist whether the song is liked or not, not whether its somewhere in ur libary of potentially a hundred playlists, again.  \nIs there perhaps some 3rd party client than does this ?",
            "I'm confused right now. If I like a song, why does it add it to my most recent playlist? I want it in Liked Songs, not that playlist. I don't want to add a black metal song to my 2000s Songs playlist just because I liked it. What the hell is this BS?",
            "Is there a way to add multiples of same song now? I cant seen to do it :(",
            "Make smart-shuffle hold to turn on. I often go from shuffle to not shuffle on the phone and often without good service it gets stuck trying to load smart shuffle",
            "Does anyone know a fix for local files becoming grayed out on mobile? My playlist had files from my computer and they all worked just fine yesterday.  Then when I went to leave for work this morning every single local file song was unavailable despite  having worked just fine for months before and even when i manage to get them to download again to my phone, like an hour or so later they'll all gray out again and its super annoying and nothing I've found online has fixed it.",
            "Can anyone direct me to a way to chat with spotify support? I lost access to my premium account because i cant access my facebook anymore and honestly im a couple of days from just cancelling and uploading my playlists while i still have desktop access...",
            "For the love of God just remove ambient noises from taste profiles and recommended playlists. Just don't make them appear ever!! No one wants a discover weekly or daylist of brown noise just because they listened to it while sleeping a few times. Ffs.",
            "For unknown reasons spotify decided to change the sequence of songs in my playlists. Not just one, but all of my created playlists.\n\nI really hate this. I know I mostly listen to them in shuffle or starting from the middle. But I don't like other party messing around with my playlists.\n\nI don't think that I shared them that made editing possible.\n\nThis and ads on spotify exclusive podcast are beginning to make me considering switching.",
            "Spotify app is crashing on my fire tablet (the one I use the least so that's why Spotify is on there) super frustrating. It's not just me though cus my friend's granddaughter has the same issue on her fire tablet",

            "A few weeks ago, the app started acting up, I\u2019ll listen to something for a little bit and then all of a sudden the app just turns off, and I have to click on the icon again to get back in and start with you so again, sometimes from where I left off or in the very beginning of the song. It happens repeatedly I don\u2019t know why. Sometimes it might be because I have two different Bluetooth items on the same time but I\u2019ll turn one off and send you a podcast and it\u2019ll stay on for a while and then sometimes it keeps going on and off repeatedly anyone have the same issue what the hell do you do. I\u2019m also using an iPhone.",
            "Is anyone else having issues with Spotify not playing the next song in your queue/playlist after the current one is over? It's so annoying having to manually go into the list and choose the next song myself, especially when I'm trying to do something else while Spotify plays in the background.",
            "Edit: I rolled back to an older version (the Jan 24th update) and everything works as it should. Something about the Feb. 1st update broke something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have some High Quality Rips that I like to listen to in between new artists I find on tiktok, friends, etc.\n\nNow my rips will NOT stay downloaded on my android app. I assume because I get them all from Youtube (cuz they're remixes), Spotify doesn't see them as legit and doesn't want to sync them to my phone anymore.\n\nJust SUDDENLY this was an issue on the 1st of the month. So needless to say, I'm quite annoyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Also, the smart shuffle unloads all Local Files, so when I shuffle and suddenly don't I just click the shuffle button and it goes to smart shuffle first, unloading my local files. this is such a pain.)",
            "Is there any way to customize the home screen? I've got zero interest in Episodes for you, Editor's Picks or Popular Radio. And on that note, is it possible to have a \"region-agnostic\" profile? I don't care about this region's local artists - I hear enough of them on the radio!",

Sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought it was maybe just a problem with my desktop app so I switched to the web browser. The web browser isn't giving me any issues when pausing or skipping tracks but it has a whole other set of glitches, yay. It's very laggy when trying to add songs to a playlist or the queue and when searching. \n\nI don't know if something's been going down at the Spotify headquarters like they just layed off a bunch of employees or if people have been quitting en masse so everything's breaking because It's never been this glitchy before.",

I have absolutely no idea why it keeps telling about their new release as I haven't listened to their music at all. I do not care for them and it's deeply aggravating that their shit keeps being recommended.\n\nI've clicked the \"do not recommend artist\" button on their profile but that appears to have done nothing.\n\nAm I going crazy?

I don't believe Tidal has a free plan yet, but if you already pay for Spotify, you can switch to Tidal, pay the same price per month as Spotify, and get music quality that is WAY higher than Spotify, as Tidal doesn't compress the crap out of their audio like Spotify does. Not to mention Tidal carries more music than Spotify, AND they pay their artists almost 4x as much as Spotify, which means you switching does way more to financially support the artists you listen to.   \n  \nThere are also third party websites that will automatically switch over your entire music library from one platform to another, including playlists you created.",

Before the algorithm puts a song in the queue, it makes sure it hasn't played in the last 10% of the playlist. So if there are 100 songs in a playlist, you shouldn't hear the same song twice until 10 other songs have played. \n\nThis could also be an option.

You can shuffle play the song itself but you waste like all your skips just getting to it usually, so if you want to listen to several specific songs you're screwed. And that's fine, whatever. I use Spotify for longer, more random sessions of listening to music, just letting the algorithm pick what it wants from my massive liked songs playlist, and I know the algorithm is rigged or whatever but I think it works well enough for me to enjoy it.\n\nBut so if playing single songs on Spotify free is unviable and it's much better to listen to shuffled playlists, why the hell with certain specific songs does it start playing them from some random playlist? Please tell me there's some setting to turn this off because it's fucking annoying. It's always popular and/or new songs, but with songs I'm not super familiar with the context of, it's basically a gamble as to whether it will happen or not. But anyway, when I search and click on a song, it's so I can add it to a playlist, not because I want to listen to it in that exact moment shuffled with potentially other songs I've never heard of.\n\nIt's so annoying because I'm always in the middle of listening to a playlist, either paused or actively playing, and it overrides that and makes me have to go back to my playlist, hit play again, and if I wasn't actively listening and just had the playlist paused, I now have to either pause the playlist as soon as it starts since you can't rewind or fast forward at all without Premium (which is very difficult), live with it being paused a second into the song (which is sometimes inconsequential but other times the song just starts immediately), or just listen to the song to be able to pause at the start of the next one.\n\nI've flipped all the logical settings I could think of, tried getting Premium and letting it expire, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app (even though I knew that wouldn't do anything), and nothing worked. I know I've fixed this before in the past but I have no idea how since I've already tried all the things I thought I could have done.

This sorting is by the date you added it. If you sort by Artist however this sorting is alphabetical by Artist and if you like more than one song from an artist, it is then further sorted alphabetically by the title of the song. Take Eminem for example, Say you like Phenomenal, Rap God, and Lose Yourself. Well, the liked songs playlist sorted by artist will sort it this way: Lose Yourself, Phenomenal, Rap God. I love this, its so nice.\n\nNow in a playlist you create this is very different. The default sorting is custom, which allows you to sort it however you want. However if you try to sort it by Artist like in the Liked Songs playlist, this is where it irks me something fierce. It sorts by Artist just fine. The trouble is multiple songs from that same artist. Any playlist you create and sort by Artist will go Artist and then Title of Album the song is from.

My playlist is downloaded and has \\~800 songs in it.\n\n  \nBecause shuffle sucks I turned it off. When playback resumes in the car, it'll finish the one song it was paused during, then randomly jump to some other song in the playlist instead of going to the next song on the playlist, after that it'll do another.

Connect the USB cable. Spotify should work normally\n6. Turn Bluetooth back on\n\nThis works for me on vehicles with Apple CarPlay as well as on basic aftermarket head units. It seems like when Spotify has auto-connected through Bluetooth, then gets a USB connection, it has problems shifting everything over to USB. The skip track button advances the title but doesn't play it, hitting play has no effect, and the display on the phone appears to be playing (the mock peak meter animation next to the track name appears).",
            "Yeah why the hell is simply liking a song like a three step process now? Why did they think that was a good idea? Absolutely baffling decision",
            "Absolute nonsense I can no longer click once to add a song to my liked playlist. Plus there's no way for me to know on playlists like Discover Weekly if I've already added the song to my likes.",
            "There is no \"liked songs\" anymore. Let me explain. I have a few playlists of \"stuff I want to hear later\" Now every single one of those songs shows up as check marked. Also I have collaborative playlists from friends and from a music Discord channel I'm in. I don't necessarily have every song liked in those lists.\n\nSo now I can't tell if a song is liked or in one of those other playlists, at least on phone. On desktop the songs still show as a heart.\n\nAlso, when I check mark a song on my phone it puts it in whatever the last playlist I added a song to. So if I liked a song but also added it to my Cover Song folder, then next song I click + will add it to my Covers Folder, not my liked songs.\n\nDoes anyone at Spotify actually USE Spotify?",
            "This is the exact complaint that I came here to make. I love the idea of an \"add to playlist\" button, but why does it have to replace the like button when there's enough space for both",
            "Since this update, I appear to have lost all my followed playlists as well. All the ones from my wife, my friends' mixes, even the yearly Spotify Top Songs playlist are all gone from my playlist folders. It's a huge bummer. Spotify appears to have forgotten that its core demo is music fans, first and foremost. The DJ sucks, the shuffling sucks, the Discover Weekly is filled with lowest-common-denom bedroom acts that paid for the privilege. It's the Amazonification of everything. Democratized slop and a horrible time using the thing. I honestly wish there were a cheaper subscription that just gives you access to the music library and the ability to make playlists. I don't need the cutesy bs. I'm sitting in my crappy car listening to my ancient iPod video on the auxiliary cord, and it finally feels right. I hate how the march of progress in app development always means entropically approaching clusterfuck design decisions by product managers who have no basic empathic understanding of how human beings wish to interface with software. I imagine that any notion of the aesthetic appreciation of music goes out the window.",
            "Right when they finally got rid of the terrible enhanced shuffle button they switch up the liked button to be the enhanced shuffle equivalent of adding songs. Why spotify? Why?",
            "I'm getting flash backs from when the pulled \"starred\" and I sat looking at a \"liked songs\" list with one track in it. They didn't even assume your \"starred\" should be ported to your \"liked\"!!",
            "Seriously. What are they thinking with this. And to make matters worse, albums you\u2019ve liked in the past now do not show up in your liked songs.",
            "They are seriously taking the piss. They get too much money. The app was perfect some years ago, but they got to keep fucking it up.\n\nWhy is it a must to put a track into \"liked\" list if you want to put it into a playlist. Who thought that's a good idea?\n\nNo \"don't recommend me that\" button. I keep getting an annoying track playing constantly.",
            "You can literally just turn it off....",
            "This is one of my biggest pet peeves too, especially when it's a more recent album. I saved Ethel Cain's album to my library last summer and now whenever I search for it, an identical version that I *haven't* saved appears.",
            "I'm a big george harrison fan and it seems that they keep releasing new versions of \"All Things Must Pass\". I've got like 5 versions of each song now",
            "Tbf, this is likely on a publisher/record label level rather than a Spotify issue. If there are 3 different versions cause maybe slight differences in songs or different labels maybe have rights to publish certain songs and stuff. Also regions can affect it too. It\u2019s all confusing and annoying music business stuff but likely not Spotify\u2019s issue (for once)",
            "i agree with the core sentiment in this. they kept making the ui worse every year.",
            "amen brother",
            "Yes! This is super annoying. Please let me know if you find another way to get to the currently playing song in a playlist.",
            "This change drives me nuts. I create and listen to very large playlists and clicking the album art to navigate to the currently playing song is a vital feature for me. I've literally avoided switching to other services because of \"little\" features like this. Really hoping they change it back.",
            "yeah wtf why is the queued shoved in the corner and now it doesn't show the times of the songs or their albums asdk;jfas;dkfjas;lkjwe im MAD",
            "Seriously, why did they change the que thing. Hitting \"delete\" doesn't even delete songs from the que unless I highlight more than 1 now. Straight up worse in multiple ways....",
            "I\u2019ve been looking for this too. Even if I just stop using the app and keep it running in the background, minutes later when I open it in my car it plays the same song from my liked playlist. Never used to have this issue. Super annoying is right",
            "I'm having this issue too and it's making me so mad. I'll be listening to a podcast in the car, make a stop, get back in, and when I go to play the podcast it launches me into my liked songs. It only does this with my car bluetooth. The bluetooth in my car is one of those FM transmitter ones you plug into the cigarette lighter so it can't be a \"car issue.\"",
            "literally!! oh my god i'm so mad. what is even the point of the middle \"main\" section of the screen anymore? do they think my main focus is scrolling endlessly through their awful algorithmic playlists?? why the fuck is every useful menu getting shoved into tiny sections on the left or right all on top of each other so you have to pick between seeing what the hell you're listening to or choosing what track is coming up next?",
            "Dud they made smart shuffle mandatory unless you have premium it's bullshit I don't get the updates at all I'm done useing this app",
            "your account may be hacked, change the password to be safe",
            "It's ridiculous they still haven't fixed this.",
            "Same here!! Drives me nuts...",
            "I am also upset by this, I thought it was just a bug they would fix fairly quickly but it's been at least a week now",
            "For Android, Windows, and Mac, you can download old versions of Spotify from here: https://en.uptodown.com/developer/spotify-ltd\n\nI recently used this site to roll back on Android due to Bluetooth issues with my car and haven't had any issues. You'd have to go back a ways to roll back some of the UI changes and there may be issues if you go back too far, but the only way to know is to try it out. \n\nI believe Apple doesn't let users sideload apps on iOS, so you're out of luck if you have an iPhone.",
            "This seems to be a change implemented in the last year and it frustrates me to no end.",
            "This is an issue I've been having! I used to discover so much new music through the artist/song radio stations, and now it tends to pick a lot of songs that \"fit\" whatever genre matches the song/artist I picked as a starting point for a radio station that are already in a lot of my playlists. No, Spotify, I want NEW music please.  \n\n\nAnd on top of that, the \"radio\" is no longer just a never ending playlist that keeps getting added to as you listen? It seems to now just set a playlist of maybe 50 songs, and then repeats that. I've been so disappointed with it lately.",
            "Is there? I can't make a post about it, have to comment here, but when I do comment here I don't see any answers. I don't know what to do?",
            "I came here to rage about this. Ive been playing my local files through my phone for months, and all of a sudden gone, greyed out. Please lmk if you find a fix and I'll do the same!",
            "This is a known bug that was reported to them a few days ago, just FYI",
            "Okay, after a bit of testing, I realized that the files ARE synced; if I pull up my local files on my phone, it's downloaded them properly. It just hasn't made the connection between the synced file and the song in my playlist. Hmm.",
            "It happened to me as well and I can't find a way to change it back",
            "I just discovered this, and it's infuriating",
            "its a joke, they should just stop serving podcasts at this point",
            "lol thats hilarious. first step is obviously to update your GPU drivers, otherwise:\n\nI would try switching your cords - sometimes DRM-protected content like spotify can cause HDCP handshake bugginess. \n\nApparently some people can also access hardware acceleration settings through the browser webapp - I would try turning that off too if you have it.",
            "This is an Android problem",
            "Agree. There is absolutely no way to hide these podcasts from showing up on the home screen!",
            "A lot of people are having this problem since Friday. It won't work on any device. PC, iPhone nor iPad. I've reinstalled and done literally every other thing they tell you to do to fix this. \n\nI was chatting with support yesterday and they said they are aware of the issue and are working on a fix. I don't know if that is BS or not.\n\nWeird thing is, I signed into a friends account and it worked fine. I told them this and they said they are working on it.\n\nIn the meantime I have found a work around. Go to an album that you like and play the last track. After the last track it starts autoplaying similar music.\n\nBut it is annoying as hell.",
            "I am also experiencing this. To the point where when I ask it to play a certain song, I know exactly what will be played next and in what order.\n\nEx. I'm living my best life in the shower. I ask my Google Assistant to slap on 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody Who Loves Me,' a most danceable hit by Miss Whitney Houston (RIP). Without fail, the algorithm in the sky will play 'Walking on Broken Glass' by Annie Lenox, also a banger to shower dance to.\n\nMy brain now associates the two songs in an almost Pavlovian fashion. I was with my gaggle of gays last weekend for a friend's annual Hanukkah party. Our dance kween DJ friend puts on 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody...,' because OBVIOUSLY, and my ass is like CONFUSED why I'm not hearin' Annie Lenox next. Granted, I was medium high then, but IT'S A BOTH AND, OK!?! \n\nI blame it on the algorithm",
            "A premium subscription is only for ad-free music. All podcasts on Spotify have either embedded or programmatic ads. That\u2019s the only way the podcast creators or Spotify can earn money from them.",

            "Try turning it off on Android Auto lol. Smart shuffle takes so long to load that the button shows disabled, and then magically appears again and you never know if it's on or off or not until you've crashed because you're busy fucking about with the world's laggiest button",
            "It feels like every time I open it up, something is worse. It\u2019s so irritating.",
            "I found a way, but it takes extra clicks. Open the Now Playing view (album art, or button next to lyrics), and click the name of the playlist at the top.\n\nIf you click the name of the playlist again, it will take you to the top. Clicking any more doesn't do anything. You have to navigate away to do it again.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to work on Liked Songs.",

The first day or two that this update was live (when I posted this comment), it functioned the way I described\n\nEdit: Notably, with the fix, I actually like this update for the most part. I think there are still some kinks that need to be worked out, and I do think that having a separate like button in addition to the add to playlist button would be ideal, but overall I think it's a good idea"

            "I'm a Queen fan, and my least favourite is Flash Gordon. It is a little bit of a cheat because it is a soundtrack, but they also did music for Highlander, and that is a top-tier set of songs on probably my favourite album by Queen.\n\nFlash is an OK song, but it is probably the peak of the album.

Overrated though.\n\nI would say Tonight through to hours is his worst run, except Earthling which is a pretty great album.",

            "I included Let's Dance because it's the beginning of Bowie's creative slump and in my opinion, it's almost as weak songwriting-wise as Tonight. What keeps it from being as weak as the other two are Nile Rodgers' stellar production and SVR's guitar work. Both LD and Tonight are above NLMD because both records each have an incredible song in each, Cat People and Loving The Alien (which I consider the best Bowie song of the era).\n\nA lot of the weaker aspects in the other two records are here too: uninspired filler tracks (Ricochet, Without You, Shake It), covers which I personally consider to be inferior to the originals and don't really add anything (China Girl, Criminal World) and a re-recorded version of an older song (Cat People, but I do like this version a lot more).\n\nThis was the first instance in which a Bowie album was just the singles and offered little else in the album itself and without Rodgers and SVR, the charm faded away to leave these issues in full display. Even in the case of Space Oddity, which people just remember for the title track, the album itself offers absolute jewels of Bowie's discography such as Cygnet Committee, Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud and Memory of a Free Festival.\n\nAnd yeah, 90's Bowie is very divisive. I personally love 1. Outside and Earthling and just a month ago Black Tie White Noise finally clicked with me. I should listen to hours again soon, haven't listened to it in like 10 years or so, but I do remember thinking \"meh\" afterwards.",
