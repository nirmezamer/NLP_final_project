            "Is this truly the most Scottish game ever made?",
            "Just finished the game last night! Had me and my partner in tears by the end! One question I\u2019ve been meaning to ask is what inspired you for the monster designs? I feel like \u201cThe Thing\u201d was a big inspiration for you guys",
            "I\u2019ve got no questions, just wanted to congratulate you on the release. loving the game so far!",
            "Why are you called the Chinese Room?",
            "Hi, I love the game. Do you guys have any plans for DLC or anything like that?",
            "Hi - I don't really have a question, I just want to say thank you for including Scottish Gaidhlig as one of the language options - this means a lot to us. Thoroughly enjoying the game.",
            "Alrighty! We're here. :)  \n  \nHuge thanks for everyone's love for \"Still Wakes the Deep\" - it's been a wonderful couple of days reading everyone's reactions. <3\n\nSome team members are already prepping some answers - fire away, we'll try answer as many as we can!",
            "Great game!",
            "Hi, Mar is here, first i want to say thank you for making a best game of the year for me, I love how you could made everyone in the story, rootable, Caz is the great flaw character and hope you will have a success after released the game\n\nQuestion 1: Why we don't know what a \"DEEP\" is, it's lovecraftian or something you want to represent as unknown things is so terrified?\n\nQuestion 2: How did you named this game with a much context as STILL WAKES THE DEEP, i mean it's a great name that show how deep the game was.\n\n  \nI wish we will saw Caz's face before ending, but I guess that's up to Our interpret.\n\nThank you!",
            "Can we get a DLC that tells the story from the naked showering man\u2019s perspective?",
            "Hey guys, loving the game so far. The tenticles on the creatures are a great part of their design, especially when they stick and retract.\u00a0 Did the tentacles cause any issues during development?",
            "Why am I not allowed to take my trusty infinite fire extinguisher everywhere? Was really bummed you made me drop it\n\nEDIT: Thank you for letting Rennick's Heli Crash. Fuck that prick",
            "Hey there!\n\nFirstly, congratulations on the release!  \ud83c\udf89  I'm a few hours in and completely hooked. The game's quality is exceptional, and I'm truly blown away by so many aspects, from the art and audio design to the voice acting and more. As a 42-year-old guy from Arbroath who now lives down south, the entire game has made me very nostalgic for home. Finlay has me in stitches every time.  Fantastic work!\n\nI have a question about the reference gathering for the oil rig environment design and interactions. Did you have the opportunity to access any active rigs for research, or was it all accomplished through online resources? Although I've never been on a rig myself, your game has made me feel as though I have now. I'd love to hear more about your process.  \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Hey-o. The character's voice work and writing were very natural. I imagine this was integral to the experience you wanted to create. How did you approach working with the actors to achieve this level of quality, and did it differ from previous projects? Congrats on the game, I enjoyed it a lot.",
            "I am very interested in the development process of the game. I want to know if there are any iterations in the level, scene, character and plot design that have not been preserved during the entire design process?\n\nIn addition, deep sea, claustrophobic space, and cosmic horror themes are also very attractive to me. I want to know if the production team has any ideas for making a sequel/derivative/similar inspiration for this game?",
            "I don\u2019t have a question, I just want to congratulate you guys\n\nI don\u2019t know how far I am >!I just got the helicopter crash!< and really enjoy the experience so far",
            "Were you worried about the Amazon show the Rig releasing recently, with it having some similarity\u2019s and not exciting audiences all that much ?",
            "Does the game use UE5\u2019s Lumen on console?\n\nIf so, what has this technology enabled for the art and lighting of the game? What are the key benefits and how did the team have to adapt?",
            "Finished this game in two sessions. Really enjoyed it. I just wish I\u2019d realized there was a performance mode sooner, I only noticed that half way through. \ud83d\ude05\n\nDo you see any potential for a sequel? Or do you see this as a self-contained story? I\u2019d love to know more about the >!monsters\u2019 origin!<. Is there any lore to that? Or do you prefer keeping it vague? I'd love to see an alternative timeline (DLC?) where >!they make it to land.!<",
            "No real question but I wanted to say I\u2019m playing through at the moment and absolutely LOVE it. \n\nAdore the Aberdeen accents, really enjoy the disparity between Caz and the subtitles (Leccy vs electric, Shite vs shit etc), absolutely nails the dialect. I think I\u2019ll go gaelic for playthrough 2!",
            "Can you share what pieces of media were your biggest influences? I\u2019m a few hours in and have picked up (and appreciated) the strong references to John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, but I want to know what else I should add to my viewing list!",
            "Hi, congratulations on the release.\n\nI've got the game downloaded and can't wait to play it this weekend. A story driven horror game, sign me up.\n\nHow did you decide on an oil rig off the coast of Scotland as your location? It's a very interesting setting.",
            "What are the benefits and risks of putting a game on GamePass from a developers perspective?",
            "Could you please confirm in detail what render resolution the game is running in on the Xbox Series S, and on the Xbox Series X (in both modes), including what native internal resolution it is upscaling/reconstructing from in case there's such a technique being used?\n\n  \nAlso, are there any plans to add a performance mode to the game on Xbox Series S? I've FPS tested the game myself over on my channel, and while it is mostly a very stable game, it would be cool for Xbox Series S users to experience it at 60fps as well.\n\n  \nThank you so much - I love the game!",
            "Hi ! Congrats on the game, really enjoying my experience so far ! Just wondering if there was any plans for patches in the near future ? While I think the game is great, I did run into a couple of performance issues. Lots of stuttering and loss of framerate especially on the \"fidelity\" graphics mode. Much obliged !",
            "I just wanted to say that I have followed you all for a long time and you never fail to impress. I only picked this game up because I have loved every single game you all have put out into the world. You have a wonderful way of tapping into the depths of the human experience. Thank you for creating, yet another game full of mystery but also so full of heart and soul. I'll be pondering what this all means for a long time to come.",
            "Why do the PC version on the game on game pass not have upscalers like FSR3 and DLSS but the steam version has this? Also do you plan on implementing this on the game pass version anytime soon?",
            "The fidelity in this game is insane! How do you achieve such high fidelity?",
            "First off, congratulations on your release! I finished the game last night and loved it, I\u2019m still thinking about the story. Idk if you can answer this question or you\u2019d want to leave it to player speculation, but I always wondered about what was happening when Caz is killed by one of the creatures. We see random images flashing on the screen which look to be memories. Are they Caz\u2019s memories, or the memories of the victims turned monsters? The images flashing seem to change from monster to monster if I\u2019m not mistaken.",
            "I know this probably wont get seen but if you happen to come back later I just wanted to ask: \n\nI noticed that in both this game and Dear Esther, there is a subtle detail where the progression of the game comes from an aerial/ radio tower. In Dear Esther, it comes from gradually moving closer to it, and the game finishes when you climb it. In SWTD, the radio tower gradually gets more and more infested, and the game ends when you enter it. \n\nWas this an intentional correlation? And was Roy\u2019s mention of religion also meant to correlate with Dear Esther\u2019s?",
            "Where there any specific cosmic horror fiction that you were inspired by when making this game?",
            "The McLeery achievement had me laughing my ass off. Such an odd achievement for being a creeper. Enjoying the game. Well done.",
            "Any chance a patch is coming for a specific underwater section in engineering. I\u2019m trying to not spoil anything but I can not progress past a certain point as it will not let me through a small area with pipes.",
            "Loving the game so much!!! I love the setting you have chosen as well! There's so much I want to ask! What was the inspiration behind your game? Mainly in regards for the setting and the plot. \n\nAnd will y'all set up an Instagram social at all?",
            "Just a message to thank Fraser for the scary snakes. He'll know.",
            "Switch port plz.",
            "I love the game, that is all. Could put dlss in, grumble grumble.",
            "I'm Japanese and I'm wondering why there are multiple English subtitles but only \"Nagasaki dialect\" for Japanese subtitles?\n\nI would like subtitles that are closer to the standard Japanese language, because this is a horror game and the subtitles are spoiling the tension.\n\nAlso, do you intend to continue this localization of accents as dialects in VTM Bloodlines 2?",
            "Was there ever any concern that Still Wakes the Deep might get the same treatment from audiences as Machine for Pigs, considering your minimalistic approach to gameplay?\n\nHow do you feel about Chinese Room's legacy now? Haven't both Dan Pinchbeck and Jessica Curry left? Do you plan on continuing in the minimal gameplay / maximum narrative direction, or will you be changing course?\n\n(I really like Still Wakes the Deep so far, by the way. You've really nailed the setting, it's incredible!)",
            "What was your inspiration for the monster?",
            "I loved Dear Esther but I dont like horror. Can this game still be for me?",
            "Aint you guys doing vampires masquerade bloodlines II\n\nHow are you guys feeling about it?",
            "Such an amazing game, its been on my radar for a bit now and i won't lie i was a bit sceptical but after playing i just have to love it, horror game + oil rig + Scottish accent = PERFECTION, and also an amazing gameplay, atmosphere, performances. JUST THANK YOU!",
            "I will experience your Master piece on the Quest 3 via Geforce Now and Gamepass Ultimate. Its gonna be so immersive, i am already afraid.",
            "What was the creature, or will we ever find out more in the future?",
            "How much did it cost to make still wakes the deep? im always curious about how much certain games cost to make.",
            "Huge thanks for this wonderful AMA, we enjoyed it profusely.  \nDo consider asking any of your remaining Qs on our studio's Subreddit ;)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheChineseRoom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheChineseRoom/)\n\nThank you, all! \u2728",
            "Are the character names an homage to other characters? Such as Dobbie, scooby, Brodie and Bruce? Like Harry Potter, scooby doo, Jaws, and evil dead? Absolutely loving the game! Me and my friend are doing a play through now and I haven\u2019t screamed like this in years lol",
            "I\u2019m playing it on Xbox Series X. So far so good!",
            "A big thanks on behalf of the community for making time for this!\n\nI rolled credits on the game yesterday and loved it. I thought the voice acting and audio was particularly impressive. It felt extremely authentic and really added to the atmosphere.\n\nI\u2019m especially curious about what sort of direction you gave the voice actors whose characters >!turned into monsters!<. Did you give them a lot of freedom to experiment? Or was it mostly achieved through post-processing?",
            "Two days late but finally managed to shift funds around to get the game bought and downloaded just now. Congratulations on the launch and depth of this game. In the same way you nailed the quintessential English village feel in Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, Still Wakes The Deep is looking and feeling absolutely stunning, so full of nostalgic in a horrible kind of way (I hated living through the 70s) atmosphere \ud83d\ude02 My question: are there plans to add a photo mode at some point? I do hope so!",
            "Haha not sure if we'd claim that! :D  \nBut we've been hearing that we did it justice thus far, which means so much, of course. And of course, our Project Creative Director John McCormack is a Glaswegian who remembers and knows so much about the period and the region, so it certainly comes from the heart. \n\n- Marijam (Comms team)",
            "Yes you are right! *The Thing* is a huge inspiration and a film the team is going to watch together in order to celebrate the game's launch! Body horror in general plays a big part. Cronenberg also does a great job of evoking feelings of deep disgust as well as pity and empathy in the *The Fly*. The design really came together with audio support helping to remind us of their humanity. \u00a0There's something left of who they once were - many who have families they are desperate to return to. \u00a0\n\nThe way the transformed crew move was actually inspired by a bug that occurred during development which made them move in very unexpected, twitchy ways - the team found it terrifying and so we tried to keep that sense of unpredictability and omnidirectional chaos in their animation style! \u00a0It helped us lean into the fact that we really wanted players to only catch glimpses of what was chasing them. The visual design helped in this by creating a patchwork of flesh, bone, torn overalls, viscera and organs so you could never fully grasp just what you were seeing.\u00a0\n\nOne last big influence was an overarching theme of 'transformation' and 'a terrible beauty' which we used to temper the body horror with motifs of bubbling and growing life.  \nLaura Dodds, Associate Art Director",
            "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udf0a\n\nTHANK YOU!  \nGo Rate / Review / Like / Follow us on socials etc. We want to continue doing cool games for you all, awesome  people. :)",
            "It comes from a thought experiment!\u00a0\n\nThe Chinese room suggests that however well you program a computer to learn Chinese, it doesn't really \"understand\" Chinese. It only simulates that knowledge. In short, executing an algorithm cannot be sufficient for thinking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe try to keep emotion, thought provoking theme and humanity as the center of our game so it made sense to call the studio by this name.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you want to know more about it:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese\\_room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room)\n\n- Jade Jacson, Senior Game Designer",

            "Thank you! Our Project Creative Director John McCormack had this idea and we were pleasantly surprised when our publisher Secret Mode agreed with this.

            "Hi Armanwinters12, thanks for your kind comments and questions about the title.  \nYou've nailed it in your reply really, the title has many meanings tied up in it, credit for the final formulation goes to Dan Pinchbeck but Deep as a word was in there quite early in all the suggestions.  \nStill: Silent/frozen, constant/recurring (even a whisky still but that's perhaps reaching a bit...)  \nWakes: Waking up, the wake of a ship or structure on the sea, a wake after a funeral  \nDeep: The literal depth of the ocean, things unknown beneath, or even complexity  \nThere may well be other imagery and concepts the title awakens in you, thanks again for your comments!\n\n- Rob McLachlan (Lead Game Designer)",
            "No. Age rating boards would make our life miserable.\u00a0\n\n- Bruno Julien (Executive Producer)",
            "Would have to include the part where Caz spent an inordinate amount of time crouching behind him",
            "The tentacles were fun to develop! One of the challenges was to get them to shoot in a way that was believable. We found that totally random shooting was not realistic. We took inspiration from nature and used music timing and notes to \"play\" a rhythm for shooting them. This allowed us to be quite creative in the patterns. It made the monsters even more scary too.  \nLouis Larsson-De Wet, Project Technical Director",
            "Hi SlammedOptima, thank you. It's great to hear the Rennick hate. We're really proud of him as a character and antagonist, and think his first appearance rounds off the intro nicely!\n\nFor the limitations we imposed on throwables and equipment, the frank answer is we had limited resources especially in animation. We started with a pillar to have very limited HUD and zero inventory management, and despite the fact that I'm the ultimate packrat in most games, we wanted to free you from that juggling of stuff. When we added the fire extinguisher we decided that to save a whole bunch of extra traversal animations/systems, we'd make you drop it when you moved on.\n\nSo as someone who carried the Ep2 gnome a surprisingly long distance, and the System Shock 2 basketball all the way to the end of the game, I feel your pain! We'll punish Rennick some more to make you feel better.  \nRob McLachlan, Lead Designer",
            "Unfortunately, we never did get to go and visit an oil rig, though the closest I got was visiting Loch Ness a few years back, I just couldn't justify dragging my family to Aberdeen to look at the rigs from the shore!\n\nWe did all of our research online and found some excellent resources. BP has a fantastic archive online with documentaries from that period where they were first building rigs in the north sea. There is also an online Norwegian oil rig museum which has some incredible imagery from the 70s as well as photos of items like phones, buttons and machinery. Finally, there are just some awesome folks on youtube who have recorded videos of themselves giving tours or exploring oil rings and big ships. All of these were invaluable!  \n- Ian Gillespie, Lead Environment Artist",
            "The approach has been quite similar as previous TCR games. We work with a voice director (Kate Saxon and Damian Goodwin in this case, with Kate collaborating a lot with Dan Pinchbeck who conceived the project and wrote so much of it) and actors who are strongly rooted in film, television and theatre. They may or may not also have prior games experience. Often in videogames, actor lines are recorded separately, even for scenes that have multiple characters in them. We try and get people in the same room as much as possible. We also try and organise script table reads with the cast and voice director, just like in film or tv. During recording, conversation is encouraged to flow; if lines overlap, that is fine and adds to the realism \u2013 it may make implementation a little harder, but it\u2019s worth it. We also mic up our actors in a way so that they are free to move around, and truly act. Of course though, the main ingredient is to get the right people together. Strong relationships between the voice director and cast, e.g. from previous projects, also helps in bringing out the most out of the talent.\n\n- Daan Hendriks (Audio Director)\n\n \n\nIn terms of processing/implementation, the only thing I can add is that we wanted it to sound as natural as possible, so apart from a cleaning pass and some volume adjustments we didn't do any further processing on the audio files.\n\n- Sound Designer Francesco Del Pia\n\n \n\nMore on the voice recording process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuvVm2w49GA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuvVm2w49GA)",
            "One area that has gone through a lot of iteration in particular was how the horror manifests itself onboard visually, narratively and mechanically. We explored aquatic entities, cellular ones , behaviours that altered depending on what it had fused with, was it something that learnt from it's environment - could the player interact with and teach the horror to help solve environmental puzzles? Some of these early explorations are more evident than others but it helped us try to layer complexity, emotional resonance and ambiguity in the player's various encounters with the horror element.\n\n- Lauda Dodds (Associate Art Director)",

            "Hi Night-Springs54! Our former Studio Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck came up with the idea. It's one of those ideas which seems quite obvious and promising even on first hearing! I think we were all trying to think of a game with definite physical boundaries at the time. TCR's previous games were all in defined areas eg an island, a Shropshire village... this allows players to encapsulate one place in their mind and creates useful limits on scope and focus.\n\nOnce the oil rig was locked in we were thinking a bunch about time and place. Scotland was an obvious option as we are UK-based (and there is a link with Esther), and as for time period it suited us practically and narratively to set it in the 1970s. It'd make more sense that the rig could be abandoned and out of contact for a few hours than a present day setting, and have a little more of a \"frontier\" feeling. The serendipitous and exciting connections that grew out of that research ended up being the game and narrative you see today.  \n- Rob McLachlan, Lead Designer",

            "We went through a lot of iterations and processes for the creature voices. One thing was clear from the beginning: it was crucial that they would convey a wide sense of emotions, and wouldn\u2019t be \u2018just\u2019 angry or scary monsters. These were real humans once, and your former friends and colleagues.\n\nWe began in the traditional way of using animal source sounds and layer them to produce typical \u2018creature\u2019 types of sounds; this gave us an idea of processing chains and approaches. But we always wanted to blend this with real, human voice as well.\n\nFor a long time during the project, we only wanted the creatures to convey a semblance of human speech, but not actual speech. So in early recording sessions with the cast, we had them do all sorts of things which they probably found perhaps somewhat entertaining or at least quite odd. For instance, we gave them a real script, but then asked them to perform this in various \u2018emotive\u2019 ways, to convey the meaning of the words without saying (all of) the words, and not just once, but expressing various types of emotions (angrily, in anguish, in pain, pleadingly, etc).\u00a0\n\nWe took all this and combined it with the animal sound processing approaches mentioned above, and the results were pretty interesting, but we found through playtests that what resonated best was when our creatures spoke more clearly, had more of their real 'former' human voice in there, and were more understandable in a literal sense (by saying actual words, rather than made-up word-sounds).\n\nSo we re-recorded a lot of material but now using real speech, and of course still applied processing and blended in animalistic source.\n\nVery crucially however, early on in the project we also worked with a specialist creature voice actor,\u00a0Olof J\u00f6nsson, who gave us an absolute gold mine of strange, guttural, screamy and animal-like sounds, all by twisting his vocal tracts in ways that are quite unimaginable. For a lot of the more animal-like sounds that are blended into the creature vocalisations, we used his material instead of actual animal sounds.\n\n- Daan Hendriks (Audio Director)",

            "In terms of audio, the biggest challenge was to identify which tendrils should play sounds and which shouldn't - since any tendril can play shoot, hit, and retract sounds, if all of them (up to 100 per enemy!) played these sounds it'd be a big problem for performance, and the audio mix would quickly get out of control. The selection of which tendril should play audio is mostly based on its shooting speed, length, and type.\n\nThe Tendril Hit sound is the most interesting sound, as it changes according to the surface hit by the tendril; it can play several different types of metal impacts (thin, solid, corrugated, hollow, grate, etc.), concrete, wood, glass, and so on. Additionally, impact sounds change according to the AI state of the enemy: if it's chasing you, the impacts are going to be louder, more prominent and more disruptive.\n\n- Francesco Del Pia (Sound Designer)",

            "Honestly I'm all for it, as long as they don't cost cut so much that quality clearly suffers for it.\n\n\nWe're at the point where sequels/continuations to big games take half a decade + to relase.\u00a0\n\n\n- Halo 5 - Infinite was 6 years.\n- Gears 5 - Eday is already at 5 years and will likely be six.\n- Bethesda took 8 years after Fallout 4 to release Starfield.\n- We just got Hellblade's sequel after 7 years.\n- We're going to get GTA 6 12 years after GTA 5 and 7 years after Red Dead 2.\n\n\nNow granted, COVID fucked a lot of shit up and we're finally turning the corner from it, but back in the day I remember playing games and their sequels would be out within a year or two, with 3 years usually being reserved for hardware transitions.\n\n\n- Halo 2 - 3 was 3 years. The trilogy released over 6 years and we had ODST and Reach before the end of 2009\n\n\n- The Original Jak and Daxter trilogy was released from 2001-2004\n\n\n- the Sly Cooper trilogy released from 2002-2005\n\n\n- Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 4, and Skyrim all released in a 9 year gap (2002-2011), just shy of how long it took us to get Starfield.\n\n\n- GTA 4 released in 2008 and Red Dead Redemption in 2010. Both games also received substantial DLC's before GTA 5 released in 2013...\n\n\n- From Soft released Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 from 2011-2016, with Bloodborne also releasing in that timeframe, with every game getting DLC.\n\n\n-\u00a0 After Dark Souls was done we got Sekiro in 2019, Elden Ring in 2022, and Armored Core in 2023.\n\n\nThe scope creep and dev times on a lot of games are out of hand. I'm all for supporting the creative process, but when devs like From Soft have put out 7 critically acclaimed games in 12 years and just released a game sized expansion to Elden Ring, which is now the highest rated expansion to a game **ever** in the 13th year since Dark souls 1 and in that time we've gotten like 3 games each from exclusive properties it's just getting ridiculous.",
            "2 years for the Elden Ring expansion is still too much, The Witcher 3 or Skyrim delivered equally big expansions much faster.\n\nPlus From Software is a bad example because their games are 90% just copy & paste from previous titles, half the enemies in Elden Ring are ripped from Dark Souls and Bloodborne complete with the same move sets and sounds. There is the same door opening animation since DS1. Of course they can make games faster that way when they barely improve.",
            "Don't forget a lot of games have an artificial wait time because of the online service games that are propped forward to be money makers. I'm convinced the only reason they made Starfield was because Bethesda wanted to make a new game that wouldn't tank Elder Scrolls Online or Fallout 76. GTA5... nuff said, GTA online prints money and is way cheaper to maintain instead of jumping straight into GTA6.\n\n\nAll of those older games you mentioned didn't have that variable to consider. They only made their money the first couple weeks of release then the used game market would gobble it up. It's no wonder they dive directly into making the next game.",
            "Hellblade 2 is such a joke. Mind you it's one of the most beautiful games out there and without a doubt the animation quality is baffling. It feel unreal at a point at how realistic the overall movements of characters can be.\n\nBut in the end its like a glorified tech demo than a game.",
            "They are reusing some animations and maybe few enemies but it no where near as you exaggerate to be. They also do fully new map, art, great number of enemies, new lore and so on. FromSoftware develops games quickly because they don\u2019t do tons of mocap, voice recording etc. Also they really don\u2019t care about optimization too.",

CDPR masterfully crafted Dogtown and somehow perfectly blended it with the rest of Night City while maintaining excellent graphical fidelity. Then there\u2019s the actual story and characters. I loved the mix of genres and inspirations. Escape From New York, Apocalypse Now, and 007, all mixed together with a coat of cyberpunk paint.",
            "I played Cyberpunk on last gen sadly at launch, got through it and it was fine but nothing overly special. Moved to next gen, but didn't buy it again. Dabbled with it again on a free weekend once for maybe 30 mins. What about the expansion made the game worth playing again?",
            "yes, Witcher 3 won like 250 GOTY and God of War 2018 got like 270 GOTY, not many games win above 300, its only Elden Ring and TLOU2 as far as i know.",

So like James Bond, Mission Impossible, etc. I also love John Wick and similar action films with a focus on fast gunplay action. So admittedly my adoration for Cyberpunk is rooted in things I simply enjoy already and there\u2019s a notable bias there. \n\nPhantom Liberty took that idea and pushed it forward. It is very focused on espionage, trust no one, double crosses, and quiet set pieces. There\u2019s a bit where you play roulette with some targets and use gadgets and conversation to extract the information and it was just plain cool. Absolutely dripping in what I love (to further this, you even get a dialog option to order a gin and tonic during this time which is my drink)\n\nSo it\u2019s difficult for me to really explain or recommend when it is just so much of just what I love. But I find the gameplay smooth, I think the story is excellent, the soundtrack slaps, and I adore the way you interact with the world. It feels alive. Talking with characters as you maneuver through a giant crowd, or take a seat at a food stand, I applaud the push towards a more engaging immersive experience.",

No idea if Elden Ring is any different though.\n\nI also rarely buy AAA games because I'm not a massive fan of mainstream products but Elden Ring does seem different so I'll wait for a sale.",

I do think optimizing for the Series S could be making some game development take longer, and I think the BEST option would be to allow devs to delay specifically the series S versions of games if need be, because IF this is a case of the series S holding the game back and not some Sony exclusive deal, then it\u2019s not fair to the people who spent more on the series X. Like it did really suck that I had to wait months to play BG3 with my friends because of the series S, even though we all have the series X. Something I\u2019ve noticed is a lot of times with newer games, the PC requirements are higher than what the Series S is even comparable to, which props for the devs to get it running on that. But, if on PC you need stronger hardware just to run the game, even with all the graphical options, then it\u2019s definitely cutting into their dev time by a lot. A lot of new games feel like they could be PS4 games despite the ps5 and series x being extremely powerful.

            "Agreed, they should have been multi platform.",
            "It's not a false claim though. On PC the game requires a min of 16gb RAM + an 8gb GPU. The Series S has a combined 10gb - so that's gonna affect optimisations.\n\nSure, they could probably get it running at sub-SD resolutions like we've seen in other UE5 games, but I imagine they want to try and put out a good looking game and not something on-par with the Wii.\n\nIf Sony had ANY exclusivity with the game, the trailer would say this, Sony would also say this, and all posts on X would make it very obvious. We know that Sony loves promoting their timed exclusives. It's just Jez being a cry baby, as usual",
            "> No it\u2019s not PC.\n\nHypothetical: \ud83d\udc46 That sounds great until your lead dev explains to you it is imperative to Sony that your game can also port to PC a year from now.  Sony doesn\u2019t care what *your* standard of PC specs are.  The client wants the *most* PCs able to run their game.  Series S dwarfs those specs.",
            "Right, I see that now, I agree, issue is that BG3 didn't really run great on other platforms either, and the fact split screen rendered it twice didn't help\n\nBut yeah, it feels Xbox is pitching for PlayStation to hit perfect home runs",
            "So lower pc specs doesn\u2019t affects the games this generation but series s affected it ? \n\n[That statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/s/HoK7c4DLNQ) is bullshit and almost everyone knows it. KCD 1 runs on a switch"

            "Fuck that would be epic on today\u2019s hardware. Miss games like this and mercenaries from pandemic where it\u2019s just a great fuck around environment. Just cause is still alive I guess.",
            "Embracer's self-destruction needs to be studied. I don't think I've ever seen a company chuck every egg possible into as uncertain of a basket just before it blew up in their face the way it happened to them",
            "I miss the red faction game from the ps2",
            "Embracer staked way to much on a contract with no plan b. Biggest clowns in the industry right now.",

            "Babe, you just broke up with me just as I was about to start a gym membership.",
            "Damn it \n\nEmbracer is a cancer",
            "I miss the rail gun",

            "Wtf are embracer? \n\nHow are these fucks not being investigated by the EU? \n\nThey sound Dodgy as fuck",
            "That's not what it says, though. They created a visual (as in a target render) prototype. And the game wasn't greenlit. So no, they were never working on a new Red Faction, they tried to pitch the idea of one.",
            "imagine being so fucking wreckless before the deal is went through and forced to cut massively due to your massive fuck up",
            "Embracer is a total train wreck. Shoved almost $1billion off on Asmodee as part of the spinning off into separate companies and continues to shutter and cancel things to reduce expenditures.",
            "Fuck",

            "You have no idea if the game was good or not. They could have been doing us a favor",
            "Exactly the only reason why I like just cause lol. Mercenaries remake would hit hard but knowing EA today that game would be broken into dlc",

            "Nobody reads the damn article these days.",

            "I see this meme go around but Embracer\u2019s cuts really haven\u2019t been that far off the 7-9% headcount reductions that nearly *every* publisher has made in the past 12 months. The games media know that Embracer is a soft target though and run articles like this constantly.\n\nThe would-be deal with the Saudi investment fund is also completely misunderstood by most people, it would have added an extra 10% of revenue over the course of like 6 years, they weren\u2019t buying the company or providing an existential lifeline like people seem to think.",
            "Yeah cancel all games, they could be good or bad. Who needs to know.",
            "Yeah the first one",
            "Your sarcasm is well noted. But it _is_ the thing the current team had brought us, not a previous team years ago that everyone is fantasizing about. Do you think they could have made FreeSpace 3, either?",
            "I guess lamenting over the loss of a game you didn't know about before 5 minutes ago so you can use it as a cudgel to beat the Big Bad Company\u2122 you don't like is more productive.",
            "I remember buying that the day it came out",
            "Don\u2019t listen to him he\u2019s missing your point and being rude lol",
            "By this logic, just cancel every video game in development ever. They might be doing us a favor because all 2 billion of them could be hot garbage. Doesn't matter if you ever saw footage or played it, it must be bad because it got canceled and you clearly didn't know anything about it until you knew it was canceled, so it must be bad.",

            "My brothers and I would play the shit out it. Destroy the walls and make our own paths everywhere. Was great!",
            "The only people with any actual insight into the game\u2019s quality were the people who cancelled it",
            "no that's not the logic. The logic is why give a shit about a game you know ZERO about. Before this post you didn't even know it was being made so who gives a shit if it was cancelled? Your day is the exact same.",
