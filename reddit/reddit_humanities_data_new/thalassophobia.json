            "Cause who knows what comes up when the sun goes down \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019m shaking rn thinking about it. This one time, I was on a cruise to Mozambique, and my partner wanted to go out for a smoke..it was daytime, as he was smoking I look at him, and I say to him, I just saw a shark, a big one, eating violently on something..he turns to me, and says, every time you get close to water you imagine seeing crocs, or sharks..the guy next to us says he saw it too\u2026so now you can understand why I\u2019m shaking for this guy.",
            "Lol",
            "I was thinking he looks too far from the boat, with a completely disorienting empty horizon on each side I\u2019d be scared that he\u2019d drift far enough to lose sight of the boat, then how easy would it be to never find it again.",
            "Wow thanks for the anecdote! I feel u, and am currently binging his vids on tik tok\u2026 do u think it\u2019s bravery or mental issues that pushed him to do this absolutely incredible yet insane feat?"

Given they work as professional divers, they likely aren't afraid of diving related things unless there's an actual risk to safety (too stormy of conditions, etc).  Their fears are probably random... one might be afraid of spiders, another afraid of heights, etc.  \n  \nFun answer:  Cthulu.... they're afraid of Cthulu until they come to love and warship it.",
