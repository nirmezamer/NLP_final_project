If you can't find a solution there contact Larian support as detailed.\n\n>Do I need to play the previous game to understand the story?\n\nNo, there is a timegap of 1000 years between DOS and DOS2. The overall timeline of the Divinity games in perspective to DOS2 looks like this: DOS2 is set 1222 years after DOS1, 24 years after Divine Divinity, 4 years after Beyond Divinity, and 58 years before Divinity 2.\n\n>How many people can play at once?\n\n* Up to 4 Players in the campaign and up to 4 players and a gamemaster in Gamemaster Mode.\n\n>Do I need to buy the game to play with my friends.\n\n* That depends on how you will play. Up to 2 Players can play on the same PC for a \"couch coop\" experience. This means you can have 4 player sessions with 2 copies of the game when using this method. If you don't play on the same PC each player is going to require his/her own copy.\n\n>Can I mix and match inputs for PC couch coop?\n\n* You can't use keyboard and mouse for couch coop, however you can mix controllers.\n\n>What's the deal with origin stories?\n\n* A custom character has no ties in the world whatsoever, nobody knows you. Origin characters on the other hand do have ties in the gameworld, that means people can recognise you and might interact differently with an origin character because of that characters reputation or because the characters have met before. Furthermore origin characters have their own questlines that run alongside the main story.\n\n>I don't like my build! Can I change it?\n\n* Yes! Once you leave the first island you get access to infinite respecs, with the second gift bag you can even get a respec mirror on the first island.\n\n>What are the new crafting recipes from the gift bag?\n\n* [List](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137514488)",

Fane is a bit weak, mainly conjures incarnates and totems, but does have searing daggers, which would be ideal with traps later on. \n\nWeak point is Lohse, she basically has a few aerothurge spells and healing but is otherwise cannon fodder.\n\n**Next Quest Question**: Arena fight?

            "Can randomly found rings have rune slots or is that exclusive to the ring of intelligence",
            "So I've been thinking about tankiness in this game and I came to the conclusion that tanks don't really exist, and mages are the tankiest characters in the game. I feel like I am wrong, but I can't think of a way that I am.\n\nSo first of all constitution is pretty useless. Maintaining armor is by far the most important thing in order to prevent CC, and having more base health doesn't tend to be all that important since losing your armor would just lead to endless cycles of not having turns and ultimately dying. And even if you didn't die, there is not much difference between being knocked down and being dead. Therefore, you can't make a tank by stacking constitution and therefore there won't be much of a difference in that way between a front line tank and ranged characters.\n\nNext, gear isn't really unique to anyone. The requirements to wear certain pieces of gear are so low, that meeting them on your non-tank characters is trivial. I'll normally accidentally have enough str to wear str gear on a mage just from random rings and stuff having str on it in addition to other good stats I wanted. And even if I didn't, it only takes 1 lvl worth of stats to be able to wear basically anything I want. Further, the gear across str/fin/int isn't all that different in numbers, the difference is just in allocation of magic vs phys armor. Like mage gear has a ton of MA and not PA and str armor is the reverse, but they are both strong pieces. So just by mixing up a little bit of what you are wearing can allow you to have comprehensive coverage across all class archetypes. Further, you can get int stats on str gear and vica-versa, so you don't lose out on anything by wearing full tank armor on a mage. Thus, gear doesn't make a difference.\n\nIn terms of skills, almost all of the good tank skills are support skills for mage classes. Geo gives most of the PA and hydro gives most of the MA. Polymorph has some stuff but you could also take that on a mage and even if you didn't it won't matter because you don't really need heart of steel to be strong.\n\nLast, and most important, the ONLY distinction I can make between characters and their tankiness is whether or not they are wearing a shield. And this is where things get the most interesting because it seems to favor mage classes! If you are melee, there is a distinct difference in damage between a 1H+Sheild and a 2H / Duel wield, so if you wanted to be a melee DPS you're not going to have a shield. But as a mage, you can easily be DPS AND have a shield. In fact, I can't really think of much of a reason to not have a shield since the damage from 2 wands is not that great and having a wand is frequently advantageous vs a staff. If you were to use a staff or a second wand it would mostly be as a stat stick, but again, you can still get good stats on a shield and even if the wands typically have better stats, you are trading off a few points of int or pyro for a fuck ton of defense, so the trade just seems skewed in a way that allows you to justifiable use a shield, unlike melee DPS where you can't forgo 2x Daggers or a 2H if you're trying to do a lot of damage.\n\nWhere am I wrong?",

And when I use the same spell to hit just one target, sometimes it did Spark; I even read the combat log to verify the damage to make sure that my eyes are functional; it was in the Arena fight BTW, three foes within 5 meters\n\nUpon googling, I read some other players have similar issues\n\nEven if this team can progress, I feel like the non-Source version of the Spark is a bad idea in early game, so I'm considering to restart as a regular ranged mage team\n\nOr anyone has some suggestions to save this team?

Prioritize Aero if in doubt\n* Damage Type: Magical (Air, Water)\n* Main ability schools for skills: Aero and Hydro\n\nStart out with that and get into the game. While you can obviously get into a stronger starting position by customizing your MC etc. this is already strong enough for sure without requiring any extra input by you. As you level up, just assign stats mostly according to the advice above. Get the skills that seem interesting to you. If you want I can write up some recommended skills, but I don't want to drown you in information instantly.\n\nYou should still branch out in a few other abilities for utility skills. You don't always need to use your stats for these if gear with the respective ability bonuses is available. Here's a list of useful dips:\n\n* 2 Aero: Teleport (good to have multiple times in your party), Evasion\n* 1 Pyro: Peace of Mind, Haste (one character with these buffs is enough)\n* 2 Scoundrel: Adrenaline (literally every character benefits greatly from this skill), Cloak and Dagger\n* 1 Polymorph: Chameleon Cloak\n\nChoose classic difficulty or lower - Tactician is balanced for people who've already finished the game or are looking for a serious challenge.

Even just ONE level of difference makes a huge difference, especially in early game.

A bit cheesy but if you're struggling then why not.\n\nOtherwise, use Fortify skill/scrolls to gain more physical armor to prevent the archers from knocking you down. Bait the archers down from highground because they get bonus damage from height. You can also teleport the dog into the empty room on the left (with the small ladder) if you position yourself right.

            "It's valid criticism and if I recall correctly even the CEO/lead designer said the armor system might have been a mistake, or at least the way it was implemented. I like the idea that it replaces a lot of RNG: instead of a generally lower hit chance (like in D&D) you just have to destroy armor instead. And most players tend to enjoy hitting consistently instead of missing a lot. It also makes it easier to predict everything related to combat. Some may argue that this may lead to combat becoming somewhat formulaic but this has never bothered me. \n\nI do agree it would be better to have a single armor type system instead of splitting into physical/magical. On the other hand, I've never really had any issues playing with a mixed party. But, I don't see any real benefit of having two armor types and having just one would at the very least make parties with one physical and three magical damage dealers (or the other way around) viable. It would also take the pressure off beginners who are inexperienced with different damage types and build synergy.

(If you use totems/incarnate on a surface they will deal that type of damage).\n\nIf you're happy with 4 x Glass Cannon then go for it. But I usually avoid that talent completely since enemies *will* apply all kind of status effects on you without having to break your armor first (poison, burning, frozen, knock down, shocked, etc). And that really sucks. Your armor exist primarly to block status effects, and Glass Cannon nullifies that. \n\nArena fight is easier than Houndmaster in my opinion. At lvl 4 both should be pretty balanced fights though (arena might even be too easy depending on character builds/game knowledge). \n\nIf you actively plan turn orders someone else in your party can teleport enemies near Sebille if she will get her turn before them.

You're kinda restricted in low levels in D&D and you can only play up to lvl 4 in BG3 early access. DOS2 on the other hand allows for much more versatility even in low levels.",
            "I think playing an Origin character the first time around is the way to go. Just pick your favorite one for now, don't focus too much on whether it perfectly meshes with whatever build you end up picking. On later playthroughs when you've seen more of what the game has to offer, you might start going for a custom main character.\n\nI can't recommend any build in particular to you because I have no idea what you'll like. Physical damage builds are often very reliable because there's virtually nothing in the game immune to physical damage, but (aside from Necro) tend to be less interesting and get less skills to use. This is fine if you're playing singleplayer because you'll be playing 2-4 characters at once with different builds, but in multiplayer it can get a little boring to be a Ranger, from personal experience, even if you shit out damage. Elemental builds are more interesting and fun to play, as least for me, but there will be several enemies throughout the game that'll be very resistance/immune to particular elements (ESPECIALLY true for poison builds) and so while they can be damage powerhouses, they aren't quite as reliable, so you'll probably need to give them other skills to use for some fights.\n\nJust take note that because of the armor system in this game, mixed damage is generally less powerful than full physical or full magic. And if you have 3 magic and 1 physical (or vice versa) then that's really bad, as that physical character will have to break through their corresponding armor by him/herself while the others can team up to break down the other corresponding armor, making it really inefficient. But mixed damage is fine (if you want to try out a variety of builds) but try to go half physical, half magic if you do. You'll thank yourself soon enough.\n\nNote that you'll probably have 3 other companions with which to try out builds, not even including later playthroughs. And respecing is pretty easy (once you get to Act 2, unless you're using the gift bags) and only really costs money to buy skill books and alternate gear. You can get money via selling gear you don't need, and thievery. You'll almost certainly have a character devoted to thievery anyway (for lockpicking) so you may as well pickpocket as well.",

            "A summoner isn't going to struggle too much at later acts, it's just that *comparatively* it will be much weaker than the other options. The problem with summoners is that they only scale off of summoning, so boosting attributes doesn't affect your damage whatsoever. That being said, they can be a lot of fun to play and this game isn't that hard that you need fully optimized characters.\n\nThe real issue here is team synergy or the lack thereof rather. Ideally your whole team will do the same type of damage (as in either magic damage or physical damage), but it can be beneficial for a new player to run a split damage team because it can help to be able to choose the damage type you are targeting when you don't know what to expect when going into the encounter for the first time. If you *do* run a split damage party you need to make sure that every character can do both physical and magic damage, so that they can pick and choose depending on the scenario.\n\nThe most important thing to make sure is that you aren't having allies attack the same enemy with two different damage types, because when that's the case you need to go through two layers of armor instead of one.\n\nbtw I highly recommend you take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/nodvxx/a_guide_for_new_and_intimidate_players_for_how_to/) guide I made a while back if you want a better understanding of how the character sheet works and some tips that should help you create your characters.\n\nFeel free to ask any question you might have :D",

            "> It seems like most things have potential to work fine\n\nRight on the money. My advice is build what you want to build - as long as it's reasonably focused and you're not going for a jack of all trades, you'll be fine. \n\nThe way I do attributes is dead simple: Do I need more memory slots? If so, I will consider a point in Memory. If not, dump all my points into my damage stat (Strength, Intelligence, or Finesse depending on the character). On the tank you'll want a point or two in Constitution here or there.\n\nSome combinations will be better and more powerful than others, but keep in mind no mistake is final - if you're using the gift bags, you even have access to a Magic Mirror (free respec of everything except race) in Fort Joy, but if not you will have access to it eventually. Part of the fun of this game is experimenting to see which things work together.\n\n>Trying to build a tanky/support character that still can damage some through summoning\n\nIn this case I would recommend calling Summoning your main stat. Since you want to tank and your actual character won't necessarily be a heavy attacker, your choice of weapon isn't *too* important, but I recommend a shield and either a wand or a 1-handed melee weapon, because shields are *great* for tanks who don't hit hard. (Shields give you a bunch of extra armor, and when you lose it, you can use Shields Up - a skill every shield gives you for free - to get some back.)\n\nYou will definitely want some amount of Warfare - it has access to Bouncing Shield, a physical attack that doesn't scale off your stats (huge on a build that isn't built as an attacker) and, later in the game, the Provoke ability - key on a Tank. \n\nI'd also recommend considering 1-2 point dips in Necromancer, Hydrosophist, Pyromancer, Huntsman, and Geomancer. Each of these skills has level 1-2 spells that will help you achieve your build:\n\n* Necromancer has Blood Sucker for (conditional) healing, as well as Raise Bloated Corpse and Raise Bone Widow for extra summon options. It also has an infusion for your summon (Blood Infusion).\n* Hydrosophist provides Armor of Frost (buffs Magic Armor and removes some magic statuses), Restoration (healing), and Rain early, and later pairs with Warfare to open Cleanse Wounds and Mass Cleanse Wounds, and well as many other healing spells. This is \"the Healer skill.\" Additionally, *all* times you heal or buff someone's health or Magic Armor, those numbers are based on this skill (unless you use a scroll), *including spells from other skills*. It also has infusions for your summon (Water infusion, and later Ice Infusion).\n* Pyromancer gives you access to Peace of Mind and Haste, two of the best buffs in the game. (Peace of Mind in particular is great for a support, since it can clear some mental statuses.) It also has an infusion for your summon (Fire Infusion, and later Necrofire Infusion).\n* Huntsman offers First Aid, a healing spell that removes some different statuses from Restoration (offering more coverage, if you have both). At its 2nd level you can pick up Tactical Retreat, which imo is the best self-teleport spell in the game.\n* Geomancer offers Fortify (buffs Physical armor and removes some physical statuses), as well as some other Physical Armor-related spells you are probably unlikely to use. Additionally, *all* times you heal or buff someone's Physical Armor, those numbers are based on this skill (unless it's with a scroll), *including spells from other skills*. It also has infusions for your summon (Earth Infusion, and later Poison Infusion).\n\nI'm not saying dip into all of these (don't spread yourself too thin), but figure out which 1-3 is/are most important to you, and plan to nab them over time. 3 dips probably isn't feasible until way late in the game, and I wouldn't do 2 dips until I was well into Act 2. Think about which are easiest to live without and eliminate those - for example I usually don't pick Geomancer, I just buy Fortify scrolls instead.\n\nIf you choose an elemental skill and find you really like it and want more points in it (Hydro is probably most likely here), it will be worthwhile to make sure you're on wand and shield rather than weapon and shield. If you start loading points into Hydro, may as well use a Hydro wand and take advantage of them when you attack as well as when you cast spells.",

            "You need to forget about traditional tank and healing roles for this game. They will always be suboptimal. All your characters should be able to deal a good amount of damage. That doesn't mean you can't have a tank-like character or a character with healing capabilities, but those things are secondary. Due to how flexible to build system is, any character can end up with decent healing skills if you wish. Also, there aren't a lot of threat/aggro skills in the game anyway so a tank is useless in that sense. But you can still kick ass with a warrior build, especially with a 2-handed weapon. And you can still have a magical build specializing in Hydrosophist, having very good healing capabilities but also deal a lot of damage primarily.\n\nAny party combination can work, but I recommend either having a full party that deals either physical *or* magical damage, or a 50/50 split. Otherwise, you'll end up with three good characters but one character who's struggling to get through the enemies' physical or magical armor alone. \n\nIn combat, what's truly important are CC skills that make the enemy skip their turn. Your Knight for instance, should have skills like Battering Ram and Battle Stomp. Both those skills knock down enemies if they have no physical armor left. So focus on destroying the enemy's armor first before applying those kind of effects. Same goes for effects like frozen and stunned only you need to destroy enemies' magical armor first instead. If you have a Hydrosophist mage, they can make it rain to make enemies wet, and then use skills that apply frozen, or use Aerothurge skills that stun them (when enemies are wet and then shocked they become stunned).",

            "During the first act of the game, you can freely swap out companions whenever you like, so you can try them out do the early steps in their quests and such. You don\u2019t have to finalize your party until the interlude between Acts 1 and 2. They will level up to your level every time you re-recruit them, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them falling behind. \n\nDo be aware, though, that the first time you recruit each character, they will join the party at your current level with all of their character points chosen according to the class preset you select for them. (On subsequent recruitments, if they level up, you\u2019ll get to pick where the points go.) So if you do want to try them all out, it\u2019s a good idea to do the initial recruitment early. Alternatively, there\u2019s a trick where if you go through the recruitment dialog when you already have a full party, the game seems to register their initial recruitment level as 1, so if you come back to re-recruit them later when you have space, you\u2019ll get to pick everything from level 2 upwards. That\u2019s pretty nice because there\u2019s a civil ability point at L2 and a talent point at L3, and while you\u2019ll be able to freely respec after Act 1, it can be kind of a pain to have points assigned in useless categories, especially since the early game can be pretty hard.\n\nAs for whether you\u2019d like to do LW vs a full party, I think it depends on your goals. If you\u2019re mostly interested in the tactical aspects of the game, then LW gives you a lot more power and opens up more of the build space. If you\u2019re interested in the story elements, though, then running a full party will give you a richer experience. I also personally find the full-party combat to be more interesting in some ways due to the additional constraints. LW allows you to make fairly \u201cgeneralist\u201d builds (e.g. a mage who can use all of the elemental schools as needed), and because of the alternating turn order rules, your party\u2019s actions are very front-loaded in each combat round. I enjoy figuring out how I want to manage my party\u2019s turn order and comboing abilities across turns, but if that sounds tedious to you, then maybe LW is better.\n\nThe other thing to know is that the experience of playing an origin as your main is a bit different than having them as a companion. I have never played Ifan as my main, but I\u2019ve seen others saying that he shines more as a companion. I personally hated the Red Prince as a main, but he\u2019s grown on me as a companion. I\u2019ve seen people say that Fane and Lohse are fun to play as mains, I guess because their stories benefit more from seeing the internal view?",
            "You can Examine the enemies to check their resistances. You want to have a good mixture of CC since some CC is blocked by Physical armor and other CC is blocked by Magic Armor. Remove whichever one is lower from that enemy and slap some CC on them. It's usually good to have 2 physical damage characters and 2 magic ones if you have a full party. You can deal physical damage on a high intelligence character with Necro skills. As an example, the warfare tree has some good Knockdown skills which is blocked by physical and an enchanter with hydro and aero can stun enemies by making them wet and then applying shocked for a stun or chilled to freeze them which is blocked by magic armor. As for the blob fight, the Bless skill is your best friend. It can turn necro fire into normal fire and if you cast it on the normal fire before the blobs can change it back to necro, then it turns into blessed fire which will heal you.  You could cast rain on the normal fire to make steam and then bless it for blessed steam for healing. The healing of blessed surfaces will scale with the Hydro stat of whoever blessed it.  If you can apply the Decay debuff to the fire slimes then the fire will harm them instead of healing them. I hope this helps a little.",

            "No amount of build guides can prepare you for honor mode. I'd say there are 3 things that make the game easier for you: Builds, combat strategy and experience. The first one can be looked up, the second is highly individual, the last one only comes with time. You're going to either need all 3 for honor mode or an extremely high threshold for frustration as you're forced to restart over and over.\n\nAn experienced veteran can beat honor mode with only one character without Lone Wolf, even with suboptimal builds.\n\nOther player struggle at lower difficulties even with optimal build guides. That being said, while Fextralife builds aren't exactly unviable, they're definitely not optimal.\n\nI already wouldn't recommend Tactician to new players. That difficulty is balanced for players who've played the game before or are looking for a serious challenge and aren't easily frustrated. Honor mode takes that to a whole new level. This game has some fights that are very tough to beat if you don't know about their mechanics. Tactician makes it even more difficult to turn those fights around, and Honor makes it so a small mistake might cost you tens of hours of progress.\n\nThat being said, I don't know you. You might be an experienced RPG veteran or just really good at turn-based combat tactics, someone who doesn't give up easily. There are people who pick up the game, start in Honor mode, don't have to restart too often (or don't mind doing so) and have fun with it. If you start this game in honor mode and stick with it you just need to be prepared that you will most likely have to restart like 5-20 times and might not finish the game within several hundred hours of play.\n\nI'd suggest to jump into the game on Tactician and try to get to approx. level 6 or something to test out the difficulty of this game for yourself. At that point you won't be too far into the game and can still restart the game in Honor mode without too much of a time loss if you decide that that's the difficulty you want to play.",

And normally, whenever you inflict any electric damage to a target standing in a water or blood surface, you electrify that surface. And an electrified surface can only discharge, if the surface gets updated, which happens when someone moves through it and gets affected, or when the surface is altered (e.g.: blood is blaced in/by a water puddle).

            "For every builds, your attribute (STR/FIN/INT) is the biggest damage boost you have, just due to the large number of points you can put into it and how far you can boost it with gear. You need 30 points to max out your attribute, but even at level 21 you'll only have 43, which is absolutely not enough to invest into 2 separate attributes. \n\nAs such, every build without Lone Wolf can only really invest into one damage attribute and only use damage skills that use that attribute for scaling effectively. Spreading around your attribute points just means that all your damage will be shitty. Dipping into other abilities for utility skills on the other hand is very useful as scaling doesn't matter for them.\n\nScoundrel skills use Finesse for damage scaling. All kinds of magic use Intelligence for damage scaling. Unless you want to cut your damage in half, using both on the same character won't work out. You'll still be able to use any kind of magic skill that isn't a damage skill on your rogue effectively, so you can throw on things Chameleon Cloak, Evasion, Teleport, movement skills and stuff like that without issues.\n\nYou could also go Lone Wolf, which cuts your party size down to 2 in return for giving the remaining two characters double the stats. That essentially allows you to run two separate builds on the same character.\n\nAs for the other one, dedicated supports aren't very good in this game. You can make them work in a few specific ways, but they just aren't terribly effective. Let me elaborate on that:\n\nIn this game, combatants are protected by magical and physical armor. These function similar to HP and absorb a certain amount of damage. For example, physical damage depletes physical armor, and once that is gone all physical damage will damage HP instead. The most important aspect of armor however is that is prevents being afflicted by many negative status effects that can just disable your character for a round. Any character without armor is easy to stunlock and keep out of the fight entirely.\n\nAs such, healing is the least useful type of support you can have, even though there are a ton of healing skills in this game. Keeping up your allies' armor is much more important than restoring their HP - a character without armor that gets stunlocked might as well be dead. So a support's priority would be to get rid of CCs and regenerate armor.\n\nAs for armor regeneration, there aren't all that many good skills for that in the game. You could probably cast all of those skills that are actually good in one turn, after which they'll be on cooldown for 4-5 turns. You can't build a character dedicated to that with so few skills.\n\nAs for skills that remove CC, pooling them on one character is a horrible idea. Not only will you be unable to help if that character gets CCed, but that single character all that likely to take their turn before the afflicted ally would take theirs. As scaling for these skills is truly irrelevant and they're spread out across multiple combat abilities, it's much better to spread those skills around your team.\n\nThis brings me to the final point: Damage scaling in this game is massive - especially on higher difficulties. Your armor values, armor restoration and anything used to stay alive won't be able to keep up with that. For reference, a level 2 character has 45 HP and deals like 7 damage in a 2 AP attack. A level 21 character has around 3.5k HP (maybe 5-6k with armor), but can throw out attacks that deal more than 5k or even 10k damage. A necromancer might crit for 11k on a 1 AP AoE skill.\n\nThe more the game goes on, the better offense becomes as a defense. With those massive damage capabilities, you can just break your enemies' armor and take them out of the fight before they can do the same to you. As such, you're better off making an offensive character that takes pressure off your allies by taking out enemies, which prevents them from attacking you in the first place.\n\nThat being said, you can make a support character work in this game, even if a damage character would be more effective. Key to that would be the ability \"Leadership\" which grants elemental resistances and dodge chance to allies in your vicinity. If you max it out and then push it beyond the maximum using buffs from equipment you'll be able to provide a massive defensive buff to your allies. By the end of the game (assuming you can push Leadership with equipment by another 10 points) you'll give allies 60% magic resistances and a 40% chance to dodge attacks entirely. Though to be honest, that doesn't sound like a very fun character to play.",

If you want to, you can enable a gift bag (sort of a built-in mod) that gives you the ability to respec even in the early parts of the game, although that will disable achievements (unless you use some tools to re-enable them).\n\nBecause skills need to be bought from vendors, you will need to get enough gold to buy any new skills if you want to make significant changes to your builds. However, that's nothing a little bit of crime couldn't solve...",

They'll usually have a few wasted stats or skills, but you'll always find one that at least goes in the general direction that you'll want to take your build.\n\nOnce you leave the first island, you'll unlock the ability to respec and will be able to re-assign the last few stat remnants of the presets at that point.\n\nI should also mention that fextralife isn't all that great of a resource for builds for this game. While their content is certainly easy to digest, their builds are theme builds that often try to force some kind of gimmick to work, to the point where some of those builds are actually better off ignoring half of their kit. They have some decent knowledge of how the game works, but they don't use it to make good builds - they use it to take a fundamentally bad concept and turn it into a somewhat viable build.\n\nWhile I also don't think that it's necessary to adhere to some of the super optimized build guides that would be the alternative, I advise to take anything they say with a grain of salt. There are a portion of their builds that are easily fixed, but also some where the very core of the build just doesn't work out.

            "1. In general, the elements that give you an AoE damage skill are the best ones. You should take note of enemy resistances though and adapt your element choices to avoid high resistances. You can craft infusion skills by combining skillbooks of summoning with one of the 4 elemental magic types; that way you can switch through multiple elements in one combat and keep using their element-specific skills instead of waiting for the cooldown of those skills. Once you leave Act 1, you'll be able to find source skillbooks and craft source versions of those infusions. The Cursed Electric and the Necrofire infusions are probably the most powerful ones.\n2. Pyro/Geo doesn't have a lot of CCs, but makes up for it in damage. If you want reliable magic CC, you should go with Hydro/Aero. Be sure to use the Deploy Trap skills (crafted using Pyro + Huntsman skillbooks) which deal massive damage as long as you detonate the traps with your own skills and surfaces. The best CC you have available would require you to pick up the Torturer talent, which allows you to ignore armor for some specific status effects. The effects that you care about are that you can set people on fire despite their magic armor, and the fact that the Geo skill Worm Tremor now ignores magic armor as well. It's only really some form of Cripple, but being able to lock enemies in place without breaking their armor is still pretty good.\n3. Sparks builds focus on the skill Master of Sparks, which is a crafted Pyro + Warfare source skill. The non-source version is called Sparkstriker, and should only be used until you can craft Master of Sparks. They're buffs that shoot out \"sparks\" every time you hit enemies with weapons, and those sparks deal fire damage to nearby enemies. With Master of Sparks, you will be able to create multiple sparks on every enemy hit, so you can hit a bunch of enemies with an AoE Warfare skill and create a ton of secondary fire damage. You'll usually use a Staff as a weapon; that way your sparks and your weapon attacks will both deal magical damage and will both scale with INT IIRC.\n4. Sure.

Number in parentheses behind skills is the level at which they become available for purchase, though I might forget it for some of them or get them wrong as I'm doing it from memory.\n\n**General**\n\n* The basic combat strategy is simple: Break the enemy armor and apply a hard CC that prevents their turn before they can do significant damage to you. Thus, every character should deal good damage and have some CC options - even if those are just consumables.\n* Every character should have at least one jump skill, better 2 (especially the melee character). Those skills are: Cloak and Dagger, Phoenix Dive, Tactical Retreat. The ranged characters benefit from Huntsman, so they should probably take Cloak and Dagger and Tactical Retreat. The 2H Warrior already has warfare, so take Phoenix Dive instead of Tactical Retreat here.\n* Adrenaline is very useful. Most characters should have it if you have the stats to spare. Teleport is useful to have multiple times in your party, though probably not on everyone. It's especially useful on your warrior: You can make a nice combo by dropping one enemy on another and then hitting them both with Crippling Blow (which has a very tiny AoE but can hit multiple enemies right next to each other). The defensive utility skills I mentioned before are optional - add them when you feel like you need the extra defense.\n* Everyone should have either the Executioner or The Pawn talent. They're among the strongest talents out there, but mutually exclusive. Use Executioner on the characters that tend to kill people and The Pawn on those who don't. While Pawn might initially look useful on melee characters, it's actually also useful on mages to set up Elemental Affinity more easily (a talent that reduces AP cost for elemental spells if you're standing on the corresponding surface). Executioner is overall stronger though.\n* 5-Star-Diner is the strongest defensive talent, anyone could use it. You can respec into it later for tough fights, but it's not necessary in the beginning. It doubles the effect of consumables, turning 50% resistance/dodge potions into 100% resistance/dodge potions. It allows you to basically get immune against magic damage and weapon attacks using potions.\n* After the specially recommended talents for each build, fill the remaining slots with any of these talents: 5-Star-Diner, All Skilled Up, Hothead, Mnemonic, Bigger and BetterCivil Abi\n\n**2H Warrior**\n\n* Recommended Talents:\n   * Executioner. You already have Warfare.\n   * Hothead. Extra crit and you don't have a base chance of 5% to miss anymore\n   * Opportunist. Extra attacks I guess.\n   * Pet Pal. It's great for a first full playthrough, as animals can give you a lot of hints for quests. Once you know all those hints it's basically useless, except for 2 specific quests in Act 2. Pick this on your warrior, since you want your main character to be the guy who talks anyways.\n   * 5-Star-Diner. Elemental resistance is very useful for a melee character with low magical armor.\n* Civil Ability: Persuasion. This is your MC, so you should be able to talk well. Necessary in later acts for some quests. Max it, then put the rest into Bartering.\n* Recommended Skills\n   * Warfare: Battle Stomp, Battering Ram, Crippling Blow, Whirlwind(4), Phoenix Dive(9), Challenge(16), Onslaught(9)\n   * Polymorph: Bull Horns, Tentacle Lash, Chameleon Cloak, Chicken Claw, Skin Graft(9)\n   * Scoundrel: Adrenaline, Cloak and Dagger(4)\n   * Aerotheurge: Teleport(4), Evasion(4)\n\n**Archer**\n\n* Recommended Talents:\n   * Executioner\n   * Far Out Man\n* Civil Ability: Thievery. Thievery and Persuasion are the only required civil abilities - you need this one to pick locks, and stealing from merchants is the fastest way to make lots of money. I'd put it on the archer because gear the buffs Thievery usually requires Finesse to equip. You want to keep every piece of gear that buffs Thievery that you can find and equip it temporarily on this character to \"go shopping\".\n* Recommended Skills\n   * Huntsman: Pin Down, Ricochet, Marksman's Fang, Ballistic Shot (4), Barrage (4), First Aid, Elemental Arrowheads, Sky Shot(4), Assassinate (16), Arrow Spray (9) (only use on targets with huge hitboxes like Trolls).\n   * Scoundrel: Adrenaline, Cloak and Dagger(4)\n   * Polymorph: Chameleon Cloak, Skin Graft(9)\n* I recommend to craft/buy yourself additional Knockdown Arrows and Tremor Grenades. Archers have amazing single target damage, but are very lacking in hard CC.\n\nPart 1/2",

It's just that they decided to substantially decrease the chance to miss compared to other RPGs and instead buff HP (or in this case implementing armor) so that the duration of combat encounters remain the same. \n\n> Wouldn\u2019t the concept of armor replacing misses still work with a SINGLE armor system?\n\nYes, it would and I agree! I think a single armor system would be better in every way.",
            "If you haven't found it yet, there's a personal storage chest on the ship. When you are out exploring, no matter where you are, you can right click an item in your inventory and magically send it to the storage chest on the ship. Perfect mechanic for hoarders who pick up anything and everything. You have to teleport back to the ship to retrieve the stuff though.",
            "Welp, there you have your issue.\n\nA single level is a significant power increase. A lvl 14 enemy has 1.3 times the vitality and armour compared to a lvl 13 one with the exact same stats. Their damage increases in similar intervals.\n\nFighting something a single level higher than you requires careful planning. Two levels may not always be possible to overcome. Any more than that, and you gotta fully specialize your builds to fit the encounter, or know it well enough to also know how to break it.\n\nI'd recommend coming back to this a level later. Also, the only 'guard' who joins in the fight against you is the lizard who guards Sadha. All other enemies in that encounter 'de-stealth' when the combat begins (read: they spawn in).",
            "Part 2/2\n\n**Pyro/Geo Mage**\n\n* Recommended Talents:\n   * Elemental Affinity. Get this early and use it often to reduce AP of your expensive fire spells. There is a sweet spot where your foot is essentially on the surface and you get the talent's benefit but you're not taking surface damage yet.\n   * The Pawn or Executioner. Pawn can be helpful to get into the right position for elemental affinity without damaging yourself. But pyro deals a ton of damage, so Executioner would be a fine choice here as well - you'd have to waste a point into Warfare though to pick it.\n   * Far Out Man\n   * Savage Sortilege. Mandatory pick at level 13. If you're not using crits in the late game your damage will suck.\n   * Torturer can be a good pick for a Pyro/Geo mage, but it'll ruin your Aero/Hydro mage. Recommended for this build in general, but not in this party.\n* Civil Ability: Let's go with Loremaster here. 3rd most useful talent - it allows you to identify higher quality loot and shows you more detailed stats of enemies when you inspect them. You can see their elemental resistances at Loremaster 1 (very useful) and their initiative at Loremaster 5 (also very useful). Anything between or above doesn't really matter.\n* Recommended Skills\n   * Pyro: Ignition (use early game, drop it later) Searing Daggers (Good to set up elemental affinity with one of your shots), Fireball(4), Laser Ray (9), Fire Whip(9), Spontaneous Combustion (4), Peace of Mind, Haste, Epidemic of Fire (9)\n   * Geo: Impalement(4), Fossil Strike, Fortify, Poison Dart, Earthquake(4), Pyroclastic Eruption (16) (this is the most powerful magic damage skill out there, can instantly win you entire fights).\n   * Hybrid (crafted by combining 2 skillbooks): Throw Explosive Trap (Pyro + Huntsman), Deploy Mass Traps (Pyro + Huntsman, one of them a source skill). These are the most powerful Pyro skills out there. Just make sure you detonate your traps yourself, either by throwing them into your own fire surfaces or by throwing another AoE skill like Fireball or Fossil Strike on it.\n   * Scoundrel: Adrenaline, Cloak and Dagger (4)\n   * Huntsman: Tactical Retreat (4)\n* I recommend to get some magic CC grenades like Love or Terror grenades on this one later on. Pyro/Geo doesn't have much CC, but really good damage instead.\n\n**Hydro/Aero Mage**\n\n* Recommended Talents\n   * Elemental Affinity\n   * Pawn or Executioner\n   * Far Out Man\n   * Savage Sortilege: Mandatory at lvl 13\n* Civil Ability: Lucky Charm. You could go with Bartering if you always want to switch to a different character to trade, but I've always found that to be too much of a hassle.\n* Recommended Skills\n   * Aero: Electric Discharge, Dazing Bolt, Teleport (4), Evasion (4), Chain Lighting (9), Nether Swap (13), Superconductor (9), Pressure Spike (13), Thunderstorm (16) Tornado (16, useful utility to remove Necrofire and Deathfog later on)\n   * Hydro: Armour of Frost, Rain, Restoration, Hail Strike, Ice Fan(4), Winter Blast (4), Clobal Cooling (13)\n   * Hybrid: Vacuum Touch (Aero + Necro)\n   * Scoundrel: Adrenaline, Cloak and Dagger (4)\n   * Huntsman: Tactical Retreat (4)\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that you could also combine your mages' elements differently and use Pyro/Hydro and Geo/Aero as builds. That makes each individual build slightly weaker, but greatly increases their synergy. Pyro and Hydro don't mix well, and by putting them on the same character you don't have to use both of them each round.",
            "There's a decent mod that makes it so there is only one armour system. I enjoyed it. It was my third play-through though so never actually finished - believe I got to act 4. Made physical + magical party a lot more fun though. Give it a whirl.",
            "I got you.  And there\u2019s give and take with the system right. With Minimal misses I have a much better idea of the reasons behind my damage numbers. Very satisfying.  For contrast I am maybe 30 hours into pillars of eternity Deadfire and I still don\u2019t understand why the game will tell me my hit rate on an attack is 100% but then I miss.  Frustrating.  \n\nOn the flipside without misses I can\u2019t build my parry riposte Rogue from pillars who focuses on maximizing dodge chance which a chance to auto counter on misses.  \n\nThis aligns to your point about battles becoming formulaic.  Which never bothered me either in Divinity but there\u2019s a case to be made.",
            "Thanks for the info. I'll come back to it later.",
            "You should also make sure you have the correct leveled gear for your fights. If you're level 13 and are still using level 10 gear then your armor will reflect that. Also make sure you're maxing wits so you can go first. by making yourself go first you can cc the person that goes second which means you get 2 turns in a row. If all of your allies can cc someone on turn 1 you can get 4 turns in a row. Greatly increasing your odds of winning.\n\nInitiative works like this.\n\nSay your highest has 50 initiative and enemy highest has 40 initiative.\n\nYou will go first \nEnemy will go second.\nAlly.\nEnemy.\nAlly.\nEnemy.\n\nEven if the initiative of the enemies all are higher then your allies because of the round robin system you don't have to worry about having higher initiative then all the enemies. Just one person has to have the highest. This lets you chain cc enemies that are next on the turn order to force your team to get multiple turns"

I've reached act 3 playing with another friend of mine on classic at the moment, played at least half a dozen abandoned games with others over the years reaching around start of act 2, and I'm interested in trying out the harder difficulty (while my friend is not) for a second playthrough as classic is a bit easy. I'm east coast USA, EST/EDT time zone, and have dnd sessions middle of day wednesday/thursday and evening sunday, otherwise I am free almost any other time and highly flexible other than sharing time with my ongoing pre-existing DOS2 playthrough.\n\nWhile I'd like to not go crazy diverging from the default game with mods, I'm also not a purist or anything and would like to use some of the Gift Bag features: Source Meditation, Animal Empathy, Crafters Kit, Divine Talents, Enhanced Spirit Vision, Fort Joy Magic Mirror, Sourcerous Sundries, Pet Power, and Endless Runner of course. I find the game more enjoyable played with them. I'd also like to run at least 1 outside mod that significantly increases civil point gain, because lone wolf does not boost them and on top of that it is tedious to always be running back to the mirror or only have 1 person able to do anything effectively or have to stash a half dozen pieces of equipment with skill boosts to switch for a check. We can also discuss any other mods you would like to use.\n\nI'm planning to play either Sebille or custom elf as a ranger/huntsman/archer build, so with elemental arrows it should be able to play relatively nicely with a partner dealing magical or physical damage, but I'd prefer for us to play different archetypes at least (ie just not another archer lol).\n\nNot interested in cheesing anything with barrelmancy, setting up tons of bodies to corpse explode, stuff like that. Pre-positioning, pre-buffing, entering combat at different times, launching a pre-emptive attack, basic strategies like that are cool.\n\nTried to give as much general sense as I could with all that but if it sounds appealing, shoot me a friend request/message on discord (my tag is Mosaic#1123) and we can chat more about it.",
