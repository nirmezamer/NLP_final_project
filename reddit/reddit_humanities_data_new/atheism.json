I grew up deep in the church, I have always been very knowledgeable in the Bible, and I just made my way into atheism as I got older. But my friend, is unwavering in hood faith. \n\nNow, he\u2019s completely aware that there are contradictions and fallacies in the Bible, because he understands that men wrote the book. He\u2019s aware of the council of Nicea, and how so many other books didn\u2019t make it into the canon. His rationale is that, the point of faith is that 1.) with physical, undeniable, incontrovertible evidence, faith becomes moot, and \u201cfree will\u201d is invalidated l; and 2.) a lot of the stories and teachings are parabolic, not to be taken literally.\n\nIt should be noted that he is not bigoted, and is accepting of the LGBTQ community. We have had oh so many discussions and debates about this. We\u2019re so diametrically opposed on this issue, while we both accept that we\u2019re never going to chance each other\u2019s minds. He is aware of the inconsistencies, but is adamant that it\u2019s by design, to really test your faith. But he\u2019s happy, and that\u2019s what matters. \n\nI do love the dude, and I love that we can have those conversations while respecting each other\u2019s beliefs (or lack thereof). \n\nHe\u2019s also wary of people who try and force their beliefs onto people, as well as people who are so public with their beliefs.",

            "Lots of ppl question if jesus returned from the dead. But it\u2019s the cornerstone of Christianity that actions on earth matter because the Bible asserts you have an immortal soul that continues after death. The New Testament\u2019s message of rising from the dead was a mechanical means via story to demonstrate actions matter beyond physical presence on earth. The net question to reduce it down, do your actions in life have consequences beyond what man can put upon you for ramification? If we don\u2019t have an immortal soul and our actions don\u2019t matter beyond our physical presence, that leaves us only limited by our individual conscious to govern our actions. Science asserts a persons conscious is a blank slate at birth and requires the passing of generational knowledge to shape what a person feels about their behaviors. Ironically, the Bible is just that, a means to pass generational knowledge to shape and govern behavior. The family unit traditionally passes the generational knowledge but with both parents typically working to achieve and sustain material possessions such as food, clothing and shelter, the family unit is questionably affective. We should be very grateful to have the rise of the federal government as stewards of our generational knowledge to shape our individual conscious for future generations since the family unit and religion are no longer viable mechanisms.",
