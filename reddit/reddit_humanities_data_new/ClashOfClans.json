            "For strong heros you need both ores and upgraded heros. The tricky part here is that war is a large source for ores (one of the very few sources). It's annoying that you are in a major disadvantage when upgrading your heros during war. Grinding for ores and grinding for hero levels are both major aspects of the game and are currently separated by war. Imo, now after the equipment update, SC should do something about the 2 separate grinds and bring them more together",
            "Just don't upgrade your heroes and buy pots with raid medals. \n\nUpgrade heroes for what?",
            "I'm in th14 almost max and I was done with the hero upgrading in 2 months(f2p) when i reached th14, i did all the GW upgrade with books and hammer",
            "I am about to max my Th14 (f2p) and I never felt this was a major issue. I mostly use books for warden and queen whereas I don't find much problem in keeping RC and King down sometimes.\n\nOn my Th12 account I put 2 of my heroes for upgrade constantly still I am able to 3 star 80% of the time after the massive nerf at TH12. I am able to do LaLo with just the Queen Charge without the Warden and the King.\n\nThis may seem like an absurd thought but actually putting 1 or 2 of your heroes down can push you to better strategize so that their absence isn't much of an issue.",
            "It will be worth it when they get maxed",
            "I feel you. I let my heroes get behind (they are maxed now) but it took 20 months to max then. I maxed my queen first and I wasn\u2019t able to use her for 9 months to get her from lvl 45 to maxed.\n\nI was trying to upgrade them all at once but as a casual player it\u2019s not possible to earn the resources to keep them all down at higher lvls.\nWarden was the second hero to max due to it being a different resource.",

I max my heroes, they raise the level, they add new heroes, they add pets - all yours for the small price of thousands of dollars, or you could just wait....and wait....and wait....  \nIt is nothing more than a business model trying to get you to use real money. No thanks.",
            "I just don\u2019t upgrade them anymore and they\u2019ve been stuck at around th12.5 kind of levels even though my defenses are almost maxed hahaha. \nI\u2019m still able to 3 star bases in Legends league because of the equipments so I just found upgrading them as almost useless.",
            "It looks like there\u2019s an event coming up soon where they will be testing hero use while upgrading. Also with equipment you really don\u2019t need to stress about hero level too much. I basically only level my heroes with books but their equipment is maxed and when I use hero potions it helps but not enough to make me put heroes down for months lol. Just play how you want to play you can enjoy the game without completely maxed hero\u2019s as long as they\u2019re not stupid far behind. In a real crunch I\u2019ll use hero potions during cwl but like I said 10-15 levels behind but with maxed equipment and my attacking is pretty great I\u2019m not gonna ruin my enjoyment for months for a slight edge",

            "I just don\u2019t upgrade heroes after TH14 besides books from the pass/clan games. The dps increase is very minimal at high levels and equipment matters way more anyway.

            "Let me ask you this, why do you have to upgrade heroes. I used all my 6 builders on buildings only. We go to war 2 times a week and I spend 300 raid tokens to get the hero potions. During the clan wars we need 7 so it's like 3 every week which is not so bad. I also use my training potion during this time and do lots of multiplayer battles. The rest of the time without hero potions I just use a spam army like gowitch or electro dragon to farm resources.",
            "War for a month and then upgrade all your heroes the next month, rinse and repeat.. thats how i do it",
            "I just recommend something what if each hero you upgrade will give you some few ores cause hero equipments are expanding at fast rate and epic equipments really cost alot of ores so that people will still engage to upgrade heroes anymore cause for me upgrading heroes are useless now since what the point it's because of few HP and DPS back in the days we're upgrading heroes because we also upgrade there abilities but now nuh uh it takes you really long ages just to upgrade a specific hero",

            "as a th14, you don't need all 4 heroes to 3* a base using super archer blimp and then hydra. Of course having heroes makes it easier and makes u able of hitting a wide variety of bases, but if you dont, just search for compact bases and you are fine",
            "Past 8days upgrade times sure, but before that it makes no sense",
            "This is why supercell is so adamant about having us use heroes while upgrading, and I am not giving up to their greed.\u00a0\nI rather skip CWs and work on my heroes. Sure I will miss out on ores but at this point I just have to max the epics and I am anyway unable to use my heroes outside of CWL",

            "Yeah it does. Books only stack if bought, so if people are waiting until hero upgrades exceed 8 days before using them, they won\u2019t be able to use the books from events or silver/gold pass. I\u2019d rather be able to use all of my heroes constantly.",
