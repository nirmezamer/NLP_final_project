        "content": "Below are some FAQs and some helpful notes for beginners. Feel free to add anything in the comments.\n\n# **FUT CHAMPS** \n\n**1)** You play rivals to earn fut champs points. \n\n\n**2)** You can use those points to gain entry to champ qualies. Here you have 10 games to get 20 points. 4 points for a win and 1 point for a loss so that's 4 wins, winning 4 will reward you with a finals entry token. This can be done at anytime during the week. If the season ends and you havent finished your qualies you'll lose your progress.\n\n\n**3)** On the weekend you can redeem your finals token. Here you have 20 games to get as many wins as possible\n\n\n**4)** once the games are over you repeat the process. Depending on your win bracket you can skip step 1.\n\n\nExtra - You can only enter finals once a week. If you don't use your token you can save it for a future week. \n\n\n# **WHEN TO OPEN PACKS**\n\nOpen when you want, it's all luck, if the current contents of the packs interest you then open them, if not then don't.\n\n\n# **RED EVO**\nThis is purely a cosmetic item. You should choose whoever you want.\n\n# **XP**\nXp is only earnt via objectives or rivals rewards, champs finals and squad battles rewards. Usually towards the end of the season they release more XP. Best way to find out it's to wait. XP can also occasionally be bought via select packs or kits.\n\n# **WHO TO PICK**\nUse something like futbin or futwiz to check a players price, this usually gives a rough idea in who's better. If they're not worth much and none help your squad take the highest rated for fodder. If they're all similarly price take whoever helps your team.\n\n# **HOW PEOPLE GET GOD SQUADS**\nThese recent fifas are very easy. The game throws fodder at you with the season progress. There's also a crazy amount of packs available in rivals, champs, qualies and squad battles aswell as objectives and milestones. We also have plenty of sbcs to get more packs, fodder and players\n\n# **WHERE IS COMPENSATION**\nIts EA,  nobody know when they'll release compensation \n\n# **NOT RECEIVING SQUAD BATTLE POINTS** \nCheck the top right and see how many matches you played. You get 32 matches a week, unplayed matches count as played when you refresh. You can still play and earn progress to challenges and objectives but you won't receive any squad battle points until the refresh\n\n# **SEASON 7 LADDER PLAYERS** \nThese are the players from the season progress.\n\n# **NEW LOAN TYPE** \nThese new loans are based of time and not games. They will expire once the Euros is over. Currently they are bugged and inly last 7 games but that will be fixed(applying contracts on the app seems to be a workaround)",

For reference I\u2019m at level 24 and I\u2019ve done every xp objective other than the Spain frenzy cup including the icon kits as well. Plus he has the Nuno Mendes card, which like Enzo, is locked behind 11 wins in champs with a pure Argentina squad. Everyone has a good team now but that guy clearly plays all day with how far in the pass he is and because he has Nuno first day.",

You can also use 40k coins to get the Flashback icon kit obj done. Thats another 2k xp.\n\nI was lvl 15 few days ago and just used last few days to grind these objectives. Im lvl 26 now. Ofcourse you get bit xp from wl, rivals and sb. But the biggest xp farm comes from objectives.",

            "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the biggest but it is definitely the one of the biggest. Community for the most part is backwards, someone celebrating a goal is toxic but posts like this? Naaah it\u2019s all good",

            "I could lol...not played since Feb, I still have coins. My point is I haven\u00b4t grinded for 3 months and I can still match that team after one evening with a few million coins...Its not a team full of the most expensive cards, its not that special.",
            "I\u00b4ve got a few mil...",
            "I don\u00b4t mean it literally...I\u00b4ve got 4 mil, I can challenge that team after one evening. My point is, its not that special.",
            "4 mil. You think I can\u00b4t match that?",
            "Tbf I'm not able to really play online, so rivals, weekend league and half of the friendly xp is just impossible for me to get. I do make sure to get all the throwback objs done though, I've only got one left from that",

            "If you see it like that sure. For me it's no more of a grind than playing normally as you're playing 20 games either way, just something different in the staleness of everyone using the same teams and getting the same utots red picks.",
            "Check in the friendlies tab bro it should be there",
            "The friendlies that have objectives tied to them are usually max chemistry",
            "Just goes to show how quick peeps are to jump to the \u2018cc fc\u2019 insult\u2026 it\u2019s about as far from a \u2018credit card\u2019 team as you can get \ud83d\ude02 5 of the cards are free, 3 of them fall in that 100-200k bracket cost wise and the others? Hardly bank breakers.",
            "For once this actually isn't credit card. Virtually all of those are objectives and SBCs. He's committed and quite good to be able to get fekir, Enzo send nunes but he can't have bought this team... he may have done his normal team admittedly",
            "That\u2019s irrelevant. Some of these cards you simply can\u2019t obtain anymore or it takes longer than you said due to the challenges (Bernardo silva)",
            "Yeah not playing online really makes you miss big amount of xp you can get unfortunately",
            "Guessing you're on console so don't have the online subs? Or you don't like playing online?",
            "You must've missed earlier objectives then. Or havent played champs or rivals at all. Those gives you like 2 levels per week.",
            "Yeah, this team is fully earned through gameplay and menu grind. Instead of the \u2018credit card fc\u2019 name, I would assume people would call it a \u2018no life team\u2019 and that the player needs to touch grass\n\nEdit: completely missed that OP put \u2018touch grass fc\u2019 in their post",
            "Nope, on pc, but long story short if I play online I have about a second of input delay so its just not worth my time",
            "What region you in? If you're near me, we can boost friendlies and knock them all off.\n\nBut I'm on PS, so won't be able to confirm I matched with you before entering a game.",
            "I'm on EU, but it's very difficult to do so. If it's just free wins you're talking about then you'll have to wait ten seconds after you pause before leaving to essentially wait for my game to catch up. I'm in Div 9 because of how little I play, so if I play rivals for evos, I kugjt go two or three goals up before they quit, but they quit before the game can register that they quit, so I just get a \"match result currently under review\" which means it recognises I played a game, but not that I won or lost"
