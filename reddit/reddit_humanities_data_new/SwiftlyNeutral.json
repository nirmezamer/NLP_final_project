            "Something I've been thinking about is how much people want to be 'right' about Taylor. I think some of this is Taylor's fault for gamifying things (but never her personal life). It's just interesting to see when I and others could not care less about that side of her fame.",
            "I find Kayleigh Teller to be very strange.",
            "I saw folks sharing their own lists here of tracks they like and I never fully felt like I could do that yet. So far, I streamed the anthology 15 times now (long commute) and the only fully developed cohesive standouts are:\n\n- Guilty As Sin?\n- The Manuscript\n- loml\n- Peter\n- Robin\n- Clara Bow\n\nMost of the album is now forgotten or not enjoyable at this point. I just took these out in a separate album and stream them.",
            "Again with the paternity test about The Black Dog all over this fandom. I actually once cared about this, but now I'm just so over it. Matty doesn't care about Taylor, he's engaged. Joe possibly cares even less. Travis is just shaking it off. If she's sending signs she's just being a fool, which I don't believe she is actually.\u00a0\n\n\nTo me personally she's playing swifties as fools because she knows people will try to decode songs that sometimes just go well together. Swifties are just doing a huge favor by streaming the songs 25251717 more times to discover hidden meanings and some think it's Joe, others are sure it's Matty, some have entire thesis it's even Kylie, a minority believe it's Harry Styles and everyone swear they have better evidence. It's honestly exhausting at this point.\u00a0",
            "That fire video was too funny! I\u2019m glad nothing bad happened and everyone was okay. \n\nAlso cat crumbs! I love seeing her cats",

            "The fandom is going to be Insufferable this weekend and I\u2019m equally \ud83d\ude2c\ud83c\udf7f",
            "I miss the sub when it was on private lol\n\nLike I like this place because it is neutral. But when you have people from that sub just piling on - it's hard to engage when you know it's not a good faith discussion. \n\nAnd I find it hard to take the person seriously when they rail about the stupidity of swifties and then proceed to display the same behaviour and spread misinformation to suit their own narratives. It's beyond weird to hate someone so much you post about her endlessly in snark subs AND pop culture subs",
            "I had a friend who\u2019s a huge Swiftie in my car for a long ride and she played mostly recent Taylor. I didn\u2019t realize just how repetitive some of her rhymes are and how she repurposes some lyrics. I still enjoy her music but this is why I can\u2019t listen to a playlist of her recent works.",
            "I think there was a post about this earlier. But I\u2019m very sick of the \u201cx city won.\u201d Feels like she just uses the same 5 base songs to match with others",
            "I\u2019m kinda excited to see the surprise songs over the next few days! Not from like a \u201clore\u201d perspective but I\u2019ve been really enjoying the mashups she\u2019s been doing recently. It\u2019s interesting to see how she uses her own works creatively",
            "I didn\u2019t care for Gracie\u2019s collab with Taylor. I saw Aaron was producing it so I got excited. Even without Taylor, the song wasn\u2019t interesting but it was one of those features where the featuring artist didn\u2019t add anything special to the song. She was literally just there.",
            "I'm a Woodvale truther, so therefore I tried my hand at creating my own Woodvale playlist featuring songs from Midnights and TTPD (+ Safe & Sound... tracklist spoiler?) I don't think this is the final version, but here's at least the first try if anyone wants to take a look \ud83d\ude0a.\n\n\n\n\n1. Would've, Could've, Should've\n2. The Great War\n3.

            "She did NOT just combine the bridges of Hits Different and DBATC \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d and then The Black Dog x Come Back\u2026 Be Here x Maroon?? London you won so bad",
            "Has anyone seen the new Taylor/scooter documentary that just came out? Is there anything new or is it just all rehashed stuff?",
            "is she actually in the cleaning cart right before she goes on stage or is that a joke swifties made up??",
            "ttpd (the title track) i used to consider one of taylor's worst songs ever. now it's among my absolute faves \ud83d\ude42",
            "Us fucking slaps, and is one of the best bridges she\u2019s ever been attached to. Plus, it\u2019s fascinating to hear Taylor Swift get the Taylor Swift feature treatment for the most part",
            "I came across the but daddy I love him performance on YouTube and I\u2019m thinking.. am I the only one who finds it insulting (couldn\u2019t think of a better word?) that she points at the audience as she sings *I just learned these people only raise you to cage you* I meannnn\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d this isn\u2019t a subtle shade anymore.\n\nEdit: deleted the last sentence",
            "I love the collab with gracie and the video gracie posted on instagram where taylors extinguishing the fire on the counter is very sweet :)",
            "Thought I'd post this here to get people's thoughts\n\nI traveled down to Cardiff for The Eras Tour and when I was asked by people I met why I was in town, I would tell them it's for Taylor Swift and the response was always the same. They intend no disrespect to her but they just don't get it. They don't see what's so popular about her, how she can fill stadiums and have fans queue up for hours/miles just to see her. They acknowledge that she's talented and good at what she does but good enough to have the fandom she does? They didn't get it\n\nPersonally, I think it's 50% her talent and 50% her marketing team. Apple make great phones but there are other phones that are just as good for a fraction of the price but they don't have the marketing Apple do",
            "I know this is a Reddit-wide problem and not a this sub specific issue, but when I get downvoted into the negatives for ranking my personal list of favorite to least favorite of Taylor\u2019s albums, I start missing when this sub was private. \ud83d\ude2d",
            "That was really nice of Taylor and Travis to invite their families all the way to London when they definitely broke up weeks ago because their PR contract ended (for the 53rd time in 6 months). \n\n\ud83e\udd45",
            "playing 2 songs about ratty mashed up with come back\u2026 be here WITH HER BF IN THE AUDIENCE is wild behavior",
            "I thought with Travis actually being at the show we\u2019d be spared the \u2018Matty-coded\u2019 \u2018sending signals/messages\u2019 surprise songs discourse, but alas it has now shifted to \u2018I can\u2019t believe she played these songs in front of Travis, she wants Matty back!!1!\u2019 \ud83d\udc80. \n\nLike why is he allowed to move on but she isn\u2019t? Did Taylor get custody of the Maylor shippers in the divorce?",
            "Hi there - just saying I\u2019m thankful this sub exists after being bullied repeatedly in the main sub for suggesting the book with US written on the cover could have be a The Story of Us reference (in addition to Gracie Abrams).\n\nI\u2019m more of a lurker, just wanted to post here a few times in case this sub decides to go private again so that I can get approved. \ud83d\udc4b",
            "Gracie\u2019s new album is fantastic and Us is beautiful. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s getting the shine she deserves, she\u2019s a very talented young woman.",
            "I'm a swiftie since Speak Now and Midnights was my least favorite album of hers. So when TTPD came out, I was excited to hear it. I tried to love it, but after a week of the release, I couldn't. It feels like a jumbled word salad.\n\nEverything sounds the same until I hear people making an AI cover of Olivia Rodrigo singing \"I Hate It Here\" on tiktok. It sounds so good that I tried to relisten to TTPD again, but my initial thoughts remained the same.\n\nIt makes me so confused how even Taylor's \"I Hate It Here\" sounds like bland chicken to me, someone who has been Taylor's fan for so long, but the same song and lyrics sound so good in a different voice (unfortunately, in this case, AI, which is unethical and scary af)",

            "Yall think we\u2019re getting a run and kiss staged moment this weekend?",
            "Regarding who the Black Dog may be about \u2014 didn\u2019t Jack post a pic of the day she recorded it at ELS? Wasn\u2019t she wearing those flowery jeans? Was that before her breakup with Matty? If so, then that means she wrote the song before she broke up with Matty and it\u2019s more likely to be about Joe. Unless Jack is lying and trolling lol I still feel like it\u2019s a Joe inspired song.",
            "Anyone watching the new Max documentary about the Scooter Braun masters issue?? What are your thoughts? \n\nPersonally, I think it makes it very clear that Taylor very intentionally played the victim in this situation and lied to mislead her fans and the media to gang up on Big Machine, Scott, and Scooter. And apparently their families. \n\nI\u2019m curious if this will open anyone\u2019s eyes or what the response from Taylor or her fans will be.",
            "I\u2019m disappointed Travis and his crew showed up today. I was really hoping this nonsense would be over by now. Like please bring back the time before I knew this man existed.",
            "She\u2019s been playing maroon pretty frequently in her mash ups - I wonder why? Going to sound parasocial and she can do what she wants obviously it\u2019s her songs but I\u2019m just more inclined to think that there\u2019s some truth about her sending secret messages in her acoustic songs \u00a0\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u00a0\n\njust my thoughts because she just played maroon recently and she has hundreds of songs to choose from, so it seems \u201cstrange\u201d? (not sure if that\u2019s the correct word), that she\u2019ll choose to play it again so soon, and her choice of acoustic songs do seem to somehow reflect what\u2019s going on usually!",
            "Where can I watch today's performance live online?",
            "What I think is that :  just Maybe Taylor called the entire brigade down to London because it matches well with the documentary release and does something just to drown out all the noise of the documentary.",

            "I have a feeling that this was meant to hit TTPD and didn't so Gracie used it for her album. \nOn the other note , I was very disoriented with the Lyrical Video and just like you didn't care for the song. I thought a lot was happening at the same time.",

My brain is also screaming at me to include The Archer, so that'd be included as well.\u00a0\n\n\nI was additionally tempted to add Sweet Nothing, Mastermind, and Dear Reader, but I feel like the songs above allow for an E.P. with a focus on sleepless nights reflecting on failed and/or toxic relationships (so... basically the original Midnights concept lolll.)",

Or like you thought it was the cat just knocking something over and you also knew you had a candle burning and didn\u2019t immediately think your kitchen might be on fire?\u201d\n\nMy brain would have immediately, even drunk, been like OMG what if it was the candle and assumed my house was gonna burn down and checked on it right away.

Why does it require more of an explanation? Lots of people have an artist that they\u2019re a die hard fan of, that they would follow on tour to another country/continent and no one questions them. When people lined up to see End Game I didn\u2019t question why they love Marvel so much. I thought that\u2019s fun that they have something to be excited about and want to line up for. Why can\u2019t people just feel the same way for us? \n\nI hate to call misogyny, but I can\u2019t see another explanation, no one has to explain why they followed KISS or AC/DC on their world tours or why they lined up all night to see the first screening of End Game, or showed up 5 hours early to tailgate for their favorite football team. It\u2019s only stereotypical female interests that get questioned like this. I\u2019m questioned about liking Taylor Swift or lining up for the new Twilight movie back in 2010 to see a first screening, or enjoying the Barbie movie, or questioned if I *actually* like the sport I\u2019m watching and know the rules.",
            "no offense, but i think that 50% talent is being a bit generous. 75% of this success is because of her marketing, this is the culmination of almost 20 years of laying the seeds",
            "I think nostalgia plays a huge part, and the recent late-millennial desire to reconnect with girlhood. Everyone I know, whether they were fans or not, grew up with Taylor. She was the soundtrack of middle/high school. Being able to go back to that time with a perspective of love and joy can be really fun and empowering. Some people are even now able to share that with their own little girls. That sort of energy is contagious!",
            "There's a lot of random downvoting even for perfectly harmless takes.\u00a0\nYesterday a few minutes after every single comment I was downvoted. Ridiculous to say I guess this but felt like was being shadowed /trolled\u00a0",

But she actually played it in London; but then she also threw in Maroon at the end. Then she also added 'come back be here' with the I guess you're in New York today' verse which people could interpret as Joe.\n\nSo while fans argue about muses, there is so much engagement for a tour that has crossed 100 shows! The surprise song mashups is what is keeping the Eras Tour fresh for most of us1\n\nEdit : But more or less in the recent shows she uses the mashups to tell a story arc too :like Cornelia Street- Maroon; or Great War- You're Losing Me- I survived the Great War.   Black Dog- come back, be here and Maroon",

The sweatshirt she was wearing earlier is on the back of the couch\n\nSo yeah it was def recorded after she & Matty broke up. The location of the actual bar is debated though. But there are enough other things that point to it being about Matty IMO - he's a smoker (Joe isn't), the Starting Line being one of his favorite bands and he covered their song, he tends to hook up with younger girls, etc.\n\nAlso the narrative in the song lines up with Matty ghosting her. The Black Dog is sung from the perspective of someone who can't understand why the person who has left her doesn't miss her at all... and that just doesn't line up with what she's told us about how things ended with Joe.

Maybe she meant she found out that it actually happened at that time or whatever, but to me it seems like she was trying to say she had no idea this was happening, which really isn\u2019t the case. \n\nI don\u2019t know the details of the deals they were trying to negotiate. Maybe they weren\u2019t real legitimate offers, but it seems like she had other opportunities to buy them for the right price. \n\nOn the death threats - I mean I agree that no one should be making or encouraging others to make threats. But it goes like way beyond okay to target someone\u2019s kids. Seems like an opportunity to be the bigger person, but maybe I\u2019m expecting too much. \n\nAnd I also agree Scooter seems scummy and def not like a great person. But at the end of the day, he made a business deal that he was legally allowed to make.\n\nI think Taylor just used the whole situation to make herself more successful, so they both benefitted",

Jason for the 22 hat!",

Taylor's own father made millions out of the sale so to also claim you had no idea the sale had happened until the public knew has to be taken with a grain of salt.. If she didn't like the terms of her contract, she should never have signed it.",
            "I absolutely agree that I think Taylor benefited from the situation. The eras tour and the re-recordings are basically feeding each other at this point. \n\nBut there was no way she could have known that in 2019.  And when Taylor spoke out, she even had some exec from Big Machine telling her on Twitter that her \"shine\" was off - basically that she was on the decline. Taylor herself thought Lover was it and that's that. \n\nI mean Scooter got backlash on Twitter but it was nothing compared to 2016 snakegate so I guess she could have been the bigger person, but then again I can see why she chose not to. I remember when the sale happened, Scooter's friends congratulated him for \"buying\" Taylor swift.\n\nI do agree that it's possible that she was playing with language tho! What I took at the time was that she knew it was going to be sold, she didn't know it would be sold to Scooter.",

People who follow American football over here (and I am one of them) need to stay up until the stupid hours of the morning to follow it, no one under 14 is doing that and very few - even over 14 - even want to.",
            "Nice to see a photo of Taylor with a guy whose entire existence seems to be based around shamelessly chasing clout and demanding the public\u2019s attention despite the public\u2019s rapid declining interest in him and loss of patience with this \u201cI am famous because I am famous\u201d mindset. \n\nAnd the royals are there too.",

At least an Instagram post she can always delete if they break up, although if it were me and I wanted to make it Instagram official with my boyfriend I'd use a photo only of the two us as the first one and certainly not a photo with the future king of the UK. \n\nIt'll feel quite disrespectful if she ends up deleting the photo and if she doesn't she'll be forced to keep an ex on her Instagram feed (which I'm guessing it's not something she'd feel comfortable with considering that she even deleted the reel in which she was talking about the meaning behind lavender haze just because she had vaguely mentioned Joe).",
            "Nah she\u2019ll just write a song or album about it. She used to do the same stuff or at least similar stuff with Calvin and look at how that ended. She constantly posted Calvin on her IG. I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019ll regret Travis being in a picture with her and the Royals. And based off the pic The Royals posted, there\u2019s some pics of them without Travis. Not entirely a big deal. I think her mentioning him in her POTY article when she was only dating him 3 months will be more of a regret if they ever do break up,",

            "The British media is so pathetic and embarrassing",
            "Bingo. She attended the Eras tour in LA and didn\u2019t get a selfie as far as we know. 100% this will be spun into another battle in the idiotic British media obsession with her. And I agree on Prince William.",

            "It must be a depressing disaster of a day on certain subs.",
            "I think she put the jacket on to cover up the bodysuit because it\u2019s a bit more appropriate for posing with royalty, particularly kids. Meeting royals and the optics are quite strict.\n\nETA- nothing wrong with the bodysuit at all, but royal stuff is quite old fashioned in attitudes.",
            "Before the show. She may have put it on out of respect or didn\u2019t feel comfortable meeting them in just her bodysuit. Could also be a dress protocol thing?",
            "She probably put the jacket on to take the pics with them. Not saying her bodysuit is inappropriate by any means, but they\u2019re Royals lol. It looks like before the show. Her hair and makeup look fresh and untouched.",

The kids had a rough start to the year and they look so happy getting to meet Taylor and I\u2019m sure she was happy to perform for them also. \n\nAlso, of course they are going to be in a more private box. Security alone must be a nightmare if they were in the regular seats. This way it\u2019s probably less bothersome for everyone else to enjoy themselves.",

            "It's definitely for the kids! Taylor's got a rep for being extremely kind to other people's children. A few months ago. Emily Blunt shared a cute [story](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/emily-blunt-taylor-swift-daughter-haircut-1235888687/) about Taylor meeting her daughter and how Taylor gave her daughter a confidence boost.",
            "I wouldn't be surprised if they met behind the scenes! But it wasn't shared because Meghan literally cannot walk outside her home without facing an onslaught of misogynistic and racist articles (and these articles were done to protect William and Kate's musty asses).",
            "They're all salivating at the ways they can spin this photo. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually there's an article about how Meghan and Taylor met but Taylor thought she was a clout chaser.",
            "Yeah, the optics aren't great! She is also not the only celebrity who's met the royal family post Meghan leaving. Regardless that family (not the kids) sucks big time.\n\nThe way his family treated Meghan is abhorrent. I was a Suits fan since day one, so I always feel a little extra protective of Meghan because she was truly delightful to all of us fans.",
            "Ok yes, that makes total sense, I don't know why I didn't think of it. Thanks! So this is likely before the concert?",
            "Yes pretty sure there's something about cleavage and meeting the royals (or something like this), I didn't even think of it when i posted, thank you!",
            "Great points you're making, thank you!",
            "Exactly. People did the same with Sabrina and Barry, saying that the video was their hard lunch as if they havent already attended two red carpets together",
            "No worries, it\u2019s not that clear!",
            "Yes I think so! I did the same double-take, but I remember years ago Princess Anne came to my aunts workplace and there was a faxed list of rules and etiquette for them to follow when she was there. I imagine either by her team or theirs she was advised to wear the jacket."

Its gross. Artists don't actually care about these things. They speak a normal line and gain followers. The most recent example, apart from Taylor ofc, is Kendrick. He literally called out Drake for being a creep and pedo, also abandoning his kids. But just few days ago, Dr Dre opened up his concert. Dr. Dre has been accused by multiple women for abusing and beating them up. That was maybe decades ago, but still, the fact he never apologised properly proves he never improved as a person. How can Kendrick call out Drake, when he literally collabed with Kodak Black? A guy who was arrested for sexual assault, and battery to a TEEN GIRL?\u00a0\n\n\nThis is just the few popular examples. The real losers in this whole fight are victims themselves. These people just support them in fake manner to increase followers and use them as weapons to bring other artists down. No one actually cares about them. Its really hard to find an artist who hasn't collabed with someone that does not have a past related to gross things like these, makes me wonder if the artists themselves choose voluntarily to collab with people like them or the industry is so corrupted that you just can't enter and NOT meet people like these, they are everywhere.",

I think a lot of people are just now understanding that the woman who said these things at that time was THE Gracie Abrahams. \n\nHiring Gracie is indicative of a larger issue of Taylor Swift willingly going into relationships with people who have an unsavory past and overall, not really caring too much what the public thinks of some very specific decisions that\u2019s she\u2019s made in relationships. \n\nIt\u2019s fascinating because for someone who seems to really care how the public perceives her, there are various issues where she clearly doesn\u2019t.\n\nTLDR: Taylor Swift\u2019s role in David O\u2019 Russel\u2019s film \u201cAmsterdam\u201d is arguably even worse than Gracie as the abuse actually transpired (but defending Gracie but your pouting to Taylor\u2019s behavior here like it\u2019s an anomaly.

            "https://preview.redd.it/ln7qhtnh948d1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18cd5b27182838e4ceee57dc09ceb74ea20a3968\n\nTravis in his USA hat meeting Prince William \ud83d\ude02",
            "LMAO I hate the royal family but this clip is actually very endearing. He\u2019s LIVING.",
            "I can't believe he used to be the hot one \ud83e\udd23\n\n(I tease! I grew up in Australia and am a similar age, so Wills was always heartthrobbin' on the magazine covers.)",
            "https://preview.redd.it/olvajl52d48d1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e0db0a982cf1dfd5aa35dd4ff55c27d7ff9af0",
            "William is the cringiest ever.",
            "Its not him \ud83d\ude02 there are many in uk who looks like him",
            "Him trying to be friendly but not touch him and get tased by royal protection officers \ud83d\ude06",
            "I think there is Princess Charlotte on the right so\u2026",
            "Lmao! I read him and the kids were in a super private box so that no one could pics of them.",
            "What do you mean?",
            "Huh?",
            "If it was her there would be close up pics and videos of her and her dad. They are standing with the other fans and no one has any videos except this one?",
            "Possible he might have gone if his kids are fans but will keep it private. Uk journalists will rip him to shreds if he is found out dancing like this while his dad and wife are going through rough stuff.",
            "It\u2019s likely a reference to the US secret service telling Travis they would taze him at his white house visit",
            "Royal protocol is that you don\u2019t touch them- hugs, hands on arms, arm around, that sort of thing. You are often briefed on it before meeting them. Sometimes they relax it but rarely.",
            "There is another one xD\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxr32p0ja48d1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f71e3ca18a23b7c3cfe9b0c748aa2b4f5e179d81",
            "Well videos and a close up selfie are all over social and traditional media today\u2026 he doesn\u2019t seem that concerned with it being private.",
            "The video has already been posted by Sky News so it's definitely him also you can see in the pic with Taylor it's the outfits both him and Charlotte were wearing.",
            "I think this is conclusive evidence I can\u2019t lie \ud83d\ude06",
            "Happy to be proven wrong!!"
