        "content": "# \"Is Cities: Skylines II Worth It?\" \ud83e\udd14\n\n... is one of the most common questions we see on the subreddit at the moment, leading to dozens of duplicate posts asking essentially the same thing: Should I buy the game or not?\n\nIt is our intent that this megathread will help collect information to help you make your decision, and provide a place to ask for more subjective opinions from community members. \n\n## General FAQs\n\nIf you're after general information about or help with the game (e.g. features, minimum or recommended specs, the situation related to modding, when the game will release on consoles), check out our wiki articles below. They'll provide you a decent base level of knowledge and help you understand more about the features and limitations of the game.\n\n- [Getting Started](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_gettingstarted_cs2)\n- [Common Gameplay Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_gameplay_cs2/) \n- [Hardware Advice](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_hardware_cs2)\n- [Downloadable Content (DLC)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_dlc_cs2)\n- [Modding and Custom Content](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_modding_cs2)\n\n## Patches and Bug Fixes\n\nAs of 2023-05-01 there have been 10 patches for the game. These patches have included over 400 changes to the base game. These include both major changes (addition of LOD models for citizens, introduction of modding support) and minor changes (updates to localisation text). You can review the change log for each patch below: \n\n* **1.0.11f1 (2023-10-26):** [9 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.11f1)\n* **1.0.12f1 (2023-11-02):** [17 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.12f1)\n* **1.0.13f1 (2023-11-09):** [18 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.13f1)\n* **1.0.14f1 (2023-11-16):** [21 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.14f1)\n* **1.0.15f1 (2023-12-01):** [46 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.15f1)\n* **1.0.18f1 (2023-12-14):** [42 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.18f1)\n* **1.0.19f1 (2024-01-31):** [63 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.19f1)\n* **1.1.0f1 (2024-03-25):**  [65 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.0f1)\n* **1.1.1f1 (2024-04-02):** [12 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.1f1)\n* **1.1.2f1 (2024-04-25):** [107 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.2f1)\n\n**_OK, but have those patches actually changed anything?_**\n\nCommunity member /u/Safe-Economics-3224 created a benchmark in the weeks after launch and has continued to post results after each patch has released. These give a good indication as to how performance has improved over the life of the game so far:\n\n- [1.0.12f1 (2023-11-02)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17o8ke7/created_a_benchmark_to_accurately_measure/)\n- [1.0.13f1 (2023-11-09)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17syube/patch_1013f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.14f1 (2023-11-16)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17ygxuj/patch_1014f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.15f1 (2023-12-01)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/188zho8/patch_1015f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.18f1 (2023-12-14)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/18kccdb/patch_1018f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.19f1 (2024-01-31)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/1agy7ei/patch_1019f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n\nUnfortunately, /u/Safe-Economics-3224 has gone quiet since this the 1.0.19f1 patch and we've not been able to identify another reliable source of consistent benchmarking results. Big thanks to /u/Safe-Economics-3224 for all of the great work they did on behalf of this community.\n\n## What have the devs been saying?\n\nThe main channel of \"formal\" communication from the developers comes via the Word of the Week blog post shared each Monday by the Colossal Order CEO in the Paradox Forums. We maintain an accompanying megathread which captures a lot of player feedback and reactions to the news shared each week. \n\nAs these are shared weekly, the best way to catch up on past posts is to browse the [Dev Diary flair](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ADev%2BDiary) and dip into the more recent ones. Unfortunately, this link won't work on Reddit's mobile apps (please [tell Reddit if you'd like this fixed](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=23708886396180)) but in the meantime you can go to the main page of the subreddit and use the \"filter by flair\" options provided.\n\n## Live Gameplay Videos\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how the game is playing today, you can check out recent videos or streams from YouTube and Twitch. These will show you the \"real\" game, not marketing videos. As there is only limited mod support for the game at this stage, what you see will _broadly_ be vanilla gameplay and will help you understand how the game is performing at the moment.\n\n- [Cities: Skylines II game page on YouTube, sorted by Recent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVM37E_mrP2kufE8Uu-YOSg/recent)\n- [Cities: Skylines II category page on Twitch, sorted by Recent](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/cities-skylines-ii?sort=RECENT)\n\n## Reviews\n\nMany critic reviews aren't necessarily reflective of the _current_ state of the game. That said, reviews are helpful sources of information to help you decide whether or not to drop your cash on any new game, not just Cities: Skylines II.\n\n- [Metacritic Page](https://www.metacritic.com/game/cities-skylines-ii/) (includes both critic and player reviews)\n- [Steam Review Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash) (you may wish to use the provided filters to show more recent reviews)\n- [Microsoft Review Page](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/cities-skylines-ii-pc-edition/9PGZ346PSLN0) (you may wish to sort by \"recent\")\n\n## Try Before you Buy\n\nIf you're still unsure, Cities: Skylines II is available on Microsoft Game Pass for PC, which is a subscription service at a much lower monthly cost than the full retail price of the game. Microsoft is currently offering an initial 14-day trial for as low as \u00a31/$1/1\u20ac (which renews at full price after the 14 days).\n\n- [US$1 Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0)\n- [\u00a31 Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass)\n- [1\u20ac Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-IE/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0) (this link goes to the Xbox Ireland store, check the local Xbox site for your country before proceding)\n\n## Refunds \n\nIf for any reason you can't make use of a discounted Game Pass for PC subscription (i.e. it may not be available in your region), you have the option of purchasing the game and refunding it within the store's refund window.\n\n- **Steam:** Request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven't accrued more than **2 hours of total playtime** \n- **Microsoft Store:** Request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven't accrued \"a significant amount of play time\"\n\nRecognising that you may not be able to reach the \"late game\" within 2 hours, you can use [this 100k benchmarking city](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17fg7z9/benchmark_your_pc_using_this_100k_population/) to establish whether or not you're comfortable with the performance on your system.\n\n## Specific Questions\n\nIf you've got specific questions about items not covered in these FAQs, feel free to ask them below.

            "It's fun to play with the new roads (especially smooth highway connections) and the assets fun lasts for a bit. After many many hours though, it becomes dull and boring. \n\nI've been waiting over 7 months for metro crossings. Not even elevated metro, just a simple road crossing. Code mods have helped with some things, but a lot is missing. WAY too many half baked ideas in the game such as:\n\n- Tourism (barely exists)\n\n- Snow mechanics\n\n- Transit (lack of vehicles, mechanics such as forcing a limit of vehicles + more)\n\n- Metro (no elevated, no metro crossings, underground connections are a pain)\n\n- Bikes\n\n- Economy (maybe fixed/starting to be fixed in next patch)\n\n- Service buildings (way too big, no variety)\n\nMany more i'm sure I missed",
            "I have the game but haven't opened it since launch.  Are there any mods yet to change the look of the game?  When I see screenshots the lighting is always weird and bland.  Like overcast but with hard shadows.  It doesn't look right to me.  I saw someone play a desert map and it was way too saturated.",
            "Yes, but not to play hundreds of hours. \nCommunity assets are missing and that for me the only thing missing now. \nParadox mods sucks. Every time I launch the game I have to wait for mods update, close the game, reopen, reclose the game. Then sometimes it works, sometimes it\u2019s not. Well big crap.",
            "After a few month i gave it a second shot. With mods there are more option to fix some \"bugs\". However, after a few weeks i'm tired of all the crashes (every time i play the game it crashes at least once), the bugs (super weird bugs), the traffic (no chance of doing something against ist), the performance (with 4080, 64gb ram and i7 i play with super ugly textures and my GPU is at 95% ). Its really frustrating as i really want to have fun. But it's more off a me cussing in front of my PC instead of having fun. I really hope they'll fixing it",
            "If this game gets itself fixed up soon then it's worth it, if they start spamming out dlc, then no, it won't be worth it.",
            "My game literally won\u2019t load with mods but without is fine",
            "A lot of the answers in here are just being intentionally pessimistic. I think if anyone is looking *right now* and considering, wait a tiny bit longer and check again. They'll be releasing the economy rework (among a few other things) in the next week or two, which might make a substantial difference in a lot of the gameplay issues. There's still a lot of other stuff they need to address afterward, but you won't have to wait long to see if it makes a difference.",
            "If you haven't purchased it yet, you could probably hold off a little longer and wait until a game of the year version or a big sale.",
            "Not really, the game is bland and boring outside of the bugs.  This company kind of shot themselves in the foot not changing engines and making the game look and feel better than the first game.  It would have been far better to take the old game and just offer and upgrade along with the 100s of dollars in expansions we already bought along with it.",
            "I am waiting until they finish the game. It seems to me everyone who brought CS2 brought a beta. I just got CS1 and it is crazy to have 43 DLC's so far and I guess one more is coming Landmark Buildings which I see when I open the gave in a window above my listed DLC's.",
            "If you are a detailer that wants to build a realistic american city using 40 mods, then Yes. If you just want to play a city builder, then No. Simple as that for me.",
            "No. It hasn't been and still it's not.",
            "No. And at this rate it hardly has a future",
            "I think I'd like to get CS:II now that it has mod support but I have a few questions.\n\n\nAre essential mods like Move it! In the game? Any big missing ones?\n\n\nI rarely game much except on my steam deck. Anybody know if this game is playable on there yet? All SD reviews I've found are from launch.\u00a0",
            "I'm hoping I can say yes one of these months, but sadly still no.",
            "Current state no.   Once asset editor releases.  Maybe",
            "No it's not, the simulation is broken, the assets are ugly and look all the same and the grid breaks all the time\n\nI'm not even talking about performance\n\nSomeone just port the cs2 road tool to cs1 so we cam bury this mess",
            "The biggest thing for me is the lack of props. I like detailing and creating little spaces that make my cities look nice, and lived in. Benches, fountains, the little food cats. That was where a lot of the fun in Cities 1 came from for me. Can't do that yet, and until I can Cities 2 isn't what I'm looking for.",
            "No, because there is no variety in architectural styles yet, although I am glad that the new Sully mod which allows for a lot of details has been released.  but for me, the variety of architectural styles is important.",
            "Not in the current state. It\u2019s kinda bland.",
            "I've been checking in and it seems like since release performance has gotten better and there are mods. But that's it. Now you move into the economy and simulation being fundamentally broken, the ancient tile system that an indie game made by one person made better instantly and lack of assets.\n\nMaybe later this year? Maybe...",
            "I wonder if preformance still sucks (rtx 3080, i5 13600KF and 32gb 3600mhz ram)",
            "I don't own the game but waiting for a sale I read on PC gamer that they are removing rent mechanic. Is that true and if so is there a mod to add it back in??",
            "if you have a good PC and don't care about getting asset variety it's pretty decent, and it's hard to go back to 1 after you're used to the improved scale and tools of 2.",
            "Short answer: no\n\nLong answer: noooooooo",
            "I think so 100%, as long as you have a semi-competent computer, it\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ve completely switched to C:S2 from C:S1. Lack of asset mods has been lame, but that will be added soon enough!",
            "No.\n\n  \nI'm a completionist and spent over 300 hours trying to get 100%, only to get 98% because the last achievement won't fucking unlock for anybody in the world.",
            "If you want to play more than 20 hours, no",
            "Has the dawn strobing bug been fixed yet?",
            "I plan to build a new PC in the coming 8 to 12 months. But until then, has anyone been succesfully running the game with an 7th gen I7 and a 3060?",
            "I'm thoroughly enjoying it and would not go back to CS1.",
            "no.",
            "No, but perhaps the update coming this month on the economy and being able to add assets might change my vote to a maybe... Possibly a yes.",
            "I don\u2019t think anyone mentioned this yet so I\u2019ll put my 2 cents. If it\u2019s your first city builder then I think it\u2019ll be worth it, it takes time to get into mods and assets starting out (at least for me), so I think given time, you\u2019ll get better with the game and experiment with mods as more is done, at least that\u2019s what we should expect from the devs at least?",
            "I've recently picked it back up. Where I was hesitant before, I can fully recommend it now\n\nRoad building is genuinely fantastic. Whatever complex intersection you want, it just works\n\nThe in-game assets all look quite good. The different zoning types create a lot of variety\n\nPerformance has not been a major issue for me (3069 Ti)\n\nI don't really know about the economy as I have only played on infinite money\n\nAnd now with mods, detailing is also amazing. I'd say it's almost easier and better than CS1 already.\n\nThe only thing missing is custom assets. A big miss, but they will hopefully come soon. Luckily the base assets look quite good so it's not as big of a miss as it was for CS1",
            "It is. Road tools alone makes the game better than CS1. Once assets come in, it's over",
            "Nope.",
            "I'm sure there is a good article somewhere that lists features the cs2 has that cs1 does not have even with mods. any good recommendations?",
            "Have the graphical issues improved? I purchased CS2 day of release and there were an incredible amount of graphical issues such as clipping (I forget what the actual term is). My computer can run any game.",
            "I'm having significantly better performance on my 2070.",
            "Is it worth playing without mods? The only way I could play nowadays is with geforce now and it doesn't support mods...",
            "No, I honestly refuse to buy paradox products because of this games failure.",
            "Nope. Still needs another year. Unless it gets abandoned before then, which also seems likely.",
            "I've already decided that I'll wait a while. Somemething like a year or so, maybe",
            "to people commenting just yes or no, you are unhelpful. \n\nas someone who recently started playing the game via xbox gamepass (just $10 a month) I'd say this would be the best way to evaluate if the game is for you. after putting in like 20 hours, I'd say I'm pleased with the game despite it's bugs and flaws. literally daily, mods are getting added/updated to PDX mods. in my opinion, most essential QOL mods are basically already there so I'd vouch for the game. \n\nall that being said, I'm still going to wait for a sale to pick it up but until then, I'll get to enjoy it and a few others on gamepass.",
            "Yes. With obviously a ton of nuances.\n\nI'd say you have to be a fan of city building and urbanism, for a casual player there's not enough fun and challenge in core mechanics to keep you entertained for long, but we're slowly coming there with mods and upcoming patches and content.\n\nIt's more a city painter than a city simulation. Detailers can already do mad things, I see more and more screenshots that are almost photorealistic and a level of detailing that was completely impossible with CS1 full modded.\nBut these kind of people don't care too much about the economy and sim, it's more the kind of people that play with everything unlocked at start.\n\nMy personal experience: this is my kind of genre in general but I'm not a hardcore fan either. I like both aspects of CS franchise, ie. city painting and city simulation. I like detailing (and be able to do \"illegal\" things with mods), but not too much, the gameplay element is important to me. 50/50.\nWhile I was let down on the sim, I had a blast with the rest and had 100+ mods installed with no serious issue whatsoever, it's actually more stable and performant than CS1 especially considering the step up in graphics quality and scale of the simulation.\n\nOn the sim there are positive things to say too, I like that cims don't have pocket cars anymore, that traffic is way more dynamic and realistic (with a few annoying issues), and that the number of agents simulated can go waaay higher with much better performance comparatively. Economy is virtually ignorable right now but the *framework* is there to make it much better than it's predecessor.\n\nAfter 250 hrs, which is already money well spent for me, I felt a bit unmotivated to continue my city (regrettably so, I'd have liked to continue) because of the shallow sim I think, but I started modding the game instead, which is really fun. Modding in CS2 has incredible potential.\nNow I'm awaiting the economy rework, if it's good enough I'll surely play again as I already miss playing the game. If that's not it, then in a few months/year I should be able to pour hundreds of hours in this game again!",
            "Personally I've been enjoying it with the code mods and have had a decent time with it. Is it as good as CS 1 right now? No, but it's a lot better for a more casual play right now. Hopefully this year the game will become more challenging than cities skylines 1. \n\nRight now I would say get it if you are fine using just code mods, playing casually, and don't mind a bug here and there, then go ahead and get 2, but know you'll be waiting a while for patches to roll through. \n\nIf you like to get more of a challenge, have more options with assets, and don't mind spending quite a lot of time tinkering for detailing, then stick with 1 for now. \n\nI know at some point cities 2 will be way ahead of cities 1, right now it's definitely not there. \n\n\n\nTldr: CS2 is worth it if you currently want a more casual experience (until the game gets harder (hopefully)), are fine with lack of assets, and dealing with occasional bugs. Some code mods will fix issues.",
            "if you dont have either then get CS2 no point in getting Cs1 when it will soon be abandoned and Cs2 will get better",
            "Performance seems a lot better, and the code mods have fixed a lot of my gripes with the game.\n\nIf you like building a city's transport network, it's a pretty good time.\n\nIf you want to build a city for looks, then I'd wait until the asset editor comes out.",
            "Yes. Especially if you've played stock CS1.",
            "Which DLCs/mechanics introduced to CS1 through DLCs are already a part of the base game in CS2?",
            "I purchased CS2 the day it came out and was unplayable on my machine. Comparatively, I'm able to play games on ultra settings like baldurs gate, assassin's creed, God of war, Stanfield, etc. CS would crash, lag and freeze, and generally be slow even on the lowest settings. I tried optimizing based on their recommendations as well a CPP's and nothing helped. Steam finally let me return it after a few months of updates since nothing improved. \n\n\nWhat about now? I'm hesitant to purchase again...I doubt they'd let me return it a second time. Has the game improved enough for me to be able to attempt to play this?\n\n\nAcer predator helios 300 PH315-55-795C\ni7 12700H 2.3 GHz\nNvidia GeForce rtx 3070 ti\n64gb ram",

            "It's an incredible game. I've sunk so many hours into it, they' done very well. However, I still experience many bugs, there is a lot of polishing left to do, but still, it's fun to just imagine how utterly amazing it will be when everything is eventually smoothed out. Also keep in mind I play on a high end computer and a 42\" screen",
            "Is it on Xbox series s",
            "Worth it, if you\u2019re looking for a long term goal. Possibly better than CS1 at the moment. When new bits are added like proper finance etc it will be an up to date city builder. Next will be multi-player with war options etc. Stormy seasons in the sea for boats and the likes.",

            "I played the game 60 hrs, last played a few weeks ago. \n\nCouple days ago I went back to cities skylines 1 with dlc and it was glaringly obvious the first is still the more complete and better game. \n\nI will say CS2 felt fun at first, but there's so much less game than CS1 and you as the player end up forgiving so much because you can see the building blocks for a really great sequel, those buildng blocks just don't and haven't come together since launch. It's missing so much. \n\nFinding out the entire shipping/economy system was fake and had no effect on anything is the city or the game was a really bad sign. 6 months after launch and it still isn't any better or better fleshed out is a sign. They're only significant dlc included like 2 new park buildings, and completely ignored tons of broken parts about the game. When I played a few weeks ago those parts were still broken. Bad sign. And, no mod support and no real prospect of mod support, which is weird for a game that blew up on the ability of community improvement. Bad sign. \n\nCities skylines 2 has also already lost its release momentum. The game has probably already reached its peak in popularity, and Paradox hasn't don't enough to earn anyone coming back to give the game a second change. \n\nUltimately, it just wasn't better than CS1. Sure, some sequels are worse at launch than their predecessor and getter better with dlcs, but CS2 isnt doing thay at all and its been 6 months. CS1 is still the supreme city building game, anyone who wants to build a city should and will play that. After my last few days I wish Paradox would put their time and effort into more DLC for that game. \n\nIf you take the road management tools from CS2 and out them in CS1, CS1 does everything single better. CS2 is probably going to get forgotten, unfortunately, as my hopes for that game were through the roof. I bought the game on launch. I just love city builders.\n\nEdit: fun tidbit, someone online discovered the whole economy/import/export depot was completely fake and had no whatsoever. There was talk of them giving guaranteed refunds even after the return period because of misleading and false advertising, but idk what happened to that. Doesn't matter, but the game still has never been able to do what it promised it could.",
            "Thats why i gave up on mods long ago on CS1 and went to console. Been sick of keeping my game alive, every dlc, update, etc made it collapse. \nPlaying pure vanilla is what i wanted, just play when i want without fear of crashing everything\ud83d\ude05",

I'd wait for the console version first, if it ever materializes, as this would mean they finally made it run ok on run of the mill modern PCs (which yours isn't, btw, you are above PS5/Xbox Series X's specs).",

If you're not ready for hardcore detailing I'd encourage you to wait a bit to avoid being let down, indeed and wait for feedback on the upcoming patch.\n\nOtherwise you can already do fun and beautiful things without even entering the editor. Want a park that also works as a fully functional train station bc why not, with an entirely custom building made out of meshes borrowed from Vanilla assets? It's possible. But that requires hard work. Add editor knowledge on top of that and there's a whole world of possibilities.\nThere's already a rapid multiplication of \"unofficial\" custom assets on PDX mods that helps a lot in getting a less repetitive city.\n\nSurveying Discords, like the City Skylines Modding one is also a good way (and a better way than Reddit) to have a better overview of what's possible and how good players enjoy the game themselves, definitely gave me inspiration and skills that allowed to enjoy the game more, and a constant itch to get back to it (well, I'm modding it right now which is a game in itself, but I mean playing it \ud83d\ude01)",

            "A disappointing update, but at least we have official communication about it now instead of being left in the dark.  I hope the patch is good.  I'm still very excited to play it, but this week's experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and makes me worry that their communication has not changed for the better.\n\nI've been a dev for 15 years.  One thing I've learned is that you can have your own internal targets, but only communicate dates to your customer when they're a sure thing.  Hiding behind words like \"might\" and \"expect\" don't help.  Yes, they're not promises, but they're still communicating *expectations*.  When you cast a wide net such as June 3 - 19, your customer is going to expect that the 19th is the latest they can expect delivery without needing additional information from you.  If you can't meet that date, you should be communicating why that's the case in advance so the 19th doesn't come, go, and your customer is beating down your door for an update.  \n\nIf I were CO, I would have said we're targeting Q3 for the patch.  As development progresses and we get closer to meeting our internal June 19th target, I would start whittling that down to June/July (Surprise!  It's early!), then late June, then June 24th ONLY when we've fully completed dev/QA and we have Steam certification.  This business of externally communicating dates when the length of development is unknown is for the birds.  Please don't give *any* dates that you're not sure of.  Instead, give us regular updates on how things are going and the things you're working on.  If you want to know the style of communication that gamers want, look at what the team building Satisfactory is doing and model after that.",

But little to no delivery and repeatedly subpar execution has led to a constant erosion of trust of the players.\n\nWe were told console versions would be released alongside PC since launch, but less than a month before release, the rug got pulled from under us and we were told Spring 2024. Well, here we are 9 months later at the end of Spring 2024, with promises now of October. Maybe third time's time charm?\n\nHow they released a whole DLC called Beach Properties without a single person at the company going, \"Hey wait a minute shouldn't we add beaches?\" is beyond me.\n\nI'm glad someone finally realized last month that releasing a weekly newsletter without weekly delivery or updates was a bad idea.\n\nAnd for Q3 and Q4 half of what we currently have to look forward to is... radio stations (audio files)? These need to be scrapped. 95% of players do not want more radio stations. They want functioning game mechanics and optimization.\n\nThe problem now is the amount of patches that it is going to take to fix the base game mechanics and content. We are at the end of Q2 and entering industrisemester, and we are witnessing in real time how long it is taking to fix ONE of the game's major mechanics/issues. Will we need an Economy 3.0 Patch? Time will tell, but it's entirely within the realm of possibility. \n\nThe communication has been abysmal, it has been one long chain of \"jk lol\"s, and it feels like every update is just more disappointment.

Game devs release an unfinished game, and take the better part of the game\u2019s earlier years just fixing it up. Always overpromising and underdelivering the entire way. That\u2019s how the gaming industry treats us, and as long as we keep giving them money, that\u2019s how it\u2019ll stay.\n\nIf you want to enjoy anything anymore, set your expectations low.

I genuinely don't understand how they keep messing this up.\n\nGamers, however, have this knack for getting hyped up by marketing, then disappointed by the finished product, getting enraged about it, and then repeating the cycle. I swear some people in these communities have the memories of goldfish coupled with a desire to be relentlessly kicked in the junk.\n\nOn top of everything else, the anonymity and instantaneous power of the internet encourages a ton of negativity, making everything worse. Instead of writing your thoughts in a letter and putting it in the mail, or writing something in the newspaper or a magazine, you can just post some toxic nonsense on reddit that takes 5 minutes to write, and about 30 seconds of rationalization. On top of that, places like reddit encourage the loudest voices to get the most attention, they want you to \"engage\" so you use the app more, and see more ads.\n\nTLDR: CO needs to fix their communications issues.

            "It's surprising how different a release process can be from game to game. CS1 is probably a pretty well oiled machine at this point for releases, with well established processes and known variables. CS2 is a new experience, even if the team is the same. Never assume that anything is easy when it comes to a new release. New code base, new tools, new processes will take time to figure out.",
            "Yes????? How is it not. They are completely different revenue streams. \n\nAnd yeah I know it\u2019s old that\u2019s why it\u2019s kinda pathetic how the new one isn\u2019t any better.",
            "In Estonia we celebrate Victory Day on the 23rd, that's why we have 2 days off work.",
            "You're forgetting tiny indie title Crusader Kings 3, which seems to have sold over two million units compared to city skyline 2's one million units, and its half a dozen DLC packs compared to CS2's... One?",

            "back to CS1!",
            "No, just no.  They have been working on this game for YEARS.  Experience building and releasing software does not change that much from product to product.",
            "They are different games, sure. But you are still indirectly giving CO money for screwing up CS2.\n\nAlso, CS1 doesn't really have a future. Once CS2 gets better and gets assets and console version, whenever that might be, few people will play it anymore. And unless someone makes a new competitor, which i don't see happening in the next few years, the people who don't buy CS2 now will probably buy it eventually anyway.",
            "Game released 4 years ago sells more than game released one year ago. More news at 8.",
            "Well there's a difference in opinion and experiences on how game releases work here.\n\nRegardless I do think it's worth cutting the dev team some slack; mistakes happen and they aren't intentionally missing the date. The comment that prompted my reply was in relation to execs and shareholders pushing for the release date. That's just not the reality, it's just a dev team shooting for a goal and missing it due to some process issue, which is quite common for larger releases.",
            "CS1 has a future the same way SimCity4 had a future: the sequel disappointed upon release. Instead of making a new game that was better than its predecessor, both Maxis and CO pushed out a buggy, unbalanced game that met very few of the expectations people had for a *sequel*, especially with as much time as there was between games. Lots of things nobody asked for, and little of what was requested unless it received a sub-par implementation.\n\nJust as I still play SC4 and never bought SC5, I still play CS and won't buy CS2 unless major improvements are made.",
            "You are missing the point and don\u2019t seem to understand how a for-profit business works to sell products. CS2 has to be provable as its own revenue stream to survive. If more people are buying an old product than the new one, that not only indicates to them that their future revenue is in jeopardy, but it also shows them that they have a perfect jumping off place for improvement. Make the new game more like the old one."

The goal of this project was to build an organically grown city that is largely unplanned and influenced by topography and natural features. Transport infrastructure is built on an as needed basis as realistically as possible\u2026 aka lowest cost solution to fix hot spots just like real life. This explains all the at-grade intersections except for the busiest traffic locations.  Also tried to minimize highway infrastructure cutting through the city centre. Traffic during rush hour gets pretty bad but the city has an extensive tram, metro and bus network as an alternative to driving. What do you guys think?",

            "Not cleanly Vanilla. Until we get asset mods, I would be splitting the roads and using two separate 2 lane, one way roads, and a tram track in the middle of them. It'll look a bit better modded because you can place the assets closer together with Move it, but you could do this vanilla as well, it'll just be much wider and farther spaced out.\n\nEdit: Played around a little using Anarchy and Move it, here's an example of a short, unrealistic ramp, and a longer, more realistic ramp. You could make these vanilla as well, they would just need a little bit more spacing. I would like some road networks that are a bit tighter and waste less space to make this more cleanly. For example, no inner parking or sidewalk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxmaegwgt08d1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=645a30d4738cb32420d785869b9f7fd129b34eb2",

No more fixed lane networks, just add/subtract road element. Want to remove the sidewalk? Replace tool. No more parking? Need to create an asymmetric road by adding a lane on one side of the road?
