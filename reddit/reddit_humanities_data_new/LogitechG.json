        "content": "We have identified an issue that may cause the reported battery percentage being incorrectly displayed in G HUB for some of the following headsets:\n\nG533  \nG733  \nG933/G933S  \nG935  \nPro X Wireless\n\nPlease note this situation affects the reporting of the battery, but not the battery of the headsets itself.\n\nWe are actively working on a fix for the next update as part of our ongoing effort to resolve any product issues that arise.\n\nA temporary workaround is possible following these steps : \n\nStep 1: If the device is charging, unplug the charging cable  \nStep 2: Unplug the receiver, wait for a couple of seconds and reconnect it  \nStep 3: This will help to display the actual battery percentage.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding as we tackle this issue head-on and we will keep you updated.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out for support to our Customer Service team (at [https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us) ) if you experience any further problems.\n\nCheers!\n\n",

            "It would be nice if you actually fixed g hub so it would open. I have tried every \" fix \" and still can't get it to open. Basically bought a mouse I cant even use"

Different computer.\n\nI have this mouse since 2022.\n\nAnyone had this? Is there a simple solution for it?",

Settings may or may not be remembered between power cycles. \n\nHowever:\nhttps://github.com/MatMoul/g810-led\nAnd\nhttps://github.com/keyleds/keyleds\n\nI use the first option - but you may need to investigate further if you want animation.\n\nEdit: I see the first option can control animated effects too, so maybe that's all you need. I also see g810-led in some repos - so depending on your choice of distro it may be a simple install.",
