If you've eq'd and turned volume and fx faders/knobs 20.000 times on every song you'll be both, trained and experienced very well and annoyed by it so much that you just want to finish the song ***good enough***!\n\nNo one will dislike a song if you eq'd a snare by 0.8 db at 700hz when you think you shouldn't. You'll never really know whats good to others. You have to make what you think sounds good.\n\nYou're not your audience, your mom is not your audience and especially other producers in general are not your audience I mean they can but they're a small special group.\n\nThe audience can be anyone and the audience decides what they like.\n\nThis is what helped me overcome the perfectionism.\n\nAfter having financial problems and not releasing anything in years Duke Dumont started finishing his songs to 80% good. He said he was never 100% satisfied with ANY of his releases.\n\nI think he has some great songs. He's not his audience. I am his audience and I gave him at least a little engagement boost by listening to his songs endless times and I shared his music with my friends who listened to him too very often.\n\nDeadmau5 had strobe in his trash folder and he was absolutely annoyed by it and only showed it out of a little curiosity to his friend? or manager and he said he has to release hit.\n\nThis song is what deadmau5 made a star.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nBest of luck!",

Does your track sound similar in terms of sound quality to your reference track(Always use reference tracks - they give great guidance for mixing and help with arranging/what instruments/sounds to use).\n\n2. Does it \"bop\"? AKA, Does it sound good. Does it make you or other people wanna bop their heads?\n\nIf the answer to the 2 questions above is YES - then yeah.. all the small stuff doesnt matter. \n\nSometimes music producers can give terrible feedback because:\n\na) More often than not - they arent qualified to give feedback. They bought FL studio a year ago and are now convinced they are experts. If you do want to recieve feedback, make sure to consider WHO is giving feedback. Is it a producer with YEARS of experience and someone who actually works in the industry - or some random 16 year old in his moms basement.\n\nb)They are too disconnected from the music. All that matters with music is that it bops and sounds good and pleasing to the ear. Many producers get too overly technical in the way they analyze the music.   \nIf your music sounds good - nobody cares that your vocal sample was 0.0002 seconds too long, or the reverb on that cymbal hit could have been at 28% wet, rather than 30% wet.\n\nIf it bops, it bops.

        "content": "I understand why the philosophy of clipping transients early is helpful, and why using ducking and other mixing tricks to make the clipper do as little work as possible helps with transparent loudness.\n\nI don't understand what the point of the \"to zero\" part is though. Baphometrix sets the peak level of a track to zero, then drives a clipper with it's ceiling at zero until the audio degrades audibly, then dials the drive back a bit. Why not just leave the track at wherever it happens to be peaking, then drop the ceiling of the clipper until it degrades, then dial it back up a notch?\n\nAm I missing some benefit of having the mixer buses always peaking at 0 instead of whatever value below 0? Maybe it's just that you can have a more predictable set up in terms of your monitoring volume etc?",

            "Not everything needs to be -6 LUFS.\n\nCTZ is just a method that lets you control dynamics in a more nuanced/controlled way than slapping on a limiter at the master a pray your song will hold up when you drive up the input to meet your loudness target (whatever that target is).\n\nYou can perfectly use CTZ to produce fully transparent songs at -10 LUFS or softer too. But even those songs, after mastering, will have peaks to 0 or just under. CTZ will just let you produce at a level where you will eventually wish to end up as well at mastering, so you will hear and be able to make choices during production and mixing which will help your master to come out the way you envision. You will have LESS rework of your song because the CTZ method forces you to make those decisions already during much earlier stages of production.\n\nSo think of it that way...",
            "I watched clip to 0 and feel like it\u2019s probably useful for bass producers going for maximum loudness, but even then I\u2019m not really sure either. If you just mix well and use clipping like you said to transparently chop off the transients you can get your track pretty loud.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s weird that it gets treated as the end all be all on this subreddit. I also think it could be explained much faster than the videos.\u00a0 \n\nEdit: no disrespect to baphometrix who clearly put a lot into those videos.\u00a0",
            "I've wondered this too, if you've ever listened to any of their tracks, granted the only ones you can find are from 5+ years ago, the mixing on them isn't anything terribly special or  interesting. It has a very uninspired quality of depth imo.",
            "That\u2019s my one issue with that method.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of valuable info in baph\u2019s series. But there\u2019s no reason to mix loud. Your tracks don\u2019t need to be pushed to the max. It gives you no headroom for mix decisions later on.\n\nWanna turn up that snare a bit? Too bad you\u2019re already at zero on your snare track haha\n\nI use clippers, and my busses have general targets I aim for. Bass is -12, drums is -6.\n\nIf you have a track, and you clip it at zero, it will be loud when it gets to your master limiter, and there won\u2019t be big transients. Push your final limiter to like -2 reduction and you\u2019re set.\n\nIf you have a track, and you clip it at -8, it will be at -8 when it gets to your master limiter. But because you\u2019ve managed your transients, you can crank the gain on your limiter by 10db, and you\u2019ll get the exact same -2db of reduction, and the same loudness.\n\nThe most important aspect of the method is just clipping where transients sum together, to keep everything managed. How loud or quiet your track is on the track faders is irrelevant. Everything in baphs video makes sense, but they never once explain what actual reason there is for it to be \u201cto zero\u201d, although they insist it\u2019s crucial.\n\nThey have no explanation because there isn\u2019t one. If the transient is clipped at some point, It doesn\u2019t matter at what db it\u2019s clipped",
            "You can correct me if I'm wrong. But in their videos, Baphometrix says to make your mixing decisions by moving your faders after you Clip to Zero. From my understanding, the intention isn't to leave everything at zero. You get the max loudness you can out of your sounds and then do your leveling. For me, clipping or limiting to zero can be nice because I know if my fader is at -5 or whatever, that's exactly where it's peaking.",
            "The whole idea of CTZ or as classic rock engineers call it \u201cmixing for loudness\u201d\n\nIs to distribute the load between clippers/limiters\n\nRather than having say 60 tracks all going straight to the master and getting limited/clipped all by 1 limiter/clipper you divide the load between a series of different channels and chains\n\nSo you have you drums going to 1 group and getting clipped\n\nsynths going to another and getting clipped\n\nbasses going to another and getting clipped\n\nthen you sent those groups to more groups to get clipped then sometimes another \u201cpre master group\u201d to get clipped again and then the master with it being clipped a final time \n\nDepending on how you have your session routed and what you have getting sent where you can create \u201clayering\u201d \n\nWhat this means is depending on how you have your session set up, you could get your drums to sit further forward in the mix and be more present or have the vocals sit right up front and over top of everything else\n\nIn my opinion unless you are have a understanding of audio engineering and what things are actually doing and why they are happening - copying someone\u2019s well known tutorial won\u2019t get you very far unless you know how to correctly utilise it. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t do it. By study what a clipper/limiter is, what it actually does, how it works, what happens to a signal when it\u2019s clipped/limited etc \n\nIn turn you will able to look at something like mixing for loudness and understand and comprehend exactly what\u2019s going on\n\n- signed producer/audio engineer",

            "in baph's method, you can level the tracks after \"clipping to zero\". the philosophy of his method is that, either you move faders down, or you move clippers up. wanna turn the snare up? try pushing it into the clipper more, and if it degrades too harshly, try turning the faders down on other sounds or busses instead. it might not be the workflow you prefer but you're misrepresenting it. turning the faders of your busses down to -12, -6 etc is totally allowable in CTZ."

            "What exactly are you trying to achieve? Most of the instruments should have their own adsr.",
            "Not aware of any plugin that does this. In ableton there\u2019s a max 4 live device though that achieves this. It\u2019s called envelope if my memory serves me right.",
            "It\u2019s not really possible 100% because once the sounds come out of each synth there isn\u2019t really a way to access the individual voices, so you can only slap a volume and a filter plugin on the whole mix of sounds, which will always affect everything at once, so no overlapping filter curves per voice. The closest you can get is probably using SerumFX. You can slap it on the sum and feed it the same midi signal externally and it\u2019ll trigger the volume and filter envelopes accordingly.",
            "I'm trying to make a sound something similar to Rufus  Innerbloom brass lead. It sounds like there's a filter or something opening on the attack part.\n\nI've got a garritan orchestra library on kontakt but you can't do filtering or anything on there I think. \n\nI thought there should be a way of triggering the filter with the midi data note on and offs...",
            "Ok, I'm fine with the filter effecting all the voices at once, just want to be able to change the adsr of it to fine tune the sound. Are there filters you can route the midi note on/ off data for adsr as well as route the audio to do this?",
            "Unless I\u2019m missing something about your question SerumFX does exactly that, as said. It\u2019s basically the whole fx signal chain of Serum as its own plugin. You can use midi notes to trigger all the envelopes just like if you used it as a synth and you can route those envelopes to anything you want, including the filter cutoff. You just need an duplicate of your midi track to feed into it as far as I know, but maybe there\u2019s a way to route it differently in reaper so you can feed it the same notes from the track directly. \n\nAs someone else suggested there are also plugins that can use the audio amplitude as a modulation input, like FilterFreak. Ableton also has a m4l device called \u201eenvelope follower\u201c, which you can map to any parameter you\u2019d want. Those don\u2019t take any midi input though so there\u2019s a bit less freedom and accuracy in the exact shaping of the envelope.",
            "Soundtoys FilterFreak could do the filter part. Bit pricy when not on sale, but a very handy filter plugin nevertheless.",
            "Ok thanks I'll look at serum",
            "SerumFX is included when buying Serum, it\u2019s just a separate download on the Xfer page, just so you know."
