            "I don't really feel this is appropriate to share with most people in my personal like but this is a huge accomplishment I've been working toward my whole career; I crossed $1,000,000 net worth sometimes in June, just reviewed my roll-up and am at $1,021,525.62.\n\nIt's about $350k in 401k, $50k cash, and $600k in my personal brokerage accounts, with no debt.  I've been maxing 401k for several years now and almost all of my personal brokerage is $SPY, I also have another approx $500k of RSUs that aren't vested yet but don't count those as I haven't got them vested yet.\n\nI just wanted to share as this is such a huge personal milestone \ud83d\ude00",
            "Throwaway account for obvious reasons...\n\nThere is a high likelihood I will be receiving an additional $200k taxable income on top of my salary this year. 29 years old and still living at home (not for much longer).\nMy new/current income approx $150k/yr gross and that will continue steadily. \n\nAlready maxing out my Roth and have about $40k between cash reserves and investments. I'm a 1099 employee and take advantage of additional write downs each year on my taxes.\n\nMy two major fixed expenses each month are student loans: $483/mo and vehicle $516/mo (will own vehicle outright in 5 years)\n\nStudent loan balance: $61k at 4.62% fixed \nCar loan balance: $27k at 4.75% fixed\n\nLet's figure I walk away with an additional $120k net after taxes. My ultimate goal is to take the next step in my life and get my own place. I'm not against the idea of renting (approx $3,100/mo in my area plus utilities) for a few years because I will be in a position earning around $600k by then.\n\nIf I were to buy a house right now, I realistically I would want a $700k or so property just based on my own tastes/needs.\n\nShould I use that ~$120k to erase the student loan and perhaps use the additional $60k to more or less cover 2 years of rent? Keep all the loans (because I can afford to pay them as is now) and use the full amount as a down payment on a home?\n\nThis is not income I was anticipating this year so in my head, it's basically \"free\" money to me. Just looking for any thoughts/ideas on the best way to use it",
            "a huge accomplishment i made:\n\ni ended up in the ER twice this semester for various health problems and racked up a 18.6k medical debt (20 year old college student lol). after half a year of negotiating, fighting, insurance sending stuff back and forth, etc, i got the 18.6k reduced to 1.5k!\n\nnot only that, i applied to and received an emergency grant from my school to pay off that bill, and i paid everything off without spending a single penny of my own money! technically i have the emergency funds to pay off the 1.5k but my emergency fund isn't huge; it would've been a good chunk of my money, especially since i took almost 2k out to pay my taxes a couple of months ago.\n\nthis feels like a huge win because not only am i a poor first-gen immigrant on a full-ride to school, both times i went to the ER, i almost didn't go despite serious worries for my health. i was sure i wouldn't be able to afford the bills and wanted to ride out the terrible pain, but my friends managed to convince me it's better than i live and pay than die.",
            "Congrats!\n\nI came to post the same kind of update: I'm 39 and I just crossed $1mm net worth this past week.\n\nI grew up lower middle class. I learned my financial discipline on my own, and my parents used to daydream about being \"a millionaire.\" When I was younger, it seemed like a crazy idea to think that I'd get here, let alone before the age of 40.\n\nI get it -- a million isn't the same as it used to be, and it doesn't mean I'm suddenly in the 1% or that I can go buy a place in the Hamptons, but it still feels like a milestone I (and you, too) should celebrate!",
            "Your student loans are a lower rate *and* a lower monthly payment. There's no reason to pay them off over your car.\n\n\nBetween paying off your car or keeping it all, it's pretty close to a wash mathematically. If you can have 20% down and keep a healthy emergency fund, I'd pay down the car.\u00a0",
            "My thought was that over the next 5 years the car would be paid off anyway. The loan has something like 25 years left (I expect to pay it off sooner than that anyway but not within the next 5 years like the car would be) Over the long term the interest keeping the student loan would be significantly higher than the car",
            "If you're expecting 600k salary, won't you be paying down the debt anyway?\u00a0",
            "Oh yeah definitely. I'm very fortunate to be in the position that I am right now. Am I wrong in my thinking though that even over just the next 5 years, the interest accumulating on the larger student loan balance would be more than interest on the smaller car loan?"

            "Honestly call your car insurance, electric, and phone bill & explain the situation, ask for a grace period. As long as this doesn\u2019t happen frequently they\u2019re usually cool about it.\n\nYou can try the same with that loan, but who knows, might as well try.\n\nHonesty is the best policy. Also, wouldn\u2019t any loan rate greatly outpace the 1 time late penalties you might receive on these bills?",
            "If you called them could you request a late payment or adjust the due dates out?",
            "Dog walking (Rover?) or InstaCart?\u00a0\nYou can try to get a loan from a local credit union. The interest is a lot lower, but generally you need a reason other than \u201cbehind on bills\u201d\u00a0\nCalling the companies is a good start. I don\u2019t know how long it takes for them to start shutting off services, but it could be longer than you\u2019d expect.\u00a0\nHang in there!\u00a0",

            "As someone else suggested, the first thing you should be doing is calling and asking for an extension/about a grace period so you can have some extra time to pay if they offer it. I know my family has called about the electric bill before and they pushed the due date back a few days, no late penalties. If you have some free time, or try to make some free time and post on Facebook in groups asking if anyone has any yard work that need done immediately and all that type of stuff. Lots of people need yard tending to this time of year. \n\nToday is only the 21st so I would suggest looking in r/beermoney you might get approved for something with a few days and be able to scrap up a few bucks to help pay your bills.",

            "OP, everyone else has already given you really great advice. I have found that Mint Mobile is pretty comparable to major companies (technically it\u2019s T Mobile since they just got bought out). I pay $300 ($25/month) for the year for 20gb (I think it\u2019s $30/month for unlimited) and have no regrets. Used to do Xfinity Mobile and that was so terrible. $80/month for phone bill is a lot, there are other options out there!\n\nAlso, shop around for energy suppliers! My bills were $120/month for electric, but then I shopped around and now they\u2019re closer to $60-70. I think every state has a website that makes it easy to see what\u2019s out there side by side.

            "Adult talk, the loan or any solution now isn\u2019t an answer to the real problem. You already have a loan, so you have a pattern of spending too much, more than you earn. \n\nWhat do you do for groceries? What kind of phone do you have, can you earn more? Do you have rent if you pay for electric? Something has to give beyond today. You can\u2019t just leave jobs before you have some leeway in cash. You should save up money for emergencies if you were to get laid off. All that should factor into a future budget so you aren\u2019t spending all you make. \n\nFor now, you\u2019ll pay your bills a little late, maybe incur some fees, plan to spend less next month to quickly bounce back from that as you get paid. Pay off that loan ASAP so you don\u2019t have a waisted $68 in your budget each month going forward. I\u2019d advise against the credit card for now since you, no offense, aren\u2019t yet being disciplined with money if you\u2019re considering loans so quickly and often.

Normal service providers are often more understanding if you give them a head's up.",
            "I also suggest trying something like uber eats, uber and stuff of the like. I know we find ourselves in situations sometimes where we feel we must pull loans but if there is even the inkling of avoiding so and managing to take care of this try not to go in debt to fix debt.",

Then, next month pay the full amount plus the half from this month.\n\nSpeaking to them may chew that down even farther.

I worry for you. $6K in debt and nothing in savings or checking. This $500 issue will be fine. You\u2019ll defer payments and they\u2019ll accept them. Longer term, you\u2019ve got to find a way to earn more income. Side hustle, different job. I saw the vet tech commentary. Rover might be one of the best ways given your current experience.

I went to one that the first month they would pay you $700 if you went 7 times.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso most late payments usually don't show up on your credit until 30 days of non payment, but of course look up your loan terms, also some utility companies, it may take a few months before shut off but of course, check the agreement terms too.\u00a0",

If you can try to sell something or ask friends/family if they can spare anything towards that payment. \n\nYour electric bill should be fine if you call them and explain, it's very unlikely they'll shut off your electricity for a couple weeks late. Phone bill will probably also give you a grace period, but if not you can still connect to internet in public places if you don't have internet at your place. \n\nLoan is last priority, but also give them a call.",
            "Phone bill may let you pay late with a promise to pay by a certain date. Car insurance has a grace period (usually about 5 days) before it\u2019s considered late.

It\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s true, and the only way out will be to take steps to prevent this stuff from happening. If you wait until it all piles up and creates a bad financial situation for yourself in the present, it\u2019s going to be harder to get yourself out of a bad situation like this. You need to start thinking about the bigger picture.

Citi has a 0 interest credit card (Simplicity card) for balance transfers for 21 months, you can transfer the debt once you have enough $ to pay the transfer fee (3% of the balance transferred: $180). Then set up autopay to pay it off in equal installments (not minimum payments) (6k/21 months: $286/m). The transfer fee will be charged interest so best to pay that off right after the balance. The only downside with the strategy is that if you ever make a late payment, they\u2019ll charge you full interest for the full amount for the full time you owe them. But if you never miss a payment, you wont be dealing with high interest. The interest is why you feel you are drowning. \n\nStrategy 2: you can call your credit cards and negotiate for a smaller amount at a lower interest rate.  If they think they won\u2019t be paid at all sometimes they will work with you. This is not an easy route as they become unpleasant as soon as they smell a default. \n\nStrategy 3: earn more on a side job. \n\nGood luck!",

            "You're being classist.  Not everyone has an emergency fund, or a relative with money to lend them.\n\nOP says he's late on 4 bills, totaling ~$500.  Payday loan places generally charge ~$10 per $100 borrowed, so he'd pay $50 to take a loan.  Most bills charge late fees around $30, so being late on four bills will cost him $120.  So he can pay $50 to take a short-term loan or pay $120 to just be late on all his bills, and you're saying saving $70 is not a good option.\n\nMost places will waive a late fee if it's your first time being late and you ask nicely, so that's the first option.  But if they don't, the better option is the payday loan.  Of course it's possible to get caught in a bad cycle, but it's also possible to get caught in a bad situation with credit cards or mortgages or cars loans or any type of debt.  If you actually are already working a new job and know you will have the money in two weeks and have the dedication to immediately put your paycheck towards paying the loan, payday loans can be the best option.  Sure if you annualize the interest rate it's like 400% but in reality it's $50 for two weeks vs $120 in late fees for two weeks.\n\nSome people just grew up with parents who could always bail them out and don't get that some people don't have options to get that $500 for two weeks.  But payday loans absolutely have their place for people trying to build up their credit and emergency fund who just need a short-term stopgap.  \n\nThere are actually surveys on this, with rich people who have never lived paycheck to paycheck bc mommy and daddy paid for their college or first car thinking payday loans should be banned to save those stupid poor people who clearly don't understand interest rates from their own ignorance.  Meanwhile a massive portion of low income people don't want them to be banned because they *do* understand interest rates, understand paying $50 is lower than paying $120, and understand no one else is going to lend to them for those short-term bridge loans if they can't charge enough interest to make up for all the people who don't pay it back.",

Then, when you don't need it anymore, sell it on the island for about what you initially paid since everything is so inflated in the Caribbean [due to being islands].\n\nThe alternative here is what you suggested: lease on the island.

That means your cost is $7200 minus $5k for selling your car now= you are out $2200 for a new car and no maintenance.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you ship your car. It costs $3500 to ship plus $2000 for a new cat converter, and (for the sake of argument) you can sell it for $9k.

It can be profitable, but isn't guaranteed profit.\n\nI guessing ops not considering the number of customers his car can appeal to where he's at vs where he's going.

If you ship the current car it costs 2.5k to get there with a decent chance you could use it a majority of the time you are there and still sell it at the end of the stint. Assuming you can sell it for 2.5k or more at the end that makes this a break even or net positive money wise. Either buying a car there or leasing is gonna cost a decent bit and if you buy a car there you have to still sell at the end or ship it back for 2.5k. Money wise I'd say shipping it is the best choice but ease wise would be a lease",

Because really, if I was making this offer and didn't get anything in writing, I'd assume I'm making a gift (the last time I'd give the recipient a gift, probably) , and anything they bother to repay me is a bonus.",
            "You either have no experience or are being naive here. This can go belly up in a lot of different ways for OP. We already know OP is at a disadvantage financially compared to their relative, relative can change the terms at any point, even use OPs higher monthly payment as proof they agreed on a different interest rate rather than 0. \n\nIf I\u2019m the relative, I actually would appreciate OP putting it in writing that they would pay me back. It gives me a little safety net if OP tries to not pay or delay payments etc. Having agreements spelled out is for the protection of both parties, especially important in a familial situation where there is more than just the money at stake.",
            "Like I said, maybe in this specific case OP bought too much car.  That's a separate issue from you claiming he should've never taken a 21% loan.",
            "Committing 89% of your income to fixed costs is insanely poor planning. It's fine to commit a percentage of your extra income to paying down debt, but exchanging flexibility just because there's a cost to that flexibility is blatantly claiming that safety and flexibility is somehow worthless.\n\nMaybe it's worthless when you don't need it. But sometimes you do, that's why insurance exists. People telling op to sign up for the $1500 car payment won't have to pay his/her rent if it goes up $600 because their lease doesn't get renewed and they move to a pricier spot, or if they end up in the hospital and have an unplanned medical expense.",
            "Yeah, I can find them too if I hunt around (though I wouldn't touch some of those vehicles without a mechanic examining it first).\n\nSome of those cheap cars are far from deals.  \n[Here's a great price on a used money pit](https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/cto/d/brooklyn-2003-mercedes-s600-93k-miles/7759125906.html), and [one that's great except painful on gas](https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/cto/d/arverne-2010-volvo-xc60-awd-32l-6cyl/7759116868.html), and there's [this one that's actually a good deal if it's mechanically sound](https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/cto/d/forest-hills-2008-honda-accord-exl/7758858638.html).\n  \nIt's not that they aren't out there, it's that they're not *as readily available as they used to be* (and if you want something with a dealer warranty so the first surprise maintenance headache isn't three car payments worth of repairs they're virtually nonexistent). Again, *the data says they're not widely available* - if they were the mean and median used car prices wouldn't be what they are because the cheap cars would be driving the numbers down.\n\nI agree that paying OP's frankly usurious interest rate is an absurd waste of money, and folks should not be out there buying \"more car than they can afford\" (which OP didn't do - they can easily afford their car payment, they're just getting utterly screwed on interest), but I think \"Just get something cheap off craigslist\" isn't always a realistic option either.",
            "Yeah but the point is you don\u2019t have 15k \u201cright now\u201d",

            "my dad helped me out with essentially a bridge loan to buy a property during COVID craziness. He pulled the money from a HELOC, so I only reimbursed him for the interest. Lost my job during the process, so after the refi, I still owed him about 65k, he agreed to a 2 year amort on it and I paid it off in 1 with a lump sum after I had built up enough to still have some cushion after I paid him",
            "Yeah for sure. I would just feel bad about asking for more, but it\u2019s super dependent on the relationship and is probably not an issue here",
            "Much like if the vehicle was stolen or totaled *now* OP would still have to repay the loan - just to their relative, not a bank charging outrageous interest.\n\nThat's what theft and collision coverage on your car insurance is for. There is no additional risk here.",

If a mom said to her kids \"Here's $20, you and your brother go see a movie\" it'd be perfectly reasonable to respond \"2 tickets will run us $25 nowadays\". \n\nCertainly haggling is bad.  But so is having closed lines of communications.  Maybe they don't recognize the hardship and are perfectly eager to go further.  I would be insulted if someone didn't feel comfortable talking to me if I was to offer them a gift.  It would imply that we are not as close as I thought.",

If the relative were to next year change his mind and say \"oh you owe interest\", the lack of the contract cuts both ways and the proper answer is simply \"no\". There's no way to impose that interest without a contract saying so.\n\nAll of the risk is on the lender. Always is.",
            "If you're 40 and committing 89% of your income to a mortgage yes that's poor planning.  If you're in your early twenties and the majority of your money is going to fixed bills, you're normal.  Again this is only going to last a year and change and then he'll be free.\n\nAnd let's not pretend his options are commit 10% of his income or 89% of his income.  You seem to be ignoring that bit.  His options are commit 89% of his income for 16 months, or 70% of his income for six years.  It's really not that hard of a decision, budget tightly for a year when you're young or budget tightly for most of your 20s and pay $19k in interest.",
            "> \"Just get something cheap off craigslist\" isn't always a realistic option either.\n\nI never said just anything cheap off Craigslist. \n\nYou're playing the cup is half empty.and there's nothing between good value and overpaying a dealer + high interest rate. \n\nAnd any luxury brand that's 20+ years old is usually never a value, so that MB is a complete waste of time for someone looking for value when buying a car.\n\nAnd yes, buying a used car from a private party requires a due diligence, but there's still decent options in the 5-10k for people who don't have the ability to afford 25k+",
            "And you wouldn't likely need it all for repairs \"right now.\"  You save the $300 difference in the note, and if you need it for repairs then you've got it.  If you don't need it for repairs then you've got more money to put down on your next vehicle when you trade up.  And you will earn interest instead of paying interest.",
            "Other thing is, if they have a good relationship (likely they do since they were offered 25k!) if something happened to OP like job change or medical expense whatever they would likely be flexible. Not so with a bank or financial institution.",
            "Even with full collision coverage, the blue book value of the car is what the insurance company would pay.   That is very often less than the loan value.",
            ">25k is not much to help family if you are not struggling\n\nWe come from vastly different families, my man. I'm in the same camp as u/I-seddit, to go back with a counter offer would be a little insulting. This to me would be a red flag if I was the person offering, and would make me reconsider the offer. If they're willing to ask and change the terms once, what's stopping them from asking to change the terms later on down the road? When that happens, especially with family, it can sour things. \n\nFurther, just because someone can \"afford it\", doesn't mean that it's okay to not pay them back or pay them back \"when you can\". A deal is a deal, and if you don't hold up your end, then you're just not a trustworthy person.",

Regardless of culture. \n\nWhere we disagree most is you think that just because someone is loaded, they just want to help and the expectation of repayment is not a huge deal that could go either way. \n\nIf that were the case, they would not have laid out a time period in which it needed to be paid back. They would have either just gifted them the money, or told them to pay back when they could. The fact they had a payment plan tells me the expectation is that it's paid back on time.",
