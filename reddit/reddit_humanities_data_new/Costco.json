            "**Request** \\- Since we often get questions on r/Costco asking when the last time a product was on sale - if each person commenting could pick one or a few items (ideally in order) and comment with the item name, item number, any limits, and discount amount, we could hopefully crowdsource a resource that can be used in the future for when an item was when on sale in the past. Or if anybody has a suggestion for an easier way to document past sales?\n\n**I'll start with an example:**\n\n**Item Name**\\- Haagen Dazs Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almond Ice Cream Bars, 3 fl oz, 15-count\n\n**Item Number -**  112218\n\n**Limit** \\- No limit\n\n**Discount Amount** \\- $3.50 off 6/19/24 - 7/21/24",

            "An important bit, check your date code to see if your charger is affected by this recall, not all dates are:\n\n\"The recalled portable chargers have a date code printed on the outer surface of the wall prong. Date codes are a 4-digit number in the WWYY format, where WW is the sequential week of the year and YY is the last two digits of the manufacturing year. Date codes included in this recall end with 21 or 22, or are one of the following four date codes ending in 23: 0123, 0923, 1523, or 1723.\"",

            "I almost bought in then got lured by the competitor because it had a free mini carabiner attached",
            "Not the first portable charger recall",
            "Oh wow. I've actually been eyeing that item for years but could never justify the price, almost bought one for a Christmas gift to my parents who live in a wood cabin. Yikes.",
            "While they have good deals, the random small electronics, hubs, or chargers at Costco seem to be just as crappy quality as random no name ones from Amazon.",
            "Welp I just bought two of the 1500mA chargers this week. This one's not listed, but I'm gonna play it safe and return it",

            "This is interesting - MILLIONS sold, two fail - recall.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t known - where these two dropped or beat up and then plugged in to charge?  Were they submerged in water and then plugged in?\n\nI agree, there is a risk, but I have owned two of these chargers for awhile and they work relatively well.",

            "Same! I got an email from Costco with recall instructions, and it *appears* that they\u2019re sending a replacement. I really hope so, cause I loved my charger!",
