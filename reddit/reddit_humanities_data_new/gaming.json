            "I remember at a panel when this was news either Burnie Burns or Gus Sorola of Rooster Teeth basically said that if a kid is smart enough to download the GTA Hot Coffee mod, mod their PS2 and install it they are probably smart enough to go to Google and type in 'titties'.",

            "The difference between hot coffee and bg3 is that the hot coffee was unused and unrated code inside the game. When modders found it in the pc version the esrb board re-evaluated the game and increased its rating. Adding on top of that bad faith news reporting as if the content was accessible by anyone including children(which honestly shouldn't have been playing it in the first place based on the esrb rating) leading to many outraged parents who didn't properly understand the situation.  \n\nWhile BG3 was well just out there with its content... Including bears. Anyone checking the game would reasonably know the content was there.",

            "The interesting thing is, GTA:SA would probably still be AO under the current rules.\n\nThe ESRB's beef with it wasn't *that the game contained sexual content and nudity, generally speaking.* Hell, as-is, the game didn't actually have nudity in those bits (they didn't get around to making naked skins for CJ and the girls for it before they pulled the plug on the feature, you have to mod the PC version to have that). Their beef was that, on top of that, it was a literal interactive sex minigame.\n\nThe only game I've ever seen have an interactive sex minigame and *not* get AO is Saints Row 2, which went out of its way to be as non-explicit as possible about it (you see it from the outside of the vehicle like picking up prostitutes in those GTA games, the sex noises are deliberately unrealistic and goofy, and the minigame doesn't directly tie into graphic details of what you're doing). Meanwhile, games have been getting away with tits and sex scenes at M since the mid-90s, so long as there's not straight-up a sex minigame associated with them (lest we forget Phantasmagoria and Fear Effect).",

They were garbage parents who blamed music and other media for school shootings instead of admitting personal accountability as parents.

            "I feel like the real crime was not telling the ESRB that it was in the game.  AO was punitive.  I don't think it was necessarily about the specific content more that it was hidden. \n\nAlso I don't see a penis in Baldur's Gate..  \"Nudity is artistic... if it's a woman\"  (You technically don't in GTA but it's implied.)",

            "The same thing happened with Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on a less horny scale.  The ESRB just doesn't like being mislead intentionally or not, about your game content.  Rockstar did a crappy job of cutting the accessibility to the code since a GameShark could easily circumvent it.",
            "I love that all the sex is optional. Like you CAN be a inter-species fuck machine. Or, you can cold shoulder everyone. Nice choice.\n\nIs it weird that I don't find it... interesting? because the in-game models still act like plastic dolls. Nothing hangs right.",
            "Admittedly I\u2019m a little young to have lived through the Hot Coffee controversy, but iirc wasn\u2019t it only pulled from the shelves because it was actually in the game? Like the ESRB tried to claim they were skirting around rating rules?",

It was pulled from shelves as part of a recall because all the assets for Hot Coffee were meant to be removed from the game prior to release and didn't causing the game to re-rated to A for Adults by the ESRB thus causing it to essentially die\n\nC.)

            "> so its just stupid that it caused just a controversy and got slapped with an unnecessary AO rating\n\nWhile I agree the whole thing was stupid, it's worth noting that the ESRB was right to get upset that a sex minigame was discovered in the game files without ever being disclosed to them. If they had given it a pass, I guarantee other dev teams would just start lying about the content of their games in order to get a more desirable rating. While I assume Rockstar would have removed them entirely if they had the foresight, I also assume that if they had told the ESRB about it during the rating process, things would have gone much better for them in the long run. The scandal happened because the files were discovered in the finished product that hundreds of thousands of customers had already bought.",
            "Rockstar should have done a better job of cleaning their code.  It wasn't just PC, people found a way to get pro action replay hacks for it on consoles too.  That's just sloppy work.",

            "> so its just stupid that it caused just a controversy and got slapped with an unnecessary AO rating\n\nThe problem with the \"Hot Coffee\" mod is that it showed the game contained content that wasn't declared to the ratings board that happened to be adult content, and it shipped with that content. All content needs to be declared, whether easily accessible or not, this was compounded by it being functional once modded.",
            "The funniest thing about Hot Coffee is that this unused content found its way into the Definitive Edition, despite it being removed by the post release patches of the original game.",
            "Funny thing... I worked at a Movie, Music, Game store at this time. I vaguely recall my store being one of the very rare ones that did NOT recall the game or remove it from shelves. We were sent special black/white A/O stickers we added to the case. I don't know the legality of this, but it happened. And yeah, even that was dumb. We eventually got normal, republished versions later.",
            "That totally sounds like something Gus would say lol",
            "To be fair, you didn't have to mod anything on PS2. It was just a simple gameshark code that unlocked the content. It already existed on the disc.",

            "Yeah, I remember BioWare sex scenes being regarded as quite controversial. Especially because they included homosexual romance options too.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason why all non-heterosexual options are just side characters and not your companions (with the only exception being Liara, and only because they used the caveat of \u201eAsari are all female and they can mate with anyone\u201d). \n\nThat\u2019s how controversial it was at the time. They were actually somewhat of a pioneer in normalizing sex scenes in video games.\n\nEDIT: Completely forgot about Kaidan, but yeah, he was retconned into being bi and it happened in ME3 when it was already pretty much acceptable",

            "It also caught some unfair flak, as some news outlets carelessly reported that Mass Effect depicted sexual violence.\n\nHere's the wildest part of the entire story, in my opinion. Noted \"video games are murder simulators\" nutcase Jack Thompson, of all the people in the world, crawled out of the woodwork to defend the game from the inaccurate criticism ([source](https://www.engadget.com/2008-01-28-jack-thompson-mass-effect-controversy-ridiculous.html)). If nothing else, I suppose he felt that that kind of slander would only hurt his cause's credibility.",
            "Why? And by whom?",
            "Gotta love that several homosexual options were removed from the games to avoid backlash because Fox News went all in on saying there were \"graphic sex scenes\" and called it an \"alien sex simulator\".\n\nAnd then you play the game and the \"graphic sex scenes\" is some suggestive crawling, a fade to black, and cuddling. Oh and it happens once per game if you go out of your way to romance someone.\n\nThankfully in ME1 at least, the voice lines for both Shepards are still in the game so modders were able to restore the homosexual options.",
            "Close. The word is \"flak.\"",
            "That was the dumbest contraversy. I mean, people were straight up 100% lying.\n\nI remember playing the game half expecting at least some boobs or something, and the actual sex scene is no worse than what you see in a PG-13 movie.",

So existing copies had to be pulled from shelves and re-rated AO, and future copies were released with the content removed so they could be rated M again.

It's hard to believe this all went down 15-20 years ago now, but reading through some of these articles is definitely a trip down memory lane of what we had going on internally.\n\nI didn't remember that we were being investigated by the feds, but I do somewhat recall Hillary Clinton being involved with Jack Thompson's campaign, as well as the California-specific attempts to add additional measures to the ESRB rating system. Part of the allure of the ESRB/PEGI is that they're self-governing bodies independent from government regulation, and they are very strict about the ratings they dole out in order to keep it that way. Having official red tape would undoubtedly stifle innovation and creativity within the industry (some countries do have their own sets of laws that dictate further restrictions, and it does have implications on development, oftentimes adding delays to address specific elements, such as Germany not allowing depictions of blood, dead bodies or any Nazi symbolism). That's what made the hot coffee incident such a big deal because it threatened the very fabric of free enterprise for video games at a time when the industry was being scapegoated for school shootings and child violence.\n\nAll of the first party console companies take the ratings systems very seriously. All of them have a full-stop standards requirement against any Adults Only (AO) rated games from being released on their systems. Once the hot coffee mod went mainstream the ESRB had to take a hard stance and slap AO on it given what was at stake in the surrounding political climate at the time. That's what prompted the recall here in the US. I'd be a little surprised if it weren't the same in at least some parts of the EU.\n\nAs I mentioned, the incident essentially forced the ESRB to change their policies, partly in order to keep their status and reputation intact. There was a good 2+ month period following the judgment against us where they put a stop order on all certificates being issued for *everyone*. The first parties will not greenlight publishing without that certificate, so: no ratings, no games.

Modded Skyrim was still wildly popular thanks to the longevity granted to it by modders so the anti-modding sentiment they held really rubbed everyone the wrong way.

Normal guns might work, sure, but so would literally pushing someone far away or cracking their helmets. These space suits at most protect against essentially a fall, not gunshots or projectiles moving faster than sound. And in zero G id expect weapons to have 0 recoil, or for recoil to push me back like in the defunct game Law Breakers. Camouflage, high impact armor, and some physics math would prove important for maybe some more ambushing attacks, and camouflage might just be a black, reflective suit with absorbent material.\n\nMaybe take The Expanse TV show and turn that into a game.

In a good game the one who is lagging should be at a disadvantage. Their character should update on the server based on their last input and interpolation should try to figure out the \"missing data\". In a bad game, the lag allows them to see into the future because the data they receive allows them to look around a corner and shoot before the server realizes they're not in real time. This would look to the person that died that they got shot possibly even before the other player came around the corner. I'm not sure what it was in this particular game but it's not horribly rare to see lag benefit the lagger. It can also do things like cause the lagger to stagger around the place, making it impossible to know their real position and hit them.

Review bombing is leaving a negative review not in line with your actual experiences.\n\nAnd who gets to make the call on that?\n\n> Review bombing is when you have a few, very specific complaints about a game that is otherwise good, but you don't feel like an honest review would be impactful enough, so you downplay the good, overemphasize the bad, and act like a decent game is unrealistically bad. \n\nSo because the issues others have with a game are not an issue to you it is review bombing to leave a negative review? If a game has great story but the gameplay is awful then people who focus on gameplay are going to leave negative reviews.\n\n> What I'm saying is a lot of solid 6-7/10 games end up with a ton of 0-1/10 user reviews.

The classic Halo games are a better example in my opinion, since the NPCs are more adaptive when it comes to things like behaviour and pathfinding. \n\nThings really just get much harder when you have to involve multiple players and networking concepts (many developers/publishers don't want to shell out extra money for servers that can handle the performance load of having good bots, for example).",

Fun games if you like difficulty.\n\nLegend of Zelda has more plot, idk why souls fan insists on analyzing why the curtains are blue and trying to make up a plot in their head. No one plays the souls games for the plot",
            "I didn't say it was better. I said that \"they're both extremely strong in the narrative department\".\n\nI'm sick of this counter-snobby attitude that because something is challenging to understand or enjoy, it must be meaningless pretentious garbage. As it turns out, people like making complex and difficult things, and other people enjoy unravelling the nuance in complex and difficult things. Some people act like everything they don't immediately \"get\" must either be conceptually vacuous critic bait or part of some huge money laundering conspiracy, and it's bullshit. It's lazy. It's an excuse, to avoid the effort of learning and growing as a person.\n\nYou don't have to like everything, but at least try to figure out why you don't like it. Don't assume that the thing itself is at fault because of what it is.",
            "And yet it\u2019s still a better game than Elden Ring",

            "Why wouldn't I like that? Good for them.\n\nJust because I'm personally not a fan of an art style doesn't mean I'm cheering for their demise. Glad they found an audience and get to make a living creating comics people love!",

            "I think this is just a way to excuse bad design.\n\n\nIf I put down the game for two three weeks or even more because life got in the way, it's fucked up that I don't have any idea what to do. That is not the game being difficult, that is the game not communicating enough and it's not really what makes a game fun.\u00a0\n\n\nI have nothing against enemies being hard to kill, but I do want to be able to get a bit more information. Map markers, quest log, I don't know. But something more. I had to follow videos and guides just to find and to go the correct places.\u00a0\n\n\nI think their quest design and style works in a linear game like dark souls, but it do not work well in an open world game.\n\n\nIt's kind of ironic too because I'd wager a good majority play souls games because of their fights, boss designs, weapons and skills, not because of the vague non-story that's barely there. I definitely didn't care about the story, I just wanted to fight enemies, but of course I wanted to progress as well so I could beat the game.",
            ">Quest design\n\nGranted I've not played the second one yet, But they are the last people who get to say anything about quest design. I swear 90% of the first games side quests broke down to \"Go to location, Fight small group of pissant enemies, Use focus. Return to quest giver.",
            "I guess I'm just a sucker for snowy areas. \n\nThe crystalized lake was pretty cool, and really liked how the giant wolf boss would ambush you throughout the level.",
            "So. What. We weren't talking about the best reviewed dlc unless you're blind and can't read. We were talking about the gold standard for DLCs which both the Witcher 3 and other FS games accomplished. I didn't even say anything bad about Elden Ring when the white knights came out of the woodworks to jump on my back because I didn't get on my knees and cry about how good Shadow of the Erdtree is.",

            "I'm saying that developer was never jealous, or bitched about the game. No one did, because it was a great game. But people act like he said it was a bad game and hated it. And even if he did hate it, who fucking cares. \n\nIf you don't like that he just accepted it thats perfectly fine. I just don't like the made up narrative that a bunch of developers cried about a game being too good and that they want games to become worse. It was a bullshit headline that never was true, thanks to IGN. \n\nTruth is, games are a business like any one else. Publishers will want their moneys worth. And they wont accept red numbers even if they might get green later, when they can get green numbers earlier. It would be nice if that changed, but I don't really see it happening, not as long as they will get green numbers with broken games anyway. That's why AA studios have been on the rise the last 4-5 years.\n\nHell, even studios who manage to release bangers will be dissolved, see Microsoft and Hi Fi Rush. AAA will never have the same opportunity in that kind of environment.",
            "For sure, but I don't think that comment was about quest content but more \"how do I know what to do?\". If a Ubisoft game never told me to go fight a guy but just expected me to do it, that would be bad quest design as well.\n\nBut thats just me guessing.",

            "I understand, I think we are conditioned to see gaming stories as having to follow a set narrative, either by railroading the player (the Half-Life method) or by having loads of cutscenes (the Rockstar method). Both of these methods are about wrestling control away from the player. \n\nWe do this because that\u2019s how movies tell their stories, and that\u2019s all we understand how to do. But games aren\u2019t movies, they have unique traits that mean they can follow different story techniques. \n\nGame\u2019s stories thrive on player-driven agency and exploration. And no one does that better then Fromsoft. Dark souls doesn\u2019t hold your hand and tell you a story. It creates a massive complicated world and characters and then let\u2019s you discover it yourself. \n\nAlso: Dark souls/bloodbourne might be some of the best surrealist cosmic horror stories we\u2019ve gotten since literal Lovecraft.",

            "Having a world around you is not the same as having a story. That's like saying destiny 1s grimoires create a great story. No, they create a setting, but theory crafting a plot together from how an enemy looks or a description on a piece of armor does not constitute a good story.\n\nRabid fromsoft fans are the worst. Always trying to come up with some excuse as to why their games are a masterpiece whether it be the terrible casting system, something as simple as a HUD, or trying to explain that making up a plot makes it the best one. Nah you just got pulled into the hypetrain. No one buys a from soft game for the plot and that's fact"
