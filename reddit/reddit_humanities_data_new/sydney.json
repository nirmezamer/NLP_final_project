The way I see it, if you have so much more time on the road, you should be more used to the conditions. I've driven for work before and I can say I figured out how to operate around cars who often would drive erratically or just plain badly, but I think with the case of buses, it's almost more than guaranteed that the problem is in the driver's seat of the bus than it is of the public.",

He was taking his sweet time just pretty much just standing in the road and didn\u2019t look before stepping out. \nI\u2019m not talking about the roads where the sign says to give way for pedestrians or where there is a crossing and the lights are green but the green man is also showing. \nJust regular side roads off of main roads. \n\nIn the UK the rules have just recently changed where pedestrians now have right of way but because it\u2019s not been that way forever, most drivers are unaware and I\u2019ve lived my whole life giving way to cars. Also I don\u2019t want to end up as road kill. \n\nCurious about what is right over here.",

            "One of the first things I noticed when I started driving a few years ago was how little bus drivers indicate. Majority of the time there is no indicating for 5 seconds. It's indicate and start pulling out",
            "It\u2019s a bonkers rule that there\u2019s different rules for different vehicles on the same road. Blew my mind when I first got to Sydney. Found out about it the usual way, a bus just pulled out in front of my after indicating for one second, like it was a magic wand or something.",
            "So to be clear when the bus pulls into the bus stop and immediately indicates to leave the bus stop while picking up passengers I am expected to just stop there behind them and wait until they actually pull out?",
            "I like the buses that leave the kerb with zero indication and force you into oncoming peak hour traffic when youve past 3/4  of their length then ride their horn   - almost as if theyre blaming you for not using their insanely overpriced, overcrowded and ultimately inconveneient service.",
            "Sydney drivers are absolute shite but even we respect the buses.",
            "I would give way if getting past was an option. \n\nBut, I'd like to ask our lovely and dedicated bus drivers to also pull off to the side when stopping at a bus stop. Last couple of days I've been stuck behind two buses that just pointed its nose in but left it's arse blocking the lane.\n There was time and space to get more parallel, seemed like, just don't wanna..",

            "Yes a couple of things are  confusing and disruptive ..  bus drivers usually signal when leaving their stop even if not leaving their lane, forcing cars in adjacent lanes to stop.  Also, buses often sit at a stop with their flashers on that other drivers may mistake for wanting to come into your lane. The give-way law makes sense but they need to fix those problems with bus driving etiquette to make it less confusing.",
            "It's easier if you know the routes. I know if the 270, forex, is just pulling out or if it's about to change lanes when and where because I used to take it all the time.",
            "I\u2019m glad the majority of comments on this post have correctly pointed out that impatient bus drivers are often the problem.",
            "Yeh this is the real issue. While busses have right of way that doesn\u2019t give them the right to turn their blinker on and pull out regardless of who\u2019s in the next lane or observing what speed they\u2019re doing. Drivers shouldn\u2019t be expected to jam on the brakes.",
            "Also that when they have room to pull the whole bus in, not just leave their ass hanging across the next lane",
            "This happened to me. I was halfway up the bus, nowhere to go. He put his indicator on and just pulled straight out. I was pushed into the oncoming lane in front of a round-about. Luckily no one was in that lane. Then looked at me as if I was at fault. Like, mate, did you even look? Where am I meant to go?",
            "Yeah but to be fair Sydney car drivers do that shit all the time. I'm literally the only person I know who signals when she's about to change lanes, instead of waiting until I'm already changing lanes. I hardly expect bus drivers to be any different here.",
            "OP themselves is so aggressive for no reason, pretty indicative of the average bus driver in my opinion",
            "Or how many drivers in Sydney think an indicator means they can just start gliding into my lane and I'm the dickhead because I don't automatically pump the brakes to let them in. \n\nThe levels of entitlement in this city are out of control. \n\nYou wanna change lanes, find a gap and then speed up or slow down and MERGE.  Don't just try to glide into my lane or drive next to me for a kilometre and look over at me frantically like I'm being a meaniehead. You can just slow down and move over \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "They do where I live. I'm so used to Sydney drivers not using their blinkers until they're already merging that it legit makes me nervous.",
            "I do every single time.\nMy system is indicate as soon as I\u2019ve pressed the button to close the front door, that takes about 3 seconds, then it\u2019s another 3 seconds for the sequence of door brake release, handbrake and accelerator touch until the bus can even begin to move, adding on mirror and blind spot checks.\nOn average for me it\u2019s at least 7 seconds until I start to move.\nAt least 30 times a day I have near misses wth drivers that either don\u2019t understand the give way rule, or don\u2019t care and just want to get in front of the bus.\nIt\u2019s especially fun at sunrise and sunset when the sun is reflecting of your mirror and you are pretty much driving blind.\n\nThe incident today that inspired the post was a car that missed slamming into me by inches, blasted his horn at me, despite the fact that I\u2019d sat in the bus stop and indicated for well over 10 seconds, let 2 cars go and started moving slowly before the 3rd car where there was a decent enough gap and plenty of space if he\u2019d just slowed down.\n\nAt the end of the day I know it\u2019s a big joke to everyone and you think we are all assholes, but let me assure you that it\u2019s a really common cause of accidents, and 99% of the time the car not giving way is the one that is found at fault.\nWe not only have cameras on every angle of the bus, inside and out, but all buses also have a data recorder which shows the buses speed, how fast they were going, how long they were indicating, whether they were braking during accidents.\nSo good luck with that.",

            "Sorry, but you didn't explain how. \n\nIf you're complaining about energy providers shouldn't be getting subsidised while increasing prices I could understand. However if anything the subsidies should increase their margins and reduce the need for CPI, but you're saying the subsidies are causing price increases so I still don't see the link.",
            "Right, will check them out and compare. Thanks!",
            "I mean it balances out in the end. You\u2019ll save on your electricity bill but be spending more on your gas bill.",
            "Not 24/7. But usual usage. We also have washer and dryer thaf runs regularly.",
            "Do you use gas for your hot water and cooking? I can't fathom the power bill being that low otherwise.",
            "Nah, it's the use of 'hella'",
            "Yes, we have gas cooking & hot water. Our gas bill averages $110pq.",
            "I\u2019m not complaining, just saying that we never had these ridiculous power bills for most of my 65 years when our only source of power was coal generated.",
            "Yeah thats it, i notice it alot more now we have eliminated gas completely from our place",
            "All electric cooking.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how the hot water works here, maybe it\u2019s all covered by strata. There\u2019s no tank anywhere in the unit or our garage.\n\nWe also have no A/C and very light usage of heaters.",
            "was that before or after they were privatised by the state government ?",
            "Hot water can comprise a significant chunk of the electricity bill, so that makes sense -- maybe strata puts it on each apartment's quarterly strata fees instead.",
            "Both"
