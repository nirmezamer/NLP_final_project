Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you\u2019d just like some recommendations on new gear?\n\nThere are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don\u2019t actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don\u2019t be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.\n\nYou can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",

            "Hey espresso team!\n\nRecent at home barista in training and I have several questions\n\nI have the Gaggia Classic espresso machine paired with the Niche grinder, and I'm having an issue with water pooling at the top of the espresso puck at the end of my pulls.\n\nI have the grinder setting on fine (anywhere from 7-10 dots... I recognize this \"scale\" may not be universal) and I turn on the water flow pretty much until I see the water turn slightly clear. When I take the portafilter off, there's a pool of water at the top of the espresso puck. Am I doing anything wrong here? I also noticed that it takes a long time for the espresso to actually start to pour (I use those acupuncture needles to break up the clumps, distribute, and tamp down). Espresso itself tastes fine. I don't use a puck screen although I did get one.\n\nAlso question on milk steaming (we use oat milk) I watched some helpful youtube videos and read comments on here and I was able to correct an issue I was having of the steamer being painfully loud. And I am getting good foam now. But I noticed when I pour the foam stays at the top of the jug when tilted and only the warm milk pours. Are there any remedies for that or again, is that normal?\n\nSorry for the lengthy post. Thank you in advance!",
            "I\u2019m not sure if my thoughts on extraction with espresso are correct:\n\nMy thought is, that given a certain temperature and a given bean, only time controls extraction. Yes I can grind finer or coarser, but as long as I keep the pull time constant, extraction will be approximately constant? So grind size regulates the type of drink (ristretto, lungo etc). \n\nIs this true? If my shot is bitter and I\u2019m already down at 80 C, should I decrease pull time as a first measure?",
            "You pull a shot until the water runs clear?\n\nWater may be pooling in your basket if it's underfilled or if your grind is too fine. It's not a problem if you don't mind the taste or the clean up. This is assuming your machine has a functioning 3-way solenoid. I think some of the Classics may not have one depending on the build year. If that's the case then water pooling is normal.\n\nYou may not be incorporating your foam enough. You should aerate until the pitcher feels as warm as your hand, then incorporate the rest of the time. Your pitcher should not be overfilled either which helps with the incorporation step.",
            "Water on puck issue: you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, it\u2019s a dosing/basket size issue only. The more headspace you have in your puck, coupled with a fine grind, the more water you\u2019ll get up top. \n\nJust use the puck screen for this very reason, your used puck will be easier to dispense of and the portafilter and group head will be easier to clean.\n\nFrothing issue: this is an over-steaming issue. You\u2019re steaming too much. Have you noticed how some baristas split the milk, i.e. pour milk from one jug to another? This will also help you in eliminating some of the hard froth, but most of the time the milk is gone, just start over.\n\nMilk steaming takes a long time to master. Be patient. When the jug gets too hot to touch, you\u2019re done. Once done, place the jug on the bench and knock out the excess air, then stir rigorously.",
            "Yield determines the type of drink. How long someone wants to brew in order to reach that yield will be based on taste preference. One person may brew a lungo in 30s, another 50s, or whatever. \n\nWhat kind of coffee are you brewing? What was your starting brew temp, yield, and time? I assume it was bitter so you decided to lower the temp instead of adjusting the yield or brew time?"

            "My understanding was that there was a very small amount of steamed milk in a macchiato, the dot of foam on top was so it was \u201cmarked\u201d, because it was indifferentiable from an espresso by looking. I thought the difference was a drop of milk vs a 1:1 ratio?",
            "That\u2019s debatable. This can also be considered a macchiato, even if it has a tiny bit of milk poured into it. Generally a cortado is a little bigger than this (about 130ml). I work a speciality cafe and our macchiatos are like this with a little bit of milk poured in and then the foam on top, but they\u2019re a bit less full than this. It seems closer to a macchiato to a cortado to me",
            "Espresso macchiato is of italian origin, cortado is originally spanish, but as with all drinks of espresso + milk, they don\u2019t really have a fixed recipe and can be more or less the same. \n\nThe amount of milk in a cortado can vary between espresso macchiato and cappuccino but is usually somewhat in between. \n\nIt is true that the milk is an cortado can be very flat, untexturized but honestly, I havent seen that in spain in a long time.

I can't tell if this is creepy, or just a sad attempt at humor. \n\nLiterally no one cares about being good at latte art. Is this your first hobby? Anyone could work one shift at a cafe and be quite good pretty quickly. These are not hard to obtain skills, it's just a matter of practice and time. And that's what you're judging them for? The amount of time they've been in a hobby? Like if I were to judge you for not being able to solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute, you'd likely say \"who cares?\". Precisely. People see someone speed solve a cube \"oh neat. Cool\", someone buys a coffee with nice latte art, or sees you make them one \"oh neat. Cool\". \n\nGives big second hand embarrassment vibes.

            "Yup. Just my personal taste, man.\n\nImportant thing is the good equipment.",
            "Make sure to use the maker test \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udee1",
            "They were aligned but I recently had to change the batteries and I didn\u2019t noticed they were like that.",

            "Laser level ftw",
            "Yes. My feelings exactly. The DF 64 gen 2 is amazing. Almost zero retention",
            "I haven\u2019t yet. I had a dedica before and it only worked for medium dark to dark. I finishing my medium roast and then I\u2019m going to experiment with light roasts. I think it will work very well because the pid is very accurate and maintains the temperature.",
            "Medium and dark roasts basically. But I want to try a light roast. What\u2019s your grinder?",
            "Looks much better \ud83d\ude01 \n\nOff topic, buy any roaster recommendations to get beans in Portugal?",
            "Thank you! I'm hopeful it does also, could you let me know what you brew and how that goes?\n\nI am also considering the odyssey argos and meticulous, yet I'd want to wait until they are released to market before I pre order or back them. I also realize the profitec brand is reliable and German designed/built so that is a big plus.",
            "Same one df64 gen 2.\n\nI've mostly been trying 18-19g in the double basket. Couples with a grind between 17-20 and extractions of 31-33g over 25-30 seconds.",
            "Well I bought from flor da selva and they\u2019re ok. I like Buraca Roasters as well. But mainly I\u2019ve been purchasing my beans abroad.",
            "Thanks for the recommendations I will give them a try."
