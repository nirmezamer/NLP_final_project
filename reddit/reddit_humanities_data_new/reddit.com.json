            "Here's the judge's decision via Wired: [ACLU v. Dept. of Defense (S.D. N.Y. Oct. 5, 2011)](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/10/cianocontempt.pdf). One particularly intriguing/appalling excerpt regarding the destruction of the tapes:\n\n\n\"The email suggests that the CIA's General Counsel, John Rizzo, had not received advance notice of the videotapes' destruction: \"Rizzo found out today this had occurred as [sic] was upset - apparently because he had not been consulted - not sure if there was another reason. He raised at DO update but was 'calmed' (only slightly) when told [redacted] had approved.\" ld. **The email explains that, later in the day, Jose Rodriguez had approached CIA Director Porter Goss, the email's sender, and someone else whose identity also was redacted, to explain[] that he [Jose] felt it was extremely important to destroy the tapes.\" Id. Rodriguez allegedly said \"that if there was any heat he would take it,\" at which Goss purportedly \"laughed and said that actually, it would be he, [Goss], who would take the heat,\" but Goss said that he \"agreed with the decision\" nonetheless. Id. Rodriguez then allegedly said that \"heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain - be said that out of context, they would make us look terrible; it would be 'devastating' to us,\" a sentiment with which \"[a]ll in the room agreed.\"** Id\"",

            "The CIA hasn't been a part of the US government for a good while now.  Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.  This is supposed to be a fucking intelligence agency, providing information to politicians.  Instead, they manipulate politicians like some kind of psychotic James Bond villains.",

            "Damn people. Did any of you actually read the court opinion? Before you form an opinion, you should at least understand the concepts at hand.\n\n**Holding** \"CIA voluntarily has adopted and\nimplemented new protocols to avoid the improper destruction of documents in the future; and\nthat, as a result, plaintiffs already have achieved substantially complete remedial relief.\"\n\n**Legal Rule** The court may hold a party in civil contempt for failure to comply with an order if the court's order \"'is clear and unambiguous,'\" proof of the party's failure to comply '''is clear and convincing,'\" and the party \"'has not diligently attempted to comply in a reasonable manner. \", Paramedics Electromedicina Comef':ial. Ltda. v. GE Med. Sys. Info. Techs .. Inc., 369 F.3d 645, 655 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting King v. Allied Vision, Ltd., 65 F.3d 1051, 1058 (2d Cir. 1995\u00bb. Proof ofwillful noncompliance is not required. McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336\nU.S. 187, 191 (1949); Donovan v. Sovereign Sec .. Ltd., 726 F.2d 55, 59 (2d Cir. 1984).\n\n**Relevant Facts** The evidence suggests that the individuals responsible for processing and responding to plaintiffs' FOIA requests may not have been aware of the videotapes' existence before they were destroyed. Dec!. of Constance E. Rea, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Def., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 271 'U~ 12-14) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,2008). Apparently, the videotapes were retained in the field, without physically having been transferred to the OIG and without otherwise having been sent to headquarters. Id.; see also Dec!. ofAlicia L. Bannon, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 450, Exs. 41-42) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011). Nor can I say that the individuals who destroyed, or who approved the destruction, of the videotapes, were aware of court orders requiring identification or production of the videotapes. However, the lapses ofindividuals cannot excuse the failures of the Agency. The CIA, qua agency, had the obligation to identify or produce the videotapes, and the CIA cannot be excused in its dereliction because of particular individuals' lapses.\n\n**Basics of the decision** It is true that the interrogation videotapes, having been destroyed nearly six years ago, cannot now be produced. But the CIA has remedied that failure by a massive production of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 documents-records that deseribe the contents ofthe videotapes, corresponding in time to their creation, and records that relate to the videotapes' destruction, in particular, the persons and reasons behind the destruction, corresponding in time to both the videotapes' creation and destruction. Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether those records, or any of them, are exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption I or 3 or must be produced.\n\n**Summary** \"The measure ofthe court's power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements offull remedial relief.\" McComb, 336 U.S. at 193. Because plaintiffs already have achieved substantial remedial relief and would be entitled to no further relief if I were to find the CIA in civil contempt, I deny plaintiffs' motion to hold the CIA in contempt.\n\nAlso, I would like to add this case is being appealed. I am sorry, but I fail to see how this decision makes *\"US government above the law\"*\n\nMy personal opinion? I don't totally agree with the court, but I see how it came to its conclusion. Not sure whether the appellate court will uphold or reverse, but I'm leaning toward the opinion being upheld. My problem is with these incredibly annoying sensationalist titles. I mean \"Court rule US Government above law\"? Really? I didn't read anywhere in the opinion, nor was able to surmise, the federal judge making that ruling.",

Most of us are pretty happy here and we'd rather not shake things up. But maybe we can do it slowly, a gradual revolution, one without bloodshed, one in which the people in charge recognize that the system is broken and that a new system is needed.\n\nThat new system is one that I have been envisioning for years, but that nobody takes seriously, nobody thinks it can work. But a revolution needs a goal. You can't just say \"stop being greedy you greedy bastards\" and expect anything to happen. We need to change the way our country works and the way it thinks as a whole. \n\nThe system of voting for people to 'represent' you is so obviously broken beyond repair that it is disgusting. We need to represent ourselves if we ever want to be represented fairly without getting buried under political bickering.\n\nThe only way The 99% can truly be represented in government is through a massively collaborative direct democracy. This is a form of government in which the people work together to write laws, formulate policies, and make collective decisions. We would use the Internet to connect with each other and we would use a common interface to scaffold our interactions in a way that promoted productivity and efficacy.\n\nBefore you reject this as 'crazy', 'impractical', or 'impossible' ... think about it deeper, compare it to the quality of the current government, remember it is human nature to reject the unknown.

I also recall that at the time, there was a lack of clarity about whether it was okay/legal to destroy the tapes.  The tapes no doubt contained some nasty stuff, and they were probably protecting CIA/Bush/Cheney people by destroying the tapes, but I don't believe that the tapes were destroyed in defiance of the court order.

A lot of Europeans, when they first come to America, say they're surprised and overwhelmed by how big the country is. Compared to most developed countries, we're god-damned gigantic. And even when you consider the other biggies, like Russia and China, you've got most of the population still centered around a few near-by major cities. \n\nThat bigness means that picking up and protesting our government is a huge investment in time and energy. In France, where political protest is practically the favored national past-time, getting from your home to the capital building usually takes no more than a couple of hours and it costs about the same as a bus ticket from Oregon to Washington. Heck, they can go back to their jobs the next day, they might even be able to go home and sleep in their own beds each night, refreshed and ready to raise hell the following morning. \n\nI live in Portland, Oregon, and I'm paid an hourly wage. I suppose I could wait until after work, walk down to city hall, and hold up a sign expressing my outrage over the state of things, but this is Portland. At least 90% of the people who work in that building, including the politicians, already feel the same way I do. Why should I stand out in the cold and rain waving a banner at people who agree with me?\n\nAnd you want me to riot over this? I should smash up the windows of local coffee shops and thrift stores because a federal court made a shitty call? I should put on a Guy Fawkes mask and throw fire bombs at police cruisers because the CIA deleted some tapes? That's downright psychopathic. \n\nSure, if I lived on the East coast, if I were a short and cheap trip away from the White House, I might paint a sign and take my ass over there. I'd be joining the same few dozen Liberals that always show up when something we don't like happens. It's rare for the news to even mention that these groups are there any more. It's like the people who show up at abortion clinics every day; we all know they're there, we all know they'll be there tomorrow and the next day, but most of us just don't give a shit anymore.\n\nThe next time someone on Omegle asks you why you aren't rioting in the streets, ask him or her how far they live from their capital, how many riots they've attended, and what the police did to them in return.

The CIA argues that procedures already ordered by the court have resulted in a substantially full production of documents describing that which the videotapes would have shown and identifying Agency personnel involved in the videotapes' destruction; that the same court-ordered exemptions that justified the CIA's withholding of many of those documents would have justified the withholding of the videotapes, as well, if the CIA timely had identified the videotapes in response to my orders; that the CIA voluntarily has adopted and implemented new protocols to avoid the improper destruction of documents in the future; and that, as a result, plaintiffs already have achieved substantially complete remedial relief.\nI hold that plaintiffs have, indeed, achieved nearly complete remedial relief, and I deny plaintiffs' motion, except for awarding plaintiffs their attorneys' fees and costs.\n2",

That's because he is spraying an adult involved in a scuffle not seen by the camera.\n\n* 2) Note the position of the cops head and the direction he is looking -- behind the girl and towards the ground.\n\nHe is not spraying the girl -- at least not directly.\n",

Because I can see the lightness of the spray up until the mother's arm, then her arm seems clear.  I totally can believe the child got hit by mist from the spray, I'm just saying it doesn't look like he is spraying the child in particular.\n\n**EDIT**: From the source article: http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/939630-promotoria-denuncia-pms-por-jogar-spray-de-pimenta-em-criancas.shtml , this seems to be the case: (translated by Google) \"Images and photos posted between 23 and 24 March showed the press the moment when Captain Bruno Schorcht of the 12th Battalion of the PM, threw pepper spray into the eyes of a man and soldier of D'Angelo Pinel de Matos, the same battalion, reached two children aged six and seven years.\"\n\nIt seems to say he \"throwing pepper spray\" at a man, and the same spray \"reached\" two children.  To me that seems like they got affected by the mist of spray, and were not sprayed full on.\n\nAnd forced perspective results in photos like these: http://www.denzomag.com/2011/03/best-forced-perspective-photography-examples/ where people appear to be holding the Eiffel Tower, being smaller than a golf ball, smaller than a pigeon, holding 8 people in the palm of their hand, etc...

            "In grade school, we had these two ornate free standing drinking fountains on the playground, about 10 feet apart. I think it was kind of a showcase feature at the time the school was built. \n\nAt recess, a couple groups of kids would build \"volcanoes\" in the silty sand on the playground. They'd heap up the dirt, and meanwhile, a chain of kids would go to the fountains, take a mouthful of water, and then run over to the \"volcano\" and spit/dribble the water on it, while the other kids -- always just two -- built up the mountain on moistened dirt. \n\nThis would continue, and the industry of it all is an impressive memory in my mind. It was a constant line of water-spitters, racing back and forth from the volcano to the drinking fountains. \n\nAfter the thing got yay high, they'd start concentrating on the peak, forming a crater, while the two builders would start tunneling at the base, toward the center. \n\nEventually, their hands would meet, and the crater would reach the tunnel. \n\nAt that point, they would shake hands in a solemn ceremony, followed by much cheering and back slapping on the part of the water-spitters. The feeling of accomplishment was intense. \n\nAfter that, all the water-spitters got to take their turn reaching in and shaking hands with one another. \n\nThere was no class distinction between the builders and the water-spitters. Nobody was better than anyone else. The ones who were the builders were just the ones who got a good start, attracting the most water-spitters. \n\nAt the beginning of recess, maybe half a dozen volcanoes were started, and it was up to the water-spitters to choose whichever ones to add their efforts to. After a few minutes, a \"shakeout\" whittled the number of volcanoes down to two, as the builders who were unsuccessful at attracting water-spitters gave up and became water-spitters themselves. \n\nWhen the bell rang, we kicked and destroyed the volcanoes. By next recess, the dirt was dry enough to begin. \n\n",

Sure that is one form of humor, but humor comes in all forms and I would say that isn't even close to the most common.  Hell, pretty much all of stand-up comedy revolves around pointing out amusing anecdotes about the world around you, or pointing out otherwise unamusing anecdotes in amusing ways.\n\nIt sounds like you just have a much narrower view than most people in what you find funny, and that's fine.  However, humor is in the eye of the beholder and just because you don't find something funny or amusing does not mean you can declare it to be humorless.  I think the very fact that there is a 100+ comments from people who found this comic funny means you can't even claim that this is not funny, just that _you_ don't find it funny.",

No observational humor is funny if it is literal (That's when you end up with statements like: \"What's the deal with airline food, it's really awful.\" Yeah we know that's not comedy just fact). All observational comedy falls flat if you actually pick it apart and find the reasonable behavior behind the apparently absurd behavior (For example: \"Airline food is bad because because it is incredibly cheap and steamed via the heat from the plane's engines\" Now any humor that could have been there is dissipated).\n\nBut what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues.\nOr even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.\n\nI think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nTension and release.\n\n>Are you telling me you literally looked at the last panel and thought to yourself, \"I see, this comic is clearly describing a statement of fact often overlooked in the war on drugs through a parallel using dandelions.

            "Explain please.",
            "> Yeah I know, that's why I was asking what I was missing, this is obviously funny to others.\n\nWell I think at the time it was mildly funny, while also attempting to point out the absurdity in the \"just say no\" campaign (that's the political satire part).  Pointing out that overloading kids with warnings about drugs will have the opposite effect is not merely stating a non-novel statement of fact as you claim, otherwise we would have never had that stupid campaign to begin with.  Clearly to a large majority that idea is not only non-obvious, but some even rejected it.  I bet there were people that even took irrational offense to this comic.  \n\nEspecially to the reddit crowd, there is added humor in viewing this comic in hindsight.  I suspect you too are affected by viewing this message in hindsight, but for you it is lowering the humor rather than increasing it.  Looking back retrospectively at the point this comic is attempting to make about the \"just say no\" campaign, we have the benefit of hindsight that allows us to see this message as obvious.  \n\nTo you that has turned the comic from funny into merely pointing out a truth you accept so innately, you have trouble viewing it as anything but a mere statement of fact.  To the rest of us though, this adds humor by first causing us to think \"haha awesome, that guy got it from the start.\"  But then also of the depressing hilarity that even back then not only were there people who got it, but tried to warn others and yet the campaign charged on forward.\n\nComics are also not always supposed to be gut-busting funny, a large aspect of them their is character development and aesthetically pleasing artwork.  I never followed this comic, but I'm willing to bet that someone who knows this character would have the added humor in thinking \"ha! That's _just_ like so-and-so to do that!\"\n\n> No observational humor is funny if it is literal\n\nSee that is exactly what I was disagreeing with.  The stand-up comics I usually find the funniest are the ones that make me think, \"HA that's so true, that _does_ happen all the time!/they _do_ act like that in that situation!\"  A simple flat statement like \"What's the deal with airline food?  It's awful\" is indeed unfunny if flatly delivered in those words.  However, a good comedian could go on for an hour ripping on humans for wearing backpacks and have the crowd in stitches.  Especially if he ends by merely describing, exactly as it happened, a real life event from his childhood about a kid who would filled his backpack extremely full to save time while ignoring the warnings of those around him.  Only to end up falling backwards and being unable to get up as everyone busts up laughing.  A factual story told exactly as it happened and was observed, but extremely funny if delivered half-way decently.  \n\nEven if you are saying that someone merely stating commonly known facts is never funny, I still don't buy it.  I bet a good comedian could compile a list of facts that would make people laugh out loud when read one after the other in order.  I guess you could still say the comedy is in the delivery if you consider the order they are put the delivery, but then at what point does the delivery become disjointed from the content?\n\nI also don't know why you think a comedian must rip apart the reasons _why_ an absurd behavior happens, this comic certainly didn't do that.  If you are saying all observational comedy becomes unfunny to the listener if they were to pick it apart themselves, then uhhh don't do that?  I also don't buy that doing so would be inherently unfunny, sometimes the reasons why we do absurd behaviors are absurd and hilarious in themselves.  \n\n> But what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues. Or even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.  \n>  \n> I think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nWhat you describe is one _type_ of humor, and I'd agree you could boil down a lot of modern humor to fit that archetype.  However, you can't possibly think that _all_ humor falls under that archetype.  Think about any joke that has ever been told, that is based on a stereotype.  Someone telling a story their coworkers find humorous about how they nearly got hit by a little black Honda, and low and behold he looks over and it's an Asian women, is funny precisely because they had an expectation and that _exact_ expectation was filled.\n\n> Edit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n\nExactly, humor is diverse, subjective, and entirely in the eye of the beholder.  Things also almost certainly cease to become humorous at the point where you have to break the down and analyze them.",
