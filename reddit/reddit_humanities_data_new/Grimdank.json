            "The updates to the Codex Astartes following Rowboat Girlyman\u2019s resurrection allow for multiple captains in the same company in certain situations. \n\nAdditionally, the First Company is implied to have had a pretty rough time on Oghram, so it\u2019s possible the captain deployed there was killed and replaced. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Mr. Roboto Gorrillaman simply gave one of his captains terminator armor as a reward for good service. \n\nAll of this is pointless conjecture, however. The true answer is that he is Alpharius. (This is a lie.)",
            "There can be only one 1st Company captain, but other Captains may have had Terminator honours from induction into the 1st prior to becoming Captains - and so can still requisition the armour.  \nOr the Ultramarines have loads of spare suits since the 1st company are professional redshirts.  \nOne or the other.",

            "Other companies can have Terminator armor, it's just that it's highly unlikely those other companies will reach the heroic feats required to earn it.",
            "my head canon is that captains can wear whatever armor they feel like, regardless of company, i assume that all captains have the right to wear terminator armor, it would be a bit weird if they didn't.\n\nhowever there have been well more then 10 ultramarine captains depicted since the introduction of primaris marines: 10 currently available (uriel ventris, primaris capt, gravis capt, gravis capt with bolt rifle, capt with relic shield, jump capt, phobos capt, pushfit termie capt, termie capt, company heroes capt), 1 in a blind bag (space marine heroes series 4 capt), 1 no longer available (dark imperium gravis capt), and two promotional (2017 store anniversary capt, imperium magazine capt). \n\nmeaning there have been 14 captains of the ultramarines since the indomitus crusade. which it seems totally reasonable that the ultramarines would have lost 4 captains considering how many conflicts they participate in.",
            "\"Only first company can have terminator armor\" is not a rule on the codex astartes, nor anywhere else. It's just that a chapter barely have enough terminator armor to outfit their first company with them, if even that. But of course a captain of another company who wants one gets one, they are among the most honored and skilled warriors of the chapter.",
            "The 20th what?",
            " Being a \"veteran\" isn't limited to the first company, being in the first company is limited to veterans. On earning the crux terminatus you probably serve in the 1st for a while but you don't necessarily stay there forever. The chapter could decide your skills are more useful elsewhere or because it's a mark of reaching a certain standard of skill maybe you end up with over 100. This is why there's veteran sergeants and before primaris added demi companies that was where most captain candidates came from. Lieutenants probably increasingly will be veterans too, veteran sergeants are are probably where most new ones will come from. \n\nWhose dick would you have to suck to have not been awarded the Crux Terminatus for valour but be the chapter's senior leadership?",

Your arms don\u2019t have the mobility and your hands are too big to squeeze into the gap anyway. You can\u2019t even get a battle brother to help because their massive gauntlets are too big as well.",
            "imma just say that space marines players are so spoiled they get to have literally the same unit with the weapons in the opposite arms",
            "Though it is usually reserved for the first company, terminator rights are something that can be earned for use as needed, and captains are also often given the option to wear it as many are former 1st company members and generally they are the most important marines in a given conflict and may decide they need more survivability over speed. This can also apply to specialists. Also just as a fun fact, in many chapters, the 1st is so valuable that they rarely fight in a single unit and are often split up and seconded to other companies to support them, that's why you'll often see terminators, Vanguard veterans and sternguard veterans fighting along side more standard units, under \"lower\" captains.",

            "This is correct.  Most but not all company captains in a Codex compliant chapter have at one point served in the first company and earned their Crux Terminatus.  If they have, they can wear Terminator plate.  The captain of the Blood Angels Third company wears it and with some space vampire based exceptions they stick to the codex pretty closely.",

Hmm. \n\nDrukhari were actually winning a lot of games (higher WR and ratio of tournament wins than average). Maybe now though it won't be mostly because of 2 or 3 people.",

So Drukhari boats get the best of both worlds, a free pivot and a super long and thin hull that let's them get 2-3\" free movement just by turning",
            "Lore-wise I feel like it does though. Drukhari vehicles are both blindingly fast and extremely nimble. It's like their whole thing since they specialize in lightning raids in those vehicles and use them as weapons. The vehicles would have to be extremely responsive to skewer victims to take back to Commoragh. Plus the tech of a ~60 million year old civilization should be better than a 12,000 year old one.",

Hell, there is an *entire book* about a Death Guard *warband* - \"Lords of Silence\", to be more precise and that seems to be very cool - while even now Leagues of Votann (the more blatant example) has nothing.\n\nP.S.: To be fair GW is giving, *very slowly*, some love to Xenos in general. It will be released, very soon, the *Lellith Hesperax* book (a character that has **decades** already in WH40K lore). In videogames, not only the Necrons will be playable in *Mechanicus 2* but the Orkz will gain a Twisted Metal-like cart game. But it is not enough: just talking about Drukhari again, **many** of its named characters presented in their Codex from the 3rd edition doesn't have a plastic model *even today* for instance."
