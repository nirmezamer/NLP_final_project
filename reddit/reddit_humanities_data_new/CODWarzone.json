At least on WZ1 you had players who ran different combinations, such as: Grau/MP7, Kilo/MP5, EM2/OTS 9, Cooper Carabine/PPSH and more. It is not the same when EVERYONE on the lobby is running it and has such a strong Aim Assist. The Kar98k is not even a proper sniper, it is a Marksman Rifle, it has not right to be such a OP weapon. When you have a full squad running it and aim at you at the same time to down you with only 1 bullet it stop being fun. Not even as close like the WZ1 Kar98k.",
            "Well my take is that you are missing the context.\n\nKar98 was a very good weapon on WZ1 for sure. But the competition was different:\n\n- AR with way more bullet velocity \n- AR with way less visual recoil\n- sights with 3x (vlk) decreasing both visual and actual recoil\n\nThat makes an AR very competitive against the Kar98.\n\nOn top of it, the movement was miles better, with more flow, speed and no recharge of slide cancel.\n\nAll in all, kar98 had counters. Now, it is just plain better.\n\nI have played WZ1 since day one...not tripping here.",
            "It was actually a lot better in wz1 but the ARs were better to counter it",

            "Imo the problem isn't the one shot range, it's that it's so incredibly easy to use mixed with that range and damage. Stalker has similar range but it didn't take over because it's harder to use. Kar is like a sniper with training wheels. \n\nAnd sniper meta in general just kinda sucks. If you don't want to use it and trade shots from a roof all match breaking each other over and over, then you gotta deal with getting 3rd partied from someone hiding on a roof across the map constantly, it's crazy annoying and makes the gameplay much worse in general",

            ">But it's a double standard to say the crossbow is overpowered when the kar is significantly more overpowered for similar reasons\n\nBut I never said the Kar wasn't overpowered? In fact I complained about the fact that the crossbow got nerfed but the Kar98 didn't in another thread. How is that a double standard?\n\n> At that point then, it's no different than most shotguns or smgs\n\nIt is different. Shotguns in this game are (mostly) easy to use but are all either trash or mediocre at best.  Crossbow wasnt hard to use at close range (in solos/duos) and was a guaranteed down if you hit the enemy (which, again, wasnt hard to do at close range and with Aim Assist)\n\n> Not to mention the penalty for missing is your immediate death.\n\nNo? You can just run (if you are positioning yourself correctly in the first place) and/or switch weapons. That was the same argument people used last year to defend the Lockwood 300 with the double trigger attachment (that was so annoying that the devs just gave up nerfing and just removed the attachment from the game altogether)",

            "This. The AR's is what Ive been thinking but you're right about the movement too. Its easier to headshot people now",
            "I\u2019d love if they just added a helmet like in PUBG that would prevent the one shot down. And tweak the availability and purchase price for it as needed so that sniping isn\u2019t too op.",

I argue it is easier to use the kar, and I imagine many others would also.\n\nIt doesn't really matter how easy or hard the crossbow is anyway, because its effectiveness is in close range where a ton of other guns are better. The same same can't be said for the kar within its effective range.",

            "the chance of hitting even the foot though is extremely unlikely. I used the xbow, I enjoyed it due to the extremely high skill level it took, but making it not a 1 hit down makes it impossibly bad and useless.",

            "I'd say nerf the range or something. Or slow down its fire rate. I'm a seasoned KaTT user and Resurgence has become far too saturated with KAR snipers.",
            "No. It\u2019s clearly evident that the general community doesn\u2019t know what they want. \u201cWe want rebirth, we want the kar back, bring back 1 shot sniping, we want wz1 movement back, we want this, we want that\u201d. Then complains when it finally gets here. \u201cThe kar is too OP, rebirth is too sweaty, you can\u2019t move without being sniped, people move to fast like they\u2019re on crack, blah blah blah\u201d. It\u2019s an endless cycle of people complaining for the sake of complaining",
            "In WZ1 the assault rifles had 1200+ bullet velocity, (mostly) only 1 damage drop off so killed much faster at long range, much less sway and random recoil deviations, and so little visual recoil that a 3x optic was the meta for full autos for the entire life cycle of the game.\n\nWe have none of those things now. There is no effective counter sniper to use to balance out the Kar being OP.\n\nThat is the real problem. The other long range options are bad.",

Si the kar is easy to use because of the maksman aim assist, good, how about we fucking nerf the aim assist instead of the fucking weapon? While we are at it, maibe fucking buff the snipers as well, so they won't get overshadowes by a marksman rifle, lmao",

            "TTK? lmao. You hit them once with an arrow and run so they dont shoot back at you, simple, really.",
            "That's cuz the KATT is not a rebirth sniper. There's different snipers for rebirth. \n\nThe Katt is really a BR sniper and slow playstyle gun. Really it needs better BV to even be good for its slow movement/ads and its aim sway drawbacks. The Kar and XRK are far superior for rebirth so it's not a matter of over saturation as much as they are just plain better for what the design of the map/mode is.",
            "The optics actually helped your recoil which is the biggest reason why they were better.\n\nI much prefer the 3x scope meta vs the AR's iron sight meta we have now. Iron sights are lame unless they are the grau",
            "Finally someone talking some sense!",
            "Sure, but what you're talking about is orders of magnitude more difficult to implement and will never happen.",
            "You really want to use the devs decision to nerf/buff something as an indicator for something?",
            "Yes these devs know exactly what they're doing, great point.",
            "Based on your experience it's not a rebirth sniper.\n\nI've usually had great success with it.",
            "Well, Treyarch removed a overpowered weapon from ranked and Raven nerfed it, so I guess two different dev teams do know what they're doing.",
            "You'd have better success with either of the 2 others I mentioned that's the point. Use what you want it only hurts you... but its not a reason to say the KAR being oversaturated in the mode is a problem.\n\nThat said I'd love them to make more light snipers useful by placing short 1 shot range caps and movement speed variations/ads variations/aim stability variations on them like they have with xrk and kar. This would give people reasons to actually use some of the other 10+ snipers/marksman rifles. As well as the opposite for the slower bigger bolt action snipers... they NEED a straight up 1 shot range cap... delete explosive rounds or make them NOT 1 shot but have splash damage... cuz you know that's what explosive rounds insinuates. It was so dumb for it to sewer BV just to get a 1 shot."
