It is also a great opportunity to explore new music and find gems! If you didn't receive any at first you can try again after 3 days.\n\nPlease link to **specific tracks** for feedback - not artist pages or full albums.\n\n**You can** [**visit our discord**](https://discord.gg/27wgKfafmP) **at any point to post your track for feedback in our Feedback channel.**",

Also, not sure what genre to tag this as so any help there appreciated \\^\\^\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/silphidae/pathfinder](https://soundcloud.com/silphidae/pathfinder)",

            "Made this ambient track a while ago. Might not be your typical style, but I'm welcoming any feedback.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MipJSGwbQok?feature=shared",
            "That phaser effect on the vocals (or the entire track, can't tell if it's effecting everything or not) is kind of overwhelming for me personally, but if that's the style you were going for I think it's great :) I think you could clean some elements of the track in general up in the mixing process, but for the most part everything sounds great man!",
            "A cool mix of Electro house and DnB (i guess?), sounds pretty good! If you want to improve something the mix is quite muddy and everything else sounds wide, more separation for clarity would be nice \ud83d\udc4c",
            "I don't know if it's just because I'm high, but this is one of the sickest tracks I've heard so far from this subredit. \n\nI would say that there are a TON of complextro elements in your tracks, do you have any tips or advice for someone just beginning to learn complextro type tracks? Any finger in the right direction, maybe to a well-rounded tutorial or something, would be much appreciated! :)",
            "thanks! I'm glad you enjoyed it \\^\\^\n\nas for the complextro elements, honestly, I didn't have a specific technique in mind when making it. I just added different synths and sounds wherever it felt like something was missing. Just experimenting and layering different elements\n\nI haven't watched any tutorials on complextro, but this one from Infowler seems really detailed and well rounded: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBIatSkDpMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBIatSkDpMM)"

            "Ah, this reminds me of my early days. peaked out at around 11,000%. Don't ask me how it makes sense, i just knew at the time that it was going to be straight heat.... what i actually made was lukewarm at best. \n\n  \nEither way, This kind of behavior is Based off of multiple factors: \n\n1. The software or plugins being used. You stated that you're using nothing but stock, so that rules out that problem. (However Harmor, Patcher and vocodex can be absolute monsters depending on how they're used, so be careful) \n\n2. Hardware specifications. depending on the type of computer, even the simplest of plug-ins can cause this issue. What you want is a computer that has at least 8 GB RAM as well as SSD storage and something above an i3 Intel processor or something equivalent, be it Ryzen or otherwise. Also, it should be fairly modern. an i5 from 2010 may not be as powerful as an i3 from 2020, etc. \n\n3. Internet connection. While it may sound a bit strange, sometimes an Internet connection that is slow can end up affecting the entire system, including FL studio. \n\n  \nTo remedy this issue, I would recommend the technical approach of trying to isolate the issue. First off, you said this issue started around FL21, So you can definitely go ahead and see if downgrading to FL20 has the same issue. You can also try using those same plugins on a different computer if one's available, or the easiest, in my opinion, using FL studio without an Internet connection. The latter of which helped me immensely before I got a new computer.",
