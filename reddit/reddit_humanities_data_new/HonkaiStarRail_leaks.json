Their dynamic is so much fun. I love that Kafka lets Firefly have free reign with her credit card, I love that Silver Wolf is poking fun at Firefly (why do you ask a question if we all know you've made up your mind and are stubborn as hell), I love that Blade is worried in his own angy grandpa way, I love that the crew regularly throw sweets at him and Kafka.

The voice acting was so raw. His VA really went above and beyond. I'm desperate to know how his and Robin's story plays out in the future. I *need* to know what price Jade is going to make them pay - Shaoji has me worried with her previous \"customers\" losing their wealth, their relationships, and their memories. I don't think it's going to be something as simple as just getting information from Robin for the Oti deal. That seems too small a price to pay compared to Jade's other bargains.!<\n\n>!The Rant (ye be warned, there are negative feelings I'm going to vent out and then move on from ahead)!<\n\n>!The rest of it just was not my cup of tea. At this point, I hope Hoyo stops trying to write \"clever\" characters since they always, always, always miss the mark. The entire scene behind Jade and Oti was just *bad*. You hype up a character as poison and an extreme business shark and then turn around and give her a scene that essentially boils down to:!<\n\n>!Oti: Everyone here is so smart! We're so smart! Let's be transparent because we are so smart we all know what's going to happen! Here is my entire plan!!<\n\n>!(10 minutes later) Jade: Here is my detailed plan a 12 year old could make. We're going to talk bad about you on social media and news networks. Or you could do this deal instead.!<\n\n>!Oti: Wow! You are so smart! This is a great deal!!<\n\n>!Idk man I'm just tired of Hoyo not being able to decide if they are a visual novel or an rpg. There is so much they could have done with a character that excels at working behind the scenes instead of just telling us she is smart. Jade just deserved to have her writing handled with care, instead of what felt like her being shoehorned in at the last minute to do a small lore drop :/!<\n\n>!Moving along, Sparkle's arc in penacony was a miss, the bomb scene sure happened, the only thing impression of the end cutscene I had was \"Why is Aventurine standing next to Acheron's slash that we spent 3 hours fixing in the boring Clockie Event?\" Just left me feeling indifferent to everything, which isn't something I want from an epilogue.!<\n\n>!Last gripe, but it's been ongoing pet peeve with both Genshin & HSR: I really, really, really wish Hoyo would put more care into animations during the character interactions. Most of the time the characters just stand there and do 2 or 3 arm gestures and the Floaty Breathing With Their Arms At Their Sides Thing and that's it. Hope they spend a little more time/effort on them moving forward.!<",

It took a bit of timing to get right since Boothill's standoff meant Cocolia was just blasting him a million times in a row, but with a little bit of planning I was able to make sure Luocha's auto-heal was always ready to save Boothill in the middle of Cocolia's blasts!!

            "So I completed DU max difficulty and I felt like sharing my thoughts. Yapping warning.\n\nThings I have liked so far:\n\n- Great variety of builds\n- New and refined approaches to path identities (destruction being the biggest winner here)\n- Rebalancing of some absurd blessings which made previous SUs too easy \n- Reaching high blessings count is now harder to accomplish and you have to be more cautious with your picks.\n- Even my strongest builds would not steamroll bosses. Depending where you come from this may be a negative but I liked the fact I still had to be strategic no matter my build.\n- Biggest positive by far imo: auto building the characters. I could play Firefly day 1 and it is an excellent feature.\n\nThings I disliked:\n\n- A lot of builds felt weak/very hard to get going. I specifically felt that break builds were heavily favored *BUT* it is possible I was just not building the other ones correctly. Some of you may have had more success with non break builds than I did.\n- Lack of reroll makes RNG more frustrating. If you do not get the blessings you are looking for in the start there is an argument to be made that starting over is the way to go. (Yes, you can reroll with fragments before bosses but the cost increases rapidly/workbench)\n- The first 5* equation being given from the first boss instead of the start. I get that a 4* is easier to complete by the time you reach the first boss but the 5* equations are the make or break deal. Lack of rerolls also aggravate this issue.\n- RNG will screw you over way more.

            "Hello. Here's a list of how I think the Aeons would be like if they worked in a coffee shop or similar business (this comment is inspired by the other comment about whether the character would be admitted into a lab; for reference I think all the Aeons would definitely be rejected except for Ena)\u00a0\n\n\nNanook - wouldn't even get hired in the first place. Silent, deadly, would definitely kill someone over the counter. Destroying the workplace is also frowned upon and definitely something they'd do. All in all, a terrible employee, they'd just destroy everything\u00a0\n\n\nNous - would be awful at customer service. Theoretically would have the knowledge to make the world's most delectable cup of coffee, but their lack of hands stops him from actually doing so. Their overbearing thousand thoughts a minute talking style would also overwhelm the customer and the cashier left unregistered. However, if there's anyone who can do the financial math and expenses and taxes, it would be Nous. Their lack of supervision of the Genius Society also implies they'd be a mostly absent manager\u00a0\n\n\nAkivili - has probably done community service in the past, if we judge the Trailblazer's and current AE crew's past experiences. Theoretically the best Aeon to work anywhere. Would be a great employee, if only because they actually work and are capable of talking to people.\u00a0\n\n\nAha - the novelty of an Aeon being a barista may stop them from causing chaos in the workplace, at least initially. Decent employee if they don't get people's orders wrong on purpose or mess everything up but we know that's not happening. Can shape shift, so has hands and can talk to customers\n\n\nXipe - Probably one of the best employees. Would definitely not cause trouble, and would simply do their job. Has hands. Can talk with people. Understands the importance of teamwork. All in all, a great employee\n\n\nEna - Micromanaging manager.\n\n\nTazzyzzyronth - who hired them? For similar reasons to Nanook, they'd be fired, but also because he's propagating in the coffee too\n\n\nYaoshi - would likely do their job, but may also grant customers immortality on a whim and violate some sort of food standard protocols\n\n\nLan - Would have to be forcibly removed from the premises for trying to kill a fellow employee\n\n\nQlipoth - most likely the most genuinely hardworking employee ever. Does their job without complaint. Has hands so can definitely make things. If they can build a wall for thousands of years, they can make coffee nonstop. However would most likely try to return to their wall\n\n\nOuroboros - no.\n\n\nHooH - would try to change the orders so everything is perfectly in balance. Double the productivity for double the Aeon (and its two selves)\u00a0\n\n\nFuli - would just stand there and record memories. Nonperforming employee.\n\n\nIdrila - ??? Employee missing\u00a0",

            "Penacony story review as a HI3 player, no spoilers, blocked out some of it because it\u2019s so long haha, yapped too much\n\nTLDR; It\u2019s good, but could be better. 7.5/10\n\nThis is the first major story arc written by Shaoji, and as his writing style is very distinct, you can feel his influence and voice throughout. This is a compliment in a sense, as the other stories (Belobog, Luofu), are more \u201cgeneric\u201d and standard for video-game storytelling. However, this isn\u2019t his best work, and the story overall feels heavily self-indulgent at times. Compared to the heights of Elysium Everlasting, Penacony has great set-up, but stumbles at times and doesn\u2019t quite stick the landing when it comes to pay-off. So many plot points that are built up to be huge get handwaved, multiple characters are underutilized and unexplored, and some characters need to stfu and get to the point (you, Black Swan).\n\n>!When I thought about why Firefly and Robin don\u2019t work as characters for me, it\u2019s because I realized that they don\u2019t really have personalities besides \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cwant to do good\u201d. They don\u2019t really have any kind of meaningful character development. This is less of an issue for Robin, who\u2019s really a side character (that\u2019s a different problem), but for Firefly, as one of the main characters we partner up with for the planet (a la Seele/Bronya), it doesn\u2019t really work for me because the events of the story don\u2019t leave a tangible impact on her. She wants to keep on living, but she wanted that before Penacony. Nothing could change and she\u2019d still be the same. Her backstory also isn\u2019t explored in game the same way as Aventurine\u2019s, so I can\u2019t tell you much about what led up to this. It\u2019s explained in the trailers sure, but I shouldn\u2019t need to do homework to like a character. Why does she even like the TB? Did they know each other during TB\u2019s time with the Hunters? Idk, they never tell you. I also wanted to see Firefly act more like edgy SAM while outside of the suit (let women commit mass murder), why is no one treating her like the dangerous (badass) Stellaron Hunter she is? I\u2019m upset because I like what she had potential to be, and they kinda wasted it. Ironically, I think Acheron\u2019s story was handled ok with the drip feeding of her story and motivations, but if you aren\u2019t a HI3 fan I feel it\u2019s likely you\u2019d get kinda lost at times with the fan service.!<\n\n>!The 2 new main male characters, Aventurine and Sunday, are handled pretty well in comparison. Shaoji has a pretty good track record with male characters, and throughout the story, we are able to thoroughly understand their backgrounds and motivations, and by the end of their story arcs, reach a solid conclusion driven directly by the story\u2019s events, while also leaving room for future developments (Sunday\u2026). This is the treatment Firefly deserved in-game, but likely didn\u2019t get due to how lengthy the story is already. That brings me to the pacing.!<\n\nWhat Shaoji really needs is a strong editor who\u2019s willing to put their foot down and say, hey, maybe this is too long. The gameplay team need to integrate the story better. Everything could be so much more concise and there are entire sections that could have been emails. Do I really need to walk through 3!! maps for Sunday to finish his preaching? Do I really need to sit through a philosophy lesson for Acheron to answer my questions? Do I REALLY NEED to listen to Black Swan wax poetry about the universe for her to tell me what fucking happened? A few times is fine. But please. I don\u2019t need everything to be so flowery and verbose, it reduces the impact of the sections that use it well. And I play in CN, so no, it\u2019s not just the translation, Shaoji just loves to write like that. One of the things that Sumeru does so well in Genshin is that it doesn\u2019t really waste that much time- overall, most of the plot points/gameplay build towards the story\u2019s ending. So much time is wasted in Penacony. So much time that could be spent on developing the side characters is spent running around the map doing puzzles to reach the next sentence in the essay. Still don\u2019t get me wrong- this is the best story quest we\u2019ve gotten so far. It *is* really good, and I will continue to praise it. It just could be better.",

We had Blade the Uber driver scene in 2.2, seeing Silver Wolf want to \"stir up excitement\" with Firefly in Penacony, Silver Wolf remarking on Firefly's habits, Kafka lending out her credit card, picking out fashion for Kafka, Blade being a worrywart, Firefly talking about purchasing a second oak cake roll to give to Silver Wolf, Kafka, or Blade. It's all everyday mundane things you would see in a family with a little crime on the side as a treat,,,!<\n\n>!But not once did they mention *Elio* in these kinds of activities (no offerings of oak cake roll for the cat, the ultimate crime :<). The only time he is brought up in this interaction is when they are talking about following his script.

She was a genuine delight for me in the game (even if the story parts of her event dragged a bit for me) and I adore her VA and design so much. She just seems like someone I'd love to hang out with. I love that energy. !<\n\n>!And then we have the eccentric as hell Dr. Ratio that responds with \"k\" to a bomb threat, and is later mentioned to be assisting as the \"plaster head guy\" according to (I think) Boothill. He just said \"fine we'll entertain the gremlin, but here's my serious face.\"!<",
            "I graphed all the global stats from Star Rail Station and came to some interesting conclusions.\n\n* The three most pulled on banners were Acheron, Seele, and Ruan Mei. The three least pulled were Ratio, Boothill, and Argenti. Robin trails closely behind Argenti, making her by far the least pulled support. :(\n\n* Although Boothill's banner stats look extremely low, they're likely underreported. I noticed that SRS's stats on recent banners keep going up a decent amount after the banners end, probably because people update their stats infrequently. However, it's still likely the lowest pulled banner not counting Ratio's. (They actually kept going up while I was writing this, which made me very confused when I went to double check my work. This also probably means the data is significantly biased toward earlier banners in general.)\n\n* Because of this bias, it's hard to know how well Firefly's banner's doing. Judging by trends of how previous banner stats updated over time, she doesn't seem to have surpassed Acheron - but we need people to upload their stats to be sure.\n\n* Star Rail Station also lists the amount of unique users who pulled, so you can see if people vertically invested in a banner. Acheron pullers spent a whopping 113 pulls on average, far and away the most for any character. For reference, the average is 54 pulls. Aside from Seele, the release character, people also invested heavily in Black Swan and Kafka at 68 pulls. Ratio pullers only spent 19 pulls on average, which surprised me as I thought anyone willing to pull on that awful banner would be a mega simp gunning for E6, considering we already got E0 for free.\n\n* User distribution is much flatter, meaning a lot of people pull at least a little bit on many different banners. Even Acheron isn't much higher here than the competition. The most universally pulled character is Ruan Mei, beating out even Acheron and Jingliu.\n\n* Rerun banners are much less lucrative, often only getting around 1/5 the pulls that the new character does. The three most pulled on reruns were Silver Wolf, Imbibitor Lunae, and Kafka. It's too early to say how Ruan Mei's rerun will fare, but it's shaping up to be very good.\n\n* You know how HSR's 50/50 seems to be biased in our favor? The data suggest that the 5-star rate is also better than it should be. The consolidated chance of a 5-star including pity should be 1.6%, but many of the banners reach as high as 1.7% or 1.8%, and none dip below 1.6%. The rates average out to 1.68%, which comes out to an average of 3 pulls saved per 5-star. Could this be a self-reporting bias? Maybe, but paimon.moe doesn't look like it has the same bias, so this is likely HSR-specific (or possibly an issue with SRS's data somehow).\n\n[Here's the sheet if you want to see!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRiVQeEFhvTXz82mgbdjQpw98q9STKOagSbFhaJ2Jk2s4hsXjWF5XuNKWiMIeMQlL7KaSGufOYxbO_6/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)",

            "Okay, I think I cleared everything in 2.3 in regards to story & side content. Some thoughts (beware this'll be a long one & I might to do a separate comment for the new gameplay stuff):\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPenacony Epilogue: >!The epilogue was a neat palette cleanser from the previous heavier story driven parts with some good comedic moments (seeing TB's antics from a third party's PoV, Ratio dropping a \"k\" & leaving the groupchat was hilarious & the whole \"bomb\" segment with Sparkle lol!<\n\n>!The PoV segments of Firefly & Jade were okay (I dare say a tad bit too short for my taste just like with Robin), since it left me wanting for more. I did enjoy seeing Jade's MO in regards to negotiations (shout out to her JP VA for shifting her tone slightly, when she starts to negotiate with Oti alone, to show she means business & it was very noticeable, before Oti pointed out the obvious) & I loved Firefly casually chatting with Silver Wolf and getting more glimpses into the relationship between the SH.!<\n\n>!I'm not sure why they decided to this, but the transition from the firework scene with TB & Firefly to the AE going to Dreamflux Reflux to say goodbye to Acheron & Micah and paying their respects to Mikhail, Tiernan, Razalina & Gallagher, was extremely jarring. It feels like something was missing in between those two scenes. Nevertheless, this must have been my personal story highlight in this patch having all members of the Express in one spot & honouring their predecessors with March's unexpected philosophical question.!< \n\n>!Speaking of Acheron: I'm going to miss her. She and Robin were the characters who unexpectedly grew a lot on me during the Penacony arc and I hope we get to see her rather sooner than later, since the optional talk with her, did imply we'll meet her again.!< \n\n>!It's almost a given that we're going to return Penacony in a continuance quest at one point, considering the Nameless are share holders of Penacony with 5% & are on the board of directors.!<\n\n>!Amphoreus, a planet where not even Akivili set foot, sounds really exciting. It's obvious Black Swan suggested this next to stop, not because out of kindness of her heart, but because she hopes to collect some very unique memories from here. The wait will be a long one...!<\n\nIf I had to spontaneously rank my favourite story parts it would be: **1.** 2.1, **2.** 2.2., **3.** 2.3 & **4.** 2.0. Overall, I'd give the Penacony arc an eight out of ten points. Keep on cooking Shaoji.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSide content & other stuff:\n\nDreamscape Pass: >!I didn't expect the narrator in the pass to be Razalina! I was so sure it was Elio, but in hindsight it makes sense considering in one of the pages if you select the option, the narrator remarks how TB is similar to Tiernan & they would've gotten along well with each other. The only people who knew Tiernan were Mikhail & Razalina and Acheron when she met him as a Sin Thirster. Guess at the end we've gotten to know her a little bit as well!<\n\nSidequest 1: >!\"Checking Out\" has to be my second favourite side quest in Penacony, since it feels like another small epilogue for the other characters. Topaz & Aventurine bickering like siblings, Jade radiating proud mom energy around the two, Argenti & Boothill becoming friends (I think I was able to hear faint happy screaming across the globe from the Guns N' Roses shippers lol), Robin going on a  journey outside of the spotlight & Qingque nearly getting forced to join a cult had me rolling. What also got a chuckle of me how the devs themselves were lampshading when will the AE crew will get another new member, lol.!<\n\nSidequest 2: >!Remember, how people here wished how nice it would be to have a room on the Express to decorate?. Welp, TB now has a whole ship just for themselves on Penacony, lol. I went with the Pom Pom design for the engine, but you can change it at anytime, you just need to talk to your First Mate. Also in regards to decoration, Screwy continues to be the best genius, since we can also use the paintings from occurences & SU story as decoration for the ship, you just need to progress DU a bit until you unlock the museum.!<\n\nThree other titbits, won't spoil them if you haven't discovered those since they're pretty neat, but I'll still put it behind spoilers:\n\n1. >!After you completed the story, return to the Parlor car. Right opposite of the table where the guest book is, you'll find a readable!<\n\n2. >!Remember the dude on the rooftop in Dreamflux Reef who said he is preparing something Hanu related in 2.2? Go visit him make sure you have two Golden Aideen Tokens in your inventory!<\n\n3. >!After you finished picking your First Mate for your ship, you'll get a package.

            "2.3 spoilers, speculation on future arcs\n\n>!one thing I really liked (and also makes me a little nervous for the future) is march\u2019s worries about the future. It\u2019s something that ties in pretty neatly with the story of the Nameless in Penacony, of how all things to do come to an end and exist only in the past, but also of how their stories will keep enduring.!<\n\n>!The part that makes me nervous is wondering how each of them will react to a farewell. Himeko, judging from her character stories, is almost always ready for any farewells. She\u2019s kind of fascinating actually, I do think that her best time in the spotlight will be at the very end of the journey given her suspicious connections to Akivili. Welt is a little hard to judge but I think he\u2019d be sad but take the farewell with grace. He\u2019s enjoying the adventure and cares for the Crew but his ultimate goal will be to return home at some point, wouldn\u2019t it? If he\u2019s able to go back home, I think he\u2019d have some regrets but would gladly go back. Though there is the point about him wanting to protect Himeko\u2026.. I guess, he would willingly leave when Himeko leaves. I\u2019m less sure on him tbh. Now the trio are the ones I\u2019m most nervous about!<\n\n>!March, for instance, really doesn\u2019t have any huge ties beyond the Express Crew. When the time comes for farewell, where will she go? Maybe she does get some idea once she gains her memories back, but what happens if she never gets them back? Or what if the people who existed at that time aren\u2019t alive any more? The Crew are everything for her and the people who she\u2019s made the most memories with. I think for that reason, the idea of farewells would be especially devastating for her!<\n\n>!Dan Heng\u2026.. interesting case wherein he could technically disembark on the Luofu. Despite the public dislike, there are still people there who respect him and treat him well, like Jing Yuan and Bailu, and Yanqing. He does long for his homeland and it could be a chance to slowly regain his connection with it, in a better way than how he was treated in the past. But ultimately, his most precious and closest ties are to the Crew. Plus his most deepest desire was to travel forever with the Crew\u2026. He\u2019s aware that it\u2019s a fantasy so he knows there\u2019ll be a farewell. But I think it\u2019d be pretty devastating for him all the same given how much he wishes to stay with them!<\u00a0\n\n>!And what happens with Trailblazer? As a character that\u2019s like half self insert, half their own character, it\u2019s pretty hard to pin down. They could easily be a case like Himeko or someone like the other two in the trio. But I\u2019m leaning towards being like the other two. In their case tbh, im more nervous about how *they* would eventually leave the Crew. As a body made to house a Stellaron, how long will they live for? How exactly is their journey going to end? Like is it going to end with a sacrifice on their part, is it going to end with them being the first to leave\u2026.!<\u00a0",

Anyway, moving on, the very last page of the Dreamscape pass sticker book has everyone's stickers in it with some nice text underneath it that relates somewhat marginally for the character, and Ratio's one is \"I just did what a supporting character would do\", which is so at odds with everyone else's, which were generally reflective and introspective of sorts, or even Boothill's funny \"this is some nice fudge! I mean the actual candy\" one. So why is Dr. Ratio, poster child of an academic scholar, talking about being a supporting character (a line usually mentioned by people like Sampo and Sparkle, who are Masked Fools)?!<\n\n\n>!My speculation is that either this ties Ratio more deeply with Amphoreus, as the Cosmodyssey Board Encounter was written by Sparkle and emphasised Amphoreus' theater culture, and also made a Ratio reference (so perhaps Amphoreus citizens view life as some kind of performance, and this is just relating Ratio further to Amphoreus) OR it's more evidence that Ratio is in some way connected to Elation. It's also worth mentioning that thus far, Ratio has acted out different roles in both Mundane Troubles (his Trailblaze Continuance) and the Penacony plot, which are his 2 plot relevant sections. In 1.6, he pretends he has no idea about the whole thing and just goes through the interrogation, investigation, fight the entire way through and acts clueless, even going so far as to take a theatrical bow when he lights himself rather dramatically on fire and leaves, and in 2.1, when he acts like he hates Aventurine and even betrays him very convincingly. Both times he has just been acting, which is another theater connection to Amphoreus and a possible theater connection to the Elation too, especially with his owl mask on his shoulder, which seems a bit similar in concept to Sparkle having a fox mask. Am I saying Ratio is a Masked Fool? Probably not. But I am saying that Ratio probably has ties with Elation concepts, and if the Amphoreus-Ratio connection is real, then Amphoreus probably has Elation concepts in it too.!<\u00a0\n\n\n>!A last bit I was thinking about, but the whole theater, Elation, Erudition connection makes sense if the cultural inspiration is Ancient Greece/Rome for Amphoreus. There was a period of history where the Greeks, right after overthrowing a tyrant and establishing a democracy, used Greek tragedy plays as a means of political education to ensure that citizens would remember that tyranny is bad and to remember to be an active, conscious voter involved in politics to ensure that governance would not fall into the wrong hands. In this regard, Erudition also tied in nicely for Amphoreus, esp with the Dr. Primitive mention. And who else do we know with Greek inspirations in their character that has acted out a part for the sake of educating people again? Dr Veritas Ratio, of course.!<\u00a0",

            "I agree with pretty much all of this. I wrote about my disappointment with 2.2 [here](https://www.tumblr.com/willfulabyss/753673306757087232/major-22-main-story-spoilers-ahead), and 2.3 just continued this trend. It really, really feels like 2.0-2.1 and 2.2-2.3 were written by entirely different writers and that the latter group took a hard turn to try to soften the story.\n\n[2.3 main story] >!My biggest issue is with the pivot from murder mystery horror Disney with trappings of anti-capitalist/materialist satire to generic, flavorless video game fantasy. Throughout 2.0 and 2.1, I was engrossed in the lore of Penacony, doing all the side quests and feverishly hunting for all the readables, trying to piece together this place\u2019s history.\u00a0(And there were so many eerie moments, like the weird Clockie with the Bizarre Tape that depicts an actual scene of carnage or that one-time interactable in the Dreamscape hotel that shows a chilling flashback of a prisoner getting shot dead by a warden for drinking SoulGlad.) But after 2.2, I just\u2026 lost interest because there\u2019s apparently not much scary about Penacony after all. There was so much *atmosphere* and buildup in the first two patches, yet it inevitably went to waste because the vibe changed entirely once we learned that Misha was actually *totally* fine, no trauma here\u2014in spite of the horror of A Child\u2019s Dream and that freaky first encounter with SUD. I already talked about my disappointment with Misha\u2019s story in my previous post, so I won\u2019t go into that again. But it bears repeating: If you\u2019re not going to give a horror/mystery payoff, *don\u2019t do a horror/mystery setup!* A good part of my disappointment stems from that tonal bait-and-switch.!<\n\n>!Conceptually, I like the *idea* of learning about the previous Nameless, but while Tiernan\u2019s piece was woven really well into the narrative, Razalina *barely* existed, and Mikhail\u2019s was tied up in the whole Misha disappointment. And 2.2-2.3 quests spent *way* too much time waxing poetic about these former Nameless when only one of their stories was actually compelling (and only really the \u201cafterlife\u201d portion of it). That time, as well as all the filler fluff with the SoulGlad competition, would have been better spent developing the other characters and tying up loose ends (of which there are still many). The timeline of Penacony is still a confusing, nonsensical mess with people who should have been long dead during certain eras still existing despite not being indicated as long-life species. (I haven\u2019t done any of the side quests from 2.2 yet aside from Dreamjoy Memoir and the Dr. Blues quest, but I\u2019ve seen it said that apparently, you can just\u2026 give up your physical body and exist forever in the dream world? If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s 1) playing way too fast and loose with the narrative, AKA too convenient for the writers for my preference, and 2) never mentioned at any time in the main story or major side quests despite greatly affecting understanding of the main story. Also, why is Mikhail\u2019s corpse just\u2026 in there if it\u2019s a dream? And will it remain there forever\u2026??)!<\n\n>!Aside from Robin and Firefly (who I largely agree with you on), Gallagher was another whole mess of a character. We get that insane cutscene at the end of 2.1, and it amounts to basically *nothing*. As for his character, I still don\u2019t understand what exactly he *is*. His last character story implies he has an original self and that sense of self largely resonates with Gallagher. Yet it also seems to be implied that he was a fictional character created by the History Fictionologists (another element that, while conceptually interesting, feels like the writers playing too fast and loose with the narrative\u2014if anything can be justified as \u201cthis faction just made it up,\u201d it allows for easy retconning and hand-waving). If that\u2019s the case, why was Gallagher created? How did he get to know Mikhail and why? Also, he apparently died in 2.2, but I didn\u2019t even notice. What was up with that? Anyway, I didn\u2019t need him to be the main villain (or even really a villain at all), but I wish that antagonism he showed toward Sunday at the end of 2.1 amounted to\u2026 anything at all? Inevitably, he feels like a \u201cconvenience character,\u201d just there to guide us to our next plot point and info dump a bit. And that sucks because he has a great design. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever explained anywhere why he starts to Hulk out in his idle animation before keeping it at bay with whatever\u2019s in his flask. I had been speculating that he was actually Hanunue due to his intense hatred of the Family and loyalty to the Watchmaker and also that he was a Borisin, hence the dog/wolf aesthetic that both he and Hanu share. I mean, it would have made so much sense! The weird transformation he was suppressing, the fact that he\u2019s an Abundance unit, and him being alive from the Prison Era (because Borisins are long-life species blessed by the Abundance)\u2014it all fits. But no, he just ended up as another underutilized character with a great design and indistinct origins.!<\n\n>!Overall, I\u2019d give Penacony 5/10 (though my current disappointment wants me to rate it lower). It\u2019s hard-carried by 2.0 and 2.1 and *especially* by Aventurine, who was the real standout and the only character who made actual good use of the POV switch. If this is how Shaoji writes male characters compared to female characters, perhaps he should hand the ladies off to a female writer? I feel like sometimes, men who write female characters are satisfied with them just being \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ccute\u201d and fail to develop them much beyond that (obligatory \u201cnot all male writers\u201d). I got similar vibes from Firefly as I did with a certain creator\u2019s pet from the game 999, and that\u2019s that the author liked the character too much as a romantic interest and not enough as a character. Rather than showing us why we should like them, they instead give them lots of informed attributes and forced-shippy moments with the self-insert. (Firefly was a much milder example of this, but she did have shades of it.) From the special program, I really got the sense that Shaoji is a serious writer and that he has a lot of passion for his craft, and as a writer as well, I really respect that. But I think you\u2019re right; somebody needs to take the reins from him occasionally and tell him \u201cno.\u201d I think he\u2019s a talented writer, and I look forward to seeing more from him, but I also think he needs an editor\u2019s firm hand to guide him away from some of his own self-indulgence. It\u2019s also good to know that this isn\u2019t his peak and that he\u2019s capable of more.!<",

Also bring good toughness breaker/support. Example: DHIL, Gallagher, RM is comfy enough for argenti side",
            "You can. My friend without FF can barely clear it with his terrible relic, no 5* eidolon things. 1st node acheron team, 2nd super break JY as I remember.\u00a0",
            "You definitely can \n\nFollow up teams have a good time on that cycle \n\nMono quantum has an okay time\n\nBreak centric characters like Boothill and Sushang have a good time on it \n\nYou can also make a makeshift break team with Harmony trailblazer doing all the heavy lifting as well. I 3 star\u2019d that side with an e0 Guin and trailblazer, also attempted it with Himeko and TB and 3 star\u2019d it. \n\nHypercarry Jingliu also has a fine time on it",
            "First half Acheron + Second half Boothill did it for me. Saw a friend who does Acheron DoT first half + Jingliu hypercarry 2nd half and also clear.",

            "my friend did it with his sushang and ruan mei team. But i agree FF is very strong, I slapped a 4star LC on her, quantum relic, lvl 7 talents and at 130% break, harmony mc(no lvled traces), ruan mei and loucha. I managed to 3 star it, but not my premium FUA team \ud83d\udc80",

            "Pretty sure firefly also got the favoritism and they aren't even trying to hide it. Loads of hype by hoyo themselves, relics and planetary sets tailor made for her on release, they are too blatant about it. I like firefly but i hate how hoyo butchered boothill when they reworked the relics to not work for him without HMC.",
            "Oddly specific considering that bosses typically have more than 1 weakness type. If the said scenario occurs where minions don't have any of those weaknesses, they're bound to get destroyed by a DPS that can cover for it which in turn means that the Boss will have that same weakness typing.",

Two, the answer to your question is Firefly. Or boothill. Or Acheron. Or even Xueyi.",
            "I don't think there is a way to fix this because they'll always have to give us a reason to pull for new characters. It's inevitable that they will have to nerf Acheron and Ruan Mei through enemies and buffs that don't support them. It sucks but that's just how turn based gachas work.",
            "We'll just get even more support characters with niche gimmicks to counter niche enemy gimmicks. For instance if Gepard provides a toughness hide shield on an enemy, then we'll just get a character who can tally the amount of damage dealt to destroy that shield, then re-unleash them in one god once the shield is destroyed.",
            "I cleared with 6612 so glad I didn't have to do it again.",
            "Yeah RM is part of the break meta and lucky I had her and my FUA team was useless on side two against Argentina because it's a Topaz and Ratio. Hitting the right elements but you just can't beat Argenti without strong Blast like JL, DHIL. I barely cleared it with Clara Topaz RM and Luocha.",

            "I mean yeah that is a break team so it doesn't get nerfed by the mech.",
            "Yes Firefly is also an example. I can let the relic set a pass since Firefly does shit damage even blast compared to BH, in the absence of HMC on the team. On the planar however, they could have made it locked to fire break.",
            "She's getting her bis lol (jq ) hoyo buffing her even more ..",
            "I personally think that firefly is the most questionable designed kit they released after dehya. Sure she is strong but it felt like her kit was a last minute change. Biggest gripe for me is the HP drain feels out of place.",
