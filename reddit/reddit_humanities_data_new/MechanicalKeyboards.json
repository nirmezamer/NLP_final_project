            "Hey !\n\n**TLDR :**\n\nMe want either \ud83e\udd8d :\n\n* okay inexpensive temporary classic keyboard to do some g@m1nG *and typing* until august\n* a somehow future proof keyboard i could mod in august\n* an interesting g@m1nG experience keyboard (like wooting) that would justify to buy it now AND build a custom in august.\n\n**Specifities** For the typing part, at least 65%. My ideal format would be 75%, maximum 80%. I'm okay with 60% if i go for a gaming keyboard + general purpose one.\n\nI'm from France, also i'm French (which might explain my clunky english, sorry D:) so ISO format is a plus but i'm absolutely fine with ANSI. (my dead ducky was an ansi, and I was fine with it)\n\n**Details and LOOOOOORE -**\n\nSo, I was planning on building my first custom in August as it would be a fun moment to share with my gf when she's coming back from japan, and she'd bring back the remaining parts of the build she wanted to make from there.\n\nBUT, my ducky one 2 sf just died (i spilled water, I had to finish writing my thesis so I quickly tried to dry it and replug it in a hurry, and i think it was too soon to replug this poor guy o7 rip buddy :( )\n\nSo, i'm kinda stuck. I could just build my custom earlier, but I really want to share this moment with my beloved pouet, yet holidays are here and g@m1nG is calling me, decent typing experience too so I need a keyboard to wait till she comes back (sorry if this hurts you my poor old 15 bucks membrane thingy)\n\nMy first thought was to get a wooting 80HE, since I always wanted to experiment this rapid trigger feature. This is the kind of thing I'd definitely feel and love on competitive fast fps. This way, i could play with it during the summer, and when Mrs is back, I can make it my custom, by modding it to a somehow decent typing experience too. (I saw some much better analog switches out there, could change the case, lub ofc, etc.)\n\nProblem is it's actually preorder, I wouldn't get it before august, so it kinda becomes pointless, I could just wait to build a whole custom as planned.\n\nSo now I'm hesistant, I could eventually get the 60he just for g@m1nG without spending more money to mod it (as 60% is too small for me to enjoy typing with it, especially programing), and then build a custom in august, but that's a lot of money. I could also try to get a budget pre built that is somehow decent, I saw many prebuilts below 100$ that actually sound great !\n\nSo I'm hungry for your recommendations :D",

But the software has to support it, or rather the firmware of the board as it has to send different signals to the computer if it wants to act as a gamepad. As far as I know, so far only the wooting has this capability. But you can still mod it if you want to go for it or change the default switches for other hall effect switches. If this is a use case I can really recommend the Wooting, it's actually a great keyboard if you are interested in it's features."

            "> People paid in advance, and the keyboard market is booming?\n\nThe boom was the 1-2 years after covid. It's died down a lot since then and the past year has been particularly hard (partly why so many businesses are shutting down or being shut down). \n\nCost of living is going up and discretionary spending is going down. You will hear this from basically any vendor, even the ones doing well. They would have been doing much better during the covid boom if they were around.\n\nAside from mismanagement, the main issue is **cashflow** which can affect any business. If you have too much cash, you aren't utilising it to generate more cash. If you don't have enough, then when invoices come, you can't pay them.\n\nI can't comment on how mykb got to this point, i'm not in the EU and haven't followed them closely. But running many GBs require space and staff. Both will cost you money regardless of how long it takes a GB to deliver.\n\nThat means you are burning cash waiting around. One solution is to run multiple GBs so you always have stock coming in. This is not a problem if managed properly and many big stores operate this way. The other solution is to have regular products (in stock) to generate cashflow like a 'regular' store.\n\nSo the key is in managing cashflow. A quick google says that 4 in 10 businesses are killed by cashflow issues. Nearly half of all businesses. There are of course a hundred reasons leading up to that, like M&C using all their profit to buy out unpopular sets and way too many extras.. \n\nWhich ultimately causes a cashflow issue meaning they cannot pay an invoice.

Storage space costs money, every item that sits on the shelf costs you money over time so you have to calculate how many units you are going to sell.

Very strange.\n\n[February 20th, 2024.](https://imgur.com/a/XqbE4XV) Still no refund, message them asking about it. They claim refund is sent when it isnt.

This would add to why the messages are on February 20th so confusing, and why there was such a discrepancy in communication time between February and March. Regardless, I read through everything and can see why it all got so confusing, please avoid Discord as any support channel. So, yes I acknowledge the mistakes above and apologise for that, however I am really confused to the whole happenings as even PayPal was bouncing money back and forth and at a point the claim ended and money came back to us, it seems to situation is not as easy as shown above.

It should be somewhere on your website - even better linked to the articles themselves. And it should just automatically send emails when there is updates on the products GB status. I don\u2019t want to check the motion board every couple of days just because the ETA is due for weeks and there is no update yet.\n\nSpeaking of ETAs. Next is the fact that customer support provides ETAs that are not met at all. And I\u2019m not talking days or weeks but months. If you\u2019re unsure if stuff will arrive, don\u2019t make false promises. Just say \u201ehey the supplier is having issues, please be patient, you will be updated when there are any news on your item\u201c. \n\nJust being left alone with false promises and having to look for updates yourself regularly is a really really really bad experience. I know you are not responsible for delays. But for the customer experience while waiting. Which can take months.\n\nEdit: stupid as I was I have ordered on candykeys because it looked very legit and high quality. Man your website looks great. But while waiting and waiting and waiting I looked up reviews and let me tell you. They are not good. I assume you are aware of this. If I had been smarter I would\u2019ve read the reviews first and decided to just order from an international supplier. Lessons learned.",

So yes it was processed on Sunday...\n\nImportant to add to anyone reading - This is a GB being cancelled from 1.5 Years ago - The refund the customer wanted earlier this year was done within 24 hours (since we are discussing Refund Morale and the customer did not state this)\n\nAlso mate - Reddit is not the solution, if you have questions then you should start replying to e-mails and the official ticket. I am still confused how writing anything on reddit will assist the ticket speed in any way. I will refrain from answering your ill-intended comments and posts on everything you can get your hands on as its clear the posts and comments are not intended to get your refund but to just bash and cause damage for no reason.

This is perhaps a little naive on my part, but I find that the absence of communication is the most anxiety-inducing thing in this niche hobby with small-scale production.

As of 5 minutes ago, the order was just refunded because I opened a case on the PayPal website over the weekend. \n\nAs for the emails, it\u2019s pretty much me asking if they are refunding it and the two emails I got back were \n\nApril 25\u201cHey, not yet, we are still cancelling it sdaly :/ The process has started yes.\u201d\n\nMay 14 \u201chey (me), sorry, should be done anytime soon, give us a bit.\u201d\n\nThe refund was requested on April 16.

This is me just saying we needed more time, but this is a matter of a custom keyboard we need to still cancel with the manufacturer with respect. With respect it takes time to do these types of cancellations, its not instant and now we have your board arriving and paid at the manufacturer, all vendors do not even provide refunds... Under a specific law put in place for customer specific products that avoids a standard refund procedure, so being called out on reddit saying we \"ignore\" your refund request is not ideal.",

I wont be supplying bank refund data on reddit comments will I?\n\nI ask myself, what are you trying to achieve with these comments? This post you made is dead in the water and you even got refunds unrelated at all to the posts.... just respond to your e-mails and all communication paths instead of ghosting us and treating us like shit on reddit.",
