To say Snape is in the wrong is like saying that a guy who was jumped by a gang is in the wrong for pulling a knife.\n\nAs for the Whomping Willow Incident, it is very possible that James was acting more out of concern for Sirius and Lupin, and what would happen to them if Snape died. So not really that altruistic.",

The most defining achievements we know about James Potter is that he was an arrogant bully willing to choke someone with soap (which is literally torture), sexually assaulting people for the fun, blackmailing his crush by promising to not bully anymore her best friend if she become his girlfriend and then still bullying her ex best friend behind her back. \n\nThen he joined the OoP and died some years later by trying to save his family, something that every remotely human person would do.\n\nSnape from his side saved countless times the lives of people who loathed him for over a decade, he literally played a major part in saving the wizard world and actively tried to make up for his mistakes. \n\nBut yeah I guess James Potter is the better person by far somehow.\n\n> People are also forgetting snape tried to kill James when his back was turned. James has his worst moments but Snape also was in extreme wrong.\n\nOh no, how dare he... *checks my notes* tried to defend himself after James and his pals attacked him just for fun. Truly a shame.

Perhaps to spare Sirius, Remus and even eventually himself a conviction for attempted murder ? Something actually backed up by the fact that James and the Marauders continued to bully Snape even after this event but just saying.",
            "You know James was just 20 when he died right? We are basing his whole character on his interactions with one person which we can clearly tell are biased on Snape\u2019s point of view. Yes, Snape redeemed himself but it took Lily\u2019s death for that to happen, Jamws redeemed himself a long time before, fighting in the Order of the Phoenix against the guy Snape supported. He tried to fight the most powerful Dark wizard ever just to buy his wife and son some time to escape. \n\nOn a side note, I find it weird how people will glorify Draco as this unlucky kid who was forced into everything, but vilify James based off his interaction with the guy who hated him above all others. Malloy went out of his way to make Harry\u2019s life miserable, was the Wizarding equivalent of a racist and was clearly favoured by Snape because of his father\u2019s money. While I do feel sorry for him when it came to events after book 5, he was not fully redeemed, the same as Snape. They are still morally grey characters at best.",

So I had the older version of them in my head even while reading.... so I'm living proof of your point. Thanks! This is why I love reddit. It absolutely makes their death more tragic. \n\nHave you ever seen fantastic beasts? I only mention bc they found different actors for their youths in one of the movies and quite literally nailed it. I've never seen better matches in any movies I've watched. I even thought Jude Law as Dumbledore was perfect, he matched up better with Richard Harris I think. But when I read that's the Dumbledore I see.",
            "True.\n\nStill for the above point, it wouldn't matter to Snape. \"THIS guy bullied ME and stole MY love, get dunked on loser\".\n\nMakes us recognise Snape wasn't an innocent victim, but for him I doubt he feels like he should forgive James just because he himself turned into a bully.",

            "They bullied eachother and Snape was 10x more violent than James",
            "Literally never confirmed anywhere that Snape had a role in this bullying, and even less at the same degree of violence than James",
            "And where was it said that he did it?",
            "You\u2019re conveniently forgetting about the fact that snape tried to kill James with sectumsempra when James\u2019 back was turned. You should read books not fanfiction.",
            ">His school bully and abuser\n\nActually it is more of a rivalry case, since Lupin admitted that Snape never lost an opportunity to hex James.\n\n>Lol ? The most defining achievements we know about James Potter is that he was an arrogant bully willing to choke someone with soap (which is literally torture), sexually assaulting people for the fun, blackmailing his crush by promising to not bully anymore her best friend if she become his girlfriend and then still bullying her ex best friend behind her back. \n\nWhat bullshit. James matured when he grew up and fought for the Order and protected Harry from Voldemort. He even saved snape even when snape was so fucking stupid to enter the whomping willow. Despite snape being a vile and disgusting person. He only hated snape, and he has good reasons for hating snape. James expressed his dislike for Slytherin, saying he would rather leave. Snape however insulted James and his father as dumb muscle. Snape was a potential death eater from the start and was obsessed with creating illegal and harmful spells. He also stalked Lupin wanting him expelled. Why would James have to like him? And snape would have been truly helped if he had not lashed out and called Lily a mudblood. Lily constantly asked James to leave snape alone, and James actually stopped but snape chose to escalate the fight again.\n\n>Snape from his side saved countless times the lives of people who loathed him for over a decade, he literally played a major part in saving the wizard world and actively tried to make up for his mistakes. \n\nNo, he didn\u2019t save countless times. He only saved Harry a few times. That\u2019s it. He joined an organization meant to kill muggleborns like Lily herself. He was a reason why Harry had no parents. At least in the end he redeemed himself that\u2019s why Harry somehow showed respect for him in the end. But it makes no sense since Snape tormented Harry for years and Harry went too far to name his kid after snape. Snape is very near to evil. He is still considered grey, but a very disgusting and vile person. \n\n>James and the Marauders continued to bully snape even after this event but just saying.\n\nNo, they stopped bothering snape. Snape and the marauders movie is fanfiction, not canon at all. \n\nI wonder if actually you read the books or not.",
            "It's kind of wild how people will focus on James being an arrogant bully as a kid, as if that's less normal and more outrageous than a kid trying to join a cult which worships a tyrant who has pushed the boundaries of dark forms of magic to new heights.",
            "Not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I want to point out a few things.\n\n1. It\u2019s heavily implied that James wasn\u2019t actually remorseful about his bullying and abuse, just that he became more discreet about it.\n\n2. Several characters, not just in HP, but in all of fiction, redeem themselves after their actions affect themselves or their loved ones.",
            "> You know James was just 20 when he died right? We are basing his whole character on his interactions with one person which we can clearly tell are biased on Snape\u2019s point of view.\n\nHis words against James are indeed biaised, not the memory of his \"worst day\".\n\n> Jamws redeemed himself a long time before, fighting in the Order of the Phoenix against the guy Snape supported. \n\nHe didn't redeem himself with that lmao :\n\nFirstly joining the Order of Phoenix didn't make up in any way for what James did to Snape or the other students he harrassed. If I bullied, tortured and assaulted someone for years just for fun, I don't see how joining the Marines will somehow redeem me. \n\nSecondly he never even apologized to him for the bullying, torture and sa.\n\nAnd thirdly we also know for a fact that James continued to bully Snape during their whole time at Hogwarts, even after dating Lily. He never changed. \n\n> He tried to fight the most powerful Dark wizard ever just to buy his wife and son some time to escape.\n\nUh yeah but that's like basic human decency to not just let your family die, I don't see where's the redeeming in that either. Even terrible people like Lucius or Vernon would have been willing to do the same if Voldemort intended to kill their son.",
            "James was terrible even when was not a bully. He has that haughty, arrogant attitude that's uncalled for since he was clearly not special. He was not a naturally talented wizard. Couldn't fly without brooms and didn't invent spells unlike Severus. Clearly inferior but had an intolerable attitude. Just an unlikeable character all around. Sirius Black is atleast somewhat likeable because he has this whole arc about understanding greyish areas in morality.",

            "No, it wasn\u2019t. It was stated that Snape was a hypocrite because he hung out with people who did worse, not that Snape himself did worse to other students.",

            "That last bit of info apply to you.When did he use Sectumsempra?Why didn't James die in a pool of blood if he used it.",
            "I feel like this might be similar to Umbridge vs Voldemort kind of thing. Most people have probably encountered a school bully in their lives, but they didn't encounter people joining tyrants.",
            "Yes, they just focus on James being a prick, while ignoring that snape hanged around with death eater wannabes and joined a terrorist organization which resulted in Lily\u2019s death. Confronting them with evidence is just as pointless.",
            "So we just excuse attempted murder as they are kids...?Right.That's definitely less worse than joining a cult.",
            "It depends on how a person appears externally. Severus has a deeply interesting personality because of that quiet smugness and pure talent because he could fly without brooms and invented spells. James is like one of those high school kids who doesn't have the traditional genius traits but has an overly loud and dominant personality. You can tell that people like that are not special. They don't have great talent deep down. They just know to cheese through things. That's why James never invented any spells.",
            "James and Snape was a mutual thing.  Both \nattacked each other.  You only ever saw Snape\u2019s side, and a small selection.",
            "James Potter was described as being an exceptionally talented wizard by quite a few people. He was stated as being the top of his class alongside Sirius, a class might I add that included Snape. Both James and Sirius completely aced all of their OWLs with ease and not much studying, from what we saw in the flashback. James, alongside his friends, became Animagi at age 15, something that has been described as being incredibly difficult and dangerous to do. They also created the Marauders map, a very intricate piece of magic. James and Sirius invented a magical telephone during school. James also fought Voldemort three times and survived three times before that fateful day on Halloween. \n\nYou can hate on James all you want but calling him an untalented wizard is just objectively false. And it\u2019s completely unfair to compare a 21 year old James to a 36 year old Snape who was taught by Voldemort himself. If you compare their accomplishments at age 21, James far exceeds Snape.",
            "Stop reading fanfics",
            "He tried to buy some time. He wasn\u2019t thinking straight, he just made a split second decision to try and stop him, he had no why if knowing if Voldemort would reach Lily and Harry before he could grab his wand and come back. Was it futile? Sure, it\u2019s not like he would win anyway. But it was brave, it showed selflessness, he was ready to throw away his own life without a second thought.",
            "No, not that far, but it is implied he had some wizarding racism in him. When Lily asked if her being muggleborn made a difference, he hesitated before answering. It's pretty clear that the hesitation was him realizing that he had a bias against muggleborns but choosing to keep that under wraps.",
            "He was racist, yes.",
            "Snape was also bullying other students, but the difference between him and James was that while James used mostly harmless spells like the jelly legs curse or levicorpus, Snape, along with his friends, was using actual Dark magic that caused actual harm to students. \n\nJames never sent anyone to his death.",
            "What Lily said that Avery and Mulciber did it and she can't believe how someone like Snape could be friends wi5h them",
            "That\u2019s an interpretation, not a fact. I think you can practice dark magic withouth billying people.",
            "Yeah, Snape was an adult bullying children",
            "He used Sectumsempra when James had his back turned to Lily when she pestered James to leave snape alone. The spell hit James\u2019 cheek thus causing it to bleed brutally but he didn\u2019t die.",
            "Snape joined a murder cult with the intended purpose of killing people he hated and thought were lesser based on their heritage \n\nYes that's worse",
            "Attempted murder? James knocked Snape around and physically bullied him, but to call magically pantsing a guy \"attempted murder\" is a stretch.",
            "Never invented spells? The marauders map?\n\nAlso James didnt write all over his books, so we dont know what he invented",
            "James and Sirius were considered the most talented students in their year.  Not sure what you are talking about.",
            "Talking to James haters is just a waste of time. I am a James fan, but even I don\u2019t ignore his worst moments and I also don\u2019t hate snape and like him as a character. James haters just lack reading skills. Ignore them.",
            "Just because someone achieved mainstream success doesn't mean they're smart. It just means they work hard and have high productivity. It's not a sole indicator of talent. James had an extremely supporting home and lived in an environment where qualities for success were nurtured. He didn't have raw talent at all. Raw talent =/= material success.",
            "I would like to add James had actually fought and escaped Voldemort twice before this. Dude was 20/21 facing down the greatest threat of his time unarmed, he had guts. Obviously in a true 1v1 there was no scenario James could have won or even really delayed Voldemort, both previous times it\u2019s implied he escaped quickly, this fight was only going to end one way.",
            "It is implied that he already had a bias against muggles because of how they react to magic (see his father and Petunia) and I don't blame him. If at 11 you see that pattern is easy to associate bigotry with muggles",
            ">James used mostly harmless spells like the jelly legs curse or levicorpus\n\nOr spell that cause you head to swell up twice the use amount of size perhaps?Or threatning to remove pants?\n\n>\u00a0Snape, along with his friends, was using actual Dark magic that caused actual harm to students\n\nIf you remember No one ever mentioned Snape particpating in them",
            "Snape was never implied to have used spells on others, just hung out with people who did. Also, it was stated multiple times that James spells and actions weren\u2019t really that harmless.",
            "But they practiced dark magic on an individual, and Lily precisely stated that what they did wasn\u2019t funny, and no different than how the Marauders treat him.",
            "Snape was a vulnerable child who was groomed into joining a cult by the only people (bar one) who were nice to him. \n\nNotably, in the Pensieve trial in OotP, a Death Eater tried to gain clemency by accusing a bunch of other people of various crimes - and Snape's only accusation was membership rather than wholesale torture and slaughter. Moldy obviously just liked having a competent potioneer around.",
            "I think they are referring to when they lured Snape to the Shrieking shack in full moon (although that was Sirius idea)",
            "No I am referring to the Werewolf prank and a only a few weeks later James decided it would be a good Idea to carry n SWM. Best part it to was cheer up SIRIUS",
            "That's not a spell. They just created a magical tool and all 4 of them created that together. He didn't write all over his books because he could only follow the traditional path of learning. Otherwise there would be a record somewhere.",
            "Did you not read my comment? He is literally stated to be an exceptionally talented wizard. He aced all of his OWLs with very little effort. He invented new ways to use magic. He\u2019s fought Voldemort and survived. Coming from money doesn\u2019t really help with any of that. Especially since James\u2019s family wealth wouldn\u2019t do jackshit at Hogwarts. They\u2019re all on equal footing at school. \n\nJames is a very talented wizard, probably even more than Snape. In the flashback, we see that Snape is studying furiously for the OWLs, while James and Sirius are both very relaxed and aren\u2019t studying. Meaning James and Sirius are more naturally gifted and needed to give less effort to get better results.",
            "If he managed to dodge the first curse (technically possible), he could have punched him and physically taken his wand. \n\nIt's not very likely, but there was a slim chance he could win.",
            "\n>Or spell that cause you head to swell up twice the use amount of size perhaps?Or threatning to remove pants?\n\nNeither of those are Dark magic. In a world where you can just make all the bones in your arm disappear and then grow them back without much issue, making someone\u2019s head swell up for a bit is not that bad. But yes, threatening to pants someone is indeed a very bad thing to do. But that\u2019s still just public embarrassment. Not actual physical damage using dark magic.\n\n>If you remember No one ever mentioned Snape particpating in them\n\nBecause we barely get to see Snape\u2019s childhood and he sure as fuck wasn\u2019t about to show Harry a memory of him beating the shit out of some kid. But, we do see Snape defend the use of evil dark magic for bullying by saying it was \u201cjust a laugh\u201d to Lily.",
            "Technically, Snape uses a sectumsempra on James before the accident where James levitates him etc. Not to justify anything James did, which was pretty humiliating, but he wasn\u2019t some defenceless kid throwing expelliarmus around. He meant harm.",
            "James had nothing to do with the werewolf prank. In fact, he\u2019s the one who saved Snape\u2019s life.",
            "You just make shit up to fit your fanfiction.",
            "Lol that's why they didn't know how to fly without a broom. Or occlumency. I think you're having a misunderstanding of what natural talent means. The only two wizards having the natural ability similar to Snape were Dumbledore and Voldemort.",
            "So, as long it's not dark magic, is it ok?Do you think Lily would befriend a bully?In fact, she wondered how someone like him could be friends with Avery and Mulciber.",
            "If we don\u2019t see, nor is there any indication or implication that Snape himself used dark magic on others, then the statement, or even the assumption that he did, is just an unfounded invention.",
            "Sectumsempra?Where the heck was that?James lived a Sectumsempra?",
            "Yes and weeks later he enacted the SWM for the entertainmaint of SIRIUS.Sows how little impact it had on him.Had it not been Remus James would have let him die that day.",
            "These things are not a skill issue for James. They are a, \"Nobody does these or teaches these\" issue.\n\nVoldemort and Snape are the only two people who fly unaided in the books. It's suggested in Book 7 that Snape learned the trick directly from Voldemort, himself, who likely invented it. So, it's not like anybody else even knows how or can teach it. Even Dumbledore can't fly on his own, as far as we know. So, yeah, whytf would James or ANYBODY be able to do that? Makes no sense. They don't know how. That's not the same as not being able to.\n\nAnd Occlumency is also not something people are usually taught. Snape almost certainly learned it on an as-needed basis--probably after becoming a double agent for Dumbledore. Before that, he'd have no reason to. Even freakin Draco Malfoy was an Occlumens canonically (taught by Bellatrix). And I guarantee he's much less talented than James, no matter what level you place James on.",
            ">Lol that's why they didn't know how to fly without a broom.\n\nSnape probably learned flight from Voldemort. Besides, Snape didn\u2019t know how to fly without a broom at age 21 either.\n\n>Or occlumency.\n\nWe have absolutely no idea if James learned Occlumency or not. \n\n>I think you're having a misunderstanding of what natural talent means.\n\nI completely understand what natural talent means. You\u2019re just ignoring every piece of evidence that shows without a shadow of a doubt that James was an incredibly talented wizard for no reason other than the fact that you dislike his character and want to glaze Snape. \n\n>The only two wizards having the natural ability similar to Snape were Dumbledore and Voldemort.\n\nYou honestly think Snape was on par with Voldemort and Dumbledore? Bro he was getting pushed back by McGonagall in a one vs one. Snape wasnt even at the top of his class, while Voldemort and Dumbledore were both doing things that had never been seen before during their school years. He is nowhere near the level of Voldemort or Dumbledore.",
            "He defended the use of dark magic to Lily.",
            "Sorry could you not use acronyms because I have no idea what SWM means.",
            "Talent is mostly revealed in novelty. It's precisely the things that can't be taught easily that make you talented. Its speculated that Voldemort taught Severus how to fly without a broom but that makes little sense. No other death eater knew that. It's likely that Severus learnt it on his own just like he figured out novel methods to make potions and tricks to make them faster and better. James never did such things. This is exactly what talent really means. It can't be replicated. You can't teach someone to be Einstein or Euler. There's no method to become one.  You either have the novelty or you don't. There were many James Potters throughout the history of Hogwarts. There was hardly anyone like Snape. Severus was a league above all the marauders.",
            "That person is so funny, because Snape was a Potions prodigy and could cut people with a spell he\u2019s some sort of unparalleled genius now. It\u2019s unfortunate what fanfics have done for people\u2019s perception of characters, an inspirational and heroic character like James Potter is somehow being treated as worse than a former blood purist because he loved someone else\u2019s girl who never reciprocated. It\u2019s pathetic really. I don\u2019t even dislike Snape, and Alan Rickman (RIP) will always be a legend for the way he made so many of us like the character, but the way these people ignore his every fault and glaze him is hilarious.",
            "> Snape probably learned flight from Voldemort\n\nMoldymort doesn't share spells. The flight thing he copied from Lily, when she kept her momentum up when jumping off a swing.\n\n> pushed back by McGonagall in a one vs one\n\nTo be fair, he was only defending himself here, and doing pretty well until two more teachers started in on him.",
