            "PKJ and Montos have made the UP Lanterns and their ability to use the different Spectrums a lot more intimidating in just two pages than Jeremy Adams' has in his GL run in my opinion. But good effort Shepherd. \n\nI feel kind of a dark mirror situation going on between John and Olgrun where they're both builders in a way only Olgrun's creations and legacy became dark and corrupted. None moreso than his \"daughter\" and her memory. And now John has to face that shadow.  \n\nSo Star Shroud is officially a John Stewart rogue at this point. \n\nSteel does something cool! Even if he gets beat up afterwards. Better than Natasha who just got beat up. \n\nGuy for the save! I wonder how this jives with his adventures in House of Brainiac.",
            "Goddamn it, this book is so fucking great!\n\nNice to see Olgrun's backstory being more and more fleshed out. I really hope PKJ has plans to carry on this story because I feel there's a lot that can be done with his character. Technically >! John's not even fighting Olgrun but just a fragment of him!< so there's a good chance we could see the real one later.\n\n\nAlso Shepherd and Gardner official team up! That should be great.",

            "I don't care about what happens with Olgrun and whatever but that 'Shroud' has to be destroyed the worst possible way by the end. It cannot be allowed to survive after what he has done. No mercy for that thing.\n\nSo Guy escaped Brainiac and showed up just in time to get Shepherd so they can go help John. Lucky that they are probably avoiding Absolute Power.",

The Doom-mite seem to be looking quite similar to Mojo from Marvel honestly from the design to attitude.\n\nAgain, with the Sixth dimension, I thought World Forger would be there. Maybe this Doom-mite decided to run away? Bullying lower dimensions?\n\nI guess this does try to explain why we don't see Batmite around anymore where Batman just went 'Don't have time for silliness in my books anymore after this'. Which is quite sad honestly. And then of course just as he is about to reveal his master plan to defeat the big bad, the big bad actually does the smart thing to shut him up by turning him into a doll. Oops.",
            "The great things about this comic are Jimmy having Mxy\u2019s powers (and Mxy being a powerless civilian, which is interesting) and traveling to the Fifth Dimension to recruit the Justice Imps to save the world with help from Dick, Kara, and the JLA; and Clark, Bruce, and Bat-Mite traveling through dimensions (i.e. Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, and First) before returning to the Third Dimension, with Bruce telling Bat-Mite that Bat-Mite missed all the Silver Age adventures he had with Bruce and that he wants to do a final team-up with Bat-Mite. Also, Clark and Bruce seeing their future selves.\n\nMark Waid has done an excellent job on expanding Mxy and Bat-Mite based on their experiences encountering the World\u2019s Finest.

            "This might sound a little Ben Reilly of me, but I wouldn't have minded if Bruce Jr's aging was to have been stopped, and he simply disappeared into the sunset as a \"Thomas Kane\" or something, basically a version Bruce that could live their own life without the Trauma, the Oath and the Mission.\n\nBut eh...",
            "This is fucking ridiculous and I am enjoying it lmao.",
            "Just in time for the big relaunch in October, Zdarsky gets to work on putting those toys back in the box. If you haven't been a fan of Batman's status quo for the past few years, you'll be happy to know that this is the start of its reversal. Bruce gets his billions back, he moves back into *a* mansion, he and Selina are back on good terms, and his hand gets restored thanks to a little help from his clone.\n\nSpeaking of, I'm kind of neutral on how that whole thing was resolved. I certainly didn't need another addition to the bat-family roster; and I definitely wouldn't like Bruce adopting yet another kid, especially considering how cold he is to them most of the time (not to mention he's been dodging Cass' child support cheques since '08). But I don't know... I feel we lost some sort of story that could have been told here. But I guess if he was just left to his own devices, he'd return in about a decade or so as a villain alongside Snyder's Alfred clone, and then we'd have some real messy Clone Saga crap on our hands. So, yeah, maybe in the end this sort of resolution was for the best.\n\nGoodbye Totally-Not-Terry, we hardly knew ye!\n\nOther than that this issue is - like I said at the top - really just groundwork for not only the linewide DC relaunch coming later in the year, but the entire Bat-Family group of books that are getting relaunched as well. I thought I'd be sad seeing all the Bat-Kids corralled back to the manor, leaving their own spaces like The Hill and the Marina, but those spaces and the characters in them weren't being that well utilised in the first place, so I'm willing to give this new concept a try. If it means the Bat-Family get some more character focus in the main Batman book (not likely) or some sort of team book out of the living-under-the-same-roof premise (more likely) then what the hell, might as well.\n\nAs for the future of Zdarsky's run? Well, going off future solicitations and the page-end stinger at the end of Gotham War, it seems Zdarsky's final arc will revolve around Batman's identity, the crook who knows it, and tying up loose ends with Savage, Capito, and the Joker. Will Bruce get his identity revealed at the end of this run? It's funny that I would even ask, right?\n\nI've been very sporadically reading this book since I dropped out with the Multiverse arc, but I wanted to see how all the Zur and Bat-Family stuff would resolve. Now that I've got my answers? I'm pretty confident in leaving this book to run its course until it gets a new writer. I doubt we'll ever get the lows we got with something like Gotham War again, but I also doubt we'll hit the highs of some of the stuff Zdarsky had in his opening Failsafe arc. So while the run goes on, I think that this here is where I step off. It's certainly been *something* Zdarsky, that's for sure. You write one hell of a Tim Drake, though. \n\nNow THAT is a book I'd like to see announced for October.",
            "I liked the slower issue. A little sad the clone died, poor guy never stood a chance to live.\n\nDidn\u2019t like the Damian bit at all though. He considered his clones like brothers, and now he doesn\u2019t consider Robin Zur even a person?\n\nI get it was probably to set up the Failsafe plot thread for AP, but man, why the regression?",
            "I like that Bruce tried to do whatever it takes to save his clone from being aged up before the he cloned sacrificed his hand so that Bruce could have his hand back before he died in piece. I also like that Bruce got his money, house (although it\u2019s a new manor since he told Savage to keep Wayne Manor because he\u2019s going to find a way to defeat him because new status quo), family, and Selina (who told him about her adventures in Tini Howard\u2019s run, in which they laugh because it\u2019s ridiculous and dumb) back. Overall, this is a good comic and sets a new status quo for the Batman Family after Absolute Power (which might be a lackluster event).",
            "So, this is Zdarsky's run... Definitely was not my thing, I know he's going to be writing for a while longer however the main part of the story is concluded, and it's been underwhelming. \n\nCan't really redeem what's already written considering that Zdarsky has already done worse with retconning Bruce and Joker's characters. This is the big finale, there's nothing more to look forward to in this run. It ends with a whimper, Zur was the big bad all along, it somehow became sentient and the story devolved into the same old \"kill criminals or not\" debate, except with even more character assassination this time. Such a waste.",
            "Maybe not the biggest fan of this arc (and the several preceding it) but Bruce watching himself age and then finally pass away was really poignant to me. \n\nYou just know he never once thought of that as a possible way for himself to go out, and seeing it literally happen definitely hit him hard.",
            "The way that this resolves all of the plotlines that have been running for the past few years honestly just feels like an anticlimax. I'm certainly no fan of that status quo, but just being like \"oh yeah there's some money hidden somewhere and here's a hand I guess\" is kind of lame.",
            "I thought that this was a lovely issue! I really enjoyed it, specifically: (1) >!The clone being a brutal reminder of Bruce's mortality and making him question how he wants to live his life!<. Basically, raising the question of - on your deathbed, do you wish you spent more time being Batman or being with your kids? (2) >!The paradox of Batman becoming a better Batman by rejecting the self-reliant solutions, like having a robot hand or living in Wayne Manor!<. (3) >!BatCat!!< Sue me, I like them, I was happy to see them reconcile at the end.\u00a0\n\nQuestions: (1) Did the artist change in the issue? I feel like the earlier pages were drawn differently than the second half. (2) Does anyone know what's up with >!Jason!<? The panel with everyone standing is ridiculous enough, it's like almost a football team at this point, but I'm curious if people happen to know where he is.",
            "Not a fan of Damian disregarding the clone Bruce like that. It feels like character regression given all of his development in Tomasi and Williamson's books.\n\nBruce gets his money and his hand back, OK. Would've preferred if he'd gotten back the main mansion as well as building new stuff but whatever.\n\nWhy didn't Bruce just defeat Vandal Savage for good instead of just punching him a few times and calling it a day, Dark Knight Strikes Again style?",
            "This whole run was the equivalent of barfing your guts out after getting food poisoning from an all-you-can eat buffet on a cruise ship.",
            "I think this was the best issue of Zdarsky\u2019s run and I\u2019m happy we\u2019re about to turn over a new leaf with this run. I think we\u2019ve had some really good arcs like Mindbomb and Failsafe. Despite us getting stinkers like Gotham War I think this has been my favorite run since Batman relaunched at #1 in 2016",
            "This issue was good its a nice slower issue that worked and bruce has his money back. \n\nChip continues to write a terrible damian however as damian normally treats clones like brothers and his reaction to the zurr clone especially with his recent developments under williamson it just felt not like him.",
            "Well I was concerned this clone would just be forgotten about, but I guess a quick death at least gives him an ending.\n\nIt feels weird because I honestly stopped thinking about Bruce not having his fortune. Didn't seem to effect him at all. But oh well, guess he's building something with the Bat Family at least.\n\nAlso Bruce, seriously? You just defeated Zur/Failsafe and you're not even gonna bother make sure you dismantle it? Whatever Failsafe does in Absolute Power is on Batman.",
            "I had honestly forgotten about Bruce still missing a hand but I guess if we were going to get a mini Bruce Wayne clone the books don't really need, at least he can help fix that. \n\nThe whole \"Bruce Wayne is now a millionaire instead of a billionaire\" thing was always dumb because writers were so inconsistent about it and it never really seemed to make that much of a story difference aside from when they would occasionally reference him not being as rich any more (But still rich mind you), so Bruce getting his finances back is probably for the best. All he's missing is his family company and we're good.\n\nI guess in current circumstances we can't just wholesale move back to Wayne Manor so why not get a new one, name it after Alfred, and call it a day? At least until we do get back to Wayne Manor. \n\nSo are they trying to set up the WFA status quo of the Batfamily all living together? Will this make any sizeable difference in stories or in how the Batfamily functions? Especially when nobody but Dick, Babs, and Damian really has their own book? And how long before Bruce starts calling them soldiers again, driving them away, only to bring them back together as a family for the umpteenth time? \n\nI don't think Selina acting like she's moving in with everybody else is going to make much of a status quo difference at this point. Come a relaunch she'll probably be living on her own and doing her own thing again.",
            "Honestly, quite the anti-climax for this run. Just a swift attempt to bandage over all  the things that are shoddily broken. They setup SOME hopeful stuff for a new run but as long as DC keeps the same mindset when it comes to Batman, sadly I doubt we will get out of this hamster wheel. Because NOTHING in this run was original or new, despite the fact that it acts like Batman learned some new lesson. \n\nAre they claiming that Zur is gone? If so, why would Failsafe itself would work with Waller and be willing to kill? It only makes sense if Zur is using the Failsafe body.\n\nOverall, only thing I can say is, the next run better not follow the same mistakes.",
            "All of this heartwarming rhetoric would mean so much more if it wasn't about to be deleted in a week. I'm pretty sure Bruce loses his riches to Failsafe again at the start of Absolute Power but I'd love to be wrong.\n\nThe fact that Bruce buried clone-Bruce on the grounds of a mansion at the center of Old Gotham all but assures that some writer's gonna dig him up and make him a villain in the future.

            "Been awhile since a comic frustrated me like this, in that I care about Dick and hate to see him set up this way\n\nBut no one in the BatFam followed the ambulance? And won\u2019t it be relatively provable that Dick disappeared while injured and suddenly he\u2019s supposed to be Heartless what a day later? Like the news would read \u201cDick Grayson collapses in fire, goes missing en route to hospital\u201d followed almost immediately by \u201cHeartless found to be Dick Grayson!\u201d Just feels super obvious he\u2019s being framed\n\nThat said, having him caught holding the gun next to the now dead reporter who publicly challenged him, I get that that\u2019ll carry a lot of weight",
            "There's something so very Tom Taylor in this final arc.\n\nIs this really Dick's first time running a charity?\n\nBabs asking Damian a question she should, by this point, no the answer too. But gotta get the quips in.\n\nTaylor trying hard to make you think Zucco and Heartless are intimidating as antagonists.\n\nDick falling for an obvious trap, getting his identity exposed, and forced into an obvious frame-up for the umpteenth time. I guess there's a certain consistency in that.",
            "Lmao. This is something out of Silver Age. Heartless gets progressively sillier with every issue. Kinda impressive.",
            "Well I guess we got the plan for the fall. Heartless making Dick the fall guy, literally. BUT surely the Bat family would be more aware of the whole thing. After all, they have been in this situation quite a lot. Like, why would they let Dick go alone in that ambulance?",
            "I\u2019ve been shitting on this run quite a lot with the last several issues, and for good reason, but this one was solid! I liked how Dick\u2019s compassion made him go back for the butler. Wasn\u2019t the best idea to go alone but he wouldn\u2019t leave him behind.\n\nKinda wish someone in the batfamily was smart enough to go back inside with their mask\u2026and if Dick had his mask in his suit\u2026why didn\u2019t he have his costume on underneath? Like dude, go full hero.. while I liked the issue, Taylor loves to dumb characters down to move his plots along. Why didn\u2019t Bruce or someone follow the ambulance? Or get in it?\u00a0\n\nLike I said, it\u2019s a solid issue, well paced, not as annoying as Taylor\u2019s previous issues. But the whole concept for this final arc is still SO dumb. He can\u2019t jump? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some unique ability to Dick\u2014all heroes jump from rooftops\u2026and it took him this long to finally address it? For someone so acrobatic, why did he not do something about it sooner?? Another case of Taylor dumbing characters down for his plots.\n\nAnyway, fun issue I guess",
            "Good issue. Nice to have something actually happen for once, and we're finally making progress on the Heartless storyline",
            "Nice issue overall even if i do agree it feels really silly and almost silver age in execution but that is quite rare in mainline comics now so im not complaining. \n\nPlot also feels like its ramping up alot which is good but it kinda feels like its too late as heartless was rarely in the background in previous issues",
            "It\u2019s just Dick being passed out by Shelton before he framed Dick as Heartless. That\u2019s it. Also, Zucco (who should\u2019ve remembered his pre-Crisis and pre-Flashpoint death) learning that Dick is Nightwing. Also, Damian having knowledge of every escape route in every building he enters.

Like I feel like at least Donna and Cassie would have more experience with it but it's surprisingly comical in how hard it is to pilot by anyone not named Diana. Poor Donna and Cassie (actually Cassie felt like the butt of most of the jokes).\n\nI'm glad they didn't give Cheetah a buzzcut. \n\nOne of the best Wonder Woman vs Cheetah fights. \n\nSovereign is just going to mention past Cheetah's and not dive deeper into the continuity implications.  \n\nKing definitely leaned into the DianaxBarbara subtext. Though ultimately it felt like he was just trying to be consistent with their relationship and friendship from Rucka's run and what Cheetah's been through since then. Cheetah is Wonder Woman's greatest nemesis but also one of her closest friends, and that comes through here. At least until the next writer inevitably writes Cheetah as an out-and-out bad guy. \n\nTom King's final redemption of Kite Man with Trinity.",

I feel like she\u2019d be a pretty interesting protagonist in a more mythological-inspired miniseries. \n\nWhat more is there to say about Daniel Sampere that hasn\u2019t been said already? He is one of the best artists at DC and working in superhero comics in general. Every book has been pretty as all hell.",
            "Sovereign narration is back...oh no. I prefer to think Sovereign's ignorant simplifications of characters that he is talking about is because he is clueless and wrong. I sure hope not that is what Tom King really thinks about these characters like Batman and Superman ( especially considering how he wrote Batman )\n\nCheetah is an iconic villain for Wonder Woman sure but I am not certain of the 'I am the only one who really knows you' thing does not really fit.\n\n I liked the contrast and how Cheetah was also had to be captured and put through the ringer to be forced into this fight against Diana instead of just randomly turn back into a villain. And Diana knowing when to win and when to 'lose' to get where she needs to be.  Because yea, if she beat Cheetah there, she would probably be angry enough not to listen. \n\nWonder Girls took their time trying to find the Invisible Jet ( which is hyped up to be a lot  more powerful than it was shown before ). I guess King wants to show how the Jet can be used as a weapon of war and surpass all the other tech but Diana simply never chose to use it that way.\n\nAll of this where we hoped to finally lead to the big battle against Sovereign but now, we have to suffer through the distruption of Absolute Power event where it cuts out all the moment of the story for 3 issues at least.. Why would they do this? It is only gonna hurt the book.\n\nWho cares about the stupid Amazo bot stealing Diana's power and having to deal with Waller before we deal with the actual interesting plot? It is a TERRIBLE decision that DC REALLY needs to stop making. If the book loses its momentum and sales after the event, DC only has itself to blame and continue to be stuck with only Batman at the higher selling rates because of the name. \n\nOn the side story with Trinity, we got to learn how (not) to fly kites, with Damian teaching nihilism/fatalism to a four year-old and Jon being braded Fingerman! But the best part is King bringing in one of his favorites from Batman, KITEMAN to the rescue! Hell Yeah.",
            "This book goes hard as fuck. that's it. Tom King is cooking with Sampere on this one. As someone who has not read through wonder woman's history - I simply do not care. I am really liking how she is written here and I am enjoying the story and the art. what an excellent issue. Tom King is arguably one of the better things that has happened to DC in past few years.",
            "A gorgeous-looking book, as always. Sampere is *the* reason to buy this book, plain and simple.\n\nAs for the plot...It remains kind of loose. Cheetah is back to hating Diana this issue, but then returns to being good or at least good-ish by the book's end, which I'm not really a fan of. It turns Barbara into \nyet another Paula, or Valerie, or Vanessa, or Cale, or Medusa. Is it too much to ask for the most famous and recognizable Wonder Woman villain to remain a villain?\n\nThere's also the bit where Barbara tells Diana that she is the only one who knows her, and...It doesn't really hit, mostly due to Meta-text. This version of Barbara has only existed for eight years, and even if we are working with a hodgepodge of post-crisis continuity with Rebirth overlaid on top of it (I think), Rucka's Rebirth story is the only tale where they really share a strong connection. I guess if nothing else it is kind of interesting to see Cheetah being remolded in real time.\n\nAlso, the space alien learning the human art of speaking that looks like Yara makes another appearance. Good for her.",
            "This issue kinda cemented that king truly knows his history when it comes to diana and her big villains as his use of cheetah this issue and the fight around them and the undertones of the relationship are spot on its such a good part of the issue. It felt like King took tons of inspiration from both perez and rucka here and thats a great place to do it. \n\nThe sovereign narration is back this issue as well whether you love it or don't like it. But i think it works hes a character that seemingly only sees in black and white and with cheetah always being a shade of grey in the modern era it works for the character. \n\nThe only big problem is the wonder girls section you can kinda tell they weren't supposed to be in the  book alot as the dialogue for them is really stiff and its the opposite to the supersons and trinity backup style of dialogue. \n\nBackup continues to be excellent i was hoping for a kite man appearance eventually and king giving him a moment with trinity so she could glide her kite is really wholesome.",
            "I do not give a shit about Wonder Woman, Lizzie is too precious",
            "Welp, I wanted to give King the benefit of the doubt by thinking Cheetah went bad again because of the lasso of lies, I guess not. So we undid her redemption just to have a super rushed redemption again. K\n\nThe Wonder Girls continue to be an afterthought. You mean to tell me Cassie, who has used the sandals of Hermes to fly high and fast because she was once fearless and adventurous, doesn't like heights??? Donna has no personality what so ever and I guess King sees\u00a0Yara\u00a0as the Jason of the Wonder family with her too cool for school attitude.",
            "It\u2019s just Diana and Barbara fighting each other for days before they reconciled and saved each other. Also, even though Diana and Barbara encountered each other since the late \u201880s, they don\u2019t personally know each other. At least we get to see a mentioning of Pricilla Rich (whose pre-Crisis Earth-Two self last appeared in the first Crisis and whose pre-Crisis Earth-One/New Earth/Prime Earth self died) and Deborah Domaine (who was cured by Diana off-panel after the first Crisis). Same thing with Tom King continuing Barbara\u2019s redemption since the forgettable and bad Cloonrad run. Also, Diana still saying, \u201cNo Thank You,\u201d to have a modern and memorable catchphrase like Superman and Batman. Meanwhile, we have the Wonder Girls (Donna, Cassie, and Yara) going on the Invisible Plane to rescue Diana. I like that they want to save Diana while having a friendly banter. The missed opportunity should\u2019ve involved them talking to each other about how they became Wonder Girl, join the superhero teams, deal with romantic relationships and continuity problems, and team ups with Diana. Also, Yara is practically Diana\u2019s Robin because sharing mantles and having a sibling bond. Overall, this comic is okay at best.\n\nFor the Super Sons backup, I thought it was wholesome for Jon and Damian to teach Lizzie how to fly a kite. Also, Jon telling Damian to learn about humility as an old chum because Damian is vengeance and night and Kite Man (Hell Yeah!) teaching Lizzie how to fly a kite. Overall, this is a good and wholesome backup!",

This was paced well, managed to get me attached to Vanadia in just two issues so that I felt the emotions of the conflict hard, and most of all is managing to still keep me invested even as I know it\u2019s far from the first evil Raven story. Also, I saw long-haired Raven in the gem. Stay with us. Please.\n\nBut anyway the real emotional core here is Vanadia, and I can\u2019t stress enough how impressive of a feat it is to make me say that about a character who has existed for two issues. I really like her, and more importantly, I feel for her story and what she represents.\n\nThe art was beautiful and dynamic as well.

Are they gonna leave her dead or rebuild her?",
            "Man, this book is losing the plot, the official summary isn't even a good indicator of what the issue is about.. The evil Raven storyline is one thing, but this side adventure with the Titans fangirl just felt like Taylor spinning his wheels. Why isn't this book connecting to Absolute Power and focusing on this Dark-Winged Queen shit? Are they just getting Beast World and that's it?",

I feel bad that Vanadia was killed by Dark-Wing Queen Raven, but it was expected since Tom Taylor mashed several storylines in his book to make sense for him and not make sense for us (like his two Jon Kent books). Also, it\u2019s likely that the next three issues will end with the Titans saving Raven from Evil Raven and Evil Raven realizing that she does care about the Titans because they\u2019re her family. My only criticism is making every Raven storyline about her being evil because we\u2019ve seen this storyline for 40 years and that it\u2019s unnecessary. Overall, this comic isn\u2019t terrible, but it\u2019s not good either.",

A world of power and the powerless, the worthy and their lessers. \n\nDespite all his narration about how competent he is, the actually substance of what he's saying throughout most of the issues is \"And then my plan was fucked again because I misjudged Wonder Woman\". He's not fully clueless, but he reduces people down to base abstractions, or at least tries to. Heck, him acknowledging they lack a typical foil-relationship may be retrospective.

It would have been nice to see Cheetah\u2019s side too, but I think it\u2019s probably more effective narratively to focus on Diana\u2019s torture and then extrapolate how Cheetah was treated."
