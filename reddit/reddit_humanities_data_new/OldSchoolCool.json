            "My brother in law went to one of this tours shows when Michael came to Australia. What these clips never show is how he hyped the crowd. There was a massive screen overlooking the stage where they played a clip of Michael essentually crash landing into the concert. He'd say things like can you hear me (whatever city he's in) and that he's about to land. Then he'd spring up like this and people lost their shit. My brother in law said people were fainting throughout the entire show, which went for like 2 and a half hours.",
            "Just jumped? Lolllll. This is more than just a jump. I mean, he rocket propelled into the air framed in pyrotechnics and landed in that quintessential MJ pose. Imagine seeing that live in 92.",
            "Bro stands there like he just flew in to whoop Frieza\u2019s ass.",
            "What a great crowd. Everyone just screaming to let Michael know he\u2019s got his underwear on the outside.",
            "So, Michael existed before the internet boom, before social media. He very rarely did interviews. His elusiveness (and obvious mega talent) made him so intensely famous people would faint in his presence. \n\nEverything he did on stage was calculated. The white socks were to bring attention to his feet. The taped fingertips were so people could pay attention to his hands. He wore sequined socks the first time he did his moonwalk so no one would miss the show. He would command the attention of the audience by standing still for long periods of time, then remove just his glasses or his hat or slightly move his head and people would literally pass out. \n\nSeeing Mj in his prime would have been like seeing a mythical figure to a lot of people. He was so big that it was unimaginable for our generation to understand.",
            "SECURITTEEEEHEEEEE!",
            "The most Heavy Metal kid in my school, the kid spent his entire allowance on metal albums.  Celtic Frost, DRI, Exodus, Slayer, etc.   Even he had Thriller in his collection.  And he said, \"Michael Jackson is killer.\"",
            "Fame was concentrated back then. Famous people were VERY famous, and MJ is probably the most famous person that I will be alive to have seen. Distribution was expensive, and attention wasn\u2019t fragmented. Millions went into production for everything that you saw on television. \n\nToday, fame is cheap, attention is cheap, production is cheap, and you just don\u2019t have to be that talented at all to get a following.\n\nNo one will ever be as famous as MJ in our lifetime.",
            "![gif](giphy|guufsF0Az3Lpu)",
            "This is a concert from Romania only a few years after the fall of communism. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t been allowed to listen to western pop music during communism, so this is a big celebration for them. \u00a0And peak level MJ as well.\u00a0",
            "Not to self. Get cod piece",
            "He was like a faith healer knocking people out with his golden dick\n\n![gif](giphy|oX74fzNcSNXAs1eou3|downsized)",
            "If you didnt live thru it, you had no idea how big MJ was. He was global. I had a friend who had long beautiful brown hair and at the height of the craze, she cut it short, got a perm and wore red pleather jackets with zippers. \ud83e\udd23 shit was insane back then. But so fun",
            "I love the man to bits but it astounded me then and still does today just how fanatic people were. The most insane part is that man was capable and absolutely brought it right up to the end. \n\nAn influencer once threw a nickname out as a joke that I have embraced - Poptimus Prime. That was Michael, without question. And the timing of this is interesting - the 25th of June is the anniversary of his death.",
            "I miss those days so much.",
            "It was the later MJ vibe, for sure. I saw him on the Dangerous tour -;which I *think* is this one. Wasn't particularly a fan, my girlfriend was. There was a lot of this sort of stuff. Big and epic show all round tbf. He was a huge influence on how they do live popstar stadium shows these days - as well as pretty much every other aspect of pop music. But whenever I see the huge pop star shows full of AV, choreo, fireworks, moments of theatre like this... I feel like it has roots back to Michael in this sort of era.",
            "And the man lost his life just trying to get a little more sleep. \n\nFuck.",
            "If he gave them a \"hee-hee\" they might have just evaporated.",
            "People don\u2019t realize how seeing him live was literally a once in a lifetime opportunity for many of these girls.",
            "This motherfucker, pops out of the floor. Stands there people are crowd surfing, without a single word from Micheal's mouth.\n\nI've seen some pretty heavy bands and dudes ask the crowd to throw themselves over the barricade... Not Micheal... Just his prescnence alone... Commands the stage... What a god!",
            "I truly believe that the pure nuclear energy of Michael Jackson is incomprehensible to the modern western brain.",
            "This is how I want my rock stars and concerts. Give me a fuckin show! I'm really looking forward to the Missy Elliot concert in a few months. I feel like she's going to put on a kick ass show.",
            "Go watch his Super Bowl show. Man knew how to fucking dominate an audience.",
            "Michael was a hell of a showman. Sad to see him go like he did. \ud83d\ude15",
            "My mom was a flight attendant when MJ was super popular, and once had him as a passenger. Not sure if this was a private flight or if he just bought the plane or what.\n\nShe said that he was actually a little bit awkward, and during whatever interaction they had said \"I like your earrings.\" She said \"Oh thank you!\" and then went to move on with whatever she was doing. One of MJs people stopped her and was like \"That means he wants you to give him your earrings.\"\n\nApparently when Michael Jackson would tell people he liked \"thing\", they would just give whatever it was to him. \n\nMy mom just laughed and did not give him her earrings.\n\nThat's her MJ story.",
            "People losing their shit is an accurate description of what his shows were like.",
            "Just like the Beatles and Elvis before him.",
            "This looks chopped together",
            "I\u2019d love to see a AMA with one of these fans at one of the concerts, especially ones that had fainted and escorted out",
            "90\u2019s was such a great time for music. The guys and gals from the 70s and 80s were mostly still going strong, and there were tons of great new bands from that era too. \n\nI miss the 90\u2019s (and early 2000\u2019s pre 9/11 when everything changed).",
            "I just don\u2019t get it! There is no one in the world either living or dead that I could see having that kind of reaction for",
            "It is impossible to understand in today's age, but absent smartphones and incessant screens,  these folks likely feel like this moment is completely surreal. In their minds, this moment is completely unique and may never be witnessed again, or at least anywhere sufficient to capture their experience. They're 1000% intent on being in that moment vs capturing it to share later.  I wonder if we'd see this happen more if we lost our phones.",
            "He was, and always will be the king of pop.",
            "I find this amazing.  I'm a doctor and I feel like MJ just standing still gets more undivided attention by people than those that I am telling that they have cancer.",
            "He's a legend. I have nothing more to add",
            "That's a lot of mental instability in a really small area. Good lord.",
            "People were more hyped about things back then because they didn\u2019t see the celebrity they liked all the time on social media. \n\nGetting to see them must\u2019ve felt more special. (We\u2019re just desensitised)",
            "Crowd hysteria weirds me out waaaay more than any of MJ's plastic surgery did (which, to be clear, was a lot). I get that some portion of all people are gonna be mentally ill, so could respond strangely in such a situation, but for such massive numbers of people behaving this way in unison just feels kinda dangerous, bad, and off the wall.",
            "I just don\u2019t get screaming and fainting over a rock star or any other star. I guess I just don\u2019t have it in me lol",
            "Mike had that Haoshoku Haki",
            "Mj had that effect on people",
            "He didn\u2019t \u201cjust jump\u201d he exploded out of the stage in fireworks",
            "imagine paying so much for a ticket only to pass out & you wake up to staff cleaning up streamers & everything.",
            "I'll never understand this type of a reaction for anything.",
            "As a GenXer, I truly regret not seeing him on tour.",
            "People say anybody can be famous now with the internet but imagine being so fucking famous that the entire world knows who you are, based off your talent alone. MJ wasn't viral or a meme. He just made it so it was impossible to ignore him because his music was so fucking good",
            "Such an entertainer. Such a shame about the diddling.",
            "Say what you will about the man, but everyone has to admit - *he knew how to ENTERTAIN*!!!",
            "I still remember exactly where I was when I learned of his death.",
            "He died at fifty. Too soon.",
            "Michael was a master of the stage and the audience.\n\nThe Beatles and Taylor Swift fans go crazy when they do fan service. They do something the fans want and the fans go nuts. Taylor has production tricks that make people go ooh, and that whole lore thing is pretty good stuff.\n\nBut Michael is different. When he is on stage, he takes on a persona and also breaks the fourth wall. It\u2019s a bit weird to think of it this way, but he doesn\u2019t come onstage as Michael Jackson, he is Michael Jackson who goes onstage to take the persona of Michael Jackson the pop star. He doesn\u2019t go on stage to sing and dance and do theatrics, he is there to act like a pop star that sings and dances and does theatrics.\n\nWhere most pop stars want to be \u201cgenuine\u201d to their fans, Michael is the opposite - the man on stage is giving a complete performance.\n\nAnd yes, other artists do it. Peter Gabriel, David Bowie, Prince. But everyone knows that\u2019s them. Michael is playing a different Michael, the Michael everyone wants to see, and bizarre and weird as it may be, it totally works.",
            "I don't know if this is cool, I find it terrifying that the mythos generated around one person can drive others to act like this",
            "Superhero treatment",

            "I remember watching this on HBO when it first aired. I was 13 and I fucking loved it.",
            "PSY did something similar at a huge stadium show. The place went nuts! Not really a fan, but his shows look like they\u2019d be a blast.",
            "MJ's halftime show at the Superbowl was the best ever!!!",
            "I can\u2019t fathom how it has to feel to be the person on that stage getting that reaction from ALL of those people. It had to actually be surreal.",

            "Gold bikini bottoms over your trousers was always a solid look for a fella",

            "Taylor who???",
            "I taped this concert when it aired on HBO and wore that shit out over the years. And this clip is cut waayyy short. Between the jump and the head turn, there's a good minute and a half of him standing like a statue, and people continuing to go absolutely bug-fucking-nuts.\n\nThe full concert is on YouTube now, btw. I dunno how this sub is with links in comments, but go search for \"michael jackson bucharest 1992\" and it's the first hit.\n\nWe'll never see anything like him again.",
            "I will never understand how some people can get so insane about seeing a live show.  \nBeing excited? sure. Been there.  \nLosing your mind over seeing a dude stand on stage? Quit screaming. He hasn't even started performing yet.",
            "You can see here how he inspired The Rock for his entrance. Michael was god talent.",

            "Uh yeah, nobody can handle the Golden Penis Protector Power Pose.",
            "I watched this live.",
            "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been said many times before, but I really don\u2019t feel like current generations can understand or grasp exactly the magnitude of who Michael Jackson was. Maybe Swifties? But even then she\u2019s nowhere near MJ",
            "I can't imagine being this excited about anything",
            "I don\u2019t get it. His music is good but not pass out good.",
            "Well, if I jumped at you with my gold bulge you would faint too.",
            "Why was he wearing gold panties?",
            "If you ever wonder why assholes strap bombs to themselves and do atrocities, remember moments like this.  We are wired to love. We are wired to adore a talented leader.  I\u2019m not saying this concert is bad or that we shouldn\u2019t have concerts to prevent this. Quite the contrary. We should have more concerts.  The only point is that people really really have a proclivity to belong and love intensely to the point where outside observers see it and say \u201choly shit what the fuck?\u201d",
            "He had some serious presentation.",
            "Then can all they but there will never be another Michael Jackson. He appealed to everyone and every walk of life.",

            "My clearest memory of Michael Jackson was the movie he was in. I don't remember the name and I don't remember the plot, but I loved it as a kid.",

            "He did the same thing at the Olympic opening ceremony just stood there for 15 min wild",
            "That\u2019s how I expect my bosses to react when I show up on time",
            "This just brought back a memory. When we were kids & a michael jackson video would come on, my cousin would pretend to faint just like the people in this video.",
            "Oh man, my moment to shine. So I build stages at a major events center. Recently I was working with an older gentleman who was a crew manager(basically a really old and knowledgeable roadie). We were working on a stage for an artist that I am not too familiar with, so I\u2019ll leave the details out but I swear, someone mentions Michael Jackson and this dude lit up.\n\nHe talked about building this exact lift and how it would launch Michael 20 feet in the air, and he would nail the landing, day after day, show after show. \n\nThis guy has worked with quite a few talents in his day and all he could talk about was this exact  lift right here in the video.\n\nI wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019m sure it was amazing, but I\u2019m guessing in person it was stunning the way this guy talked about it, nothing compared from then till now and we were literally building a pyrotechnic/lift stage.",

            "People that didn\u2019t grow up in the 80s have no idea how big he was. I don\u2019t think there is any modern comparison except\u2026\u2026maybe\u2026Taylor Swift.",
            "Y\u2019all don\u2019t know what it was like to be famous before the internet. People were basically gods and worshipped equally. And Michael Jackson was the king of all of em.",

            "Remember when Michael sang \u201cHeal the World\u201d during the superbowl? Tensions seemed so high. It was like national rejuvenation. It came on the heels of Rodney King getting beat and the subsequent LA riots. I wish we had something even half as epic to heal the world after the summer of George Floyd. That song still brings tears to my eyes. I think I\u2019m gonna go listen to it now.",

Everyone else is just following his lead and the level of super stardom that he invented. It was Elvis, The Beatles and the MJ who changed music but he was even more special and spectacular.",
            "Before the 2000's, it's weird to imagine, but everyday people didn't have access to the internet and streaming music as it is today. If you had a favorite musical artist, you would have to find a physical store to buy their album, which had close to a dozen songs on it, and you would listen to it on repeat, as part of a very limited set of physical media that one owned. The world was smaller. It was a quaint time to be alive, and to be in awe of something, to be present in a moment, to feel the energy of a room like this--it was rare. Like touching god.",

And then when he got burnt doing the Pepsi commercial.. I wanted every single picture and every single word printed about him. Even the tabloids.\n\nBut, then in 6th grade.. Someone made fun of me and said.. \"Omg you still like him??\" and I was CRUSHED.\n\nSo, after that I had to hide it from people... I had a button I wore on my coat.. But once that happened I had to move it to the inside of my jacket.. All because kids are cruel.\n\nSo then I moved on to Prince.",

A level of cultural obsession and a mystique that has never even been rivaled, although all that have come since MJ have tried to emulate it, it\u2019s just impossible now.\n\nNo one has come along with that kind of vocal talent combined with his dancing ability and style. With a crazy unique look and music that spans genres, I really think it took some voodoo magic or insane one in a billion shot, his parents had to have like 12 children for him to even exist.",

NFL decided to clap back so they hired Michael Jackson. After that, no one dared to step up against the NFL during the Super Bowl. It was the greatest Super Bowl halftime show to ever take place and is arguably the greatest live performance to ever take place. MJ was a global king. Even in Japan he was huge.",

Tickets were $20 for every band at the old Charlotte Coliseum and every one was sold out in days. Live music just doesn\u2019t have the magic it used to. It\u2019s hard to explain, but concerts today just don\u2019t hold a candle to the older days. Maybe it was the fact that musicians put on the show, and didn\u2019t rely so heavy on theatrics behind them.  Absolute best show I\u2019ve ever seen was Skid Row opening for GnR. Skid Row had nothing but their name draped over the amps, and probably half the lights GnR used, but absolutely crushed it.

LETS FUCK UP!\" Then everyone rushed forward. This was a music festival, so you know, blankets, people have their wines, chilling out, it was hosted by Stevie Van Zandt and the Sopranos cast would come up, but Iggy pop got everyone into a frenzy. \n\nAnd James Gandolfini did come out and he's all adorable smiling like we all remember.",
