        "content": "Once again we find ourselves with an inbound update for GTA Online, the Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC. For new people who plan on checking in here on DLC day I want to go over how we usually handle those busy first few hours and general posting requirements on that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. About 30 minutes or so before the DLC releases (\\~4AM EDT) we will lock down the sub. What this means is that we will be filtering posts to help control the flood of posts we normally get in the opening hours so a ton of repetitive stuff and \"Is the dlc out yet?\" posts don't takeover the timeline.\n2. When the DLC releases will will post a Megathread and will be directing most repetitive posts to it. We will work to approve posts as quickly as possible with the first posts on specific DLC discussions being approved. The Megathread will be updated with information as it becomes available, like what platforms the update has been released to already and other information on what we got on launch day.\n3. **SPOILER TAGS MUST BE USED** on all posts discussing missions, characters, and especially plot points for the first 24 hours. Any posts without spoiler tags that contain any of the above listed content may be removed. \n4. **Dripfeed content that gets datamined MUST HAVE A SPOILER TAG** or the post will be removed.\n\nOne more thing, we will be offering a limited time flair for people who come by the sub on DLC release Day (June 25th). \n\n[Limited Time Flair](https://preview.redd.it/amqnalskvy7d1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d31fd4696a0a6e84b97ae511d9a863236e733f)\n\n**To get the flair you will need to do the following:**\n\n* Go to the DLC Megathread we will have pinned on June 25th at 5AM EDT\n* Go to the pinned comment on that post that will also have these instructions\n* Reply to that pinned comment with **#bountyhunter**\n* You'll get an automod PM telling you the flair has been changed\n* Refresh the page to see the flair applied\n\nThis flair will only be available to claim for 24 hours after the DLC is released, so it will end at about 5AM EDT on June 26th. After which the flair will no longer be available to get. \n\n**PLEASE NOTE:**\n\n**If you decide later to change the flair you will not be able to get the Bounty Hunter flair back.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check our pinned [Community Link Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/about/sticky) for links to the most current DLC information.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Because it shares a similar body shape as a rolls doesn't automatically make it a good car. I have a lot of cars that I only have because they look nice but I never drive them because they handle like garbage or they're dead slow. I don't think there good they just look good. The super diamond is fast for a luxury car but handles like a garage truck.",
            "meant to say agree to disagree",
            "All you've told me with this single comment of yours is that, in all of the time you've spent on this game, you still suck at driving.\n\n\nGit gud.",
            "Ayyy, nice to see another Phineas and Ferb Fan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2le4bcixz7d1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfcd5f959914fb7a2f55fdd1cacb4a9183dac5e",
            "Katzennuss",
            "What are you, 5?",
            "Well there is the weaponized tampa if you do want a muscle car with a turret, it's on sale this week.",
            "Adaptability is the mark of a better driver. They might be good with a specific car sure but it's adaptability that makes you an all around good driver.",
            "You\u2019re correct my bad I thought they meant in the mission where you take it to the mansion.",
            "Well yeah but then you're not infiltrating, you're blasting your way in",
            "Oh right yea it was my cake day yesterday I never noticed",
            "You must be fun to play with.",
            "Just don't drive it lol",
            "What if I was talking about THE REAL THING, dumbass?",
            "I do like the tornado. But the clean one for that vintage look.",
            "how u gonna say the rolls acceleration feels like ur skiing but u would rather drive the tornado, such a hypocrite",
            "As a moderator, I can neither confirm nor deny that",
            "Adapting to a vehicle's handling is fun, though. It's a new challenge to overcome, which is awesome",
            "i never said it was automatically a good car, don't put words in my mouth. i said it was based on a rolls royce phantom, which is true.",
            "ya he is, just look at his profile",
            "100% agree. I\u2019m honestly impressed with the GTA 5 car physics. Having driven a bunch of different types of cars, the in game cars really do feel similar and I\u2019m able to predict certain behaviors. \n\nI\u2019ve never driven a rolls Royce phantom but I imagine it\u2019s similar. Many of the super cars have slight differences that match their counterparts and electric cars truly feel like electric cars.",
            "You have to blast whole place anyway.",
            "You gotta get the rusty ones and take them to Benny's. After the conversion you get a really unique clean but faded paint look you can't achieve normally. I have like 4 'lowrider' tornadoes that don't use or treat as lowriders just because I love the look of worn paint look.",
            "As I am not a moderator, I can confirm that.",
            "Have you ever tried the the Vamos, Tulip or E&E exclusive Arbiter GT? If you want challenge, those are your cars.",
            "The original comment I replied to that you are white knighting for implied that. And since you jumped to defend I can reasonably assume you felt the same way. I feel differently, this is a discussion post after all. And discussions are not typically one sided.",
            "The Porsches don\u2019t drive like Porsches though sadly",
            "There's a difference between shooting your way in from the outside and finding a place to unleash chaos from within. I personally prefer going past the DJ, up the stairs and onto the ledge of the roof where I can cover all directions while having cover in return rather than shooting my way in from the outside.",
            "Can't say I've driven the E&E cars, because I played on PC. The other two cars are extremely fun for sure",
            "i \"jumped\" to correct that it is in fact based off of a rolls phantom, which you denied. and rereading the original comment, it isn't even really garbage. it just has different uses. you wouldn't use a jubilee for speed, or a torero xo for armor, or, hell, a rhino tank for drifting. they all just have different ways to be properly utilized.",
            "The Arbiter GT is like them, but HSW, so one helluva bumpy ride",
            "It's on sale this week so make sure you pick one up then.",
            "Makes sense, classic muscle cars do classic muscle car things",
            "i already have vehicles that fulfill the use that a super diamond would, thanks."
