You never had any real reason to think he was dead!\n\nBunch of meme-posters who know nothing about Russia and don't realize Russia's an actual real country of 140 million. So however unlikely it would be for a milblogger to be fighting in the trenches in a Chechen uniform and sneakers, they apparently concluded it's even less likely there would be _two_ men in Russia with red beards. \n\n_English language_ Wikipedia? Seriously?? Get over your main-character syndrome. You really think they're springing to update English Wikipedia to debunk rumors nobody in Russia heard in the first place, not because of censorship but simply because Russians realize they're in an actual country. The kind of Russians who edit English Wikipedia (without getting paid to do so) aren't the kind that are likely to be fans of Pegov in the first place. And believe it or not, Pegov's not exactly a household name in Russia. He's a big name in a small subculture. Meanwhile the Russian-language Wiki page doesn't even bother with the rumor (and nor should they).\n\nMeanwhile in the real world, Pegov was at a meeting with Belousov together with Sladkov, Rudenko, Kots, and some other major milbloggers just a week ago. As is the case every time people post here about this crap. Just a month ago it was Gerasimov, just days after he'd chaired a CSTO meeting, and had publicly gone and voted in the election and other crap. Did that get reported in Western media? No, because they never gave a damn about the unfounded rumor in the first place, and because those appearances in-themselves weren't interesting. Nor are they reporting on Belousov meeting milbloggers because that's not terribly interesting either. \n\nAgain it's main-character-syndrome. Believe it or not, most shit that goes on in non-English-speaking countries is never reported on in any English-speaking media. Just because a bunch of Western kids start circlejerking on Twitter over this-or-that guy being dead - for literally no reason other than \"someone on the internet said so\" - doesn't mean the Russians give a fuck about that, much less are going to go out of their way to disprove that.
