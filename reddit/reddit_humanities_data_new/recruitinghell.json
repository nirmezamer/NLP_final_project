Sad thing is Glassdoor had good reviews and they were voted a good employer. So my question is WHO DID THEY PAY TO GET THOSE GOOD REVIEWS!

He just let me go saying he didn\u2019t need me anymore since I\u2019d straightened things out so well.  I told him it was a bad idea that I had some very important things going on the following week that if not done would be catastrophic.  He said he\u2019d figure it out.  He didn\u2019t change my email password for a week so he found out a week late that the gas company and HVAC company was spending Monday at a building inspecting furnaces and getting the gas turned on in the empty 8 unit apartment building.  Since I wasn\u2019t available to give them the codes to enter and authorize any work it didn\u2019t get done.  A major below zero cold spell hit days later and caused over $60000 damage to the building from pipes freezing then flooding,  He didn\u2019t have insurance on this building.  My yearly salary was $55000.  He blames me for the destruction even though I told him there were a few things I needed to reel him out of common courtesy and he refused and said he\u2019d figure it out.   The kicker is I also had a deal with a veterans center that was going to fully rent the building for a bit more than he expected.  I even had someone interested in purchasing the building for a profit.  All that never happened without me as it was all in my notes and all calls done with my cell phone.

            "When I did graphic design over 15 years ago I was looking for a steady job to keep everything afloat. I vaguely knew the owner of a big PC retailer and saw that he had an internship available for graphic design for pretty much every aspect of the business. I respected the company and was a customer up to that point and so I contacted the owner to see if he was up for switching the internship into a part time job. He seemed interested and put me in contact with the current person in charge of design. I've gotten the assignment to create a brand identity package for the website and social media, not a major overhaul but an upgrade of their work up to that point. It was to see if my skill was up to the task and after evaluation we'd follow up with terms and conditions. So I've put in a weeks worth, wanted to show my value as everything seemed trustworthy at that point. Ghosted for two weeks, did not even get a reply for my follow up email 4 days after delivery. After two weeks I got a message from the designer guy that they have revised their plans and won't go through with the job offering or any internship. A month later I see heavily inspired work done on the website that resembled my work. It wasn't an exact replica but you'd know if you'd seen what I've made for them. I contacted both again and only got a reply from the designer guy that it was a coincidence and in line with current trends and absolutely not based on what I've sent them.

It's one thing to be familiar with your own industry's jargon, but when you are applying for a job in a different industry than the one you are currently in, it is absolutley wise to give your resume a once over and replace jargon with more generic terms. \n\nA good example of this is people who have recently separated from the military. A lot of career military people have VERY impressive resumes (I think) but it's really hard to translate military jargon into civilian speak. When your resume has been built over 20 years to advance in the military, but suddenly you're applying for jobs in the manufacturing or sales field, it's a lot harder for people to relate what they are seeing on your resume to the job you're applying for.

If you are working in one position for more than 6 months, I think the difference starts becoming less and less and gets made up mostly by being promoted to a different position.\n\nHowever, another commenter is completely right when they say the exact timeline will be captured on the background check.

            "> They went off on a weird tangent about math\n\nI figured it was a joke?\n\nLike 2023 - 2024 is a maths problem, Jun 2023 - April 2024 is a date range.",
            "They're probably looking for gaps in employment to use as an excuse to reject...",
            "Why does that matter though? Even if you were only there for 1 year, you still did the job, which is what matters.",
            "2023 minus 2021 is anything from 1 to 3 years. Depending if you started in January and finished in December, or started in December and finished in January.\n\nShe is also saying that the exact date is useless, what really matters is the tenure, which is unclear.\n\nIt's all valid criticism and advice, but expressed in a way that is \"social media optimized\", not in a way to be immune from misunderstanding.",
            "All verifications can be done through the background check. That's the reason for it. If someone wanted to lie on binary questions, they could also lie on their resume. Putting fast checks like what I'm saying just helps clarify what is important to the candidates so that they know if it is likely they will be interviewed and/or should even continue the application. Same goes with everything done before background checks. It is to help filter for the right people, knowing that you can't filter out liars or others mentioned until the background check.",
            "And you're sure it doesn't filter out anyone that is honest?",
            "The \"automated resume filtering\" of which you speak is by and large, crap. I don't know of any recruiter who makes use of it.",
            "quite sad since the only person in their \"right\" mind liking that comment, would be another recruiter, and it's sadder that they don't take their areas of opportunity seriously, when really all they are, are recruiters. Sure there are over-the-top recruiter certificates and stuff to make being a recruiter look...more important than it is, but at the end of the day...you're just an interviewer, like. So, you definitely have things to learn. But no, you just want to bitch about applicants.",
            "That's spending an extra 25 minutes on like a third of applications for some fringe aesthetic appeal",
            "So when you hire them you give them a \"formal\" job description along with their offer letter. That can't be that hard?\n\nI asked my HR for a job description, and they gave me a copy of a vague job posting.  lol.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t do this on my CV, but most recruiters I\u2019ve spoken to don\u2019t know enough about what is involved in the jobs I\u2019ve done to be able to tell the difference between someone who\u2019s done them for a total of 3 years and someone who\u2019s done them for 5 years. If two candidates have the same CV except one has done one of their roles for 1 year and the other has done it for 3, I wouldn\u2019t trust a recruiter who decided the second person must be better based on that information alone.",
            "It really is that easy, but most companies refuse to believe it",
            "Could be, but I think the more likely scenario is that it makes a difference whether you have 1 year of experience, or 3 years of experience.",
            "How long you did the job matters for judging how much experience you realistically gained.",
            ">All verifications can be done through the background check.\n\nCorrect. But you are not going to waste your time calling/interviewing a candidate who clearly falls below the minimum threshold for the position and/or is significantly less experienced than other candidates in the slate. \n\n>someone wanted to lie on binary questions, they could also lie on their resume\n\nCorrect. And you would logically withdraw such a candidate's offer when you discover that. So you are just making my point for me that \"binary questions\" are ineffective. \n\n>Putting fast checks like what I'm saying just helps clarify what is important to the candidates so that they know if it is likely they will be interviewed and/or should even continue the application.\n\nOr, wild idea, candidates can be read the job requirements before applying, so that they know if it is likely they will be interviewed and/or should even continue with the application. \n\n>Same goes with everything done before background checks. It is to help filter for the right people, knowing that you can't filter out liars or others mentioned until the background check.\n\nOr, people could just make a reasonable effort to make sure that their resumes are up to date before they decide to spam it out to 100 companies as a first impression of who they are. \n\nDishonest people are going to be dishonest no matter what you throw in front of them. In a world full of people who cannot be fucked to update their resume before starting their job search, why wouldn't someone take a few minutes to update one of their most important documents? The bar has never been lower, it doesn't take much to stand out.",
            "... even more reason to read to whole resume then?",
            "You are playing the game wrong. Spent the better part of my career working with managers who discard resumes in word format. But all good you do you bo. I'm just trying to help people here.",
            ">So when you hire them you give them a \"formal\" job description along with their offer letter. That can't be that hard?\n\nThat's precisley what I'm saying.",
            "Plenty of people who\u2019ve been working for a long time are terrible at their jobs compared to their more junior colleagues.",
            "If we are assuming everyone is lying before the background check, then that should be the first step. The reason it isn't is because it is actually more helpful to assume they aren't lying. That's why having binary questions help. Because you assume you they are honest and know what they are talking about and can easily filter out the ones who are honest but don't meet requirements.\n\nCandidates don't trust job descriptions for three reasons. \n\nFirst, many job descriptions give completely wild requirements. Most of the jobs I look at in my field require a masters and 5 years of experience or a PhD and two years of experience just to move and measure liquids in small containers. It is assumed by candidates that the employer is just throwing out \"requirements\" not because they have good reason or because they feel strongly about them, but because they just want the top candidates.\n\nSecond, there is a lot of inconsistency between companies as well as inherent vagueness. Some companies have requirements. Some have preferred qualifications. Some have both. Sometimes they look switched. There is no stated strength or threshold for requirements anywhere. If you require 5 years of experience, is 4 and 11 months fine? Where is the line? If you have a preferred qualification of knowing Spanish, will that make the requirements less strict? If so, by how much? I'm sure for your company specifically you can likely answer all these questions, but do you think you could speak for all companies? And further, are the answers to these clear on the job description?\n\nThird, the complete and utter lack of feedback leaves candidates with little to no information to base anything off of. You almost never receive a reason for rejection past \"other candidates were better\" nowadays whether or not that was true and they actually hired (I'm looking at you, infinitely reposted jobs). With this lack of information, it's hard to tell how often companies stick strictly to what they've said. Do 80% of companies reject everyone that doesn't 100% meet the requirements? What about 90%? What is reasonable here? That's the problem, nobody knows so it's all based on hearsay and anecdotes.",
            "I understand you are conveying your experience and trying to help. I'm also conveying my experience here. It can and will significantly reduce your application volume. If using a word document completely counteracts the time saved is beyond me, but it shouldn't. The only way that we would reach that conclusion is if hiring managers and recruiters are so overly concerned with aesthetics that most of them will throw away a resume just based on file type. If that is the case, I would love to have the evidence. Until then, I will cross my fingers and hope that our world isn't that stupid because I would have to reckon with all the faith in other people I just lost otherwise",
            "I understand why external/internal job descriptions sounds better in theory.  As a candidate who has just had to jump through a whole bunch of hoops to get the job offer this would feel like a bait and switch.",
            "It probably depends on what jobs we are talking about but ramp up time is a real thing. You need some time to gain context. \n\nIf amount of time was irrelevant, you wouldn't be putting years anyways since a single day on the job makes you as good or better than existing employees.",
            "If i can put out all the evidence that i collected over the years i will and it will come soon. I am less than 2 years away from leaving the field for good. I plan to write a tell all. I got shit on Amazon BoA and now in pharma. Not saying the company yet.",
            "Obviously I agree that doing 5 jobs for 1 day each is worse than doing them for 1 year each. But if 2 candidates did 3 jobs for a total of 4 years vs 2 jobs for a total of 5 years, for example, any recruiter who claims they can tell the second candidate is better based only on their CVs is lying to you.",
            "Do it, I'm excited to read it",
            "In the example you gave it might be worth taking to both candidates but the second one is more likely to give you a better return on investment. \n\nThe problem when you get someone who never gets past a year or so is that a lot of their knowledge stays surface level because they're less likely to be exposed to the more complex parts of the job until their ramp up period is done. \n\n1 year vs 3 years is the difference between a junior and a mid level in many professional fields so it definitely matters when you go to make that decision.",
            "Most of it is written already with tons of shit i shouldn't put in there. But i can't f up my career just yet haha. I'm less than 2 years away from being semi retired and moving back to my first career. Just wanted to save for retirement first. I am barely doing enough now at work. Just passing the time. \n\nShit just last week i was talking with a director who overseas diversity hire. Guy says in voice chat \"did we hire enough finally please the damn public\". God wish i had that one captured. \n\nI'm lucky i worked myself into a very high BA role over the years. All i do is present data to directors and recruiting managers."
