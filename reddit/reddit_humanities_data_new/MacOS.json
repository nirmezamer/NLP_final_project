Today an intenal process suddenly started downloading these images / videos (.jpg and .mov files from sylvan.apple.com) and filling up my SSD. There\u2019s no way to stop this.\n\nWith LittleSnitch I was able to find the process that was downloading these massive amounts of data (and consuming huge CPU load) and block the coreresponding domain. After that I was able to locate the downloaded files and delete them manually (almost 8GB).\n\nThis is crazy that Apple is doing this without even noticing or asking the user, whether he wants to have gigabyte-wise 4K wallpapers or not.",

I have to force quit knowledgeagent multiple times a day. Today it used 44.8 GB of my 32 GB of memory. This was supposed to be a powerhouse Mac with the M1 Pro but Siri makes it non-functional most days. \n\n  \nI also have the Studio Display and if I don't reboot my Mac before a Zoom call, the camera will show a black screen. It's ridiculous.",
            "Below also posted to Apple Community: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255447016?sortBy=best  \n\n\nI have a Macbook Air M1 purchased in December 2023. My daughter updated to Sonoma 14.3 and ended up with the following issues immediately after the laptop restarted:\n\n\\- Unable to log in with TouchID\n\n\\- Unable to log in with a password\n\n\\- Menu bar apps appeared with question marks and no icons\n\n\\- System preferences / System Settings failed to open\n\n\\- All video apps, including Zoom, YouTube, Google, and Netflix were unusable\n\n\\- The laptop seemed extremely slow and unresponsive.\n\nAfter much research (googling and redditing) I booted in safe mode.After the initial reboot while in Safe Mode, the laptop seemed much better but the video issues persisted, and the TouchID and password issues remained.\n\nSystem settings at least started opening.  The remaining video and password issues were deal breakers as my daughter uses this laptop for school (she's in her final year) and she needed the laptop urgently today.\n\nOn the TouchID \\\\ Auth issue, the laptop would authenticate perfectly well from a reboot, but when the laptop woke from sleep (closed lid/timeout), login failed to recognize the password or the fingerprint. It required a reboot to be able to log in. It was quite unbelievable to me that a billion-dollar company could release a software update that leaves people in this predicament. That entire technical team ought to be fired for releasing that garbage update.\n\nI eventually decided to attempt to restore the original OS by booting into recovery mode (holding down the power button after powering on). After two attempts (the first one failed claiming MY internet connectivity had been lost...) the second attempt worked. I expected that the version of Sonoma would be downgraded to 14.1 or 14.2 but I was pleasantly surprised. When the laptop booted up, TouchID worked for the first time since the issue started. After logging in we tested YouTube / Netflix / Zoom and they all worked perfectly.\n\nWe shut the lid and we were able to log in with both password and TouchID.It seems the restoration of the OS worked to fix all the issues we were experiencing.\n\nBut for Apple to put people in this situation in the first place is just crazy.",

I stream 1x every 2 weeks and my MacBook Air M1 (2021 or 2) which I guess is silicon?) decided to upgrade to Sonoma against my will this past week. Now I can\u2019t use Splitcam for live streaming because although it registers it as a camera alternative drop down, it won\u2019t show the filters i took hours getting perfectly. It only displays the real me aka FaceTime HD camera which I am very ugly on. I need filters! I read thru apple community\u2019s 500 steps to get it back to normal and I\u2019m lost. So my questions are this:\n1. how do I get the stream sites to show the *filtered* Splitcam camera not just Splitcam disguised as FaceTime hd? I also have a razor Kyzer camera attachment but it doesn\u2019t pick up the filtered splitcam either. And I have downloaded the most recent version of split which they state coincides with the newest iOS upgrade (that it does not). \n2. What specifically do I need to do with my MacBook Air to get this accomplished? Reinstall Sonoma? Delete it? I tried reinstalling it and I think it just added more drama.  There\u2019s too many vague, although lengthy, instructions on apple community for me to know what route I should go. \n3. If these are not possibilities or something that will take less than 2 hours to do, then what other camera *beauty* filter app/drivers works with the most recent version of Mac iOS (Sonoma?) I read that they\u2019re only accepting certain camera drivers bc, well, they\u2019re finicky mfers. \nThank you in advance for trying to decipher this divinci code.

            "i got used to doing the very same thing when apps were happy to track me, and when memory leaks were worse than they are now (but don't kid yourself; there are still memory leaks in some apps). Anyway, I continue to do so.",
            "I close documents, but almost never close apps.  They don't really take up resources when you aren't using them.\n\nFor many years now, macOS has supported automatic quitting of apps with no open documents, but only if the app explicitly supports this behavior.\n\nI'm pretty sure all Apple apps support this. I just tested and confirmed that this works with Preview, TextEdit, and Pages.  (Though when you first open those apps, they show an \"open\" dialog.  They won't auto-quit if that dialog box is open.)",
            "I use SwiftQuit which quits the app if all the windows are closed. I have some things on the \u201csafe list\u201d so that they\u2019ll stay open (like Apple Music, for example). I know it\u2019s not necessary, but I don\u2019t like the white dots on the dock icons (OCD)",
            "Been using MacOS for about 1.5 years and I close and quit almost everything when I\u2019m not using it, or when I put my Mac to sleep for the night. You\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t have to do this and can just open my MacBook in the morning and pick everything up where I left off? That might be a game changer for me",
            "yeah because I use CMD+Tab and the undead apps still appear on the list so they get in the way",
            "I have a habit of closing anything I am not actively using. Tabs, apps, windows, everything.",
            "Yes I do. Part of it is due to an old habit from the 64/ 128 mb ram on 98/ xp days when I had to choose between music, browsing or playing a game. It never went away, despite having 64gb on my windows laptop or 16 on my minis. \n\nIt\u2019s also part OCD, I like having everything clean in my computer, inlcuding not having apps open. \n\nThe only app that I never close is the mail app, the rest get a command q as soon as I am done with them.",
            "Almost never. My habit is to either just close the document window (command-W) or Hide (command-H) the app, since opening an app which has been quit (command-Q) can take longer than one which is simply hidden. No issues with battery life or memory usage from hidden apps, at least not any that I use.",
            "I always CMD+Q resource heavy apps like Adobe\u2019s but lightweight stuff I just leave in the background.",
            "Never. All 5 virtual desktops host the same app layouts for years\ud83d\ude02 i am so used to it.",
            "Yes but principal reason is it\u2019s annoying to command tab through inactive apps.",
            "Closing apps you don't need for extended periods makes sense on macOS.\n\nUnlike iOS, macOS lets apps continue to actually run and do some work, not just in the form of restricted background tasks like playing music, videos or download things. They continue to consume memory and processor time but may be partially swapped out to disk and slowed down if idle.\n\nmacOS has App Nap to reduce energy consumption by apps idling around or running in the background, see\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/AppNap.html\n\nIt is not the same as (some, not all) iOS apps being put to a complete stop while not active and preserving their entire state, though.",
            "I do a mix - frequently used apps like email and browsers are kept running all the time, but I quite less frequently used apps when I'm done with them. A large reason for this to minimize the amount of visual clutter (number of app windows, number of icons in the Cmd-Tab bar, number of icons in the Dock etc \u2026)\n\nThis also has a minor benefit in that I free up memory, so I will end up with less memory swapped to disk. More swap will occur if you keep a lot of apps running - i.e. use more memory. In practice there will be little difference as loading an app from disk or loading it from swap is pretty similar performance wise, though a restart will be faster if the app is still in the (RAM based) file cache.\n\nThere may also be cases where one might keep an app running because it doesn't resume properly or because it restarts slowly.",
            "I only close apps that I don't use daily. Apps that I keep open include safari with all my tabs, both mail and outlook ( personal and work email ), word cause I have various docs open most of the time, and lastly whatsapp ( If I close it and then open it when I want, it first loads all the messages before I can reply to anything so I keep it open. ) \n\nAny other app I use gets cq ed after use.\n\nEdit: Forgot bout the background apps like maccy, rectangle, drive, aldente, etc, which are also open 24/7.",
            "It really depends on what it is. I pretty much always have Safari, Messages, Mail, Teams (on work days), and Apple Music open as I may not be doing something in them at this time, but will always bounce around these three periodically. \n\nOccasional leave open programs are Discord, Calendar, Todoist, and MS Edge but not 100% of the time.",
            "Almost never. Cmd+W and on Fridays I turn off the computer until Monday",
            "Yes since my Mac only has the \"suitable\" 8GB RAM recommended by Apple.\n\nOtherwise, it would slow down/freeze a while when a lot of apps are loaded.",
            "I used to have a workflow to quit most of my applications. It lets you choose to quit all running applications but you can specify a few exceptions for things that you might be having a conversation in, like Messages, FaceTime or Zoom.\n\nI don\u2019t have it anymore. Temporarily having 8 GB force me to be more aggressive about quitting applications as soon as I was done with them.",
            "Yes, except for chrome, which constantly has 30+ tabs open.",
            "Nope.\n\nNot quitting an app every time you close the last document/window actually makes things cleaner and faster if it\u2019s an app you\u2019re going to use often.\n\nLet\u2019s take MS Office, say Excel.\n\nI used to work in project dev, and there\u2019s always an Excel file to work on. When you\u2019re done with a file, you click X on the window or Alt+F4 it. If there are a lot of files open, that\u2019s all no biggie. But when you X that last file, it also quits Excel, because it\u2019s a force of habit to Windows users to close windows with the upper right X button or Alt+F4.\n\nSo then 5 minutes later I need to open another spreadsheet and now I\u2019m greeted with the damn Excel splash screen and the app needing to find its bearings for a second or two as Windows now needs to load Excel again back into memory and get things in order.\n\nThe thing about MS Office is that they actually have controls to mimic the behavior of Mac apps. Documents have their own X button and close document command, which behaves the exact same way as hitting X on the main window and Alt+F4 IF there is more than one document open in the app. But most people don\u2019t know that because unlike apps that do the same, say Photoshop, the default view is not a sub-window nor is it tabbed; it just looks like the main app window is also the document itself.\n\nBecause of this crummy design, you always just close the app when you\u2019re done with the last instance. It\u2019s not that big of a deal these days, but I pity you if you had to relaunch MS Office in the early 2000s, or if you have a 2010s machine.\n\nMac though confusing to Windows users at first is pretty straightforward. Click red stoplight on the window, it closes the window. Click quit on the app menu to close it, it closes the app. Same with shortcuts, Cmd+ W closes window, Cmd+Q closes app. Window = window, app = app.\n\nSo it becomes simple for me: \n\n- will I need it later? Close window.\n- am I sure I\u2019m not going to need this today again? Close app.\n\nAnd because I\u2019m quite familiar with my workflow, I don\u2019t really think of closing windows vs apps. Need it later = Cmd+W, pack it up and leave = Cmd+Q.",

It just takes longer to restart, hitting battery, and in general is just a waste of time. If you have 16gb or more RAM I don\u2019t see a reason to close apps.

Of course on iOS/iPadOS you can see everything open in the app switcher, but it\u2019s easy to keep out of sight. \n\nWhereas yeah on macOS/Windows, you constantly see everything open. Even if you hide it, you can still tell it\u2019s open. Haven\u2019t given Linux a shot, I\u2019ve been a macOS user since 2014, but I\u2019ve been slowly getting interested in PC gaming, and I don\u2019t like the way Windows is going; recently got a Steam Deck and it performs well in Linux, there\u2019s a few issues with the games I play, but overall Proton is incredible\u2026 so if I ever decide to build a gaming PC I might shove Linux (probably Fedora) onto it instead of Windows",
            "This is why I think the intended behaviour is to quit apps that aren't in use. Several things are made more messy or convoluted by never quitting apps, for example the Dock and Command-Tab features being full of random icons.\n\nThe best way and simplest way imo is to Command-Q (quit) apps you're done with. If you're not done with them though, or need to come back in the morning, feel free to leave them open, sleep the computer, whatever, you'll usually be fine. No need to leave Notes or Preview open constantly though just in case you need it (also no need to necessarily *not* have it open except that that icon will be bugging you in Command-Tab/Dock needlessly).\n\nThe system is pretty versatile for users of different skillsets but I wish Apple would make it a little more clear here what the intended behaviour is",
            "\"Automatic Termination\" was indeed what I was thinking of, sadly there doesn't seem to be a column entry for this in Activity Monitor.\n\nIt's been 7+ years since I've done any macOS app development, so I guess that I kind of forgot that Automatic and Sudden Termination where two different things."

I'm not happy with Photos but I'm trapped in it and pondering my abilty to escape. \n\nJust to explain, what i dont like is that everything is in one huge database and Ive had a couple of times its misfired and taken me ages to fix. Most recently (just last month) it renamed one person to another and forgot a second, but only when those two people were in the same photo. This was literally hundreds of photos. This had gone unnoticed for some time so even Time Machine was of very limited help.\n\nI'll check out graphics converter. That might be a winter project for me.",

Photshop might have some advantages but at a significantly higher price.\n\nThe GC author is also very active on the GC forums. Any problems/questions, you'll get an answer usually within a few days. If he thinks it a good idea, he will also implement changes asked for by users, something neither Apple nor Adobe ever do - I wanted to rename a set of image files with reference to a spreadsheet which listed current file names and new file names. He implemented this within a couple of weeks.",
            "Thanks.  And I see from the forum it has face recognition.\n\nJust to be fair to Photos you can put the database wherever you want and you can have alternates which you can switch between. All still one humungous database though.  \n\nSo, my plan would be, export each album to a new location under a top level folder, lets call it GCImageDatabase. And the album name would be <location> or <event> eg i might have Hawaii2018 and CraftFair2011 etc folders. All under that central folder. And then point GC at that. I presume it does also create its own Db to cross reference pictures, eg pictures that contain \"Fred\" or pictures of a whale, or pictures in Hawaii, whatever? (Photos is good at locations)\n\nAlso as its shareware i can try it (I would buy if it works for me)\n\nNext step, I'm looking for more disks !\n\nI dont do a whole lot of editing but i did buy PIxelmator, does GC work with third party editors ?Worst case i can export out and back again if i dont like the tools in GC"
