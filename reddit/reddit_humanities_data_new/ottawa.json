I\u2019m looking at my balance today and I\u2019m shocked. \nThe only \u00ab\u00a0fun\u00a0\u00bb thing we spend money on are 2 gym membership we use regularly. And Netflix. My kids aren\u2019t even in any sport or extracurricular that cost money. They go to free activities. \nWe are going out with friends tonight and I feel like cancelling. Still 8 days till my pay check.\nWe own one car (not sure how the expense will climb with gas with more days in the office - right now we are hybrid).\n\nI have not had go live pay check to pay check for a long time. I\u2019ll have to go to the bank to stop the Rrsp or something. How is it that a 2 income family with relatively few expenses has to watch that bank account has to cancel on plans with friends? \n\nBtw I know eating out is not a necessity but I\u2019m giving this as context. Before covid we could eat out and even take trips. If we\u2019re now struggling I can\u2019t imagine what others less fortunate are doing. \n\nIt\u2019s like the money that comes is just flying out.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other families are doing it. My heart goes out to anyone looking for a job.\n\nI woke up this morning very early because the anxiety is messing with my sleep and my health. I really hope anyone looking for a job or in a worse position finds some relief.\n\nI\u2019m in constant fear of one of us losing our jobs. I\u2019ve gone from an ambitious member of society to a submissive employee doing what im told out of fear of losing a job.\n\n",

I immigrated in 2012 and in the first 5 years until 2017 I had saved up 100k which is 20k saving per year where I had half of what I earn now and we used to travel a lot during that period as we did not have a kid.

            "What everyone is actually complaining about here is inflation. The federal government printed way too much money during covid, they spent it on useless frivolous things with no plan. The government then asked the BoC to raise interest rates to bring down inflation (opposed to cutting back their own spending fyi) and now every day people are feeling the effects of it. It is a fact of politics, liberals (left) spend money, conservatives(tight) cut spending, this cycle has existed since our fathers fathers father. The world got shafted and manipulated by big pharma over covid and the sitting government threw money at the problem. Our dollar is now worthless, weve dropped the penny in physical currency, and the cost of literally everything is through the roof.\n\nIn 2025/2026 there will be another mortgage crisis and people are going to start losing their homes, there was a segment on CBC (pretty sure) just last week. Once people start losing their homes through default after mortgage renewals the available housing supply will be even more stretched because people who saw the signs and planned accordingly will be in a position to use their own money to get something new/better/different and those who used the banks money will be forced out of ownership and be looking to rent or downgrade. Unfortunately theres a lot less people invested in their financial future and performance than people who see money and spend it. Ultimately this should lead to a decline in housing problems but this is not a single tier issue.\n\nThe recent influx of immigration has also stretched the housing market, Canada has let in more people than were able to support. Healthcare, policing services, housing, welfare programs, foodbanks are all stretched thinner than ever before. Recently the government has reduced the number of people coming in through visa and pissed off India which is the main source of immigration to Canada. They also said they will begin looking at correlating immigration to infrastructure support but that will take years to be implemented and see the effects of. They granted residency to 1M+ people a year in a country of only ~34M when it started, and we werent building homes and hospitals, hiring police officers and doctors, nurses and paramedics or bolstering support for other programs. It was okay let em in and figure it out later. Now the country is fucked for the next 12 years and all regular people can/will do is try to make the best of it and complain on the internet.",

Wow!\n\nI cycle the canal most frequently, and I try to ring in advance enough to alert (yet not scare) the pedestrians\u2026 \nI always give the right of way, and always signal my intention (if I need to, for those behind me)\n\nThe ones I ring for 100% of the times are:\n\n- people with dogs (suggestion: when you hear a bell, keep that leash short and tight, I don\u2019t want to scare or injure your pup)\n\n- people with small children or strollers (as a parent myself, I know that toddlers are wild and unpredictable and may unexpectedly run into my path, so it\u2019s an alert for moms and dads to be ready for that unpredictability)\n\n- people fishing (I do not want a hook in my cheek, so please: don\u2019t cast now!)\n\n- people who look they might be a tourist (slowly walking and looking around, taking photos, etc\u2026 they may not know the etiquette\u2026.and then all of a sudden cross to the look at the map!) \n\n- joggers/walkers (You know the etiquette, \nyou stick to right but maybe can\u2019t hear my bell because you\u2019ve got ear buds in, but I ding my bell anyway!)\n\n- intersections or benches, especially along the canal\u2026 ding! (Pedestrians forget to shoulder check even when walking - Ding ding look out!)\n\n- tunnels\u2026ding! (You maybe can\u2019t see me cause I\u2019m in it, but you\u2019ll hear me \u2018ding!\u2019 And now know to stay wide in your own lane)\n\nThe 1% when I don\u2019t ring my bell is when I pass the people I regularly see on my daily commute who know the deal. OR when I\u2019m cycling behind  someone who already  rang theirs\u2026. But it would have to be tight. I\u2019d most likely ring mine again to let them know there was another passing. They don\u2019t know!!!! There could be a swarm of beginner  12-year-old tourists out on a bike tour! \n\n\nFor clarity: I\u2019m also the cyclist that wears a helmet always, turns on the lights, wears high viz gear when I can and actually stops at stop signs and red lights\u2026 and waits. Bike nerd? I dunno\u2026\n\nI want to get from point A to point B safely on my bicycle.  And I do. Every day. Following the rules of the road, and the etiquette of the multi-use pathways. \n\nIf, after all these defensive cycling techniques, I was tragically killed in a cyclist vs. vehicle collision, my family will be safe in the knowledge that I did my very best, and was not at fault. \n\nUgh, that ended on a grim note. Good. Think about it. \n\nAny other cyclists feeling the same?",

I am terrified of a cyclist killing or hurting one of my dogs because I don't know the cyclist is coming.  Hearing the bell gives me time to pull the dogs over to, or off the edge of the path to keep them and me safe.  And hitting one of my dogs might actually cause the cyclist to be injured too.\n\nPlease, keep ringing your bell! It makes a world of difference. Thank you to all bell-ringers.",

Personally, it feels like a \"get out of my way\" horn, especially when people are going fast and give you 0.3 seconds notice... But I've gotten better about not doing a panic scatter into the wrong direction!\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I bike, I just give people a 2-3 people space in-between. If I can't, I'll say something like, \"Heads up, passing on the right... Have a good one!\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf people are in a group talking, wearing headphones, have a dog, etc. then I ding well before.\u00a0",

So people either take needless alarm at hearing the bell (and turn or jump) or get inured to it and learn to ignore it.\n\nAs a pedestrian, I'm generally fairly aware of my surroundings. And just in case not, I wouldn't do anything surprising without looking over my shoulder. So it's really not bringing me information or affecting my actions, just adding noise.\n\nHowever, I know some elderly people who are less aware and appreciate it. And I'm sure there are others. And it has become a guideline. So I'm learning to tolerate it and not feel I have to react, that people ringing are not feeling there's imminent danger or that they're hyper-important and I should get out of the way, they're just doing what has -- for better or worse -- become good manners.\n\nBy the way, I am an occasional cyclist, and I do follow the guidelines and give a little tinkle.",

I've been doing this for years now and the number of instances of nearly crashing into people or startling them has gone down significantly. \n\nThe number of people who jump in surprise when you ring or call out is unbelievable, especially when they jump to the left directly in front of you",
            "Same thing happens to me all the time!! I find that when I ring, people scatter, whereas when I say something they just look and don't move",
            "Same.  Sadly, for the \"person has headphones\" it really doesn't matter what you do.  I still do it, though.",
            "Same! I personally hate when cyclists ring when I\u2019m walking, so I only ring in those circumstances.",
            "Same!",
            "Same as well!  I find that a pedestrian will typically hear me coming anyway, as my chain lock is usually clanking somewhat against the vertical bar under the seat.  I also keep watch on them as well for a slight turn of the head or some other subtle body movement to indicate that they have indeed heard me. I'm certainly not pedaling full tilt along the pathway like a maniac as I go by either, more of a gentle coasting and always as far to the left as possible.\n\nHowever, I do ring on that rare occasion when there's a group of people on the pathway ahead and it's just not possible to pass them by without doing so.",
            "I have one on my bike as well.  Absolute best bell made.  Loud but easy to modulate the loudness.  Very long sustain of a very pleasant tone.\n\nAnd it looks cool.  ;)\n\nEdit:  They are also stupidly expensive.  There is a cheap China knock off you can get.  Avoid it.  They're crap.",
            "Same. I\u2019ve clocked over 4,000 km on my bike in Ottawa and have never had anyone \u201cpanic scatter\u201d right into my path after ringing my bell.",
            "Amen!",
            "Passing on the right?  Thats not the way. Pass on the left. Help the pedestrians learn that bikes pass left consistently just like cars. No one should pass on the right on an mup.",
            "More like 3 percent",
            "You pass on the right?!",
            "Panic scatter \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23.  Would make a good band name or song title",
            ">To me it's a danger warning that you may hit me if I don't get out of the way. \n\nYes, that's exactly the point.",
            "Pretty sure the highway traffic act does not govern bicycle use on multi use pathways.",
            "For real. r/Ottawa is ringing. There will be no rest for spirit ashes near bike paths.",
            "I'm the same as you but appears we are the minority. If someone has kids or a dog I do ring but other than that I don't.  Most people have headphones and can't hear.  I always pass far on the left as well and am not one of those assholes who tries to squeeze between pedestrians, I will wait until lane is clear.",
            "You shouldn't have to do anything about the bell. It doesn't mean move over, it just means heads up, and now is not a good time to suddenly veer left.",
            "This, I seldom ring and pass hard on the left.\u00a0",
            " \"be aware of me, because I'm not sure you are\" \n\nIt's not what this \"used to be\", it's exactly what it is for. Don't overthink it. \n\nYou may think you'll always look over your shoulder, but a lot of people don't.  One misstep at the wrong time can cause an injury.",
            "Don't overthink it, just follow the rules consistently..",
            "Yes, as someone who is usually walking with small children, please ring. Kids are maniacs, and it might take a second to make sure they don't randomly run in front of you",
            "id rather get fully off the path than leave my fate up to the cycling skills of a rando tbh",
            "The thing I hate most about this is it  is only done just as they are about to pass you 100 msec later.  \"On your left\" usually literally means \"I'm on your left RIGHT NOW\". \n\nIt needs to be done earlier to give the person time to hear and respond positively.  Frankly, unless you are literally shouting, you can't do this far enough back for it to be effective.\n\nUse a bell.  Get a good one.",
            "Food for thought: when cycling, I will ring my bell about 8ft out from a pedestrian but if that person is still unaware (and usually engrossed in their phone, talking energetically with their hands\u2026) that I am approaching them, I will loudly say \u201con your left\u201d about 3-4ft away. They usually get startled but at least we are aware of each other.",
            "I\u2019ve been commuting by bike in Ottawa for nearly 3 years now and have NEVER had anyone jump out in front of me after ringing my bell. Are you ringing fat enough behind (I\u2019d say at least 20 feet) and far to the left? Or right before passing?",
            "I do find my loud free hub to actually get more attention. One of the funnier (and almost bad) ones was I rode up behind a couple riding side by side on the TCT who were chatting. I rang about 3 times on the approach; it was uphill so I wasn\u2019t so inclined to freewheel. Finally I politely said \u201cexcuse me\u201d and one of them startled so bad they almost crashed lol.",
            "It sounds like you\u2019re not ringing your bell when you\u2019re far enough away. People jump because you\u2019re right there already when you ring/call out.",
            "I listen to audiobooks on mine, and always here the bell through that. So I know I still appreciate the ring!",
            "Thank you for keeping it real.\n\nAs as cyclist, you can't win in this city.",
            "My bad...it was the beer talking...yup passing on LEFT!!!",
            "Haha nice catch. I wrote left first, and then \"corrected\" myself.\u00a0\n\n\nI have math dyslexia, and orientations aren't my strong point. \ud83d\ude05",
            "\n>You pass on the right?!\n\n\n\nI did today on the grass on the bypass around the Westborough Beach closure. The guy in front was riding slowly down the rough pavement instead of the grass.",
            "If you're keeping right then you're not in the way",
            "Sure, but when people ring when somebody's walking straight on the side of the path already it serves no purpose other than spooking the person.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Fair enough, better to be safe I guess. As a cyclist though, I don't really expect the majority of walkers to swerve jump into the centre of the path, so I find it kinda funny when a line of ten bikers all ring their bell when they pass me.",
            "And it scares the bejeezus out of you because it's like right in your ear instead of five metres back",
            "Same, sometimes people don\u2019t seem to clue in about the bell so I tell them as a backup",
            "If you have trouble sorting out right from left frequently, look up dyscalculia, it's kind of like number dyslexia and this is one of the ways it presents",
            "I don't have dyslexia and sometimes call out right \ud83d\udc4d",
            "The person on the bike doesn't know what you may do. You could step into their path or stick out your arm or something. It's to prevent an accident.",
            "Hey. Did I call you a name in my previous comment? No, I didn't. As a PEDESTRIAN, who does not even own a bike, I have accidentally hit someone passing too closely to me on the SIDEWALK. They are not supposed to be on the sidewalk, but they were anyway. If they had rang their bell, I would have heard them coming, and not moved into their path. You're the \"ding-bat\" for not realizing the purpose behind it. Who the fuck cares if it startles you?",
            "[deleted]",
            "Dogs and kids are unpredictable. I avoid taking little ones on shared paths - it\u2019s too dangerous."
