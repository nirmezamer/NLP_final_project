My personal time, I fill that with things I enjoy doing - in my case reading, 3d printing stuff, painting warhammer models, watching TV and listening to music, pretty much all of which I can multitask on.        \n\nWork is necessary to cultivate personal responsibility and avoid stagnation just as hobbies are. None of us live in a vacuum.  We all should contribute. Your hobbies are your choice, if you don't find them fulfilling then try doing something else instead. Life is a balance between. Having a hobby that just passes the time is fine. It's allowed. It's ok. A steady guaranteed 80% fulfilment is better than chasing 100% fulfilment and failing. Perfect is the enemy of good. Good enough is good enough.         \n\n'Personal growth'... is that required in life? I'd say no after a point. Find something you like doing and do it, ignore everything else, enjoy what you can while you can, try a new thing here and there but you can always go back to the old thing. If you don't 'grow' beyond that then who gives a toss? Time spent worrying about if your personal time is offering enough 'personal growth' doesn't sound enjoyable or fulfilling to me tbh.

            ">...working so that the top .01% can pretend to live in heaven on earth\n\nConsider reframing how you think about work. *(edit: This is all the royal 'you' not previous commenter specifically)*\n\nFocusing too much on what others have and you don't can lead to jealousy and resentment which aren't of much use. I'm not dismissing current issues, but be careful how you waste your time. And we all waste time, just waste it on stuff that can improve your lived experience.\n\nIn my mind, I mostly live better than kings and presidents did as recent as 100 years ago. I'm free from diseases like polio, have an air conditioned home, have a reliable truck (also with AC), a refrigerator filled with fresh food anytime of the year. And on and on...\n\nYea, I'm not living as well as the kings of today, but things are dramatically better for me than most humans have ever experienced for thousands of years.\n\nImagine if you had to personally solve for all of your needs. You'd spend practically all of your time trying to raise animals and grow plants just to have food. You'd spend the rest of your time securing clean water, maintaining shelter and maybe warding off others who want to take your stuff.\n\nJob specialization has freed us from so many tasks and allowed us to focus on developing things like math, science, inventions, and more. Things like free time, entertainment, *weekends*, and *holidays* could barely exist otherwise.\n\nSo many people today have it better than almost any human in history, yet allow themselves to believe life is crummy because of what that other dude has over there.
