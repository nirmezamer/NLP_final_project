        "content": "I found out a couple weeks ago that some friends are pregnant with their first. I wrote this to help them prepare for it. FWIW, I have an almost 3 year old and a 4.5 month old. I hope this helps some dads to be, here!\n\nFeel free to add anything you think I missed (there are things I thought of after I emailed this to my buddy and told him later but did not put into this).  After we've got some responses, I'll see how much of this we can add to the wiki here.\n\n**Before**\n\n* Go to all baby appointments!\u00a0 This is probably a no brainer for you but some people don't realize it.\u00a0 Ultrasounds are cool!\u00a0 And it's really great to ask the ObGyn or midwife any and all questions you have!\u00a0 (ie, I asked before #1 was born when I'd be able to hear his hearbeat.\u00a0 The ObGyn said, \"in just a minute, I have the doppler right here.\"\u00a0 \"no, I mean with my ear against her belly.\" \"oh, never, it's too loud in there and baby's heartbeat gets drowned out.\")\n* Go to some birth classes.\u00a0 But maybe not all of them.\u00a0 Depends how many you're encouraged to go to; KP advised ALL of them and they're tiring and tedious and mostly boring. I skipped the breastfeeding one, from the sounds of it, that was a good choice because it was a bunch of women trying to learn to breast feed dolls with at least one boob hanging out.\u00a0 L&D class was like 8 hours on a Saturday with like 30 couples.\u00a0 We went through the whole process.\u00a0 It was exhausting.\u00a0 I'm not sure it helped much because when you get to it, you listen to what the medical team is advising.\n* Start planing to buy shit now (or starting at week 13)\u00a0 If you're going to do one, make a registry, do the showers, and see what people get you.\u00a0 Get your big ticket items (car seats, strollers, cribs, etc) onto something like camelcamelcamel or other pricewatch and buy the sales.\u00a0 I bought our stroller as an OpenBox deal on Amazon.\u00a0 Still paid $300 for it but that's better than the $500 retail.\u00a0 More on gear later.\n* If you're going to get a doula, start meeting them now and find someone you like.\u00a0 My yoga studio has a \"meet the doulas\" event one night every month or so where they all give a spiel and then you can hang out and talk to them.\u00a0 We went but I had to chase our toddler around so I didn't get to sit in on the thing.\u00a0 We found a doula to be really helpful, mostly because it made it feel like there was a person on our team that wasn't a hospital employee and it gave me more comfort in being able to leave the room to run home for things as needed.\u00a0 In retrospect, a doula would have been probably even better with the first delivery than the second but live and learn.\n* Pregnancy sucks.\u00a0 Did no one tell you that?\u00a0 Plenty of women say they loved being pregnant (Wife said she enjoyed being pregnant with our first, not so much the second as she had miserable heartburn every day.\u00a0 She carried a bag of tums with her at all times and called them her \"after dinner mints\".) and I have no doubt some do.\u00a0 I support that and their feelings.\u00a0 But you're beginning what will likely be one of or the most life changing choice you'll ever make and prior to that little bundle of giggles popping out, your partner gets to go through a roller coaster of hormones (I lucked out with wife, she's even keeled and that part wasn't bad) as well as body changes that are sure to wreak havoc on psyche.\u00a0 \"I'm the heaviest I've ever been!\"\u00a0 Well, yea, you've got a baby inside you, you've never had a baby inside you before.\u00a0 Really messed with wife when I put my boot on the scale at a visit and tipped the scales to something like 190.\u00a0 She was like \"OMG, I've really packed it on in these weeks!\"\u00a0 The med assistant gave me wry smile and wife turned to see me close and scrunched her nose and shook a fist.\u00a0 Fun stuff.\n* Did I say pregnancy sucks?\u00a0 Libido will be all over the place.\u00a0 So will body comfort both physically and mentally.\u00a0 You just roll with it as you can.\u00a0 Near the end (and especially once the baby has come) your partner's breasts will probably be the largest, shapeliest, and most enticing they have ever been.\u00a0 And it may be entirely likely you're are not allowed to play with them, touch them, look at them, breath on them, or even think about them because they're sore and maybe leaking, and goddamnit I'm a cow now, MOOO.\u00a0 (Wife has said moo a couple times in the last couple weeks when I walk in and she's pumping; I think all the pumping is taking a toll on us both.\u00a0 It's a lot more work that breastfeeding but it allows me a wonderful amount of involvement with the baby which allows for more bonding and I feel way more connected to #2 than I did our first at this age).\n* Of course, the above are not absolutes, all women are different and pregnancies are different.\u00a0 We had plenty of sexy time while pregnant with #1 and comparatively none with #2.\u00a0 Part of that was how hard the second pregnancy was and part of that was that we already had a kid and were doing parent things so were tired.\u00a0 So it goes.\n* Plan some vacation now; especially if leave from work is not a concern.\u00a0 First trimester can be rough but things generally smooth out in the second.\u00a0 We went to Nicaragua and hiked an active volcano when wife was 4 months preg with #1.\u00a0 Do that shit now, it will be a while until you'll want (or have the energy) to travel and we're a lot less adventurous now that we're caring for kid and infant.\u00a0 No surprise there\n* Start familiarizing yourself with the alphabet soup.\u00a0 FMLA, CFRA, PFL, SDL.\u00a0 Family Medical Leave Act; California Family Rights Act; Paid Family Leave; Short Term Disability Leave.\u00a0 These will require paperwork from medical offices to employers and to the state.\u00a0 Get these submitted as required and make use of those benefits.\u00a0 You can always do more work.\u00a0 One day your baby is crying for you and wants to be held and snuggled, the next he's telling you to get out of the chicken run, you don't go in there, and he'll put you in timeout.\u00a0 It's fucking hard but not so that you'd want to miss it.\n* Know your employment contract/policies/etc as well as your boss's position on family life and work culture.\u00a0 Don't be guilted into anything that is less than the full amount you are entitled to.\u00a0\u00a0\n* In the same vein as the above point, you won't believe (maybe you will) the amount of assholes who will tell you, \"you won't be able to wait to get back to work!\" or \"why are you taking so much time?\" or \"You'll get sick of being home and come back early.\"\u00a0 No two ways about this: fuck those people.\n* Know multiple routes to your hospital and how long it take to get there in the worst traffic.\u00a0 First babies are generally slow to come but it's a goddamn roller coaster of excitement when something like water breaking happens and you have to get up and go.\n\n**Labor and Delivery**\n\n* By now you should have a car seat base installed into the car and a proper car seat in it, waiting for the moment.\u00a0 Leave this in the car, the hospital will likely not let you leave without it.\u00a0 Find a place to inspect the installation; some hospitals do it, so do fire departments.\u00a0 Google/call around or ask at your next ObGyn visit.\n* You need a Go Bag.\u00a0 Or one each.\u00a0 This should include:  \n\n   * personal care products\n   * phone chargers\n   * other distraction things (labor can be literally hours of just sitting waiting)\n   * list of mom's meds (or mental knowledge)\n   * known allergies!\n   * birth plan if you have one\n   * a change of clothes (as a dirty man, I think I brought a shirt, lol)\n   * clothes for baby to go home in (don't just bring NB size!\u00a0 A 0-3 onesie is a good idea too; never know how big that baby is going to be)\n   * lacrosse ball or whatever; hospital room accommodation for mom is alright, Dad is probably going to be on a pull out chair or couch.\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Comfortable, easy on/off, loose clothes for mom.\u00a0\n* You'll mostly be told what/where/how to do things once you're in the hospital.\u00a0 However, you have some choice too.\u00a0 Mom doesn't have to labor laying down on her back with her feet in stirrups.\u00a0 You can walk around, (depending on facility) use a bath tub, roll onto sides, hands and knees, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Pain management is important.\u00a0 Something I think helped with #2 is that instead of going straight for an epidural, wife elected for Nitrous Oxide.\u00a0 So as she felt a contraction coming, she'd hold the cup over her face and breath the N2O until about the peak of the contraction.\u00a0 Obviously not enough to knock her out but enough to take some of the edge off the contraction.\u00a0 (Apparently, this used to be really common, then much less so since the 80s? 90s? then has come back into favor after new research more recently.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Epidural is an option.\u00a0 Talk to your ObGyn about this.\u00a0 TL;NotAHealthCareProvider is it numbs things drastically and therefore often requires IV synthetic oxytocin to be administered to advance the labor.\u00a0 More interferey, more possibility for complicationy.\n* You'll likely be offered to cut the cord.\u00a0 I noped the fuck out of cutting #1's.\u00a0 When they asked me way before #2 came out, I said \"no way\".\u00a0 But when the time came I spoke up and told them I wanted to.\u00a0 I don't really remember it honestly.\u00a0 I mean, I do, but it isn't that significant in my mind.\u00a0 I'd recommend doing it, though.\n* AFAIK, episiotomies are no longer recommended but that isn't to say tearing won't happen.\u00a0 It probably will.\u00a0 It will have to be stitched up.\u00a0 It comes in four grades. Vaginal wall, vaginal muscle, rectal muscle, rectal wall.\u00a0 I don't remember the grading numbers, 1-4 I think.\u00a0 First kid caused a 3, second a 2.\u00a0 Recovery from the 2 was much faster than the 3.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Feeding the baby as soon and as much as possible is important.\u00a0 Gotta get that nasty poop (don't remember what it's called) out as it is related to jaundice problems.\u00a0 Jaundice is also apparently caused by a blood type (RH) mismatch, between mother and baby and we had this problem with #2.\u00a0 We spent like 24+ hours keeping him under blue lights and trying like hell to stuff his body full.\u00a0 Once he regained birthweight, all concerns related to the RH mismatch were gone and we were out of the dark.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Breastfeeding can be hard for mother and baby at first.\u00a0 Use lactation consultants and get help.\u00a0 Mom's who breast feed have a lower risk of post partum depression\n* Dads can get post partum depression too.\u00a0 Maybe google around and be aware of the risk factors and signs for both of you.\n\n**Gear**\n\n* Car seats all have to meet the same safety standards.\u00a0 Get one that is light enough to be comfortable, is easy to get in and out, and fits in your car well.\u00a0 That last bit is more important for older kid carseats than infant because infant seats all seem to have the same base size.\n* Crib: they're fucking expensive.\u00a0 We got ours from Pottery Barn, somewhere we would never shop, only because one of wife's friend's moms gave us $200 in gift cards for there for our wedding.\u00a0 I think we still paid like $400 for the crib after the cards applied.\u00a0 But #2 is using it now too so maybe that's not insane.\n* Stroller, as mentioned above, it's expensive.\u00a0 We had a Graco or something that we bought because it would hold the infant seat and it was cheap.\u00a0 It fucking sucked and I hated walking/running with it and it didn't maneuver well. Then we went on a hike and borrowed a BOB.\u00a0 It's a great stroller.\u00a0 We bought our own.\u00a0 #1 still rides in it on evening walks while we carry his brother on our chest.\u00a0 And this weekend we snapped the adapter into it and put #2's car seat on it and went to the Farmer's Market.\u00a0 Again, if you're comfy with the idea, Amazon Warehouse/Open Box deals.\u00a0 I wanted a stroller with a swiveling front wheel that had the option to lock as well as an adjustable handle.\u00a0 I found the handle on our old stroller was too low and was uncomfortable for long periods of pushing.\u00a0 The adjustable height on the BOB handle is nice.\u00a0 I think the biggest thing here is to get a stroller that fits your lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0\n* A\u00a0[baby swing](https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/category/gear-travel/infant-activity/swings/32026/)\u00a0is handy.\u00a0 It's nice to have something that rocks them and plays music/white noise.\u00a0 We've got one that has a mobile as well.\u00a0 Given the time frame, I think you guys are welcome to ours.\u00a0 It's a little squeaky but wholly functional.\n* A bouncing chair gets even more use, for us, with both kids.\u00a0 We have one\u00a0[like this](https://m.bedbathandbeyond.com/m/product/fisher-price-reg-sweet-snugapuppy-dreams-bouncer/1060769749?skuId=60769749&mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand_baby_online&product_id=60769749&adtype=pla&product_channel=online&adpos=1o53&creative=224186171444&device=m&matchtype=&network=g&mrkgadid=3176331679&mrkgcl=609&rkg_id=h-0d17d1bd656a886269a47241e10a5375_t-1530800094&gclid=CjwKCAjwg_fZBRAoEiwAppvp-fNHgwAfAmULKYGimNi-JF0XnrWq7rOiZsbO0bsCGJe9prDy0R1CXhoCcj4QAvD_BwE).\u00a0 It worked really well for both kids and we use it ALL the time.\u00a0 Several times/day.\n* Water proof mattress covers.\u00a0 covers, with an 's'.\u00a0 Because you want two of them.\u00a0 Make the crib twice: cover, sheet, cover, sheet.\u00a0 That way when the inevitable 2am blowout happens, you strip down the first two layers quick and go back to sleep.\u00a0 We changed and replaced too many sheets with #1 before we learned this one.\n* A baby carrier.\u00a0 Ayayay.\u00a0 We've had like 4 of these things.\u00a0 Bjorn (meh); Baby Onya (used a lot but was never very comfortable for either of us); one other I can't remember, and now a Lille Baby which we both like and find very comfortable.\u00a0 Wife also got a Ribozo from our doula.\u00a0 It's a 15' long wrap.\u00a0 It works well for wife and #2 looks so cozy in it.\u00a0 Generally she uses that and I use the Lille but she sometimes uses the Lille.\u00a0 I haven't tried the Ribozo yet but don't think I will.\n* Bottles.\u00a0 Holy crap there are so many.\u00a0 With #1 we ended up liking Tommee Tippee the best but #2 had trouble with them.\u00a0 We went to Dr. Brown's for him.\u00a0 They're expensive but seem to really help cutting down the sucked air.\u00a0 (getting him off formula really helped get rid of his fussiness too).\u00a0\u00a0 If breastfeeding, this isn't really a concern\n* A bottle warmer.\u00a0 In both our condo and here in our house, we leave a bottle warmer near the bed.\u00a0 At night we put a cooler with bottles next to the bed and warm them as needed throughout the night.\u00a0 It's basically a small hot plate that you add water to and it boils/steams the bottles.\u00a0 Works alright.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Big swaddles.\u00a0 Not these stupid like 18-24\"x 30\" buggers that are everywhere.\u00a0 We got some this time around that are like 36x36\" and they work way better.\n\n**Baby Care**  \nYou're going to want some things on hand so that you don't have to go get them at the 24hour CVS at 2am.\u00a0 I've done this.\u00a0 On multiple occasions (once from a hotel room in an hour or so south of Sacramento because we didn't bring things with us; it sucked)\n\n* Tylenol.\u00a0 Children's tylenol has the same concentration as baby tylenol but is generally (no exaggeration) less total cost for twice the volume.\u00a0 Often the difference is the cap--baby tylenol has a cap that receives a syringe, children's often doesn't.\u00a0 So decant into the lid or a dosage cup and draw it with the syringe.\u00a0 \"But children's tylenol doesn't come with a syringe?!\"\u00a0 Go to the pharmacy window and ask for a liquid medicine dosing syringe.\u00a0 They have them for free.\u00a0 The thing to make sure is that the tylenol is 160mg/5ml.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Ibuprofen.\u00a0 Kids can't have this until 6 months.\u00a0 At which point, get some and keep it on hand so you can cycle Tylenol/IB as needed.\n* Baby gas drops.\u00a0 The drug is Simethicone.\u00a0 Get a couple bottles and keep on hand.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Gripe water.\u00a0 It is natural gas remedy and supposed to help sooth the tummy.\u00a0 It's like fennel or some other herbacious shit.\u00a0\u00a0\n* thermometer.\u00a0 We've got rectal, oral, and one that goes into ear.\u00a0 The first two have gotten lots of use.\u00a0 The aural, not much; wiggly kids are tough. Don't confuse which one goes in what hole.\n* We recently bought an otoscope so we can see if it's worthwhile to head to the Ped/urgent care for ear problems.\u00a0 I think it was like $40 on Amazon; comparing that to copays, it seemed reasonable.\n* Lanolin.\u00a0 For diaper rash (also chapped nipples).\u00a0 There are other options for diaper rash too.\u00a0 Lanolin seemed to do the best job with the least disgustingness.\u00a0 Coconut oil is nice for general use as well but not great for severe rash.\n* Baking soda.\u00a0 This isn't a carry with everywhere thing, it's more for dealing with diaper rash at home.\u00a0 But a good amount into a bath really seems to soothe skin.\u00a0 I just dump a bunch in.\u00a0 If you get it from somewhere other than the grocery store it's super cheap.\n* Q-tips for boogers and ear wax\n* Put your pediatrician's number into both your phones under something like \"PEDIATRICIAN\" so it's easy to find.\n* to couple with above, most places (especially down there) or insurance providers have an \"advice nurse\" who is a great, free resource to call with questions.\u00a0 It's kind of like triage in that they can help you decide if the kid needs to be seen by medical providers.\u00a0 Put this number into your phone too.\n\n**Baby at home**\n\n* Sleep when the baby sleeps\n* Read about sleep training and decide what you're going to do.\u00a0 It doesn't have to be concrete, but it helps to have a plan and start early.\n* Co sleeping is done around the world but largely frowned on in America.\u00a0 New research is suggesting maybe America rethink that (saw that headline yesterday, I think).\u00a0 Do what's right for you.\u00a0 Generally, our babies slept better with us when young but we slept like shit with them in bed.\u00a0 We normally only brought them to bed when they needed comfort.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Happiest Baby on the Block is a book or video or something that gets rave reviews.\u00a0 We watched the dude who created it in a KP class on infant care.\u00a0 Swaddling and \"shhh-ing\" really calm an angry baby.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Youtube some swaddling techniques.\u00a0 There's kind of a standard version and a \"frog\" version.\u00a0 I only did the frog version with #1 a little bit near the end of his swaddling but it worked well.\u00a0 I use the standard (draw a straight edge of cloth--I use stretchy blanket, often--across the baby, right shoulder to left hip; draw the excess from below them up tight to the left shoulder; draw the remainder tight from left shoulder to right shoulder.\u00a0 Bam.\u00a0 Swaddled and happy\n* White noise machines are recommended frequently to help kids sleep.\u00a0 We play little musics when he's in his chair or swing and have\u00a0[one of these for the crib](https://www.amazon.com/New-Baby-Einstein-Dreams-Soother/dp/B01JVSYFTS/ref=sr_1_11_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1527822347&sr=8-11&keywords=baby+einstein+under+the+sea)\u00a0but #2 doesn't seem to be into it whereas #1 would zone out on it and pass out.\n* Reflux is a common issue with baby because they're lower esophogeal valve doesn't work like ours.\u00a0 It's also the reason they vomit when burping, I think.\u00a0 A folded tower underneath the own end of the crib mattress can really help to ease some fussiness if this is an issue.\n* Gas pain is really common especially with bottle fed and formula babies and with all babies until the gut develops more (4+ months, I think).\u00a0 laying them on their back and \"bicycling\" their legs can be helpful, so can pushing but legs up to a squatty position when they are on the back.\u00a0 Once they're a bit older and can hold head up, laying them across the lap with hips hanging off one side and head off the other can be beneficial as well.\n* People will want to touch your baby the same way they want to touch your dog--without asking.\u00a0 Think about how you want to handle this.\n* the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends basically 0 screen time until 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0\n* If the kid won't stop screaming and you've done everything and are losing your shit, put it down in it's crib and take a breather.\u00a0 It is safe in it's crib and you'll feel both a million times better and like an asshole for having been frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Learn Infant, Child, and pregnant woman heimlich and CPR if you don't know it already\n* Lock the poisons away now.\n* Schedule time to give your partner a break and do the same for yourself.\u00a0 This is \"me\" time.\u00a0 A walk around the neighborhood, watching the ocean, circus time, a cup of coffee, walking through the shops downtown.\u00a0 Whatever.\u00a0 Just make plans to send one another away alone.\u00a0 You don't realize how much you worry about the kids until you're not with them.\u00a0 You'll hear a baby while out and go into high alarm then realize, \"oh, that's not mine.\"\n* Find a good baby sitter and plan dates.\u00a0 Between date expenses and the sitter it's fucking expensive.\u00a0 It's worth it.\u00a0\n* Read to your kid every night.\u00a0 We haven't started with #2 consistently yet but will soon.\u00a0 #1 gets his books every night.\u00a0 It's a wonderful time to expand their vocabulary, teach them, and also cuddle, bond, and relax.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI think more than anything, trust yourselves and your instincts.\u00a0 All manner of things are said to make your life and baby easier, happier, healthier, smarter, etc.\u00a0 Most are just to make money for other people.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "I hate to post something negative on such a well thought out, super informational and positive post but I have to. Please do not co sleep with your new born. In the last 10 years two babies at my wife's family church have died because of this. They are so tiny and weak they can't wake you up if they slip between you. A family lost their infant 7 months ago because the dad fell asleep with the infant on the couch. When he woke up 2 hours later the baby wass between him and the cushion and not breathing. At least wait until they are able to roll over and have the strength to wake you up if being suffocated. \n\nEdit 5 years later: BY CO SLEEP I MEANT SHARE A BED, or TAKE A NAP ON THE COUCH HOLDING YOUR INFANT. IM NOT SAYING IF YOUR BABY SLEEPS IN A BASSINET IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU IS WRONG. I GAVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES IN MY POST AND ALMOST WEEKLY FOR FIVE YEARS SOMEONE COMMENTS TO ARGUE",
            "At the bottom of this list:  \nYou won't do half of these things, or you won't do them right, and you'll feel like a failure. You're not. Just keep going. You'll be fine.",

            "This is what I came to the sub looking for. Take the critiques in stride - you posted in good faith, and everyone should know their mileage will vary. My wife and I are expecting number one this winter, and this gives me a nice springboard for research. I appreciate your writing it.",
            "DEMAND TO BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING YOUR CHILD.\n\nIt seems like society is so geared toward women raising children that everyone assumes the Mother will do everything on her own with zero assistance from the Father. I understand that unfortunately in many cases pregnancy occurs outside of marriage and the father completely abandons mom & child, but caretakers and doctors actively ignore fathers at this point, at least in my experience here in America.\n\nI want to be as involved with my son as I can. I also want to alleviate some burden on my wife from being the Forever Mom (always being the one to have to remember everything by herself - child's schedule, doctor/medical issues, every item that needs to be brought to school, etc). My son's daycare/school admins, doctors, and anyone communicating information about my son will only tell my wife. I'm completely in the dark about some things because no one tells me. My wife can't keep track (nor should she have to) of what I know and don't know.\n\nMy son has been to three daycare/preschool facilities and none have sent me a single email once. I've asked questions to the doctor during a checkup and they turned to my wife and told the answer directly to her, ignoring me.\n\nIt's not like I'm shady looking guy and they have something they're judging me on, as far as I can tell. People just assume that fathers are not in their kids lives or that only mom needs to know.",
            "My 2p. \n\nEveryone will offer advice whether you want it or not. They'd do it this way, well your mother did it that way etc. You don't need to listen to any of it!\nIf you're keeping your child healthy and happy and you and your partner are doing OK, then you're on a winner! Everyone is different, go with what works for you. Especially in those zombified first few months, it's about getting through the day in one piece - if the baby is thriving, you're doing great! It's important that new parents think about themselves too. \n\nAnother thing few people will tell you - there will be times when you're on the brink of hating the tiny screaming thing that's kept you awake for days in end. You will likely find yourself thinking you can understand why people shake babies to shut them up (obviously, please, please don't).  Naturally you would never do anything to harm your wee child, but the thought that you might ever feel that way horrifies you. \nTHIS IS NORMAL. You're at your wits' end, you're likely sleep deprived, you don't know what the hell to do next, all you want is some peace. You're not a bad parent for feeling like this, you're not a horrible person, you're under a tremendous amount of unaccustomed stress. Please don't beat yourself up over feeling like that occasionally. \n\n",

Fathers can become depressed after their child is born.  It happened to me, and really put a strain on my relationship with my son and my wife.  Thankfully, things are better than ever for me now, because I got the help I needed.\n\nIf you or your wife/S.O./whoever start to notice anything strange about your behavior, do what's right and get help.

            "My biggest piece of advice 11 months into being a dad comes from the first week of being a dad. When you get home from the hospital, you'll have visitors upon visitors. Without being rude, put them to work. They won't want to stay as long. Don't be rude about it. Be subtle. And be prepared to tell the same stories over and over again. It will take until about the second week when you get to just bond as your little family. I wished I could have put everyone off for a week. But, my daughter turned out great. Love her so much and it makes me love her mom even more. ",

            "This is great! A few points, I'd like to add: 1. don't put q-tips into the baby's (or your own) ears or nose, you could cause damage very easily. Use a snot or wax sucker or just a tissue or facecloth. 2. cribs don't have to be expensive. We got one from ikea for $130 and the matress for $90. It fits regular crib sheets and will certainly meet the safety standards in your country. It's simple, but nice looking and will turn to a toddler bed down the road (like most others). I believe walmart has similar priced options also. 3. Such a good call on the stroller comments! My mum is tall so she warned us about handles that are too low. If you are concerned about this (or even if you aren't), find a store with a selection of strollers on display and both parents should try them out to find one that you like. It's a bit like buying a car. Don't feel like you have to buy that stroller from that store, go find a deal somewhere else or price match, if you can. Luckily, there are no car salespeople at the stroller store. ;) 4. If you have a dishwasher, aim to get dishes/bottles/breast pumps/etc that are dishwasher safe, when possible. Doing dishes sucks, let the machine do it, while you cuddle your baby, or your baby mama. 5. Baby stuff goes on sale ALL THE TIME. If you can wait, there will be another sale soon. My country still has toys r us, and they have a babyfest sale at least 3 times per year. 6. If you want to save money, find a consignment store, or buy on kijiji, garage sale, or whatever you prefer. We got all that ridiculous gear, that doesn't last long, second hand for almost nothing. Example, exersaucers cost like $150+, I bought one from facebook for $15 and gave it a good cleaning. When you're done with it, pass it on to a friend or sell it back to someone else and we all win! Did the same with lots of baby clothes and cloth diapers too. SO much money saved!",

            "I was going to add my own post, but I'd like to expand on some of your amazing tips based on my experience:\n- Birth classes are important to realize when you should make a choice vs blindly listening to the doctor. Doctors will follow a checklist and try to have your best interest in mind, but those checklists are also there to ensure the least chance of being sued. Also, when things get harder (not bad, just hard), knowing what's going on is helpful. I had to choose between vacuuming or not with the second one, which was always not recommended at birth classes, but they explained to me what it was and I saw how exhausted my wife was. I'm glad I did because when I said \"let's do it\" I didn't realize there were like 10 doctors in the room ready for emergency C-section\n- Breastfeeding classes seems less important from a dad perspective, but this is an incorrect assumption. I'm pulling out some vague memory where 50% of women in western world have under-diagnosed breastfeeding problems. When figuring out how to breastfeed, having both parents have training does help. Yes at some point your knowledge will be useless and forgotten, but breastfeeding is hard until baby's neck is stronger and it can **greatly affect your partner**. Chat with a lactation consultant if you can, they will train you. The mantra of ours was \"breastfeeding SHOULD NOT HURT\". I've met many, many, many medical professionals that dismissed pain with \"it's normal, endure it and will go away in a few days\". Turns out my baby had problems with that, my wife was unable to breastfeed at day 3 because of the pain and I'm **so glad that I went to the breastfeeding classes** and met that lactation consultant. She was here on day 3, I brought a breastpump at home by that same day and even though what happened next was rough and painful (emotionally, not physically), our daughter happily breastfed until she was ~2 years old\n- Study a lot before birth, there is no time afterward\n- After birth, around month 2 or 3, everything seems very smooth and we had a lot of free time. Sadly this won't last that long. Around month 8 things get very busy and won't free up until school. Sorry, harsh reality check\n- There are no interesting tv shows without violence, sex or a combination of those\n- The GO BAG for birth needs to be **close to the door**\n- The GO BAG needs to have everything needed inside immediately and it should have the clothes you want to wear on top of the bag. AKA you need to be able to grab your go bag when you are brain-dead, because babies like to come at 4 am right during your REM-phase\n- If you or your partner wear glasses, try to have a duplicate inside the GO-bag, there might be **no time to grab things** (that doesn't imply you have to rush to the hospital, but your partner might need 90% of you to go through birth phases)\n- Babies do need moms. I was helping with feeding (pump + finger feeding), but at some point we traced back a few things to the lack of contact with mom. Ensure baby spend a lot of time in physical contact with mom and allow them to do more of the feeding, we are \"mammals\" after all\n- Being close to your spouse while breastfeeding is actually amazing, no need to be the one holding the breast to enjoy it\n- Plan for a lot of ready food for the first 2-weeks. Maybe 4, the first month is the hardest\n- Let the baby sleep wherever it sleeps. In our case, that was on ourselves for almost 9 months\n- Western culture has put an enormous cross on sleeping with kids, we were lucky to be exposed to many other cultures throughout our birth classes and realized how different this is. Yeah, there is danger of rolling over your kid when sleeping, what's not mentioned is that your body learns that there is a baby and won't do that over time. In general, stop treating it like a taboo, instead just consider it one of the available options. We went from sleeping 2 hours per-week (that is, 2 hours in total throughout the entire week, not 2 per day), to 8-10 hours per night (interrupted, but real sleep)\n- Sleeping with your kid is actually an incredibly bonding and rewarding experience, just ensure the whole sleeping environment is child safe (e.g. put the mattress on the ground, light blankets to prevent overheating, harder mattress and so on, ensure you are the kind of person that is conscious when rolling in bed or that doesn't move around)\n- No sleep is dangerous, yes you can fall asleep while standing and holding your kid\n- Yes you can sleep while standing inside a moving train\n- Having a car helps, but you are not required to have a car. We had 2 and used cabs both times. Yes you want to become good at installing the car seat fast **before the delivery date**. On the upside, you need the car seat only on the way back, when there is no hurry\n- Read books before baby is out, there is no time or will once they \"land\". There are a lot of good books for dads, for kids, for moms that even dads should read\n- A lot of studies in the medical field have poorly interpreted statistics, apparently. There is a book (I have to find the title) that was written by a mom specialized in statistics that went through a lot of those and discovered crazy things, like the reason you can't drink coffee during pregnancy was because the test was performed on animals by feeding them something like 75% of their body-mass as coffe. Yeah, you bed that's unhealthy\n- **This is going to be important** and I'm shocked no one told us until the second kid was coming: during labor, mom is filled with oxytocin that will help manage the pain for both herself and the baby. **With Epidural, your baby will have no pain relief**. We kept asking what are the downsides of an epidural and no one mentioned \"your baby will be in an enormous amount of pain during birth\"? Wow.\n- I was going to say: get a stroller, get a carrier, get a newborn carrier, get a car seat, but all of this differs per person. Crib was **completely useless** for us, the first kid slept in our bed, the second one, we added another bed (yes, room is full from wall to wall). The first one can now sleep in a normal bed, so the crib was completely useless. Also, newborn can sleep in a cardboard box (and it's actually considered safe), so you don't need a crib. Also, newborn will sleep way more where mom's smell is\n- Let mom wear a shirt for all day (and night), then when you put the baby down, flip the shirt and throw it on the baby. You'll get **way more free time**\n- If your partner uses a breast pump, make sure to get a steam sterilizer. Cuts down time wasted doing cleaning\n- More on breastpump, make sure to get one of those \"bras\" for your partner so that she doesn't need to hold the bottles. This way, she can eat/do stuff while pumping\n- Help feeding your partner (literally spooning) if her hands are busy due to breastfeeding-related tasks. It will feel weird, but it's actually good for the relationship and she will be glad\n- Remember that once the baby is out of the womb, you have way more data to perform hypothesis than doctors do. That means, if your instinct is telling you that your doctor is not digging enough into something, say that loud\n- Read the books about kids problems (2-3, 3+) and how to deal with them way early. They will come back and will be very helpful when the time comes and you have no time to actually read\n\n\nThis post is not a medical advice, please do your research, this is uniquely based on my personal experience!",

And more often than not, because people are far likelier to engage with content they disagree with (as opposed to 'liking' and moving on), you're going to be fed a lot of negative content about parenting in your feed.

            "You also don't need to spend $90 on a diaper bag with fancy insulated pockets and a wipe dispenser.  \n\nFor my little one, I got a back to school backpack from Wal-Mart for two whole dollars. Just bought a small lunch bag and ice packs for it. Huggies makes wipes dispensers. Now 3 years in, its got no holes rips or tears. That $90 bag will outlast how long your child needs bottles. \n\n**BONUS** It's bright yellow and covered in Pikachu. On several occasions I've asked someone to get the bag for me so I could change a diaper. You completely avoid the \"I can't find it in your car\" or the \"is this it?\" Makes it easier to find if it's left behind somewhere (like a restaurant) and you call in to ask the staff if it's there.\n\n\"Sweetheart, it's a backpack that's bright yellow and covered in Pikachu. Can't miss it.\"   \n\nJust save yourself the money from buying a special purpose bag, with all of the fancy pockets and holders. Spend that money on diapers, formula, anything else. A lot of expenses come up suddenly with having a child. New furniture, childproofing, baby bathroom stuff, bottles, clothes, etc. The last thing you should worry about is some fancy bag. I love this backpack. It only cost a few dollars. It's hard to lose because it's so bright and colorful. I got it off the clearance rack for TWO DOLLARS. Plus, since its a back to school backpack, you'll have a lot more choices for colors and desins. Rather than the diaper bags that imitate some designer bag. Say the cheap bag only lasts you a year? Back to school sales happen every year. Drop another few dollars and get a new one. You spend less money to turn a regular backpack into a diaper bag, than you'd spend on the bag itself if you get the special purpose one. \n\nIt's impossible not to notice it at the park, airport, restaurant, or wherever. So if you're in a crowded area, your spouse can find you easily just spotting the backpack. A cooler bag and ice packs for bottles and a changing mat is all you need to add.

I\u2019m proven wrong. This post is solid and thank you for a nice summary. I don\u2019t agree with everything, but this is some useful information. Probably won\u2019t hit a father-to-be the same as it hits someone whose already gone through some of this new stuff. \n\nWe have a 14 month old son. I\u2019d add to this list:\n\n- Bottle nipples. Know that nipples come in different flow rates for your baby as the baby gets older. If you find that your baby isn\u2019t feeding the same, likely agitated or maybe drinking less suddenly, it may be time to get a new nipple that allows more milk or formula to flow through. We found that our son got frustrated not being able to get enough from his bottle and it turned out that he was getting tired sucking formula through a nipple designed for babies a month younger than he was. We used Avent Natural Bottles and it\u2019s reviewed sometimes that the nipples would invert. I eventually figured out it wasn\u2019t a defect. It just meant that our son\u2019s sucking power was that much stronger that it was time again to get a faster flow nipple.\n\n- Get a rotary nail filer for babies. It scared me to think I would need to clip our baby\u2019s nails, but one of those prenatal classes advised us to get these little motorized rotary nail filers from Amazon. It\u2019s awesome and fool proof.\n\n- Learn how to suck snot. We used the bulb syringe for a day before tossing it out. Hospital said they were one time use because they can\u2019t be cleaned. Bought one from Amazon that you could take apart and wash, but I found that to be too weak. Nose Frida seemed kinda nasty, but I started looking into it more closely. Decided on a combination bulb and manual suction thing similar to Frida, except it was convertible into a bulb syringe. Awesome being able to control the power with my breath. I\u2019d give Nose Frida a try now, but the one we got is fine. However, on the fly, I learned to just suck snot with my mouth. Really useful if you are outdoors and can just suck and spit. Grandparents got an automatic battery operated nose aspirator. LOL. Weak sauce.",
            "That was a long post I admit it didn't read it all. A few things of advice my wife and I learned. It's not in order it's just coming off the too of my head.\n\n1. Buy as much formula and diapers ahead of time. You're going to use more than you think and a 2am trip to Walmart when you have to be up for work in 3 hours is not ideal.\n\n2. If the baby is crying and you can't handle it take a break and place the baby safely in the crib. The baby has been crying for hours another 2-3  minutes while you clear your head and make a cup of coffee isn't going to hurt, but it will when your past your breaking point and lose control. I've gone as far as asking my parents to watch my boys while I took a nap.\n\n3. If you get parental leave as a father take every last minute. Even unpaid if you can you will never get that time back to be with your significant other and newborn. The first two years of my oldest child's life I worked my face off to pay for the home were in now and I got videos of him rolling over, crawling, walking, his first words, etc. I missed all of that and I'll never get that time back. \n\nAlso your job as tiring as it is to tend to her every need. She carried that baby for a rough 10 months and went through incredible pain to give you a child. Take care of that baby and her until she's healed and back on her feet. \n\n4. Do all the things... first bath, first time meeting Santa, the expensive photos at Jcpenny, first time swimming, first time whatever.... take photos and lots of them and make sure you're both in them. We've learned looking back at old photos that one of us are always missing because we're taking the photo.\n\nI hope this helps. There's so much more and all 3 of my kids are different we had to learn each one. Good luck with your new child and welcome to the club! \ud83d\ude01",

            "Lurking mom here. This is a very good list. \n\nI\u2019d add:\n\n-Conflict between paternal grandma and new mom is really really common. Pregnancy groups have tons of posts about it. Sometimes it\u2019s the maternal grandmother, but conflict with paternal side is far more common. New mom\u2019s needs and wants come before grandma\u2019s wants. This includes medical privacy during pregnancy, who gets to be at the hospital and/or delivery room, who gets to be in your home postpartum and when, etc. There is no \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cequal\u201d in childbirth or postpartum delivery. Many new mothers naturally feel more comfortable with their own mother during these intimate and vulnerable times. Please put your wife\u2019s needs first, even if it creates an uncomfortable situation with your own mother. Set and manage expectations in advance.\n\nAn aside:\n\nI take issue with your well-intentioned point about breastfeeding reducing ppd. I\u2019d leave it out because it can cause undue pressure on mom. The data are flimsy because. It\u2019s a chicken or an egg situation . Is there a correlation between successful breastfeeding and reduced levels of ppd? Yes. What we don\u2019t know is whether those who stop breastfeeding early do so because they are predisposed to ppd. Correlation does not equal causation. Personally, I tortured myself trying to make breastfeeding work because I felt pressure to. It directly *contributed* to my ppd/ppa. As soon as I threw in the towel, my mental, emotional and physical health drastically improved. A lot of women struggle with this and are essentially gaslit about their experience.\n\nInstead, I\u2019d say learn what you can about the mechanics of breastfeeding and support her in whatever she chooses (including the right to change her mind).",

It can cause cramping and contractions due to a release of oxytocin. \n\nLearned to swaddle well enough that you can do it in your sleep\u2026because that\u2019s what might happen. \n\nAny fever in the first 4 weeks requires emergency room visit and spinal tap. So stay and home and don\u2019t let people kiss your baby. \n\nIf the baby is upset and you don\u2019t know why go down the list: food, diaper, comfort, cuddles. If it doesn\u2019t work. Do it again.

            "Here goes:  \n  \nBefore Baby Arrives\n\n1. Attend prenatal appointments together and ask questions. It's a great bonding experience.\n2. Start planning for essential baby gear early, and look for deals on big-ticket items.\n3. Prepare for the emotional and physical challenges of pregnancy. Be supportive and understanding.\n4. Take a trip or plan a \"babymoon\" while you can still travel easily.\n5. Familiarize yourself with your parental leave options and benefits.\n\nLabor and Delivery\n\n1. Have your hospital bag packed and ready, including a going-home outfit for the baby.\n2. Know your pain management options and discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n3. Be prepared for the possibility of tearing and stitches. It's common and will heal with time.\n4. Encourage early and frequent breastfeeding to help establish milk supply and reduce jaundice risk.\n5. Be aware of the signs of postpartum depression in both partners.\n\nBaby Gear Essentials\n\n1. Choose a car seat that is safe, easy to install, and fits your vehicle.\n2. Invest in a comfortable, versatile stroller that suits your lifestyle.\n3. Consider a baby carrier or wrap for hands-free bonding and convenience.\n4. Prepare the crib with waterproof mattress covers and extra sheets for quick changes.\n5. Have a variety of bottles and a bottle warmer on hand, even if breastfeeding.\n\nBaby Care Basics\n\n1. Stock up on essential medicines like infant Tylenol, gas drops, and diaper rash cream.\n2. Learn how to properly swaddle your baby for comfort and better sleep.\n3. Use white noise and gentle rocking to soothe your baby.\n4. Be prepared for reflux and gas issues, which are common in infants.\n5. Take infant CPR and first aid classes for peace of mind.\n\nAdjusting to Life with Baby\n\n1. Sleep when the baby sleeps, and don't be afraid to ask for help.\n2. Make time for self-care and \"me time\" for both partners.\n3. Plan date nights and find a trusted babysitter for occasional breaks.\n4. Read to your baby every day to promote bonding and language development.\n5. Trust your instincts and don't feel pressured to follow every piece of advice you receive.\n\nEvery baby is different; godspeed friend!",

If we\u2019ve had one drink, we can pick up the baby 2 hours later. \n\nI informed family over Christmas of this policy, that any drinking = can\u2019t hold baby.\n\nSome relatives have repeatedly tried to handle the baby after having a couple drinks. Sometimes innocently, like playing with his hands while he\u2019s on the floor, which is fine. Other times they\u2019ve tried to roll him over to do tummy time without me or mom in the room, and others have asked to have the baby be put in their lap and been awkwardly offended when I don\u2019t pass him. \n\nI\u2019m kind of a people pleaser and hate hurting people. In my mind, they\u2019ve all heard the policy and should be fully aware that by drinking it means they won\u2019t be holding the baby, and they all have time to hold the baby during the day when they\u2019re sober. \n\nI feel bad - am I the asshole? Am I being unreasonable? First time parent, idk. I don\u2019t expect the baby to die if he sits in the lap of someone who had two glasses of wine.

It doesn't make you or the mother any less good parents to ask for help, either from each other, or from others outside of your household. This can be physical assistance with baby care, a friend or family member to watch the baby for an hour while you gather your sanity, or even therapy.

            "I feel like this should be updated with some alternatives because a lot of things in here will either not work or be inapplicable. So, my two cents are:\n\nFirst and foremost, every pregnancy and baby will be different, what works for joe schmoe reddit user won't work for you, or it might, you won't know until it's time to try it. Most important is that you find what works for you and is safest/healthiest for your baby. You WILL get a TON, a METRIC FUCKING TON, of unsolicited advice from everyone and their mother's mother. Just smile, nod, maybe make a few mental notes and then find what works best for you, your partner, your home, your resources, and your baby. \n\nDo not buy a ton of shit before the baby comes, you are going to have to buy a ton of shit when the baby comes. Don't buy a ton of diapers, don't buy a ton of wipes, don't buy a ton bottles, don't buy a ton of nipples, don't buy a ton of things. Educate yourself on things you MAY NEED TO BUY. If someone buys a fucking ton of diapers for your baby shower, ask for a receipt. Every child will respond differently to different diapers, wipes, bottles, nipples, formula, etc etc etc, ours HATED huggies and loved pampers diapers, hated pampers wipes (caused diaper rash) and loved amazon wipes, hated the fancy nipples for bottles and loved the cheap ones, hated certain pacifiers and loved others. Buy the basic stuff you need before the baby comes, a crib, a carseat, and chair or couch for the room, a changing table, some sheets (don't forget the waterproof covers), a stroller, even a few things like booger suckers (buy an electric one, the bulb suckers are pretty garbage in comparison). You will probably get quite a few things in the hospital as well, fwiw. \n\nYour wife might be like mine during pregnancy, a 9 month hellscape of constant reflux, exhaustion, puking, getting up every 40 minutes to pee, pissing and shitting themselves, and not much in the way to help all that. Get unisom, get a shitload of unisom, get some nausea suckers, get a boatload of Tums chewables, and get ready to do whatever it takes to let her sleep and relax. Make dinners, do all the washing up, do laundry, take out the trash, do the vacuuming, clean the bathroom, don't be a bitch. Guess what, you got her pregnant, you don't get a free pass to fuck off for 9 months while she suffers. Pregnancy sucks for 99% of women, don't believe all the \"I loved being pregnant\" instagram videos you watch. \n\nSome quality of life things that make a big difference in the first few weeks: buy a bottle warmer, if you are breastfeeding have your wife pump a few bottles worth during the day (the doctors/nurses will recommend pumping every 15 minutes, it should be relatively easy to get 2+ extra bottles worth between baby feedings). The pumped milk is good for at least 3 days in the fridge, build up a stock pile (excess can be frozen in bags for months), storage bottles with adjustable lids that show the date/day pumped are super valuable. Then when you are up every 2 hours through the night you can just grab a bottle and throw it in the bottle warmer, give your partner a break, and power through those night feedings. You're both going to be exhausted, your wife is going to be dealing with PPD and a shitload of stress most likely, letting her sleep a few extra hours at night while you handle the night feedings will go a long ways. \n\nAsk friends/neighbors/family if they can pitch in with a meal delivery once a week for a few weeks, doesn't have to be anything fancy, hell we still talk about how one of or neighbors brought us some mediocre/horrible Olive Garden and it was the best thing ever. Not having to cook/prepare every meal or even really think about that kind of stuff for the first few weeks to a month is an amazing mental relief. \n\nA lot of people will tell you it's ok to just let things get messy, worry about it later. I'm of the opposite opinion, just get things done when you can, don't let dishes build into a frustrating mountain of mess over a day or two, don't let clothes pile up in the corner so you need 5 loads to get things washed. If you have 5-10 minutes of \"break\" time, wash stuff up, throw a load in, keep things relatively organized. Nothing is more frustrating than having a mountain of crap to clean after a couple days, when you are super fried, but you can't find a clean spoon to eat some cereal or a clean pair of underwear to put on. The first few months SUCK, but taking 10 minutes to do some washing up while your wife breastfeeds or bottle feeds can give some mental relief later on for BOTH of you, she won't bitch at you to help clean and she won't be stressed by a pile of stuff sitting around. Get your ass in the kitchen, do some damn work in the trenches, laundry isn't that hard, nobody cares if you get up at 5 am to go to work for 10 hours (been there, done that, get in line), your life is now about keeping little things together at home while you survive the first 6-12 months. \n\nGo to Walmart, go to the kids section, buy a shitload of the cheapest onesies you can. If it's summer then buy light ones with the snap bottoms that are easy to change, if it's winter buy onesies with zippers, ZIPPPPPEEEERRRRSSSS, zippers are so key for onesies with legs. Walmart onesies are like $5 or less, you don't need $20 onesies ever for any reason. Your kid is going to puke, shit, spit, drool, piss and make mess out of everything, you will probably go through 2-5 onesies in a day, just buy a bunch and don't even bother worrying about if they are \"boy\" or \"girl\" onesies, get the cheapest ones you can find and forget about it. Every 2-3 months you'll be buying more, bigger ones, for a long time. \n\nDon't co-sleep past 6 months, hell if you want to be a real trooper then get a cot for your baby room and take turns (BOTH of you) sleeping in the baby room for 6 months. At worst buy a bed-side sleeper so you or your wife don't even have to get out of bed to settle the baby. Co-sleeping past 6 months will only add stress and sleep deprivation for you both, probably won't help your baby sleep (although every baby is different), and prolong things that WILL happen (baby sleeping in their own room) to an age when they are more self aware and less confident. Get them in their own room, get them used to not needing you every 1-2 hours through the night, get them used to conditions that they will be in for the future. Sleep train if you have to, for your sanity getting them on a normal routine OUTSIDE your bedroom is huge. \n\nGood luck not giving your kid screen time in the first 12-24 months, in this day and age screens are EVERYWHERE, our kid was addicted to my wife's iwatch within 3-4 months. It's going to happen, try to limit it, get your kid outside for walks and exposure to real world things DAILY as a way to break it up. We live in a freezing cold area in the winter, bundle that little potato up and go for a walk in the winter, the baby will be fine. Outdoor exposure and public place exposure is HUGE for mental development, they will grow up in an age where digital consumption is a nearly all day everyday thing, don't fight it, supplement it with outdoors time EARLY EARLY EARLY. \n\nSpeaking of outdoors, if your kid is fair skinned with blue eyes get them sunglasses early, get them wearing sunglasses as early as you can so they are used to wearing sunglasses and won't take them off. Same with hats, also if you have a girl get them used to having their hair done (and undone) early. They are much less likely to fuss over these things than if you wait until they are 6, 9, 12 months old. \n\nLet the kid cry, don't pick it up the second it makes a sound, there will be times where you want to punch a wall because of how frustrating it is. As long as the kid is in a safe environment (their crib or playpen with NOTHING in it) they will be fine to cry for 5, 10 minutes. Go outside, scream at the sky, take a deep breath and realize things will get better eventually. A crying baby is an alive baby, there is NOTHING wrong with letting the kid wail while you take a breath. Your baby should not be held every second of every day, it needs to feel an environment free of you for times. It's totally normal to be freaked out about every hiccup, strained sound, and weird thing your kid does, but just relax and breathe. \n\nContinued in reply:",

            "> Pregnancy sucks.  Did no one tell you that?  \n\nYes and no. I remember my aunt being partially stuck in bed in the last month or so of one of her pregnancies. I've heard all the tales about morning sickness.\n\nNone of it prepared me for longevity of how long it lasts. I've spent YEARS on reddit, reading every gross story you can possibly imagine. Thousands of threads on TwoX, all of the \"Women of reddit, whats one thing men don't know\" types of threads that talk about period shits and all other kinds of disgusting parts of being a woman. I've heard people talk quite a bit about how miscarriage isn't discussed much despite how often it happens. I was prepared for the chances of a miscarriage and its emotional trauma. Well, as well as one can be prepared for such a thing. \n\nThe one thing I didn't hear about was that morning sickness isn't just in the morning. And it isn't just for a few weeks. I was surprised at the longevity of how long my wife had zero energy, could only eat oyster crackers, and left a puke bucket near the side of the bed. (side story one night she fell asleep I heard this THUNK and realized her kindle fell in the puke bucket, poor woman).\n\nThe thing about \"morning sickness\" is that it can range from non-existent to the entire pregnancy. 9 months of no energy and constant vomiting. I can't imagine how absolutely miserable that must be. Well OK maybe a little COVID really knocked me out but still. The thing about morning sickness is that it usually hits early on. And early on, most people don't share the news of being pregnant. If you're like my wife and I, we were extremely pragmatic about the chances of a miscarriage. So we didn't tell anyone for roughly the first 10-12 weeks.\n\nI'm sure all of _you guys_ know this being dads now but being sick for a month or two and not being able to really tell anyone why sucks. I felt so bad for my wife. Constant fatigue is one thing but fatigue and puking your guts out for months on end really shocked me. I was not prepared for that one.",

            "You should add liquid band-aid and baby safe Vaseline to the baby care list.  When my wife and I went to clip our sons nails for the first time we caught the very tip of the skin on his fingers.  Babies bleed a lot (proportionally) when they get a cut because their blood doesn't clot well early on but they do need their nails cut at some point because they can scratch their face when they rub their eyes and bleed that way if you don't (my son had this issue).  Normal sized band aids don't do well on baby fingers.  The baby will be upset and flailing and trying to get it off and it won't cover the tip of the finger well at all.  I had to think on the spot and came up with Vaseline to slow the bleeding and layering liquid band-aid on to stop it.  I had to pinch his finger to get the blood to slow enough to wipe it and put a thin layer of Vaseline on, then I painted on about 5 layers of liquid band-aid (letting it dry between) to make sure that the bleeding would stop and his finger would heal. Ideally if you can clip their nails while they sleep and double check to make sure you only have the nail in the baby clippers it should help you avoid catching the skin.  If you do have to deal with a cut then this combo works well.",

            "While you are absolutely correct, I want to add that the AAP updated their guidelines in 2016 to address cosleeping. The reason why they did that is important.\n\nIt's kind of unrealistic for a lot of parents to avoid cosleeping **at all times**. Parents (especially nursing mothers) do fall asleep with their newborns. There are also times when the baby will only sleep when comforted and that is often in the middle of the night, when the parent is also very sleepy.\n\nSo the new advice goes something like this: Avoid co-sleeping as much as possible. When you can't avoid it:\n\n> \"If you are feeding your baby and think that there's even the slightest possibility that you may fall asleep, feed your baby on your bed, rather than a sofa or cushioned chair,\" said Lori Feldman-Winter, MD, FAAP, member of the Task Force on SIDS and co-author of the report. \n\n> \"If you do fall asleep, as soon as you wake up be sure to move the baby to his or her own bed,\" she said.  \n\n> \"There should be no pillows, sheets, blankets or other items that could obstruct the infant's breathing or cause overheating.\"\n\nSo prepare your bed. Make sure it's firm and is free of pillows, sheets and blankets when you might fall asleep with the baby. Avoid when you can, take precautions before when you can't.",
            "I honestly have heard different from many midwives here in Canada.  They say you should NEVER co-sleep if you are obese, smoke, drink or do drugs, and Never have blankets above the knees, no loose pillows or sheets. However, if you are non of the above, Co-sleeping has been found to reduce the amount of SIDS in babies, and has other benefits. All I know is, Co-sleeping is possible, and has it's benefits. Talk to an actual professional to weigh your pros and cons, and in the long run, do what you feel is right for your child.  ",

            "+1 for this. Absolutely insane to read these comments advocating for cosleeping and other unsafe sleep habits. The confirmation bias is bizarre. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, it can happen to you. The risk is suffocating your baby. It happens way too often and it's infuriating to know some baby died because of a 100% preventable situation. I've **never** seen a cosleeping baby be successfully resuscitated and I've lost count how many I've participated in. They always come in early morning (weekends especially), hours after they were found down, cold and rigid without a pulse. And for the few who might survive to make it to the icu, their brains are absolutely nuked from being without oxygen for so long; low likelihood of making it to hospital discharge. Of course the goal is to save them, but the odds are dismal at best. \n\nAs for the folks talking about how it's OK to fall asleep in a chair. I actually had a cardiac arrest come in after mom fell asleep while breastfeeding; baby suffocated against her breast. Had plenty where dad or mom fell asleep on a sofa too, kid wedged in between them and the cushion. Yes, I understand this is unavoidable at times, but please please do everything to not fall asleep. Putting your kid back in their crib is better than a grave. \n\nThe real f*cked up part: you can't even touch your baby until the coroner comes and does their evaluation, which could be hours. \n\nI'm sorry if this upsets people. Hopefully it can have a positive impact by keeping others from making this fatal mistake.",

So many unrealistic or flat our developmentally damaging and problematic expectations are put on babies sleep. Sleeping (and specifically *sleep training is an enormous, nasty and cruel business*). \n\u2022 birthing in different countries looks differently and interventions should be seen as a backup if needed, not routine default. *Birth is a business* in many countries, and where not, it tends to be a chore. \n\u2022 SIDS was supposed to be about unexplained deaths but since *SIDS is a business* they added suffocation, intoxication, dehydration, overheating and many others into the mix to keep the bubble alive. \u2022 There's much more bubbles, trends and fear-mongering going on so just keep your eyes out and remember how targetted content works.\n2. Take pictures of your spouse even if she doesn't want them or is in underwear with greasy hair. Take pictures even if the house is messy. Take pictures even if she feels she's under/over-weight, both before and after birth. Take family pictures even if you don't like to be photographed. Take short videos of random things you feel normal (almost a daily occurence was baby hiccups and now I cherish this video so much). All of this will mean so much to you and your family later. \n3. Go on the trips, do your hobbies and modify and adjust stuff for kids. \n4. If every single kid gets every single thing new, there'll be a *lot of* waste going round for them to deal with in the future. Whatever you're comfortable and able to get second hand, try to do so. Ask for pre-used items even for gift occasions. \n5. Do not rush things that will come naturally with baby's development. Our society is overly-focused on achieving and being the best and first. Enjoy while the baby is happy on its own, enjoy while they don't want you to swing them nonstop, enjoy while they're mostly silent, enjoy when they need you, enjoy while they're clunky, enjoy while they can't yet climb stuff, enjoy while you don't have to rush from places for toilets... just enjoy the moment you and your baby are at. Strive to support them in their development but don't stress about being first, sooner, or above average. \n6. Nobody posts the 100 fails, they will all post the 1 success. Comparison is a thief of joy.\n7. Put away the electronics when you're with the baby as much as possible. \n8. Newborns love contact naps.

My guess is you're anxious about this quite a bit and it shows on the kid. If you force her to sit there, even worse.

Don't upload a shitton of pics/videos of your kids to social media, don't be that parent. We call FA \"grandma crack\", they can comment and surf to their hearts content, will reduce text requests for pics by 100% guaranteed.   \n\n\nWindy gas relievers, we called them butt whistles, they're little tubes you stick up your kids butt to relieve gas and poop. You're going to get poop on you, get over it, get the Windy's which will help things flow if they get constipated or bloated.   \n\n\nA white noise machine is a great idea, even just a basic fan (which you should have anyways to help prevent SIDS) for air circulation.   \n\n\nA sleep/swaddle sack, AAP doesn't recommend these, but they are safe when used properly. Swaddle blankets are fine when they are tiny, but ours houdinied that shit within a few weeks, a zip up sleep sack with multiple configurations worked great.   \nTeach baby sign language, not being able to communicate is frustrating as hell for everyone, basic sign language will let the baby SHOW you basic things they want (mostly food/milk).   \n\n\nA baby carrier: Search Mumgaroo 6 in 1 with hip seat. We tried A LOT of baby carriers, the wraps suck and are PITA, others let your baby sag in too deep and are a suffocation risk, get one with a butt support which will keep your kid in a proper position AND takes strain off your back.   \n\n\nGet a variety of books, the \"If I were a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" books are great and cheap as hell, sit down and read your kid some books at least once a day. They won't care for months, won't be bothered to really pay attention, but habit and routine are amazing and by a year they will really enjoy it. It will also break up screen time more.   \n\n\nBuy a Grownsy Nasal Aspirator, forget the bulb suckers, get an electronic one which is save you hassle.   \n\n\nWhen the kid is a little older get a Jolly Jumper, they are so much fun and the kid will love it, good for a 15-30 minute period where your kid has energy and you want to sit down and catch your breath.   \n\n\nI'll echo the \"PEDIATRICIN'S OFFICE\" number save, chances are high than any hospital system based pediatrician will also have an on-call nurse/staff which can answer questions immediately. You're going to be scared of every little sound your kid makes, having a quick number to call in semi-serious situations is important. If it seems serious or super serious, get your kid to an ER, know where it is and how to get there quick.   \n\n\nGet multiple rectal thermometers, they tend to break and the batteries die, nothing worse than being in a bit of a panic about a possible fever and not having a working thermometer. Store one in your diaper bag WITH vaseline, don't forget the vaseline.   \n\n\nDon't buy expensive things early on, they all get trashed and often times the simplest things are the best. A basic cheap backpack for a diaper bag, basic toys, etc.   \nYour kid is going to stick EVERYTHING in their mouth if given the opportunity, get used to it, try wipe stuff off if it finds its way to a dirty floor/surface, clean your phone regularly. This is how baby's learn, open mouth insert object, it's also how they build immunity. In the same vane, don't let your dogs lick your kids face, a dogs mouth is a petri dish of literal shit and NOT healthy.   \n\n\nEarly on buy packs of 1/2 of things to try before settling on a certain item, this goes for bottles, pacifiers, nipples, diapers, wipes, formula....basically everything.   \nYour dishwasher works as a sterilizer, if you are like us and don't have a dish washer then buy a countertop sterilizer. God it's a PITA sterilizing crap, do it for 6 months for your kids safety. Wash things with warm soap/water, then sterilize it, this goes for bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc (basically anything that goes in your kids mouth all the time).   \n\n\nI'm sure I've missed a bunch of stuff, just remember to take a deep breath and communicate with your partner. Take daily walks with the kid(s), get fresh air, give each other a break time to time. For most people the sleep gets better, then gets worse, then gets better, then gets worse, etc, sorry, you chose to have a kid and that's life for a while. Starting around 11 months ours really started sleeping all the way through the night, 11 hours straight, hopefully it happens for yours. Try not to freak out over every little sound, bump, bruise, scrape, fall, hiccup, fart and every other thing, you probably will, but kids go through this stuff and are resilient as hell. Finally, for the love of god try and cherish some of the early moments, days and nights are LOONNNGGGG, but the months/year(s) will be an absolute blur. Take as many photos and videos as you possibly can and put some of those memories deep in your brain somewhere to pull out when you're having a tough day.",

The sleep deprivation was insane. After that we used a sidecar bassinet co-sleeper but daughter always ended up in the bed after her first wake up in order to dream feed. I was hyper aware of her being in the bed and mom instinctively played defense. Mom exclusively breastfed and she 'spooned' or cradled baby during nights. We had a lot of anxiety about it but everyone really did sleep better, which made us way less likely to drive into oncoming traffic the next day or leave burners on.

            "Some final thoughts, especially about your partner:\n\nMy wife had really really really bad post partum depression (PPD), do your wife a favor and ask the hospital about PPD support after you leave. Our hospital/university had a weekly PPD support group (virtual at the time) which basically allowed women to communicate with each other about the problems they were experiencing daily. If there is no PPD group then find a PPD therapist, this is a very real issue and could last a very long time for your partner. Her psychology could be very fragile and we dealt with daily panic attacks and breakdowns for weeks, be there with a shoulder to cry on, a hug and feeling of safety and get her support with other women. It feels like an avalanche of pressure and emotions early on, having your partner be able to find support with others who have gone through this is hugely invaluable. \n\nConvince your wife to see a lactation consultant, maybe it'll come super easy to her and the baby if you are breastfeeding, but a lot of women have problems at least at first if not for months. You can see the consultant over time, once a week, once a month, whatever, they are hugely helpful in a lot of different circumstances. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask, ask your pediatrician questions, ask the nursing staff questions, ask different doctors questions. But DO NOT put all your eggs in the \"google said\" basket when it comes to anything. There are a million fucking opinions online, the vast majority aren't based on any science or medicine/medical practice. Chances are high you'll even hear different things from different doctors/nurses, just find a pediatrician that helps you when you need it and ask questions. \n\nDon't worry too much about the \"percentiles\" you'll see on various charts, our baby was 50th percentile all the way through pregnancy (basically \"perfect\"), born at 50th percentile, and then immediately dropped to like 5-10th percentile and until \\~1 year old was in that 10-20th percentile range. As long as baby is fed and growing that's all that matters. If you can't breastfeed then there is no shame in formula and bottle feeding, fed is best, get your baby fed and growing and keep it happy.",

They cite [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC28288/)\n study as evidence that bed sharing is more dangerous than sleeping on a separate surface. Here's a quote from the abstract of this paper (emphasis mine):\n\n> Conclusions  \nThere are certain circumstances when bed sharing should be avoided, particularly for infants under four months old. Parents sleeping on a sofa with infants should always be avoided. **There is no evidence that bed sharing is hazardous for infants of parents who do not smoke.**\n\nAre you sure *you're* reading the right studies?

The little one initially didn't move that much while sleeping so she tended to stay in there. On the other hand she insisted on sleeping on her belly and we chose to accept that as we had all other recommendations covered. And as soon as she learned to roll over herself that one is out the window anyways.\n\nAround six months old she was moving so much in her sleep that we decided to let her sleep in her own bed in her own room. She took her naps there anyways so it wasn't such a big change for her. Also she slept way better in a quiet room and with a babyphone directly besides her bed we knew when she was up or asleep.\n\nMy biggest gripe with SIDS stuff is that it is incredibly hard to do your own research. It's nigh impossible to correctly separate the individual issues and risks. Finally I found a great piece by a German doctor who discussed the problems you have with doing the actual studies. All studies have to rely on questionnaires filled out by grieving parents. So the data basis is skewed in the first place, especially once mistakes on the parent side are involved, such as drugs (alcohol, weed, whatever). Also many studies didn't do clean separations. He also referenced what /u/MBP_battery_king wrote, cosleeping becomes an issue once intoxication comes into play or once you fall asleep in a sitting position with the kid upon you. Many cases with the keyword cosleeping also had intoxication or outside of bed or non-parent person (babysitter, family friend or similar) as well but some studies just see that they all have cosleeping so that must be the issue. And as a normal non-science person you typically don't have access to the actual data so you can't interpret it yourself.\n\nIn the end the risk is already incredibly low, for example in Germany there were 164 SIDS cases in 2010. From 677947 births overall. That's 0,02% or 24 in 100000.\n\nDon't do drugs once you have kids and let them always sleep in a bed with ventilation should already be a great step. Some people need fixed guidelines like the campaign here. For us it was a little unnerving because you start to question your guts and your baby's behaviour because you can't find conclusive data about the issue at all.",

I\u2019m not sure what study she was reading; the closest I can get to supporting my statement is co-room-sleeping.  \n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-having-your-baby-sleep-in-your-room-2017060611855\n\nWe had a 3-wall cosleeper mini crib (with the open side facing the bed, and the crib mattress set to an equal height as the parent mattress). We would always put the baby in the crib, but if he wasn\u2019t in a deep sleep he\u2019d wake himself up by working his opera-volume crying. The only solution we were able to find to quiet him while he was dozing or lightly sleeping, was to have him in the bed with us. \n\nBut we had concerns that it could pose a risk to him. Our risk mitigation steps were:\n\nBaby sleeping between the parents to avoid falling off the bed. \nBaby sleeps on top of the sheet. \nTurn up the heat in the room (was winter) and eliminate the duvet, sleeping with a sheet only.\nMy baby-side arm fully under sheet and straight down the length of my body to avoid rolling towards baby.\nMother was usually feeding baby with her top arm cradling the baby. \n\nWe had a eating/sleeping journal for the first 3 months and some days were 18 hours of feeding. It\u2019s difficult to provide that amount of feeding time without having the baby in the bed for some of the day. \n\nHe has since become an independent sleeper; and I have added the 4th wall in his crib. There was a regression period at 6 months of age where he demanded same-bed-cosleep for a couple of weeks. ",
            "I have just looked at my search history but I can't find the article anymore. Also I wasn't able to actually find any data (even back then).\n\nIt was more that the article described how the interpretation of data differs which made sense to me so I was more content with the situation we had at hand.\n\nA friend of mine got a sensor-mat from their family that you can put below the mattress and that will sound an alarm if it detects no more breathing movement but they refused to use it. He said they would probably worry more if the thing does actually work than they worry about SIDS. Also imagine that thing sounding an alarm some day just because the sensor isn't good enough. You'll be scared shitless.\n\nNumbers are so low by now (I read that Germany had over 1200 cases in 1991 and they went down to about 150) that we decided not to worry about it. A main factor they did inform parents about were sleeping bags and sleeping on the back. The rest was added later on, as far as I could see.\n\nFor German articles see here: https://www.kinder-verstehen.de/mein-werk/blog/neues-zum-plotzlichen-kindstod-sids/ and here: https://www.windeln.de/magazin/baby/pflege-gesundheit/ploetzlicher-kindstod-sids.html and here: https://www.ploetzlicher-kindstod.com/",

So over the course of childhood, a lot of your cartilage slowly turns into bone rather than all at once.\n\nSo all 8 carpals exist in the baby above, it's just as cartilage rather than bone. You just can't see it in this x-ray because the type of radiation used passes through most tissue like cartilage and not bone.",

I don't think he even remembers the cast.\n\nI hope your kiddo is doing well and happy!",
            "So basically babies ossify (create bone) from cartilage as they grow older. That's why you'll often also hear about how babies don't have kneecaps, which is not really true - they do have kneecaps, they're just made out of soft bendy cartilage and don't become bone until the period between 2-6 years old.  \n\nThe same thing is going on in these wrist xrays - the cartilage ossifies into bone starting ~ 6mo and usually by around 1 year they have the first two carpal bones (capitate and hamate) with the last one showing up around 8 or 9 years old.  \n\nThat whole saying about babies being made out of rubber is not that far off :)\n\nEdit: What you heard about the bones fusing is also true, there are growth plates at the ends of the bones and certain ones like the sacrum (tailbone) don't fuse until way later in life, only about half of the population have their upper half of the sacrum fused by age 35!",
            "I saw a documentary series about the \"Babies first year\" while we were expecting our first, there was a lot of awesome new facts that were equally horrifying (in some cases the most horrifying parts were the experiments themselves).\n\nOne of my favorite facts from that show was a lady who wanted free access to her friends baby, because as a pediatrician you don't really get to see the kids as often, you just see them every few weeks, then months, then years etc. So when her friends had a baby she asked if it would be ok if she came by and did a health check every day. She took notes of the baby's growth and her temper that day etc.\n\nOne day there was a difference of about 1.5 cm from day to day in length, and she was sure she had just noted the length wrong the day prior, but she kept keeping records and after a while noticed that it happened again and again. So they decided to check more babies and noticed the same. So apparently kids grow like a ladder instead of following a curve of continuous growth as we are used to seeing.\n\nObviously this went against years of \"known\" science and thus she was both heckled and threatened when she publicized her work. But what she also saw was that kids tempers were really bad the days that they had grown over a cm from day to day, which isn't really strange xD... Imagine your bones suddenly getting 1 cm longer over just a day and all the pain in muscles that would come with.",

            ">> He didn\u2019t teach me how to be a father but more how not to, and that\u2019s still valuable\n\nTotally agree.  I still struggle with deciding why I want to have a relationship with him.  We are just too different.  I always think that if we weren\u2019t related and I met him on the street I would not have any desire to have a relationship with the man so why does the fact that he is my father make that any different.  How have you rationalized it?",

My dad has 3 months left (heart failure and lung issues = terminal sentence) and he has never married although thinks it's my mom's fault (he's always dated other women on the side).  I have two kids and the takeaway from his genetics is his heart of gold. He never wanted to be a dad and I respect that.  I fking love being a dad and I've always promised to never be like him on most ways but I respect him as my father...especially in these last few months.",

My dad is nearly 80 and has a pretty sweet relationship with my daughter (5).   \n\nHim and I are ok. I\u2019m the oldest so part of me is like \u201cI know I took the worst of it\u201d but I also fucking split as soon as I could and stayed gone nearly 20 years.   So I know they put up with a lot and probably worse after I was gone. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I get what OP is saying, but it\u2019s a journey. We all gotta live our lives and if your dad fucked it up, like mine did, well I don\u2019t think you\u2019re under any obligation to forgive or forget.   \n\nI will say I love my dad. We get along pretty well now, and hang out and have a laugh. But I also understand why my siblings don\u2019t.",

Forever thankful and I really hope he knows that. \n\nIt\u2019s really tough to visit him with a young child and FT job and a house and just crazy life. I\u2019m sure others can relate.\n\nSo what I found works is routine. Every Sunday evening I visit. Used to do breakfast every Sunday AM as he\u2019s an early bird and evenings he\u2019s asleep on the couch by 5, but do what you can.",
            "Hugs man. I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nI'm lucky enough to have a great dad - but he's dying, and I don't think it can be much longer. He's already beaten all expectations over and over - he was given \"days or short weeks\" *four years ago* now.\n\nBut the end is very much in sight.",

I broke my dad blockade just before my daughter\u2019s first Christmas because I knew whatever shred of him was left after years of haggard alcoholism was better than no grandpa at all!\n\nUnfortunately he doesn\u2019t really answer the phone or remember dates anymore so it\u2019s been a lost cause the last year or so.

Now he\u2019s gone. \n\nI look at my own kids and I\u2019m so grateful for my dad. Without him they wouldn\u2019t be here. In the end that\u2019s all that matters. It\u2019s not the small things you fight about that matters. It\u2019s life itself. Life matters.",

My kids are asking for him all the time. I miss him. My parents were to celebrate 50 years next year. Hug your parents guys.",
            "Thank you for the reminder. Currently, I also have a rocky patch with my dad. It has always been rocky tbh, rooted in unhappiness between my mom and dad's marriage, so we the kids could feel it.\n\nI would try my best but sometimes.. I can only try so much. The rest.. depends on his actions.",

            "Yeah, my dad died, shit, a month ago today. Despite being a caretaker for the last 6 months, I still wish we had talked more in other parts of our lives. \n\nBut at some point, you have to make that decision to forget the past and do what you can with the time you have now.\n\nIt kind of makes everything from the past seem petty. One's emotions and actions. But that is okay, too. \n\nI'm not really expressing myself well; it's like I did what I had to do, both times. Even if my actions seem contradictory.\n\nAnyway, sorry for your loss.",
            "Man I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This is really profound, thank you for sharing. It\u2019s bringing tears to my eyes as I read and some much needed perspective. Best to you and your family.",

Won\u2019t offer to get anything, and will ask my mom to get up and get him a drink or something, even after she prepared a lot. \n\nMy brother was the same to his now-ex wife and ex-almost wife (no surprise here for many reasons), so of course that behavior can span multiple generations.\n\nI can\u2019t say I never ask my wife to get up to get something for me, but I ask very nicely and ask if she will if she gets up for something else.
