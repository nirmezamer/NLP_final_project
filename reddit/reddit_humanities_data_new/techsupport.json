They lack nuance, give bad advice, can be \"bullied\" into saying outlandish stuff, and do all of these things while sounding confident and authoritative. \n\nAnyone can type their issue into ChatGPT and get an AI response. Real people can use real experience and reasoning to give better support, and that is what people expect when they post on a \"forum\" or \"social media\" or \"whatever garbage spez has turned Reddit into\"",

Just remove it from autostart... It's good if you have no clue what you re doing and don't trust Microsoft to do the job right. The native tools suck. Cc cleaner could well... Delete way more than you want to if you re stupid enough to select the wrong boxes.",
            "Install it, but be smart enough to not say yes to everything during installation. Also, make sure nothing about it is running, such as not allowing it to run on startup and no scheduled scans from within the settings.",

            "First up, a backdoor 2017 attack compromised ccleaner installed on 32-bit Windows systems, and an estimated 2.27 million machines were affected by the attack.  \nThen, in 2019, Avast revealed that malicious actors breached its network and were likely planning to target CCleaner in a supply chain attack but were foiled. Here, the hacker used stolen credentials to gain admin privileges but was unsuccessful at pushing out a malicious release.  \nThought is was pretty well known this program isn't good nor necessary. Just the security implications are what put me off from ever using is again (used it once on my phone in like 2010). What are you even using this program for? What is it actually doing that your father NEEDS it?",
            "Try to convince him to use PC Manager a windows app instead it does all the same things- and something more. I dont think its the main cause of the problem - i mean any modern (last 10 years) really shouldn't be that affected by clearing temp files. I like PC Manager as it can clear temp files from RAM and actually save some GBS by deleting old windows update install files.",

Then once the machine is rebooted, you can change anything you want, install apps, viruses, malware, download files, change settings, etc). Upon the machine booting back up, the snapshot is restored and all the changes are gone.\n\nYou can even configure a thawed folder so that folders like documents, pictures, etc don't get deleted on reboot.",

They expect it to be able to tell what's supposed to be there and not for every single user across every use case.\n\nThey don't back up the registry beforehand, then when it inevitably does it's best but doesn't realize that some random registry key belonging to obscure cheap program X will bork something on their install because reasons, and the user selected to remove it anyways.\n\nNow, because they don't have a backup and they didn't bother to check what things were before clicking delete, they call the program shit and move on.\n\nAverage windows PC user. I used to be this way, in the old times...",
            "Which ist fine but as u/Gamiseus said not everyone backups their registry beforehand",
            "Because there is no solution to OP's problem. They don't own the computer so they can't control what's on it. End of story.\n\nYour insults mean absolutely nothing. You come across as a bitter old lady. I would never trade my youth for your validation.",
            "God you're naive. There's multiple solutions to OPs issue, including password protecting the CCleaner application, creating sub user accounts without admin permissions so new apps can't be installed, blocking accessing the download page for CCleaner via the router, modifying the computer's local DNS table, or even depending on your security software blocking the .exe file from being installed/ran. Among others.",
            "Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal",
            "Right and all of the solutions you mentioned go against what the owner of the computer aka the parent wants to do with it... so what you are suggesting is going behind their backs to prevent them from doing what they want with the device they own...\nMy only recommendation here is having a proper discussion on the topic, present your arguments and try to reach a middle ground."
