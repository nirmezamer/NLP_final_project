Releases are staged to be available for all supported platforms on or after the announced date - Thursday 13th June 2024 - and will be released around the world **at some unspecified time in your time zone**. On most platforms, you should be seeing the update becoming available already. If not, please be patient. All supported platforms will be receiving an update.\n\n> ###What features are not in 1.21?\n\n> * Bundles are **not** in 1.21\n\n> * Villager Trading Rebalance is **not** in 1.21\n\n> * Apparently Hardcore Mode is **not** in Bedrock Edition 1.21\n\n---\n\nKnown Bugs: https://old.reddit.com/r/Mojira/comments/1df1csa/bugtracker_report_121/\n\nBedrock Edition 1.21 Release Notes: https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/27451789924237-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-1-21-Tricky-Trials",

Like I cleared a whole Chamber and all I really got to show for it was 3 diamonds, the rest was pretty much garbage like more food or poison arrows. It's a fun challenge and the Wind Charges are cool, but I dunno, I don't see much of an incentive to go back. Maybe I just got unlucky though.\n\nEDIT: Just tried another one and I got pretty good loot. 11 diamonds, a good bit of emeralds+iron, and two Fortune III books. Seems like I just got unlucky then, my first time I only got one Ominous Bottle and they seem pretty key to getting anything good.",

By the time NeoForge and MCreator are up to date, there is already another game version, incompatible to previous things. What do they do when adding new features anyway? Do they rewrite the entire code or something? Because adding some more biomes and mobs is nothing that should be that big to break all mods just a 0.02 version away.",

            "it is finally here",
            "Dear Mojang Team,\n\nI am writing to express my support for bringing back the classic PvP mechanics from pre-1.9 versions of Minecraft. Many players, including myself, have fond memories of the fast-paced, skill-based combat system that allowed for rapid attacks without the cooldown. The current combat system, introduced in version 1.9, has significantly altered the game's dynamics, and while it has its merits, there is a strong desire within the community to have the option to experience the old PvP mechanics once more.\n\nIn addition to removing the attack cooldown, I would also like to propose the reintroduction of sword blocking. The ability to block with a sword added an extra layer of strategy to combat, and many players miss this feature. Instead of using shields, which can feel cumbersome, having the ability to block with a sword would bring back a beloved aspect of the game's combat.\n\nHere are the specific changes I am suggesting:\n\n1. **Remove the attack cooldown:** Allow players to perform rapid attacks without the waiting period.\n2. **Reintroduce sword blocking:** When holding a sword, players should be able to right-click to block attacks, providing a defensive option that feels fluid and intuitive.\n\nThese changes could be implemented as an optional game mode or a toggleable setting in the game's options menu, allowing players to choose their preferred combat style. This way, both old and new players can enjoy the game in a way that suits their preferences.\n\nThank you for considering these suggestions. Bringing back these classic features would undoubtedly enhance the gameplay experience for many in the Minecraft community.\n\nSincerely,  \nDip\\_lo\\_rip",

            "The \"smaller features\" makes the update really good. On the first place the portal changes, but the copper blocks and tuff blocks are really cool, the trial chambers seem like an actual fun challenge and a cool structure.\n\nOne thing however with underground structures is that i wish they fit better in caves. Strongholds get absolutely destroyed when a cave runs through, a trial chambers is just a big box if u look at it from the outside, mineshafts and dungeons are really the only structures underground that look cool and part of the underground world of the overworld. I hope mojang will do something about that.",
            "I really love 1.21, looking at the trailer it feels like the Dungeons and Doggies update! I've been waiting forever to more gameplay content like new weapons and hostile mobs.",
            "As an explorer, I liked 1.19 and 1.20 better because it had a lot more to discover, but that's just my opinion, I appreciate the features even if they are not super appealing *for me*.",
            "I love the crafter as well as the trial combats, it is good that mojang caters to various playstyles in this update. Was kinda hoping there's a boss in this update though, but it's still a solid anniversary update.",
            "Except that it also dropped the same day as a major Helldivers 2 and Deep Rock Galactic update. I'm drowning lmao",
            "Year, super-dope. Average mod with single developer gives more content than big company. In 2024 Minecraft itself still has not obvious life-quality features like JEI/Jade/HP indicators and adequate maps.",

            "I thought that at first, but now I'm sitting on a lot of enchanted gear, enchanted books, and the new armor trims. Still have to get the mace too.\n\nThe bad omen potion makes drops a lot better once you get one. Honestly, given how long I spent in there, there's a good reason for them to be giving out a lot of food, I nearly ran out of my stack of baked potatoes",

Something like 24x with looting, meaning a single witch hut will provide about the same amount of redstone as Ian's stacking raid farm. You're boned on emeralds and gunpowder though, time to make a creeper farm and a mega trading hall. Hope nobody needs a lot of glowstone...\n\n...or bottles. The new oozing slime farms are going to be using a ton.",

            "Sodium and Iris are already updated for 1.21, and optifine shaders work with Iris.",
            "I think 1.21 is a much better update than 1.20 because it focuses on systems rather than content. Like being able to ride through portals, the crafter, the copper bulb, etc. It gives power to the player and the community to make things with the systems, rather than just another mob or block that doesn't do anything dynamic.",

            "I was playing hard with the trial being ominous. I spawned in base diamond gear and barely took any damage. Most of the chests were empty inside, but the barrels and pots had stuff, mostly bricks and emeralds. Most vaults were not ominous, so I couldn't open them. I got a notch apple and new armour trim as the best items from the ominous vaults.",

            "Why MCreator? Because it is an easy way to mod in things without being able to code. I really made some good things, like my cooking recipes. Make cheese from buckets of milk, make scrambled eggs you can eat, and combine cheese, bread and porkchop to make a cheese and bacon sandwich. Just for example. Also, I miss my mobs I modded in via MCreator. Gorillas in the jungle, rats scurrying around caves and villages, Giant Krakens in the water. I hope they can update MCreator soon so I can update my mods.",
            "They're being misleading. The Copper Bulb still functions as a one-block T-flip-flop (and light). It's the unique timing (1 tick or something) it had in an earlier snapshot that was changed.",

            "It also helps that the \"features\" of the update feel a lot more developed and fleshed out compared to 1.20 having a lot of stuff that's just fine",
            "As an avid Redstone I love this update for that but I also miss when updates were a big thing. Like if you played 1.18 today you would not really notice any changes but 1.16 revamped the nether and 1.14 did villages and even 1.15 fix a lot of issues in the code",
            "Watch out for the spanners, they reset every 30mins. Or break them it's your merengue",
            "I think it's better than the alternative where they are just floating in mid air though. It just looks better aesthetically to have it hanging by chains or logs. \n\nIt's not like I expect tons of strict realism in other areas of Minecraft.",
            "Yes, recipe-book has some advantage like less technical look and more role-playing/atmospheric.",
            "For those wondering, [here's the story behind NeoForged](https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/). Basically the entire dev team left the Forge project and started a new one because of 1 toxic asshole.",

            "Nice! I'm guessing for ominous mode you would probably want at least diamond then.",
            "That's interesting I thought the vaults should become ominous if you approach while having Trial Omen active. Unless you still had it while at the spawners but then it ran out before you got to the vaults?",

            "Learn Java bro, You won't regret it.",
            "Sodium is a performance mod like optifine, and Iris is an addon to that mod that allows you to use shaders. There's also modpacks like [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) that basically act like optifine (has most if not all the same features) but it's not updated yet.",
            "They did go back and revisit trims and pottery in 1.21, which I appreciate. They could\u2019ve easily abandoned adding new sherds indefinitely.",
            "Why does the alternative have to be the platforms floating in midair? The sane alternative is that cave generation just overrides mineshafts, like it does for Strongholds.",

            "Sure, but I think 1.21 features are mostly in a \"good-enough\" state. I could not say the same about many of the 1.20 features, which were either not even in a good enough state or \"just fine\"",

You don't get to tell him who to date, so why does he get to tell you what games you get to play? Taking away the pc is also ridiculous; you're not a kid who needs to get your iPad taken away when you misbehave.

            "Something which worries me about the way that the Minecraft team has been updating the game is that it feels kinda grafted on, and is often forgettable. Sure, many major features as well as some small features like glow squids are easy to remember, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re well-integrated into Minecraft\u2019s core gameplay (e.g. glow squids are very common.)\n\nBut like, there are also so many features that are just kinda there? Like allays, sniffers, archaeology, etc. \nEven copper, to a certain extent. You really gotta be actively hunting them down and actively giving them a purpose for it to be relevant. \n\nRecently I got back into Terraria, which seems to have integrated its new content nicely, and which also had the decision made to not make any more major content. The new content is for the most part relevant to the core gameplay and core progression system, which is neat. Fighting bosses, finding new ores, building up NPC villages and fishing all contribute meaningfully to Terraria\u2019s progression.\n\nMinecraft used to be linear in a similar way, with the end being a goal which requires a hunt for ender pearls, the creation of a nether portal and the exploration of the nether for blaze powder, the hunt for a stronghold and the fight with the ender dragon - which on the side requires finding better ores, mining, keeping oneself alive and sheltered, looting dungeons, etc. But now there\u2019s a lot of alternate paths that don\u2019t really lead anywhere. \nThis can be used to Minecraft\u2019s advantage, though, if the game designers can create multiple proper progression paths with satisfying end goals, as well as passively directing players through the system.\nI.e. you got the standard route for people who want to beat the ender dragon or whatever, maybe something related to the deep dark as well (perhaps the deep dark can be balanced around having an elytra and shulkers, so it \u201ccomes after the end\u201d in the games progression)\nmaybe archaeology has its own route involving more exploration than combat.\n\nthis post got me thinking :,)",
