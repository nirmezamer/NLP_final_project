            "I am interested in trying the 4 am waking-up thing. I tried it one day, and even though it was good, I didn't think it would suit my situation. \n\nSo I am living alone and I am a solopreneur. Apart from work, I got food to make, a house to clean, and other chores. These things take a lot of my time, and it gets hard to actually focus on the work. For example, when I woke up at 4 am, I worked from 4-9 am. Then I cleaned the house and got to prep for lunch. All this took me 5 hours. So now I have a few hours before I sleep at 8 pm. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I think I need to cut down on those 5 hours, but honestly, making food takes a bit of time lol. Any advice is appreciated.",
            "I have the motivation and headspace of a tea spoon and are looking for apps that can kick my butt.\n\n\n\nI have tried Habitica and Finch, but I just add the tasks I already do and it kinda takes away the point. I like the concept of the apps with RPG elements, but I am looking for something that can just give me tasks. Like, \"Hey, I think this is the time for you to clean the bathroom - you have three days\"\n\n  \nDoes something like this exist?",
            "I tried the 4am wake up over a month period and found I was tired in the afternoon.  Now I get up at 5am and I feel better for having that extra hour sleep.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that I have personally done:\n\n1 - Priortise my goals - Trying to do everything means I personally get stressed, overwhelmed and generally procrastinate.  I have had to learn to prioritise a few things rather than loads.  Focus on fewer areas where you can put more effort into it.\n\n2 - I paid for a cleaner to clean my house.  It was the best thing I did. It gave me back so much time.\n\n3 - Do what is right for you, not what everyone else says to do.  I'm slowly learning to listen to my body and intuition more and I'm seeing such a difference.  So 5am work for some but not for others.  \n\nHope that helps.  If you want more help message me.",

I am just trying to experiment.",

            "Honestly I always forget to take notes but from memory these are the most common points:\n\n1. To achieve flow state you should hide all distractions (phone in another room) and have a clear to-do list with big tasks broken down into actionable steps.\n2. A dopamine detox (no junk food, social media, porn, alcohol, ect for a certain period) can be helpful.\n3. Don\u2019t work and relax at the same place.\n4. \u201cBody doubling\u201d can be helpful for accountability (go to a library, cafe, find a work buddy online or work with friends in the same room).\n5. Always plan the next day the evening before and prepare everything so as to make as little effort as possible in the morning (gym clothes, work materials, ect).\n6. Habits are everything. To build good ones and to break bad ones, the good ones have to be visible, attractive, easy (reduce friction) and satisfying (track your progress). Make sure the bad ones are the opposite.\n7. Good night routine: take the time to wind down, dim the lights, no electronics, journal, read, plan the next day.\n8. Get 7-8 hours of sleep and go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday.\n9. To sleep well: relatively cold room, no light at all, exercise during the day, avoid caffeine too late.\n10. Good morning routine: wake up early to avoid rushing, don\u2019t snooze (otherwise your first action of the day is to procrastinate), get sunlight, drink a big glass of water, meditate.\n11. Shift your identity if you want to change (\u201cI try to stop smoking\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019m not a smoker\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m lazy\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019m someone who never skips gym). \n12. Best study techniques: active recall, space repetition, past papers, blurting, Feynman technique, flashcards, mind maps, non linear notes, interleaving, pomodoro + taking breaks (worst: summarizing, rereading, highlighting, multitasking). Intensity (deep work in flow state) > time spend.\n13. Notion and Google Calendar are amazing tools to plan your life. Time blocking is a good method for Google Calendar. Batch similar tasks.\n14. Manage your energy and not only your time: work at the time of the day when you\u2019re the most productive and \u201ceat the frog\u201d (the biggest/hardest task should be the first task of your day to build momentum).\n15. Set SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. Prioritize you goals and tasks (the Eisenhower Matrix helps).\n16. Always reflect at the end of the week to recognise what you\u2019re grateful for, what gave you energy, what drained you, what worked, what didn\u2019t and what you can improve. And clean you physical and digital spaces. Meal prep for the next week.\n17. Let go of perfectionism and just start. Motivation comes after action, not the other way around. The 5-minute rule: set a timer for 5-minutes, work seriously until the timer goes and you can stop. But you will be motivated to continue.\n18. Set boundaries and don\u2019t hesitate to say no when it\u2019s not a clear yes. Be more fully present and invested in you life and mental health to avoid FOMO (fear of missing out).\n19. Before grabbing your phone to scroll ask yourself if it\u2019s intentional or just automatic. The app One Sec helps.\n20. Identify the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your studies/job.\n21. Discipline is a muscle you have to train so you have to go outside of your comfort zone and just start. Tips: take a cold shower, 5-second rule (if a decision presents itself, you've got five seconds to act), start small, practice delayed gratification, change the location.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of right now, I know it\u2019s quite basic but yeah.",

This kind of sounds like a case that could be a late diagnosis. \n\nAlso in general it could be worth looking into how serious you take yourself and love yourself. There are a lot of \u201cshould be\u2019s\u201d and \u201ccould haves\u201d, but none of that stuff really matters until we really value ourselves and know what we want. When you build a track record of 8 years of NOT doing what you said you would do, it makes it hard to believe that you will really make a change, especially when you first attempt to change. You subconsciously teach yourself that you can\u2019t be trusted, so to remedy that, you have to slowly teach yourself the opposite, by keeping the smallest promises to yourself and then working your way up. It\u2019s hard but you can do it. Look up the Japanese principle of kaizen. \n\nI\u2019d recommend listening to the audiobook atomic habits by James clear. I say listen to the audiobook because it\u2019s easier to commit to. Even for just 5 minutes. Again I know it\u2019s pretty over saturated social media but this book is really helpful in breaking down habits and the science behind how our minds handles them.\n\nAlso look into the principle of changing your systems Vs making goals. This is a games changer in seeing how you plan your daily choices. \n\nI haven\u2019t listened to this one yet but I\u2019ve heard Scattered Minds by Gabor Mat\u00e9 is also very good for those who could possibly have adhd or show similar symptoms. \n\nTherapy can help you build a plan for the the next steps. \n\nYou\u2019re battling a multilayered struggle. Many of us are and there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. It\u2019s more common than you think. Please don\u2019t beat yourself up and give yourself grace. It\u2019s the only way to stick the journey through to a more satisfying life. \n\nI struggle with the same things and I\u2019m starting to see differently through.
