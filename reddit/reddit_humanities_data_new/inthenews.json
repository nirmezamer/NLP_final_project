            "I think some of the anti-Biden activists believe that people will rise up against Donald if he becomes too tyrannical. It is a laughably naive belief.\n\nIf the American people elect Donald Trump for a second term after all the terrible things he have done, he will be able to rule with impunity.",

            "I sincerely can\u2019t fathom how anyone can still think the man isn\u2019t serious about any of the monstrous things he says. He has no sense of humor, no humility, no capacity for self-depreciation, nor the introspection to highlight the worst qualities of himself to work on or improve. He says exactly what he wants to do. When he gets applause, he doubles down. When he doesn\u2019t, he finds a middle ground that will get applause, and builds a bridge to where he wants to go. He never backs down or reverses a position, he just waits and gets increasingly violent, angry, and vindictive. \n\nHis election was the very thing the electoral college was created to prevent, but has now been weaponized to ensconce a dictatorship in power against popular will. We should all be very frightened, because even if we beat Trump, the right only has one path forward, and it\u2019s not through playing by the rules\u2026",

            "Why would we think he was joking? He tried lots of his bat-shit insane ideas when he was in office before. It\u2019s just that the safeguards in place stopped some of them because he has no idea of the presidency or any of the government works.\n\nNow that they saw he can get power a bunch of evil maniacs who are actually smart have laid the groundwork to actually do all the fascist plans he wanted in the first place.",
            "Fuck these traitors!",
            "The balance of power in the world will shift to shitty if Trump wins.  It\u2019s not about the US anymore, Russia China Iran will just do what they want and Trump will go on \u2018missions\u2019 to his dictator friends and give away other people s land (Kissinger) and call it winning. EU will have to start producing its own weapons and organizing its own defense. In the US any election not going magatards way will be called \u2018fake\u2019 and Fox will go Rat.com, Putler style.

They each faced felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged document, which carry penalties up to four or five years in prison.\n\nWhen announcing their indictments, the state attorney general\u2019s office said in a statement they posed as \u201cduly qualified\u201d electors to \u201cdisrupt the results of a free and fair presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe alternate electors scheme relied on former Vice President Mike Pence to certify slates of Trump-supporting electors in battleground states instead of the true Electoral College votes cast for now-President Biden. Pence declined to do so on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the election certification, after which a mob of Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\nIn addition to Nevada, slates of pro-Trump electors have faced criminal charges in three of those states \u2014 Michigan, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers spearheaded the plan, and several face charges in other states in connection with it. Trump himself also faces federal charges and charges in Georgia in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in his favor.

            "That's not how it reads in the article posted. >\u00a0Clark County District Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that prosecutors with the Nevada attorney general\u2019s office chose the wrong venue in which to file the case, calling off a trial scheduled for January. > Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) brought the case in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, but defense attorneys contended that it should have been filed in a northern Nevada city closer to where the alleged crime occurred. This says the crime occurred elsewhere but the AG chose Vegas for whatever reason, possibly to tip the cards more in their favor with a more liberal county than the one the crime occurred.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0That's after this came down the last minute due to the 3 year statute of limitations. How does it come this close for a deadline you are aware of as an AG? It sounds like Ford screwed this case up royally, and I would question their competence as an AG to let thie case fall through\u00a0",

They\u2019re willing to let state legislators decide who wins elections because they think those people will always do what they want, even though history has proven otherwise",
            "Nope. \n\n The crime was falsifying the ballots, not mailing them. Where they were mailed from shouldn't impact the jurisdiction. This was planned beforehand to get them off and guarantee the judge was in on this. \n\n This is like falsifying your taxes going one county over, mailing them, and claiming the crime was when you mailed them.",
            "Not sure that would hold up. The law allows for mistakes as long as a good faith effort has been made. \n\nOf course that will come down to another judge",

            "I think the bigger issue here is elections are not managed under a federal body. It would stop so much bullshit in your country if it was.\n\nZoning, voting, counting etc. managed by one federal department under a single rule and impartial to any political will.",
            "They signed the false ballots in that jurisdiction and mailed them in from another. \n\n The crime was falsifying election ballots, and the crime occurred when they falsified them, not when they mailed them and the judge is fully aware of this and is only saying this to cover their tracks. I bet somewhere down the line this was done, so when they found the right judge, they could use this cover story.",

            "I replied to this already in a separate comment, but no, most of what happened apparently occurred in other counties.

            "But always in germany and when the cases is in the hand of a judge he or she would transfer it immediately or take it on. \n\nThis is just a case of pushing it beyond the election because of the judge\u2019s political beliefs. \n\nThat\u2019s why the election of Judges and prosecutors isn\u2019t the way to get a just system.",

            "Not according to what I read. Some of the documents apparently passed through Clark County and some of the defendants live there, but most of the other events occurred elsewhere.\n\n> Prosecutors listed 14 reasons why Clark County was the appropriate jurisdiction, including that two of the defendants \u2014 Law and McDonald \u2014 live in Clark County and that certain mail related to the fake elector scheme passed through the county. Most notably, fraudulent electoral documents were mailed to a federal judge in Las Vegas.",

            "It's not a do over. The judge, if I am understanding this correctly, says you have to file somewhere else. \n\nThats not a check mate you took too long. The likely would pass the burden of proof that they did in fact file in time. \n\nAgain the law allows for things like this. Even mistakes, if they are done in good faith, are generally allowed. \n\nThe trick for the defense would be to prove that it was somehow done in bad faith, which I can't honestly see but I guess anything's possible. \n\nSo they will likely refile or appeal.\nThe defense will claim that they have passed the amount of time they had to file. \nThe court will then ask when they files. \nTo which the answer will be for the first filing. \n\nGenerally the legal system doesn't work on \"gotcha\" nonsense that the general public seems to think it should.",

            "Maybe, but no one has been able to answer the question \u2018why has it taken so long to bring charges?\u2019.  I have yet to hear a reason why charges weren\u2019t brought within 12 months of the alleged crimes.  Even if they took an additional year, the case wouldn\u2019t be in the position it\u2019s in today.  \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I 100% agree that this is a politically motivated decision, but all of that should have been anticipated (because that\u2019s the world we now live in) when considering indictments.  This is as much on the DA\u2019s office as is it is on the judge.  The outcome may have been the same, but we\u2019ll never know, will we?",
            "Hmm so what proof do you or anyone have that the judge did it for that reason exactly",
