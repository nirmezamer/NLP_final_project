            "For non-trads / multiple gap year students, how did you adjust to returning to school? I know everyone\u2019s against pre-studying but I\u2019m kinda scared that I forgot how to study",
            "*Preface: This is looking into the future but something to consider as it's good to jump on this train early if you are going to do it. Also probably more information than you need right now but it's advice I got that helped me a ton. This is for when school starts, though, enjoy your break until then*\n\nIf anyone can swing it (you'll figure it out while you're in school) **I really, really recommend doing longitudinal study with Anki**. I used Anking v12 which you can keep updated for like $5 a month or just periodically with $5 as needed if you don't want to spend that cash. At first I wasn't sure if it was worth it but it has proven to be very helpful for me, personally.\n\nYou'll see it a thousand times here but I feel like a majority of my classmates did not do this. It's totally fine if you don't, plenty of people pass boards and match without it, but as someone who recently passed Step 1, it made my life so much easier. \n\n**Again, this is more than what you need for right now but just a testimonial for how keeping up with Anki reviews will help in the long run (even though it can really suck):**\n\nIf you have in-house exams or are at a DO school, it might be harder to do but especially if you have NBME based exams, it will make your life simpler in the long run. It is more work class-to-class but when our first CBSE (mock Step 1) rolled around I felt very prepared. I did ~60% of UWorld, two Uworld self assessments, new Free 120 and two CBSEs for board prep on ~2 weeks of \"dedicated\" which was pretty chill overall. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to get an AMBOSS discount, I'd recommend checking that out too. The \"for life\" thing is a lie (it's only for 4 years of med school) but the app is helpful and I completed the Qbank. The questions are geared for learning more than anything but between November and February I did ~30 questions a day and rolling into dedicated I was good to go. I also did most of USMLERx which is a good accessory if you need more practice questions during classes. They're a little easier IMO but it's tied in with First Aid so it's helpful and great reps. \n\nThere are some people who feel that AMBOSS is better than UWorld, I would say...idk. I think UWorld is closer to the real deal but AMBOSS (especially with the Anki addon) is a better every-day learning tool. It's important to treat it that way because the questions will have you pulling your hair out sometimes.\n\nFor practice question resources:\n\n**UWorld:** best for boards/exam prep IMO. Closest (but not the same) as the real deal.\n\n**AMBOSS:** great for learning, especially integrated with Anki addon. Will piss you off frequently. You can set a \"plan\" and it will allocate a certain amount of questions per day. I found this really helpful when classes sort of cooled off and I could focus on Step a little more before dedicated rolled around\n\n**USMLERx:** Great accessory before other Qbanks, a little easier but helpful. Also the easiest to sort if you're trying to target a specific set of topics.\n\n**tl;dr: if you can, keep up with your Anki reviews from class to class. It will save so much time, effort and anxiety come dedicated. GIVE IT A TRY but if you don't like it, that is also fine. I know plenty of successful people who do great without it. I think it's just the easiest way to stay on top of everything long-term.**",
            "From me as an MS4: Among the most important thing when picking a school is knowing your school has a home program in what you are interested in. Even if you do not know what speciality you want to do, try to figure out if you have an inkling interest(literally any type of possible intereste) in a competitive speciality, try to pick a school that has such home programs. That is amongst the biggest thing that differentiates students who match and go unmatch (of course other factors will matter).",
            "I feel like there are a lot of posts on here of M3/4s venting about the toxicity of their school or admin issues. How do we find out if a school is like that before attending? I feel like during interviews/second looks current students are a bit pressured to only say nice things",
            "1. How early should I try to lock in housing? I don't want to miss out on nice places but I also haven't been able to find any potential roommates yet\n\n2. How much time did/do you guys have for your hobbies during preclinical? Between studying, volunteering, mandatory classes, etc. I just have no sense of how much time I'll have left to chill, go gym, etc.\n\n3. How do you actually network to try and make connections with people at hospitals you'll want to apply for residency at in the future?",
            "What are habits that you have developed throughout med school that you wish you would have had from the beginning?",
            "when should i start supplementing my course work with outside resources like uworld/sketchy/pathoma/etc? are those only worth it when prepping for step or should you use them throughout school?",
            "Any recs for incoming medical students who have zero idea what they wanna do specialty wise? what research should you be looking for during M1-M2 if you\u2019re unsure around that time?",
            "For MS0's thinking of specialties...\n\n  \nI am a MS4 graduating matched into gen surg. Coming in I swore I would be doing anything BUT surgery. Thought EM for the first two years cuz I was an EMT. Got into the OR as a M3 and was so scared at liking surgery.\n\n  \nAll of this to say, keep an open mind. Shadow as a M1/2, do the research (esp if you are considering competitive stuff), but remember how while M3 is hard, you will learn what the day to day is like of things you may never have experienced.\n\n  \nWelcome to the hardest, but also coolest 4 years so far \ud83d\ude0e",
            "With the match becoming crazier by the day and PIs expecting longitudinal commitment to a specialty, when is the time to explore specialties you may be interested in?",
            "if im interested in starting research right as im settled (heavy research background), whats the right way to do that? Start reaching out to PIs? For context, i\u2019ll be going to a research heavy school.",

            "Thank you to all of the medical students who are answering our questions. I have some questions about research as I don't know what specialty to pursue yet. \n\n\u2022 How did you all get involved in research? Are there any skills that I can develop this summer before I start, to make me more competitive for acquiring research positions? (If the answer to this is to learn R, what is the best way to learn that without having an actual project?)\n\n\u2022 Do you have any hidden gem tips on how you were able to figure out specialty you wanted to pursue? \n\n\u2022 People often mention that residents are a great way to shadow specialties and maybe get on some case reports. How do I actually meet these residents? Those folks are way too busy to be at our med school interest group talks, no? \n\n\u2022 Any other general advice that really helped you in med school? \n\nThank you so much in advance.",
            "I was recently gifted netter\u2019s anatomy 4th edition by a coworker. Will this be useful at all for reference or is it too outdated by now and mostly a shelf piece? As I understand it there\u2019s an eighth edition available now.",

            "[deleted]",
            "Does everyone mainly do case studies, chart reviews, lit reviews, etc for research? Is it possible to do more \n basic or translation science ? Or is that too much of a time commitment for most students without a dedicated research year or time?",
            "I have read online that some people do not find Anki to work for them? So, what other study methods do people use besides Anki and why do some students say that Anki doesn't help them?",
            "can you include research from undergrad in residency applications?",
            "Hi y\u2019all, never thought I\u2019d get accepted to medical school. So never considered a lot of specialties.\n\n\nNow that I\u2019m in, I\u2019m starting to think.\n\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to be an oncologist but didn\u2019t like the day to day. I think I want something more dynamic like Surgery. \n\n\nBut my question is there any surgical specialty that has long term patients ? Maybe something related to oncology ?",
            "Which color and zipper-length should I choose for my patagucci?",
            "Does anyone else feel extremely unprepared after receiving their acceptance? like I don't even know what to start with to prepare to move out of state and start school. Do any current students have a list of the things they did or wish they did before they started school? (not like quit your job, go on vacation, etc.... I mean like fill out fafsa, find an apartment in your new city, purchase a stethoscope and scrubs)",
            "What's the meta for matching into radiology?\n\nIn premed, the grind was simple: clinical volunteering, non-clinical volunteering, research, shadowing, good GPA, and good MCAT. As long as you followed this, you were bound to get accepted somewhere.\n\nWhat should I be focusing on to try to match into radiology? (I personally don't care about the prestige, even if I match somewhere in rural Alaska, I am okay with it)\n\nSo far, all I can gather is:\n\n1. Good preclinical/clinical grades (try to honor as much clinical rotations as possible)\n2. Pass USMLE STEP 1 (failing it is saying goodbye to the dream)\n3. Get as high of a STEP 2 score as possible\n4. Radiology research\n5. Try to get AOA or GHHS\n\nCan I do absolutely no volunteering whatsoever, and get rads? Are there any other checkboxes I am missing?\n\nI got accepted somewhere with very low focus on radiology, and not much research going on in that field. Where and what type of research should I be trying to get?",
            "Critique my study plan?\n\nIncoming student, study question. Context: my school uses in house quizzes but NBME exams.\n\nI'm very conflicted on how I should best study and I don't even know where to start so I would appreciate any tips and critiques on the following study plan I have:\n\n1. Pre-look at in house lecture\n\n2. Watching corresponding BNB video\n\n3. Make summary sheet of high yields - using First Aid\n\n4. Unsuspend corresponding Anki decks - Anking\n\n5. Make comprehensive concept map \n\n6. Integrate practice problems every day\n\nI plan on doing this for each lecture and continuously repeating anki, reviewing concept map, practice problems, etc.\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated!",
            "Would it be wise to start exploring specialties before med school starts or is there time to shadow your first couple years? I have no idea what I want to do.

Medical students, what color did you get/wished you got?\n\nMy aunt is gifting me a litmann stethoscope for getting into med school, and told me to choose a color. I'm not sure what to go with lol. I'm thinking black since it seems like it can go with anything (scrubs and professional clothing).\n\nI'm also thinking the black-red one since my school's color is red and so I think it might go well with it lmao.\n\nIdk if I'm thinking too deep into it, but would appreciate some insight into choosing a color.",
            "This may be a stupid question but I was looking into getting a monitor in addition to my laptop to have an extra screen. Do most medical students have full desktop setup's or just monitors? I have a MacBook so I am kind of confused on how it all works.",

Do people often reach out to other programs to do research even though they have a home program? (I know this is far down the line and my mind is constantly changing)",
            "My key pieces of advice as an M3\n\nWhen you're stressing out: take a breath, drink some water, and remember to give yourself a little grace.\n\nIf you are struggling financially / want to protest absurd costs of education, almost all the resources can be accessed for free. There are a million threads on how to do this. I only bought a physical copy of first aid, everything else I \"borrowed\" from the internet library.\n\nThe following kind of depend on what study styles work for you... these pertain to what worked for me:\n\nAll schools are different but most medical students I know relied on self-teaching. For this, I cannot recommend Boards & Beyond enough. Again, there a million threads out there for you to peruse all the best study resources - pick a few, don't use them all. Check out B&B.\n\nStart using question banks or Anki or something along with your classes. I wish I had started sooner.",

I\u2019m so excited but also a little terrified. I\u2019m not expecting a traditional maternity leave but does anyone have any experience with either themselves or someone they know having a baby during med school and what kind of accommodations I should ask for/have access to? I\u2019m mostly concerned about being able to take enough time off to recover from childbirth and help baby adjust into the world before possibly getting into part time daycare (which usually won\u2019t accept infants until 6+ weeks). Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
            "I know I am likely getting ahead of myself here, and I understand the importance of essentially learning how to study \"correctly\" during preclinical, but I was curious on how to go about finding a mentor? I've heard/read stuff about having one - how necessary is it? (Is it speciality dependent?) And, how do I go about finding one?

Just by looking into our school's GroupMe and my cohort mates on Instagram, pretty much everyone else is a minimum of 2 years older than me, with most being in that 23-26 age bracket. I guess the thing that I'm most concerned about would be being taken as seriously as my older peers. It doesn't really help that I'm short and generally look younger lol.

The ophthalmologist I work with sees on average 70 patients everyday and usually I\u2019d probably see a decent chunk of these patients a day (maybe like 15ish) and come in contact with a few more to do scans and other testing.\n\nI was just wondering, I know you\u2019re assigned maybe like 3-4 patients while on service in like say IM, is there really that much information involved in the notes for other specialities?! Like the ophthalmology ones seem so brief from what I\u2019ve observed, are the other specialities really more like an essay?! I\u2019ve seen a couple notes from ER docs and subspecialities, is it really just time consuming getting all this info compared to ophtho where it\u2019s mostly just the physical exam plus a bit of history?

I\u2019ve been in a serious relationship for the past few years and we both have every intention of getting married when we\u2019re both done with school. My significant other has a job lined up once they complete their graduate schooling, which will wrap up in 2026, when I enter my third year of medical school.

I will be finishing up medical school in the same place, and so we\u2019ve begun to do a little planning for our lives together when that time comes. \n\nHowever, we all know what comes after medical school and that is a cause for concern.  Am I able to apply to residency programs that are exclusive to the area in which we would like to live, or when you apply to residency programs do you not have any idea where they are? I have no problem moving to a different part of the country, but I don\u2019t think my partner will be able to because of their job.

            "So sorry to drop a big post but this is the only place I can post on this sub so here it is:\n\n\n\nHello all,\n\nI was hoping to get some opinions. I was accepted to my local DO school which is roughly 30-40 miles from where I live. I am debating whether to move close to campus vs continue to live at home. I have spoken to some people who go to the university and gotten some mixed advice that I was hoping to clarify on this website.\n\nPotentially helpful data:\n\n1) I am single and living at home.\n\n2) Lectures are not mandatory and are uploaded shortly after completed in person.\n\n3) I have to be in person for OMM, anatomy, and one other in person event which often lands one of the other two days.\n\nPerson 1 is in a long term committed relationship and also commutes to school and equal distance and feels that it is manageable. They gave me a rundown of how they go about their day and its tough by their own attestation, but they manage to do well in their courses, nonetheless.\n\nPerson 2 also commutes and said that they are doing well with a similar commute to me, but they recommended staying close to campus for the first year because they felt that students who stayed close did the best on anatomy on account of proximity to the anatomy lab.\n\nPerson 3 lives near campus and strongly recommended moving close to campus because they felt that it put them in the best position to succeed and would recommend the same for me. They mentioned that after being on campus for the in-person classes, commuting back home and then studying would be tough on account of how draining the school materials would be and how tired I would be. Plus, in their opinion, as DO students, we have to spend more time studying and have less free time than our MD counterparts so the extra time commuting matters.\n\nReasons against: I'm hung up on the cost and actually living in the city. Cost is roughly 18000 a year and that adds up. If lectures are not mandatory and it's generally seen as a waste of time to go, then I am basically paying to live in a city that I only have to go on campus for 2 days which I find hard to justify. I also find my living situation to be super comfortable as it's low stress for me at this time and I wouldn't have to change much in my life as I just focus on studying. I would be willing to spend an additional day on campus to ensure that I am able to spend time in the anatomy lab and would be willing to bump that up as finals approach.\n\nReasons for: Despite the previous paragraph, I will be gifted enough money from my grandma to be able to afford the rent for 1 year so it won't affect me personally and no loans will be needed for that (any money not spent now will be used during aways). It's an opportunity to grow and get out of the house (commuted to undergrad and stayed home in gap years). Plus, I struggle with social things and forcing myself to go to a new city will force me out of my comfort zone. Additionally, as a DO, it's tough to get into certain specialties and I want to get into a surgical specialty. If didn't do well in my courses, I wonder if I would be able to forgive myself for not putting my best foot forward in preclinicals when I had the means to.\n\nAny thoughts that you guys can provide?\n\nTL;DR deciding on commute unsure for reasons",

My goal is to be as competitive as possible, but I don't have a clear idea of what to do to stand out, especially since I am a DO and my school lacks a research department. I found a mentor who is a MD and professor at NYU Grossman. I have started on a few projects with them, but I don't know if what I am currently doing is enough. I want to start early so I don't end up falling in love with a very competitive specialty in my fourth year that is unattainable due to the lack of X, Y, and Z in my application, or I \"could've done more.\" I also feel behind because I did not get an official research opportunity this summer/am only doing remote research projects sporadically.\n\nMy main questions are: How important are preclinical grades for competitive specialties such as surgery? What do I need to do as a DO student to stand out against other applicants? Am I doing enough/how can I improve?\n\nTo better understand where I am currently, my school is a graded system on a 4.0 scale. I am in the top 25th percentile of my class (first quartile), but I am unsure if this means much. After my finals, this might change. I have three abstract publications and 4 poster presentations.

Look for shadowing/precepting opportunities to help with this\n* Every once in a while you may see a resident at an interest group, but yeah that's rare. Probably would have better luck either emailing them direct, asking clinical level med students how to get in touch with them, email attendings, etc\n* Do anki from the jump and don't let up, it will make your life much easier. Outside resources will always be better than your school resources, so invest in sketchy, B&B, amboss, etc. No need to start studying for step 1 until second year. Have hobbies outside medical school. Take at least one day off from school every week, two if you can.",

            "It's possible, but both more time consuming and less prioritized by residency programs.

I *did* use smaller premade decks (Pepper deck for Sketchy micro/pharm, some portions of adytumdweller for Pixorize) in Step 1 dedicated to reinforce the nitty gritty, but that was using them like normal flashcards, not scheduled spaced repetition.",

            "For me, too many Anki cards can take me hours and start to feel passive. It really varies across block and lecture content so I don't use Anki all the time. In my opinion, it is mostly helpful for straight memorization of facts like in anatomy (I religiously used Anki in MSK) but not helpful for more conceptual content. I do go through Anking cards still to make sure I get important content for step regularly.\n\nFor example, I have found in my neuro block currently that all of the pathways we are learning are far too complex for me to understand through memorizing Anki cards. Instead, I watch lectures, review content and try to explain it in my own words/draw diagrams to simplify concepts, and then try and apply it to practice questions or cases. It also helps to study with someone else and practice explaining content to one another.\n\nI've used different study methods in every block so I'll just say to be open to switching it up if you feel like it isn't working! Don't feel pressured to do hundreds of Anki cards every day if you don't feel like it's helping you.",
            "You\u2019ll find that most medical students really don\u2019t use Anki the way it was intended and they give up on it too quickly. Research supports that spaced repetition and active recall are some the most effective ways of learning and retaining - aim to not only pass your exams but also retain that info long-term. Some common mistakes: not being consistent, not doing all the reviews, making cards and cramming them, doing too many new cards per day, suspending after each block, not understanding before memorizing. If you\u2019re consistent with it, it\u2019ll pay off in the end.",
            "There are all sorts of alternatives to Anki, many of which are used with it in varying doses, depending on the block, subject, amount of head-banging-against-wall-etc. For example, some of my classmates memorized the different sections and functions of renal tubules by repeatedly doing Anki; others practiced doing diagrams, pimping each other with questions, making their own paper flash cards, and/or outlining. \n\nThere's a substantial body of services out there that will provide alternative lectures and notes (and question banks). Some use First Aid for Step 1 as their only 3rd party resource. Others watch Sketchy over and over again. If it works for that unit, it works for that unit.",

The way I approached this was to make anki cards for my school's lectures while also finding the same info in the Anking deck and unsuspending those cards. After I took the test for each block in my school's curriculum, I would suspend the cards I had created from my school's garbage lectures (all of them) and continue studying the cards from Anking. Keeping up with only Anking cards was  more than enough to pass the CBSE (practice Step 1) in October while still having 2 pre-clinical courses left. \n\n  \nWhen you first get to campus try to find upperclassmen at your school who can give you more specifics regarding your school's exam structure and Anki strategy.\n\n>  If I'm really interested in eventually leaving my current state for residency and am aiming for a competitive specialty/program, how do I go about \"unlocking\" other regions?

A lot of the critical thinking comes down to figuring out why it's X diagnosis and not Y or Z, but they can easily ask you random factoids that you have no way of knowing other than straight up memorizing. It's rewarding though because you get to realize how much you do know, even if you feel like a dumbass every day. I know for a fact my M1 ass wouldn't even know where to start with the types of questions I'm able to get right now.\n\nAll of that being said, you will be fine. Just grind Anki and third party and trust the process. You might feel very different about memorizing when not memorizing could mean killing someone down the line, or worse - failing boards (joking).",

I only used it for things that I needed to learn by heart/brute-force memorize (mostly anatomy) as well as during the lead up to exams I would make cards for things that I was consistently getting wrong and forgetting. This meant that I never ended up with the thousands of cards that you see on social media. That would have been super overwhelming for me and I would never have done them.",

I also made my own cards for the MCAT and find that while it can be time consuming in med school, it actually works really well for me. I find that taking the time to make a card is another way to process lecture info.

Good quiet areas, comfy seats, kitchens/fridges? Sounds silly, but even if you'd prefer to study at home there will be times you're stuck on campus for one reason or another.\n\n- In house exams or NBME? NBME generally provides an easier transition to Step 1. My school was in-house and the questions were fair, no big complaints, but some in-house exams vary wildly in terms of fairness/minutiae.\n\n- How frequent are OSCEs/Standardized patient interactions? How much do they suck? Ideally they're prepping you to feel comfortable 3rd year, so they'd be more frequent, but mostly ungraded & chill.\n\n- Timing of quizzes/exams, and timing of anatomy practicals vs. exams. Do they give you time to do nothing but study a few days pre-exam? Are quizzes weekly, infrequent, or none at all? Are anatomy practicals mid-block, or do they overlap with block exam time? How do students there feel about their schedule?",

Look at the match list for the past 2-3 years and see where students go in terms of specialty + programs overall.\n\nAsk upperclassmen about how easy it is to do research, get mentorship, etc in their desired fields. Also some schools are transitioning to shortened preclinicals vs 2 years, so that's important too. Time off during M3 rotations is a question I'd ask as well, along with resources for counseling/mental health stuff.",
            "I would look into where people do rotations, the curriculum for when they take step, and the opportunities the school provide. Some activities are far easier to do at more established schools that have facilty in specific fields. Rotations quality goes without saying since it going to be more important with p/f preclinicals. Seeing how the schools evaluate third year and how good of a training is crucial.",
            "My use of Anki has changed through every block of first year so far. My school has in-house exams so we have school specific decks that can be extremely helpful for our school specific lecture content but not as helpful for STEP, so I end up doing Anking in addition to school decks. Overall, I find Anki most helpful for lectures that are mostly memorization based (like pharmacology and diagnostic criteria) and for anatomy.\n\nIt's also about how much time you are willing to dedicate to it. Some blocks had too many cards and I couldn't keep up with hours of Anki every day. It felt passive to me and I didn't feel it was really helping me remember anything. This is different for everyone though!\n\nMy current method is that I'll try it out at the beginning of each block and see if I feel like it's doable and if it is helping me retain content. If not, I'll only use it for lectures that are mostly straight memorization. My best advice is to be open to the fact that study methods (in my opinion) cannot always be carried across blocks. I've used completely different methods and routines each block. Try methods out and if you aren't happy with the results, don't be afraid to try something else. There's no single best way to study.",

For in-house stuff it will be very school dependent - though as someone for whom anki works well in general, I just made my own cards from lecture slides and mixed in some AnKing cards for Step prep. \n\nWithin most systems there's usually at least some stuff that is more conceptual/process based for which anki will be less helpful (e.g. acid-base disorders in resp) so it is not a replacement for practice questions/cases.",

Not to mention that it's going to take a huge chunk of your time to make Quizlet decks versus Anking being right there already made for you.

You can certainly still be successful without it, but it is a really helpful tool and spaced repetition is more important in med school since you are learning much more information each day compared to undergrad",
            "Personally I used Anki for step 1 for \u201cbugs and drugs\u201d - it was maybe a couple thousand cards and not more than 100 a day during the few months leading up to dedicated. Didn\u2019t use it for in house exams and barely for step 2 and still did very well. The brute memorization doesn\u2019t work for me again with the exception of bugs and drugs which does benefit from spaced repetition. Just my $0.02 to give you a different POV!",
            "I also hated Anki with a passion (and I started using it in med school), but I've found that it does help me retain information. Compared to other med students, I can only do a very few number of cards a day and I didn't like using pre-made decks. Since you mention making your own, I'd recommend you make your own Anki cards, which is what I did. So I pretty much only made an Anki card when there was something I REALLY needed to remember and wasn't remembering. \n\nI know you mentioned you wouldn't trust yourself and kept cycling cards. How long did you try Anki for? It definitely takes some getting used to especially for me (did engineering in college, so flash cards were not my jam). But the spaced repetition really maximizes efficiency. Given the amount of material flying at us in med school, efficiency is key.",
            "It's hard to put a number on how many new cards per day because for me it depended on how many I made for our shitty in-house lectures that day, plus whatever else I unsuspended in Anking. Some days it could be a few hundred new cards, lighter days less than that. If I had to make an estimate, I'd say I was doing a ballpark of 600-800 cards overall per day, with some days lighter or heavier depending on when the next test was.\n\nAs someone who just recently upgraded to the newest Anking deck after 1.5 years of using the older version, upgrading is worth it. There are actually quite a few changes to cards, plus lots of tags have been updated to correspond with more 3rd party stuff, for example Bootcamp. You can pay the $5 for Ankihub once to get the v12 deck and just cancel it immediately. Of course your deck will no longer get the regular updates, but it should be fine anyways and you could always pay another $5 for an update before you take boards.\n\nIf you're gonna be a dedicated Anki person, I can't stress the importance (at least IMO) of using Anking as much as possible. Don't use the shitty decks from your classmates, and try to make as few of your own cards as possible. Also do not re-suspend Anking cards. It makes life harder with reviews, but you will thank yourself when dedicated rolls around.",
            "I unsuspended based on whatever unit I\u2019m on, and then divided up the number of cards I had total by the days I had to do them. I like to finish at least 5 days before an exam. Usually this was about 50ish new cards a day but for really dense units I had up to 120 new cards a day (ew). See if your school\u2019s upperclassmen have any adapted AnKing decks where they have lecture based and relevant AnKing cards tagged for each unit. \n\nI took step 1 2 years ago and I used a super outdated AnKing deck (i had like v3). Anywho, I passed! Medical knowledge changes yes but not that much that quickly. During MS3, many of us still swore by 10 years old Emma Holliday videos. I do not believe in paying for Anki unless you are buying the little joystick thing. I did not use AnKi for step 2 cuz I didn\u2019t find it as helpful. Anki operates quite a bit on buzzwords (helpful for step 1) but step 2 had so much reasoning through cases that flash cards didn\u2019t really help me. If you do want to use Anki for step 2, again, just go for the latest free version or whatever version is passed down in your school. \n\nSide note, some people swear by the 20 dollar Anki app. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it as you can just access the website for free on your phone. But, if you wanna support the Anki people and want the convenience of knocking out cards on your phone, go for it.",

Your ranking determines how long it will be before you see that card again. There's a lot more to it but that's what Youtube is for. Anking is a popular Anki deck that is a comprehensive resource for studying boards material.\n\nThe Anki app is unnecessary and I actually would not recommend starting with that. You want the PC/Mac version in order to set up your decks, settings, addons, etc. Then if later you want to be able to study on your phone or tablet, you can get the app and sync it with your PC version.",

Sometimes someone will ask you for help and you'll be able to tell them something they don't know.

There is no dermatology, ortho, optho, etc, residency anywhere else in the state.

I'll shadow EM to see if it's something I want to do as well. What kind of extracurriculars do I need to do to match into these specialties - is it okay to do general surgery research to match into ortho? \n\nOrtho is competitive no matter where you go. You'll likely need to score highly on step 2 as well as honor your clinical rotations, particularly the surgical ones. I would also strongly consider doing away rotations at locations you're interested in for residency. You should also aim to get involved with research so you can publish. \n\nGeneral surgery is less competitive, partially because there are many more programs and many of them can be malignant. Also there are a lot of community programs which can be seen as \"less ideal\" compared to university programs by laypeople but you can actually get great training at many places. I have friends in both and they've told me they've about positive and toxic experiences in either type. But honestly, you should not be worring about this less until you're an M4 and applying.\n\nThe \"Charting Outcomes\" PDF for the match has all the data on successful and unsuccessful applicants.\n\n> And how do I stay efficient with my schedule from day one? I'm also interested in joining the school dance club as well - I heard they meet once every 2 weeks or so - would this be feasible/worth doing? And can I find research labs through an orthopedics or surgery interest club? \n\nMed school studying is likely unlike anything you have done in undergrad. The volume and depth of the material will hit like a brick. Your best bet is to develop study habits that allow you to efficently process and retain information. For some people this is anki, for others it's board questions, or both. Some people like watching lectures over and over. Some people still retain material reading textbooks. The more you experiment and figure what works best for you, the better you'll set yourself up for success.\n\nYou should only be diverting energy to extracurriculars after you're able to handle the material. There is no sense in doing things like dance club if you're not passing school exams.\n\nClinical research will be dependent on you cold contacting physicians who are involved in it. If you're at a school with an ortho department, someone will be doing research. Your school may also have niche ways to connect you to research advisors as well. I would not recommend doing basic science research- while it's much more substantial in my opinion, it takes much longer and doesn't always have a publishable result. When evaluating research work, many residency selection committees don't value quality research, they value quantity. You only have 3 years to residency application and it's best to maximize your time.",

They're probably used to doing it for med students if you're at an academic institution.\n\nStorage depends on your undergrad, some will have a premed office that handles it for you, some don't and you use a third party service, etc, I would reach out to your school's premed services (if they ahve one) for more info.\n\nConventional wisdom is 2 science professors, 1 non science professor, and a doc if you can get one",

            "**Spend as little as possible.** Buy secondhand from older students whenever possible.\n\n1. **Steth** is most important but you have that sorted out. Litman Classics or Card 3 or Card 4 are the gold standard, but $$$. MDF also makes good cardiac steths, they have longer tubing but are super heavy compared to the Litmanns and will strain your neck after a while.\n\n\n\n   1. **MAKE SURE YOU USE THE RIGHT SIZE SILICONE EARPIECES** on your steth. Usually they come with both a large and a smaller and/or regular size. If they don't fit well enough to form a seal in your ears, you **will not hear well** during auscultation. I realized my earpieces were too big halfway during M1. Swapped them for smaller eartips, and it was amazing. I was hearing in 4K after that.\n\n\n\n2. **Opthalmoscope/Otoscope kits are all mostly garbage**, unless you shell out $600+. Use the mounted scopes on the walls of your practice rooms to learn outside of class. A cheap set is fine for the classroom, but you won't be able to visualize well on fundus exam. My school has panoptics we can use with the instructor for extra practice, but they were closely guarded school property. I bought a $70-100 scope kit from a random Amazon brand, I and regret it. It's basically a movie prop that doesn't do shit and doesn't magnify or light up anything enough. If you ever get the chance on rotations, learn to examine the eyes with a panoptic or have ophthalmology teach you with a slit lamp. Waaaay better but more tailored for people who want to specialize in eyes.\n\n\n   1. **Breath mints or chewing gum before examining anyone's eyes or practicing on classmates. ALWAYS.** You will be uncomfortably close, close enough for you to  kiss, exchange coffee breath and examine every pore on each other's face.\n\n\n3. Don't get a tomahawk (Taylor) reflex hammer. They are not weighted properly**. Get a Tromner (most of us have this**). Alternatively, a Babinski, or Queen's Square will do  (don't attack me plz neurologists).\n\n\n4.  **Tuning forks**...get cheap from amazon. Or borrow from a classmate. My school has extras if we needed them.\n\n\n5. **Penlight**-- may or may not need. Otoscope light or ophthalmoscope light can do most things. Penlight is better for the wards/rotations etc, but again, school dependent. Get one that has a dimmable light that is not too blinding. Most penlights are dangerously strong with too many lumens, and it is discourteous to bleach the retinas of your patients or classmates you practice on. but good for throat. Good for fumbling around a dark patient's room at 5am trying to untangle IV lines.\n\n\n6. **Doctor's bag/medical bag**-- to hold all of these fun supplies that you won't likely use after M2. Up to you. Some classmates have swanky leather doctor's bags that cost a fortune, but most opted for the school sale version. A nylon medical bag from ADC or MDF will do, and is non-pretentious, durable, and cheap, about $35-40.\n\nAgain, you will probably only use the steth, hammer, and the penlight after M2. everything else will collect dust.",

            "Yes research helps *to some extent* for competitive program applications, however at your level I would worry less on trying to hustle for it so early on and focus more about getting your feet wet when it comes to coursework. More often then naught, the volume of material young med students realize they need to learn is a shock to what they experienced in undergrad.\n\nOnly when you've comfortably settled into preparing for exams, that would be a good time to pursue other things like research. Clinical research is easier to learn then translational research/lab work. Explore your faculty list and reach out to someone who's working in a subject that seems interesting to you. It helps if they're productive and actively publishing. Typical clinical research projects med students can work on range from retrspective/prospective studies, descriptive studies, case reports (which arent technically considered research), or things as involved as meta-analyses. Once you find a mentor, you can iron out those details and expectations.",
            "To go off what u/PerformerEmergency22 said, I know my school had a pre-made Anki deck that was made by students and then tweaked and passed down to the next class. Talk to some second years and see if this is an option at your school. If not, maybe send something out in your group chat and see if anyone else made a deck for the lecture you are working on. The biggest thing about med-school is learning to be efficient with your time, so if someone else has already done something that can save you an hour, take advantage of those resources",
            "It really depends on your school's curriculum. Third party resources weren't really necessary for M1 at my school, which was basically the anatomy, physiology, and histology of all the systems. B&B is helpful for pretty much everything, but it's not absolutely necessary for the basics if you're able to learn through in-house lectures. The biggest piece of general advice I have is to start using Anking as soon as possible. Look up the cards that relate to your lecture material, unsuspend them, and leave them unsuspended so you keep studying them even when that block is over. This not only cuts down on the burden of needing to make your own cards (which I would avoid doing as much as possible), but it sets you up well for boards.\n\nOne thing about medical school is that literally everyone studies differently, so it's not really helpful for someone to tell you their exact study routine. It's about being efficient with a study method that works well for you personally, is sustainable, and gets you the kind of grades you want. You might need to do some trial and error to find out what that is for you.",

            "wait we're already supposed to start thinking about step??",
            "Depends on your schedule. Do you have to go to class every single day? Or just a few days a week? Plenty of people at my school commute 30 minutes, but our preclinical years usually didn't require daily attendance and very rarely required us to be around the whole day, making commuting a whole lot easier.",
            "Corollary: Don't be afraid to try new things and ditch things that don't work for you. A lot of people love Anking. I hated it. Some classmates performed way better than I did and never used anything Anki. The only best way to study is what you find success with.",
            "hey! with that said, what are some study techniques that you would recommend?",
            "Depends on how your school is designed. Some schools do in house lectures, others do NBME (national standard). If your exams are NBME the Anki and question banks will fit better, if not you'll find yourself studying minutiae from a professor's PPT slides. Otherwise most people will do just Uworld. Most of the people I know don't actually own Amboss. I think it's great to do for higher understanding after finishing Uworld but there isn't always time. That may be more of a help third year though.",
            "Depends, my school has NBME exams. I typically went USMLE - AMBOSS - UWorld. UWorld being like 7-10 days out from the exam normally.\n\nAnki just depends on your curriculum. It's more cut and dry with NBME based, P/F etc. It is the first thing I do every day and if I'm early in a course it's a few hours, later on with no new cards its less. And M3 it'll be as little as I can comfortably do.\n\nIt's a grind but it works, especially if you can carry that into board prep.\n\nIf you're at a DO School with graded exams (more common, idk how many MD schools still do that), that sucks because you're going to be inclined to study class materials which are likely low yield for boards.\n\nBut if you can swing it, looking forward, at least piece out what's relevant to class + boards in Anki. Try your best but if it's detracting significantly from school then you might have to switch it up. Anecdotally people have been able to find a balance but I can't speak to that specifically.\n\nAll three Qbanks aren't necessary but I found as someone who basically never looked at lecture material I had the time and it sucked less. I also ended up rarely watching videos, just priming with First Aid, doing Anki then PQs. But that's probably not the norm, and again I had the benefit of P/F and NBME based exams so the off the wall shit they can put on in-house exams wasn't something I had to mess with.\n\nAll of this being said you'll find a rhythm regardless. There will be senior classmates who will help you with your program specific stuff and you'll have time to see what best suits you. My main takeaway would be try your best to keep up on old material but if you can't swing it for whatever reason, plenty of people do fine. It can just make board prep easier, which is a very stressful time as I'm sure you can imagine.",

Would suggest trying to meet local orthos during first and second year to make connections",
            "I strongly second this comment, specifically the fact that your (excellent) plan has all its bases covered with room for modification like adding sketchy, or creating a slightly different study product than a concept map depending on the topic. But the most valuable point here IMO is that this is a lot of work you've laid out for yourself. You definitely should be conscious that not every single component will be always perfect fit for your brain, the topic, or your schedule.

They can be expensive so don\u2019t buy them until you\u2019ve talked to med students at your school in the years above you (they will know best if lectures are worth it or if third party resources line up with exams). Do the free trials, see if you like them, or if you feel you can get by with lectures, or if there is a pooled resource document that your school has. And do no start seriously studying before school starts, but I do suggest messing around with Anki since it\u2019s free. Look up tutorials, download the anking deck, try out some different settings, and get used to the software so you can decide how best you\u2019d like to use it before the pressure of school sets in.",

            "Watch the Anking youtube video on the best anki settings! You\u2019ll probably tweak them as you get used to it but I think having more flash cards with less details helps. Also going to or watching the lecture and then immediately doing the anki helps! Idk how else to explain it but it comes together much better when you start getting content.

            "Imagine being an attending, and regardless of your beliefs, just decide to shit on a mid-level student. I think we're all smart enough to realize that's gonna be at least a 3 hour lecture from HR and an assigned 20 hours of teamwork and safe work environment modules right there. Story was definitely sus, the moment they mentioned the \"ED docs\" being hard to please.",
            "The fact that a fucking ED attending of all people was lauding a student for thinking about antibiotic mechanism of action was laughable. Every ED just gives vanc cef or vanc zosyn if the patient looks like they have any infection. I doubt that ED doc thinks about the mechanism of action of vancomycin even once since medical school",

            "Huge \u201cand then everybody clapped\u201d vibes",
            "ironically the midlevel student in that post was the one in the right, if it's not empiric coverage most people use the cheat sheet, and if it's more complex than that you consult ID.",
            "Replace silly with attention seeking and emotionally stunted and I'd agree.",
            "Remember to flip the hair, and make it a slow clap.",
            "ED docs just want to talk about hunting, trucks, and golfing",
            "As an ED physician this definitely isn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t think anyone often thinks of antibiotic mechanism of action when choosing coverage, but we certainly put thought into what we order.\n\nI\u2019d say if someone comes in septic and shocky, we typically do start broad spectrum abx. However, if someone comes in borderline septic or with an infection/fever with localizing symptoms, it\u2019ll usually be more targeted. Fever, productive cough gets CAP coverage, fever/dysuria/foul smelling urine gets Rocephin, cellulitis gets vanc. Practice is pretty similar to the rest of the hospital for undifferentiated infection. The floor is just fortunate enough to typically have the answer by the time they see the patient. They also end up with sensitivities from cultures and can narrow.",

Seems like you treat different infections with appropriate antibiotics for the most common bugs causing those infections, which is what the PA in the initial post was proposing. Nobody here making fun of ed docs for blindly prescribing things, just making fun of the med student daydreaming about a weird fantasy where they are so smart they know mechanisms and that makes them loved in the department",

        "content": "I (25F), R1 resident (not in the USA), have been diagnosed in early 2023 with a most probably benign brain tumor ( left 3rd nerve schwannoma or meningioma infiltrating the left cavernous sinus). Clinically, I have a near total 3rd nerve palsy, constant orbital and retro orbital pain and diplopia. \nThe neurosurgeon I consulted in early 2023 suggested a wait and see approach with MRIs every 6 months, since surgery is quite risky. \n\nAs of April 2024, the ptosis is getting more severe, my eylid is 90% closed and my vision acuity went from 9/10 to 7/10 and I feel it getting worse. \nNow the neurosurgeon is suggesting either decompressive surgery or radiosurgery with gammaknife which is not available in my country, so I'm applying for VISAs to try to get it done in a foreign country.\n\nI don't know how to deal with this whole thing AND the stress and anxiety of residency anymore.\nI can't take a LOA til I pass the first year exam which will be in October but I have no will to study, I've been going from doctor to doctor for months to have more opinions on my condition. I feel fed up with hospitals and medicine in general. I just want to take my mind off this whole thing but it's impossible while working in a hospital. \n\nWhat can I do to motivate myself to study ? \nHow would you guys deal with a situation like this? \nSorry for the long rent, I just needed to get if off my chest I guesss.",
