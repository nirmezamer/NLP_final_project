While it's sometimes funny, full-blown conversations are ridiculous. It's a supplement for low engagement from real users.\n\nThat's excluding the bots that aren't stated to be bots. (Which is the majority of posts on Reddit)\n\nIt's not as bad as Twitter, but it's getting there.\n\nThat alone is a site-wide issue, but removing fan art is different.\n\nThe decision to remove a significant portion of fan-art could potentially lead to an increase in AI-generated art, as artists may lose their primary source of commissions. This could also detrimentally affect the fan-art community, particularly those dedicated to Bleach.\n\nReddit is a great place for artists to gain a reach that is usually impossible (especially for smaller artists).\n\nBanning it with an arbitrary rule needs a better reason than \"I don't like it.\"\n\nI primarily use Reddit to avoid AI junk for series I like. r/bleach is the only sub in the Big 3 that doesn't allow fan art and official art from Kubo of female characters based on rules that can mean anything.\n\nAnd for those who accept the rule, it only further over-sexualizes any post related to a female character.\n\nThe current rules, which restrict artists from gaining recognition, while allowing AI bots to engage with users, is a clear injustice. This disrespect not only affects the artists but also Tite Kubo, the creator of Bleach.\n\nI doubt this post will change anything, but I thought I'd put it out anyway, so I did my part.",
            "i like the aizenbot, obviously i'm biased though.\n\nif there was something like a 3-strike policy applied to urahara**bot to ensure it doesn't get toxic or gross, same should go for aizen. i do think bots should only reply to bot name and not character name though as a rule.\n\naizen is more emblematic of bleach to me, as far as what characters should be allowed to be bots i think mod / community judgement should be used there - so thanks for at least creating this post. bleach has a billion characters, i'm sure all of us can agree it can get out of hand easily.",
            "I feel like a lot of characters wouldn't even be that good as bots.\n\nUraharabot is cool because in the series he's always been that silly and yet shady mentor. He's perfect for that.\n\nMaybe my imagination is too limited for this, but there are only a few other characters that would work well with this concept. Since you already mentioned prequelmemes, I think they're overdoing it over there.\n\nSo I tend to be against more bots, unless you can vouch for an in-character quality level comparable to Uraharabot.",

Even just one more... I think it's extremely unlikely not to bring the community down to have 2 bots, let alone more bots.\n\n*Unless* that is the community's entire point. i.e. I think a bleachbots sub or something with like 10 bots in it -- Uraharabot, Aizenbot, DonKanonjibot, Quilgebot, Tsukishimabot, Kyorakubot, Yoruichibot, etc. -- sounds like delicious chaos. But then that becomes the sub's identity -- It's not a sub to discuss Bleach, it's a sub to engage the bots and partake in shenanigans. That's not *bad*, it's just *different.*\n\nMy two cents. Keep Uraharabot, maybe trial Aizenbot for a week or two at most and then have the community reevaluate, but a hard line should be drawn for r/Bleach at 2 bots. No more. Maybe if we want another character bot then we swap it out with one of the existing ones or something, but never more than 2 at once.\n\nMore than that, dump'em in a separate sub fully intended to thrive in that chaos.",

Not reposts from Twitter or random screenshots.

In that case, the community and the mods are either leaving artists to take commissions from other franchises or, for smaller artists, a single Reddit post can give them their first opportunity.\n\nAnd there is a BIG difference between casually showing art you made for fun and attempting to use your passion as a possible job.\n\nI think people don\u2019t care anymore since they have heard it so many times and forget people are suffering daily from AI taking over what could\u2019ve been their dream of having a creative job they enjoy.\n\nIf this is the \u201cBleach Fandom\u2019s\u201d stance, then I want no part in it.

Does she have a naturally perky chest, or is it the push-up bra? Does she have natural beauty without makeup, or is she just not wearing eyeliner? \n\nMy ex wore a lot of makeup, and honestly, it was kind of annoying. Any time we kissed, it always ended up all over my face. Trying to get dark lipstick out of a blonde beard is pretty difficult. Hell, I've hit it when she was just wearing the bonnet and a t-shirt.",

            "I\u2019m 37, and I know what natural means. Yoga pants can only do so much, and an effect more similar to sports bras in that they support via compression and lift. Push up bras, and excessive makeup are both lies, but still preferable to bodies being shot full of silicone.",

            "Not all cosmetic surgery results in abnormally sized breasts and buttocks.",
            "It doesn\u2019t make sense, does it? The hollow spot is their lack of heart, this is why they are \u201chollow\u201d (which becomes their mask afterward). Nel having her hollow spot in her actual heart is like she\u2019s hollow of heart in her heart\u2026 (maybe I misunderstood something) that\u2019s a weird creation choice \u2026",
            "Hollow holes aren't always their heart. It is the sport where their soul anchor was located when they were a simple soul. It was the thing that emotionaly tied them to the mortal world. The thing they could not let go of. And when the chain was ripped or disintegrated it left a hole where it was attached",
            "In Japanese the 2 meanings of heart are 2 different words. Kokoro and shinzou. Shinzou is the heart organ that keeps you alive. I\u2019ve seen kokoro be translated as mind or head in some iffy translations. Because it doesn\u2019t mean your beating heart. It\u2019s your heart as in like your soul or will that\u2019s what hollows lose. Most of them probably still have a physical beating heart.\n\nSo nel\u2019s organ heart could be her source of loss of her \u201ckokoro\u201d heart. There would be no confusion in Japanese because hollows lose their kokoro and nel has her hole in her shinzou."
