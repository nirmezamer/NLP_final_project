        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nA few weeks ago, we\u2019ve updated our ruleset and we\u2019ve realized we haven\u2019t officially announced these changes. So here we go!\n\nWith the series now finished in both manga and anime, we expect this to be the final rule update, unless a new project in this universe is announced somewhere down the line. While the activity will inevitably go down over time, we still want to keep this subreddit active as a place to discuss and enjoy everything surrounding this franchise.\nYou can find our updates rules in the sidebar, as well as our extended rule explanations and information in the [Full Rule Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/wiki/rules). \n\nSince the series has concluded, we've removed most of the spoiler rules, revised other miscellaneous ones for an updated definition, and removed any that didn't seem applicable anymore (such as the Fan Ending rule). To summarise the most important changes:\n\n**1. Spoiler Requirements**\n\nAs the series has finally concluded, enforcing spoiler rules would become more tedious and run the risk of killing activity if we removed too many posts due to untagged spoilers. Due to this, we've removed the automatic spoiler tag on most flair, and we also do not require users to tag their spoilers anymore. Users are still free to manually add a spoiler tag to their posts, and we reserve the right to spoiler tag posts with very explicit spoiler images.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this: Rule Number 2, or the 'Spoilers in Title' rule will still remain in effect for the subreddit. This is to prevent first-time watchers and users who view this subreddit randomly recommended from being instantly spoiled on major plot events, characters or deaths later in the series. The second exception is in regards to intentionally sending spoilers to users who have made it clear that they are not caught up. Doing this will still result in an immediate ban.\n\n**2. Content Quality Guidelines**\n\nWith the series over, we\u2019ve relaxed some of our previous minimum content requirements. However, we do not want the subreddit to be dominated by low-effort memes, AI-generated content or circlejerks, so we do still require a minimum amount of effort put into posts. \n\n**3. Conduct Rules**\n\nOur conduct rules remain in place mostly unchanged. We still want this subreddit to be a place for good-faith engagement and constructive discussions. We don\u2019t want it to turn into a battlefield, and we don\u2019t want to embolden users who deliberately want to create drama and a hostile atmosphere.\n\nHave any questions/feedback on our new rules, or the subreddit in general? Ask below, and we\u2019ll try to help!\nShinzou wo Sasageyo!",

            "He wouldn't make it.",
            "Pieck and Porco\u2019s infiltration towards the end might not have worked as well as it did if he were in the right place. He would\u2019ve sniffed them out. Literally!",
            "If he survives past retaking Shiganshina then he probably could've sniffed the spinal fluid in the wine if he was familiar with the scent",
            "Depends, is it just them?, or is he basically replacing Levi in that situation?",
            "\"What if Miche survived till the time skip\" \"Put him nad Zeke in a forest\"\nI wonder Miche stayed with Zeke in the forest after attacking Marley as a guard. So Levi will kill him because Miche drunk the vine and Zeke turned him as well as other soldiers in the forest. Maybe original death was better...",
            "Nah I edited this cuz I messed up And imma get attacked",
            "If you put Goku Yamcha and a squirrel in a room, the Squirrel would still be considered the nr 2 on a power scale.\nMiche wasnt a Ackerman, doubt he could actually go toe to toe with them",
            "I was thinking that but would they have someone qa strong as him do that",
            "He might get killed but he's still second to Levi so he'll put up a fight",
            "I've thought of that too\n\n\nU think he'd be an abnormal Titan of some sort?",
            "He was on a house and got a horse chucked at him \n\nI mean like a forest like with Levi chased Zeke in",
            "An Ackerman would have hooked into horse and slice it in half given how busted their physical feats are. /J",
            "Pretty sure miche would have crept on the beast with Levi, with him taking down the titans from the other side",
            "If it\u2019s just them then 100%",
            "Yeah I realized that after bruh \ud83d\ude2d how did u see it, I literally edited it two seconds after. now they gonna know what I said",
            "Zeke is getting folded if that happened \ud83d\udc80",
            "It's good lol ngl I wasn't specific on what kinda forest \ud83d\ude2d"
