        "content": "Good evening, my wonderful team members.\n\nAs we've discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1co136l/pride_2024/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) among so many other threads, we know the Pride 2024 set is A: only making it to 50% of stores, and B: less than stellar, to be very mild. The point of Pride is not just buying rainbow stuff from a corporation, but sometimes that's all the representation someone gets to see. Representation matters, and our queer community matters to me *a lot.* I yell a lot about our lack of field representation, not to mention HQ having a shit system for getting feedback from the field for anything. \n\nLike I did last year, I wanted to make a place for you to share your reactions and feedback - communication restrictions into the field has been a major focus of my team and I on the Pride+ Employee Resource Group \"Inclusion Acumen\" team. (Formerly Team Member Advocacy). A big part of why I want to do this is because of how damaging poor communications can be, and how badly I am trying to force that message into the ears of the people who could do something about it. (Re: damage - last year, when we only found out about product being recalled ahead of set thanks to u/PrinceKido and a few folks. We have a whole ass chain reaction of events since that point, culminating in a fucking Equal ^(Ity) shirt design of all things.)\n\nWhat I did last year with your messages was post them in the Pride Plus Business Council Slack channel, so that all of the people across the enterprise could receive feedback from the field and understand how things were feeling. I anonymized the messages if there were identifying features, left in the cursing, and posted them into a thread with updates in the main channel every single time I put a new batch up. This is the goal again this year - even if we can't force them to suddenly make the collection for 2024 not suck, anything we do to shift the needle towards the right direction is real helpful. \n\nu/128Gigabytes u/JayUnderscore_ u/n1njaunic0rn u/SamNoche u/grumpyoldfartess u/BroIBelieveAtYou u/ElderEmoAdjacent ",

            "What I want to know is: does corporate really believe that pulling or watering down the collection is the only way to keep stores, TMs and profits safe? What has changed between \"we're keeping the bathrooms inclusive, go suck it\" and now? We handled angry, armed guests fighting over Purell and toilet paper in 2020... I can't understand why guidance couldn't have been issued like it was for Covid. Just let us set the merch and empower us to handle the idiots? \n\nI'm so extremely disappointed in not just the cave-in, but also the utter lack of meaningful discourse surrounding it. Not just for stores, but also for the artists/vendors, something I learned today on this sub. \n\nI've been an ally since the '80s AIDS protests, and I chose to work for Target in large part because of their track record of inclusivity. To watch, and inadvertently be a part of, this kind of spineless, greed-driven decision-making really, really bothers me. The protesters shouldn't be our target demographic, pun intended.\n\n(I need to change my flair. I came back last month after 4 years in another industry.)",
            "the pride collection this year feels so bland\n\nhalf the clothes coulda gone in a new day without batting an eye, and even the more overtly rainbowy things still just feel like they're hiding it, compare this years rainbow stripe lawn chair to last years full rainbow\n\nand there's not even bullseye it sounds like? no socks or flags!\n\ni'm glad my store has it but everyone i've talked to here has been shocked both by how.. meh the designs are and the fact its hidden away on the backside of an aisle with future collective, completely hidden from the entrance\n\ndoesn't feel out and proud at all, it feels like Target's pride is in the closet",
            "Just looked at it.  Super underwhelming.  They were starting to give ace recognition and they yanked it away.\n\n![gif](giphy|gfsQffBnuc6e096brx)",
            "I said it in the survey this year and I will say it again, it\u2019s not just about Pride; the rest of the heritage collections sucked this year and weren\u2019t promoted and they still haven\u2019t done shit for AAPI heritage on a wider scale. If they don\u2019t really want to do it, don\u2019t do it.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest in a line of collabs and LTOs that don\u2019t sell for crap. Who\u2019s misreading the market that bad?\n\nWith that said, why did they contract outside designers for Pride 2024 and then cut the lines last minute? They could have just done basic in-house designs like they did pre-2022 and not burned all that goodwill, if any remained. Just pick a lane.\n\n(I\u2019m in one of the stores that didn\u2019t carry Pride before 2021, and never had the full run. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re too tiny or too exurban.)",
            "I saw the collection online (and in store today) and... I was vastly underwhelmed. It appears to strive to be so inoffensive and bland that it's actually a joke. By my eye, it looked like more than half of the collection is... for pets. Whoever made the decisions for this year's curation clearly doesn't get what Pride means.\n\nI predict it won't sell and that will just give the higher-ups more ammunition to eliminate Pride from the sales floor.",
            "For me... I feel more endangered as an openly, proudly and loudly queer member of the team, than I did when hearing about bomb threats. \n\nThis choice of action gave power to the nastiest, cruelest voices imaginable. Why is that the group you want to appeal to? The folks with no human empathy or concern for human life and well being? That's the Target audience? We chose them above queer folk? Who have been pretty damn loyal to Target because once upon a time they stood for Pride and stood for inclusion, loudly and openly. \n\nI chose Target for how open and seemingly welcoming they once were when it came to the Pride community, now I can't help but feel a pretty strong sense of betrayal... but sadly not surprise. I don't know where we are headed but at this rate with these very clear and harmful moves, I don't think it'll be a good road we navigate along.",
            "It feels...shitty, to say the least.\n\nI kind of figured that they'd kowtow to the bigots, but it still takes the wind out of my sails.\n\nI'm not out, but I'm also open about it (more or less). I've never bought anything, but I've always looked and admired. Hell, the Drag Queen Bird was \ud83d\udd25 last year, and if our store had any, I would have 100% bought it lol.\n\nIt always made me smile, seeing the display and the merch.\n\nA handful of years ago we had a really cool HR. She made Pride, Ally, Trans, and Equality Target pins and buttons. I've worn my (Pride) one every year, despite getting called the F Slur on a few occasions, it felt nice to do.\n\nLooking at me you'd never suspect in a million years that I was part of the community, but it always felt nice to show my Pride when and where I can, in my own way.\n\nI don't know how to describe it, really.\n\nThis year though...I feel it might be prudent *not* to wear it. Either because they're admonish me, or because of something a \"guest\" might do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yy0q1w643h3d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a12f479ca73807b6395cfd59d578a3ca73cd5ce3",
            "Great work!!\n\nI was reading the weekly update today and had a good laugh about how Target respects and supports its LGBT+ TMs. I sure as hell don\u2019t feel respected by anything the decision makers have been doing. They rolled over last year like dogs. Shameful!",
            "this shit is ugly af and wont sell and corporate will say \"well its them wokies\" and pull it entirely. it sucks so much as an lgbt team member who routinely has to put up with \"she, him, *they\"* every time i go into work and then to see target not only capitulate last year to alt right nutjobs but then to HIDE pride (at least in my store) and then make it appeal to exactly one demo (parents and friends of lgbt ppl) feels like a slap in the face. target pride was the first time as a child i felt like it was okay to be lgbt and i ROUTINELY wear my first pride shirt ever to target. it sucks that target is less lgbt friendly now then they were in 2015.",
            "Nothing in this year's pride \"collection\" has me excited about potentially getting it, like it has in the past. And having it tucked in the middle of the women's floorpad instead of in the gateway (and featuring more fugly swimwear in gateway, meaning more stuff people will buy 3 sizes/styles of and then return half of it 2 days later) feels like it's an afterthought, and it's really a slap in the face to LGBTQ+ TMs who are seeking any kind of support in an increasingly unsupportive world.",
            "I want to see PROOF of these claims about safety and historical sales.\n\nIf the decisions to pull back on Pride are in fact purely motivated by concern over profits and safety, then there should be plenty of paperwork showing they consulted people in market research, security, etc., and the decisions made are backed up by evidence and qualified experts. Team members are stakeholders in the company (even if we don't get paid dividends), we should be entitled to transparency.\n\nOtherwise, I am going to continue to operate under the assumption that the executives who made these decisions are just going with their \"gut\", which indicates at best incompetence and arrogance, and at worst active agreement with the hateful ideology of those who made threats last year.",
            "My store has a section right in the front, it\u2019s very small. But I can see almost everything from Guest Services. The first thing I saw was the \u201cMovie Star Bird\u201d and the only indication that it was a pride tag. I question a lot of things people buy when they return them, but who tf is going to buy this crap? And a silver car\u2026I walked by it today and it was very underwhelming. The Prince set and DVF were decent, but this is sad. My store seems to have a lot of queer+ TM and Target has a chance to celebrate that. But, per usual, we\u2019re either ignored or whatever this is\u2026tolerated? I don\u2019t know. There was a time when I wasn\u2019t a TM and I always thought highly of this place. But it\u2019s definitely lost its shine and I could feel that when I started November 2023.",
            "As an employee, proud is the last thing I'm feeling right now.",
            "As a member of the community, I personally don\u2019t have an interest in pride month merch, but WOW, this year\u2019s Pride line is disrespectfully small and bland. So low effort it\u2019s hilarious.",
            "We cut Pride down like crazy this year. \n\nBut GAHDAMMIT if you and yours are Swingers? WE GOT SO MUCH PINEAPPLE SHIT FOR YOUR ASS!",
            "My initial reaction to reading the little pride communication they put out on myday was to be kind of pissed they didn't even acknowledge last year's bullshit, but upon further reflection I'm kind of glad they didn't because nothing they would realistically put in that would really be anything other than bullshit. None of the LGBT team members at my store I've spoken with believe target pulled pride last year for TM safety, and most are of the mind that it actually made us less safe because it emboldened people. Moreover... target just really doesn't give a shit about store level TMs, no matter what they say. Our benefits are worse than industry average, the safety culture in stores is nonexistent IME, hours are constantly cut but expectations are always on the rise. Hell, during peak covid, HQ got to work from home, district leads got to check in on us virtually while store and DC still had to show up every day with an unenforced mask policy and a cart wiper who got pulled to do other shit as soon as they clocked in.\n\nThere are  signup sheets in my store for volunteers for local pride events that are completely empty, and I imagine they'll probably stay that way. Nobody at my store wants to represent target at a pride event after last year.",
            "Gonna go ahead and sticky this so that everyone can see it.",
            "I used to be happy to talk about the steps Target was taking to be inclusive. Now i\u2019m just so drained. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly disheartening to see how this is being handled. The set is smaller due to poor sales last year? Of course the sales were bad, everything was pulled and money was thrown away getting rid of perfectly harmless product. Target pulled product that wasn\u2019t even involved in the hate campaign. We\u2019re pulling due to safety concerns? How about do more to protect the employees. I don\u2019t see other merchandise being pulled that puts employees and other guests in danger (stanley, the pokemon card fiasco).\n\nHistorically, giving in to these kinds of demands only fuels more of the same. That\u2019s not an opinion that\u2019s fact.\n\nI\u2019m tired of empty promises.\n\nDo better by your employees, do better by your vendors, do better by the community.\n\nJust Do Better.",
            "I was genuinely, deeply disappointed. The collection is a whimper, a whisper in the back of a loud crowd. It barely counts as a collection at all - I felt like they had more for pets than people. If I can find better, more interesting pride designs at Old Navy of all places, Target has deeply failed. And deeply fail they did, with the 2024 collection.\n\nBut hey, at least bigots know that they can whine and wail and throw tantrums over their eyes being sullied by people who are not them existing and Target will knuckle under and show its belly.",
            "In addition to the pride collection being very lackluster and mostly feeling like repeat designs from years past, what hurt the most was the lack of communication about what stores were getting the set. VMs and Style TLs received no information about whether or not we were getting the set and can't redirect guests actually looking for it to nearby stores. It feels intentionally shady to not publicly post the store list or VMG on workbench unless you were on the store list. Communication from my SD was not given equally to all TLs, on a Wednesday when half of us were off, and refused to answer questions about it afterward.",
            "Obviously rainbow capitalism isn't the best, blah blah, but I remember being a younger teen and the only real representation I saw in my world was the Target Pride collection. I'm so disappointed that my store doesn't have it this year, and I'm disappointed in the collection in general. It is so good for kids to see this stuff and it makes me so angry that the homophobes are somehow winning. It feels representative of the general publica opinion on pride too... for fucks sake the first pride was a riot.",
            "I don\u2019t know, this isn\u2019t a single form to fill out to have my response shown to leadership at an undisclosed time. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want the C-Suite to think I wasn\u2019t taking their attempts to communicate lightly. :(",
            "it\u2019s super disappointing to see how small/boring the collection is this year plus the fact that they\u2019re only offering sizing up to a 2X for the pride merch instead of their usual size range for plus size :(",
            "Man this really sucks. Public spaces in general have been feeling a lot more hostile towards LGBTQ+ people the last couple years and Target was one of the few places left that felt safe to shop at, especially for Trans folk. I just visited my local one a few minutes ago and all they have now is a bunch of super lame US flag clothing where the Pride stuff used to be. \n\nSo disappointing.",
            "Is the Pride Plus Business Council there to advocate for a more appealing product design, or to advocate for TMs? I'm confused.",
            "June Follow up: My store actually has some of the Pride items... but hasn't put any of it out on the floor, but is just leaving it to languish in the backroom. Rumor is that the SD or the district manager said \"don't bother.\" \n\nI'm curious how many other stores similarly haven't put out any either.",
            "My store didn't get the Pride collection. Only two stores in our district did.\n\nAnd there's something else I noticed. We don't have a Pride playlist playing this year. Target is really pulling back.",
            "I have been with target for 10 years in November, I have seen a lot of change and growth but after last year I lost a lot of respect for this company. I truly understand the fear of the threats, the violence, the harassment, that we must protect our team. But with the actions that were made it didn\u2019t protect the community that Target was suppose to be supporting. It hurt me personally as a gay man to have to pull majority of last years collection, I cried while removing it from the floor while my peers tried to support me the best that they knew how. Target was an \u201cally\u201dto so many of us but at the end of the day the share holders call the shots. When we lose ally\u2019s the community is targeted more and we need the support more then ever. Target should have stood with the community and let all of the stores get the collection, My store unfortunately was one that did not receive the collection. I was officially told two weeks after the vmg was released, even though I already knew since the VM group had been posting about it. Why wasn\u2019t there more communication?? It was hurtful and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only LGBTQIA+ TM who was hurt this way. If target was a true Ally they would have backed the community, not pulled the collection last year, and actually celebrate Pride not diminish it. Very disappointing.",

Hopefully my complaints didnt fall on a deaf ear.",

Our team members are objectively less safe than they\u2019ve ever been and we\u2019ve done nothing to provide any sort of secure environment.",

            "Honestly whoever is making the Pride decisions doesn\u2019t understand how *retail* works. \n\nLike I\u2019m never going to assume any corporation cares about me, I\u2019m not naive. But how can Target have absolutely no idea what our consumers want, or that burning bridges with brands eager to do our marketing *for us* is a bad idea?",
            "\u201cWe chose them above queer folk?\u201d I love this bc yes, Target chose them. They did not do this out of concern for our safety or care for the queer community. They decided that enabling bigots is a good financial decision. And now that affects me at work because these bigots are now brazenly saying vile shit instead of just muttering it under their breaths or keeping quiet.",
            "it\u2019s the group they want to appeal to because it\u2019s the demographic that gives them the most profit. they are a money-driven cooperation, it makes sense- it\u2019s a business that only stays afloat based on its customers. who are the main customers/demographic they get in and need to cater to? lower class right wingers that have the homophobic opinions they do that made the bomb threats, other threats and complaints, etc. Target sees majority of their sales from the typical stay-at-home mother shopping with their children, usually the same group of people that have been obsessed with Stanley\u2019s, Starbucks, etc. thus they cater to the group where the majority of their support comes from which are these mothers that are more often than not, more traditional with their views, including homophobia, and chances are their husbands are in the same boat as them in terms of beliefs which gives more profit to Target when these parties see the company go against what they are too. while i don\u2019t agree with it, i can make an understanding why they went about the shitty decisions they have. they don\u2019t want to lose their main consumers, and if that means not supporting the minorities that need or could use the support, you bet Target is gonna look out for themselves on this one.",

            "I did Security for Seven years before I found my way to Target. I ended my career with my last assignment lasting three years, and I served as Head of Security at a Medical Marijuana Dispensaryfor the nephew of Freeway Rick on the east side of OKC, OK. \n\nI tracked the Far Right this entire time and have been doing so ever since. It\u2019s still a Hostile place for LGBT folx, America. It\u2019ll continue to be this way until the masses leave their ignorance and accept others for who they are. \n\nI can say that I have effectively ZERO confidence in any of my Leadership at [REDACTED] to handle a mass shooting at our store or even a mass attack of some other sort by an individual or a group of individuals banded together as bad actors. I say that I have zero confidence because I\u2019ve already been shown what our Leadership Culture is like. I\u2019ve observed a coworker looking like SHIT like they\u2019re about to pass out on the floor while HOLDING THE SHELVES TO KEEP THEMSELVES UPRIGHT and when I told my supervisor about this his response was, \u201cThey\u2019re not one of mine, I\u2019m not worried.\u201d Meaning they weren\u2019t working under my supervisor like I was. \n\nHow tf could I ever look to anyone else on that same Leadership team to take charge and control chaos in the event we\u2019re at work and SHTF? \n\nThe culture between team members? It\u2019s so inherently toxic that in the event of an attack in our store, I\u2019d not give af about any of them. My focus would be on getting MYSELF out of the store before the cops even show up to respond. They try to catch each other up with Leadership, and they listen to everything you say just to twist your words and run tell a leader or something.\n\nTo help myself mitigate risk to my Life, I plan on carrying my own IFAKs in the store every day this next month. They\u2019re loaded with Gauze, Tourniquets, Chest Seals, Decomp Needles, Etc. If I get hurt and I\u2019m not dead yet, I can treat myself if my injuries haven\u2019t killed me yet. Whoever makes it out of the store and into the parking lot after being injured/wounded? \n\nI can treat them as long as we\u2019ve moved a far enough distance to get tf away from the threat. I would not begin care under fire while I myself have no arms by which to respond appropriately, or others around me returning fire to provide cover while we move to a better position away from the fight. \n\nI have ZERO inclination to stay inside a building and treat wounded during an active threat environment in which the only weapons I\u2019m allowed to carry are the red/green PHC blades we are given or any item I can pick up off the shelf. \n\nHow much adequate Cover do people think is inside a Target store? Fun Fact: There is NO adequate Cover from incoming fire INSIDE the building. Rounds will pass through product and shelves and tumble into bodies. There sure is a lot of Concealment in the stores, but concealment doesn\u2019t stop incoming rounds from passing through at all.\n\nI have also considered wearing soft armor (concealed\nKevlar) under my uniform all month long at work considering I still have it. \n\nI don\u2019t even love that far away from where I work, but I\u2019d not think it wise to keep my battle rattle in my vehicle to respond to mass violence in a sundown town while being a brown man. \n\nTarget keeps basic medical kit shit. They do not keep stomp bags of trauma gear for events of mass shootings or mass attacks inside theirs stores.\n\nTLDR: After doing Security for seven years in some rough shit, I\u2019ll pick and choose what risks I take and for who I put my life on the line for.",

            "Interesting. At the risk of sounding hypercritical: it seems - from my very small seat at my very small table in my very small store - that the right hand and the left hand aren't talking, or even in the same room, or on the same floor, or in the same building. Generally speaking, in my HR role, it feels like Stores are thrown crumbs as an afterthought when it comes to any DEI&B initiatives and that the vast majority (if not all) of the DEI&B efforts are focused on HQ. \n\nI want to say that I understand and that it's more than an uphill battle to create cultural programming and provide tools to a company's entire frontline. And it is hard work, there's no doubt about it. But it is possible, and requires active, year-round advocacy, allyship and buy-in from C-suite executives. Those in roles of visibility need to more than just buy in to the cause, they need to walk the talk and be active allies, year-round.\n\nAnd, from my very small seat at my very small table in my very small store, it's hard to see that happening.\n\nThis isn't to undermine the importance of the work the Business Councils are doing. Your efforts are crucial, and I acknowledge that we wouldn't be where we are today without them. However, it's becoming increasingly challenging to link these efforts to tangible successes when TM's feel marginalized by decisions that seem to exclude their culture or subculture. This doesn't feel like a success. If it weren't for my Store Director (SD) proactively and independently countering this by involving us in volunteer opportunities and directly supporting LGBTQIA+ TMs and the community, several TMs who identify as LGBTQIA+ or are active allies had planned to resign in protest of how Target is handling this issue.",

I'm the ONLY stores TM who holds a leadership position on the business council/ERG - because I'm a PML, I have slack and Yammer and email and can actually communicate with the HQ folks. \n\nI have been with the council for two years (since becoming a PML), and \"don't leave the stores behind, what the hell\" is my loudest ask for them, and is one of my driving goals being in a leadership position now. \n\nWe've made a few positive changes, but it's all systems and backend stuff - nothing to make the LGBTQIA+ TMs inside our stores feel seen and heard and like, on the day to day.

There was absolutely zero effort ever made to acknowledge the contributions of store employees to DEIA efforts or the inordinate impact of making those investments at the store level (disproportiontely Black, female, food insecure, etc according to all company level surveys).\n\n\nShortly after I left she became the head of HR for another \"Look how progressive we are!\" company with a similar track record for screwing over store employees. All these corporate types live in their own bubble of privilege. This one zoom called me from the beach in San Francisco so I could talk to her about how dangerous working through Covid was for part-time employees with no benefits...",
            "It\u2019s not too late to get ANYTHING! \n\nI EDC most things aside from my pistol while at work.

Depending on the state of the store\u2019s floors and the environment immediately around me, I\u2019d either try to get a kill or just dip tf out. \n\nI was homeless for a year and a half, and I was ready to die a long time before that.

            "Full send on this. I love getting to show comments like these to the HQ folks, because a HUGE issue has been communication gaps - which means that even if they were walking the walk, no one in the stores would be able to see it.",
            "I think it bears to note that the Pride+ BC doesn't have any actual \"power\" in this situation. We have no control over what the Leadership Team does to make changes in store policy and merch inclusion. We can make recommendations, we can bring pressure, but at the end of the day, we have no actual power in the decisioning process. All of the anti-LGBTQIA+ progress decisions made last year and this year are entirely in the Leadership Team's court, and Pride+ can only watch in horror as it happens.\n\nThis also includes any avenues we might have to communicate with store TMs. There's a lot of content we would love to share with you, and a lot of feedback we would love to hear from you as well, but there doesn't appear to be a good avenue for this information to be transmitted in either direction through the company routes. \n\nOne thing I can note is last year's actions were NOT motivated by store safety or TM safety concerns (though we're always concerned, there were NO security-related incidents that spurred the actions of last year). It was purely about not losing big\\*t money. And I suspect that's this year too, that they don't want \"that sort of people\" being upset by a Pride collection \"in their faces\", and that Target would follow InBev (Bud Light) with losses in revenue for the year. \n\nGotta pay the stockholders, ya know :(",
            "I'm slowly learning that this may be the hard reality at Target. Without disclosing too much info, I have experience sitting on the inaugural board of one of MANY affinity groups while working at the world's largest \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Our DEI&B efforts mattered there. Cultural celebrations were a \"frontline first\" occasion that spanned every single location across the company. I am seeing that this is not the way everywhere, and it's really disappointing.\n\nThat won't stop me from trying everything within my power to make my store a place where every. last. employee. belongs and feels that sense of belonging and celebration. But I won't bark up the chain to make changes.",
            "Update: I was told yesterday I cannot have my bag on me on the floor or in the back while unloading trucks.

I don\u2019t have band-aids or neosporin. I have chest seals, so in the event of someone getting shot or stabbed in the chest and they\u2019re still alive with tension pneumothorax I can take that seal and keep \u2018em good till they get to a trauma center. I have so much gauze that I can not only effectively PACK blown out/deep wounds but also wrap them for compression. I have OLAES Modular Compression bandages with Hemostatic Cups. I have tourniquets enough for three people to have one on each appendage with a backup for each of those tourniquets. (decomp needles I left at home because \u201csharps\u201d) If an associate takes cover behind a glass panel and gets glass shards in their eye, are you gonna wrap one or both eyes? It\u2019s both eyes. Always wrap both to restrict movement as much as possible to keep shards from cutting and digging further into your eye. How about a neck compression bandage? Someone gets shot or stabbed in the neck and they\u2019re still alive but losing blood, do any of y\u2019all know how to apply a compression to a neck wound safely???\u201d \n\nManager: \u201cThat seems like a lot that we don\u2019t really have equipment for.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cWhich is why I want my medical gear. Leadership has already shown they can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll put a call in to corporate to talk to HR Monday afternoon.

            "Yeah, any and all of our power is fully granted to us by the LT, and can be stripped/throttled at their whims. Not ideal, but it's what we've got. \n\nAlso, hi! Welcome to my reddit existence.",
            "Update: Just got off the phone with corporate HR and they told me I can\u2019t have either a bag or medical items on me in store while working. \n\nTo be clear, I was told we\u2019re all on our own while on the clock. We\u2019re not allowed to carry anything that can save our lives in the event of a shooting, stabbing, or attack in the store and we become a victim. \n\nThis further solidifies that I can\u2019t trust anyone even at work, or the people for whom I\u2019m working when it comes to matters of personal safety. \n\nI\u2019ll still carry my tourniquets, but I\u2019m not staying inside the building if shit pops off, and aim definitely not staying around to look after anyone either."

            "Just did it now. For everyone who wants to try it, it's the first option you see when clicking on your name in the top right and myDay app",
            "Or just don\u2019t sign into any \ud83e\udd13",
            "Yo, I would love to just pick \"potential INF\" batches. I actually enjoy going on the hunt for stuff.",
            "I do this, mostly so I don't feel overloaded by the sheer numbers on the home screen lol. But I still get calls for style, food, pharmacy, the whole nine yards even though I work in tech.",
            "Sure, those work.  But regardless of how you reach the screen that shows you where the item is and asks you to scan a location, it would be nice to have a one tap option to remove it from one of them.",
            "And leads would probably be seeing TMs messaging about non work stuff and have to go have conversations with them.",
            "I think some people just don't like talking to the whole store? \n\nI have to go on walkie so much that it stopped bothering me but ik lots of people who hate it",
            "Exactly I don\u2019t have the keys o I can\u2019t help anyways! I always hang up the phone call whenever I need to use my device which is often lol",
            "The new zebras do not have built in RFID at Target lol we have the new zebras and we wish we didn\u2019t have to connect the shitty guns",
            "Not just leaders, anyone can log into MICKRA. No special permissions needed, and in theory you could do what OP wants even if it\u2019s not exactly kosher lol.",
            "I\u2019ve misplaced my device before (and then found it) but asked my leader if they were able to ping it and they said no. Maybe only some people know they can do this? I just wanted it to play a sound like you can do with a smartphone.",
            "'Reprocess'.",
            "First time it sends the call to everyone signed into that department, then when it times out or everyone declines it sends to the entire store except for leaders and AP, the third time it sends to leaders. It\u2019s documented on workbench somewhere.",
            "Why the stockroom aisles don't match the floor... drives me fucking crazy.",
            "Sometimes yes - but it\u2019s faster to scan. I also have carpal tunnel and typing on the device is triggering so if I can avoid that I do",
            "To be fair and recognize my own dumbassery...\n\n... I just realized your post literally starts with\n\n\" I work GM and...\"",
            "Correct!",
            "Or something similar to how fulfillment can go to a list of items in the batch. If the pulls would let you go to a list and select an item to where it would then continue from that point onward.",
            "thats not possible, you are signed into your area by default and are required to select at least one area when switching\n\nI always pick the doorbells",
            "I call the scavenger hunts and while they frustrate me. I also love it.",
            "When I came from Walmart I was surprised it wasn't a thing.  When an item was INF'd (a nil pick in Walmart lingo), it would drop into a batch for an exception picker.  It would auto approve an INF where the on hand is less than a case with no recent delivery or backroom movement, but anything else a second set of eyes would try to find it.",
            "That might just be that no one else is picking up, tbh.",
            "ya, what I end up having to do when removing items is set the inventory to 0, push what I need, and then re-enter the remaining inventory items again. too inconvenient",
            "Huh maybe so. I do have to talk on it a lot for my position so maybe I\u2019m just used to it",
            "It makes a loud sound like a lost iphone lol i think only high leads can do it, we rarely ever have to/do",
            "Yeah, that's it, that's the word I was looking for.",
            "Long days are work\u2026understandable!",
            "Oh is that new? (Haven\u2019t worked at target for a few months now.) before I never signed in. Some yea, they\u2019d automatically sign in but not all the zebras did so I never would sign in for any calls\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\nBut that\u2019s smart to pick the doorbells Oml",
            "My stores leaders apparently have a hard time responding and we have to call out multiple times for them to even respond",
            "Even just to ping them",
            "Does it say \"Find Me\" or something like that on the person that is getting pinged?I had this happen the other day and no idea why.\u00a0",
            "I do this daily so I know it well \ud83d\ude02",
            "It used to let you sign out on the phone app and then they updated it so now random devices are always signed out so I try to get those ones \ud83d\ude2d"
