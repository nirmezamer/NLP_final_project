            "Definitely true, which is why I never said they should be buffed. I think they are mostly weighted fairly. Just if anything, we shouldn't nerf All Of Flow Aim because 170-220 BPM +HR streams have nothing to do with the speed meta.\n\nIt's late and I don't remember when the speed buff released, but I swear most lower BPM flow aim maps stayed around the same value both before and after speed buff anyway. Sidetracked Day HDHR is still high 900, Songs Comp is still around 1000pp etc.\n\nWould gladly have my memory refreshed on all of that, honestly",
            "Agree to disagree. Every skillset has their set of easy farm, and I could easily point you to tons of low BPM flow aim maps that would be very hard, just as I can with any skillset. I can also point to DT farm that gives 900-1000pp, and these often share a similar amount of FCs to the 900-1000pp HR flow aim maps.\n\nMy thoughts are that devaluing a skillset to its lowest point of farm is completely biased and ignores any actual effort that someone might put into their skillset. People have honestly become kinda toxic towards flow aim in recent times due to speed meta, and its just sad to see. Same thing happened with aim back in the day, and it wasn't any more fun then.\n\nUnless you're a top player, there's no chance you are HDHR FC'ing Sunless Dawn, Sayonara, Inside the Winter Storm, Road of Resistance, or any of the other 900-1000pp flow aim maps, and there's a reason most of these only have a handful of FCs. That's just my opinion, though.",

            "no, I said raw speed is (majorily tbh) fine. Flowaim adds to speed difficulty which makes speed seem overweight, but its just the combination of flowaim and speed that produces such high pp values. Take aetrna's ATH as raw speed score. Imagine how much pp it would give if it were more spaced like usual farm maps. Still no one comes even close to his score on it because raw speed without quick flowaim pp boost is already hard as it is",
