        "content": "Dear r/NonPoliticalTwitter,\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve never interacted with me, I am u/Aspect-Infinity. I\u2019ve been a member of the r/NonPoliticalTwitter moderator team for almost a year now. The opportunity to address you all for the first time on behalf of our team is a humbling honor. \n\nI want to talk to you about some very valid questions that have arisen throughout my tenure here regarding our rules and how we enforce them. I\u2019ve taken note of as many of these questions and concerns as possible so could escalate them to the rest of the team for discussion. This announcement is the result of that discussion and I\u2019m glad to issue some much-needed clarification on what we consider political content, what we consider inciting political discussion, and how we\u2019ve taken steps to address it. \n\nThis is gonna be a long thread so I encourage you to grab a snack while I go over this rule-by-rule. Let\u2019s begin!\n\n**\u201c 1. No Politics or Political Discussions/Commentary. - That's the point of the subreddit\u201d**\n\nThe most important and sacred rule we hold dear as a community. It\u2019s a reflection of why this subreddit was created in the first place, to create a space similar to Twitter where public discussion can flourish, without the toxicity of politics. One of the questions that has arisen is \u201cWhat do you consider political content/commentary?\u201d, and so, we\u2019re providing an answer to that.\n\n**We define political content as anything that has the potential to ignite political discussion, commentary, or discourse**. This potential is taken into consideration when we believe the content in question can be intentionally viewed through a political lens. \n\nLet's break it down further. We consider political commentary to refer to comments that try to insert a political angle where none existed before, or that shift the focus towards a political interpretation. We consider posts, comments, and even usernames as \"content\" within our subreddit. \n\n**Directly/Indirectly referencing political figures, policies, or movements:** \n\n* A tweet comparing two political candidates with derogatory and inflammatory labels\n* A post expressing strong opinions on a specific government policy and calling for action.\n* A comment on a non-political post that attempts to connect it to a political event or movement, regardless of relevance. \n* Posting a tweet sharing news articles about political events with clear commentary promoting a specific viewpoint.\n\n**Posts or comments encouraging debate or argument on political topics:** \n\n* A post asking users to choose sides on a contentious political issue.\n* A comment starting a debate about the merits of a political ideology.\n* Sharing controversial political cartoons or infographics designed to elicit strong reactions. \n* Encouraging users to vote for a specific candidate or party.\n\nStill confused? That\u2019s alright we have some examples! \n\n**Example A: (Non-Political Content)**\n\nA post containing a tweet memeing a celebrity known for their political views doing something funny. The humor focuses on the action, not their political stance. \n\n**Example B: (Political Content)**\n\nA Redditor makes a post with a tweet that features a masculine, caucasian man with a MAGA hat and a shotgun with the caption \u201cThis guy isn\u2019t playing with those liberals\u201d. This would be taken down because its primary focus is political (particularly the Second Amendment). \n\n\\--- \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that we don\u2019t consider tweets focusing on sexuality, gender/gender identity/gender presentation, religion, or nationality inherently political. Although, should a subtext be present that is political we will take action. \n\nWe hope this clears up our stance and intention behind setting these rules in place, we encourage anyone with any questions to comment below, and we will respond. \n\nHappy New Year to you all!!\n\nYours,\n\nThe r/NonPoliticalTwitter Moderator Team",

I am constantly sharing content with family, friends and others. I always seem to find something that picks me up. You have made some dark times better.",
            "This. I mod a small sub, r/Eevee to be exact. Just recently, mods decided to, and I quote from another moderator and a user on the sub, enforce \u201cmartial law\u201d >!not political lmao!< in order to get posts back in check. We were too nice about the NSFW rule and it caused a lot of trouble, though the full story doesn\u2019t matter here (if you care enough feel free to ask I guess lol, no offense otherwise).\n\nIt\u2019s what I imagine being a middle school teacher is like, people trying to cause trouble just for the sake of it. Sometimes, strict rules are just the best because if you give an inch, they won\u2019t take a mile they\u2019ll try to take the whole sub, and it\u2019ll ruin the fun for everyone. Hell, it\u2019ll ruin the sub for you because moderating posts from rogue users sucks. Ever since we banned a single person, everything has been easy, for mods and for users. Good job at the fight for keeping this an innocent safe space, even if some think it\u2019s strict! It\u2019s nice to have a place to hide from the world, yaknow? \n\n~ Eevee Mods",

            "> we don\u2019t consider tweets focusing on sexuality, gender/gender identity/gender presentation, religion, or nationality inherently political\n\n\nStrong disagree, if you're still taking input. Tweets focusing on those topics often involve people's socio-political views.",
            "I honestly have a ton of respect for the mod team on this sub.\n\nHonestly, it astounds me how many miserable redditors come to this sub and try their hardest to weasel around the rules and make the discussion political.\n\nI'm tired of mods who claim to be non-political and then also defend politically charged posts because \"this clearly isn't/shouldn't be political (and also I agree with it) so it stays up\"",

            "Thanks for this. This is one of the best subs of Reddit at the moment in my opinion",
            "Honestly, I would take an even harder line. Though, to be honest, I don't have high hopes for the sub anymore, it's really hard to moderate because politics is a large part of the culture these days and it seems to me like there was an influx of new users the past year or so that lead to lot more political content being missed / ignored. Here are a few examples:\n\n[Legitimacy of bi women dating men](https://old.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/1890rrs/what_do_you_think_bi_stands_for/)\n\n[Capitalism's negative effect on city landscape](https://old.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/17681rg/europeans_cannot_comprehend_this/)\n\n[What men should carry to avoid being labeled as feminine](https://old.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/14iop95/carrying_anything_is_a_feminine_trait/)",

Sure, sexuality isn't inherently political or politically adjacent, but this twitter spat absolutely is.",
            "What about users with the Palestine flag emoji in their twitter names? Unfortunately that causes a reminder of politics and real world stress for some",
            "I agree with this but, \n\nIn your example, wouldn't the MAGA hat be the political item? A shotgun isn't inherently political lol",
            "Just wanted to say that I love you guys. I hardly interact here, but it\u2019s the sanest place on Reddit.",
            "I appreciate your efforts here. It's one of the only subs left that's continuously funny and not full of grandstanding or bellyaching.",
            "What is the stance on inherently political topics that are not technically political but are hot topics in politics right now? It seems anything to deal with transgenderism / transgender children / trans or queer pride for children ignites political discourse in almost every circumstance, yet it falls under sexuality and identity, which is not considered political? There are probably a lot more of those types of topics that many would not consider political, but unfortunately are now.",
            "Great job on the sub so far. I feel there\u2019s room to be even LESS political. Ideally, I\u2019d like to see no content which would rely on sexuality, gender, gender identity, religion, or nationally. A focus on more irreverent humor. Although these topics aren\u2019t inherently political, the decision as to whether each joke is political *is* political in and of itself.",
            "Thanks for this. I love that there's a space with no politics and I usually enjoy this sub. I'm glad for the clarifications.\n\n\nI am a teacher and last month I mentioned something about capitalism, which is an ECONOMIC SYSTEM, and was banned for a few days, which I felt was unfair. People talk about capitalism in a political way, but it IS, itself, an economic system and I don't think mentioning it should equal banishment. I do understand it can become a political discussion, but I was not engaging in a political discussion. I was talking about it as an educator. I get you don't know I'm a teacher, but I beg you to think about whether something is inherently political or not before banning people. I know it's a busy job to be a mod, so I definitely try to avoid potentially political topics in here now. I just hope this is something to consider. Thank you!\u00a0",
            "Deciding what is and isn\u2019t political is in and of itself inherently political. Ironic. \n\nNah jk I like this sub and I think the mod team is doing a great job for the most part already : )",
            "After coming back from Lemmy (literally everything, from top to bottom, is unnecessary politicized, no matter how unrelated it is), I appreciate the moderators of comedy communities more, specially this one and r/ funny. It's so easy to derail a comedy focused community into political rambling because \"everything is political\" or use a \"joke\" which is just clearly disguised propaganda. Some people are unwilling or unable to understand that no, I don't want to be bombarded 24/7 with politics and develop depression.",
            "Im a mod at r/politicaldebate, we could help your cause potentially. \n\nWe're partners with various subreddits like r/askmen and r/quityourbullshit as a outlet for political discussion, we could partner with you all as well. \n\nThey list us in their rule descriptions, something like \"no politics, if you want politics go here: r/politicaldebate\".",

            "A bit late to the party, but first and foremost, thanks for making this a great sub!\n\nOne thought I'd like to float to you guys: recently, there have been several times when someone's posted a screencap of some inane influencer/celebrity drama from Twitter with little or no context. This seems like it's tailor-made to stir up arguments and drama in the Reddit comments here when people are discussing it, usually because the influencer in question has done something especially heinous or stupid to anger a lot of people.\n\n\nThose drama-bait posts seem like they defeat the whole point of this sub, which the subreddit header describes with, \"Come vibe with us as we escape the stress of the real world around us!\" \n\nIs there any chance you guys can add a rule about not posting Twitter drama in here? Thankfully the mod team here has usually done a good job of getting rid of them, but I think it would help make your lives easier (and keep the sub a calmer place) if the rules specifically mentioned it. Thanks for considering it!",

Given the context we didn't believe the content in question would result in political discussion but we were prepared to moderate any instigating comments which we did ultimately end up doing. This was evident by the significant mod presence. \n\n  \nIn short, there was no subtext present that we determined was worth a complete removal. If the post had a subtext that was so significant we couldn't just take the conversation at face value nor expect others to do so we would've removed it for violating rule 1.",

            "It would be taken down for the shotgun because of the implications of the MAGA hat.

            "They have to have a hard, because, even if your comment is not political itself, the followings comments will get it to that direction \"capitalism bad, Am I right folks?\". Just like a meme or meme template with a politician can be funny by itself, the comments can turn sour pretty quick (bashing the politician).",
            "Thanks for sharing your experience, but I disagree with you on the capitalism front. As a team, we've seen when economic systems like capitalism or communism or just economic systems in general are mentioned it can cause rule-breaking behavior. \n\nI've looked into this situation a bit further and it looks like your comment spawned multiple political-based comments which is something we try to avoid.  As for banning, we often issue\"ban warnings\" which are warnings accompanied by a 1, 3, or 5-day ban to get our point across so to speak. That looks to be what occurred here, I wouldn't take it too seriously since you've seemed to learn from that experience.   \n\n\nFinally, we don't know the person behind the screen, and we genuinely try to look at it from their perspective. Even as an educator, we do not permit discussing content contrary to any of our rules even if it's in an educational context. For moderation purposes, it's simply easier that way and for that I'm sorry. But I hope you know we will consider your feedback when handling future situations like this one.",

Let's say the caption wasn't antagonizing, and there's no political subtext. In that case, we wouldn't remove it, but we may monitor it by using features such as crowd control so we can catch those pesky instigators. \n\nExcellent question and example, hope this clears it up.",

The average reasonable person probably isn\u2019t going to feel strongly one way or the other about the appearance of a video game character. \n\nBut some unreasonable people may get angry that a female video game character, like Aloy, for example, isn\u2019t attractive enough to them and turn it into a discourse with political overtones quickly. That doesn\u2019t mean the topic of Horizon: Forbidden West is inherently political. Most reasonable people would discuss its story or its gameplay, or talk about how the machines are neat or something. \n\nA loud minority will bitch about the main character\u2019s physical appearance instead, and make it political when it really never needed to be.\n\nSorry if this example actually veers into politics. I tried to keep it vague but I wanted to explain how a generally apolitical topic can be turned political when a loud minority of angry people gets involved, and how that doesn\u2019t turn the base topic inherently political.",
            "That would be allowed unless the caption or the post title is trying to frame it in a political context. If it's just as you described then we'd focus on the comments and deal with any instigators.",
