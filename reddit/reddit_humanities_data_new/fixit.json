        "content": "Hi guys \nI bought a Samsung fridge 3 years back. It's a side by side door fridge. \n\n\nModel no - RS82A6000SL\n\nGAS used - r-600a / cyclopentane)\n\nWarranty - 10 years warranty on compressor. \n\nHistory -  A week back fridge door wasn't shutting off properly so I called official service center. The guy came and opened the door hinges and concluded that \" hinges \" has been bent you need to use it like this itself or buy new doors. Technician didn't open anything  from fridges back. \n\n\nProblem - since past 3 days I have noticed that the fridge isn't properly getting cooled. Fridge has a digital thermostat where I can control temp. Minimum is - 23 c ( freezer ) and 5 c fridge. Both of it gets stuck at 1 c. \n\nThere's no icing or anything. This wasn't a issue at all before the tech came and tried to fix the door. The tech didn't touch anything backside of the fridge. \n\nAgain I registered complaint and a diff tech guy came and said your gas is leaking. I asked where is it show? He pointed to some copper thing and said here it's  leaking. I ask him again how do you know it is a leak? He said \" experience\" \n\n\nLittle background - \nIm from India and when I say official technician, they are not employees of samsung but they are authorised 3rd party companies that have tie up with local shops. These 3rd parties are nothing but local shops. They have huge incentives for selling \"gas' these people are proper scammers because they do the same with AC. Two times ac people tried to scam me by saying \" low gas \" when they come for free servicing. I straightaway tell them dont fool me I know this scam. They just simply shut their mouth. Even repairing is the same thing as fridge companies tie up with local shops.\n\nComing to fridge - I suspect these fridge  people are doing the same. I inspected the back of the fridge. There's some water in a tray like thing. ( Technician told me to let the fridge be turned off) And a lot of black dust.\n\n\nThe tech/samsung charges me basic 5$ for visiting. Now the tech guy said other guy will come and put in gas. Got a call from other guy immediately for filling gas. My suspicion grew so I told him to visit me later.\n\n\n\nWhat can I do troubleshoot this problem? And when the guy comes how can I technically tell him to show me how there's a gas leak? I mean logically I can say  show me gas leak. But this isn't a issue I'll manage but how can I troubleshoot the fridge guys? If it isn't workable by me then I'll have to argue with these technicians and call samsung phone line again.",
