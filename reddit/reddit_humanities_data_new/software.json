            "**Mouse shortcuts**\n\nEveryone know the keyboard shortcuts, but the mouse shortcuts are not well known and not many users use them, even if they could be more useful than keyboard shortcuts. Just some mouse shortcuts are known as extensions for web browsers, e.g. \"rocker gestures\".\n\nFor mouse shortcuts multiple combinations can be used:\n- button 4 + left/middle/right/wheel up/down/left/right\n- button 5 + left/middle/right/wheel up/down/left/right\n- right button + left/middle/wheel up/down/left/right\n- left button + right/wheel up/down/left/right\n\nIt's 25 possible combinations for 25 features, but some mouse shortcuts can be used as global, some just for 1 program, so they can be different in multiple programs, so it could be even more than 25 combinations (if the wheel tilt is available).\n\nFew examples for global mouse shortcuts:\n- Copy\n- Paste\n- Play/Pause\n- Seek Backward\n- Seek Forward\n- Back\n- Forward\n- Magnifier\n- Mute\n- Volume +\n- Volume -\n- Previous task (Alt+Tab)\n- Next task (Shift+Alt+Tab)\n\nFew examples for non-global mouse shortcuts, mostly for web browser, player, image viewer:\n- Previous tab\n- Next tab\n- Refresh\n- Reload\n- Close tab\n- Zoom\n- Speed\n- Previous file\n- Next file\n\nI think it's very useful, it's instant, 1-click, if using a wireless mouse, it can be even an alternative to remote control.\n\n[HotkeyP mouse shortcuts tips (my post with the specific tips)](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/10mt8v8/hotkeyp_mouse_shortcuts_tips/)\n\n[HotkeyP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hotkeyp/) - keyboard/mouse/gamepad mapper (free / open source / GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3) )\n\nMozilla Firefox extensions (free):\n* [Gesturefy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gesturefy/) - mouse shortcuts, mouse gestures, wheel gestures, rocker gestures\n* [Hyper Drag](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hyper-drag/) - mouse shortcuts, super drag, drag text, links, images to open in new tab and more\n\nGoogle Chrome / Microsoft Edge extension (free):\n* [crxMouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crxmouse-chrome-gestures/jlgkpaicikihijadgifklkbpdajbkhjo) - mouse shortcuts, mouse gestures, super drag, wheel gestures, rocker gestures\n\n[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - scripting language, alternative to HotkeyP, more complex, but not so easy to use (free / open source)",

It could be a bit strange for the first time, but later it's normal. Of course, it depends on the source.\n\n> *The human mind can listen to and comprehend words at a rate of about 210 words per minute, which is twice as fast as those same words can be spoken. 210 words per minute, or 2.0x is considered ideal for practiced speed listeners to be able to comfortably listen, comprehend and retain information.* [(source)](https://speechify.com/blog/speed-listening-techniques/)\n\nHowever, for me the speed 2.0x is too fast in most cases, 1.5x is quite optimal for most sources, of course, anyone can find their optimal speed.\n\nFor changing the speed keyboard shortcuts can be used, or even mouse shortcuts from the other comment and PotPlayer support also the feature to switch between last used and normal speed, for example 1.5x/1.0x.\n\n* [PotPlayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/) - video/audio player (freeware)\n* [MPC-BE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpcbe/) - video/audio player  (free / open source)\n* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - video/audio player (free / open source)\n\nMozilla Firefox extension (free):\n* [Video Speed Controller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/videospeed/) - Speed up, slow down, advance and rewind any HTML5 video with quick shortcuts",

On my laptop, I set four-finger gestures like this:\n\n* swipe left: play previous track\n* swipe right: play next track\n* swipe up: volume up\n* swipe down: volume down\n* four-finger tap: pause/resume playback\n\nThis is particularly handy, because I have set my keyboard to use \"standard\" function keys (needed for some applications I use). This means, that I don't have direct media control over my keyboard. The touchpad gestures conveniently substitute for that.",

days before Rashadat, this speech of Abdul Malik Shaheed was given in Bangla in a discussion held under the National Institute of Public Administration, Dhaka, which was translated into Urdu from the tape.\n\nfollows.)\n\nRespected president and intellectual friends! At present, the proposals of the new national education policy are being discussed here and the focus of the discussion is the theoretical basis of this policy, but I feel that most of the gentlemen who have spoken in this discussion so far have not discussed the topic under discussion. But while digressing, I have touched many unnecessary and irrelevant hands, so I will keep my speech short\n\nPart of the explanation of these irrelevant things is forced to spend. Some intellectuals have raised the issue of culture and said that their desired culture should actually be the \"Single Cultural Pattern\" emerging from Mies' intellectual dream of Marxism and in practical terms it should be an equal mixture of Hindu Bangla culture and Muslim Bangla culture. I submit that this claim is totally wrong, because Pakistan is built on common cultural values under Islamic thought and common culture never means a single homogeneous or monochromatic culture. A living society may have shared cultural values among more than one population, but trying to transform it into a falsely homogenous cultural commitment would be unnatural, and in this context, an unnatural example of imposing a homogenous culture on a society is the Soviet Union. Russia is Where all the cultural values were destroyed in the politics subject to dialectical materialism and created a homogenous culture. We do not believe in this way of thinking and behavior in principle, but our vision is to promote common cultural values in Pakistan.\n\nAnd as for what is the real purpose of education, the subject of Majlis-e-Masakra, then this\n\n\u06f3\u06f8\u06f9",

            "Haha. Thank you. But the truth is that I saw the closing parenthsis in your translation and though, \"where is the opening parenthsis?\" I looked at the image and immediately spotted it.
