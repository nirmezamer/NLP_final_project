            "When slacks is all that is basically left for leading investigations you know it's already over. Slacks cooking skill so weak he can't even use a microwave.",
            "They put state ids on government property for a reason",
            "Let the guy RP and see where this unit goes, You are already dooming and C.I.B hasn't even started properly yet.",
            "He forgot to drink his red bull before hand",
            "He actually had most of the story correct though?  Pigeon was flying the plane, Suarez was in the back and \u201cpushed\u201d him.  Tuggs and Cau were also involved but in lesser ways (assisting with the grab, and the pickup from Grapeseed Airport).  He got all four names but only had people willing to testify to Pigeons involvement.  Considering how little information there was, he actually did a decent job of putting together the story from bits and pieces of info.",
            "what? Coyote brought more investigative rp to the story than anybody else did in 4.0. People are just out there chasing cars. Did you even watch the lengths of interrogation Coyote went to in interviewing DOC? Tuggz was on the docket as a co-conspirator. And just admitting a crime in passing doesn't constitute evidence.",
            "Brother you are smoking something",
            "Nah that\u2019s just not true",
            "The main problem is Coyote is spending most of his shifts inside MRPD or SDSO investigating. In order to promote him they need to know he can do comms, patrol, and process on his own without his hand getting held. That's the entire point of the PPO phase. FTOs have basically asked for like a week of patrol just to prove he can do it on his own. You can be the best shot in the military, but if you don't know how to march in formation that's not gonna get you anywhere.",
            "you shouldn't be investigating full time when you literally can't do anything else appropriately yet.  You *learn* to investigate by learning everything else.  You investigate at traffic stops et al.  Once you have that base then you can start thinking about big investigations.  And no he wasn't the only one interested, but he got in the way of anyone else investigating...",
            "There\u2019s already precedent of this happening from the Tessa vs LSPD case. \n\nA judge can\u2019t just throw out an autopsy report of when someone died in a murder case, that\u2019s one of the most key pieces of evidence. \n\nPlus if the defence wanted to, they could point to the crime occurring hours before the autopsy report was created which would still put this case out of the statute of limitations by a larger time frame of 3 hours. \n\nBecause if Coyote added the report of when Aziz was kidnapped when PD found his car on the side of the road that\u2019s when everything began officially. Which pushes everything even further outside the statute of limitations.",
            "the autopsy was the best case for SOL.  By either time of infraction or time of discovery they were even more outside the SOL.\n\nAlso \"And what infraction did my client commit?\"\n\n\"murder\"\n\n\"what evidence is there that someone died\"\n\n\"....\"",
            "Basically anyone that was good at filing subpoenas and court didn't get rehired.",
            "It does not help that Slacks was basically his direct report for the investigstions - you know, Ssaab who is notoriously great in court /s.",
            "nobody else is even pursuing them. Nothing transpired from Rooker perma, absolutely nothing. At least Aziz perma had some roleplay come out of it because Coyote went around and interviewed a bunch of people.",
            "They have told him so many times to drop the case and/or patrol. He said he refuses to drop the case to at least 3 higher ups I saw.\u00a0",
            "He also told Bruno who\u2019s a cop as well, it was reported to Cornwood and Albert King was standing there when he took Bruno\u2019s report. And the same day hour later he got arrested with Windsongs gun on him, who he happens to share a house with. He\u2019s lucky no one\u2019s truly followed or \u201cinvestigated\u201d him in that way.",
            "If the testimony is directly from the person they admitted the murder to, it's not hearsay.",
            "30 days would normally be enough time, but the city was basically on fire for a month straight. The council shooting, Solomon and Ellie's supposed involvement, Aziz's murder, and Barry shooting Solomon all kind of happened in a 72 hour period. Then you have prison break and manhunt. Add in cases like Soze's and the constant kidnappings/shootings by CG taking precedent over these investigations, everything was slowed down.",
            "Tugz's twatted and told the cops to there faces that he killed aziz but the cops just seemed to ignore what he said....the pd is full of pog streamers and not streamers that actually want to rp the nitty gritty and go after the criminals..I honestly feel like this is a reason why the pd is not catching many criminals",
            "Slacks has no investigative background. Rip Riley and Kingsman have done more investigative work than Slacks has, Brian Knight has more drug busts in 4.0 in 1/100th of duty time than Slacks has. We all know how bad in court saab is. Saab has always been on the field guy, Slacks has no reason to be in an investigative unit let alone lead one.",
            "Doesn\u2019t prove she\u2019s the one who gave it to him when she\u2019s been kidnapped and robbed multiple times",
            "I mean having a guy who doesn't understand basic court stuff be a in charge of an investigation unit seems destined to fail",
            "He had 3 separate confessions from Tuggz, each providing more details each time but ignored it and it took him 30 days to get here, oh wait 30 days and 3 hours. Great work.",
            "I never said he didn't provide investigation rp, he's one of the small few that are, just said Coyote the character wasn't good at it.  At least not compared to how hyped up the PD paints him to be.  Big difference between what I said and what you're trying to say I said.",
            "I wish.",
            "I remember Crane bringing this up about Coyote trying to force this investigation role and looking into high profile cases but he isn\u2019t able to provide comms, street names, 10 codes etc and that he wants to see him out on the streets gaining experience to become a full officer first, which I completely agree with. It\u2019s almost like skipping the grinding part of a process and getting straight to the good stuff.",
            "You haven\u2019t watched much Peppo recently have you?",
            "Like who and how?",
            "Hayes is back, but I don\u2019t think she wants to deal with court stuff anymore.",
            "The thing with a lot of these cases is unless there is hard evidence it's very tricky to get a conviction. There was literally zero evidence that can tie anyone specifically to the Rooker murder. With Aziz, a bunch of interviews are good roleplay but unless they can put someone on that plane it would be impossible to prove in court. None of these cases had any probable cause, just a lot of reasonable suspicion. That's not enough for an arrest.",
            "He was repeatedly told to get back on the case by other high command bc no body was working it. One of the big reasons Coyote didn\u2019t finish it was bc he has been prioritizing patrol the last week",
            "Which is why NP isn't really set up for long investigations. Too much is going on, too many kidnappings and murder attempts. There hasn't really even been much vault activity this month. And the pay off for the investigation, you getting those people \"off the streets\" is getting them off the streets for like 2 days while they and their chats complain about being punished in real life. Even though while the investigation was going on there has been like 10 more kidnappings and 20 attempted murders.\n\nInvestigations are really only for people who really enjoy doing them.",
            "Indeed, but like circumstances like that do have to be considered and the reason why extensions of time should be something allowed for at least hut level cases like first degree murder, murder of a government employee.  Anything else below the hut stuff, would be like no extensions should be allowed for those things. That way it like remains consistent and not abused by the cops.",
            "It sounds like your saying there is only 1 person in the pd...surely there's not 200+ cops whitelisted in the server....the problem is streamers thinking joining the pd is a gateway to erp...the sooner 50% comes in with a senator character the better",
            "You think tuggz wouldve given them the murder weapon or what exactly do you expect the cops to do with that?",
            "Well, the cops maybe had no reason to believe him at the time. Some likely did but have no proof he did anything really.  Now the confession along with the video he took when Aziz was murdered at the hospital and his remarks fly high. Technically I think would make a case against Tugs the strongest. As there would have been professional witnesses to Tuggs admitting and doing this act. If it wasn't past the statute of limitations. I think they could get Tuggs. But like it would still be a hard case. But then the way the justice system seems to work. Likely would have just said guilty to it anyways. Giving the cops the victory depending on the judges involved.",
            "I know Saab absolutely wants to and loves investigative RP and interrogations, but I think he needs someone like Siobhan to sit him down for a few hours a day for a week of lawyer school in how the law in NP actually works. Else that department is going to be a laughing stock and DOA with the amount of dropped or dead end cases.",
            "It\u2019s actually longer than 30 days and 3 hours, that was just from the earliest submitted report. If going by the time the crime occurred, it was way more time than 30 days and 3 hours.",
            "The guy over various characters has had a command role in the PD since 2.0, and then in 3.0 basically became the defacto OOC mouthpiece for PD continuing to today.\n\nIf in 6 years of being one of the people in charge he can't understand fundamental legal concepts of a simplified constitution - no classea with Siobhan are going to help.",
            "The funny part is Saab would say to chat and even other characters in RP that he didn't believe investigating was worth it, due to limitations. I was shocked hearing him say he wanted to lead the unit because of that. It was until Dab became the Commissioner and gave them authority to go UC that Slacks started understanding what investigating was about, he liked it so much he transferred to BCSO to get the unit of the ground."
