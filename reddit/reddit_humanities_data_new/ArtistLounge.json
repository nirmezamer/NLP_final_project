No in-betweens accepted.\n\nThat approach DOES work for some people. Other people just incorporate what they're learning into their \"real\" art pieces and practice that way. Or some mix of the two. But certain people online aggressively reject anything but a very specific approach as qualifying as study or practice. Some of them treat these drills as more like a hazing ritual to be endured before you earn the right to draw something you find interesting than an actual effective learning strategy. For those types, the pain is the point.\n\n(I agree with you of course)",

            "Hahaha ok. Thats fine because I make a living with my flat earth art. I have sold to galleries and have painted over 50 murals so say what you want i dont give a fuck.",
            "You are going off on a tangent here. The person I responded to said there are no rules in art. I disagreed saying the fundamentals are the rules. Now if they had said there are no rules in how you make art I would have agreed. But that was not what they said.\n\nI suppose I could have conceded that yes people can make art without knowing the fundamentals. That\u2019s true. Is any of it good? Not usually. But they still use the fundamentals. Why? Because the fundamentals represent our breakdown of how humans understand visual language. \n\nEven five year olds smearing paint on paper have a sense of form and space. Is it good? No, cause they don\u2019t actually understand the rules. But we all have an inherent sense of what the fundamentals are and that is expressed in our taste for art."

If you are good at programming and know your way around pc people will ask for advice or want them to fix their devices for free.\n\nSo let this be a life lesson to value your time!\n\nno matter your skill and level. Only do projects that either pay you upfront at least half with a contract or you are absolutely okay to do it for free.\n\nBut don\u2019t sell yourself short. No ones time should be exploited. \nIf you do something as friendship favour ask yourself if that friend would do the same for you. Would that friend do whatever hobby they do for free for you.\nWould they give you their books for free because they are done reading? Would they come across the city to help you move for free?\n\nSome friend may be absolutely worth the effort because they already did countless of things for you. Bought you coffee or icecream just because they wanted to spend time with you and knew you were short on money. So sometimes if you want to make them a gift that\u2019s fine- but then expect that as soon as it leaves your hand they may resell it.  but if it\u2019s something they asked you to do - always put some kind of compensation and rules to it. \n\n\ni know we all fall into this trap because we believe they are better artists out there - and that\u2019s true they will always be better artist out there; but that doesn\u2019t mean your effort isn\u2019t worth appreciating. \n\nAfter all if it was easy why don\u2019t the people do it themselves? \n\nIt\u2019s still time, and recourses being used that cost you money and effort. And yeah, I hear you say : but I already have a tablet and the program and would use it anyway. But eventually it needs replacing, so it\u2019s not different from using traditional medium paint.\n\nAnd most importantly time has the most value here. Because time is something no matter how much you gain it will never come back to you. So don\u2019t waste your free time on things that don\u2019t feel good or rewarding after. \n\n\nI hope that helps :)\n\nGood luck on your journey onwards",

Not that you will magically better at one of those things, but looking at different parts of the existing world and observing them and drawing them contributes to your overall skill and might also give you some new ideas or just lead you a different direction when you return to what you usually work on.",

            "After glancing at your account, if you only focus on one thing to improve on - shadows and shading. The others are right, you should delve into basic fundamentals, which includes proper shading, but if you just want to focus one step at a time, that's what I would focus on first to easily see growth.",
            "Yup work on your foundations training, even manga artist- you can tell if they have had foundations training- you can just feel the sense of perspective, solid objects and believability in the poses and gestures. \n\nYes stylization is super fun. Art is about thinking- when you draw new things- and force yourself to draw say- complex things like a car why the part look this way to why things are solid or why all the lines converge.\n\nEven drawing a spoon in a glass of water- you have to notice the refraction of the light, the different thicknesses of glass- how objects distort behind the glass- through light science- these are advanced topics and knowledge you may not be there yet but just go out and have fun and study- them or whatever is most interesting to you- color, anatomy, perspective- gesture, mark making- form. \n\nArt is about thinking- when you are thinking about these new visual properties- believe me your drawings will change and get better reflecting your new found knowledge of the academic realism .",
            "A quick tip: Try to have the lines underneath a shape thicker, and the lines on top thinner. It's a cheat to some degree.",
            "To add to other comments, I want to also advise to try copying artworks you like. While you are doing that, you can analyse 'how it's done', using of lines, shades, etc.\nAncient artists learned that way too, don't feel bad about it. You must learn deeply from the nature & other artists' works first, to be able to break fundamentals (if you want) and to discover your own way lately. This is the way.",

            "Commenting as a complete rookie, but I think that's where I can help:\n\nLook at the work of someone you admire, and try to identify the main difference between your works.\n\nAt a glance, I'd say you could do with focussing on light/shadow. Not only does it create depth and detail, but it can quite often replace outlines entirely in certain areas.\n\nBe bold, be brave, try new things and never give up!",
            "If you do stylized art I would recommend the fastest way to learn anime art by Oridays on YouTube. I\u2019ve watched many videos and tried many things but what\u2019s special about oridays is that he really explains a way to learn art in a way that is applied in stylistic way which for me has helped a lot recently. I did many studies of anatomy and a lot of other things but I didn\u2019t see much improvement and oridays did help me realize a lot about why so I think if you are doing especially a more stylized type even if it\u2019s not anime in particular that video will help you a lot.",

            "Base foundation can also mean drawing \"through\" the form, considering and drawing out dashed lines of what your character, for example, looks like from behind, where the circular lines of their head or hip land behind them and behind what we can see in the 2D space.\n\nStudying basic principles of animation (books by Preston Blair) and learning to see your art in 3D to draw through the forms will help you solidify your style so your art can look professional.",
            "Study gesture drawing, anatomy, perspective, color theory, composition. Draw from life a lot.\n\nGetting good at visual arts is a shit ton of work. It is hard but rewarding.",
            "It seems you like drawing characters, so learning basic shapes and gesture drawing will give you a good boost, the benefit is that you would naturally try to apply your knowledge by drawing characters and you would be motivated to make them look good by learning more, so it's a good cycle. Buy yourself something like a Body-kun and Body-chan figurines, even knockoffs will do, this is to have a fast and tangible way to see a a general pose, basic shapes and perspective (check perspective lessons, and tie them into basic shapes). Don't try to shove everything into your head like anatomy, composition, color, but keep a curiosity about them. Don't bury yourself under constant lessons and learning hours, you would get better results by combining a bit of studying with drawing what you like while applying what you've learned to your best current ability, and try to jump higher with a next drawing. Don't forget to give your brain time to process and settle in the information, you would see improvements fast, but don't measure yourself in days and weeks, several weeks to months is a realistic pase of improving without rushing like it's a video game. Have fun",

            "I may be a bit late, but I'd like to offer a deep perspective.\n\nI think the true issue at heart is that you need self discipline and understanding of yourself and the things you create.\n\nAnyone can say, \"Improve fundamentals\" but what does that really mean at the core? Learning how to practice is a more valuable skill than practicing itself.\n\nThere have been many times I've seen a \"This is my progress over a year\" and to be honest, it looks like less than a few days worth of progress. The reason for this is because they have poor practice methodology and execution.\n\nThe first hurdle is investment. How often do you spend practicing? I don't mean drawing or painting. But more importantly, study. Watching a course or a video on design principles, and really looking at the major problems in your work. How are you expected to paint a figure in great light, with the perfect pose, incredible composition, and anatomical structure, if you don't understand the concepts on how they work? Break these fundamentals down and laser focus on them. Dedicate time to this process as it is a period of growth. The key is that you can accelerate that growth. Make your one years worth of progress one day.\n\nThe next step is what to laser focus on. Usually its the thing you dislike most in your work at the time. Don't like the lighting? There are experts that have made videos on understanding light. They are your gateway to understanding. Your wings to discovery. Once you see the process, can break it down, and apply it to your own work; your one year begins to quickly become one day.",
            "Idk if you watch Steven Zapata on YouTube but i recommend his stuff- especially if you enjoy drawing from your imagination. Imo- I really like that you seem to be working from your mind, and I think his advice and videos will help you not get locked in the fundamentals rabbit hole I see some artist get stuck.\n\nPersonal advice- your best pieces seem to be the ones with a limited colour palette. I think it\u2019s bc you have to think about light/ shadow and value much differently. I\u2019d encourage you to explore that more.",

            "\ud83e\udd14 so basically you don't like something about your art piece, which makes it so you're not satisfied with it and you describe that unsatisfying feeling as amateurish perhaps.\n\nDo you like the idea you had? Try drawing that feeling something arises more intensely, What was that feeling in the idea? Happy, sad, angry, scary, gentle, rough, intense, smooth, natural, unnatural, uncanny, pretty, cute, beautiful, emotional, cold, familiar, unfamiliar, powerful, weak, friendly...\n\nWhat color describe that feeling? Gentle and sad=blue\nAggressive and intense or deep= red\n\nWhat shapes describe that feeling?\nAngry,determined=pointy        soft cute gentle=round\n\nWhat things arise what feeling?\nScary= teeth, meat eating animals, sickness\nFriendly and cute= cats, baby animals, small things, chibi, smiles\n\nI'd build feelings of the idea first, only then I'll know what I want the skill level to be at and what it is exactly I want to do.",
            "People are saying you need to go back to the foundations, but that's not super helpful imo because you do have a relatively good understanding of figure drawing, design theory and anatomy but your art is really flat and stiff. I suggest practicing gesture, textures and most importantly foreshortening and perspective. I feel like you would benefit from that the most, but it also depends on what your vision for your art is."
