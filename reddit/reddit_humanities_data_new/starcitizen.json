            "I need help. I feel like I am being Gaslighted. Probably unintentionally but still I can seem to wrap my head around it. \n\nDuring the first day of Invictus week, I had a ship removed from my hangar, A Cutty Black, that I have had for 4 years. It was there at the start of Invicuts and prior, but ther was some kind of patch or something done and my ship disappeared from my hangar. \n\nNot only did this ship disappear in game, but it also disappeared from my account hangar on RSI website. I am certain it was there, because I looked at it before purchasing a Vulture, stand alone, on the website. \n\nIt was not until after I purchased the Vulture that I noticed the Cutty Black gone. Now, this seems cut and dry, but that Cutty was a reward ship, a bonus, that I got for a significant purchase 4 years ago during the first Drake day and release of the Kraken model and ability to purchase. \n\nI spent well over 300 dollars that day on a Caterpillar, which also came with a free Buccaneer. So I got a Cat, a Buc, and a Cutty Black all on the same day. I thought it was a great deal. I decided to sub to Centurian too, which gives me a Ship of the Month AND a consistant Anvil Arrow in my hangar. I thought, damn these are great deals. \n\nFlash forward 4 years, and not the cutty is gone, and all trace of that sale, the event, the invictus pdf on RSI website is down and gone. ANd I put in a help ticket for the missing ship. \n\nHERE IS WHAT I NEED HELP WITH: CIG has told me there are no instances of recieving free ships from any pledge. I should never have had the Anvil, the Cutty Black, nor the Buccaneer. I feel like I am being messed with. Could I -really- have misunderstood this for 4 years and just so happened to have had 3 free ships over wipes and stuff over 4 years?\n\nThis is exactly what CIG said to me. \n\n>Hello,\n \n>I had a look back through our announcements from that time, but I'm still unable to locate any reference for a promotion that would have awarded either a bonus Cutlass or a Bucaneer as part of a pledge, nor any reference to an Arrow that would be awarded for a Centurion subscription of any length. The only thing that does come to mind is that the Caterpillar does currently loan a Buccaneer, as a Loaner Ship. Due to the current restrictions in Arena Commander, certain ships have a secondary loaner to allow them to play in all game modes. For example, Freelancer owners would receive an Anvil Arrow for use in Arena Commander play modes. \n\nAm I crazy? I feel like I must be completely stupid.",

            "As someone looking at getting into Star Citizen, having played Elite Dangerous in the past, I am looking to understand about build crafting ship customization in SC. From my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong, currently when you want to outfit your ship in SC you can upgrade select modules to higher rated ones but every upgrade seems like it is better with limited to no trade off for the upgrade other than cost. In Elite, the different levels of the module had different benefits, like power consumption, heat generation, durability, weight, and etc; making each version of that module have a value, even from the highest value module. Then it could be further enhanced with engineering that used materials to modify the specific stats of that module. \n\nMost of the videos I have seen are from older versions of SC, or do not go into the module customization enough to answer my question. Is there something similar to that Elite Dangerous ship building/customization in game already/coming? \n\nFor example, I was looking at mining in SC and (correct me if I am wrong) it looked like there are two ships dedicated for mining, where as in Elite you could add the mining modules to most ships so you could make any ship you enjoyed flying a mining ship. Is there a way to do that in SC already/coming? \n\nThere is so much to learn about the SC universe I am slowly going through it all. I am excited to see it grow, it looks amazing. As I have watched many videos from RSI interviewing the different devs, I wanted to also thank them for their hard work and creativity. The game looks incredible!",

My playstyle is primarily solo, maybe on occasion I'd have a co-op partner and in the future group up, but definitely mostly solo.  Mission-type wise, pretty much anything that I can do solo is fair game.\n\nThe available choices are:\n\n* Reclaimer (industrial/heavy salvage)\n* Prowler (combat/dropship)\n* Ironclad (transport/armored freight)\n* M2 Hercules (combat/militar transport)\n* Ironclad Assault (combat/combined arms platform)\n* Merchantman (transport/heavy freight)\n\n  \nI'm already have and am pretty set on keeping:\n\n* Avenger Titan\n* Cutlass Black\n* Freelancer Max\n* Constellation Taurus\n* C1 Spirit\n\nAny thoughts Reddit?

            "Straying too off course in any of the major cities will issue you with a bright red flashing warning and a very short timer; however if you are in 3rd person camera mode, these warnings are not apparent. You have a total of around 15s to turn around and leave. Failing to do so will immediately have your ship be impounded.\n\nThis is not a crime, but you will have to pay the fines to have your ship be released.\n\nIt's best to look up image/video on city landing zones before approaching for the first time. Some locations can be very confusing at first.",
            "You may have not stopped completely (Hold X) when a space cop asked you to stop for a scan. You get an in-game call from the cop asking you to do so but that's sometimes bugged and you get no indication except a warning on the top of your screen saying \"Halt for scan\"",
            "I think this is what you ran into, I had the same thing a few days ago. If you were close to the platform but not at the spaceport, they probably charged you with trespassing. Any crime level below level three, you can pay an in-game fine and have it removed (3+ is shot on sight). Computer terminals at the security checkpoint after you land will allow you to see a list of your crimes and pay off the lower ones. \n\nYou'll want to stay away from platforms, or city street level, in your ship for major cities. You get a short warning although sometimes they're very short, so just be on the lookout and go slow near the surface to prepare to boost away from the ground if you don't know your not allowed near the city area you're going.\n\nAs for landing, when you're within 10km of the spaceports or stations, ATC will give you a heads up and you'll see text stating \"contact ATC for landing\" when you're near the place you can land. Spotting the city spaceport does take a bit of practice, while they typically have directional lights (red slow flashing, sometimes a ring or line of lights or a rotating white light) they easily blend into the city lights. There are YouTube videos to find these places that will show you tricks you can use to locate.",
            "To be in coupled mode essentially means that the ship and it's many thrusters will automatically keep the ship stable.  In forward flight it will keep you moving in the direction you're facing. When you let go of your inputs it will slow you down to a stop.\n\nIn decoupled mode will keep the same directional vector regardless of which what you're facing. If you think about going in a direction across a line you can stay on that line while rotating your ship without automatic inputs causing you to turn or slow. You can go from flying straight on from your nose to sideways or even backwards without deviation from that initial line.\n\n In decoupled there is no automatic system of thruster implementation. So if you're strafing left and let go of your inputs you will continue left until you manually oppose that with a right strafe input. You will continue on the vector unless you input the reverse direction or brake. You used to have to manually oppose gravity in atmosphere too or you'd fall out of the sky but,  now the default setting will keep you up on the same vector in atmo too.\n\nDecoupled is preferred for fighter pilots because it allows you to keep your nose on target and stay moving easier. The default key binding is Left Alt + C according to Google. But, I have it bound to sticks do I don't really know if that's accurate",
            "In 3.23, it's C to switch between Coupled and Decoupled mode. And Alt + C to use the new cruise control. These are the new default keybinds.",
            "Coupled mode is the default state, where turning your ship will automatically use thrusters to compensate for the turn. In essence, it's similar to how planes behave in atmosphere. **Where you look is where you go.** If you are going forward and want to turn around, your ship automatically begins to actively reduce your speed in the forward direction, such that once you have turned around, you are basically sitting still instead of continuing to drift in the previous direction.\n\nDecoupled mode changes it to (kinda) similar to how spaceships behave in space, where you can turn without affecting your forward momentum. If you are going forward and want to turn around, you can spin your ship 180 faster than you can in coupled mode, but your ship will not be slowing down automatically, instead you will maintain your previous forward (now backwards) motion, and will have to manually fire your thrusters to change where you are going.\n\nDefault keybind is left alt + c to toggle in between.",
            "You have the right idea. There should be an option out the left of the canopy. It might be a little higher than you expect? It's not a modeled button, rather a floating square you won't see unless you hover over it.",

Right now there is a dynamic event, it\u2019s taking up some bandwidth so if you are thinking of stopping by then I would recommend waiting a week or two more until that\u2019s over. When you get back in make sure to get your upscaling going and stick to DirectX unless you have a very poor system setup. There are obviously still plenty of bugs but the consensus has been over the past few months that it\u2019s more stable than it has ever been, even if you get some lag from time to time.",
            "Hull C is ok but docking is not. It has not been working since last year so using the ship is a big gamble. \n\nThe rest of cargo running is mostly doing ok.

Usually all the alien ships are lumped into one day.\n\nSaving money via CCU chain is leveraging on the difference between **value** (what the devs think the ship is worth) and **price** (what the ship is currently priced at). CCU is priced as the difference between value of the base ship and the price of the upgraded ship. For example:\n\n1. Suppose you have a ship A valued at 50, and want to upgrade to ship B valued at 200.\n2. Ship C originally **valued** at 90 goes on sale for a **price** of 70. A CCU from A to C costs 20 but bears a value of 40.\n3. Ship D originally **valued** at 150 goes on sale for a **price** of 120. A CCU from C to D costs 30 but bears a value of 60.\n4. Ship B originally **valued** at 200 goes on sale for a **price** of 175. A CCU from D to B costs 25 but bears a value of 50.\n5. Chaining these together, you will be paying a total of 50 (base ship) + 20 + 30 + 25 = 125, for a ship priced at 200 (ie 37.5% off).\n\nThe numbers in the above example are for only for illustration. Realistically by chaining between released/close-to-release ships, you'll probably see around 15-20% off if you gather CCU over a year, 20-30% off over several years, pushing for 30-40% if you are lucky, and only very rarely would you see discounts in the range of 40-50%.\n\nYou can potentially get more savings if you are very patient and bet on an in-concept ship. Ships always increase in price as they go from concept to in-progress to flight-ready to post-flight-ready; as such, if you pick up a ship in its early concept phase, then wait god knows how many years for it to release, it will have increased quite a bit in price. It is however a gamble, as no one knows exactly how long it would take for a ship to release, and no one knows how much it will increase in price (usually between 15-30%, but there have been outliers). I wouldn't recommend this method, unless you are aiming for very expensive ships in excess of 300 USD.",

If it was a CCU chain, the base of the chain would be placed into buyback (assuming that it is not from a referral bonus vehicle).

If you log back in after a crash, it will not let you pick a region or join on someone. This is actually bugged right now, the idea being you are locked to the shard you crashed on. But it doesn't work properly and often (almost always) will load you into a completely different shard.  The thing is, your ship full of cargo is still in the place you crashed on the original shard. With enough patience, you can get back to it (assuming you know where the ship was- if you were in QT or something, take the L and move on). I've recovered ships full of loot that I lost to a client crash by logging in and out of servers until I get back into the original shard that I crashed in and have been able to recover my ship and loot.\n\nI should also note- client crashes behave completely different from shard crashes. Shards now just display the Server Error dialog and do not disconnect you so if you chill until it spins up a new backend logic server, you won't lose anything. For client crashes there is no recovery or moving your ship to your home location or anywhere. The ship is right where you left it but only on the shard you left it on.",

            "The game costs 45$ which is the cost of a ship with a game package. It does not require you to pay any more than that. The game is crowdfunded essentially 100% and most of the sales are pledges people make for space ships that the devs either allow people to pledge as a concept for later development, or ships that are playable now. Pledging for a ship you like gets you access to it as soon as it comes out, but you can wait a few months and the ship will be available for in game purchase without spending any IRL money. Most ships in game you can get between days of playing for smaller ships and weeks to a month or two for the absolute largest ships. The game gets a reputation for whales because some people feel like pledging for ships either to get it ASAP, because they don\u2019t want to grind for it when it\u2019s available in game, or because the pledged ships will never be wiped. \n\nI can\u2019t stress enough, the game costs 45$ and that\u2019s all you ever have to pay. The people spending money do so because they choose to support the game funding in exchange for cool ships. \n\nThe game is not a scam. The people who say that usually got burnt out waiting for a ship they pledged for that had not been created yet, or they had buyers remorse after spending irresponsibly and waiting until after the 30 day no questions asked refund policy, or there was one game feature they really wanted that either is not 100% working or is not done yet. In fact, the company posts their annual financial reports filled to governments that shows that they are doing what they said: basically every dollar that comes in from funding goes immediately into development of the game, keeping their cash reserves low from year to year with payroll and the expense of the alpha game running on cloud servers for tens of thousands or more of concurrent players across many servers. If it were a scam, it would be the worst run scam in all history, being obscenely unprofitable with all the money going into tangible feature development and keeping it live just to maintain a ruse. \n\nSome people do take issue - a fair one - with how Star Citizen is the game in development that you can play now, but they are also using that money to make Squadron 42, an unreleased single player game. Although the two games trade features and development efforts back and forth, there are legitimate criticisms to make that players don\u2019t get to choose which game they are supporting. \n\nThe game is 10+ years in development at this point, which is not so much unheard of. It feels long because it\u2019s been open to players almost the entire time, games normally do not open for early access, beta, or honestly even alpha until usually very late in development when it\u2019s pretty much done. And games don\u2019t usually give people that long of a lead time to be aware of a game\u2019s development. Usually they wait until it\u2019s ready for players to test at the very end or for the marketing hype leading up to a release. It may be taking longer in the grand scheme of things than other games, but in the context of the norm, it\u2019s not late by much. \n\nAt the end of the day, don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the financial reports of you\u2019re concerned about legitimacy, check the pledge store to see how they make their money, and feel free to make an account to play for free during a free fly period (a week or two where anyone with an account can log in and play with a ship, full features, at no cost) and see whether it\u2019s your vibe. Maybe you like it but want to wait until it\u2019s finished. Maybe you like it and you jump in and join with the basic ship package. Maybe it\u2019s not for you at all and then you\u2019re in and out at no cost.",

II\n\n- Drake Cutlass Black\n\n- Drake Vulture\n\n- RSI Galaxy w/Cargo Module\n\n- RSI Zeus CL\n\n\nThis setup focuses on ships that can be easily soloed, or in the case of the Galaxy, a small crew that will have a lot of things to do on the ship since they will be the primary defense, engineering will still be required, and there will be cargo to attend to. The setup should cover fighter combat, be able to complete some higher tier flight combat, run cargo, salvage, and participate in some light dropship gameplay.",

Not an issue if you plan out a chain carefully from the start and commit to the plan. But if you have second thoughts and want to re-do the chain, melting CCUs would only refund in store credits, which cannot be used to buy warbond/discounted items.\n\nThe largest events are IAE in November (all ships are up for sale) and ILW in May (human-made combat ships are for sale). Alien Week in June has no in-game event, but complements ILW by putting alien-made ships up for sale. \n\nSome ships are available for sale and possibly as warbonds during minor events as well. For example, the Hercules series are usually available during Jump Town minor events. However, there is no fixed schedule for such events, and there is also no guarantee that any of the ship would be warbond.",

The layout of each station is different, so you'll have to look around a bit. It has a bright orange wall, and usually several terminals outside the door. Again, I am not sure if the security terminals are still there after 3.23.1, since a lot of new gear retrieval kiosks (currently non-functional) have been added and may have replaced the original terminal."

            "Over halfway there, the June r/starcitizen monthly events calendar is here!\n\nSame with last month things are a bit light as both us and our partners recover from both ILW and their events as well as prepare for some cool upcoming stuff.\n\nTo kick us off this month we have not one...but TWO death races taking place on Saturday, June 15th, first we have our Death Race taking place at 5pm UTC followed by ANZIA Racing's \"Mountains of Mayhem\" at 10pm UTC. Following that we have two more races from ANZIA, the \"Anti-Gravity Racing League\" and the \"Warpath Rally\". All of the above events are open for signups and have pledge prizes for the winners. We encourage you to check them out!\n\nTo participate in any of the above events join the Discord server\u00a0[here](https://discord.gg/starcitizen)\u00a0and check our #server-news channel\u00a0[here](https://discord.com/channels/82210263440306176/1113146864804573285).\n\nThanks\n\nIan/hencaric",
            "I joined the community Discord server and nobody there had any idea that 3 of the 4 of these events even existed.  No details at all for any of the ANZIA events and next to no information on the Death Race event.  There isn't even a channel or thread for discussing community events.\n\nTurns out where you actually need to go for information on these events is https://anziaracing.com/.",
            "Hey Kamakazie! \n\nYou need to check out our #server-news channel for information. The death race info is in there currently and the ANZIA events will be added today. Race events usually get added the same week for visibility but we are a bit behind this week on getting them up. \n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nEdit: regarding discussing them, you would just use our general channel.",

The Death Race event just says to respond with an emote in order for a chance to sign up, zero additional information about the structure of the race aside from the vehicle being used.\n\nI asked in the new player help and was told to ask in the general channel.  I asked in the general channel and got no response at all.  So then I asked in the Racing channel and got a response from a moderator who had no idea what I was talking about.",
            "Hi, you were responded to in the server with the link to the ANZIA race details. They are now in there.\n\nRegarding the death race, you aren't supposed to know things like the track layout, it is meant to be a surprise other than the vehicle used. It's a race in a Cyclone TR with a partner, the rest is obscured to prevent griefing issues. That being said, we could call that out better in the future and will do so.",

That's what server meshing is intended to do!\n\nThis is all about why server meshing is a major keystone for the entire project.",

I haven\u2019t seen a 30k this entire patch cycle, and haven\u2019t experienced a system reset while playing XT at all (in probably 20-25 hours of play).  I\u2019ve had a few instances of input lag, but nothing out of the ordinary.",
            "Seems funny they need to \"stress test\" all the time",
            "My guess is that XT and the gameplay it represents is going to be a major component of future gameplay. We'll do certain actions as an org, which will spawn this sort of gameplay. Sort like WoW Raids, \"We're going raid X tonight, we need y numbers of players\".\n\nA long time ago they talking about these gameplays wouldn't be timed, but rather dependent on players triggering them to start.",
            "I believe the point of it is to stress the servers, if it was on arena commander it wouldn't get the same data and wouldn't be an accurate test for the PU.\n\nEnd of the day they want to stress the PU now with these events so at release these events can start and finish without any problems. Arena commander would be good to find bugs with event itself but often times it's about how it affects the game while other people are doing other things in the verse as its happening.\n\nI get the frustration though, a lot of people just want to play the game as a game and have fun, and these events are awful for stability even after they finish.",
            "The goal is to get it working. This isn't a finished game by any stretch.",
            "Definitely not.  Servers not handling it is not really a reason, and moving it away deprives devs the opportunity to capture the data they need.\n\nServers were not the issue when I played it.  Framerate was.  We had the UI saying we were getting 4 FPS in the Idris, combat becomes challenging at that rate.  The framerate definitely did not feel as high as 4 though.",
            "Please please please CIG! If it were more performant, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the best example of what SC can do right now. Lots of ships, some fighting, others loading cargo, disembarking to EVA and board the wrecks for FPS\u2026 great showcase of just how seamless everything is. I just wish I could play it with fewer issues.",
            "Its a stress test technically. Luckily it doesn't last that long. 25th is the end of XT for now. If you really cant stand it, I do not think its so horrible to just not play star citizen for like a week and a half (I'm taking this approach after I managed to do XT twice early on)",

Servers are pretty much garbage now but for a while it was playable which is more than I have experienced before. \n\nIt\u2019s a stress test. Don\u2019t get stressed.",
            "I tried XT 6 times. 6 Times the server died and weird things happened afterwards so I could not finish the mission. I'm now stuck because the game set my status to stations to hostile and I have to pay 110k to repair my ship but I'm down to 45k because I set up my ship to use it properly in XT. I will wait till the next patch, maybe even one more until I will play SC again.

I know it's still early alpha, but it still sucks when you do nothing wrong but get punished and lose everything all because the server craps itself.",

Some random in chat gave me the aUEC worth of the load. I didn't even ask. I just laughed about being broke, because I had spent all my space cheddar previously.",

When there's rain and sandstorms, nothing else is even going to touch this game. People aren't going to compare it to other games, they're going to compare it to movies.",

I had just logged in for the day and that was my first run of the day. \n\nI didn't even sleep with the station QM's wife. I swear...",

            "I feel for you and it's definitely a reason I'm avoiding playing right now. My sincerest hope us that 90% of these cases are caused by desynced collisions and will be rectified as server meshing becomes final and the backend more stable.",
            "Had this happen/heard about it in chat a fair amount this patch. At this point I'm pretty sure it's a feature.",
            "Happened in my vulture. Well I maxed it out, 2 loads in the cargo bay and one unboxed. I turned away from the scrap to make my way to \u00c018 and it just exploded, showing all those boxes fly apart and spread out. 400k and a couple of hours of my life just undone. I wasted time fitting some trawlers and a decent QT drive too. 10 years of routinely returning to check up on it's progress and something like this happens. I used to rage in my younger years. Now I just turn it off and wait for the next big thing.",

            "This literally happend to me also, after finally figuring out how to put things into scu boxes. I dont regret pledging at all, however I will be returning at a later date when things are somewhat consistent. For now I got a $1 xbox pass to play Starfield to scratch my space trucker itch.",

            "I said the exact same thing today after finally finding the courage to do an RMC cargo run. 10 FPS server, seemed stable. Did a few missions. Everything was running great. Got out my C2. Flew to Pickers. Empty. Buy RMC. Take off. Server 30k's and the login server dies. I'm unable to log back in for 30 minutes. \n\nHad a bunch of bugs and shitty days leading up to this like getting pirated and killed for the 33 SCU of RMC in my Vulture. The dude literally backed up their ship to mine and we had a firefight with handguns after the ship combat was over. It wasn't too crazy and for a moment I thought I might be having fun but like I saw something earlier said, you put a lot more effort into getting cargo to sell than effort into pirating. It just felt shitty that 3 hours was just gone. Today was just the last straw. I'm done till 3.24. See y'all in a bit guys.",

            "The desync right now is horrific. Doing ERT's tonight, ships were just teleporting around. A few of us rammed enemy ships when they just appeared in front of us.

It could count your approach from 3km out as you being right next to the planet, so obviously you're still going really fast when you're 3km out. And it won't report your death until you're close.\n\nThose numbers are completely pulled out of my ass and I don't reccomend you take me completely seriously. Def a grain of salt here. It depends heavily on your server fps. If you gotta sustained super low sever fps and you're approaching a planet, it's best to play it safe and just take 15 minutes to land going slow from wayyyyy before you reach the cloud layer.\n\nAt that point tho... I'd rather just risk the bullshit. If I'm gonna explode from some shit like that, it was fated to happen from birth. Anyway, I forgot what I was trying to say when I made this comment.

Second, thanks to MM, they shift to NAV mode and accelerate+boost to intercept you. Lastly, the PU servers are hovering around 4-5fps which causes NPCs to become somewhat unresponsive aka \u201cbrain dead.\u201d All of those factors combine to make our little friend, the kamikaze NPC.",

            "What?! That's not how it works at all, I come out of max speed cruise in a Hornet at 3km and hit gear in the last 50m or so.\n\nBUT It does run the risk of the server desync murdering you currently.\nComing in at a shallow angle and flaring can help and still be fast",

The detection range for the commodity terminals seems to be based on something related to the range you can access the local inventory from (which is usually pretty far out). This means you can do cargo selling or trading without even landing. In the case of something like a caterpillar (a c2 would probably also work) you can have one compartment loaded with a fury and the rest loaded with RMC, launch the fury down to sell without risking the full load of RMC alongside it.",
