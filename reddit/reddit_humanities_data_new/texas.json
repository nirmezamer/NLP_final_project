            "i recently lived in Fort Worth and it's decently walkable. at least in comparison to Dallas. plus there's a smaller city feel while still having a lot of cool stuff. slightly cheaper than the Dallas area, but idk how long that'll last. i'm planning on moving back there at the first of the year. have friends there and it has all i needed. minus the heat, but that's Texas.",
            "My post was removed and told to post here. My questions isn't about moving in Texas, it is about leaving the State for better parts of the country. \n\nSome background info before I get into it. I\u2019m 29 moved to the US when I turned 18 after living abroad for my entire life prior.\n\nMoved to Amherst MA in 2014 then Central Texas in 2015 and I\u2019ve been here ever since. I own a small 1 bedroom condo in south Austin which I can afford. Have a decent amount of savings.\n\nHowever, the state is becoming increasingly unpleasant to live in and this problem will be compounded going forward as the state has no climate resilience plan. I googled for different water plans and regional resiliency plans and the one for the coastal management doesn\u2019t mention climate change at all.\n\nWe have to worry about our power going out when it gets too hot or too cold.\n\nMy taxes are going to highway expansions and police who don\u2019t do their jobs. Not public transport or infrastructure upgrades to benefit anyone. I also really hate the primary mode of development here which is suburban sprawl.\n\nOur state government is wholly owned by large corporations and rich evangelicals.\n\nWhere do I go?\n\nI\u2019m looking at Minnesota Minneapolis Saint Paul metro - most of the global fresh water is on the Great Lakes, Minnesota has a government that doesn\u2019t actively hate the people who live there. More dense than Austin and much cheaper to live/own a home there.\n\nHas anyone else been thinking about leaving? Where are you looking? Have you been/lived in other states?\n\nOpen to critique or other things to consider and just want some opinions on places in the US to move to. I\u2019ve considered moving back to Europe but the whole visa process bit daunting.",
