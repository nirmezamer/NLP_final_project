            "Classical economics dictates that as the cost of money (ie: interest rates) increases, the price of goods should be under pressure, but this is not what we have seen in the housing markets. In the 4 years from 2Q 2016 to 2Q 2020, 30 year fixed rates went from 3.54% down to 2.98%. At the same time, median US home prices went from $306,000 to $317,100, a CAGR of about  +0.9%.(Using FRED data).Pretty much in line with classical economic expectations.\n\nHowever, from 2Q 2020 to 2Q 2024, 30 yr fixed rates went from 2.98% to now around 7.60%. In this same time, median US home prices have risen from $317,100 to $420,800, a CAGR of over 9%. \n\nI understand the covid effect for some of this, but the rate of price appreciation has continued on past the end of lockdowns. Additionally, if this was due to a demographic shift out of cities to suburbs, why are median rent prices in cities continuing to increase at strong rates, with NYC median rents +4.3% in 2023, and rising a further +5.4% in 2024.\n\nDo interest rates even matter right now? Have demographics broken the interest rate mechanism? At what point does affordability, taking into account the impact of higher rates, start to weigh on prices?",

So, that's (.227*112,045) = 25,434 households. \n\nSubtract them off the grand total for the state, you get (128,918-25,034) = 103,884 households in AR that make more than $150k.\n\nBreak that into a percentage (103,884/1,216,918), 8.54% of the state is still above that $150k per year mark.",
