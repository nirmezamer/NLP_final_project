        "content": "Hi all\n\nSo, I graduated back in May 2022. 3.5 GPA. BBA in Finance. I am 27 years old. \u00a0No internships. No relevant work experience. No clubs, or anything of that nature (during college.). I would like to work in finance and use my degree, but I just feel stuck now. During college I worked a retail job while in school ($10/hr.). Currently I work as a landscaper ($16/hr.). The job is straightforward but at times it can be hard on the body especially during the summertime (I am in Texas.). My coworkers are all great and all, most of them don\u2019t speak a lick of English (some just recently arrived to the U.S.). but I am bilingual and have no issue communicating. Usually, I am the one that is in charge since I speak English.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling down on myself. The fact that I graduated 2 years ago and still can\u2019t find a job in finance makes me feel bad about myself. I just feel like I should be making more money at this age. Been with the landscaping company for about 2 years now (started in June 2022). I did apply to jobs when I graduated and even before, but I would get no interviews for the most part. The ones I did I would just be ghosted or flat out told I would not be getting the job. Given the current job market it feels impossible to even get a job nowadays. Truth be told I stopped applying back in the spring of 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are nights where I can\u2019t sleep, nights where I feel like ending it all. You see people graduating and getting nice paying jobs and then there is me. \u00a0I just want to ask for some advice on here. What are my options? Should I just pursue a trade job instead? I keep up with the financial markets, keep up with what the Fed is doing, how the economy is doing, etc. I do have a passion for it but I just don't know what to do at the moment.\n\nThank you",

This is a pretty small nonprofit, so not a lot of funds were coming in. After a year, I worked my way up to Finance Director (looks great on a resume). While volunteering I was able to customize my skill set, for example I had to read about the tax laws regrading non profits, I had to learn what it took to be able to solicit funds in other states. All this learned knowledge puffed up my resume, and I was able to land a job (after about a year and a half of searching) as a financial analyst at a nonprofit.\n   Check out the nonprofit industry; most pay.

        "content": "I see a lot of terrible information especially on the subreddit compared to other sites like Wall Street Oasis and I honestly believe people have been following them and derailing their lives so I wanted to make a list that would undoubtedly get me downvotes. \n\nI went to a semi target in England but now work in NYC and I remember at least 3 guys who would talk down on every one at my college who got internships at Nomura IBD and a friend of mine who went to Notre Dame said there were people at his college who did the same thing (if you don't know Nomura was the subject of many finance memes in the mid 2010s, people would say you failed in life if you worked there etc).\n\nOne of the guys i knew said he was going **ONLY** for GS SSG and the other guy was Investment Management at MS, they ignored all the big 4 recruiters that came to our school too. They were heavy into finance memes and would give the sort of advice i see on here. \n\nFast forward now and both of those guys are now working as \\*drumroll\\* tax preparers in those weird corner store tax stores surrounded by food markets and share an apartment with loads of other people. \n\nThey have both turned to bitter black pill people especially because the people in our year are now making VP or made the jump to the buyside and living well. \n\nNot saying being a tax preparer is bad but compared to what our coursemates went on to achieve its pretty bleak. \n\nHere is a list of things you should pay attention to:\n\n**1. If you didn't go to a good school AND have incredible grades AND great internships you are 100% wasting your time trying for IBD/HF/PE unless your family is incredibly connected:** Coming here to ask what your odds are is ridiculous imo because you will get people that will encourage you to keep trying when your energy should be spent trying to get employed. I have seen people here saying they regret not accepting the corp fin or some other job they got and now they are X years unemployed because they were waiting for IB/PE/HF.\n\n**2. Don't believe people that say Big 4 anything is a terrible look on your resume, I can bet you $1000 they are not in the industry and the only thing they know about finance is from The Wolf of Wall Street:** I have seen posts worried about accepting Big 4 offers and comments saying not to accept them because it will close doors. This one annoys me the most because I actually went from Big 4 to IBD and know many many people that did. You would be surprised the dregs of society that are on this sub giving this sort of advice. \n\n**3. The CFA is not useless:** This is another one I keep seeing, once again at my bank I have seen people make the move from commercial banking to IBD after taking the CFA and I work for a BB. I made the opposite jump from IBD to CB because someone left a seat open after moving to Lev Fin at my bank after passing the CFA. \n\n**4. Turning down any offer to try and hold on for an IB/PE/HF role makes you deserve career failure like those people from my college.** This is just reckless and stupid because even target students take less than desirable jobs for the stability. In this day and age turning down any full time employment is incredibly ridiculous and quite honestly i feel like you deserve whatever comes your way if you do this.\n\n**5. I don't care how toxic your work is don't quit without another one.** Enough said.\n\n**6. You SHOULD feel a sense of urgency to get your life together.** This is another really annoying one, i don't care how young you are, you do not have all the time in the world to find yourself, this isn't the 90s anymore. I have seen people post here saying they are panicking because they are about to graduate with no internship and no job and the comments would be filled with millennials saying they have all the time in the world to worry about that later. DO NOT LISTEN TO TO THESE PEOPLE. \n\n",

            "Appreciate that different people have different experiences but I would disagree with some of what you've posted.\n\n1. You don't need all 3 to get into IB, 2/3 works, 1/3 works if you're willing to suffer through a longer path to IB, ex: Corp banking first. \n\n2. Big 4 is not terrible for your resume, but it is a different skill set than one in IB. IMO most Big 4 bound candidates would be great fits for Commercial and Corp banking roles (in terms of college recruiting) and both of those offer a better path to IB than Big 4. It doesn't sound sexy to be a credit analyst at Union Bank vs consultant at Deloitte but the credit analyst has a better shot for an IB role. \n\n3. CFA is not useless but it is a huge waste of time for something that is only tangentially useful for IB UNLESS your end goal is HF. The amount of time spent on the CFA would be better spent on recruiting and networking than studying. At least, thats the advice my corp banking MD gave me which I followed. \n\n4. I disagree, you shouldn't just accept any role out there. I agree that those ONLY targetting GS or other super specific banks shouldnt limit themselves. The reality is, unless youre at one of the top BB's, most of the banks are interchangeable. \n\n5. Agreed UNLESS your current job is so time heavy you cant recruit for others, and you have a nest egg to last a few months of searching. \n\n6. 100% agree on this. Your career is what you make of it, you have to be your own advocate and you have to hunt for the roles that you want. \n\n\u201cNothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.

Especially if you include lower middle market, specialized boutiques, and independent sponsors. These also have a faster path to getting your own name on the door.\n\nThere's also more to Finance than equity investing & acquisitions...  at a minimum, go after debt sponsors (banking, structured finance, mezz / distressed players, even ABL/ senior debt) but there's an even broader set of opportunities within insurance, risk management, hedging. The same skills can also be used to manage portfolios of B2B contracts.\n\n> **Don't believe people that say Big 4 anything is a terrible look on your resume**\n\nEh, but remember your limitations. It's solidly in the lower middle of the prestige hierarchy. Fortune 500 (lower in the scale) will accept you with open arms, PE will happily bring you into portco Finance & Transformation roles, you've got to roll a hard six to parlay that into an investment track role at a top shop.  Credentials wise, you're outgunned....\n\n> **The CFA is not useless:**\n\nPerhaps, but most of the time it feels like a \"Hail Mary\" pass by people who are already on the struggle bus...\n\nIn retrospect, I should have probably gotten one... but I was already in the role they were supposed to help me get...\n\n> **Turning down any offer to try and hold on for an IB/PE/HF role makes you deserve career failure like those people from my college.**\n\nDepends on the offer. Believe me, there are \"tracks\" career wise that you're exiting into out of college. And changing tracks gets progressively harder the further you move away from on campus recruiting....\n\nIf you want to ultimately be buyside before 30, you need to get on the right bus. That's worth holding out for...\n\n> **5. I don't care how toxic your work is don't quit without another one.**\n\nThe one part I agree with.

You generally need to be preparing for it when picking schools\n\nSo yeah I imagine it\u2019s more privileged to a degree but not surprisingly so",
            "From a UK perspective; yes. It has improved but it\u2019s systemically structured to favour those from privileged backgrounds.\n\nI realised this when I worked in a recruitment firm hiring for senior IB / PE roles. It\u2019s a strange situation where you get to see the thousands of flowing CVs, each containing candidates\u2019 educational backgrounds. people who ended up in these front-office finance roles were, disproportionately, in superior pre-university schooling (private, grammar, comprehensive schools in affluent areas). We were often paid for anonymised insights on this by large firms who were actively trying to improve their perceived \u2018diversity\u2019 and compare against the market.\n\nI remember having an assignment once from a well-known growth equity firm who wanted an Investment Associate, caveated with being state-educated. One of the hardest assignments I\u2019ve ever worked on, there were so few.\n\nSomeone has reasonably stated reasons as to why this is the case and I completely agree. To land a successful, high-paying finance role you not only have to have the intellect and drive (lots of people have this), you need to be aware of the narrow pathway that will lead you there [Target school, competitive course, spring week, internship, full-time role]. Coming from a privileged environment would make you more likely to be aware of this pathway at the right time.\n\nOther forms of finance like quant finance/ HFT place more emphasis on pure brainpower and you can often forego internships etc. by being exceptionally clever, and exceptionally clever on paper.",

Because, they got connections, money and opportunities to enter the field..which the middle class can't afford.\n\nIt's sad.. but that's how it is.\n\nEdit: I will not be able to attend the school because i simply cannot afford it.

Then you have to actually know what that career path is what it entails and you need to know at a young age. Most college kids don't know what an investment bank,  hedge fund or private equity firm does at the age of 18, its only a select few people that largely go to elite schools. I'd know. I am a quant and I taught finance in the average state school during my Ph.D.\n\n\n\nDoes that mean that if your not privileged you have zero shot? Of course not.  A few first generations college students do end up at top universities, a few people from relatively  network their way in.  However, the cards have always been stacked in the favor of people who have better opportunities. Its point less to think about this. Life is not fair. You do the best you can with the cards your dealt.  Your born in the United States, you have better opportunities than 99.99 percent born in Bangladesh or Algeria or Cambodia or Mongolia.  \n  \nAs far as high finance and privilege go, people don't get rejected because their families were working class. They are rejected because they don't have the right credentials and don't know the path to getting into these jobs.  Reality is that people who are going to have those credentials and know the path are usually people that grew up in well off families. \n\nIts not simply being well off. Generally, its people who went to schools that create a lot of investment bankers or are associated with  of those people.
