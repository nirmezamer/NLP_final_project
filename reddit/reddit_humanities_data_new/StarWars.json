            "Scouted out a Jedi undetected on a planet bounty hunters dare not go. Good old hiding in plain sight Qimir.",
            "According to the credits, that Cerean Jedi is in fact Ki-Adi-Mundi himself. How the fuck old is he?",
            "\"I promise\"\n\nWelp there's a death flag.",
            "I'll just say... we didn't see Bazil and the Sith at the same time",
            "What about the Sith attack on the Wookie?",
            "Dammit we finally get a Wookiee Jedi and he\u2019s already killed likely by the Sith",
            "How do you kill a Jedi without a weapon? \n\nBy turning them to the dark side.",
            "Osha is the real \"Acolyte\" of this series, I'm calling it now.\n\nMae has turned her back on the dark side and burned her bridges with her master. \n\nOsha seems very aware that she holds traits that make her vulnerable to the dark side, and keeps trying to remove herself from the Jedi as a result. But Sol keeps dragging her back in.\n\nAnd he has just confirmed he has a secret that Osha is unaware of. One that might shatter her worldview towards the dark in the same way that Osha being alive began to turn Mae back to the light.",
            "That was a short episode and ended in the middle of a scene, felt very abrupt",
            "And there\u2019s the cover up. They never told the council",
            "Damn you Sol, don\u2019t make me love you! I know it will only hurt in the end",
            "Darth Bortles theory remains strong!",
            "I find it interesting that the Master simply flung Osha to the side. He's not going for her, he went straight for the Jedi. He could have simply killed her and then attacked them, Force knows he had the time and opportunity. But he just used the Force and took her out of the fight. He might be trying to preserve her to become his new acolyte. She's probably stronger than Mae, having received more training, both in the Force and in other matters a Sith hiding across the galaxy may need. Or maybe he just needs her because of some Force power between the twins.",
            "Little tracker lad is pure star wars nonsense.  More of that please",
            "Wait...the person who is helping Mae...he's totally the sith master right?",
            "Frustrating cliffhanger aside, the Sith floating down in the background was fucking rad.",
            "Looks like Ki-Adi-Mundi",
            "If Kelnacca doesn\u2019t rip off even a single arm, I will be very sad",
            "Looking forward to finding out what Qimir's Sith title is. Been a while since we've seen a new Darth in live action.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The master already being there was pretty terrifying, and the way they descended was creepy as hell",
            "Theory: I\u2019m at the point where Mae is asking Qimir about their master, Qimir is definitely the master right? With him exploring a place he says bounty hunters wouldn\u2019t go and telling Mae about how she needs to do things, I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s secretly her master.\n\nEdit: Also seeming to get kinda upset when she says the task is impossible, and holding himself back at first from saying that it\u2019s not impossible, to me suggests he\u2019s the one who made the task and is frustrated at her suggesting that he gave her an impossible test.\n\nEdit 3: The whole ending, with the wookie being found killed by a lightsaber slash and the sudden appearance of the master, also makes me thinks it\u2019s Qimir.",
            "Well, that was a terrifying giant bug.",
            "Oh damn this is going to be good!\n\nEnd Credits\n\nOh come on!!",
            "The best part of the episode was the last 3 minutes",
            "Anyone else feel like the episode ended super abruptly? Irritatingly so?",
            "I think the master wants Osha as an apprentice and is using Mae to get to her.\n\nI have zero proof of anything. Just a feeling.",
            "Vernestrra making sure the High Council is not informed of what is going on because of the political damage that would fall upon the Jedi having to tell the Senate, both shows how the Jedi as an order are beginning to fall, but also keeps the Council away from knowing about the Sith and thus keeping canon unified so far. And even if Mundi was in the room, the conversations in the room were about Mae's master being a splintered Jedi, so that doesn't mean he would have known it was Sith.",
            "So Qimir has to be the sith right? It\u2019s obvious but that doesn\u2019t make it a bad choice",
            "Congratulations Bazil you are officially my favorite character on this show",
            "that felt so short. i 100% believe the tracker guy who\u2019s been assisting mae is the sith leader. he\u2019s been pushing her to finish her lesson, and making sure he is nearby to observe her. plus after she tied him up, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that since he\u2019s a better tracker and knows this forest better than mae, he likely cut himself down and reached the wookiee\u2019s hut before she got there, killed him himself, and now sees an opportunity to kill a shit ton of jedi himself. calling it now",
            "I liked this episode way more than episode 3 but for how long the run time is it feels like the story barely progressed.",
            "I personally think the Sith master is Vernestra based mostly on the fact that I don\u2019t like her",
            "The atmosphere starting from the point where Mae enters Kelnacca's home was so tense for me.  I'm surprised the master didn't kill Osha on the spot",
            "I think the master is someone Sol knows deeply from the past because he sensed them and acted like Ahsoka feeling Darth Vader\u2026 as if it were some ghost haunting him and he too brushed it away because it seemed he thought there was no way it could be who he thought.",
            "Man as soon as I saw that landing party I knew it was full of redshirts",
            "That sith is actually terrifying. The helmet* is really unsettling.",
            "I get triggered by the word \"civilian\" in SW now ever since Mace called Ahsoka that\n\nEdit: Forgot Mace called her \"citizen\"",
            "Disney needs to take notes from literally every other streaming service when comes to episode length \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Master Tormund\u00a0",
            "Man, that war with the Nihil must have totally drained the Jedi order of its talent; these Jedi feel like the \"C-Team\".",
            "Disrespectful cliffhanger.",
            "Well the Masters introduction was pretty terrifying. Did he silently glide down from above?\n\nReminded me a little of that scene in Aliens when they're in their hive",
            "A ginger Jedi master? Star Wars is ruined!",
            "I'd watch a full episode of a Wookie Jedi living in the wilderness.\n\nJedi practicing with Boken's!\n\nI can't even recall Osha and Jekki having 3 conversations together, but it was a nice sendoff. I also respect Osha trying to extricate herself from this plot for her mental health...to less than stellar success.\n\nIt's kind of funny how they write off Mae's master as a Rogue Jedi because they can't fathom or refuse to even admit to the possibility that they're dealing with a Sith...though it feels like an unspoken possibly that Vernestra wants to make sure ISN'T the case.\n\nVernestra really feels like female Mace now down to the baldness and trying to keep control over the Jedi Order and maintain their image within the Republic.\n\nQimir starting to lay it on thick that he might be the Master. Oh, let me just go out of my way to help you on your mission while dispensing words of wisdom and making your true path more clear while gauging your emotional health and feelings. He seems to drop the act every time he brings up Osha.\n\nI wonder if the big turning point is Mae trying to re-frame all of Sol's concern and trying to save her and Osha as him just trying to continue to cover up or make up for the guilt over what happened to the Coven.\n\n\"You want me to rejoin the Jedi Order!?\" - By Osha's tone, it sounds like she would've said yes had that been the case.\n\nLook at all these nameless Jedi! Be a shame if they ran into a Sith.\n\nNot many speciies can pull off Jedi Civilian Robes.\n\nI almost feel bad for Mae that Osha was straight up trying to talk Yord into killing her. Also rare Yord wisdom moment.",
            "Uh oh, Mae has altered the deal!",
            "I get that Jedi have to maintain a Force-themed view of death, but Jecki saying 'it's a honor to witness a creature return to the Force' about the gigantic demon-beetle her Master just beheaded is actually hilarious.",
            "The moment I saw the runtime for the episode, I knew I wasn't going to be happy. And sure enough...\n\nThis isn't really something exclusive to the Acolyte, but I really hate weekly episode releases that have variable episode length and the like. It just makes the pacing and wait between episodes really annoying.\n\nWas interested this entire past week to see where things go and now it's another week before I hopefully see how it all shakes out.",
            " Ki-Adi Mundi is in the credits, also way better episode but MAN THE ENDING. They really should let us binge the whole thing, it would fix so many issues , the abrupt endings wouldnt feel so bad",
            "Qimir: \u201che\u2019ll kill you.\u201d  Yep that\u2019s the master.",
            "This has the Sith\u2019s blood all over it",
            "There it goes Ladies & Gents. As to why modern Jedi don't know about any Sith presence for a thousand yrs. It was hidden as theorized and makes sense with the galactic politics",
            "They mentioned shift, which of course was a large theme in the Plagueis Novel. Would love this to somehow get to him or tenebrous as the Master\u2019s master",
            "The otter looking tracker Bazil is already a new favourite.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "This show is frustrating... because I think the concept behind it is interesting, but the pacing, editing and dialogue is hurting the execution.\n\nIn episode 4 it feels like very little happens.... until it gets interesting in the last few minutes and then the episode abruptly ends.\n\nI feel like the first 4 episodes could be re-edited into something quite a bit more compelling (interweave the flashback, etc).\n\nThe dialogue is whatever... almost every non-Andor show has terrible dialogue (I don't get it - are they trying to make it bad?  The ST and Rogue One were fine dialogue wise and Andor was excellent).  I could more easily overlook it if the pacing/editing was better I think.\n\n  \nI think this should would be better if they released all the episodes at once.",
            "Kill a wookie Jedi without a weapon?\u00a0 Yeah, now that is a test.",
            "I did not expect Mae to turn herself over. Well. Let's see how this goes for her.",
            "Love that Wookiee Jedi",
            "I loved the way the Sith floated down. I have a great feeling about the next episode.",
            "Was that a lightsaber Qimir put in his back pack?",
            "Yeah, Sol ain't getting a chance to explain shit.",
            "WOOKIEE JEDI, LFG.",
            "Ahh, the cliff hanger ending felt more frustrating than exciting. I wish they\u2019d given us a taste of the action before leaving us high and dry.",
            "I\u2019ll be honest the massive cliff hangers piss me off",
            "Without recaps and credits, that episode was 27 minutes long.  This is my biggest gripe with these Disney+ series.  Give me at least 45 minutes.  Make it worth my while.  This is the runtime of a network sitcom.",
            "Holy blue balls",
            "What is everyone eating right now?",
            "The freaking Sith killed him",
            "That force push has some unlimited power to it",
            "Can someone explain why Mai went so 180\u00b0 just like that? From let me kill Jedi to imma surrender? Maybe I\u2019m lost but it didn\u2019t make sense to me",
            "It's been said before, but this series should have been released all at once. It's not an episodic series. It's a long movie broken into parts.\n\nI'm still open to the potential this series has, but episode 4 wasn't much of an episode at all. Nothing happened. It just set up next week's episode. \n\nIt was a tease. 30 minutes of nothing happening, and it ended when something was about to happen.",
            "So I checked the heights between Qimir and Mae then Darth Grin and Osha, they look just about the same. It could be a fakeout I guess but more likely the \"Master's\" identity isn't the big reveal in the series.",
            "Khofar looks lovely, rather mountainous.\u00a0 Perhaps it reminded him of a long lost memory of home.",
            "He\u2019s so creepy, I love him",
            "My theory and hope of Mae losing faith in her master after discovering Osha was alive turned out to be true. Only reasonable thing for Mae to do because trying to get an explanation from her master would just be more manipulation however Sol clearly has felt the masters presence before and that\u2019s very intriguing moving into the next half of the series.",
            "I feel like Sol keeps having the same conversation over and over. The ending kicked ass and saved the episode.",
            "Qimir being super squirrely makes me sus, but then it's too obvious that he'd be the big bad\n\nVernestra is acting super sus too\n\nI'm guessing next episode is called \"Night\"",
            "Think about it. Regardless of who Qimir is (probably the Apprentice) he knew where the wookie was. This was leaked to him. The Sith Master is a Jedi. I would also note that Qimir said he cared about Mae and the masked fellow did not attack Osha. Love maybe????\n\nAlso, the locations in Wales and Madeira\nwere breathtaking in this episode! Def made me want to go back to both places.",
            "Oh god, question pronouns (even though it would be a legit question with aliens if you really think about it). I can hear the rage videos already happening.",
            "IIRC, sith acolytes (legends) or sith assassins, were prospective sith that were not trained by a sith lord. They were below sith apprentices (true sith) and a sith apprentice may have even had several acolytes. It would make sense that qimir is the apprentice, who has a master, and is training Mae to overthrow his master, thus making Mae his \u201cacolyte\u201d. \n\nWho the master is, is interesting. It could either be disneys version of Darth Tenebrous, or Darth Plaugeis himself. Idk what muun lifespan is, but i don\u2019t think its that far off from human lifespan so maybe not. Then again, ki adi mundi\u2019s people were supposed to have short lifespans as well, but- evidently, they do not. \n\nThis really may be disneys way of cannonizing Darth Plagueis. Im 90% sure the master is either plaugeis, or Tenebrous. Maybe Qimir was a failed apprentice, who was replaced by Plaugeis. We have to wait and see but honestly, this shit is getting good.",
            "Gotta love a SW show filmed in real world locations. Good stuff this episode, kinda short, and I have many questions!",
            "Darth Batman Who Laughs",
            "These episodes feel so\u2026.unfulfilling? The way they end mid action sequence is just weird to me. I want to love this show but man this is rough",
            "How did Wookiee celebrate Life Day back then?",
            "Loved the horror-esque ending to this episode. It\u2019s so exciting to see Sith badassery!",
            "Alright so I'm liking this series so far, with a handful of relatively minor complaints. Sith dude is cool, but yeah. \n\nPlease Disney, for hell's sake, just drop entire shows. Seriously, this is getting annoying. It's so difficult to stay immersed in something, and it's hard to maintain interest, when I am only watching for 20 minutes a week. And it is so difficult to wait until the end because I'll inevitably get spoiled. \n\nIt's literally not even enough to fully capture my attention, because I have so much going on in my life that stresses me out, so I log in to watch Star Wars and as soon as I just barely kind of start to forget my troubles, it's over and I'm back into the real shitty world. Thanks. Really appreciate it.\n\nI love Star Wars, but I really hate weekly release schedules. Just drop it all at once. This isn't television where you're trying to fit into a tight schedule. It's a streaming service, and I pay for a streaming service so I \\*don't\\* have to spend 3 months to watch 8 episodes of a show. Just fucking give us the whole show. It really is feeling like a waste of my time, interest, and money to stay subscribed. It's not even just minorly annoying, it is genuinely fucking irritating that I am spending a $20 bucks a month for 20 minutes per week. \n\nI may just bite the fucking bullet and just come back once a year at this point. It sucks that I'll get spoiled, but it's not worth paying you greedy bastards $240 a year only to barely even get immersed in things. Which I know is EXACTLY what you're trying to do. Stretch the watch time out as far as you possibly can, because you want me to stay subscribed. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Fuck that. I'm done. I'll catch up later on \\*specifically\\* just to spite the blatant greed.\n\nSo fucking disappointing. Show's fine, but fuck Disney regardless until they stop playing stupid games.",
            "I look forward to the very reasonable, not at all unhinged, discourse about this episode.",
            "After seeing Darth Smiley up close now I think they're a woman, not a man. Could be wrong though. Can't wait for the reveal, maybe next week?",
            "I really like what this show is doing. But that was a bullshit way to end an episode that was essentially just conversations. I need it to land the plane in the last four episodes; I think it will, but that ending really irritated me.",
            "That little *\u2019flick\u2019* was so great",
            "East coast leader standing by...",
            "Totally on board with Mae\u2019s 180. With the sole idea that her whole family is dead is not true and finding out your twin is alive, realizing how much effort you\u2019re doing for something that is now based around a lie, feeling far away enough/safe from the masters reach and can think how she wants without influence.",
            "Prediction: Yord isn't going to fair well in the fight, since he's shown himself to be a very 'by-the-books' thinking kind of guy, and the Sith has already shown himself to be an unorthodox thinker.",
            "\"Yo this guy pulled out the red lightsaber jump his ass because we all know what this type of force users are capable of\"\n\nProceed to get ass whooped",
            "This green lady takes me out every time",
            "Wow can\u2019t wait to see more Smilo Ren!",
            "May not have been her that killed her family",
            "I want to know what it\u2019s like cuddling a wookie",
            "Man this show loves cliffhangers",
            "God they really do make some strange choices with this show. \n\nThat villain entrance was creepy as fuck. Genuinely well done. \n\nI liked Osha\u2019s awareness with the bug and her conflict about how her powers led to its death. More self-awareness than the jedi in the film era for sure. \n\nPlus that tracker was a funny addition and I did get a laugh out of the civilian robes bit.\n\nBut that green woman in the temple feels so strange every time shes on screen. Shes got an odd look that isnt helping some wooden acting. \n\nAnd why in the world would you end it there. Cliffhangers dont work when the episode is only 28 minutes and that was barely even a cliffhanger. You already revealed the master was there, you just cut off the fight which had been teased in all the promo images. \n\nLast episode was quite poor and this was better, but the show still feels like a teen drama, when they teased it as this darker, more mature story about the dark side. Im sticking around because I like the premise and Sol is endearing as fuck. Dafne Keen is a promising character as well.",
            "Well that was\u2026 short",
            "What if the Sith Master is actually the Zabrak Witch Mother lady? The build looked a little too small for me to keep thinking its Qymir.",
            "I'm just watching this, but I am so tired of these shows having 45-50 minute openers and then giving me a half hour of show.  34 minutes is the run-time today.",
            "Something interesting finally happens and it ends so abruptly...\n\nThere's some cool ideas in this series, but the execution is all over the place. Especially in terms of editing and pacing.",
            "the whole episode felt like the first 10 minutes of an episode \n\nfr a whole lot of nothing happens then as soon as what I felt like was going to be the actual content of the episode starts to kicks off it just...ends? Like 15 minutes earlier than usual? \n\nI don't even have anything really to say about what actually happened in the episode, because it really was just...nothing? Apart from walking through a forest and slicing a bug? Am I going crazy here?",
            "Mae all of sudden being like 'yo i'm done imma turn myself in' is baaaaaaad storytelling.",
            "This is so fuckin obvious, that it cannot be the reveal. It actually would surprise me more if he ISN'T a red hering.",
            "Why don't the bounty hunters go there? It feels like we've seen a dozen far more dangerous planets",
            "Yea but who was the random Kel Dor with the dispatched team?",
            "Don't tell Garfield. He hates Mundi.",
            "Isn't the thing with Cereans that they can live a really long time but also don't have many male children, which is why Ki-Adi-Mundi is canonically one of the only Jedi allowed to fuck (because they need as many breeding males as possible)? Or was that just Legends?\n\n\nEDIT: So apparently that was just legends and I misremembered it (apparently they didn't have that long of lifespans).",
            "Probably close to 130 around the time of episode 3 if not older than that. He's probably around 20/30 in this",
            "So it is him? I could have sworn his species had human lifespans but I guess they are changing that? Or I could just be wrong.",
            "YES YES YES FINALLY THANK YOUUUUUU",
            "Legends birth year he was like 70 during ROTS. \n\nIn this he is a Jedi master in 132BBY so he could be like 30 idk. So then like 140 ish in ROTS",

            "My theory is that the Sith is Qimir, am not a fan of it but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I enjoy his more incapable character traits and making him a Sith Lord is just too much of a power swing upgrade.",
            "Ki-Adi-Mundi was so shook by the events of this episode that even 100 years later he's obsessed with attacks on Wookiees.",

Now Qimir is left hanging BUT when the jedi get to where they heard Mae, one of them says \"she can't have gotten far\". If Qimir was still trapped and hanging, they definitely would have seen/heard him and found him. But they didn't, so he had freed himself by then (allegedly to force speed to the Wookie). I think the Sith will kill a few redshirts, then when it looks like a main character is about to eat it, Mae will jump in against the Sith to save them and Osha will get taken by the Sith and then we start the flip flop of Mae and Osha switching sides.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nWe mods are here because we love Star Wars, with a few that are here to mainly help with bigger events.  We are passionate about the sub, the discussions, the universe, and enjoy most of the people here.  We want to be welcoming to *almost* everyone and hope you will be too.  However, if you want to be disrespectful towards others here, this may not be the community for you.  \n\nWe wanted to post a reminder on how we expect members to treat each other.  It is listed on the sidebar rules as well, the general \"respect fellow redditors\" rule.  We want to clarify things because it seems sometimes people are shocked/angry when we remove and or ban people who don't follow it.\n\nFirst off, you and the mods may have different opinions on what respect is.  So here is a general guideline.  If you wouldn't say it to your mother, your grandma, your boss, etc; don't say it here.  And yes, I get there are one-offs in those scenarios, but to further hammer this home, here are some recent examples right from the ban log:\n\n* Why, does it hurt your feelings? Well too bad, snowflake.\n* You, sir, are what we call a god damn moron.\n* How's that small pee pee working out?\n* Jfc you lack some serious reading comprehension skills...Click and scroll to see his producer credits: Idiot...Pick up a book some time, you\u2019ll learn a thing or two.\n* Stop being a d|#k\n* Dude get a life, nobody f*%*ing cares\n\nOur general guideline is, **30 day bans for any of this**.  Sometimes if its borderline, and if the poster doesn't have a history of disrespect in their profile, we may ban for less.\n\n- If someone is uncivil towards you and you react the same way towards them you are likely both going to get banned.  (use the report function instead)\n\n- If we have to ban you twice for being uncivil, the 2nd one is likely going to be permanent.\n\n- If you get banned, and then message the mods with the same kind of disrespect, the ban will be changed to permanent as well.  \n\nWe get a lot of flack for enforcing the rules, I get it, we are never going to make everyone happy.  We also encourage you all to help out when you see this kind of content and report it, because no, we don't see everything. At the same time, don't abuse reports. Just because you don't like someone's comments doesn't mean it breaks the rules. Offenders may not get banned the same day they break the rules, and we may not reply to modmail complaints right away either.  If we feel we have made our point and don't want to continue to argue, there is a good chance we will mute the discussion in modmail. We may take a further review sometimes on request, and we do overturn things once in a while as well; some scenarios may warrant that.  We aren't reviewing things 24/7 real time, so please be patient. \n\n**As Star Wars fans, and just as people in general, we will have disagreements, different opinions, arguments; not everyone will like what you like.  And that's fine, it can even be healthy.  But showing a lack of respect towards your fellow redditors here is not.  Keep that in mind going forward before you hit that submit button.**",

Beru remained steadfast and continued the family's work with the White Suns even as Cliegg and Owen dealt with the loss.[7] After some time, Cliegg was determined to continue the life he had worked hard to create on Tatooine[5] and began working to make the Lars homestead an oasis of security in the desert,[13] but he quickly began to fade as the tragedy continued to weigh him down heavily. The once-strong man became weak even as time passed since Shmi's death,[1] and he died from the wounds he received from the Tuskens[2] and of a broken heart not long after her death.[5] Cliegg's body was, like Shmi's, placed in a coffin and buried next to hers. The Lars homestead was bequeathed to Owen and Beru,[15] who married and sought to continue the family's traditions.[17]\n\nhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cliegg_Lars#cite_note-Ultimate_SW-2",
