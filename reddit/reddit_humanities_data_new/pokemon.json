Going onto it today, though seems to bring up some dork who I assume must've taken the domain name to sell people used 3DS and Nintendo products I remember using the site once or twice just to be able to make a cute little Pok\u00e9mon and then I would be able to trade it to myself so I guess the best thing l'm looking for is something that is a Pok\u00e9mon generator and saves to a .PKM file so I could put it in Shiny 2-1/2 and traded to myself. I'm sure if you look it up you can see they had a pretty nice interface that made it pretty easy for someone like me who doesn't really know that much about the inner workings of Pok\u00e9mon (like IVs or EV's).\n\nDoes anyone know if there are any other sites like this or better yet if PokEdits is still up because l've tried looking at the wikiHow page that sends you straight to the page and I seem to always get the message saying that the site took too long to respond. I've even tried looking through some YouTube videos, a would get the same response when I tried click on their link to the site. Archive did not work either.\n\n(if this looks familiar because I posted this as a regular post and it got taken down and the moderators told me to post here)",

Then place it sinking deep in the background, so that it gives depth and variety to the background while paying homage to the old iconography. \n\n\nWhy pre-1815 portraits:\n\u201cAfter defeating Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain was left without any major international rivals. In the century that followed, the Royal Navy was instrumental in maintaining this global dominance, but its role and technology underwent a rapid evolution.\n\nSailing ships were replaced with steam-powered vessels, which were primarily employed in surveying, peacekeeping and policing rather than conflict. This shift had consequences for naval portraiture. Artists had to develop new imagery to reflect emerging areas of naval activity, such as polar exploration. Fewer and fewer portraits adhered to the age-old formula of showing a naval officer on the seashore.\u201d - Royal Museums Greenwich\u2019s \u201cA history of naval portraiture in six artworks\u201d",

You might find an artist whose work looks incredible, but does not look like what you want, so they might not do the job you want (if they're really good but it's not in their wheelhouse, I'd hope they'd say so). Google local shops, check the shops' Instagrams, look at each artist. It takes some time, but you'll find the right one *if* you think it needs fixing.",
