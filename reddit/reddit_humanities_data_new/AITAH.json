They aren\u2019t exactly on good terms but they don\u2019t hate each other. So ever since I moved in with my father because of money issues with my mother she has been a constant nag. Like a controlling boyfriend. Always wanted to know where I\u2019m at and who I\u2019m with and at what time I\u2019m anywhere besides home(which is with my father). Usually I don\u2019t mind it since I relatively don\u2019t go out as much because I\u2019m an introvert. But I got a boyfriend 6 months back and have been actually having a social life since then. Now it feels like my mother is trying to keep me on a leash even tho I don\u2019t live with her. She never wants me out after dark and threatens me every time I\u2019m not home before 5 o\u2019clock on the dot. She also doesn\u2019t want my boyfriend picking me up from college nor me going by him at all. So today I went by my boyfriend(with my father\u2019s permission) and met my mum in front of the house. She told me to tell him go home and for me to come inside. She was very pissed off. I tried to walk off because she started shouting at me. She then slapped me. When I told her to please don\u2019t hit me she got even angrier and tried to do it again. I caught her hand and held it so that she wouldn\u2019t hit me again and my father had to intervene because she started shouting like a cavewoman saying that I was \u2018disrespectful\u2019 for telling her to not touch me.

            "Jailbird\n\nSo my best friend and I have been besties since 11th grade, we\u2019re both 27/28 females. We have a very long history of partying, and getting in trouble together, where there was one of us- there were two of us. \n\nA few years ago I (27f) had gotten completely sober, met the love of my life, had a baby and really got my life on the right track. \n\nMy friend however (28f) has really hit rock bottom dealing drugs, doing drugs, stealing and has been in and out of jail A LOT in the past 3 years. This past year things started to change as she got out of jail, and started staying away from a really bad group of people we used to hang out with and I was beyond proud of her! So much so that I invited her out to my bachelorette party. \n\n2 weeks ago her mom called me crying, and told me she was hanging out with the bad group again, and drinking heavily- so much so it put her in the hospital. Last week my friend went out of state with a few of the people from that group, got drunk, and was arrested for theft and public intoxication. She didn\u2019t want to tell her current probation officer, so she wouldn\u2019t get in anymore trouble. The people of the group left her in jail, out of state and no way home. \n\nI took it upon myself to call her probation officer and let her know what the situation was, because no one is looking out for her and her family pushes all her wrongdoings under the rug, but I know if she keeps up with this life, she will end up dead and no one seems concerned with that. My friend is now doing 6 months in jail and a rehab/mental health facility (it was between that and prison time as she is now a felon) \n\nAITAH for calling probation on her? No one knows it was me except my fianc\u00e9 and my mother. My fianc\u00e9 was proud of me for making that call, but my mom said I should just stay out of it.",

My brother (Raph) is very similar to me in the context that we both are very outgoing and like to talk to people, even strangers. I'm taking a nap when he wakes me up to tell me something important, he seems amused to tell me if I knew this girl named Mari as they had met at a coffee shop, apparently, she was talking about a friend name Minjae(22F) and in our town we don\u2019t have many Minjaes. Minjae is a mutual friend of Mari and I; however, we have never gotten along because Mari is jealous/possessive of anyone who tired to be friends with Minjae.

She said I don\u2019t know. So, he then said Val is my sister. Raph asked why I disliked her so much so Immediately I told him he doesn\u2019t want to go there with her as not only do we have some kind bad blood but because of her possessive nature; every single friend she has ever had according to Minjae has left her/ not wanted to be her friend. I told ralph of other instances where she had been pushy and inconsiderate of people\u2019s feelings, I told him she doesn\u2019t like me, and I truly don\u2019t want you to see/hangout with her but you\u2019re a grown adult and could do as you please.

            "hi, so this is very fucking difficult for me to type out so please ignore any spelling mistakes I\u2019m nervous asf. \n\nSo I am the oldest of three siblings. I have a little brother let\u2019s call him sam he\u2019s 16 at the time of this incident and a little sister let\u2019s call her Lilly she\u2019s 12 at the time. \n\nI was placed in the foster care system when I was 14 (Sam 12 Lilly 8) and I hardly had any contact with my family apart from special occasions until I was 18. \n\nI reconnected with my siblings and found out that they were both also put in care but no one would tell me why. I was in care due to being physically abused by my father. so I assumed the same thing happened to them. \n\nJune of last year an old family friend reached out to me and we were talking about how our lives have been ext and he mentioned how close he was with Sam until recently so I asked if he knew why he was placed in care. \nHe told me that Sam got Lilly pregnant. I was so fucking angry, disgusted and physics sick! They are full siblings. She was fucking twelve and he was 16!!! So as you can imagine I was fucking fuming. \n\nI messaged Lilly and asked if it was true she proceeds to send me pictures of her child. my body went numb I didn\u2019t say another word I saved the pictures and called Sam\u2026 \u201chi Sam.. how\u2019s your kid?\u201d I asked trying to hide my frustration \u201cwhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Was his response. I let him have it I called him every name under the sun the thought of it made me throw up again he hung up and blocked me on everything. \n\nMy brother was always super fucking weird but I didn\u2019t know it was this bad\u2026 Lilly told me that I walked in on them when I was younger and the memories flooded back. I remembered exactly what I saw my dad was working so he left me in charge of this kids I must have been 12 or so at this time. Making Lilly 6 and Sam 10 or 11. \nI remember walking into my dads room and finding them both laying in bed Lilly looked red in the face and I could see her bare shoulders sam was getting off of her as I walked in. I assumed they were fighting as always but decided to call beca into the bedroom we shared. I sat her down and asked her what Sam was doing she was just crying saying that she didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble I recorded this conversation to send it to my dad I did this a lot to show dad how they were behaving while he wasn\u2019t home like if I told them to go to bed and they wouldn\u2019t ext. Well I didn\u2019t end up sending him the video I must have forgotten. I didn\u2019t mention anything to do with what I saw. \n\nI found that video in my google photos and it broke me. There was an ongoing investigation into what was going on with them so I decided to get intouched with the private investigator write a statement and give her the video. \n\nWhen the video was shown in court my mother saw and called me drunk out of her mind. She told me that this entire situation was my fault for not telling an adult. She accused me of watching what was going on and liking it. She disowned me told me that I am a lowlife scum and she never wants to talk to me again. \n\nI was twelve and didn\u2019t know what exactly I was seeing? So Am I in the wrong for not telling my dad what I saw? Is this my fault?",

            "AITAH for wanting to blow at my Mom and My Aunt                           I am a 14yr female and My mom and aunt a both in their late 20's and early 40's. My mother has always hated to lose weight and look slimmer and look younger. Not I am against this not my problem.  She has been making progress but as all weight loss journey's go my mom has been feeling the urge to eat more due to heavy calorie restriction. Cut to the present, I was in the kitchen doing my math homework when my Mom pulled a scale and weighed herself. she wasn't happy with the result then ask me to weigh myself on the scale. She knows I am insecure about my appearance and often says contradicting things, for example one day she will give this motivational speech about not caring about what others think and love myself etc then later she'll comment or joke about my weight. I don't find it funny at all but can't say anything as I live in a African household where most times when I try to voice my opinion I get written of as disrecpectful and my aunts always says things like \" Oh you think you that girl now, right you think your all grown up cause your 14 right?\" and whenever I try to tell her its not like that she tells me that\" you don't always have to reply or argue back just listen\" but how does she want me to listen to her and hear her side perspective when she doesn't care about mine?   Anyways after my Mom saw her results and wasn't too happy about it she says \" come and climb the scale\" saying something along the lines of seeing who she can 'put down' to make herself feel better.   I climb the scale I am not happy at all and it shows she tells me to 'lighten up' and smile. I climb on it and I am an overweight teen and I am working on my health but I focus more and school and plan to focus more on working on myself for summer break. I have never been in a good mentally head space since middle school bullying. on multiple occasions my counselors recommended getting me a therapist, but when we get home she asks me why should go to a therapist? that it's a waste of money.  These incidents have put me in an even darker head space, I began to force myself to throw up the food I ate, stole some slimming pills and self harmed. I am the eldest so I have no one else to talk to so I just kept these feelings bottle but today she did it again. I tried to calmly tell her to stop but she got all upset and said \" did you just tell me to stop? would you say that to your father? you always do this but when you need help I'm the one who helps you.\" My mom isn't bad we just don't see eye to eye on some topics like my fashion style, choice of music, personality etc. My Aunt can be dramatic somethings so she just blows the whole thing out if porportion saying that \" Leave her alone she thinks she big now, This is her ways of rebeling\" I wanted to snap at her but this was my stepmom's sister and starting out my stepmom and I never had a good relationship and it was mainly my fault so I try to rekindle the relationship but I always seem do f\\*ck up everytime.\n\nAm I the A\\*\\*hole?

They have depended on me as an emotional sounding board for years, and recently, our conversations have progressed from \"Woe is me\" to something much darker that I really can't put an accurate name on. Not suicidal, but \"cleansing the universe and rebooting it\" phrasing. Made me want to call my cousin's parole officer to give them a heads up, but family and friends urged me to leave it alone. I know I am not responsible for managing my cousin's emotional needs, but finally blocking them from calling and texting makes me feel like I have abandoned them in a great time of need - and the eternal \"if you can't count on family, who can you count on?\" guilt. So am I the A\\*\\*H\\*\\*\\* for blocking my cousin's calls to save my own mental health - and possible physical safety?",

His mom (kind of a busy body type but can be helpful at times) invited us for dinner and said she has an important request to make.\n\nShe brought her request up at dinner table and blatantly said that she wanted to be in the delivery room with me when I give birth. I was taken back by her request -- I really thought it had something to do with the nursery or diaper brand. I said I was sorry but only my mom and my husband will be there. She made a face, got quiet for a while then brought it up again. just kept pushing saying she is as much of a grandmother as my mom and that she just wanted to be there for support and get the opportunity to see her grandbaby's first moments. my husband sided with her.\n\nI just stared at her and said \"it's alright, you can have the opportunity to be in the delivery room when it's your son who's giving birth\". everyone stopped eating and my mother in law left the table in an instance. My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave.\n\nIn the car, he lost it on me asking \"what brain cell\" made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming.\n\nHe's been ignoring me when I try to talk to him and act like I'm not in the room. I think I might have gone too far and created tension by responding inappropriately. AITA?\n\nEDIT/ there has been some tension between me, my husband, and his family lately this probably blew up because of built up resentment",

If you can't accept that and respect that then fine don't be in the room you can wait in the waiting room with your mom and wait hours till I feel like having guest come in or you can realize that your wife's comfort comes before your mothers desire. \n\nAfter that depending on how he responds I would be letting the hospital know that his mother is not allowed in and if he continues to be an AH I would tell him he's not allowed either.  Then I would also make sure that my mother is the one who can make medical decisions for me in case something happens because I wouldn't trust him with that. \n\nHell truly if it was me I would make him go live with his parents for a while till I trusted him again,  cause for me when a partner chooses his parents over your desires and comfort in a situation like this,  I wouldn't be able to trust them for a long time. \n\nGood luck OP I hope you have a safe and smooth delivery.",

The most important thing for you and the baby during delivery is your comfort; much to the shock and dismay of your husband and his precious mother. If your blood pressure fluctuates it affects the baby. If your heart rate fluctuates it affects the baby. How you feel can literally affect how fast or slow your labor progresses. It has to do with your hormones as well as tension in your body.\n\nThis is not about who gets to see the birth of the baby. That\u2019s secondary. This is about who will be the best and most supportive to you as you push a baby the size of a small oblong watermelon through a hole that opens to 10cm with some added stretches and possibly tears. This is about the pain you will be in and how long you will be in that pain, without sleep and likely without eating in case your medical team determines you need a cesarean. (Not suppose to eat before surgery for safety.) This is about who will support you through the physical, emotional and psychological exhaustion of labor to having your baby.\n\nDo not give in to your MIL. If you do, it won\u2019t be the last time. The sense of entitlement to your body and watching you at your most vulnerable is ridiculous. You are not an incubator, you are a person and your comfort and health should be paramount to everything else. Your husband should be on your side and instead he\u2019s choosing to be a mama\u2019s boy. Tell him he is welcome to be with his mother when you give birth or in the waiting room-his choice. Tell him you will be informing the hospital staff that his mother is not allowed in your birthing suite during your labor or immediately after you give birth. When she is welcomed you will inform them.\n\nOnly allow who you truly feel comfortable being completely naked and in pain in front of with you in the room. If you husband puts up a fight, ask him to get completely naked and use the bathroom in front of your mother or undergo a prostate exam in front of her. Ask your MIL if her MIL was present during her labor and delivery. If/when she says no, ask why she thinks she\u2019s entitled to the privilege of being anywhere near you during yours.",

Would have to insist he has a turd waiting to go to make it as messy as possible, at least 4 medical staff all peering up there, his mum, OPs mum and OP in there too. Maybe he needs to be constipated just to add pain into the mix (one torn anus please). It lasts 8 hours then we all get to watch his anus get stitched back up. BOOM!",

Her MIL is envious of the other grand mom and wanted to level the field by demanding to have \u00ab\u00a0the same right\u00a0\u00bb. The husband/future dad is willing to miss his own child\u2019s birth because his mom isn\u2019t there.

When she woke up she found out MIL had already held the baby first, gave her a bath & iirc introduced the baby to relatives in the waiting room. Let's just say, had I been that Mom, there would have been one more of my DHs important people who ended up knocked out cold that day. OP, talk to your nurses. With or without your (momma's boy, butthead) husband present, your word is the most important one in the room. Be clear and tell them what you want & who you want to witness it & that you don't give a rat's ass if you're knocked out, no one's word supercedes what you told them. From the sound of it you need to be prepared for those 2 to try a work around sneak attack. Yeah it's your husband's kid but you're pushing it out of YOUR lady parts. The room doesn't go with the person leaving it, it stays with the door. You're the door. No one gets to see inside unless you decide to open it. Once the person is completely gone from the room, it's a bit of a gray area, but in my opinion, that doesn't happen officially until the person is a least a couple months old. Be the door & lock it up tight.",

If this is the case, be respectful but firm with her. Tell her, not this time but that you will give fair consideration should you have more children in the future. Again, be firm that the statement isn\u2019t a guarantee on inclusion in the future.

The midwives were great and he was just a shout away. Plus I didn\u2019t have to see the concern in his eyes.\n\nSince this I am of the opinion that birth is a space for experienced women to help and reassure each other through a traumatic process that needs to be experienced to be understood.

I was holding my new born and the nurses were mostly out of the room at this point or doing other important things, and I needed someone to take my baby, or I was going to drop him.

At one point after I'd just given birth I think there were 3 or 4 people going quickly in and out of the room on top of the doctor who was sewing me up. She was struggling to get the last stitch in, I was losing blood, somebody had to weigh the bloody tissues to see how much blood I was losing, somone else was weighing baby, cleaning her and giving her her Vitamin K, the midwife was there to then help me breastfeed baby and then to top it all off I threw up like something from the Exorcist as a delayed reaction to the stuff they give you to make the placenta detatch. So some more people had to come and clean that up and clean up the poor doctor.\n\nAll this in a room that was maybe 5m x 5m? So add in another pair of grandmothers freaking out at all the blood and it's a bad combo.

I am worried and scared enough as it is and the last thing I need is the person who is supposed to be at my side through all this is now abandoning me at the last minute. My mom is going to be there because you two are the people I trust more then anything in the world - my mom is there for me as my support not just there for the baby. Do you see the difference?

At one point she got threatened with a removal by the nurse because she was scaring me so bad with her questions about the surgery and the \"what ifs\". When the baby was born she came to recovery, took over 2 dozen photos of my not even 30 minute old baby and was just so obnoxious the nurses basically made her leave so I could rest.

I'll tell her right now to fuck off\". I was like... no she's all I got rn. I rly wanna see her. lol. my exes grandmother made it shortly after but i was trying to get my son to latch so they turned her away without even asking me (it wasnt personal but very important that he latch). finally my ex mil made it up to the hospital and they had their ways of making sure she wasn't smothering me too much. they literally live for this stuff. \n\n(also im an rn and while i know nurses in l&d, i don't work in l&d).",

Did exactly the same when my son was born too but that was a much shorter labour of less than an hour from start to finish. I also cut the cords on both of my kids. Cried tears of joy holding my kids for the first time. It was me handing our babies to my ex for her first hold once they were cleaned up, dressed weighed etc. I think she appreciated that as she could have some time to clean herself up have a drink or what ever and rest before the afterbirth etc. When that came I was.sitting there supporting her still while holding our baby. So don't rule out what you may or may not do until the time comes. If you don't like blood and guts you may prefer the clothed end.

Personally i think withholding food/ water from a laboring person is cruelty, especially when few instances require a full sedation c-section. \n\n I've been on both sides of this fence, 1st. as a young nurse i witnessed a doctor assault their laboring patient and then a decade later when giving birth to my third son, i was asked permission to manually maneuver one edge of the cervix by the OBGYN. At first, i didn't answer (amusingly, hoping she'd change her mind about the necessity) and when she asked a second time she waited until i agreed.",

The foster system is rife with abuse and neglected children though. Even where the children are loved, they can have a lot of trauma. (A partner had two parents who were both drug addicts and alcoholics, and spent much of her childhood in an orphanage. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. ) Knowing that, even if I had such religious before, I'd probably go for an early abortion if I was not able to have children in the circumstances I was in. I imagine. \n\nAs it is, I can't have children. I had radiotherapy to the abdomen to treat cancer, and stopped menstruating 2 years ago. More like 3, come to think of it. It is still really hard, because I really wanted to have children, and adoption is not an option for me and my husband due to various reasons \ud83d\ude14 \n\nI'm thinking about volunteering at a library or something, then I can at least be around kids and have some in my life.",

My second was better in terms of hospital staff etc, and even though my (ex) husband was off coked out and fucking everything with legs while he was apparently \"finishing the baby room\" the same night our second was born, I was just so euphoric that nothing could have brought me down .. not even that lol fun situations",
            "To be completely fair to my husband, he took everything in stride, up to the point during my c-section when he heard my guts squirming about out of my body. This man hates seeing me in pain, especially in pain that he can't fix. So for him to weather through my contractions for 4 hours, my groans and screams, was more traumatic for him than the smell. \n\nThe epidural was sweet relief for me, and then my morbid curiosity wanted to peek over the curtain, but couldn't because I had to stay still. Hubby saw the handles of the spatulas used to hold me open over the edge of the curtain, he was sitting on a tiny stool next to my head, and he went so pale I thought he was gonna faint. Then a bit green at the sound, and I told him it was fine, it didn't hurt at all, and that he didn't have to look. He nodded, squeezed my hand tighter, and told me he loved me over and over until our son was born, then he was the first one to hold him. Hubby brought him to me while doc got me closed up, and we cuddled.\n\nSo honest real talk here. You will be so wrapped up in the emotional ride, you will not notice the gross stuff. Or at the least, you should be wrapped up enough that it's easy to push the gross stuff from your mind. If you don't think you could handle seeing the gross stuff, that's OK. You won't be forced to catch the baby, or cut the cord. The Doctor may ask if you want to, sometimes as a joke about catching the baby, but they won't make you feel bad about not cutting the cord. My hubby wasn't comfortable with that, so he didn't. \n\nI was too focused on the pain and my breathing to notice how gross I was, and once the epidural was doing its thing, I was too focused on the nurses and doctors. It wasn't until after Hubby had followed a nurse to take the baby to the nursery and I was still in the OR, that I noticed how gross I was, how thirsty and hungry I was, and the smell hit me. I asked the nurse when I could take a shower, and she said as soon as the epidural wore off and I could walk normally again. It was bliss. \n\nAnd a new mom tip for you: keep the lights in your room dim for the first few days. Baby's eyes will be sensitive. Our son is 6 months, and still hates really bright lights. But he is slowly transitioning from a vampire to a morning person, much to me and hubby's dismay, since we are night owls ourselves, lol."

        "content": "I (34F) recently lost my sister (41F) to cancer. It was devastating, and I'm still processing the grief. My sister was a single mom to three kids: Jake (14M), Emma (12F), and Lily (8F). In her will, she named me as the guardian for her children.\n\nHere's where things get complicated. I've never wanted kids of my own. I love my nieces and nephew, but I've always been the \"fun aunt\" who takes them out for ice cream or to the movies. I've never had to be responsible for major decisions about their lives.\n\nI have a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, often working 60+ hours a week. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment in the city, which is perfect for me but definitely not suitable for three growing kids. My lifestyle involves a lot of travel and late nights at the office. I'm also in a relatively new relationship (10 months) with my loving boyfriend, who's childfree by choice like me.\n\nWhen my sister first told me about her decision to name me as guardian, I expressed my concerns. I told her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that role because I didn\u2019t think my boyfriend, job, and lifestyle wouldn\u2019t survive it. She assured me that it was just a precaution and that she was sure she'd beat the cancer. I didn\u2019t press the issue because I thought/hoped she would beat the cancer, and also because I wanted her to remain optimistic. We never really had another serious conversation about it.\n\nNow that she's gone, I've told my family that I don't think I can take the kids. I've suggested that our parents (mid-60s, retired) take them instead, or possibly our older brother (40M) who has two kids of his own and lives in a large house in the suburbs.\n\nMy family is furious with me. They say I'm selfish and that I'm abandoning the kids when they need someone the most. They argue that it was my sister's dying wish for me to raise her children and that I'm \u201cpissing all over\u201d her memory by refusing. My parents say they're too old to raise young kids again, and my brother claims he can't afford three more children.\n\nThe kids themselves are understandably upset and confused. Jake, the oldest, overheard a conversation among family members and then Skyped me, visibly upset, saying that I'm abandoning them just like their dad did (he left when Lily was a baby).\n\nI feel absolutely terrible about the whole situation. I love my nieces and nephew, and I want what's best for them. But I honestly don't think I'm equipped to raise three kids. I\u2019m also dealing with my own grief, and I'm worried that if I take them in I'll end up resenting them or not giving them the care and attention they deserve.\n\nI've offered to contribute significantly, financially, to their care, whoever ends up taking them in. I've also said I'd still be involved in their lives as their aunt, but I just don't think I can be their full-time guardian. My brother told me my life has changed and that I need to embrace it. I feel trapped with no way out, and most of my days are spent crying.",

            "NTA - but your brother and parents are also abandoning them too, this isn\u2019t solely on you! They ain\u2019t even trying to come up with a compromise.\n\nYou have offered to help with finances, so your brother\u2019s reasons have now been met, also your parents could take them every other weekend. \n\nYou\u2019re a lawyer!! Make the argument! Your brother is the best candidate! You won\u2019t pass a social services inspection and checks! (Play on that!).",
            "NTA - truthfully throwing 3 kids who lost their mother, and whose father abandoned them at someone who wanted to be childfree is a recipe for disaster. They are going to have emotional issues that are more than just making sure they live in a safe environment with their needs met. You are going to give up your job, bf, home and perceived future for them, so now there are 4 people living together in emotional hardship. This will be harder for you to manage than it would be for someone who just gave birth to 3 kids. This is the reason your brother and parents don\u2019t want the responsibility. They\u2019ve had kids and know how hard it is going to be in this situation, and they don\u2019t want to deal with it. They\u2019re banking on you being ignorant to that, and hope you can be guilted into being the sacrifice. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, but as a parent , I want you to know what you\u2019re stepping into before you decide. Your experience as a parent won\u2019t be like your parents or your brother. It   Is going to be exceedingly tough, so think carefully for all four of your sakes before you choose.",
            "You should, of course, have kept pressing the issue until it was clearly agreed when you had the chance. I don't know how \"binding\" the (un)agreement is on you, but of course the children's welfare is paramount and a foster parent who doesn't want the kids (for very sound reasons, I agree) is not the best solution. The sibling with the big house and existing family seems best. NTA at all.",
            "How do people think you will be able to afford the care of three children if you sacrifice your career?\n\nNTA. I kind of think your sister was a bit TA because you tried to tell her and she just\u2026ignored you? And your brother\u2019s comment\u2026wow.",

You refuse to dedicate your life to a dying person\u2019s selfish \u201clast wish\u201d - if your sister cared as much about her kids as you\u2019re supposed to, she would have found a different guardian when you told her you\u2019re uncomfortable with it.\n\nSee, I\u2019m not involved, so I can be the asshole and state the obvious here.\u00a0",
            "NTA. Having someone who isn't interested in or wanting to raise kids take over three young kids is a terrible idea.\n\nFirst, for your brother, raising the kids would likely provide social security benefits & you could probably contribute significantly as well for the cost of raising them.\n\nFor your parents, they have the time & should support them.\n\nAnd finally, WTF is wrong with your family that they can't keep this wrangling away from the kids.",
            "NTA. Your parents are not that old and it\u2019s not like the kids are tiny babies. Also, how do they expect you to provide for the kids financially when you lose your job from it being able to fulfill all your work commitments bc you now have 3 kids? I\u2019m so sorry your sister passed on but it was shitty of her to even put you in this postion in the first place.",
            "Really tough situation. Was there any estate left? Will the rest of the family contribute to the care of the kids, or are you expected to shoulder all of it? Also depends how generous your income is - is a live-in nanny and a larger apartment doable on your income? Do you live in the same area as your sister? Also.. sorry for your loss.",
            "How did you find out you were named as guardian in your sister\u2019s will? Did you read it yourself or were you just informed? Are you sure you were actually named guardian? \n\nWhen most people set up a guardianship in their will, they usually name several people, provide an explanation as to why they were chosen, and outline guidance for how they want them raised. *Even if you are named as guardian in a will, you are allowed to decline the role.*\n\nI think you need to retain an attorney who specializes in guardianship to review the will to see exactly what was specified. As I understand it, the court will look at many factors to determine the best situation for the kids. A single woman *who doesn\u2019t want kids,* lives in a small city apartment, works 60 hours a week, and would take the kids only out of a sense of obligation is going to look a lot less favorable than the brother\u2019s position of having experience raising children, has a family home, and a two-parent household.\n\nYour sister\u2019s estate can set up a trust for the kids to help out financially, you have offered  monetary support, and the children\u2019s father should be held accountable.\n\nYou have an incompatible lifestyle for raising children and I personally don\u2019t think you should change your entire life\u2019s trajectory when there are other options - including foster care/ adoption by a non-blood relative. You and your family can still be very active in the children\u2019s\u2019s lives with the proper agreement of the foster family. My sister\u2019s grandchildren went into foster care (parents had mental health and drug usage issues) and my sister and her husband see the kids regularly. The kids are all together, well adjusted, and very happy.",

            "Would it be possible for the father to take on any responsibility? \n\nAs you had admitted, you should have been more clear about saying no. However, I don\u2019t understand how the rest of your family isn\u2019t offering to help at all while you\u2019re all in this transitional phase. I don\u2019t think this situation has to be totally one person caring for the kids 100%. Ideally now would be the time for everyone to come together and make sure the kids are taken care of, including their father, if that\u2019s possible.",
            "NTA.  You live in a 1 bedroom apartment and work 60 hours a week.  How exactly do they expect you to make that work?  I know everyone is grieving but they all have their heads up their asses if they think it's even possible for you to take care of those kids.",
            "Those poor kids, no one wants them. I can't fathom their sorrow over their mothers death combined with their flesh and blood fighting over who has to take them like they are dogs that need to be rehomed",

Your decision means they now have to make a decision, and likely one or the other will reluctantly step up.\n\nI don't want to speak ill of the dead, but your sister knew this was coming.  She is the one who should have made the necessary arrangements for the care of her children.  This was a horrible thing for her to do to people that she loved.\n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this.  It's just horrible.",
            "NTA: Honestly you need a family lawyer to handle this not people in a reddit sub. \n\nAnd your sister willingly ignored your concerns when she named you as a guardian for her children. \n\nYou've stated you don't want that responsibility and with you working so many hours it wouldn't be best for the kids either. \n\nAnd with you living in a place that small there is 0 room for the kids either. You'd have to either buy or rent somewhere else and move, while trying to take care of the kids and hope everything goes correctly while everyone is still trying to process the death of your sister.",
            "This story sounds strongly inspired by that Kate Hudson movie, Raising Helen.",
            "Your sister should have asked you, not told you. You should have said no at that point. \nIt\u2019s completely fair that you don\u2019t want the responsibility alone, the whole family needs to step up. \nThe reality is these kids just lost their whole world and now their closest family are arguing because no one wants them.\nAs a corporate lawyer, you must be well versed in compromise. Work out a solution with your parents and siblings, those kids need love and support however much that disrupts your lives. I\u2019m sincerely sorry for your loss. Life is shit and sometimes there is no easy solution.\nWishing the best for you all.",

If you didn't want them you should have put your feet down when you talked to your sister back when she was thinking about it. After the fact is a little late for that. I can only imagine what those kids are going through (especially after the entire father abandonment thing). I understand this isn't what you planned but I really don't think your parents are a good choice (at their age and especially now that they know you were the designated guardian) and I can only imagine your brothers having to support 5 kids (ouch).",
            "NTA Interesting how they believe everyone else has a valid excuse except you... Move if you have to, but do not break - you'll ruin your life, and the kids will be miserable.",

            "I'm in my mid sixties. That is NOT too old to take care of older children, which these are. And your brother disgusts me. You have offered financial help.

If you were the only relative, I\u2019d say you\u2019d need to make the sacrifice, but in this case with you being single, the others are better suited to do it.  60 is not old and plenty of grandparents have done this.   Your brother is in a good position, especially if you help with finances.  What a selfish lot. Your sister might have asked the others and they declined also.",

They do not need to hear all the adults in their lives continuing to argue over how much a burden they are going to be \u2014 that applies to your parents and your brother as well.   Were you the only one your sister approached?    You need to understand if money is the only obstacle for your brother.

They\u2019re family. \n\nEverybody is so concerned with \u201cI never intended\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not prepared for,\u201d as if these kids intended and were prepared to lose their mother.

Ultimately you are under no obligation to take the kids, your sisters wishes in her will are just that her wishes there is no compulsion on your part to do it if you aren't able.  The fact you've always been the fun aunt is probably what is attractive to the kids and they can't see how things would be different in a full time arrangement, my advice is stick to your guns and don't be bullied into a decision that will not work for you or the best interests of the children.

If his only excuse for not taking the kids is that he can\u2019t afford it, then financial help should solve the problem, right? \n\nIn this case I think it would be fair for you, your parents, and your brother to split the kids\u2019 expenses between you so it\u2019s not on any one person. Have your brother take them in as his contribution, and you and your parents split the rest. Both you and your parents can agree to take the kids for an occasional overnight or fun weekend getaway to give him a break.\n\nThis splits the burden more evenly. It really makes by far the most sense for your brother to take them because he\u2019s not too old and he has actual parenting experience that can benefit these kids. He\u2019s just going to need a lot of help doing it. Offer him as much help - financial or otherwise - that you can manage. While it will take some pf your time and money, it will at least allow you to maintain your childfree lifestyle.\n\nI am very sorry about the loss of your sister, but it simply was not fair for her to announce her decision to make you guardian. That is a decision made *with* someone else, not *for* them. If someone wants you to do something as enormous and life changing as *raising their kids* for them, then they *ask* you, and anything other than \u201cyes\u201d is a no. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with that\u201d is no. Even \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d is no. \n\nThis is something she was morally obligated to get your clear agreement on before naming you as guardian, and she did not do that. She told you what she\u2019d decided, you protested, and both of you ended up letting it drop. The bottom line is that you did not agree to do it, so you are not morally obligated to. \n\nAnyone who is not offering to make a significant sacrifice of their own has no business calling you selfish.

Your parents and brother are calling you selfish, i do not believe you are, i think you were put in an impossible situation and unfortunately you didn't speak up on time and your sister didn't understand that you were serious. I will say this for all of you, do you guys want those kids out of your family? The living members of your deceased sister, the last piece and earthly connection to her ? You need to sit down with your parents and brother and make it clear they know that you will not take those kids and yes they will end up in Foster care and if they do, they should also know that they are to blame as well as they also didn't step up for them, if your sister had changed her will it would surely have been either your brother or your parents and they are next of kin soooo before they blame you, they should also start blaming themselves for not stepping up when family needed them, their own blood.\n\nAlso id go after the father, he is technically the first next of kin so try to locate him if none of you will take those poor kids.\n\nI hope you find peace in whatever decision you make and that those kids find love and comfort that they desperately need rather then feeling lost and unwanted like they probably feel right now, especially since they lost their rock and comfort so young. My condolences for your loss.",

Even in the best case- if there is enough space for every kid to have an own room and your SIL is a stay-at-home-patent- it will not be easy. Do you know how much work it is to manage a family with 2 kids? Bring the kids to their sport,  music clubs, play dates, cook for all, manage appointments or if they are still toddlers the night routine, feeding, less sleep? To manage all events for 5 kids is even harder work. They will need a bigger car for 7 persons. And still that kids have a trauma, they may are not as easy to cope with \u00f6ike everyone is used to. They have to split their time between 5 kids, that means sacrifices for their own 2 kids who are used to have their parents for themselves, could possibly cause some drama at first. Your brothers have another education style and other rules than your sister, so thats hard for everyone, too. And while you have a partner who doesn't want kids, your brother has a wife who wanted 2 kids with her husband and not 5.

No doubt your grief and sadness are being interrupted, and you deserve to mourn on your own terms. I pray your sister is at peace, free of pain, and finally able to rest and that you find your own comfort. Question: \nWhy do you think your sister wanted you to be Guardian, in spite of your objection; instead of your parents or brother? Was it the easiest solution? Did your parents and brother already refuse, and you were the last house on the proverbial block? Those answers won't change the current situation, I know, but I'm curious why she thought you were the best backup. I could be wrong, but it doesn't feel like your family has the children's best interests at heart. And it doesn't appear to be about money if you've offered financial support. Ask yourself why you feel guilty? Is it bc you know the kids' alternative living situations are worse than a one bedroom apartment and a fun aunt who works late nights? I'm not minimizing your situation or your career at all! so please don't take it like that. I'm trying to understand why your sister wanted her children to be with you instead of other viable, practical alternatives, only to help you have more information going forward. If you don't keep the kiddos, who will they live with? Will they have to go into Foster Care? Was there a will that gave you money to help pay for their care? All the posts here suggest that you not take the kids. I don't know if that's even an option. Would you really have to quit your job? Jake is in high school now, and the two littles are old enough to handle their basic needs. If they get Soc Sec death benefits, and with the money you were offing to supplement your parents or brother, could you use that money for a bigger place and nanny or au pair possibly? Can the kids stay with grandparents for business trips and every other weekend?Can you work remotely? Which are you most bothered by? Having to take care of the kids or being forced into a situation by others? Could you take the kids for six months and get them a new routine and a soft place to land while you work on different living arrangements for them? I know this last option isn't what you want, but it may be worth pressing the pause button and give a chance for cooler, calmer heads to prevail. It's unfortunate how things have turned out for you. I'm sad it wasn't finalized before your sister passed away. NTA for your sincere feelings and fears!!! Maybe if we look outside the box, we can brainstorm ideas that dont affect you or the kids negatively, and without you having to sacrifice your life and freedom and independence. There's a solution here, we just have to figure it out. Best wishes,",

Now that trust has been broken for both the dead and the living. You should have had the grit to tell your sister your ugly truth while she still had time to ask friends for help.

Not just because of her own trauma but seeing my happy kids with loving parents everyday even though she has been given everything they have, is its own kind of trauma we continue to work through 5 years later and she\u2019s 18. \n\nMy husband\u2019s parents did this with my husband\u2019s cousins. They had two at home and brought in two kids that had lost both of their parents. 25 years later and the wounds that that situation created for the bio kids in that family were tremendous, not to mention almost killing my in-laws marriage because of bringing in their nibblings who needed a lot of help. \n\nOn top of that, your sister\u2019s kids will always feel second best next to their cousins or not loved at all even if they get treated exactly the same because they\u2019ll be faced with kids that still have their parents every single day. \n\nWhen you put kids that have trauma in a house with kids without trauma, everyone gets traumatized. \n\nYou have a lot on your plate. You\u2019ve made conscience choices in your life that leave you emotionally unprepared and perhaps unsuitable for these kids. \n\nThey have a lot in their plate. They have literally no control over their lives whatsoever.  That\u2019s really scary. You have the option to say no to having them.

My point is that you could spend time separately with a partner if they wish. \n\n\nBUT do not take these kids if you cannot commit to it. Your mentality of taking them is that they will ruin your whole life and that's not fair to the kids.

There are probably places with more. People are struggling with cost of living, high numbers of food banks, and lack of support, as well as benefits not providing enough income for those who need it. But the costs of taking in a child are probably much less simply because of the NHS. We don't have to worry about insurance and what cover we can get. So all these services I mention are included in the overall care for anyone who needs them. \n\nIn terms of this situation, there is a child benefit payment  that would be transferred to the guardian (depending on their income) I do not know more details about support packages that the brother would be entitled to.",

Her love of life was infectious. We would go hiking, eat at restaurants, go to theme parks, take walks on beaches, and everything else. We both loved the outdoors.\n\nAbout three years after we got married, my wife started changing. Instead of going out, she began to become something of a couch potato. She gained weight, started sleeping less, stopped cooking, and frankly became kind of a slob. I put up with this for years. I started cooking on most nights, and I had to hide vegetables in her food for her to eat them. I started doing the dishes every night because I knew she wouldn\u2019t. When I went grocery shopping I abstained from buying my favorite unhealthy foods because I knew she would devour them within hours. I tried to encourage her to start taking care of her health.\n\nNothing changed. Ten years ago, I finally reached my breaking point. I sat her down and gave her an ultimatum: \"Start taking care of your health because if it falls apart, I\u2019m not going to be here to take care of you.\" She was very upset with me, saying \u201cIn sickness and in health my ass\u201d repeatedly, but I told her I didn\u2019t care.\n\nAgain, nothing changed. I\u2019ve stayed active. I go jogging every day and maintain a healthy weight. But over the past five years, she has reached a point where she frankly kind of disgusts me at times. It takes her five minutes or more to get up from her typical position of lying down on the sofa. She has started waddling hunched over. She\u2019s 48 but she honestly looks 10 years older and acts 25 years old.\n\nA month ago, I finally got her to go to the doctor (another one of her reckless behaviors is never going in for check-ups). They discovered that she\u2019s on the verge of type 2 diabetes, has a mild case of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and her blood pressure is concerningly high. Naturally, after receiving such news, on the way home from the hospital she swung by a fast food restaurant to get some food and a shake.\n\nThe other day I sat her down and told her that I simply refuse to be a caretaker for someone who\u2019s not even 50 yet. I told her I would be filing for divorce, but left how we do it (either through lawyers or through a cooperative splitting of assets) up to her. She\u2019s absolutely furious with me, and my parents seem to be on her side.\n\nAm I really the asshole here?",

So for two decades your poor wife has been struggling with a serious issue and instead of getting her help and supporting her in recovering you\u2019ve belittled and defeated her, threatened to leave her, and infantilised her.

I didn\u2019t realize just how much he was ignoring at first but once i realized I had to beg him to even test his blood.

She needs mental help as well as help with her health, but no one will be able to do it for her. I work in healthcare and see my share of bitter spouses turned caretaker for someone who didn\u2019t take care of their health. The most heart breaking was a man taking care of his severely morbidly obese wife. She had a myriad of health problems related to living a sedentary lifestyle and obesity due to an addiction to sweets and fast food. Her husband tried for years, then decades, to get her to take better care of herself. When she could drive herself, she\u2019d scream and yell about her husband not giving into having fast food or ice cream, and then take herself. He was fairly fit. When they were in their 50\u2019s, she suffered a minor stroke. She had no lasting physical damage, but completely gave up taking care of herself, instead relying on her husband and family for EVERYTHING. At first, her husband was able to keep her meds in order, and cooked nutritious meals for her. She was still gaining weight, though, and soon couldn\u2019t get around without a scooter or walker. Come to find out, she\u2019d order pizza or have family bring her \u201clunch\u201d while her husband was at work instead of taking herself to the kitchen to heat up the meals he made her. Eventually, he never left the house unless he was at work because of how dependent she was on him. If he was invited anywhere, she\u2019d have a fit and demand he stay home. If he left, she\u2019d throw herself on the floor and say she fell so he\u2019d have to come home. He couldn\u2019t even go to the gym or go for a 30 minute walk. He had no friends. No social life. He started gaining weight. He was constantly finding pizza boxes, candy wrappers, soda cans, etc hidden in her room. He was constantly arguing with her and the family about her health and their enabling her. He was such a bitter man toward the end. He took care of her, but there was an incredible amount of resentment there. We offered respite care, but she refused to have anyone \u201ccome in and tell her how to live.\u201d She died before the age of 60. After she died, her husband lost the weight he\u2019d gained, sold his house, and moved to Florida, something he\u2019d always planned to do when he and his wife were retirement age. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.

He was also verbally and emotionally abusive to all of us and yelled at the tv all day every day while watching Fox News. \n\nHe couldn't take care of her because of where he put himself. My mom decided to cut her losses because she wasn't going to be taking care of him if he refused to get better AND have to take care of herself, and she refused to rely on me to take care of the both of them.\n\nThat being said, has your wife been evaluated for depression? I know it can cause a lot of these issues. If she is depressed, maybe getting treatment for it would help her with taking care of herself again.\n\nMy dad was also depressed but refused to get treatment because he didn't want his guns getting taken. But he's also a narcissist, so idk about what all is in his head. All I know is he's a sad and angry person who I don't talk hardly ever.\n\nAll I personally know is depression can make taking care of yourself feel impossible.",

There's very little that I wouldn't do. \n\nYou cannot save a drowning person who does not want to be saved. They can only drag you down with them. I truly believe in \"in sickness and in health\" because life is uncertain and disabling events can happen to anyone.

Hopefully you would know that while you care about her and want better for her it is not your responsibility to drown alongside her.\n\nFrankly it seems like the only issue is that you have stayed for far far past your breaking point.

Do you truly listen, with care and concern, without blame, anger, or judgment when she voices a problem or dissatisfaction with something in life? Have you ever even asked her WHY she has changed, or if she has any idea what's going on?  \n\nI'm not making assumptions, merely suggesting a possibility I hadn't seen mentioned yet.

It will, on a deep psychological and subconscious level, make her want to not do it purely because she was told to. \n\nAlso, sneaking veggies into her food without her knowledge or consent would also come across as forceful and controlling. Again, triggering reverse psychology. \n\nTry instead asking if she would LIKE to do things like join you at the gym or share a healthy meal together. \n\nBut I guess if you have made up your mind you want a divorce instead of figuring iut what went wrong here.

They deserve the best version of yourself, end of.\n\nAlso, depression is thrown around a lot as if most people didn't experience what it's like. In the world I live in, most people have had depression or are chronically depressed and we still manage, somehow. \n\nThe most obvious after 20 years of this behaviour is that she's just a very lazy person, and very satisfied with being her mediocre self.

During that year I lost 110lbs\u00a0\n\n\u00a0By 2022 I was back to 155lbs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Today unfortunately I\u2019m up to 170lbs. I admitted to myself I have a food addiction and binge eating disorder. I started therapy in October 2023 however I haven\u2019t made much progress. We\u2019ve tried many different approaches it\u2019s just I can\u2019t seem to stick to anything. Medicine for ADHD helped a little but it made me very ill\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Husband also was overweight too. He was 170 when we first started dating and he got up to 265 eventually.

It seems as though he expects her to be something she is incapable of being right now, for numerous reasons, not the least of which being her poor mental health. \n\nI am inclined to think that OP has a penchant for judging his wife without bothering to look deeper into what it is that caused her to do a 180.\n\nIf it were my partner, id absolutely be approaching this from a concern for mental health, not from a place of shame because he isn't happy with the decisions she has made. \n\nAlso, bud didn't reach his limit 10 years ago.

The dog could have bit her or attacked her (for as far as she knew). \n\nIf you violently attack someone or any living animal while pregnant just out of pure spite its wrong. It's not like the dog was attacking her, or the dog has a behavior problem and she had to protect herself because she was pregnant. The dog was well behaved and she chose to hurt it for no reason at all. Even if thr dog did something bad it's not her dog to discipline. \n\nTo me she hurt your child. I don't think kicking her was the right thing to do. I also think if you're reacting to protecting your animal from behavior like that you'll not be expecting any pregnant woman to be kicking peoples dogs either. She seems like a weird moron.

            "Sometimes parents just need to let their kids do it.",
            "So all she does is pay for the dog? If anything I'd say that just makes it the whole families pet, not hers since the other family members put in the time and effort\n\nThat said, she sounds like my ex best friend, constantly referring to all kids as burdens but the moment you point out her clear hate of kids she was like \"how could I hate kids when I've got 7 nieces\" etc\n\nAbsolutely draining to be around tbh",
            "Yeah, and sometimes you just find yourself in bad situation where you have to make snap decisions. Sometimes the right decision involves kicking a preggo ;)",

            "Leo was a nearly 15-year-old dachshund whose owner had Alzheimer's and dementia. Leo was 28 lb, he had Cushing's disease, a prolapsed anus, he had oral nasal fistulas that we couldn't repair because of his age, he had a terrible heart murmur. And he had the worst breath. He could clear out a stadium if he let out a fart. He was the stinkiest boy but he stole every piece of my heart. He was my first truly elderly Foster with major medical issues \n\nIn fact my Instagram is for him @leothewunderhund And I post all my pictures of my fosters in the resident animals there. \n\nI actually wound up adopting him because the thought of not being there and be not being the one to make the decision when it was time for him to go was killing me. He was with me 11 months. He did make it to his 15th birthday and then his little heart just gave out on him and I held him in my arms as he passed and I think he knew just how much I loved him. \n\nAnd that is when I decided that I pretty much wanted to focus on elderly or those with serious medical conditions. Which doesn't mean I don't take in other dogs -- I don't do puppies. My 7 lb Chihuahua will murk them. And I don't do big dogs because again my 7 lb Chihuahua will end them.\n\nYesterday, #53 got adopted. I still have 51 with me she will stay with me until she dies because she has dementia and she's deaf. And number 52 is an 11-year-old toy poodle and I do not understand why she is not adopted yet. She's adorable, she's sweet, She fits in my bra cup",

            "Look at her history post, it's pretty obvious the pregnancy is very relevant here.",
            "she\u2019s also infertile and at one point really wanted a baby so i wonder if that\u2019s part of it",
            "I just checked it out, she just sounds exhausting imo\n\n but pregnant women = bad amirite guys/s"
