            "Good luck with that. \nWe bought a new house about 5 years ago. Almost everything on the market then, and even more now, are connected. It\u2019s called the [Internet of Things (IOT)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and it\u2019s not going away anytime soon. \n\nI tried to reverse the direction of my ceiling fan and couldn\u2019t do it without downloading an app and signing up for an account. It SUCKS!\n\nI don\u2019t use 90% of the features available. Why do I need to remotely turn on my microwave?!  Is it really that hard to stay in the kitchen for the 3 minutes it takes for my popcorn to finish so I need it to send me a notification on my phone?\n\nBuilt in obsolescence in a throwaway economy is lining the pockets of the rich at the expense of the common man.",
            "As a huge geek that's been writing code since the mid 90s and loves technology, I 100% agree.\n\n\nThere's a lot of really amazing useful tech out there, but major appliances that you want to last 20 years aren't the place for it.\n\n\nUnnecesary tech not just a failure point. It's also often plain harder to use and virtually anything that connects to the internet or requires an app is almost certainly collecting data on you needlessly, but also creates more surface area for hackers.\n\n\nI love my bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. I don't want to have to trobleshoot my blootooth connection to make coffee.\n\n\nSamsung doesn't need to know what's in my fridge.\n\n\nAmazon doesn't need to know whats happening in my bedroom.\n\n\nI don't want to replace my toaster because the touchscreen died.\n\n\nJust because its newer doesn't mean its better.\n\n\nSometimes a thing just needs to be a heating element and a switch in a housing.",

Tried leaving it off for a minute did not work so I went to work with it going nuts beeping away about how filter needs changed.

            "Our toaste died about a month ago and my spouse was looking at new toasters at Walmart. All of them had digital displays, and some had wifi. Why the heck you need wifi on toaster makes no sense to me. We ended up getting an $8 toaster from the thrift store with good old fashioned knobs and I couldn't be happier with it.",

Companies can't keep selling you products if they never break.\n\nBuy smart enabled devices if it really makes sense and if you'll genuinely benefit from that functionality. If it'll  be an occasionalky used gimmick, don't bother. More importantly, just do your research on what products are reliable and what brands have good CS. There are lemons everywhere.",
            "Even the more mundane smart devices in my home seem to be getting dumber and dumber. Google Home thinks I\u2019m trying to cancel an alarm every time I ask it about the weather, smart plugs randomly stop working, and wi-fi/bluetooth connected outdoor hose timers take an hour to troubleshoot during setup and randomly stop working.",
            "100% yes to this.  I'm a house cleaner. I have a client that had a like 3 year old oven with a touch screen and the thing was already dying. \n\n  \nQuite honestly, I'd avoid ANY touch button appliances that are ran by microchips.  The chip goes out and you have to buy a new appliance instead of a new part.   Sadly, I think it's becoming really hard to avoid them",
            "I run my LG while returning from work, clothes are dry when I reach home.. Simple drying them saves lot of time",
            "I bought a dumb oven, but all the buttons are on a touch display. I spend way more time screaming at the oven when trying to choose the function than anyone should ever. \nAnd then when I open the door, the vapor comes out of the oven and presses the forking buttons. I hate it with all my heart.",

            "This is how I feel about Smart TVs. Now they're unavoidable. Everything I plug into my TV has all the apps the TV is advertised as having, and 100% of the time they run the apps better than the TV does. \n\nHaving said that, I'm totally interested in smart appliances but them being prone to failure totally sucks. Why does it feel like the better technology gets, the less reliable it becomes?",

            "Just wandering in here. Do not, under any circumstances get an EcoBee thermostat. It's so awesome when you wake up and it's 100 degrees inside because your fucking thermostat crashed. Yes that happens, no you won't notice that it isn't working (other than the obvious extremes) because it's still displaying a temperature, but the temperature is wrong. And then when you tap the control surface it spends the next ten minutes resetting.\n\nSo, yeah. This is a good sentiment in general but a great one when it comes to that brand in particular.",
            "I had a Bluetooth kettle but I'd always forget to put water in it before bed, so I couldn't get the advantage of having it.",
            "Great advice. Dont buy appliances from tech companies, just like wouldn't buy tech from an appliance company.",
            "My dishwasher has a wifi thing on it but I never set it up.  I'm not sure why I'd ever need it.  I'm sure there are people who could get use from that kind of feature, but I sure am not one of them.",
            "Not just \"smart\" stuff, but also touch stuff pisses me off. My new kitchen has the light controls as touch. No chance toggling the lights without looking to hit the precise spot the touch control is at. Controlling the stove top with wet hands? No chance. Putting a platic bag or a pan on top of the touch controls and they go crazy. It pisses me off so much, but the catalog was full of this shit and there were no alternatives. Just questioning the salesman about that made him look at me like I am out of my mind wanting such retro shit like physical control panels.",
            "It heavily depends on the appliance in question. Some things are just better when you can control the over the internet. Others don't make sense. And avoiding touchscreens is getting harder and harder every day.",
            "Too bad it is almost impossible to buy a car that is not connected and has a screen in the dash.  I know there are some exceptions.",

            "My toaster is wifi connected. I can adjust the level, timer, and start it from anywhere in the world. The fact that I'm not there to put the bread into the toaster apparently was not a concern for the designer.\n\nThe factory set password is \"toast\" and cannot be changed. The springs are so tight that the bread and crumbs always bounce out onto the top. The glass view on one side to watch the bread toast gets so hot I'm it will explode at somepoint to offer more crunchy bread. The person who gifted me the toaster clearly hates me.",

            "Totally with you on that. Why on earth would my washing machine need Internet access? I have to be physically in front of it to load and unload it. I'm capable of figuring out when a cycle should be done on my own. What is the benefit? Same for all the other things too. I appreciate HE washers and ovens that turn off at the end of a cook timer but that's all the fancy I need.",
            "I have a bunch of air purifiers.  They're wi-fi connected.  I can start/stop them from a remote.   The app also tells me when it's time to replace the filter and other nifty features.\n\nBut they updated the app with anti-privacy conditions that you had to accept to continue to use the app.  They wanted tons of information.\n\nI deleted the app.  Now I walk to the air purifiers to turn them on or off.\n\nFuck 'em.",

            "Its so weird, cause like....you can. Not like you need to, and it's not exactly a beginner electronics project, but it's not particularly difficult or expensive to break the controls out, wire them into some kind of little microcontroller, and get that communicating with a remote or another computer or whatever. Like...$50 and 8 hours.\n\nThe ones **now** though? The ones that are \"\"\"smart\"\"? Way harder, less flexibility, more difficult to repair to boot.",
            "Agreed. Bought a used AEG for \u20ac50 when we moved, just to avoid a month of laundromats costing more than that. \n\nTurned out to be a great machine and we still have it 4 years later.",

You think you need it nice and slick to release the batter, but in reality there\u2019s oil in the batter so when the oily batter meets the oily pan it just quickly burns. The first pancake lifts that oil layer off the pan so the next one doesn\u2019t have the same issue. \n\nNext time put a tiny amount of oil in the pan and once it\u2019s warm wipe it off with a paper towel so there\u2019s only a slight residue and the pan is almost dry.
