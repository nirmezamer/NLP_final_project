            "I'm completely blind to Ableton live being a Cubase user for writing and not really using playback live. But with my new musical project I *think* Ableton Live is what I need...I'm just not sure yet.\n\nBasically I want to have a collection of outboard gear (modular synths, standalone synths, midi keyboards with VST's, Guitars, Vocals) all being run through channels on Ableton live and allowing me to control parameters and sections live on stage with a push or something. It would be perfect if I could have, like, an intro section that sends midi info to all outboard gear on an 8 bar loop so I can Jam and set synth parameters, then I hit some triggers and it kicks into the song proper. Would be even cooler if I could control when it goes from verse to chorus and such. like a 16 bar loop for verse 1, 8 bar loop for chorus, so on so forth. \n\nThen, I would also love to ability's to build short loops from scratch during the performance in between the songs to kind of glue things together. so think a few minutes of ambient modular synth stuff that build up from scratch, but I'm keeping in mind the settings for the next song so when I hit the intro cure for the next song it moves somewhat seamlessly into it without 5 minutes of frantic patching and twiddling of synth nobs.\n\nIs Ableton Live what I want, or am I dreaming? and then how would I even go about building up a live session like that?",
            "When I have a lot of tracks, sometimes it all sounds like it's crushed and fighting for space - particularly right now I'm working on a song with loads of vocal tracks to get a gang sound and it's painful. Some of my projects do this and some don't. How do I get around that?",
            "I'm getting started in ableton 11 live suite, and have gone through a lengthy ableton course this past year a little bit each weekend and finally finished it - https://www.udemy.com/course/ableton-live-11-course/?referralCode=E73E85500B3C2B28FCCF - and there is a shorter version of it here, but I completed the version that was 21.5 hrs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaSK3Q8vyGA The only instrument I know how to play is the drums, which I'm very proficient in. I purchased a midi keyboard and roland td27kv2 ekit within this past year. For making my own music, could someone provide a specific intro to piano course they'd recommend in a similar course style to the ableton course above - like on youtube or otherwise? I'd like something with different lessons, ideally totalling hours - which if possible is catered to midi keyboard. I'd like a course ideally I can chip away at every weekend in a number of months similar to how I did with the ableton 11 course. Thanks!",
            "Please help!! I have my first live show next Friday night and I want to know if it's possible to feed audio into Ableton in a live setting and use an audio effect as an effects pedal. In my recording of an electronic song I used the Ambidel filter delay audio effect and it smoothed out a bunch of distortion and I can't emulate it with the filter delay effects pedal I bought. I have a USB mixer that I can send the audio into Ableton, but is there a way for that to be heard live?\n\nIs it possible to modulate external sound live in Ableton? Can Ableton be used as a sort of amplifier as well as an effects pedal?",

I want to be able to edit the midi on one of those blocks and have it automatically apply to the other 15 blocks across the track.\n\nIn Figma, they have a mechanic called \u201ccomponent\u201d where you create a master component of an element, and you can duplicate it indefinitely - but if you edit the original master it cascades across every component duplication.\n\nIt saves so much time!",

            "Yes, Live's session view was pretty much made for exactly this sort of thing. You can preconfigure clips and scenes, or build up loops in real time. Set follow actions to automatically move things along, or launch manually with a button press. Push integrates really well with session view, too. I haven't come across any great tutorials (not to say there aren't any?), but there are a few vids out there with artists talking about how they use Live for performance. I found this one helpful when I was trying to learn about live looping a few years ago: [https://youtu.be/6h47KS\\_tsSs](https://youtu.be/6h47KS_tsSs)",
            "Basically what I had in my previous stint, though I never dove in to the Push. I had an Akai mpk49 because I like playing out the notes on the keys. \n\nWhat would you suggest for an interface? I only have thunderbolt on my MacBook. Would a usb converter cause any input lag, or should I go for straight thunderbolt interfaces?",
            "Sort of, I was wondering if there was a hotkey to just play the selected sample that I'm editing. I know you can press c1 on your midi controller (or whatever note it's assigned to), but I prefer to just use my computer keyboard if possible.",
            "Personally have a motu m4 and that fits my workflow nicely as I just have an octatrack going to the m4 and some other gear routed into the octatrack. Like 30 ms of latency from that and the m4 has direct monitoring as well if I want to skip some input lag when listening through on Ableton. But the interface you get really just depends on what your budget is, how much outboard gear you want to route in at the same time, and what your planned workflow is. If your plan is to preform live using Ableton and are live looping your guitar or something, than the extra speed you get from thunderbolt might be something that is warranted. Otherwise if you're just recording in to Ableton you can always shift over the audio in post, if what was recorded is a little delayed.",

It has to be at the right BPM when the clip enters the project, otherwise it won't be the right length later, even if un-warped. It's like it is stretching/condensing the sample to match the project bpm and then if you try to reset it later, it's length/tempo is distorted.
