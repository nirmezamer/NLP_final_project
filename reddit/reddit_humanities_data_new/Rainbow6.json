Changes take not just a long time to do but also TO PLAN TO DO and then is compounded by needing to be approved constantly through multiple administrations usually. A company of that size will inevitably go through hurdles like that, the bigger your studio, the more logistics you have to do.

In a 2v1 situation, Monty plants in site and walks out the door to outside site and then I start walking up to the door (as clash) to block him so my teammate can defuse for free. Instead my teammate rushes past me and goes out the door like half a second before I can block it and dies leaving me in a 1v1 with Monty having the advantage.  I shock him and also shoot him and unbeknownst to me, get him down to like 20 HP but I don't know he that and end up losing because I have to just try and defuse.

Her winrate delta is four times as bad as the next worst character.\n\nShe feels very oppressive a lot of the time but she has a lot of weaknesses that a confident player can exploit. If you think she's broken, then I doubt you're going to play with enough confidence to beat her. Clash's shield is knocked to the right when she is hit. Many Clash players will turn to counter this but it's not perfect. \u200b",
