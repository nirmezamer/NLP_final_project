Used Next on my last one but it's been almost 18 months so I forgot a ton of the functionality, plus v.14 introduced a bunch of different features. I just started a new side project, using next for the frontend. Spent the whole week looking for a project like this one and finally found it last night. Can't believe it's not more well-known. I found it by looking thru a bunch of demos in vercel, but it didn't come up on Googke or Reddit searches. Of course now that I found it on my own, someone posted it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I am still not very comfortable with the overall syntax, styling.\n\n2. These days, if you look at some of the UI/UE out there, they are mind blowing. I dont think I can ever match this.\n\nSo, I want to know how to go about creating next.js applications. Should we pick some existing template and modify it?  Or should I use some headless cms?. Also, vercel has this generative ai based product caled v0 which generates code. ( Personally I dont like such tools. But it increases the producity and we can focus more on the actual use cases, it may be worth considering). How good is this?  Lastly, does copilot help in some way? . Thanks in advance.",
