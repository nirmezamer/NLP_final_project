The subreddit rules also apply here - but we will be much more relaxed about things being slightly off-topic or discussions meandering away from the topic. \n\nWe are also proud, we can provide daily in-depth news and intel briefings again, our user/friend @Hedgehog from our discord server will provide us with those. We will add links each day to this post, as well in the original formatting as an image, or for users not able to read that, as a link to a text-only copy in our wiki.\n\nTo indicate the current version, we will update the flair of this post with the date of the current briefing.\n\n---\n---\n\n#The Daily Hog:\n\n2024-06-08 [Original Format](https://imgur.com/a/FKcuVYG) / [Text

Ideally, soldiers would use the app on their cell phones and attach the device to the top area of their vehicles or to their body while sleeping in the trenches. Keep mind that sim cards must be removed and cell phone wireless connectivity must remain \"off\" in combat environments. Before deployment, soldiers should connect to wifi and start the app. Once the app is started, a soldier can then disable wifi and leave the app running as he/she is deployed into a combat zone. For detecting aerial objects in combat, android phone should be mounted to the top of the backpack or top of the helmet. In civilian environments, the cell phone, with wireless turned on, could be placed on rooftops.

The app will beep when an intruder is detected. The app will also emit voice alert, saying \"intruder detected\" upon detection of an intruder. This app allows phones to be mounted in various places, to which it can detect when an intruder is in the area. This can be used in clearing and counter insurgency operations. This is also useful for the civilian population against thugs and other criminal elements in urban environments. The app can prevent ambush attacks. The phone could be placed in the cracks of walls and other discreet locations.

As far as I've seen, the shrapnels can sometimes completely immobilize or even inflict lethal damage from ~10 meters away.\n\nWith this in mind, I am wondering why I haven't seen any of the Russian troops ever wearing some kind of solid protective face mask or even a helmet with a visor of some sort? Furthermore I suppose there exists some kind of lightweight neck protection solutions as well?\n\nIs everyone just very poorly geared or what is going on?

Isn't it possible to manufacture a pair of pants with some kind of lightweight kevlar or carbon fiber padding or something?\n\nI don't know much about what kind of material you would need to stop small pieces of flying shrapnel, but it sort of looks like that even something cheap and easy to work with like plastic or aluminum or glass fiber would do?",

            "**How likely are you to be taken prisoner (on either side) if you surrender?**\n\nI was watching a fairly old video of a guy defending a trench by himself against at least a handful of Russians. The footage seemed eerily like a video game, including a moment where a Russian soldier walks by, not looking at the trench at all, and only noticed by the Ukrainian soldier when he turns around. He promptly shoots him. I know I sound like a naive snowflake, but unfortunately that moment in the video was not censored, although his body just flopped down onto the ground un-spectacularly. After a brief moment the Ukrainian solider peppers more bullets into him to make sure he stays down.\n\nThis got me thinking how likely your enemy will accept your surrender in a tense and small scale close quarters combat? The Russian soldier in the video was likely heavily wounded and unable to provide much resistance. I don't blame the Ukrainian soldier for making sure he was dead however, as he was fighting an overwhelming force by himself.\n\nHad the Russian soldier thrown away his gun and called out for surrender, is there any chance he would be spared until the fighting stopped (assuming he'd survive without medical attention)? If the Ukrainian soldier would realize that his fight was futile and called out for surrender with raised arms, would he (and his spooked compatriot in the video) be guaranteed to make it out alive, or would the Russians be likely to kill them *just in case*?\n\n[Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2bXDQCyMNc&t=165s).",

            "There's almost nothing russia would do to provoke the United States to fly strike missions into eastern Russia besides a Russian attack on a nato member state or possibly deploying nuclear weapons against Ukraine.\u00a0 Russia weakening their border regions with nato is just an indication that they do not plan to initiate a hot war with the west.\u00a0 The west is already doing everything it can through escalation management to not end up in a war with Russia.\u00a0 Air defense in Siberia hardly matters today.\u00a0",

            "We don't.\n\nIf Russia is moving a single system, it's not necessarily an indication that they're totally out, just that they need more in the west.\n\nIf you need more air defence you're not going to move all the system from one area to another, you're going to take one from here, one from there ect, so you still have good coverage, just at a slightly reduced capability.",
            "They have the face of each driver, this is how well they can see this.",
            "> How soon until China stops looking to expand to Taiwan and sees opportunities to concur to the West? \n \nI don't think they really want to go west towards like Kyrgyzstan or Kazachstan. They have been trying to gain influence in all these countries to the west including Afghanistan. Likely in big part for natural resource reasons. But conquering seems like a big headache that they don't need if they can gain influence through other means. They have enough headaches in neighboring Xinjiang, would they really want more of that? North there is an area in Russia they want but I don't think it's worth risking nuclear war over it for them. \n \nAlso they cannot be blind to both Russia and the West failing efforts to capture Afghanistan. \n \nTo the east and South there is a whole bunch of things that they want a lot more.",
            "China's style is to finance massive infrastructure projects which they end up owning when loans are defaulted on.  They don't need to invade if they control the country by owning it's critical infrastructure.",

            "Are we, though? Or is it just Putin hoping we are?\n\nI mean, when we handed over tanks, we fully expected some of them to get blown up. And when it happened, we were completely un-shocked, but also happy that, for the most part, the tanks did their job in protecting their crew so they could live to fight another day. It certainly didn't demoralize the west or anything like that.\n\nI can't speak for everyone, obviously, but here in Denmark, no one I've talked to about it expects our F16s to be magically invulnerable once they get to Ukraine. Some will be lost, and while it's unfortunate (especially because the pilot is a lot less likely to survive than the crew of a tank), it is expected.",
            "The only susceptible people are the social media users, those are a minority and the support for Ukraine in the West is at all time high.",
            "My wife listens to her tankie father who gets all his info from YouTube and was utterly confused when I showed her the Trump video from a couple of months ago where he said he would even encourage Putin to attack NATO countries. The situation is super serious.",

            "Do you have a link please?",
            "Well, after 20 years of Western Europe treating their own defense as an optional line item in the budget, it took some shocking language on Trump's part to jolt them into taking things seriously. NATO is a military alliance, not a debating society. What good is a country's NATO membership if when Article 5 is invoked, their troops can't deploy and their jets are grounded?",
            "Nah, I think Biden will win and the Dems get small majorities in the House and Senate. \n\nVery few people have changed their minds between 2020 and 2024, but Trump\u2019s anti-abortion stance hurts him with swing voters and new voters age 18-22 who couldn\u2019t vote in 2020.",
            "Yea not looking too good. My family has already fled the US just incase. I hope Biden wins but it doesn't look great.",
            "Yeah. It is basically modern version of the nobility right now, with Putin's \"United Russia\" party being nobles.\n\nSo they all have power, but it is very hierarchical - just like nobility of the past, where nobles were given power and spheres to rule over by their liege.",
            "money is always power",

They already get it's resources super cheap and the Chinese population is estimated to decline massively this century and it's northern provinces are already depopulating at apocalyptic rates.",
            "This is the right comment. The so called west has already lost the Info war against russia, ignoring the obvious involvement of them in each of our society. When the russians are good at something, than this,  causing uncertainty and lack of trust. All the right wings, some openly and some from 3rd parties, were financed by russia. Aaand of course the lefties, are as always the unofficial speakers of russias positions and interest. Unfortunately we already have lost this war, we just don\u2019t understand the consequences in the upcoming years.",

            "Trump didn\u2019t do that. Did he say it? Aye, but that was in the interests of cutting costs. Also you don\u2019t persuade people by being rude to them. Honestly it\u2019s more likely it was a ploy by putin to increase tensions between the U.S. and Europe\u00a0",
            "What good is a country's NATO membership when they lose confidence in the US?\n\nNATO isn't a charity that the US runs out of the goodness of their hearts.",
            "Plus the larger share of old folk killed by covid were Rep ant-vaxers",
            "It looks fundamentally the same as it did in 2020. Due to works in the electoral college, there are three \u00a0states critical to the election, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina. Trump again needs to win all three, while Biden only needs to win any one.\n\nI'm not saying that's great for the world or anything - it's fucking terrifying. But there's a lot of evidence that the campaigns understand and see this problem the same way. Look at their spending to see it.\n\nThe next big event one way or the other will be this first debate on CNN next week. I think it will be the first time a lot of people will have to see the other candidate outside of their bubble, and that will realistically go much better for Biden than it will for Trump.",
            "Not even that. Nobles back then had warriors under their command, basically private (small) armies. Oligarchs in Russia don't.",
            "Oligarchs have economic power but not political power. Putin made sure from the start that they would not dabble in politics and as soon as one of them tries they are thrown in jail for some corruption charge or something that they know would never be a problem if they had played ball. They have money but not power.",
            "Yeah, if anyone can be credited with the increased European military budgets it is Putin. Any influence from Trump on that matter would solely be because of the risk of him pulling the US from NATO.",

            "Although wages are likely to play a role, bigger plus points will probably be logistical and labour motivation. \n\nTransport from a Ukrainian factory to the units can be completely taken over by the Ukrainian military and people are much more motivated to work long and focussed hours if the work protects the lives of family and friends.\n\nTransport of explosives at a large scale will probably require more paperwork and safety regulations inside of the EU too.",
            "Somewhat. The prices are about 4-5x higher than the were a little while ago with them now costing around $4000/5000 per shell coming from $1000-1500. Part of that cost could be the expansion of production introduced lately added to those costs but it is way more expensive now unfortunately, for whatever reason.",
            "Russia doesn't have more money than the West, but they do have more than Ukraine plus the West's aid budget to Ukraine",

            "Or you could just nationalise everything important they own in Ukraine. Either way, I disagree it would be simple. In fact, the whole process could end up corrupted so that some oligarks lose and others win.",
            "money doesn't grow on trees indeed, the money spent on ammo goes right back into our economies.\n\nhowever it's no excuse for massive cost inflation of ammunition. that is greed, and is worthy of critisism.\n\nperhaps even strong words...",

            "Ive seen numbers in articles as high as 8000 per shell, but that was probably peak prices",
            "High demand / static supply is the reason.",

            "Not in this case that the article is referring to. These shells are bought from other countries at an inflated price.",
