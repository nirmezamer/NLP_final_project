I've read  tests where they performed various impact tests under lab conditions on a slew of helmets, and actually some of the affordable ones did just as well or better than the expensive name brand ones. It's because they all meet the same stricter certifications, like the European ones. Spending beyond that, you pay for features and comfort, not more safety. Now, I'd still recommend an Arai or Shoei, the features and comfort are worth it. \n\nAlso, remember that different helmets (different brands/models) fit different head shapes, and you should get a helmet that fits your shape head comfortably.

Saiprasad (27), relative and neighbor Maya Anugra Vish (28) died at the Kanchikode Railway Station Road Water Tank Junction. The accident took place in front of FCRI at the well stop of the National Highway Service Road at ten pm on Saturday. Both of them were returning home after seeing their friend in Pudussery. Both of them fell from the overpass to the service road below after colliding with an unknown vehicle behind the bike. Kasaba police informed that since it rained, clarity regarding the accident needs to be provided and CCTV footage is being checked for this.",

            "Maybe a lineman can chime in, but I this has something to do with having too much load on the distribution side. \n\nThis is dangerous shit. Stuff like this is the reason my electrician apprenticeship was only three years and I said \"fuck this!\" We did commercial hot work all the time, and I watched a journeyman blow a hole in his hand with 277 by grabbing a bx he thought was dead. I watched another journeyman burn his face off in a 480 panel because he was adjusting wires, and one got caught on a threaded screw coming through the back of the panel.\n\nThe last straw for me was working in a drop ceiling, and a hot stranded wire fell out of a red wire nut and hit an ac duct, and copper splattered on my face and burned into my glasses. I peaced out after that.\n\nEDIT: Gee, thanks for the enlightening comments about working unsafe. Also, it shows you know nothing about the industry. There are plenty of reasons you can't just shut everything down. You can't just shut down the lighting in a 24hr plant to change out light fixtures. That's just one example, so get off your stupid soap box. I was simply discussing my experience and expressing how dangerous it can be.\n\nAnd to the Europeans that made it illegal, that's great, but this is in the US.",

What branch circuit was so important downstream and wasn't an induction load, which could trip, fail to run, or burn up on loss of a phase that it couldn't be turned off? \n\nThose switches should be fused to protect that transformer from this.  I see the adjacent one is not fused either.\n\nThat blowout at the transformer indicates a short circuit.  In my opinion, appears the transformer or how it was wired up caused this.  I lean toward issue in the transformer due to the extremely fast pressure failure of the can and the oil on fire.",

The worker was likely in 2cal long sleeve button up AF rated shirt or hoodie, leather gloves, safety glasses, cotton jeans or whatever pant, and leather work boots.  The 2 man setup you described is likely.  The catastrophic transformer failure would not have played into the ppe determination.  I hope they were light on their toes that day.  Due to the high incident energy on local distribution lines like this, lineman use distance as their best mitigation to arc flash.",
