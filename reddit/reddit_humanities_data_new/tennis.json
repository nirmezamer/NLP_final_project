It has the most boring tennis of the season by a good margin except for a couple of dives that players dare to as its softer to land on, but that's like 1 out of 200 points. \n\n\nIn some months people are going to complain about the grass Masters 1000 and having more weeks and once they get it and see Hurkacz, Eubanks, Opelka, Zverev and others servebotting their favourites in an upset they'll realize why Wimbledon plays slower.",

I imagine this is also because, you know, the great and amazing federer shanking balls and losing every now and again on the senior tour hurts his BRAND.  the mysticism and awe surrounding the \"great federer\".\n\niunno man just seems a bit shite to me, this guy is great, but it kind of mirrors some of my thoughts towards his greatest weakness which is his hubris and lack of humility when it comes to being able to just be shite and fart every once in a while.  he is very personable off the court but this weird mentality he has around his tennis and by that extension his actual game to preserve this \"invincibility\" actually hurt him I think many times.  He doesn't have to \"prove\" anything, he is truly the greatest there ever was, when it comes to what someone can actually do with a tennis ball on the court.  An unihibited federer (mentally)?  Never seen anyone play the game like that.  But the \"great federer\" mentality and BRAND?  It definitely hurt his *results*.\n\nWhenever he \"got in his head\" about the whole thing, his game suffered and the other 2 big three members were able to evolve and get better mentally imo.\n\nAnyway, a lot of rambling, but I just find the way he goes about this media docket tennis-adjacent stuff very weird when he publicly at the same time never picks up the racket to hit in any serious capacity anymore.  Case in point, around the same time he and djokovic went to some UCLA tennis for appearances.  Federer did a photo shoot and shook hands, Novak actually went and hit with someone.  And guess what?

            "Berlin is just a cursed tournament this year at this point. Hope Ons will be okay for Wimbledon, she's been playing pretty well up to now",
            "What the actual fuck is going on with this tournament",
            "What\u2019s wrong with this year\u2019s grass season? Aside from the usual slippage, this is insane \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Maybe Iga was wise for not participating in the tournament cause wtf",
            "The announcer mentioned during Sabalenka's match that she watched Sabalenka and Ons warming up before the match - didn't notice anything wrong with Sabalenka's shoulder.\nBut what did they do during that warmup?? Both had to retire from their matches.\n\nEdit - Coco looked GREAT. The forehand was firing, her serve was on, and her mental game was on point as usual. Ons saved 7 set points and Coco just stayed with it and got it done on the 8th.\n\nEdit2: The physios took Jabeur's vitals and it appeared that they advised her to quit based on her blood pressure reading.",
            "I was on stadium watching live and from 5-5 Ons looked very tired/dizzy :(",
            "Everyone's retiring what's going on? Last person standing wins Wimby?",
            "this feels like rome 2023. even in the final match, kalinina had to retire",
            "Oh no",
            "Wimbledon going to be something like Alexandrova v. Svitolina in the final, both of them beating Iga/Coco in their respective semis at this rate.",
            "Injury, sickness, what happened? Please add details to the post title, eg\n\nWTA 500 Berlin QF: Kalinskaya def. \\[2\\] Sabalenka 5-1 ***(ret, shoulder injury)***",
            "Coco has now won 3 in a row against Jabeur, each win coming from a different surface. Win at the WTA finals on hard, win at RG on clay, now a win at Berlin on grass, and improves her H2H to 6-2.",
            "Iga is going to win Wimbledon by default lol",
            "By wimbledon everyone is going to be injured. Except iga swiatek who herself has placed this curse upon the rest of her competition. This is how she wins (before anyone thinks I am serious\u2026 iga has been my favourite since 2020)",
            "All these injuries are getting out of hand.",
            "What is happening",
            "Is Brad Gilbert still coaching Coco?",
            "I\u2019ve been screaming from the rooftops Grass needs to be stigmatised and ultimately banned from the ATP tour. Look how many careers it\u2019s robbed Thiem, Rybakina, Potty, Vondrousova, Ons. It\u2019s criminal it\u2019s even a surface might aswell make them play on Olympic Ice",
            "they didnt want to be too exhausted for wimbledon",
            "Would you say her forehand is getting better?",
            "Whatever happen-ed happen-ed. Now we are here. We are in ~~Rome~~ Berlin",
            "Grass made Rybakina sick and gave Ons high blood pressure. What an asshole",
            "What happened to Thiem on grass?",
            "Let\u2019s ban grass because it is sometimes slippy. Great idea.",
            "Well yes. Thank you for helping my point. It\u2019s dangerous and has robbed us of Hall of fame careers. If a plane sometimes crashes because of an issue, you rectify the issue before another plane goes up. Same Logic applies. Going from the beautiful clay court season to this is bad for the sport"
