            "If you get it easily it's pretty likely. Even if you don't often get motion sickness (like me) it can still happen, but it might also depend on what game you're playing. I was fine with a lot of games, but 3D games where the camera view is moving around all the time would still trigger it for me. I got it pretty bad when I first tried playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the bus on my way home from work. \n\nThough it's possible (for some people at least) to build up an immunity. I tried playing a little bit of Zelda each day, stopping whenever I felt the first inklings of nausea coming on, and after a week or so I could play the whole way home (45 mins) without any issues. Might not work that well if you're not regularly a passenger on long rides though.",

I work on cargo ships and honestly if we're in a storm and rocking back and forth 30\u00b0+ each way for days at a time the best thing for me is to play a game.

Then you're on to configuring the controls and to be honest this took me the longest.
