And I am staunchly pro-choice, because denying women the moral agency to make their own choices is MORE horrific. Declaring dominion over women's bodies is MORE horrific. Thinking you're entitled to impose \"consequences\" on women for having sex is MORE horiffic. Putting people in prison for having/performing/aiding and abetting abortions is MORE horiffic. Forcing girls and women to carry pregnancies conceived through rape is MORE horiffic. Denying women life-saving abortions and miscarriage care is MORE horiffic. Imposing your religious beliefs on other people, to whom God gave free will to follow Him or not, is MORE horiffic. \n\nIf your vision of an \"ideal\" society requires any of the above, don't you DARE position yourself as a moral authority. And don't you DARE claim to have God or humanity at heart. Other people matter besides \"the unborn.\"",

I don't have the moral or religious quandary of whether I think it's a life yet, but it's not something that anyone involved will just shrug off or ever forget. Although I don't class a gestating pre-foetus as a life, it's undeniably potentially one, and that loss of potential will always be felt.\n\nI like to believe that anyone who has an abortion of a healthy pregnancy is avoiding the greater harm of allowing a life to form where it would not be wanted or could not be cared for. Ultimately, people who want children will probably end up having them but probably only two or three at most. Having one of those two or three at the wrong time would probably prevent another one being had later when they were ready to love it and care for it as every child deserves.\n\nHowever, as a man, I don't, and shouldn't, get to control any of that process.",

Weren't we already propogandized to believe we're life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and freedom?\n\nSo crazy to me that adults twice my age who have been \"patriotic\" citizens for decades longer than me, fail to grasp that at even minutely.\n\nRules for thee but not for me.",

Abortion is only legal for evangelists in a pro-life utopia.",

            "I was raised Catholic too (I\u2019m not currently practicing). I appreciate you sharing your Honesty here. While I do not agree that abortion is horrific (I don\u2019t believe that life begins at conception, and I don\u2019t believe that a bundle of cells incapable of living outside of the mother, is a person in any sense of the word), I can agree with you that removing another person\u2019s agency because of your own religious beliefs would be much more horrific than any belief that other person may hold. People are free to believe what they like, as are you, but those freedoms of belief should end where they impact another person\u2019s bodily or intellectual autonomy. Just because someone believes something to be true, doesn\u2019t mean you should be able yo impose those beliefs on others. What Christian\u2019s are trying to do with abortion is the literal equivalent of \u201cMuslims are trying to force us to live under sharia law\u201d. It\u2019s literally no different. People shouldn\u2019t be subjected to rules that are based entirely on the religious beliefs of another group of people. Anyway, I\u2019m glad your able to see the danger that this sort of thought poses.

As long as abortion isn't the first and only option, or regularly used as birth control, I do believe it is sometimes the least bad choice.

If it were more accepted and done right I believe abortion would happen less often.  \nI hope my point gets across how I meant.. it's 3am and I can't sleep.",

And as an outside observer to the USA\u2019s system of government/justice/executive branches, it\u2019s honestly baffling to observe the rank hypocrisy and sheer lust for power and control coming from the current batch of Republican \u201cconservatives\u201d. They publicly proclaim to want to keep \u201cBig Government\u201d out of the everyday businesses of the individual states and persons, claiming to be staunch constitutionalists. And yet they reach on down to the into the literal  depths of the most private of areas on a persons body, legislating and manipulating the courts to further their agenda, with Abortion, trans-rights and Gay rights etc. Claiming to be upholding the pro-life/pro-family values, yet greedily and glaringly obvious, at least to those of us observing from across the pond, they willingly and eagerly claim that protecting gun rights above the life\u2019s of so many people, so many kids, is enshrined in the untouchable 2nd Amendment! Or continuing to cling to fossil fuels, even if you don\u2019t accept the impact that has on global warming, the byproduct of the dependency on such fuels leads to poor air quality, increased cancer risks for those who live near refineries, or refusing to address the basics of clean water and sanitation, which literally is taking 10yrs or more off the poorer (often effecting more black and Hispanic) communities life spans who are unable to move else where. And yet they claim to be Pro-Life!?\n\n All the while undermining one of the very core principles established in the heart of the constitution, the separation of church and state. It\u2019s not even an amendment added on later, it\u2019s the part the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d wrote in it themselves. \n\nFinally, whilst the main discussion is on the right to have an abortion as the largest of the infringement with the undoing of Roe v Wade, it is seriously worth noting the other side effects that that decision impacts. Looking directly at how it would effect my own close family, my brother and his girlfriend fell pregnant and whilst they weren\u2019t exactly planning on the baby, they weren\u2019t looking to terminate either. But unfortunately, the pregnancy was an ectopic and dangerously so, it had seeded outside of her uterus and was attached to the large of the artery supplying the uterus. If the pregnancy was not terminated not only would the eventual progress of the foetus be unviable, but given the position of which it was attached it could have ended up causing catastrophic damage to her bowels/uterus/bladder/ovaries etc, and would have caused life threatening blood loss to girlfriend. In the various states that reverted to the Pre-Roe V Wade laws, now that life saving surgery to rectify it has become illegal, even though the foetus would never have been viable and the life threatening risk to the woman would become a reality. Secondly, my sister who has 2 kids and her husband would also be facing an illegal situation too. Her husband has had a vasectomy, so the issue of falling pregnant is no longer a risk. However she has had to use a slow release hormonal IUD form of contraception, this is because she has mild endometriosis which until the IUD solution was found to work, she had extremely heavy blood loss each and every month during her period, which in her 20s meant she was frequently anaemic and on 3 separate occasions she ended up in the ICU because the blood loss was so severe. She got the IUD eventually, which as a result of its function almost entirely prevents her from having periods in general, and drastically removes the monthly risk of bleeding out. But because her type of IUD can allow an egg to be fertilised, but doesn\u2019t allow the fertilised egg to seed into what would be the wombs lining, which is now totally illegal in I think 16 different states, even though they have a vasectomy and the ONLY use of the IUD is to prevent her cycle from nearly killing her each month. \n\nThose are just 2 personal family examples of why the draconian law changes would have effect my family if we lived in the states. And yet they proclaim to be pro-life. Not to mention the fact that there are millions of women who rely on various medications to control their cycles, or other folks having their medications stopped or changed for a lesser medicine, simply because the laws prevent them as the meds are technically the same as a chemical abortion, but they are used to prevent a ton of various conditions from pain control to rheumatoid and autoimmune conditions, people who are disabled and having a hard enough time getting by day by day are now being told the drugs they\u2019ve relied upon for years is no longer legal. They are legal to men still of course, so men don\u2019t have their lives turned upside down, but the women do, women who already face significantly different treatment by the medical profession, than the average man does. They are frequently brushed off and believed to be \u201coverly dramatic\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201cthe pain you\u2019re facing isn\u2019t as bad as you say it is\u201d etc etc etc! And if you\u2019re a black woman, that poor treatment is automatically doubled!\n\nWhilst men who have a child like understanding of both biology AND a basic \u201cSunday School\u201d grasp of the bible, are now Foisting their belief systems onto others without the foggiest clue as to how it is now effecting vast swathes women. It\u2019s sickening to watch and learn about. But it seems to be taking a back seat compared to the main focus on the right specially to have and abortion. \n\n(I know this is a long comment, and I thank you for sticking it out until the very end!)",
            ">However, as a man, I don't, and *shouldn't*, get to control any of that process.\n\nI'm in the same boat. I'm not the one who has to, in the worst-case scenario, carry the fetus to term, so why should I dictate what the one who *does* can or cannot do?\n\nHell, if the roles were reversed, and men gave birth, you can bet your bottom dollar that not only would the SCOTUS predominantly, or even *unanimously*, agree that abortion is a right, it would have been codified *decades* ago.\n\nRepealing Roe v Wade was never about choice. It's about control, through and through.\n\nA nation that claims itself to be free does not actively strip away the rights of half its population.",
            "You do get to control involvement in a child's life as a guy though. So if i accidentally got a woman pregnant but didn't want children yet but she wanted to keep the child, i could opt of raising the kid. \n\nConversely if I want a child but the woman does not, i cannot ask her as a man to birth the child so i can have one because it's not me giving birth even if i dont need her to help raise it. \n\nYou as a man are equally entitled as a woman to not want a child but we as men cant have any control over the physical bodily autonomy of the woman who is pregnant. \n\nI thought id clarify that.",
            "I totally get your point but it's probably good to set as a reminder that abortions are not always about ending life though.\n\nAn abortion, simply put, is removing or expulsing an embryo or fetus. It is not, *necessarily* ending it, while it sometimes does - not always.  Many pregnancies or health related abortions occur without a living entity.\n\nSometimes the life is essentially dead before a formal abortion even happens, by which a lot of these laws are still restricting abortion access for.  It's important to remember because the restrictions imposed here are not only about unintended pregnancies.",

My personal perspective from a disabled woman's standpoint on this is purely from the abortion viewpoint although I'm almost positive that several of my meds would be taken away from me (pain and anti anxiety in particular) if I were in a state that had gone back to the pre Roe v Wade laws...I'm lucky to live in a fairly liberal state that, even with the hoards of \"conservatives\" upstate, won't be removing a woman's choice...however...I suffer from severe back problems that cause severe chronic pain...if I was to get pregnant, my health problems would get abundantly worse...my pain would drastically increase and I would be forced on bedrest almost immediately. Assuming that I could make it through the pregnancy, how would my health problems and inability to even stand for more than 5 or so minutes affect the child...taking away the affects on my body for a moment and focusing solely on the quality of life of the child, I can barely take care of myself both financially and physically...the life of the child would be drastically effected by my lack of funds as well as my inability to function. I don't think that that is fair to a child. I'm very aware that people choose to have children without financial stability, but I can't personally imagine bringing a child into the world that I wasn't sure I could properly care for and provide the best life possible.\n\nBecause of Roe V Wade being repealed, I'm now having to take a much closer look at having my tubes tied...the birth control that I've been on for about 8 years allows me to not have a period which helps me not suffer increased pain and removes the stress of bleeding from my life...I haven't wanted to get my tubes tied because that means that I'll have to deal with having my period again and I won't have a choice in the matter again...the other potential option of having a hysterectomy would throw me into early menopause which would also increase my health issues...even living in a state that has vowed not to remove my freedom to choose, I am feeling forced to make a choice that I never wanted to for reasons beyond removing my ability to get pregnant.

Abortion access is critical to the health of birthing persons. They literally save people's lives every day. Beyond that, each and every person has a right to decide when or if they are ready to carry a child. Any reason for ending a pregnancy is valid, and if someone wants to celebrate not taking on the burden of a pregnancy or raising a child, I think that's perfectly reasonable. But I guess that makes me crazy.",

She never go to do things like that and was trapped in her life. \n\nI\u2019d suggest the husband take her on a big trip out do the country to experience other places and people and cultures. She wants to feel special. Give her some special to talk about and remember.",

            "What an awesome response",
            "Could also be on good terms and he had a dark sense of humor and would have found such a joke funny. Also to me her expression honestly looks like she\u2019s more sad than anything",

            "Do you know if she is his widower or if they had broken up before his death? I think it would be the latter.",
            "Its a matter of self-respect, not a matter of respecting that person.\n\nNot being rude is a choice you make for yourself, not for others.\n\nFor example: I have people in my life I really don't like\n\nThat doesn't mean I will go out of my way to be rude to them because I choose to be better than that and those assholes have nothing to do with that decision because its not about them.",
            "You just shouldn't play with certain energies, and this is THE one they talk about. You just shouldn't speak on the dead like that, it creates bad juju.",

            "See my previous comment. Amazingly you\u2019re not the only person who both uses Reddit and also has a life outside their home. Some people find corpses disturbing and it\u2019s *not down to you to decide they shouldn\u2019t*. End of story.",

            "I was leaning towards this. I have a pretty dark sense of humor and I surround myself with like minded people.\n\nMy old man died in 2016 and my brother and I threw a rager instead of a funeral, while he was still around. Unknowingly both my brother and I told him at different times something akin to \"if you're gonna die can you wait until tomorrow? We put a ton of work into this and it would suck for the guest of honor to flake on his own party.\n\nHe lasted 3 months after. It was an awesome party. My old man was a HS teacher for 40 years and well liked. Some of his old students came from across the country to pay their respects. Everyone had at least one story to tell about my old man that marked them for life in some way.",
            "Also seems weird that she'd be invited to his funeral if they weren't on good terms",
            "I\u2019m on good terms with my exes and would find this hilarious.",
            "If I got along with my ex and they did this to me, I\u2019d find it funny towards me too. But I\u2019m pretty sure my family wouldn\u2019t. Especially if it was posted on social media. I somehow found that is what is going on though. \n\nHe could have been abusive as hell and she only went to know she was safe and it\u2019s still screwed towards his family. And let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s who the funerals are for.",
            "God bless I guess lol, that is incomprehensible to me.\n\nedit: I'm sorry, do the people downvoting really agree that there exist more than a handful of people who would want anyone, their ex or not, to smile over their corpse and take a picture like this?",
            "Yeah I don\u2019t think you call your dead husband your ex? That seems wrong",
            "Most people who have spouses pass during their relationship don't refer to them as ex's, they refer to them as their late (insert title) or deceased (insert title). Since they never actually broke up, one person just died, most people don't find it appropriate to call the other person their ex.",

            "I am. Thank you!",
            "Dude should see the road kill on my street. It\u2019s far more disturbing than this man who looks like he\u2019s asleep. If you can\u2019t handle an image this tame then just don\u2019t use the internet, and you should probably never go outside or watch the news either.",
            "I can fix that",
            "Not your mate, pal!",
            "Plot twist: I\u2019m the Chola in the picture.",
            "Kinda figured it was",
            "I have zero idea why you\u2019re getting downvoted. Dark humor or not, on good terms or not, that\u2019s a dead person. Why is she smiling?!",
            "Same here, but there are signs that you can look at to get a better idea.\n\nHonestly, figuring out exactly how old younger people are is like spotting AI. Sure, it looks smooth and all, but I see that extra finger.",
            "Kudos to you, you're the best!",
            "You\u2019re not getting it are you? Well done, you\u2019re not disturbed by this image. Neither am I. But other people have every right to be disturbed by whatever they feel is disturbing. \n\nMaybe you should go outside more if you feel so strongly about a random anonymous person\u2019s reaction to a picture of a corpse.",
            "Not your pal, Scoob!",
            "Not your mate, partner",
            "This has truly been a wild ride",
            "My brain has never learned to properly identify/remember faces.. leads to awkward situations.\nBut thank you for your nice comment \nRegardless of age or even the circumstances..  this is pretty trashy behavior imo, especially posting it online.",
            "Hahaha, still the same boat! I often tell people I have partial face blindness because, fuck me, it's basically true.\n\nI can work with someone for 4 years, but if I see you at the store, there's no guarantee that I'll recognize you, lol.\n\nAnyway, I do agree that the original post is trashy unless the dead person was a sex offender or worse. \n\nWhich is the kind of info I was trying to find out in the first place!"
