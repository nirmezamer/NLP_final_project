Obviously that's a LOT more work, to create a memorable bridge, but my gut tells me I want to hear a change up of some kind before that final chorus. Perhaps not a massive amount of extra work to repeat the music of the last verse with some kind of musical solo? Know any good acoustic guitarists who could add a tasteful lick?

            "Production is tasteful. The synth voicings you've chosen are great. I would agree it's too repetitive, but this is the risk with instrumental music. If you don't have a lead line and you aren't telling a story with a voice and melody, you have to work twice as hard to take the listener on a journey.

            "I enjoyed this one a lot - put a few of your tracks into my driving playlist :)",
            "I too have added this to several driving playlists now. \n\nNice work, fan gained!",
            "Cool intro with the synth and vocals, very smooth. The instruments are all fitting well. The drums entering are real fitting, and perhaps the beat could be a bit more complex at points. Overall it sounds good IMO :)",
            "I'd love an instrumental version, the vocals ruin the ambience of the song and turn it into a pop-esque piece.\n\nOtherwise you did a great job! Very professional recording! Especially the vocals!",
            "I love the vibes but imo the drums could have come in earlier and a light hihat or smth would have also benefited them imo. The instrumental is great tho, I love it",

            "The playing is done really well, I think the tone is a bit too muddy and gain-y if that makes sense, it could be a bit less overdriven and the tone knob could go up by a teeeny bit. Apart from that though I think it works through and through, the playing is well done.",

            "Would you have an alternative to spotify for me to listen to? Thanks.",
            "This felt almost like a soundtrack song to me, with the atmospheric qualities and all. But that\u2019s not a ding it was still an enjoyable listening experience especially with headphones. The sound selection was cohesive and that low end bass isnt super loud but it\u2019s there, lurking. Nice work!",
            "It's got a big dungeon synth vibe to it at the beginning.\n\n  \nI think the mix is really sharp and too in your face, the snares and kick especially are quite harsh and my ears kinda have to turn down their sensitivity to accomodate that but then I miss out on other parts of the instrumental. The drum beat itself is a cool rythmn, although that snare fill does get a bit overused (every single fill it's a bit much) it is a cool fill\n\nThe synth note bit around 0:55 is really good.\n\nThen you got the spooky part around 1:10 which is where the dungeon synth first impression came from I think.\n\n  \nOverall I do see potential in this as a kinda horrorcore Clipping type track.",
            "Great now I have the image of Jason Vorhees rapping in my mind...\n\nGreat beat, energetic, in your face and fun! \n\nIt's not my type of genre but I appreciate the execution!",
            "Kinda sounds like you played with the Pan a little bit too much, atleast imo and the sadly the build up has no dynamics and kick build up would need a chang up imo, especially when you use it so often, but other than thats its good",
            "I forced myself thru this by turning my headphones down, the drums are clipped super loud and distorting, but from what I could hear of the instruments, there are some pretty cool buzzing bass and synths that should be in the foreground of the mix. You can even see it in the waveform that the sounds at the beginning are almost half as quiet as when the drum slams into the clipper. Turn the drums down in the mix so you get everything sitting around negative 3db and and use a multiband compressor to bring the overall track volume up to no more than 0db. If you want intentionally distorted drums for horror theme, I dig bit reduction distortion for a light static sizzle that adds depth. The song idea has potential, but needs to be mixed and mastered.\n\nOn a side note, the loudness wars of the mid 2ks ended, music sounds far cleaner when it's dynamically mixed lower and you may need to turn headphone UP to hear things, not DOWN because it's too loud. A quieter mix will still hold focus for the listener to decide to listen harder and turn it up, but if the track comes in too hot, the first reaction is to hit mute/stop/skip and if you're lucky, they'll just turn it down to not damage their ears/speakers. I'm mega guilty of over clipping music from 20 years ago, and now trying to locate the original masters to redo them, but that overdrive for powernoise/gabber kinda worked at the time, but it's 2024 and there are way better plugins for mastering than slamming it into a Brickwall limiter.\n\nTotally dig the horrorcore theme, I'm aliens \ud83d\udc7d",
            "I find it well mixed actually, each instrument is in a clear position in the mix.\n\nThe composition itself is awesome! it has a nice buildup to it. What exactly would you want to change here?\n\nMaybe I'm overlooking something? It sounds good to me...\n\nThe epic ending is awesome I love the second part of this composition!",
            "Interesting melodies and use of instruments in this one! I wouldn\u2019t worry about genre clash, I think mixing genres is how we push music forward. I like it!",
            "This is the best thing I've heard here today. I love it, the vibes are stellar. Really nice job. If I were to critique one thing about the composition it's at 2:10, I get a little lost in what you're trying to do here. Whatever melody is going on clashes a little bit with what you've built up to. Don't take that too critically because I think what you've got going on here is really cool and unique.",
            "Totally down for the vibes here, really chill. As a matter of taste I would recommend cleaning up the lows just a little bit, but it also could totally be the texture you\u2019re going for too. I echo the other comment on not understanding the direction of 2:10 on as much, but I don\u2019t think it keeps this from being really great!",
            "Nice work I think this is all good. I don't think I would change anything\n\nLooking for feedback on this https://youtu.be/5tNnqV3vh3c?si=Urt_zlQBrV34C9E6",
            "this is really cool, i really like the atmosphere. i think the bass sounded good, a nice rumble throughout. sound design and direction overall was really nice.",
            "This is top tier shoegaze right here. Sometimes less is more and I think this is a perfect example of that. The heavy reverb feedback on your tone is really awesome and your voice is complimentary to the vibes.\n\nI don't know if it needs a solo to be honest. One thing that did come to mind is, idk if you've ever listened to Wand but their Golem album has this crushingly deep dirty heaviness and I was just imagining this moment where that huge tone would just come in swinging hard. Not actually necessary but I just really want another band like early Wand to come along lol. Anyways, hope you actually develop this into an album, I'd buy it.",
            "That song is much different than your other songs on soundcloud. I'm curious about the difference. Blue Heart vs On My Mind is way different.",
            "Cool sound that gives a kinda Rey Pila vibe. Not sure if the lyrics will age that well though lol.",
            "nice song, i like the upbeat playful vibe of it. really nice sound design. i like the lyrics, i think they fit the playfulness of the song. i think the vocals could be a little more forward/ clear, especially during the chorus. the vocals sound nice, they just sometimes get buried under the instrumental.",
            "My first thought was that I'd be interested to hear a version of this song where the vocals are more forward in the mix. Really liked the guitar solo parts! Also think the chorus could be a proper ear worm, I just feel like it was sonically quite similar to the verses so it was a bit hard for me to identify it as the chorus as first.",
            "This was well written, really like the lyrics, the instrumentation was well done but overpowers the vocals a bit, personally would like the vocals brought up just a bit and the cymbal/ride brought down a bit (just bright in the mix so stands out) it was melancholy and a good track for sure.",
            "i like how honest and raw the lyrics are, guitar is great, i like and the arrangement. the vocals are overly filtered for my taste and a little pitchy, i think they could be more up front in the mix - melody could perhaps do with a little variation.",
            "First of all, a bit off-topic but I like your visuals on Soundcloud, the song cover art at first feels like an unusual choice for the track but I somehow really dig it :D also enjoyed the track itself and all the little beat variations",
            "I like it, good use of percussion. Only thing I would say is the pad sound thats playing the chord sounds a bit rigid.\n\nI'm looking for feedback on this https://youtu.be/5tNnqV3vh3c?si=Urt_zlQBrV34C9E6",
            "I'm digging the percussion layers, nice beat bro. I think something you could add is a layer of small noise, or rain ambience to create that vintage sound heard in some Dilla tracks to help fit the vibe!",
            "I dig what you're doing here. A couple things: was the drop in audio across the board on purpose at :38 in? That came off a bit odd. I can't tell if the ambience effect on the vocal is because of the vehicle's natural sound, or if you've added additional reverb. I think a reverb with less mid-range and more upper mids might help increase the clarity of the voice. I also recently discovered a game-changer plugin: Trackspacer the ducks whatever tracks you set it on, and can be triggered by any other track. So in my case, I use it a lot on the master bus, triggered on the vocals, to get the entire mix to duck ever so slightly when the voice comes in. You can definitely overdo it, but I've found on several vocal projects that I was having a hard time with, it boost the clarity without boosting volume if you use it subtly. Cool track!",
            "Just checked it out I love the mellow synths you have going and the really chill chords. The mic sounds clean as well only thing in my opinion is I feel some elements needs to be a bit lower in the mix but not bad at all great job.",
            "Admittedly, I don't know much about darksynth tracks but I dig the aesthetic that you are going for here. The one thing i'm thinking is that maybe that lead synth is a bit to harsh on the highs and maybe you could use a shelf eq to tame that? Again, maybe that's just the characteristic of darksynth, but i don't know",
            "This is good. Strictly speaking, I would drop the main melodic, slightly detuned voicing down a bit more in the mix. I don't think anyone is going to miss the main gist of the track, but with a bit higher volume, it's a bit grating in the upper frequencies. Maybe just running it through an amp plugin, or making it a bit dirtier with some additional effects would cut the harshness a bit more as well. But this is a great start!",
            "i like it! It sounds like the sound of a Gotham chase!",
            "Pretty cool! I like the vibe. I'm inclined to want more emphasis on \"sly and fine\" - it comes and goes throughout the lyric lines, but as the main idea and song titled, it feels like you are almost trying to de-emphasize it. They say \"leave them craving more\" but in this case, I would say I'm wanting a second verse while I'm listening. It feels like it ends a bit abruptly.\n\nNice work though. This is a great vibe!",
            "The production is pretty great on this. Lots of ear candy. I'm not sure I'm buying the rap, but this could be my own biases and preferences mostly. The voice seems fairly raw compared to the other elements. Perhaps consider dropping your voice down a bit more throughout the piece or using some other effects to increase the interest. Those moments when you do that already are some of the more interesting. I would also say that you clearly have musical acumen listening to the backing vocal pads. Consider writing a pop melody and maintaining a lot of the rhythm of the current vocal, but sing something instead. Again, that's feedback based mostly on my own preference, so take with a grain of salt.\n\nNice work!",

Guess we're conditioned to expect vocals taking priority, but felt like the mix but the bass further forward, although the harmonies etc make it sound like the vocals are intended to grab attention (rather than just being textural). The drum transition worked for me!",

I like the way you flowed on the beat and I like that you embraced your style as it came to you in this song. My only tips are to work on your production going forward and also your rapping but both of that will drastically improve as you make more and more music. Good luck bro!",
            "Hm, honestly I think this is really good. I personally don't see any issues with both bass and key. The only thing that I can think of atm is that you could maybe start differently with the bass. The part you have between 24 and 28 seconds might work better as an introduction and then you can become a little more playful along the way. So basically you could try switching your current bass introduction with that part and see if that works. \n\nYou could also maybe try adding a mellow instrument in the back that plays some sustained notes so that you have something that grounds the listener and they can fall back to when they feel like they are getting lost in the arrangement. \n\nThat's all I can think of right now, but again, I really like this! You are correct that especially your drums are on point. :D",
            "Honestly, love it! Do you have a soundcloud so i can like and repost?",
            "I'd say I love the happy with a touch of melancholy atmosphere you've created!\n\nThe instrumentation and mixing are great! Maybe the drums could be more... pronounced?\n\nOtherwise great beat!",
            "Hm, I like it, but I kept waiting for a bit harder beat to drop (especially around 1.20). You know, like a bit of a trap beat. For some reason i expected it. It could benefit from mixing it up a bit more perhaps.\n\nOther than that, sounds good, keep it up!",
            "This sounds like the uplifiting song on the album, like the one where the rapper goes on about how their mother worked really hard to put food on the table and shit like that and how things can juuuust about work out alright if you play your cards right. \n\nI disagree with the note about a harder beat dropping at 1:20, I think the way that works is good, I do think it could switch up a bit more before doing the crescendo-y type thing you do at 1:45ish. I also felt like the main synth resolving on that slight uptick major note got old after a while, I'd like if on the fourth bar of a measure the synth ended on a downtick instead of an uptick.",
            "I think a lot of the other comments pointed it out thoroughly but I think it just needs different or more drums. The tops are there for rhythm but they don't hit so it sounds like a long bridge at some points. For what it is it's well put together, but getting sub/808 and kicks and such to really hit when things come back in would tie it up nicely.",
            "Good vibes, but I think it needs to pop off at some point, like it seems like it\u2019s building to something that never comes",
            "Idk.  I think you need to incorporate more theory into this and use better sounds.  Right now, it sounds very amateur.  Maybe use some modulation and accents.  Everything is kinda flat with no dynamics.",
            "This is a beutiful track man. I'm picky with my rnb and I don't just compliment an rnb song like this for any reason but this is a great sound you're developing and this is something that can get you a lot of attention. Also the mixing on this and production is superb. Keep doing your thing man, you got talent!",
            "Love this! So this may just be a matter of taste, but I feel like lowering the vocals *slightly* so it doesn\u2019t dominate the orchestrals is a good idea. I feel like the vocals should be ornamented by the strings, not on top of them. It may also just be a matter of putting a little more reverb on the vocals to give them more space to sit in.",
            "I really enjoyed that, well done! Some minor feedback points from my side, though some of that could be subjective:  \nThe additional synth coming it at 0:44 didn't fully fit for me, it felt a bit harsh and competing with the general flow. Other than that, I think your sound choices suit the genre very well! The break that starts around the 1-minute-mark went on surprisingly long for me, for example as a listener I was already anticiparting the drop or at least something slightly new happening at 1:22. I think it's fine for it to be longer but then needs a bit more subtle variety to keep my attention. Also, the outro part at 3:07 could have a slightly more interesting transition.\n\nBut again, please keep in mind that the overall track works well, these are just the things I would personally probably take another look at if it was my song and arrangement!",
            "Would you perhaps have an alternative to spotify for me to listen to?",
            "The main part that comes in at 1:06 is the best part.  Really catchy. The rest of the composition is not quite as engaging, though the harmony in the intro is somewhat interesting. The keyboard sounds are well made and the mix is clear. The guitar is a nice touch, as is the background noise.\n\nWhen the drums kick in at around 0:45, the crashes sound rather unnatural. I would remove some of them, since I don't think they are really needed, or rethink the crash sound.\n\n  \nNice work overall!

Once thing you could consider without having to change anything radically would be some drum breaks and maybe play around with filters here and there, to change the vibe in certain sections.

There may be some rhythmic issues contributing to this as well, but it seems like we need something to glue the rhythm section together a bit better. Boosts at 60 and 200 I agree could help a bit with the drums being a bit anemic as well, but may not do enough to glue it all together.",

            "I dig it! One thing you may want to consider: if you cut some mid-range out of the signal being sent to your vocal reverb bus, the lyrics might be slightly more intelligible, but it depends on your end goals. That's the main thing I noticed that was distracting. The whistling may also contribute to a bit of a bunch-up in the upper-range of the voice. Maybe look to cut some 3-5k in the whistle. That may take too much presence out of it, so you may need to experiment.",
            "Nice man! This may be more of a preference thing, but I'd drop the snare down in the mix a bit - it's a bit disruptive to the overall vibe, in my opinion.\n\nI'd also check the harsher upper frequencies in the vocal - the 3k - 5k range could use some dynamic EQ ducking, in my opinion, to take care of the spikes.

This actually has a dope groove to it and is pretty chill almost summer house kinda vibe. \n\nPlease take my next feedback with the purest of intentions to really wanting your music to sound the best it can.......For so long I struggled with too much low end in my productions until I started playing night clubs and realized that I had WAY too much sub bass. It takes so much less than you think (most of the bass that you hear and even feel happens from 80hz-1.2khz), not saying put less bass because I love bass, but there's a way to do it without eating up headroom that squashes loudness and clarity. Longer compression, split sub and mid bass and turning the sub bass down, cutting the low out of everything besides the kick at 80 hz (which I am sure you already know and can hear your kick/bass sidechaining). I put the track though my source emulation and even on Air Pods the bass is very prominent.   \n  \nIf I didn't truly care, I would have stopped with the easy two sentence comment, but this literally took me years to realize after relentless mentors telling me. For me, I thought the way I was doing it was the only way to get the sound profile",

            "This is cool! Mix-wise, in my opinion, the high pass filter may have been a bit too aggressive. The voices all sound a little anemic. I wouldn't adjust it too much, but just a bit more low-end in the 200-400hz range on the voices I think would hit right.\n\nThe hat loop is also just slightly crispier than I would prefer. Maybe consider cutting a bit of 3khz-5khz out of that part. Otherwise I think this is a pretty great production.",

Very few instrumentals do it for me; particularly synth/loop instrumentals, mostly because there is such a glut of them out in the wild. Much easier to produce than the next level, with a vocal, lyrics, emotional performance, etc. But it's a great start! Your instinct seems to agree with me - a vocal would be a great layer here.",

            "I think it sounds good actually! The sense of not really \"grabbing\" the listener might come from the fact that it sounds like you're in your comfortable range a lot. Breaking out into a higher register for even just a few notes here and there (especially for a 3rd or 4th line of a verse) can add some spice and a change of pace in my opinion. You're kind of already doing this but could probably push it a little further.",
            "> Abandoned - Sam Brenner\n\nlove this artwork!! super lush guitar and drum sound. vocal is super smooth!! love the guitars that come in at :32. the vocal reminds me a ton of Green Day here. production is excellent!! also reminds me a lot of blink-182's vocals. \"same notes on different wavelengths\" is a great line!! love the falsetto backing vocals at 2:07! this is super solid and full!! Great track, enjoyed listening!\n\nLooking for feedback on this track if you have time! https://open.spotify.com/track/6WOsbtId0IKq3px6SdXm3Q?si=d5dcdff9d47440ad",
            "I dont know if you use Ableton but you can highlight the notes that are in the scale in piano roll to make things easier. Id say you should probably work on making your tracks less repetitive before you start learning how to mix better. I'd say the bass fits really well with the other elements but the main pad thing that plays those chords over and over and over is veryyyy repetitive. \n\n\n\nId say add some kind of melody on top of that like a mono synth that plays something new so then have something to latch onto.  I like the synth that comes in layer but i would definitley lowpass it using either Auto Filter or EQ. All in all, id say just keep doing what youre doing and youll keep learning from experience. The drums and bass are mixed quite well actually. I think that crash cymbal sounds a bit weird but everything else hits nicely.",
            "wow this video is awesome!! really love the groove at the intro. Vocal is amazing!! reminds me a ton of City & Colour. this is super smooth. love that guitar break at :39, this is insanely good!! vocal melody is amazing at :50. this also reminds me a lot of Boys Like Girls, major 2000s alternative rock feel to it. the voice reminds me so much of Dallas Green from Alexisonfire and City & Colour!! love the \"everythings brand-new\" hook at 2:11. so good!!! Cool track, enjoyed listening!\n\nLooking for feedback on this track if you have time! https://youtu.be/j-bfM1Y2ceY",
            "I like it - great job! The first 2 minutes has just enough variation/progression to keep me hooked while also feeling relaxing/mellow. To me i might be missing a leading element or melody in the section from 2 minutes in an onward to keep me hooked the same way the vocals does in the first section, or the lead at 3:38. The transition is to each is section  is nice though",
            "Not too random! Cool stuff! The vocals really brought me in. Nice. The synth element at \\~2:20 is gorgeous. Really nice development there. I think something that would work well to intensify the music towards the end would be to increase the intensity of the bass in that progression. 6-5-4. It does grow, bc the whole ensemble grows, but I think to grow the bass more relative to the rest of the ensemble could be effective. Pretty nice already though!",
            "i think the best way of making it jump is to work in the low harmonics. in trap and hip hop,  the two genres im most familiar with, the best way of making a theme like this to \"drop\" is using a riser and some 808s (on the most basic level). i dont necesarily think this might work here, since many of the instruments aim for a more \"acoustic\" sound, but maybe some cello samples would do the work with enough equalization and compression",
            "the theme in general sounds pretty good. maybe is not for me, because there is some things about the guitar EQ that dont give it \"enough body\" (maybe a bit of compression on the middles?) but overall a good theme. also, on the instrumental bridge, i think the guitar would benefit of a bit of sidechain over the rest of the instruments. same for the bass and kick\n\nbesides that, an amazing track",
            "the idea is good. and i like the dissonances that you put in here. however, i think the song would benefit of some more low pass filters and phasers if you want to archieve a more \"lo-fi\" sound. specially for the drums. \n\nthat being said, love the 808s. if we are embracing the mix of genres, i think i'd benefit of some glissandos, pretty much what is done in uk drill music.. also, is the leifmotiv you used the beggining of a jehovah's witness song? because the theme sounds pretty close. \n\noverall, a good theme and fun to listen, kudos.",
            "Not too well-versed in trap but I could really see this as a more cloudrap type of beat, I'm not sure if that's what you're going for but I like what you've done with it-- the mix is solid, and I love the way the chords swell into eachother. From my limited understanding, maybe integrating more attention-grabbing drums/bass would give it more of a trap feel?",
            "> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebq1Us5oExY\n\nlove that intro. really cool video, like the performance shots in lofi. driving shots are cool!! this reminds me a lot of Smash Mouth! and Barenaked Ladies! \"lack of circumcision imma give a little tip, sometimes i dont mean it but i tend to be a dick\" that is an insanely good lyric!!! catchy chorus!! like the \"sing with me nananana\"! super cool track and great vibe. Cool track, enjoyed listening!\n\nLooking for feedback on this track if you have time! https://youtu.be/j-bfM1Y2ceY",
            "Like the vibes, really upbeat which is refreshing. Got a soft spot for the mass crowd, went to Umass Amherst which is when I started getting into the music. Real down to earth stuff, love it homie. \n\nI will say for video editing in the future, pay attention in your headphones to the stereo field and send that left hanging intro to mono, distracted me a bit in the beginning from the good stuff!",
            "Cool track! As far as genre goes - I think you could say it's in the ballpark of electronic/house, and then leave it open-ended from there. That'll at least give people a general idea.\n\nCritique - It's quite soft. Had to really turn up my volume. Also, the beat - or maybe just the whole track - I think could really benefit from more aggressive compression/limiting. This will help with volume and also give it a fuller, bigger sound. I honestly don't know a whole lot about producing beat-music like this, but yeah - I think that's the main issue. It's lacking **oomph**. \n\nReally nice musically though!",
            "This is such a fun dancey track! Great vocals, great energy, love the variations in the beat. My main critique would be putting the vocals higher in the mix in the beginning, but for most later points in the song (after each drop) they're mixed nicely so it might be an intentional thing. Great work, keep creating n experimenting! Music is a playground",
            "I REALLY like those vocals, where'd you source the samples?? They are super clean in the high end, I want more of them! Would have loved to hear them glitch out over the drop sections. \n\nIt sounds a bit more like lounge music honestly hard to pin down a genre, which is a good thing to define a sound.",
            "Hey, this is pretty cool! Tough to make recommendations since you're working over a backing track essentially, but I think your vocals could be a biiiit louder. Like, not much, but a tiny boost might give a better mix. They are currently just a tad buried to my ear. \n\nIt's a cool track though - Def release it!",
            "> https://youtu.be/HaXqsGaNJHI\n\ncool visualizer! like the snare sound, awesome bass tone at :10!! love the beat drop at :20!! super slick and clean sound. that bass is insane!! this reminds me a lot of LAKEY INSPIRED. has a wintry feel to it, love that drum fill at :59! like how the key changed at 5:00. this is a cool concept!! sounds really good across the keys. wow!! Cool track, enjoyed listening!\n\nLooking for feedback on this track if you have time! https://youtu.be/j-bfM1Y2ceY",
            "I think the main beat is good, though the vocals could be a bit louder. I would suggest a couple of structural changes: Make the intro shorter (i.g. Introduce the kick and snare at the same time) and introduce a bridge (a different section) before the last part to help the song feel more full and better paced.\n\nNice work!",
            "sounds really professional and well done! one thing imo that could change would be the chorus transition, it doesn't 'hit' as well as it could.",
            "Love the vocal harmonies!",
            "I actually like the beat...I think you could do alot more with the background and synth to play around with the rise and fall of the track. Good work though!",
            "General vibe is pretty chill, I'd definitely say it's a dance/house/thing, but I'm not exactly up on my genres, I just like what I like\n\nI do like this too",
            "i really like the vibes and the subtle keys in the background. if i were you, i'd maybe look into vocal mixing techniques - it kind of stands out from the rest of the mix imo. the cover of the track is also really good.",
            "Hey bro I just listened to your track and I like your style. You got a nice flow that can get much better as you make more music and as the production gets better your music will sound even crazier than it already sounds. Good work on this track and keep putting in that work!",
            "All I hear is a finished product. Can you demo the before/after or the actual ways you can sculpt the sound?",
            "Has anyone ever told you that you sound like the big fake head guy Frank from the movie Frank? This is a compliment, I love that movie lol",
            "Did I just stumble upon a masterpiece? Yes I did!\n\nYour voice is amazing and has character, reminds me of 70's singers.\n\nThe song has a nice rhythm to it, the pacing is perfect and the sounds are clean.\n\nI love that the track has an uncertainty to it, you don't know how to feel, there are energetic and melancholic parts throughout!\n\nThis song is a hit waiting to happen, Is there a way to follow the band?\n\nAlso MANTA SHRIMPS is a cool name, it reminds me of the sea!",
            "I really don't like the lead vocalists tone.  The instrumentation is dope.  I feel like it could have been mixed better.  Maybe, thicken the drums through eq.  It sounds like something.  I don't think it is Coachella good, but you definitely have potential.",
            "Needs more sheep!\ud83d\ude09 (I like this vibe, good work!)",
            "I like your voice! Reminds me of some vocalists in the 70s/80s, though it could use some more developing. Overall the song structure is nice, the mix could use work but the song has a nice vibe like you said. I like the guitar work in this song and I think a better mix and maybe with more guitar layering it would really bring that to the attention of the listener. Nice work\n\nMy latest track for any feedback! https://on.soundcloud.com/HFDhZVXcgzk1cr4C7",
            "I love the strings, this is great. Not my usual genre but I enjoyed this song a lot! Production is solid too from how it sounds on my laptop speakers",
            "Nice sounds going around there. Only thing i would recommend is some mixing techniques. The snare is a bit too aggressive and the main distorted synth is a bit too distorted and could maybe use some reverb to widen it a bit. When the pluck thing drops though, it sounds really cool. But i think there isnt really a clear melody to latch onto and theres a lot of randomness going on with the pattern. Sound selection on point though",
            "Cool start with the \"weird\" sounds, it sounds interesting! It starts sounding like an old video game soundtrack around 0:50, like a mashup of Terraria and Mario. IMO the song lacks development and feels a bit empty. It could have moved into a more energetic beat after a minute or so, or changed to a different direction by adding more instruments.",
            "Hiya! I am hearing a friendly tribe of robot colonists exploring a new solar system for them to colonize. I do like me some weirdness. Cheers.",
            "Man, that's something else all right! It's not really my cup of tea, but it did trigger something and kept me listening and interested. I'm curious about your process of creating this though, how did you approach this?",
            "i like the vibe and you definetly reached what u was going for but in my opinion it gets repetetive really quickly and as the other comment suggested as well, some developement with adding or removing instruments for different parts and maybe adding some drums would make it more enternaining",
            "I don't think it got repetitive too quickly,\n\nThis really reminded me of like a more intense version of stuff off Mother Earth's Plantasia. The quiet bit at around 1:35 was my favourite easily, it had the perfect blend of tension and serenity. And the way it continues is amazing. Personally I think it's a great track, I do think the click-y synth maybe gets a bit too much use throughout and it could be varied up a bit.",
            "Honestly, just keep diving further into the experimental synth and get as weird as you can. I love finding new ways to use sound and experimental stuff is such a good source of inspo",
            "It definitely sounds like you are just beginning.  It is pretty bare and a snooze to listen to.  Keep working.",
            "Do you have a song you would like feedback on? The link takes me onto your artist page.",
            "Yeah this is literally against the sub rules.",

            "Thank you very much. I checked the list for you. Mind you these are all software synths in Reason 12. I used 4 instances of eXpanse hyperwave synthesizer from Blamsoft. 4 instances of Europa (Basses)(Reason exclusive) 1 instance of Xpand2 from AIR music technology. 2 instances of Objekt (Reason exclusive) 1 instance of BBC Symphony Orchestra from Spitfire Audio. 2 instances of AlterEgo.

            "thanks for feedback :)",
            "Thank you! Yeah I actually love that lead synth myself. Definitely saving for future use. I had to do a bunch of tweaking to get the blend to sound clear and pronounced but still play well with a full orchestra.",
            "Thank you!",
            "first off all, thanks so much for the encouraging words :) and I gotta say, I can totally see how a bridge could further elevate the song, so this definitely got me thinking. If I do write one I will make sure to ask you for follow up feedback if you don't mind :D",
            "Oh I'm glad you say that, because personally I have been a bit frustrated because ithe mix still sounds a bit muddy to me on my jbl flip :D but I guess that's also perfectionism rearing its head, so your comment made me feel a bit more at ease, thanks!",
            "Ooooh I love that description! I've struggled a bit to think of similar songs / artists / pop sub genres, but I can totally see why you would draw that comparison, I do really enjoy vibey kpop so that could totally be a subconscious influence :D",
            "thanks so much for taking the time to give me feedback a second time, that's so cool :) and feels really good knowing I was able to actually improve the song!",
            "Thank you! And yeah i think i will try to vary the main melody in future tracks and possibly also use different sounds for more variation  \nWould love to hear something you are or have been working on :)",
            "Thank you! I can\u2019t describe how happy i am to have my production being described as tasteful! \nYeah good point i think i might try to use more vocals and experiment with even more with the composition of the tracks i make. I recently learner of the \u201ctwo loop rule\u201d which i might want to enforce for myself \nAnd yeah she really did! We really had a moment when she listened to it. And the next couple of days she said \u201ccant believe you made a track for me\u201d, which was amazing especially since she is not typically into this sort of music :)",
            "Thanks very much!",
            "Thanks for listening, and good suggestions! Who was your uni professor?\n\nI usually put a little video clip on my stuff, but just didn't get to it for this one. Haha. But yeah, that would be nice.",
            "Thanks for listening :) I assume you're talking about the really sudden and loud piano note? It was kind of an accident, but honestly it is a good idea to have that peppered in a few times throughout. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe stuff happening around 12:30 was really nice. I agree. I think I really felt the direction in that moment and went pretty crazy on the bass part. Some attack could be nice.\n\nThanks for your thoughts!",
            "Thanks so much for listening! Glad you like the bass part. I do too!",

            "Thanks man, that means a lot to me!",
            "I have a bad habit of over indulging in buildup and it results in a less engaging track. One thing I was hung up on a lot was the lead synth when the heavy guitar comes in. I don't want it to sound too shrill and I like reverb to soften those issues up but then sometimes it recesses the leads too much. Ive gone through many changes and can't trust my own ears anymore, fresh ears are nice. I appreciate your thoughts, thank you very much!",
            "That bit at 2:10 is pretty much just noise. I think it needed something there but you're right that that's maybe not the right thing. Thanks for your feedback!",
            "What do you mean about cleaning up the lows? There is a bit of distortion on the guitar. I'm using SubLabXL but that's almost a sine wave which seems like the cleanest tone. Is it too predominant in the mix?\n\nAnd you are right about the stuff at 2:10 sometimes I throw in placeholder noise to differentiate an area and I forgot to define it.",
            "The vocals sound great, but i think  some of the elements in the beat are not in key,  or it's just that the sound selection doesn't blend well with the verses. Thanks for your feedback",
            "Thank you for the feedback and thank you so much for the compliments!! \n\nThe more I listen, the more I agree that it doesn\u2019t need a solo. I actually haven\u2019t heard of Wand before but I\u2019ll be listening to them all week for some inspiration now lol. \n\nI actually am working on an album right now! I\u2019ve been dialing in my sound and trying to write as much as possible as well as practice the instruments that aren\u2019t my forte (like drums and bass guitar). I have some tracks and ideas that are much heavier than this one. \n\nThanks again, I\u2019m glad you like the track!",
            "Hahah I know, I can see that giving some whiplash. If you sort by most recent you\u2019ll see a much slower build to this point. But ultimately I was gifted a midi keyboard a few years ago and started making deep house. I had \u201cmild\u201d success and was playlisted and then started making music for the wrong reasons. \n\nIn turn, I lost motivation, realized I didn\u2019t want to tell other people\u2019s stories anymore and dove into making music that is more true to me. There are a lot of middle ground tracks that aren\u2019t on SoundCloud too",
            "Thanks, I do prefer vocals to be deeper into the mix  but I probably have to work on making it, and all the other parts, stand out a bit and less mushed together.",
            "Thanks so much! Appreciate the honest feedback!",
            "Thanks for the feedback! I will probably redo the vocals soon, I am a long haul truck driver and recorded them on a headset mic in the cab of my truck on a break! Not the best studio or mic!",
            "Much appreciated thank you!",
            "Much appreciated thanks. \n\nNice work yourself, the acapella fits the beat well in terms of style and vibe. Matches up pretty well. Nice work",
            "I feel ya, thanks for listening!",
            "Thank you for giving it a listen and the detailed feedback. Very solid advice. I had stuck a reverb generator on there for the first time and had no clue what I was doing lol. I\u2019m going to use trackspacer on the next project thanks to your suggestion. And the drop in audio is on purpose to remove an artifact. Definitely odd way of doing that but the song in itself is extraterrestrial so anything goes lol!",
            "Thanks a lot! Yeah I know that lead is a bit harsh, but I kinda like it. Maybe it's because I spent too much time with it. Definitely will try to highcut and it can free some space to make arps sound more readable or some",

With everything you've mentioned (explosion, epic, different, dystopian, distortion), it sounds like you've experienced it exactly the way I wanted it to be experienced! \n\n**Comments on your song:**   \nListened to it twice, great song! A really confident blend of styles. There are some surprises in section changes, like the more pop-punk verse leading into a big tom fill, then suddenly dropping down lighter for the chorus - but it's done so deliberately, it works well! Bold vocal, VERY memorable hook - think this'll be stuck in my head! Excellent production, and plenty of well-placed bits of one-off ear candy! This earned a spot in my playlist!",
            "thanks! hope i can make more music like this one day soon!",

            "I usually use splice to find samples but for this one I actually made them myself, but the lyrics are inspired from an old r&b track I found on the same scale  I used for my notes, but I can't use it for copyright reasons so I took only some parts and recorded them added a ton of reverb and EQ also I changed the pitch.\n\nThank you for your feedback. What do you mean by making them glitch out ? (Cuz I made some vocal chops in the second drop)\n\nFor the genre it's weird yeah I have to take a reference track in a specific genre and improve the drops and arrangements to fit it. Because like this, it's hard to get signed on record labels. It needs to fit something.\nThanks again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a",

            "Thank you so much! I appreciate the feedback!",
            "Thank you so much!",
            "Thanks for the suggestion!",
            "thank you! i've always struggled with vocal mixing lmao but this is very useful",
            "appreciate it",
            "It is easier for me to transform a little wav file that you could send me so that you have a real feedback on its effects.",
            "Tbh I looked the film up and I really don't see it looool",
            "Cheers aye, glad you liked it! Will def use this as the main single now LOL\n\nGotta finish this debut album, but there's a few EPs/Mixtapes uploaded on Bandcamp: [https://westbeesmotherhood.bandcamp.com/](https://westbeesmotherhood.bandcamp.com/)",
            "Yeah I'm still a shit vocalist, I've only recently gotten into singing. But it's gonna take some time, I'll probably go back and re-do the vocals at the end of recording the full album. Will defo thicken the drums that's a good idea.",
            "Cheers aye!",
            "Im being so honest, thank you so much for the feedback. I love getting solid thoughts on my stuff and this means a lot. I'm glad you enjoyed the song. I know I still gotta keep going but small stuff like this means a lot to me!",
            "I see what you mean! Maybe drums would fit better? I wanted to replace them with the trippy sound.\n\nI experimented with the synth (deepmind 12) here and I got lost a bit, haha...",
            "That's a wonderful imagination!\n\nGlad you enjoyed it!",
            "Thank you for enjoying my admittedly weird and experimental piece.\n\nAs for how I make the tracks, I am very \"spontaneous\". I found a lead sound, wrote a melody, then found a bass sound, wrote the bassline and the trippy effect was me messing with a preset and hitting the arpeggiator.\n\nUnfortunately there is no deeper thinking going on, just me playing with my new synth and experimenting!",
            "Yeah I can see the flaws of this piece. Admittedly I've constructed superior compositions. However I still enjoy the trippyness of it.",
            "Thanks for the kind words! Yeah, I've listened to Plantasia a lot (my fav Mort Garson album) so I cannot deny the influence.\n\nI liked the clicky synth too much and I wanted it to replace a possible drum pattern so it persists throughout the track. It's worth mentioning that I have an \"one and done\" method where I create sounds and don't save them, forcing myself to find new ones every time.\n\nSo even if I wanted to change the track I can't :)",
            "Thank you for the inspiring words \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
            "Sorry to hear that you didn't like this one...\n\nKeep in mind not every song needs to be \"in your face\" energetic though...",
            "Thanks for the info!!!!",
            "thanks!",
            "Happy to help - good luck!",
            "I just posted one in this thread, actually!",
            "Yep. Ill be having a listen.",
            "Alright! A sweet gentle sound experience with lots of good samples and sounds. Very laid back. A few things. It felt just a tad too short. I was expecting a light change in beat to give it just tad more roll later in the track maybe. That bucket sound could have faded in and out volume wise just a bit more imo. Mind you these are all subjective personal opinions. Overall a highly enjoyable sonic romp. Thanks for sharing.",
            "It's funny how that can work. The same thing happened to me but with visual art so I switched to music. A little bit of success can backfire. Personally, I like the last track better than the earlier ones but given your history forget I said that.",
            "Yeah - I think the vocal was getting buried a little at times, sounds like the vocal is competing with the bass rather than the vocal being undercompressed. So to start I'd try putting the vocal up a little, maybe just 1dB or so! If that's too blunt, maybe use volume automation for the moments where the vocal falls underneath, or use a multiband compressor to sidechain the mids of the bass so that they duck *slightly* during the vocal (not enough to be noticeable, just to make a little space). \n\nBut otherwise I think it's a great mix and great song - I could just imagine it sounding even better!",
            "thanks!!",
            "Yes, far too compressed - I'd recommend spending more time thinking about whether it sounds dynamic enough and how the transients sound, rather than whether it's hitting a specific loudness or LUFS value! Dan Worrall's longform youtube videos are an excellent resource to learn about loudness. If you compress too much, the transients get squashed and don't have any impact",
            "I only mix on Senn's the HD650's and run both SoundIDReference and Realphones emulation and check most if not all sources frequently during mix and composition. Cant recommend this combo enough. I do have a lil mono mix cube and recently just got a nice BassBoss system so I don't have to run to the club, but both of these are usually only to check masters with real speakers. Both the emulation software and my RME interface can toggle mono and simulate different club environments. \n\nIt's a simple fix just force yourself to mix the sub as low as possibly tolerable to your taste, then another db down I found worked for me haha",
            "Well, I like more 90s style electronic music as opposed to most modern styles. I also enjoy soundtrack and heavy metal.",
            "thanks!!",
            "awesome!!!",
            "hahaha!!",
            "Oh I seeee. Gosh they really wanted you to be specific. It's so tough sometimes.",
            "thanks!! Yes it is!!",
            "Is it still code?\n\nThen what you can do instead is to upload several raw, unaffected WAV files, and the resulting affected WAV files. Maybe note what parameters you have changed upload that as audio.\n\nThe before and after is important, because how it affects the original sound will help determine if people want to use your program or not. \n\nIt will also help us give you feedback, because it is possible that another plugin is already doing the same thing.",
            "It's not a problem tbh that clicky synth it works for this song, but I think going forward ease up on it a bit. That method probably really helps for getting tracks out I noticed you're on a bit of a prolific streak! Keep it up man!",
            "OK, heading there for a listen",
            "Thanks, that's good feedback, appreciated!",
            "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s strange how quickly it can shift your focus. Hahah I appreciate that, but I\u2019ll try to forget it. I\u2019m gonna check out some of your tracks here shortly",
            "Thank you!",
            "Can you share a song or two for context?",
            "Fucking love your song, straight bop! You\u2019ve got a very Mark Hopper-esque voice, also a bit of MGK (I know he\u2019s  a bit divisive in the punk rock community but tone wise you\u2019re similar). I\u2019ll give you a follow on Spotify! Did you get your song professionally mixed and mastered or was this DIY?",
            "Is there a place in reddit to exchange small wav files? To prove effectiveness I would prefer to start from files that are submitted to me rather than sounds that I know to be effective ...",
            "thanks, though I'm taking things slow for now release and production wise...",
            "Do you mean a song I like or a song I made?",
            "Vocaroo allows you to upload audio for free and share them as a link. SoundCloud does as well.\n\nI don\u2019t think sounds sent to you would be any more effective than the ones you already have. \n\nWhat most people look for is simply cause and effect. Just use several different original WAVs with the same effect. Use one WAV and apply different parameters to it. Use a sine wave and transform that.\n\nFor now, understand this: only you have control over your program and only you can use it for now. You can show us what you can do to our audio, but we don\u2019t know what we can do to our audio.\n\nThe goodness of the result is irrelevant for now, but the potential of the program is very relevant. If you want to make a plugin with this, you need it to have the potential that many users can utilize. How well it works can depend on many more factors than just your program and its parameters.",
            "Thanks to you, I will do that."
