I want to use this opportunity to try out new healthy habits long enough to see their benefit and take them home. \n\nI\u2019m a tall, inflexible guy with average or a bit below cardio fitness, little fat and little muscle. (193cm/80kg).\n\nI would like to ask your help (tips/warnings/sources) for a healthy and balanced beginner routine (7 days a week). I am thinking about yoga for flexibility & meditation, and using the hotel gym (mostly freeweights and cardio equipment) and the pool (available last 4 weeks) for muscle gain and cardio. I\u2019m also planning to focus on eating right/more, while remaining vegetarian. \n\nI will work 6-7 days per week 12hrs per day, so I am aiming to use most of my spare time, which will be only 30-60 min, (like, 2100-2130) for these activities. \n\nWhat kind of balance/schedule would you recommend? Any tips/tricks/sources?\nAgain, I\u2019m hoping to find, build, enjoy and take home new healthy habits.

            "Hi guys, looking for some nutrition advice on getting through a fat loss plateau at 6\u20196\u201d / 245lbs\n\nContext: I used to cycle and play regular football. During Covid I took a bad tackle and fully ruptured my ACL, tore meniscus etc. It was a 2 year wait for surgery (initial misdiagnosis, Covid related delays etc etc) and during that time I gained a lot of weight. \n\nI never enjoyed the gym, but once I got my referral for the knee operation I got a PT for prehab. It\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. The prehab quickly got merged with strength training, and two years on I love the gym\u2026\n\nI\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made, I\u2019ve put some stats below for the weight loss which is largely from the start of this year. Most of this has come from calorie counting, daily weigh ins, good routine with gym and reducing alcohol intake. I\u2019ve gained muscle too, and people around me are making comments which is amazing.\n\nWhat I\u2019m hoping for is some nutritional advice, hints or recommendations. I\u2019ve got two stubborn areas of fat around my chest and torso. I\u2019ve managed to reduce them to a point but I\u2019ve plateaued recently and need to find a way to break through\u2026 \n\nIm a groomsman for a friends wedding early October (15 weeks from now). It\u2019s two weeks in a hot country so I really want to get as lean as possible for pool days, suit, photos etc. also really curious to see some gains.\n\nIve posted some stats below, because of my height (6\u20196\u201d) I\u2019m struggling to hit the protein stats I\u2019ve seen recommended by the likes of Jeff Nippard and Dr Rhonda Patrick whilst keeping calories under my BMR\u2026\n\nAnnoyingly I\u2019ve partially torn my meniscus again which rules out some cardio, but I can swim, bike and use a ski erg with no discomfort.\n\nAge 28\nHeight 198/ 6\u20196\u201d\nPre injury weight 105kg / 231lbs\nPost op weight (September 2023) 126kg / 278lbs\nCurrently around 111kg / 245lbs \n\nFrom measuring yesterday:\n18.9% body fat \nBMR 2185",
            "Sounds like a great opportunity! Good on you for aiming to use this time to gain some good habits. \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for exactly how to structure things, but here are some general tips:\n\n- Don\u2019t go too hard all at once - exercise intensity, too high of weights, etc. \n\n- Rest days are good. I alternate lifting and cardio for 6 days and then take 1 complete rest day. You need some recovery. Some people do \u201cactive\u201d recovery, like going for a leisurely walk or gentle yoga. \n\n- View the gym as a playground for the first few sessions - try out different things and find what you like! You won\u2019t enjoy everything, and that\u2019s okay. You can read about \u201cmust do\u201d exercises all day long, but the only beneficial exercises are the ones you\u2019ll actually do. Make consistency your goal. \n\n- Once you find what you like, make a plan of sorts so you know what you\u2019ll do each day when you go to work out. You can write it out beforehand and reference it as needed. You don\u2019t want to waste time wandering around wondering what you should do that day. \n\n- Glad to hear you\u2019re taking nutrition into account too. Make sure you\u2019re eating enough to fuel your work. If you find you feel sluggish after increasing exercise, you may need to bump up your intake a bit. Calories are not bad. \n\n- Along with food, try to get enough sleep too. Food, exercise, and sleep are the big three things to balance. Don\u2019t run yourself into the ground with work and exercise if it means not sleeping. Your body recovers and performs better with sleep. \n\n- Drink enough water\n\nI could think of a million more things, but that\u2019s what came to mind first. And I\u2019m not an expert, but I\u2019m happy to try to answer any specific questions about what I\u2019ve written. Best of luck!",
            "I\u2019m not a physiotherapist, but I would think actively tensing (engaging) those muscles would cause undue strain and negatively affect your gait. I would think general strengthening would be more helpful. \n\nMaybe make sure there isn\u2019t something else going on, like hip drop (which is a sign of weak glute medius and minimus).",
            "Could try taking longer strides I feel like that loosens up my hip flexors and even slightly stretches the quads a bit more than regular steps.",
            "Are there inclines where you live or is it all flat? I've felt it's way easier to isolate how you use leg muscles on inclines and declines.",
            "There is no way to get a percentile for this.  \nIf you want to improve your cardio, do more cardio. If it\u2019s for a specific sport, practice that sport more and find workouts intended for that sport.",

Ehhhh not so much.\u00a0\n\nI'd say just follow your program as others have suggested, but don't beat yourself up if you end up not being able to complete reps/sets. Your focus should be on maintaining the muscle you have while you cut, not on new PRs. Good luck!!",

            "Depends on my programming at that time. The nice thing about 3 and 4 day splits is that it's easier to move things a bit to accommodate a missed day. Otherwise, I just consider the day a loss and continue the rest of the week as if it didn't happen. If it just happens once in a while it won't have any noticeable effect on your progress and isn't worth stressing about.",
            "You told us your entire life story and left out the one thing that might help you. How much you\u2019re currently eating. How much protein are you trying to eat? Are you losing weight? Have you calculated your tdee instead of BMR?",

Where you lose fat is dependent on genetics. If you're still in a deficit and also gaining strength and muscle, then just keep doing that. \n\n> I've managed to reduce them to a point but I\u2019ve plateaued recently and need to find a way to break through\u2026\n\nAside from following a proper program, tracking calories/weight, and getting enough rest, there aren't really any other game changing secrets to making significantly better progress.",
            "It's boring but the truth is the you literally just need to eat less. \n\nIf you have issues reaching protein goal and keeping calories low, you need to eat more protein-dense foods.\n\nLow fat cuts of meat or low fat dairy. Whey in smoothies, cottage in whatever recipe",
            "Thanks for your tips!! Especially the \u201cthe only beneficial workouts are the ones you do\u201d struck with me, and aligns perfectly with my goal of finding a nice balanced habit. \n\nJust a quick question: I once saw online that deep stretching for prolonged periods puts your muscles under the same strain as a workout of that muscle. To your knowledge: is this something to take into account, and thus not do some more intense yoga/stretching of the same muscles I exercised the day before?",
            "Good point! My gym has 1 squat rack (a crime I know) so makes it much more important imo",
            "Thank you! Tbh, I'm not following any programs to start with, I'm just doing my research and creating a DIY meal plan with my target calories in a day.",

            "I\u2019m doing a program but might have went a bit off it today haha (it was rpe based for this stuff). I just wanted to get that 135lbs on incline close grip. Never put that much weight on that bar before so it felt like an achievement.",
            "Yeah, it\u2019s normally a once in awhile thing - it\u2019s def not smth I feel good about. But it\u2019s the second one I\u2019ve taken this week (I normally workout 6 days a week, assuming I take today off I\u2019ll have done four.) so I feel a bit iffy about just fully skipping it, yk?\n\nHistorically I haven\u2019t had many problems with gym attendance, but I did a bit of a reset and made a new routine a week or two ago so I\u2019m still kinda bajigitty about days off n whatnot.\n\nAlso thanks for the input, i appreciate it",
            "Whatever keeps you going is best, but imo it's easier to stick to simple \"minimums\" and be flexible with the rest.\n\nFox example you focus on reaching protein goal, some fat, and then whatever fits in your max calories goal.\n\nIf you prefer having a stricter plan to follow that's fine, just know that if you don't,  it's okay to keep it simple.\n\nAs for programs, I'd pick one from the wiki and stick with it for a bit for good progress",
            "I'm still not sure what you are asking. I just do the same routine I was doing before, though I may decrease intensity on some sets and I don't try to push my progress as hard.",
            "It's mind over matter. Like I said, if it's just a fluke then it won't really impact your body in reality, but if its going to bug you mentally despite that then I would just go.",

If your friend always does sets of 3 and increases the weight he's likely going for strength, volume will be lower (unless he's doing 20 sets lol) but probably in the future his 1 rep max will be higher than yours, so if you both spot each other and try to see who is able to bench the highest weight he will likely win 'cause he's more used to lifting heavy",

            "Nice, so in addition I was training bad because I don't want a super chest (I almost need bras), but I want strenght. Thank you buddy. Any tips? How many times a week do you go to the gym?",
            "I started 3 months ago and main goal is weight loss since I'm fat lol I go 4x a week, monday and thursday upper body, tuesday and friday lower. I don't really want a big chest either ahah but if you need to lose weight it can look a bit \"bulky\" at first simply because there's fat, it will go away. If there is one thing I've understood is that you cannot become big by mistake all of a sudden, you must go trough your sweet spot first. It's like when you drive, you can't go from 0 to 200kph without passing trough 100, it's impossible. My chest at least already looks like a chest and not like breasts lol\n\nFor tips idk man, for the first two months I trained without a plan ahah. Then I studied a bit, and since I don't really want that much hypertrophy and my goal is to do calisthenics when I lose these 10kg, I looked into strength training and I found the programs from [stronger by science](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/program-bundle/). I think they're the best bang for the buck because they're science based and for only 10\u20ac you basically get years of training programs. There are two programs for beginners, one for strength and one for hypertrophy, I chose the first one. I'm liking it, it's fun and it looks like it's working. Basically you chose 4 main lifts and once a week you do heavy weights for each of them. Like 5 sets of 3 at 87.5% of your max weight. At the end of the last set you have to note how many more reps you think you could have done if you didn't stop, and based of that number your max weight increases. So the excel automatically gives you your next weight each week based on your performance. Then each lift has accessory exercises which you train normally (like 3x8) at 75% of the max (always, because it is linear. So the weight can increase every week and you always do the same reps, the advanced programs have different variations instead because at some point you can't increase so quickly anymore). For the bench, for example, in 3 weeks I got to 65kg 5x3, and the last set I did 5 reps instead of 3. So next monday it's giving me 67.5kg. And so on",
            "If you want to get stronger, find a good strength program. I follow GZCLP my self right now as a novice lifter. You know it is for strength when they make you lift between 1-5 reps per set."

I was wondering, for stuff like the barbell row and romanian deadlift, should I try using straps if I can\u2019t feel the weight working the muscles it\u2019s supposed to be? My form might be wrong, but also I\u2019m only using like the barbell with 5\u2019s or 10\u2019s on each side. It feels like I\u2019m too tired/can\u2019t hold onto the bar itself to do enough reps that fatigue my muscles or even practice the hip hinge movement. Same with the deadlift, even though you drop the weight to the ground for each rep, I feel like my arms/back are too tired to start the initial pull after a few reps. I can do the bar with lighter weights though and the movement feels easier to do than with just dumbbells. Any advice?",

            "Hello! I recently decided that I wanted to get better at dips and pullups, so I added some variations of these into my routine alongside my other non bodyweight exercises like bench press, pulldowms, rows etc and I run a Upper/Lower split. Now my question is, since I can only do a total of 1 dip, 0 pullups and 2 chinups, would it be even worth it to try to get stronger on these if I am currently bulking? The main way I'm currently doing these, is starting a set trying to do as many real reps, then following that up with 3-4 sec negatives. I do those until the lowering portion gets too fast. And about weight gain, I gain about 1 to 2 kg a month, and have been bulking now for 6 months, but I've been hitting the gym for a year now. I'm currently 82kg and 180cm tall. So what do you guys think? Is it worth it, or should I just stick to non bodyweight stuff for now?",

I start workouts with two hard sets of cable lateral raises (one regular set and one drop set), do the rest of my workout, and one hour plus later my side delts feel recovered enough that I'm able to hit the same two hard sets at almost the same performance level.\n\nMy question is: is this a bad idea for any reason? Asking because almost every program I know puts all the sets of the same exercise back-to-back (with the exception of supersets), and I've never seen any program put an exercise at the start and at the end.",

I started lifting weight mid last year and due to health issues had to stop in December. I finally got back into weight lifting back in April. I did the full body workout program from the wiki page for beginners. I been working out 4 days a week with that routine and been recovering very well. I am towards the end of my first week of doing a P/P/L split 6 days a week. For progression my idea was once I was able to hit the top end of a rep range for all sets I would up the weight 5 lbs for upper body and 10 lbs for lower body. I take a 3 minute rest between each set currently. Also I can\u2019t really do body weight movements such as pull-up/chin ups, push ups, or dips. I just do not have the upper body strength currently for these exercises. I cannot afford the gym, I do have a budget friendly home gym. I have a rack, barbell, adjustable bench, and adjustable dumbbells though they only currently go up to 50 lbs. The routine: Push A: barbell bench press 3x8-10, dumbbell shoulder press 3x10-12, and dumbbell skull crusher 3x12-15. Pull A: bent over row barbell 3x8-10, dumbbell row 3x10-12, dumbbell bicep curl 3x12-15. Legs A, barbell squat 4x8-10, RDL 4x10-12, single leg dumbbell calf raises 3x12-15. Push B: overhead press 3x8-10, incline dumbbell bench press 3x10-12, dumbbell tricep extensions 3x12-15. Pull A: barbell upright row 3x8-10, incline chest supported row 3x10-12, barbell bicep curl 3x12-15. Legs B sumo deadlift3x8-10, Bulgarian split squats 3x10-12, single leg calf raises 3x12-15.

That way the day 2 exercises won't always suffer from immediately following after day 1. \n\nAnother tweak could be to go a bit easier on Sat than Sun each week, regardless of whether you're doing day 1 or day 2 on Sat that week. I don't mean change weight and reps, but rather maybe leave a few reps in the tank each set on Sat and then only push sets all the way to failure on Sun.",

Maybe after the practice you got last week, your form is coming back and better form almost always means harder. \n\nUltimately though, as much as progressive overload is absolutely a best practice, it's less critical when you're just dipping back in after so long. Remember that you've basically re-started your noob gains phase. The gains will come from even a very sub-optimal routine at first. Don't get too hung up on the number on the weight or the number of reps, just put in an honest effort and get to within a few reps of failure and you will progress.",

In comparison, picking something up off the ground is a very natural movement and people naturally brace for that. And bench press  is close enough to a pushup, that people often  can do it fairly well.",
            "In addition to what others have said here, \"beginner\" is a *suuuuuuper* vague term when it comes to lifting weights. There are basically 2 main factors to how advanced a lifter is: how much muscle you've built, how much you've refined your skill in the lift. The first is a super-slow process at best, the second is incredibly difficult to quantify.\n\nYou end up with some people saying \"beginner is your first few months where you're just learning how to do the lifts\", some people saying \"beginner is how long you can run a Linear Progression before hitting a wall\", some people saying \"it's [6, 9, 12, 18] months (some longer period than group 1 says)\", some say \"it's until you can lift [X]% of your body weight on [Y] lift\".\n\nIt's just a weird thing to try to draw boundaries around, so not really that useful to use as a metric for progress. It's good to have milestones to aim for, but ultimately if you're stronger than the person you were a couple weeks ago, you're doing awesome.\n\n(And yeah, some people are just good at squats. I progressed *really* fast with squats at first, while it took me a longer time to get the hang of the other lifts. Even DL was weird for me for a while, even though now it feels easier for me than squats at the same weight do.)",

            "I'm not sure what your reference is, but 171lbs for a beginner may be reasonable assuming that a range for beginners included folks who have been squatting for several weeks or even months. There's not of guys who have never lifted before that could put up that number.",

Made my legs feel weird and made my head feel weird (even if the weight technically wasn't even that high).  Could barely approach parallel. Eventually got used to parallel. Tried to do ass to grass and felt like my legs were dying. Got used to that too after a few sessions. Now it is still hard but otherwise feels fine to do, similar to bench press.\n\n=\n\nAs a sidenote I felt extra weird about it because I had been doing leg press for many months and felt squat should thereby be fine and yet it absolutely was not fine for me hahaha.",

            "There are always tradeoffs. \n\nA slower bulk's tradeoff is that you put on less overall lean mass, but you also put on less fat mass. That is to say, if you put on about 4lbs over 8 weeks, you may put on something like 3lbs of lean mass, and only 1lb of fat mass. \n\nA faster bulk's tradeoff is that you put on more overall lean mass, but you put on slightly more fat mass. That is to say, if you put on 8lbs over 8 weeks instead, you might put on something like 5lbs of lean mass, and 3lbs of fat mass.\n\nHere's the thing though. Losing fat is actually pretty easy compared to putting on muscle. On a deficit, you can easily lose nothing but fat mass. In 8 weeks, you can easily drop 8lbs of fat.

I've had some injuries that still act up, it takes a lot of effort, and I seem to get really bad DOMS in my legs no matter what I do. I found it really hard to not skip leg days and it was messing with my overall momentum. As a result, I've gradually moved towards a split that spreads leg exercises out through the week rather than having a dedicated day just for them and I've never been more consistent. As a result, I'm progressing better than before as well \u2014 not because my new split is science magic, but because it helps me stick to good habits. \n\nOther than that, the only thing I'd recommend is thinking about how fatigue progresses over time.

The numbers provided by my smartwatch is never accurate in terms of calories burned.\n\nI have a garmin forerunner 255, which is a pretty nice pretty high end fitness tracker.

I just aim for rep PRs. \n\nMy current workout has me working up to an easy top set of 2-4 reps, around 2-3 reps in reserve, then drop down and do a lot of rep work.

It's not going to be a quick process\u2014you should probably aim to only lose about one percent of your body weight per week to minimize muscle loss. But trying to do it fast and chewing up any muscle will mean you burn fewer calories at rest, so that'll be detrimental to your goals.\u00a0\n\nSlow and steady. Learn to be hungry and be okay with it. Learn to eat high-volume foods to stay full (air-popped popcorn; most veggies; some fruits). It's not a race to see who can get the thinnest the fastest. :)",

You can train 2-3 times a week but put more effort into those trainings. The diec will do the thing. \n\nBe disciplined, cut all the crap from your diet, plan your meals, eat healthy lowish calories foods and give it time. Eat less but don't starve yourself. Be honest with yourself about how many calories you are eating and if it's going in the right direction for you. If yes, keep the course.

It says 16% on your last picture but I believe you\u2019re most definitely over 20% bf. That\u2019s nothing to be mad about tho, just be consistent, track cals and you\u2019re gonna get there",
            "As for me it's about what kind of training sticks to you. If training at home works for you and you don't feel limited by your equipment then do it for sure! However, I would recommend exploring a gym and all the variety of equipment to gain that experience. Home gym is a bit of an advanced move for experienced people I think. It's when you train consistently and you know what works for you so you just want to save time/money on going to the gym. \n\nI go regularly to the gym at the moment because it fits my schedule. In case it doesn't we have a barbell with enough plates and some other basic things at home. Tomorrow might actually do a home training because the day's schedule will be pretty tight.",
            "Overall I think you just need to add more muscle all around. But you have some good chest and arm size.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nShoulders could use some specialized attention, I'd suggest some side delt specific movements like lateral raises at least twice a week to make them pop out.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe throw in some weighted ab movements if you want them to pop out as well. You're at a low enough body fat % where you could have visible abs if you add some size onto them.\u00a0\n\n\nCan't see your legs or back, are you happy with your progress on both?\u00a0",
            "You could do that by getting leaner. Smaller midsection will accentuate the rest. Or you can just keep on adding mass. How many calories you eating?",
            "I feel you, friend. I do the same thing when I'm hungry. One cup of popcorn can lead to eating the entire contents of my fridge!\n\nBut keep in mind that being so hungry you lose all willpower is what drives that powerful primal urge to eat, so our strategy should be to make sure the food we eat keeps us full(er). Cutting ain't never going to be fun, but with volume eating and making sure you get tons of protein in, hopefully it won't be too bad. You can do this!",

            "I have a coach who takes care of my programming, but yes, all of the above. I do weighted chins and dips every week and usually have bodyweight pull-ups as part of my conditioning (I did yesterday). I also close grip bench. Not doing too many other accessories atm.",
