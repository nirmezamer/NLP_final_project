This old variant however, is more aggressive, more hungry, way faster  and way smarter. \n\nAs it is old, it has more experience and developed intelligence...it notices how their prey always seeks out scraps, therefore, it can move scraps, puts valuable items in dark areas and makes a noticeable item drop sound to attract a curious player. Unlike the normal variant this one is super silent, doesn't make a hiss and is super sensitive to bright light sources, so staying in a bright area and having a Pro-Flash will save you and getting an apparatus could be a much bigger risk.",
