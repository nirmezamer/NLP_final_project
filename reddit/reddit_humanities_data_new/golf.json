            "I love Viktor, but it seems every time he's doing well, and i start to watch him, he loses it all. I feel like he's cursed whenever i start to watch him play.",
            "Jordan: smashes a nice draw off the tee, club twirl, doesn\u2019t watch it land \u2026. Right into the bunker",
            "Wow. Rickie had an amazing day.",
            "Matt Fitzpatrick is kinda on a suck streak. He made the cut at the US open then finished +13. Finished today at +5\n\nEdit: +4 for today but that's still good for T-67 - only one guy did worse",
            "Rickies putting was locked in. I might have to bust out some Puma polos this weekend lol",
            "Birthday Tom Kim new mythical golfer?",
            "Someone please get Jordan a real good sports psychologist.",
            "No one ever talks about Sung Jae Im but it seems like he's in top 10 every week lol",
            "The conspiracy all makes sense now. Bryson has been promoting himself on YouTube to be palatable to PGA fans. An agreement between Jay and PIF was that he needs to to win a major and go on a friendly PR tour to soften the blow of the eventual merger. Rory was given big money to lose and accidentally started sinking 20ft+ putts at a US Open on Sunday, so he had to throw on 16 and 18. Now for the first time ever I see a LIV livestream on my YouTube feed during a PGA weather delay. They played the algorithm beautifully to gain an extra 1,000 viewers.",
            "an withdrew?!?!?",
            "Has anyone played this course in real life? It's a fun layout to play in 2K23.",

            "Decent 29 from morikawa on the front 9",
            "the rough on the backside of 11 green should be cut way short so it rolls down into the waste, having long shots just stop on an uphill lie seems lame even if the rough is 5 inches long or whatever",
            "The current top 6 are partly or totally of Asian/Pacific Islander descent.",
            "It\u2019s like each hole they show has different weather. Gotta love Connecticut",
            "Haven\u2019t payed attention to coverage until just now when I got off work early. JT being 6 under is legit shocking",
            "They're letting guys lift, clean, and place when there are multiple people in double digits on Friday? Jfc this is lame golf",
            "Oh boy if Scottie is having those falling in he\u2019s going to destroy the field\u00a0",
            "Looks like Scottie\u2019s off to a good start",
            "How many times has \"highly improvisational shot there by Spieth\" been said in the past few years?",
            "will z -6?\n\nfirst time they have shown him.  weird",
            "LAME",
            "Alright folks, it's that time of the year again where I get to dish some observations from the course!\n\nI'll start off the big one: ShotLink is simply not as sophisticated for the volunteers as it had been since I started volunteering this event in 2013. Yes, we have all the cameras around the course tracking the balls, but it's become so automated that the tour doesn't even bother having the spotter volunteers learn the gadgets anymore, so all we have to do is follow balls in midair, track what they land in, and flag them if needed. It sucks, I loved using the lasers and the tablets and I didn't mind having that kind of job for a couple of rounds. Will I stop volunteering? Nah. Will I find something else to do next year--preferably a standard bearer or walking scorer? Depends on if there are slots available and I'm willing to work all the rounds they want me to.\n\nSo I was stationed on 3 fairway today, haven't been on that hole since one of the years Bubba Watson won (I remember it being overcast and dreary on Sunday). First time I've ever been on the shady side of the hole though, left of the fairway. Was very pleased at all the shade I had throughout the whole shift, almost as much as I've had on 10 the past two years. So that was a good start.\n\nSeeing the front left pin location, I expected a lot of misses wide right as well as a lot of less than driver off the tee to keep it in the wide part of the fairway. The first few groups seemed to defy both of those, but as it got later in the day and the fairway dried out, the players wisened up and took it easy, although there were still a few misses. Even saw a few balls bounce off the cart path, one going so far as to land on 4 fairway (Nick Taylor I think? I know it was one of the Canadians).\n\nApologies to Cam Davis, we nearly lost his ball in the fescue, but his caddie came in clutch, then *he* came in clutch after he punched out to save par and eventually posted a very nice 65.\n\nBrian Harman's waggles are absolutely legit even on Thursday. This is not him trolling for the camera.\n\nCameron Young and Patrick Rodgers' caddies *really* don't like Detroit Golf Club...either that or they don't mind the course but they don't like Detroit.\n\nLudvig Aberg and his caddie are two great guys. I flagged his ball because it was kinda in a blind spot in the hill and I wanted to give our tech a fair chance to properly confirm where it came to rest. (Mainly to make sure we got the right cut of rough.) It was barely sitting in the primary rough and was actually fairly visible, so I hoped it didn't come off as condescending to Ludvig, but I guess it didn't. He thanked me and his caddie got a kick out of me observing him using the sand rake to pull Ludvig's divot from his second shot out of the bunker. They're having a great year, why shouldn't they enjoy the little things?\n\nFinally, I think I've got an answer to that burning question I've had since Pebble Beach. I asked our tech between groups what was going on with the super late call to cancel the fourth round at Pebble and what would have happened if Wyndham and Ludvig were tied, rather than Wyndham one ahead. (I still feel the outright lead was a large part in the tour waiting as long as they did to call it.) He thinks they wouldn't have attempted a playoff on Sunday or Monday and that they'd have called it a split victory. So I guess some people are good with ties.\n\nI'll be back out on Saturday as I usually am! Probably back on 3, or maybe even 2, judging by my check-in time and if that rain looks looming I might get some shelter! Careful out there everyone!",
            "Akshay has been playing some pretty good golf the last couple of weeks. Hope he can put up 3 more low scoring rounds.",
            "that eagle was too easy for scottie",
            "Conners finally waking up",
            "Schefflers odds are not even worth it lol. Then again they probably are because he\u2019ll probably win again",
            "Gotta say it\u2019s gonna be a fun golf day today. Womens PGA should be shaping up to be a good one. The travelers is a fun post US Open tournament. Should be good golf today!",
            "Just started watching, what\u2019s the deal with guys (Hovland, Zala) getting club length relief around the green?",

            "Spieth is still outside the FedEx's Top 50. He still has time but that's terrible career management/worst case scenario from him. Either take time off and fix the injured wrist or make sure you're in that top 50. Taking that  time-consuming job on the board is also dumb AF. A whole season with nothing to show for on and off the course.",

            "Zalatoris is -7 but they've shown maybe 2 of his shots?",
            "Another birdie fest",
            "Let\u2019s go Rickie and Scottie and Postman!!!",
            "I've been wondering about the Brice Garnett guy who won the Puerto Rico open. I didn't see him in the US open field or in this weekend's \"signature\" event. I guess winning an alternate field event isn't enough to guarantee your appearance in such tournaments. Is anyone familiar with the rules and what you get (other than money and FedEx points) from winning such a tournament?",
            "From Tom Kim\u2019s back nine yesterday and front nine today, he -9 with no bogeys lol",

            "It\u2019s actually wild how Scottie is 2 back amongst an absurdly packed and talented leaderboard and everyone is like \u201ccongrats on the win!\u201d. He just has that inevitable aura when he\u2019s up there on the weekend.",

            "Tom Kim Jesus",
            "Malnati with the birdie birdie finish to beat Bezuidenhout by one as he bogeyed the final hole. Absolutely terrible play by Bezu. Dont even get me started on Will Zalatoris. Cant string two days of good play together on an easy course. Shame.",

            "do pro's even gain confidence beating up an easy course",
            "Any of you want to do a tier list for all the stupid things people yell when the player drives the ball: such as \"light the candle!\", \"mashed potato!\" and \"Baba Booey!\" I heard someone claim that during the US Open someone yelled, \"I shit my pants!\" but I did not hear this firsthand.",

            "I love that I can\u2019t even watch any golf on any of my TV channels right now. They don\u2019t show the women\u2019s PGA championship on any network in Canada and men\u2019s golf starts in another hour. I\u2019m glad golf central pregame is on when all the major pros are teeing off.",
            "Not that it matters but Wyndham Clark\u2019s fit today is garbage. White and blue polo with the black and pink T-mobile hat looks like a second grader who dressed themselves",

            "You may know me as an Aberg hater if you frequent this thread but one of my clients this week was a Swedish woman who made me lots of money so I saw it as a sign to bet on Aberg this week. So LfG lol",

            "Thanks for the super detailed updates every year!\n\nStandard Bearer is IMO the best volunteer position as long as you don't mind the walk and carrying a sign. Done it at 4 Canadian Opens (3 PGA and 1 LPGA). The only position with a front-row view of a group and pretty stress free since you can refer to the walking scorer if you lost track of score.\n\n>Cameron Young and Patrick Rodgers' caddies\u00a0*really*\u00a0don't like Detroit Golf Club...either that or they don't mind the course but they don't like Detroit\n\nDetroit GC is a pretty standard course with no huge hills so multiple **caddies** not liking it would be pretty interesting... I'll just assume it's the city.\n\n>He thinks they wouldn't have attempted a playoff on Sunday or Monday and that they'd have called it a split victory.\u00a0\n\nI imagine they'd split the purse and FedEx points, but one interesting question is whether it counts as an official PGA Tour win in the # of wins column or not (for example, Adam Scott winning at Riviera one year when it was shortened to 36 holes did not).",

Even without the bonus and without a fourth round to play, that win actually gave him slightly more points than when he won at Quail Hollow in 2023, as an event on the same tier (although that had a full 156 player field which might have affected its strength a bit). \n\nFor an even closer comparison of tournaments, Scheffler only got about 63.9 base points for his win at Hilton Head and Rory only scored 60.8 for his win at Quail Hollow this year. I'm not exactly sure how the strength of field calculations work these days, but that anomaly might have something to do with Scheffler; he theoretically can't score ranking points \"against himself\" so him winning Hilton Head might seen as slightly weaker than someone else beating him to win, and of course he sat out Quail Hollow which weakened the field a bit.",

            "Last year's tournament had what felt like a ludicrous number of rounds in the 60-62 range. It took almost all day for us to see our first and only 62 yesterday, and they're trying to beat some possible thunderstorms today so the course may stay firm and fast today. I'll predict the 36 hole lead around -11 or -12 and then we'll see what happens over the weekend since there's a chance for more storms tomorrow.\n\nEDIT: My prediction is already false, Tom Kim is in at -13, but the afternoon wave isn't going that deep. Doesn't look like we'll have a ton of players at double digits under after 36 holes.",

            "there are indeed many elements that amateurs should, and can fairly easily strive for.  It's not too dependent on timing and maximum effort, which is the bane of everyday amateurs.\n\nI'd start with looking at his stability, his weight shift onto the right leg, his redirection to a shallower downswing is natural, and he finishes with 95% of his weight on his left foot. Notice how he pushes the club straight back instead of jerking it with his hands. All of these are readily adoptable fundamentals. And he doesn't pass parallel, for the Daly-wannabes among us\n\nHe does the drop down to hit up on the ball, with a lot of ground force, which is the key \"expert timing\" for his distance.",

Then top speed at impact with his hands, arms, and feet launching into the ball. Hitting slightly up on the ball at impact from the leg launch cuts down on the back spin which increases distance. It's a phenomenal swing and imo top 5 in the history of golf. \n\nEven Tiger tells his son to watch Rorys swing over his. The amount of power Rory can generate with his frame is insane being that he's only 5'9\".",

In reality the ball will be so close but not so far after you give it a full swing (unless you miss the fairway)\u2026\n\nIn reality I hate this game \u2026 again and again, but in theory I\u2018m in love with it.",

If you watch him play he aims like 30 yards left to account for this. Now I shall state that I am a plus 1 handicap. I suck at golf compared to Rory and should never judge him but at the same time know a thing or two and have made a living teaching beginner golfers for a year.

            "The way he loads his back hip and just the precision of his lower body. You can the see the power production there and everything upper body catches the timing perfectly on the transition and path forward. You can see the hip coil and all that power fire as soon as he starts moving forward. Upper body is effortless because it\u2019s following the path the hips have already set. I would say the separation of hips and shoulders is what makes it so perfect. Violence in the lower half to generate the power yet consistent timing with limited effort in the upper half. A swing that can play for a very long time and become more consistent with age. Similar to Phil Mickelson. Different use of hip angles but from opposite sides, pretty similar swings. Phil won a PGA in his 50s. Rory has a similar projection in my eyes",

            "It's because his hands and arms are very deep in P5 and he swings very in to out.  Thus creating the high draw ball flight that most hacks envy.  This is also why he struggles on certain courses and is very one dimensional.  Great for hitting bombs, not great for overall control and playability",
            "Its the way he pulls his club down with the leftside muscles of his back that does it for me. I get good shoulder and hip rotation and can get my ass in to it and im 4 inches taller than him. Im pretty sure his extra 40 yards of carry over me come from being able to pull hard with his back muscles without closing the clubface",
            "The way he transfers his pressure is elite. Perfect sequencing and organization.\n\nIf there's one thing to study it's that.\n\nThe rest of it takes a level of conditioning and setup that probably should be left alone by the average golfer unless you already use a weaker trail hand.",

Not a golf expert, but I believe that the higher your angle of attack is upward (to a certain point) reduces the spin on the ball, and reduces the drag. If you look he gets real low, and then once the club starts to go upward on his swing plane, he starts to stand up, just adding a bit more.\n\nObviously, that's just optimized with a high swing speed and boom.",

Some kids want to swing like Corey Seager but that one is a little complicated for kids. \n\nGist is, unless their parents are their swing coach or they\u2019re paying for one, I always try to teach them something simple. Bregman (I know he\u2019s not loved outside of the Astros fanbase) IMO has the most simplistic and repeatable swing for a young kid (6-10) to learn and try to emulate. Bryce Harper is another good one.\n\nJr\u2019s swing was aesthetically beautiful but he did some unique things which made it hard to copy well. It was my favorite swing growing up.",

If you can't do the technique properly it means you have an injury or muscular imbalance preventing you from doing so. A lot of the time those imbalances have existed for so long you don't even realize that you're moving \"incorrectly,\" so doing your best to max out your technique is often a good way of identifying those imbalances that you might not otherwise even realize exist.",

That\u2019s really been a major help with both consistency and distance for me.  I\u2019d let my trail elbow fold too much. This video is a perfect example of what he was teaching.",

And even then, its just a little bit laterally.",

Plot thins as their average swing speed fails to reach 100mph, let alone break it.\n\nHere\u2019s what really happens when you measure it: average your hand speed from address to impact is about 1 second, Rory\u2019s is 0.9, whereas the average low and slow spamming screwball mentioned earlier takes way more than a second to get from address to impact. It\u2019s one of the eye-opening differences you\u2019ll see with other useful tools like the Tour Tempo (highly recommended, by the way).",

            "Golf is the same and no one should be trying to copy Rory McIlroy's swing. He is able to do things anatomically (range of core rotation, for instance) that most people can't (including most other Tour pros), and in general the male pros' degree of speed and strength conditioning puts their swings out of reach.",

Hopefully in a few years he\u2019ll realize he should probably find a middle ground between swinging out of your shoes and being a singles machine.",

It \u201clooks\u201d so simple, because he is not even at the full range of his mobility. However, ask your local weekend hacker to get their arms as deep as Rory and they won\u2019t be able to make a downswing from that position. \n\nAgree with your post, you can try to emulate a lot of what he does, but to actually *look* like Rory is a pipe dream for the vast majority of amateurs. It\u2019s beautiful tho.",
            "Yeah. I\u2019d say Aberg is the only \u201csimpler\u201d swing that generates a ton of power, but he\u2019s also tall so doesn\u2019t need to do what Rory does.",
            "The thing is Rory\u2019s core is both ridiculously flexible and strong. Most people replicating this swing will not get the same result as Rory, but will subconsciously expect it.\n\nThat IMO is the biggest hurdle. You have to work up to the strength and distance, but rarely are people able to stick with it long enough for it to happen and will likely deviate along the way.",

It forces them to just put the bat on the ball.\n\n[Here\u2019s my kid doing it](https://imgur.com/a/Og949BP)\n\nThis speed is faster than coach pitch so it\u2019s good for this drill.

            "With those mental gymnastics, it's no surprise to see why the better players get better while the not so good players stagnate. If not get worse.\n\nObviously there's no overnight changes, it's as realistic as expecting a child to run before they learned how to crawl, it's also not realistic to expect every single movement and angle copied and pasted verbatim, etc. But there's plenty to learn from the better players and longer hitters such as Rory to claw out of that rut (ie: swing faster, get more athletic, get stronger to make it more sustainable, etc) instead of retaining the quitter mentality (more appropriate for AA) and definitely instead of the more commonplace, \"confidential\" angry downvote brigading devoid of critical thought and/or word salad that could've been simplified by saying you guys neither want nor deserve the gifts of learning what you can take to your game to hit bombs and improve, for a nice change of pace.",

Problem became our leadoff hitter is a taller/athletic beast who kills the ball & my son wanted to hit it like him. He started swinging harder & was dropping his hands which caused a 3-4 game mid-season slump as I had to re-train my son for a contact swing. Told him he could worry about hitting for power later on.\n\nIt\u2019s actually funny, my philosophy is completely opposite for golf. I get him to swing out of his shoes in golf with the plan to rein it in later. Reason being, you don\u2019t need to worry about the ball moving in golf.\n\n[Golf swing](https://imgur.com/a/aBnfEED)",
