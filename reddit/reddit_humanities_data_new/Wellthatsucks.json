However, some patients and caretakers provided inaccurate pesticide poisoning history. Due to its availability in hospitals, doctors largely relied on atropine to manage pesticide poisoning cases whether or not relevant to treat the actual pesticide active ingredient responsible for the poisoning. Although majority of the cases treated recovered, those due to suicide were further referred to the hospital psychiatrist. Sharing experiences of managing pesticide poisoning patients among health workers and engaging in sensitization outreaches against pesticide poisoning were reported as potential activities to improve quality of care for pesticide poisoning patients.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine\n\n>Atropine is a tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery.[6] It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle.[6] Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia.[7][8] The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour.[5] Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings.[6]",

The issue is that these management companies have their own deck of sub contractors that they don\u2019t have any incentive to negotiate with as they don\u2019t pay them directly, but rather the guests pays. So, these service providers charge outrageous rates and the management company requires us and the guests to use them. \n\nOur own property ends up having a ludicrous fee as well that even we are required to pay when we use our own house. This fees are something like $150 for trash service, $150 for laundry, $500 cleaning, $100 inspection. Suddenly, every stay is a $900 \u201chost fee\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s a broken system. The solution is that these fees shouldn\u2019t be allowed, and thus the management company should be forced to either take a bigger cut (which would result in management co competition and homeowner negotiations) or negotiate with service providers for reasonable rates so that they can cover all of this with a 15% cut.

Add in the already tight rental market due to the numerous colleges and the issue with some people renting airbnbs for parties it didnt take long for residents to start getting organized and the city to crack down. It should be ok a homeowner who is going to be on vacation and wants to rent out their place while away. I had a high school friend who grew up in Charlestown, he would rent out when he went to NH for the summer and make some bank for little to no work. He just had to make sure his personal stuff was removed and rented it out while gone. I have no issues with that, or even if you own a multifamily where you live on the property and rent one or both that way. But buying up dozens of properties and removing them from the market is just fucking greedy.

So once anything pushes prices up a bit, that's it, they're stuck there forever.\n\nThe only solution is non-market supply (co-op housing, social housing, land trusts, etc.), as that isn't supplied for profit, and so doesn't care if prices go down.\n\nSo it's possible that AirBnB caused a temporary shortage that pushed prices up, and now they're stuck there even if AirBnB is banned.

            "One morning a few years ago I was walking to my car to go to work when I saw what looked like money blowing down the middle of my street. I grabbed it and it was a $100 bill, so I was of course stoked. I put it in my pocket and drove away. At work I pulled it out to show off to my coworkers my good fortune, when I saw some Chinese writing on it, Google Translate told me it said \"play money\" or something like that. So then I was sad, but whatever. It ended up in my car, in a little cubby under the stereo. Fast forward a month or so and I met up with a friend who was going through some hard times. She lived about 2 hours away from me- she had lost her job and she and her son were on the brink of homelessness, so I took them out to lunch, bought them a bag of groceries and supplies, and then I drove us to a park so her kid could play and just be a kid. She mentioned to me that she had left something in my car and she would be right back. No problem. After a while I had to get rolling home so we packed up and we drove to a hotel and I paid for a room for two nights, we said our goodbyes and I left. A couple of days later I was looking for something in my car when I noticed that the fake $100 was gone. She had obviously seen it, and when she excused herself to go back to my car she pinched it. At first I was worried that she would try to spend it and get in trouble, or at least get hassled, but then I realized- after all of my friendship, support, and goodwill, she still stole money from me, whether it was bogus money or not. I haven't spoken to her since.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu8fkovr5z7d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92a3253d4bd4e32c0614075c10f458a89a39b3e8",

I think it\u2019s a seriously shitty thing to do, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d arrest and charge someone for this. If they did, people would be getting arrested and charged for it all the flipping time. I believe because it is a gratuity, rather than payment for service, that it is treated differently.",

            "Nobody uses it in the south. It's always white sugar. \n\nThis smacks of 10 years ago when maple syrup was \"a healthier sweetener.\" Lol. No. It's all fructose, glucose, and sucrose.",
            "Syrup of course! Just a nice shot to start your day off right.",
            "Just a bit.",
            "![gif](giphy|asHT7eh4AwG9G)",
            "You said \"don't overdo it\" which is kind of against the whole principle of Sweet Tea.\n\nI can't stand it either. And I hate the fact that I have to order \"unsweetened tea\" because that sugary atrocity has become the default even here in Northern California.  Like, do they take the sweetener out of it?  For thousands of years tea has been the simplest of recipes, leaves and water.  Now it needs to have sugar removed first?",
            "The mustard greens are the after war rewards, right?",
            "https://i.redd.it/8jywmwr5438d1.gif",
            "Yeah. Hands would be thrown if someone tried to put that in my tea. Pure white cane sugar only!",
            "Rotflmao",
            "I'm not from anywhere near the south, and even I know better!",
            "Maple syrup bud",
            "\u2018Bout choked on my collard greens at this one.",
            "I tastes amazing in some hot milk with vanilla and nutmeg as well, I honestly prefer it to honey as a sweetener.",
            "Wouldn't the syrup still be pretty much rock hard and not mix well in a cold drink?",
            "As a Canadian, I too can confirm; am confused and worried.",
            "I meant him calling it sweet tea and not iced tea.",
            "Caters to southerners in that they're calling it \"sweet tea\" and not \"iced tea\" lol. We very much love our version of iced tea up here too, without any maple syrup. I dare say our version even goes beyond sweet tea in terms of it being sugar with a side of tea...",
            "i've heard of honey for that purpose but not maple. 'tho i guess it's along the same concept",
            "People put honey in sweet tea? Hot tea with honey I've heard of but not iced.",
            "I\u2019m from Canada and definitely put maple syrup in tea!!",
            "i would wear this shit \ud83d\udca9",
            "Everything else. Candy, pancakes, desserts, home made pork sausages\n\nNothing beats real maple syrup on fresh snowfall and rolled into stick. I hate to even say I\u2019m ready for the first snowfall to make some.",
            "Or a hummingbird",
            "Holy shit you're right\n\nI do endurance cycling, sweet tea would be an amazing way to drink carbs. However I'm up in Quebec, so I'm stuck drinking straight maple syrup on 4+ hour rides.",
            "Or for those days when you\u2019re doing high sets of deadlifts and trying not to puke and pass out",
            "Plus this is Costco so they probably took the picture to get a refund. I doubt this picture has anything to do with sweet tea.",
            "I could see preferring maple syrup over refined white sugar for a lot of things, tea ain\u2019t it. You\u2019d have to use so much it would just taste like maple!",
            "No one even uses maple syrup for pancakes in the South. It's all butter pecan.",
            "The reason it is seen as healthier is that in equal amounts (by volume), you get basically the same calories and grams of sugar but you actually get nutrients like manganese, zinc, b1 whioe ij sugar you get nothing. Also it is less sweet than sugar due to a higher proportion of sucrose so it can be preferred for people that don't like they strong sweetness taste from processed sugar.\n\nAlso since maple syrup is more dense, if you instead do a gram to gram swap, you sill cut you sugar and calories",
            "Oh. I'm canadian, i never think of usa for maple syrup to be honest haha.",
            "I could accept light brown\u2026 but only when I was still like super broke. So if you\u2019re struggling and give me tea with brown sugar we\u2019re good. Anyone else, we have to fight.",
            "I like cane sugar and vanilla in my hot milk. Delicious. \n\n(My fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019m a heathen for heating up my milk tho).",
            "Depends on if you stir it in while room temp. or warm, I guess. Idk for sure at all. I've also never had rock hard maple syrup ever though. Just gets more viscous in my limited experience.\n\nEdit: My autocorrect changed viscous to vicious.",
            "I\u2019m sorry. (See what I did there?)",
            "It\u2019s iced tea down here too. Sweet iced tea or unsweetened iced tea. \u201cSweet tea\u201d is just shorthand for the former.",
            "Probably because we have so much product easily available. I produce beef also and that\u2019s the same thing, instead of going to the groceries store you look in the freezer/pantry and start there",
            "It's absolutely delicious. I use it my homemade coffee creamer and in several sweet, hot drinks instead of sugar. Vastly prefer it to honey.",
            "They said \"a sweet tea\" so maybe just maple in a black tea rather than southern sweet tea.",
            "Bahaha! My bad!",
            "I fail to see a problem with this.\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
            "Very true. It\u2019s always just regular table syrup or the sugar free kind, ironically. I actually introduced a lot of my friends to maple syrup and blew their minds!",
            "I'm from the south and my folks always bought real maple syrup. \n\nIt wasn't common though, true.\n\nedit: Even Cracker Barrel has real maple syrup.",
            "Oh lol well Vermont is kind of like Canada lite. We have the syrup, moose and snow.",
            "If there\u2019s no packet of chocolate powder involved your fianc\u00e9 is right. Heathen.",
            "Y'know, when I was a kid, I thought hot milk was a sin against humanity. Now that I'm older, I think it's a delicious nighttime treat that I genuinely look forward to. Maybe it's a thing for olds?",
            "The beef part I completely understand as someone who has 2 massive freezers dedicated to locally produced meats",
            "I'm definitely going to try it sometime",
            "Ngl I like maple but only with certain things and what you just described sounds awful to me lol but hey y'all do you",
            "I mean, yeah, I love maple as much as the next hoser-American, but there\u2019s way better ways to enjoy it",
            "Oh nice. I don't hear about the state of Vermont much that's all. Sounds nice. It's one of the few states I rarely hear about.",
            "I agree",
            "It\u2019s worth a visit is you ever come to the US. It\u2019s very small and not a lot happens here but it\u2019s beautiful."
