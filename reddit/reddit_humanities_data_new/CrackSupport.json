Few of the examples: \n\n[Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/ONDqFia.png)\n[Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/WpcJeBS.png)\n[Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/v1I0lB7.png)\n\nTo ensure this subreddit continues to operate and not get banned by Reddit admins, we are shutting down all the support about software-related content. You can only ask for content related to video games. All of the future questions about software piracy will be deleted.\n\nI am sorry that this happened, but such measures have to be taken to ensure this subreddit continues to operate. You can create another subreddit related to software piracy, though I would not advise, as Reddit is more likely to take down content related to software piracy than video game piracy. \n\nAll of the previous questions relating to software piracy will be deleted to avoid more copyright strikes.",

            "The thing is, one guy buys it, he uploads it to *a torrent site*, then instead of let's say a 1000 people, only 300 buys it. What was your budget to make the game? \u20ac4000. What's your income based on the buyers? \u20ac200. Why did u price it low? \"so anyone could buy it\". Then the small \"studio\" / solo dev resigns, because they couldn't earn enough money.\n\nIt's like you buy a piece of art from an artist, then you make copies of it and put it out next door as \"free copies\".\nYou're somewhat right; it's not necessarily stealing. But it's a way of cutting the developers from important money.\n\nSure, I don't talk about dogshit companies like fucking blizzard, or Riot, etc... But the devs of WorldBox for example? Shit they're the fucking best! They listen to their community, they give us great content, so why bankrupt them like I mentioned hundreds of times?",

            "No one's saying it's not an issue, or that it's not unfair. It's just not the same as actual theft, which is what you used in all of your inane examples. Theft is primarily a crime because it deprives others of their property. To which they may have utilitarian value, or be able to profit from or so on, depending on what it is. If I steal someone's car, they can't drive to the shops. That's an impediment on their life. They also can't sell that car to someone else. That's a loss of money.   \nBut, if that car is digital and I copy it without permission, the effects are not the same. Frankly, they would not even notice in most cases; they can still drive to the shops, and they can still sell it. Where it becomes an ethical quandary is cases wherein one may give away copies of that car for free to the possible prospective buyers of that car, damaging the ability of the person to sell their original copy of the car for what it was originally worth. However, you can't turn around and say that all the people who took the free copies, *were* actual prospective buyers - if I ask someone if they want a cookie for $5, and then I ask someone else if they want a cookie for free, which is more likely to get more hits? The latter, every time. And not by a little, but by a lot. So actually determining what the damages are or if there even are any at all, is definitely an imperfect science, and honestly closer to guesswork in most cases. Especially seeing as in the case of game piracy it can actually rebound with beneficial effects, serving as a modern day demo (something which used to be widespread in the games industry). I myself have bought many games that I originally pirated to try out, both to reward the developer for a good product and to get future updates/support. Do the anti-piracy crowd ever factor such effects in? Not really. They'd much rather froth at the mouth about the millions of downloads worth of illusionary money they 'lost'.",
