A loss is a loss, and it\u2019s not what anyone wants\u2026but I love seeing the offense fight back. Now, with the devastating injuries and shaky outings of late, the pitching staff is going to need some work\u2026but at least the offense is hot.",

Likely Bryan Abreu won\u2019t pitch again in the series now. Birds won\u2019t have to face bad Abreu either, as he is at home in Florida earning his $30 million dollar salary for not playing.",
            "Oof\u2026those retained and injury payrolls always sting a bit. The Astros definitely had a good game against one of our best pitchers this season. I know their record doesn\u2019t show it yet, but the remain a threat. Adley, Gunnar, and Santander are definitely on fire lately. Let\u2019s see how the rest of the series unfolds. I swear I am always shaking my fist at Altuve when we face the Astros. Last game I was able to go to in Baltimore, he was also the one to make me groan in frustration. \ud83d\ude02"

If he does, he must return to the base before the ball is thrown to the base or he is put out (he returns to the bench and no longer participates in the play for the batting team). When the batting team accumulates 3 outs in their half of the inning, it ends the inning and the teams switch between playing offense and defense. \n\nIn this play, the batting team was losing and was taking their last half inning as the batting team. If they fail to tie or take the lead before getting 3 outs, they lose the game. The batter hit a fly ball that was very easy for the defence to catch on the fly. This put the batter out leaving the batting team at 2/3 outs. In this circumstance the runner is meant to stay near his base so that he can easily return to it and not be put out, which ends the game. However he apparently thought that there were 2 outs. If that were the case then he is supposed to try and advance as far as he can. On the off chance that the defender makes a blunder and does not catch the ball he can advance very far. If the ball is caught (as it normally will be) the half inning is immediately over with the catch making the third out.",
