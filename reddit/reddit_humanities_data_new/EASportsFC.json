I use R1 + Circle.\n\nHow can I get my players to press, why when I get the ball I am surrounded by opponents but when they get the ball my players go picnic?(even with 2nd man press)\n\nWhy do my opponents players perform gymnastics moves to intercept my passing lanes easily, and my players, placed perfectly, seem to ignore the ball, or, even if they touch it, it gets back to the opponent?\n\nWhy does my 97 rated keeper NEVER catch the ball?

            "All that you just mentioned, it happens vice-versa, the sad thing is that we're all guilty of being oblivious to it and only notice and complain when it happens to us, so what I can say though is try not to let get to you, if you can tell that you're going to lose your head, take a breather, maybe chill off the game for a bit, relax coz yes the game can get really intense and frustrating at times. \n\nSo while I can't really give you the answers you were looking for, the one thing I can say is to help with your mental illness, don't let the game consume you like this, the calmer you are, the more relaxed you, the better you'll be at managing games rather than making rash challenges or getting frustrated by how your opponent did something. \n\nHope that helps in some way.",
            "Provocative post. Those things happen against us but also in our favour, but we simply ignore them when we win. The only thing I hate is those flick volleys and corners but it's just poor gamecode, keep in mind we had el tornado crosses spam in pro tournaments back in a day",
            "Honestly best thing I did recently was experiment with different formations rather than chase the meta 4321 and work out what works best for me and my playstyle and then find the best players to work with that formation. Will take some time to adapt but worth it and you will have more fun on the game",
            "That's just your perception. The game isn't coded speciifically against you and your opponents likely feel the same from time to time.\n\n\n\n1) it does make a difference but not massive. Relentless and relentless+ especially are fantastic playstyles and you can basically use a relentless+ player on full stamina for 120 mins on any pressing tactic. Midfielders under 94 stamina with no relentless will be done by 70\n\n\n\n2) I think bruiser helps with that behind tackle. But r1+O is just for strong tackle and has a slower animation you only really want to you use it front on.  If you are using advanced defending the seal out is best for that tackle.\n\n\n\n3) team press, constant pressure, 2nd man press, good manual defending and player switching \n\n\n\n4) intercept+ does get some good animations but otherwise you're passing too close to them. Pinged passing with a player with the playstyle is usually good at getting through. And although rare, Tiki taka+ gets through when it really shouldn't.\n\n\n\n5) mostly to do with the shot type you're facing if they are finessing far post and you move your keeper that way they catch it a little more often. But finesse and power shots often get you a corner.\n\n\n\n6) player lock isn't a gimmick. It's a good feature that finally gave us an answer to bad AI runs and is a good balance of requiring some skill and being rewarded. Very few players around 900+ skill rating just ignore it completely.",
            "My last opponent won 5-2 he scored from 2 cross play and 3 corners. His strikers are Drogba and of course 97 Haaland. And I have both CBs with Aerial+. Besides this, I Have all the same problems you just mentioned.",
            "This kind of stuff happens to everyone. It\u2019s got nothing to do with how good or bad you are at the game, these things will still happen unfortunately. It\u2019s mainly down to the game. Obviously there are a few things you can do to get yourself out of these situations. For instance, when you feel like your players are getting chased down by a defender and they are going to catch you, be ready for it. Slow down your player as they get closer to try and turn them as if they don\u2019t let go of sprint they will go straight past you. If you\u2019re near the touch line and don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible, try and win the throw so you keep the ball. The thing with all the things mentioned is, you will get these things happen in your favour as well in some games",
            "Best way to get better is to watch better players play.\n\nJohn sims on youtube has a lot of videos breaking down his gameplay and hes a top 200 player.",
            "My mindset is based around trying to minimize the \u201crandomness\u201d as much as possible. My personal biggest improvement from 11 to 14-16 wins and finally 18 wins this past weekend has been remaining patient on defense and trusting that I will eventually win the ball back with second man pressing. Defense was/is my biggest weakness by far, so this might not even be relevant to you. \nOther small details that have helped me minimize randomness include utilizing powershot+. That really helps me in those games where it feels like their keeper is saving everything, including finesses that I would regularly be scoring. Green timed finishes have also significant improved my conversion rate, particularly on finesses. \nTakes a few games to get comfy with these mechanics, but it\u2019s very worth it. And somebody at your level is very capable at picking up these skills quickly. Best of luck to you going forward!",
            "Bro you're rockin the 4321 with direct passing, off course you're going to be vulnerable defensively. Your tactics relies on outscoring your op in the 1st half. Direct passing will drain your teams stamina, no wonder why you don't use other game mechanics, that tactic will spread out your players and drain their stamina.",
            "You're not average if you're div 2.\n\nAverage is div5-7.",
            "I\u2019m sorry but this doesn\u2019t make any sense. If it happens to all of us all the time, then why are there players with 20 wins? For sure there must be a skillset combined with a tactic that allows you to bypass the broken game mechanic.\n\nAlso, you are right about the nervousness, I think keeping a cool head even when the game is bollocks gives you a massive advantage",
            "It isn't even because of connection.",
            "If it happens to all of us, then why are there players with 20 wins all the time? \n\nI\u2019m sure a great part of it is skill and calmness, but also tactics, specific button presses, D-Pad stuff all matter. Where should an average player like me focus to improve?",
            "Of course they also happen in my favour, but the proportion is terrible, and surely there are ways to enforce it happens and evade it. What\u2019s the big secret here?",
            "I don\u2019t think you can measure average vs non average players in Rivals. Anything below Elite is pretty much full casual since matchmaking is not tied to Divisions. Average is 11-14 wins in WL I\u2019d say.",
            "Watch Harry Hesketh for example, he has a massive amount of games where he is down by 2/3 due to random crap happening, they are just simply too good at multitasking and seeing plays in advance that they can win somehow. Also they have best connection available and you need to consider their composure while playing",
            "There\u2019s a lot of subtle user control that better players are doing on defense that folks won\u2019t pick up on. Even something like the second man press, there\u2019s a skill to getting the right players to press and picking the right player to user. Make sure you\u2019re using the R1 double tap and hold  in order to man mark.",
            "There are a lot of factors but the ones you mentioned, it happened to everyone, the reason why so many people go 20 and 0 is that they don't lose their head and I'm being serious about that, it sounds dumb but trust me when I say, you can make a comeback just be keeping cool, obviously if you play to the meta it's easier, if you tend to do the sweaty stuff like cutbacks, crossing and so on, it's easier but that's all down to your playstyle, with tactics, you can't just rely on tactics, your personal playstyle still affects it, me personally, I have 2 setups, ones my more balanced 4321 and then my constant press setup when  I'm down or if it's a tight game but even then, I tweak them mid-game, like the width, the depth all depending on how my opponent is playing.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that there's only so far that tactics and setups or using glitchy mechanics can take you, even with all the cheese that happens in games, there is a huge tactical side to it, like knowing when to team press, use the offside, when to 2nd man press or use the double r1 to instead mark runs while you manually track their player, knowing which pass to make, when to make the extra pass or just go for goal, shots and shot types to take, all of those are stuff you just figure out and learn and even then, sometimes you just gotta accept that your opponent bested you. \n\nHopefully, that's helpful, it's a combination of a lot of things. My way of looking at how to improve is when I lose, I watch the game back to see where I made mistakes (obviously not every loss now but now and then)",
            "A lot of the time they switch the ball. If you show a willingness to switch, take your man with some skill moves and best the press consistently you\u2019ll notice a lot of players switch up and be less aggressive on the defence. \n\nFor a lot of us, that simply isn\u2019t possible but for your 20 win players that\u2019s an average Tuesday.",
            "Start with your mentality.  You think the game is specifically out to favour your opponent and give them more stamina than you.  It honestly isn't we play the same game.",
            "\u201cSpecific button presses\u201d is the skill in every video game ever made. People get 20 wins because they\u2019re better players than you, not because the randomness \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen to them\u201d. Agreed with the other commenter, you need to assess your mentality. This game sucks but it isn\u2019t against you specifically. \n\nIf it\u2019s truly giving you mental distress, stop playing. No game is worth that.",
            "I would suggest just working on your overall gameplay, the meta changes every year but fundamentally if you have a good understanding of using skill moves and lb triggers as well as identifying space when attacking and good manual defending in terms of first isolating passing lanes then closing down the player with the ball and not overexposing when defending it will help your rank not only for the rest of this game but for future games.  You obviously still have to adapt to the meta in terms of finishing angles, effective skill moves and passing and defending options but if you work on identifying the areas of the game you're good at and figuring out a way to play that suits your skills it will benefit you a lot in the long term. Work on things like identifying versatile skill moves like mcgeady spin, stepovers or croquetas and practice them so that you can reliably execute them or for defending work on first positining your defender to block the most threatening and/or passing option depending on the context and then close down the attacker without overcommitting.\n\nThis game is broken and infuriating but youre benefitting at times from the exact issues youre mentioning you just dont notice them near as much when youre benefitting from them. I get 14+ wins in weekend league and have been in the elite division since the second week of the game. I dont use technical dribbling, none of my attackers are above 5'10, I dont playerlock or use most of the other 'gimmicks' you mention. If you're strugging to get past div 2 and 7 wins in weekend league its not the game targeting you and yes there is a tonne of ways this fifa to exploit broken mechanics and this is really tough to play against but to do better you need to just develop your overall gameplay by the sounds of it.",
            "That\u2019s actually probably not true. If you\u2019re wanting to get better at the game, you need to be fully honest with yourself about your games and how they play out because then you\u2019ll be able to see stuff happening in game and think right that\u2019s just the game or actually right that ones of me, then you can try and work on the things you can improve and you\u2019ll also find that the things you\u2019re already good at, you will become better at than you already are.",
            "Yes, Harry is probably the best person to watch when it comes to this kind of stuff, he scores all kinds of goals, you see him not lose his head, and keeps his composure, personally would like to see him back in the pro scene.",
            "One thing I will say is that a lot of us have spent an absurd amount of time on the game, which does help when you're looking to fine-tune certain mechanics, like for example player locking, it's not something you can just pick up and be a threat with, it comes with practice and then fine-tuning when to press, when not to press or fine-tuning your playstyles and knowing one pkaystyle doesn't always work and you need to be able to adapt midgame"
