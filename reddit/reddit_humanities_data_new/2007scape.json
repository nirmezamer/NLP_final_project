            "first things first, the best case scenario for this is to have symmetrical switches i.e. the same slots for each gear\n\n2nd, consider vertical switches. for numbers of less than 8, vertical switches make a lot of sense",
            "1: organize your switches. Keep them in consistent positions so that you'll always know where to look and what you're looking at in your inventory. E.g. you may have the weapon be the top left switch of every setup, shield slot  top right, necklace middle left,  etc. As long as it's the same for all setup (at least, for items that you have a switch for every combat style), you constrain the chaos to a specific area in your inventory\n\n2: inventory tags. This is the prime use case for them. They make things more recognizable at a glance. Color each switch with its appropriate RGB color. For hybrid switches, use the secondary color that's a combination of the others e.g. barrows gloves are ranged/melee, so make it R+G=yellow.\n\n3: anti drag plugin. Less chaos if you don't miss your switches. I personally have serious issues trying to play without anti drag on, as I'll frequently slide gear around when I'm trying to quickly switch. \n\n4: consider switching back to a default setup in between your switches. E.g. if your default style is melee and you need to switch range->mage, think about switching range->melee->mage. It will be slower and more clicks, but mage gear will stay in the mage side of your inv and range stuff will stay on range side",
            "It feels much nicer to use now. At the very least, I wouldn\u2019t commit to buying the axe unless you\u2019ll stick at vard until you get an ultor.

            "If you plan to grind out Vard and Duke and don't wanna megarare rebuild to keep access to a wider variety of content with all of your gear, then yeah Soulreaper Axe is pretty decent now.\n\nAcb and Spectral are pretty low priority generally. Spectral is almost exclusively for Cerberus, and ACB for Nex (though in my experience Nex before you have at least a ZCB is a lot less enjoyable lol).\n\nThe rest of the gear you'd keep is pretty great. Leaves you with really good gear for Slayer, ToA, CoX, and the Soulreaper will also be useful for you at TOB potentially.",

The difference is 3.8 dps on melee slash (maximising str) - vs 4.4 on fire blast in full ahrim with damned. TTK: 83s melee, 71 magic. (Updated the full ahrim setup with damned, thats even better!)\n\nBoth setups are very budget. The difference is serious, I'd say. Probably for maxed players in BiS gear it might be quite another story.\n\nI'd imagine the majority of players who do Hespori are low-to-mid levels who do it for the bucket or anima seeds.

            "Just throwing this in here after reporting it in-game a while ago.\n\n[On May 23rd an update was made to change normal-mode ToB Verzik p2 to scale for solo play](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/minigame-tweaks-skilling-adjustments--more?oldschool=1). Basically two changes if there's only one player still alive.\n\n1. Only one red crab spawns (instead of two). This makes it possible to out-dps Verzik's healing.\n\n2. The zap damage is capped from ~50 down to 14. This makes tick-eating zaps not always necessary.\n\n\\#1 works properly but #2 is bugged. In a solo ToB it functions properly, but if the raid was not initially a solo, it doesn't scale down. The zap continues to hit between 45-50 even with only one player still alive.\n\nThis actually makes duo tobs where one player dies on Verzik *harder* than solos, because you still have to kill Verzik by yourself, but through all of p2 you also have to deal with zaps taking 50% of your hp with no counterplay. Unless your 2nd player dies right at the end of p2.5, it's basically impossible to clear since people don't typically bring sweets for non-solo ToBs and the only real option you have is to tick eat with brews, which are both a limited resource and massively drop your dps. So while the changes properly made solos less annoying, they didn't actually improve the situation where someone in a duo dies, making Verzik entirely uncompletable.\n\nTo reproduce this, do a duo and have one player die during p2 Verzik. Note that the zap is still hitting 45-50 damage. This does not occur when doing a solo ToB.",

If all 50 players stayed in, they'd get the same amount of fish as using the method to put it on one person. Also, it's completely not viable to do more than two alts or so for the person staying.

The majority of the Trawler grind ended up just being community pings for anyone willing to donate time at Trawler to boost exp within the busted mechanics found. Most of the time it was a group of ~10 people hanging out in voice resulting in a ~30k exp drop every 6ish minutes. Near the very end (last 2 levels or so) Hannanie was reached out to and she wrangled up a huge crew of people with the hopes of setting the world record for highest single exp drop in the fishing skill, which was achieved! However there were some limitations as once you got around 75k exp the game would get insanely laggy while checking the net and around 80k exp you'd get force logged out and would receive nothing. \n\nIt was a rare opportunity for a Chunk YT community to be able to donate time and hang out together to expedite a future video by using some pretty novel and janky old mechanics. To me the process of figuring out an unknown mechanic for the first time on a 20 year old mini game and pushing it to its limits is a far more interesting video than waiting 2 months to watch a 3 minute super cut of 200 hours of Fishing Trawler.",

It would've been super easy to abuse with bots, which we obviously didn't.\n\nThe exact numbers will be in a YouTube video at some point, I hope :)",

            "As someone who spent a good 12 or so hours at Trawler over 2 weeks and received nearly 0 fishing exp (you're bound to miss a logout at some point), it ended up being a surprisingly good time because of the friends and community. I was able to get in a fair amount of bolt tipping for nearly 500k fletching exp plus went through about 5k swamp paste for the cheapest (and slowest lol) 25k construction exp you can get."

I think Oda is great at PVP but in a team setting it's very questionable\n- Faux's team next because they seemed weakest out of the remaining 3 teams. People have said blood fury is going to be huge so maybe they will come in first.\n- I place Dino's team above SoloMission because I think they have the best gear now?

For example, if they have a 4t weapon and you have a 5t weapon, they can get 2 hits to your 1 very easily. By dancing out/back under, it's hard to land spells or consistently melee, while their weapon of choice is hidden so you can't land prayers very easily.\n\nSeeds still move you when frozen, so the strategy is often to seed into freeze back to neutralize the advantage.",

IDK why tf donator was running around with VW like that tbh. Their rng got them the most important stuff, massive pvp weapons and dps beyond the other teams. That's exactly what they want as the more skilled pvpers. ACB/arma gear, etc doesn't seem remotely comparable to 5 of the best ancient weapons and multiple VW.\n\nExpected Solo's team to have a massive gear advantage since they seemed easily the strongest pvm team and got the early corrupted gear. But from the video, they went 6x drop rate on zenytes (kinda insane to be that dry), and under drop rate on ACBs, leaving them almost unable to use Dragon bolts. Looks like they went dry on the heavy ballista too since you'd expect them to be better than rcbs and they should have hit drop rate during zenytes.

Poor dude couldn\u2019t catch a break. They sunk a bunch of hours into their voidwaker too.

            "Because the final would take 10 hours otherwise.",
            "The better question is why are you forced to take 3 restores for a 1 brew fight.",
            "B0aty is just like that as a person (kinda always has been) but also being so successful has allowed him to be like that... even in Gielinor games he doesn't care if he gets out because he doesn't need to win the prize pool... he has made BANK from streaming OSRS and is set for life both irl and in-game (he could take donations any-time and make billions in a single stream but hes humble and barely likes taking GP from others).",

            "Skiddler flames everyone, i wish he was on a team with more on par shit talkers honestly. Would have been amazing to hear him and skillspecs for example on the same team. Instead all he really had was ditter to back and forth with, who isnt entertaining whatsoever.",
            "Fully agree",
            "I just mean his whole view on the week was always going to geared to the pvm side and avoid pvp as he has little knowledge of it. \n\nWhich played out kinda bad from a content point of view as all the best moments were during some form of pvp. Which is a pity as i love Skiddler and there aint many clips of him lol\n\nPVM/Ironman knowledge is pretty common these days i don't think he brought anything unique to the week in that regard really.",
            "very possible, either way Faux made the overall choice to approach it that way the same way Boaty built his meme team.",
            "Playing dmm doesn't make you good at pvp. I've watched the guys pvp streams prior to this week and yesterday and he is bad. Definitly up there as one of the worst in the competition.",
            "A flaw off the seeding system more then their team being pvpers. I don't see how any fans of Faux can even deny they played a very safe game plan. \n\nLowest deaths due to playing it safe and high total level the only area they came up bad on was kills again due to playing it safe. They had the lowest kill participation out of any team by far. \n\nThe Burgers were yeeting themselves into every situation possible and making great moments doing it.",
            "Yeah those clips were funny af tbh. The 1 tick deafen was incredible lmfao. More so just that they basically didn't show up to any breaches, and then the one time they did they got logged by the burgers and just sat there for 3 hours lmao.",
            "Honestly that's what a lot of people thought. It wasn't worded very well in Solo's announcement video\n\nThe rules were 1 death= pneck, death #4 is a food, death #8 is another food\n\nThe video left it open for interpretation where what you said was completely viable. But no everyone with 4 deaths lost a food",
            "Ohh I see. The teams got to decide their order freely, they don't have to go in the order of the draft pick. Some of them mentioned on stream what order they're going in, but afaik it hasn't been compiled anywhere for all to see.",
            "Charged/Uncharged changes the shape. If you open the picture in fullscreen you can clearly see that both Oda and Gunschilli have uncharged rings. Skiddler from the Faux KKonas also has an uncharged ring in the picture, which they talked about on stream but he ended up charging it before the time ran out.   \n  \nI wouldn't be surprised if Oda's team is allowed to charge it if they have the recoils in the bank though.",
            "Dino made a single comment after winning a fight and he \"caused the most drama\" lmao. The Oda stans are ridiculous. The drama is from Oda's community.",

            "Additionally, the day prior to their last zammy trip, Oda and Rhyss had like 4-5 dex scrolls in a row while chasing 1 final augury scroll lol that was depressing to watch",

            "I don't think he lost the maul, but it would be easy to reattain anyway. Maul handle was in the emblem shop assuming they still had points, and lol gargoyles. He probably just opted to camp vls instead and go for outlast over ko potential.",

            "Nah, rhys was way too aggressive and took pointless fights. He didn't quite understand until chili/victim explained to him that the top objective was to play as passive as possible and farm pvp weapons, not pk mystic sets that aren't going to help in the finals. Solo/eliop played it perfectly with solo making the macro/positioning calls and eliop making the micro calls in fights. Rhys just caught up thinking people were criticizing his micro decisions (who to focus, etc), but his macro decisions were just really poor.",
            "Rhys was kind of terrible on the calls\n\nMaybe he\u2019s used to a different dynamic like you said but what he brought to this event was not what was needed. He didn\u2019t handle the situations and team dynamics well",
            "The problem with Rhys is his ego. He makes excuses that don\u2019t make sense because his ego is too massive",

            "Between rounds, yes, but not between fights\n\nIf Rhys and Dino are 1v1 first, and Rhys wins with 1 food left, Rhys then has to face the next competitor on Dino's team with only 1 food in his inventory\n\nIf Rhys's team beats every player on Dino's team in this manner, then they get a full restock of food for the next round",

            "Ye, I know that Rhyss grinded out a master wand for Oda's team as an example. But you know that wasn't my quote, I was simply agreeing with the sentiment\n\nPlus, that isn't even what was said lol. Obviously there are people that \"would\" do it; it is, after all, no different than a pvm grind in terms of a time-investment. It's just guaranteed after X hours instead of being an rng grind; and it simply isn't exciting content unlike pvming. However, what was said is that nobody from Dino's team \"wanted\" to do it. And, tbf, with 3 zuriel staves, they kind of didn't need to.",
            "Idk enough about donator tbh. Just felt from the clip i watched, there were atleast 2 better choices to be using it on that team for content and he looked helpless. If Ray is donator, then this guy was one of the last guys in the event I'd have been excited to see use a VW.\n\nIdc that he lost it. But he was also really cut up about losing it, so i don't see who wins in this situation besides westham.",
            "Imo with the format, ko weapons might be the game changer, without restocking between fights, lets \"a good pvper\" take out several people without burning through his own food, without ko weapons you'll always burn your own food too, even if you outlast",

            "You are seeded based on a variety of factors (most kills, least deaths, etc). Total level was one of those factors. Your seed placement determines if you get a bye (skip first fight) and who you go against bracket wise",

            "I literally saw his livestream. He checked multiple times so i know it's charged",
            "Seems a little biased when Dino in front of his entire stream goes \"That's a streamsnipe. I just got stream sniped\" on his first death\n\nOda was actually quite wholesome whenever Westham/Dino found and attacked him early in wildy. Meanwhile the same situation from Dino's POV and the hate and frustration was quite blatant\n\nThen there is the constant whining when people come in his chat & troll him with the \"you're stream sniping\". Not just from Team Oda, but others aswell\n\nDino is a whiner (might be on purpose to milk it, at this point I truely have no clue) so it really just makes for a massive invite to all toxic trolls to come in and annoy him\n\nHe really just crawls into the role of victim way too blatantly to the point where even his own subs are calling him out for, ESPECIALLY if after that one day full of drama he brings it up again and again & tries to bait Oda ingame\n\nDino was the biggest letdown of the tournament. He constantly feeds into the drama and at times blatantly looks for it, to then immediately play the victim for the next hour\n\nLoved watching all content creators and wish more of them streamed, but Dino is a little rat",
            "Dino called oda a bitch after artio ragged oda and he had to leave??? How is that not flaming lmao. Dino was literally talking shit from the heart and trying to act like he hadnt been holding it in. And oda only hit him once or twice in wild like that, dino AND westham somehow always hit oda but go on",
            "Yeah will probably come down to how victim does as Rhys/Oda are both more then capable of taking out the other teams main pkers. \n\nHe is a bit of a dark horse and did really at getting escapes off all week.",
            "Yeah the problem is the couple of players looking for fights were people like Westham and Oda. Half the field ain't winning that fight in 10 attempts let alone 1 so why risk it?\u00a0",
            "And faux team is not stacked lol. They have 0 good spec weapons on thwir whole team and it will cost them the final.",
            "If you watched both streams its quite obvious. F.e. the last boneyard breach Solomissions team practically free farmed the full breach while Dino got a vls and zuriel in 5 min and went Pking after.\n\nSame with the GE breach, solos team literally full farmed for 20min while Dino farmed for 5min and was caught up in the giant multi battle afterwards.",
            "Rhys/Westham/Oda all perfectly know what they are doing. Saying someone is the best by far is just straight up silly\n\nThey are all on the same level, the rest is RNG",
            "Yeah the different dynamic being a clan full of replaceable mystics and black dhide rag sets and survivability not being a primary concern outside of obvious clumping for barrage/chins. Rhys is use to throwing bodies at other clans not playing conservatively with limited resources etc",
            "idk man, I kinda get why he is upset, when he calls solo mission like 10 times and 2 minutes later Oda still hasnt attacked the right enemy. Rhys is just super competitive and wants to win this, so he gets upset when things go wrong.\n\nThat breach wasnt even that bad apart from that situation, but odas followers convinced him with donation-texts, that rhys has just a big ego, cant admit when hes wrong and that oda should do shotcalling... which is not really helping anyone other than the other teams. That Odablock did not listen to calls at all and ran around in circles for 10mins after regearing was never the topic for his followers.\n\nI watched oda the most and generally sympathize with him a lot more than with other streamers, but when he went off against rhys, it was just cringe really. It was odas fault and he fully blamed rhys for it, just because his chat told him so. I watched it live and 90% of odas chat called him cringe. It was just the donos that stirred up the shit further and further.",
            "I laughed so hard. Torvesta's dry replies were so fucking funny, Skill Specs and Torv interactions are peak OSRS content for sure.",
            "Is there a clip of this? I missed it, was watching Solo\u2019s team all week",
            "Just watch skillspecs daily run down on youtube. Great content, well made.",
            "I know I'm just poking fun at the failed kill on gunschilli that turned into a successful blood shard drop :)",
            "You're right about that, my mind glossed over them only having 1 brew.",
            "That is a good point, I don't think that would switch the others to be better in an outlast fight but makes ko potential even worse. In their benefit entity hider is not allowed so they will sometimes get fang specs off prayer when dd under.",
            "The dps calcs dont take into account the defensive bonuses from the cox prayers either, which are pretty decent. though osrs has pretty much always been about the offense not defense. \n\nI think them all having blood furys + being the only team kitted out with fangs is gunna be interesting.",
            "They ran a lot of raids but bleh luck lol",
            "A lot of people watching got to see exciting content they otherwise wouldn't have seen? Just because you're a hater doesn't mean everyone is. I haven't had so much fun watching OSRS streams in years as I did watching the burgers this week. That includes Donator btw, who was the one that farmed the Voidwaker in the first place for the majority of it.\n\nEDIT: Also Skill Specs used it earlier but he went to sleep and gave it to Donator to continue the content.",
            "You could choose to swap an angler for a karambwan. Pip and coxie among others opted for this for one slot",
            "I have seen a Bowfa shred through that 300 damage as well to be fair. But yeah spec damage absolutely will matter.",
            "Interesting. Is there rules for the entire finale somewhere? Really curious how it works between rounds, do you go back to your first round inventory setup after advancing or will everyone have predetermined supplies for the next rounds?",
            "Also makes no sense they punished deaths (less food), rather than reward kills (more food for example). This way any non pkers were scared to fight.",
            "JCB with the 3t DH bomb on Westham to avenge his fallen comrades and win the bracket. THE GOAT",
            "Also players like oda can use the restore doses for redemption procs, which is easier than you might expect with all the recoil damage\n\nhttps://m.twitch.tv/clip/ConsiderateBoldCoffeeANELE-KMbj-M7GCgLoh5R1",
            "Well my original point was about entertainment value not desire to win everyone else approached it in a way that ultimately produced good content. \n\nFaux's team took a pragmatic approach they ended up being quite boring in the end. And i feel a big reason for that was just his lack of PVP knowledge.",
            "Fang Specs are budget VLS specs, especially when food is super limited.",
            "I did watch quite a bit of both POV, and I have the opposite feeling. Don't really think you can make a claim that confidently when you don't have any data on it.\n\n  \nI get that it's a pretty non-important topic here, I hope this doesn't reflect how you view important things.",
            "True. But KO potential aside, players like Oda as an example who can 1T a VLS from either staff or crossbow have an advantage here to me. All it takes is one fat VLS spec and it\u2019ll be hard to recover. Especially with how much DPS you lose healing with hard food.",
            "Can't be THAT many with how many hours Westham/Dino wasted pking\n\nHate that I have to call it wasted because its supposed to be a game mode about pking. But if Donator didn't troll his max set, all of it really was for nothing\n\nI do want to see the stats of this tournament though! How many raids did each team do etc, see how the RNG played out",
            "What are you even on about? I'm saying the guy was not a good pvper compared to others on the roster, that's not hate, it's just honesty. I don't even know what your first sentence is addressing.\n\nI appreciate he earned it. But as we both alluded to, skilly with a VW is better content. Boaty is also a pretty solid pvper, so presumably a kill or two would have been cool to see. All i saw (and I imagine from youtube this is what most people saw) from Ray was him dying frequently, and losing a VW, which upset him greatly. Just seemed he wasn't the right guy for the weapon. But again, this is from someone who didn't watch any of donator's streams and have no idea if he can actually pk when he plays against easier opponents.",
            "oh, i didnt realize that was part of the food rules. nice",
            "Solomission has a video on YouTube covering the rules if ya wanna check that out",
            "Oh yeah.. Feel like people mainly were looking forward to watching all these teams square up at breaches\n\nBut making deaths cost food not only made 2 teams ignore the breach throughout, but also really effected the way breaches were played. Team Solo/Dino/oda eventually just accepted that they just had to afk farm it while not fighting\n\nOnly the Burgers threw a wrench in those plans by actively ragging Team Oda for 3 breaches in a row lmfao\n\nThis week was hype, but it could have been so much better if some teams werent locked up in CG for half or raids for 90% of it. PVP part was completely missing",
            "Oddly fitting name, that 0 hit on mage pray lmfao.",
            "It's not even budget, low ko chance but people are camping tank gear.  Most of these fights are gonna come down to attrition and fang actually out dps vls.\n\nBeing able to 10 tile against rcbs is also great.  I think if they play this out right it's a toss up between them and nuggets.",
            "In the end of the day it is a pvp tournament and the better pvpers will do very well.  Oda is absurdly good and his team might win the whole thing. I don't think they did great in the first phase, with the Nuggets and Kkonas building up advantages but they have 2 of the best pvpers of all time. \n\nIt's also osrs, it's very possible someone just splashes 20 times and gets wrecked even if they are good. It's very possible that every venge jcw does the opponent hits max and he the others they miss.  Skill specs is likely going to die without doing much but maybe his dharocks kos someone. People act like the best pvpers always win but I guarantee you Oda, Rhys, Dino, Westham, Ditter, etc. have all died 100s of times to people a lot worse than them. I've seen people do 50 damage with over 400 earned and people do 400 damage with 100 earned.  Tomorrow will be a lot of fun but it won't crown a pvp champion.",
            "~45 or so as Raikesy and Muts were grinding solo and then they did a few together last two days. (53 CoX KC between them but 5ish were together so double counted).\n\nDino was at toa more than CoX but we don\u2019t talk about what happened there.",
            "Awesome, thank you so much! Been stuck at work with 4 12s in a row so haven\u2019t been able to follow the tourney much but going to try and stay awake to catch the finale",
            "VLS specs would beat out fang specs I believe, but the fang wacks would be better.",
            "I forgot about the range distance. If they can utilize that it can be huger! Like fighting bots in LMS",
            "Vls specs will be about 10-15% more dps than fang spec.  non specs will likely be similar amount worse than fang. If the only melee hits are specs, vls will win and has more ko potential.  On the other hand if fights get drawn out and the vls doesn't ko, fang will out dps the vls around the 8th hit likely.",
            "Normally melee is the least used in NH but with them having the blood furys will be interesting to see if they are going to try to camp fang as much as possible."

            "My brother and I did a very similar trip to the end of the wilderness circa 2005. And I smithed us both sets of bronze armor and when we made it to the fence together it was so exciting. \n\nWalked back into varrock like champions chanting \n\u201cWe are the first noobs to make it to the end of the fence!\u201d\n\nBut agreed that it was such a magical time to play.",
            "Great story. Thanks for sharing. I'm not sure how to feel about your name and flair, though",
            "Reminds me of the time my friend took me to Taverly Dungeon. I'd been to Taverly before but had no idea there was such a huge dungeon underneath it. \n\nAs a kid it really seemed like such a dangerous place, especially running past the dragons etc. The Black Demons blew my mind and he told me that you could get a Dragon Med helm from them. \n\nOne weekend I slept over his house and we pulled an all-nighter safespotting the Black Demons with a Rune Halberd. The kills took so long you'd log out from inactivity if you didn't move the camera lol.",
            "It was a different time wasn\u2019t it\u2026.I remember when a friend in our RS group got 70 wcing and we all were just thinking of how much money we were going to be bringing in that we started making plans like \u201cI\u2019m going to buy all of Varrock!\u201d",
            "An incredibly long trip I\u2019ll never forget was trudging from Varrock east bank to the barrows with my buddy Ramsey. \n\nNo digsite pendant, no lumberyard tele, no ring of the elements, no fairy ring, no kharyll house portal, hell - we were too dumb to take the boat shortcut, or to have access to the resistance hideout shortcut. \n\nJust, walking, with no stamina potions, waiting at the gate next to the homie Ulizius for 100 run before we braved the swamp, praying to Jagex for a Guthans Warspear. \n\nBack when my total level was closer to my age than the current year, simpler days.",
            "My best friend when I was 9 was a kid I met in class. At that age, he had 99 magic and a fire cape. He actually still plays and maxed an iron man account a few years ago. Meanwhile, 9-year-old me was out there telling people my password and getting scammed.",
            "My home life was shit so when I was 11 years old I would wake up at like 7 am on a sat/sun and go to the nearby university and spend the entire day there playing rsc until 8pm when they closed. It was a computer lab for pre-med students so the computers were high end and they never kicked me out; probably assumed I was someone's child. True story.",
            "I used to do expeditions into Morytania and Karamja and never came back alive.",
            "My first day playing I was 8, and I thought the guy I was talking to to  start Ernest the chicken was a real player",
            "I still think about how there use to be no in game map. That shit was on a second tab or browser and it got me killed once or twice lol",
            "Does anyone remember when we use to be able to left lick the run icon, and rest to gain run energy faster?? Or am I not remembering correctly?",
            "Thanks for the heartfelt story Mr. HorsesMakeMePiss.",
            "I went to wildy before the ditch/home teleport were a thing and I remember getting stuck to the far east over varrock for literally a week. I would go south (by looking at my wilderness level go down) but I was so far east I would hit a wall. I didn\u2019t figure out that I needed to go west to end up over varrock for like 15 hours. I was probably like 10 years old and remember being terrified.",
            "Me and my bro did the same, Lumby to Eagles peak. We even stopped for 'rest' with fires, brought food supplies and all \ud83d\ude02\n\nTook all of 30 minutes",
            "Back in my day we didn't have home teleport\n\n\nWe'd have to brave the perilous trip back to lumbridge by foot\n\n\nSome say a black knight lurks around there even!",
            "What a story!!",
            "I used to think the random mysterious box (that constantly stacks up to 25) was an infinite money hack lol",
            "Now when i think about it it would have been nice when the whole map was hidden and you had to explore it to unlock the map just like in horizon or other games. That would make the exploration part even better and make the new players curious. Maybe the could bring this even now out",
            "Back in the OG days, when your screen was 720p, and the sky was black, RuneScape felt so big.\nNow I play on a 42\" screen and can see Falador from the top of Lumbridge castle \ud83d\ude02",
            "My neighborhood friends and I used to fantasize about what all we would buy if we had $1M. I distinctly remember sitting on his side yard steps outside having the conversation.",
            "Were you guys members during this journey? I don\u2019t think f2p can even access charter ships, they only go to members areas besides port sarim.",
            "I used to hate paying the goblins between Al Kharid and Lumbridge. Some times I couldn\u2019t even afford to pay the fee and would have to walk around \ud83d\ude02 Then I found out doing a quest will get you free passage and I thought that was the best thing ever. Also only played f2p back in 2004, couldnt afford membership. Good times!",
            "Reminds me of the time when I got stuck in the karamja volcano and died to the skeletons there because I didn\u2019t see the rope.",
            "When I first played my irl friend though I\u2019d we logged in super late after dark and joined empty servers we would find tons of gold in chests turns out he was wrong lol, we ended up in the wild and died losing full steel gear",
            "omg this is so cute i love it",
            "I did a similar prep week for a camping trip into the wild. I remember training my fire making level because I didn't want to be caught by a pker while trying to light a fire.",
            "Kids these days have it easy. They don't even remember the dark times of Falador massacre. People fucking died during it",
            "Getting stuck in an area with no way out was a legitimate worry",
            "You probably remember your first teleport. I remember finally getting the magic level and spending most my money on a law rune and telling my cousin bye, I\u2019m heading west. I made it to the members gate at Fally then teled back.",
            "Draynor Manor pre home teleport was a nightmare. My friend had to come show me how to get out. And then we both died to a tree. Good times.",
            "But do you remember sleeping bags?",
            "Wow.\n\nWhenever I use home tele, I think \u201cback in my day, we had to DIE to get to Lumby\u201d\n\nTo think that was only two years max is nuts.",
            "I swear I started playing in like 2007 but I also remember home teleport being introduced, so I guess it was more like 05/06",
            "My first account got stuck in draynor manor. I remember trying to get out and the chairs following scared me so I just logged out and made a new account, while making a mental note to never go there again.",
            "The day they came out with the home teleport happened coincidentally at the same time that I was lost and unable to find the exit to the under ground pass. I had been stuck in there forever it seemed and was so glad of the escape",
            "I heard 9 years old and was assuming some super old shit. I was playing when I was 14 back when everything was 2d sprites and dragon slayer just came out. Home tele didn't come out until after I had quit and come back because I went to play EQ then WoW.",
            "Was it really as early as 2006? I very distinctly\u00a0remember pre home teleport. I thought home tele was like, 2008 or 2009.",
            "My brain honestly still sees it as a \u201cnew feature\u201d. Human time perception is fucked up.",
            "I remember when monkey madness first came out if you didn\u2019t bring a teleport the only way to leave was south of the graveyard (which I learned about maybe 2 years ago) or by dying",
            "Right, my immediate thought was \"ha, dude really dated himself with the home tele, he's still a kid\" but no, no not really. That was still nearly 20 years ago at this point.",
            "I thought it came out way after that lol. I remember getting stuck in draynor manor for like 3 days before I found the back door. I could\u2019ve used a home tele then",
            "Bra. I feel old",
            "Same",
            "Rs classic and staking/PKing evolving has been a crazy ride",
            "Huh, I thought they introduced the home teleport during rs2 beta when people were getting stuck in random places",
            "I remember getting lost and just starting a new account because I had no idea where I was haha",
            "For real? My head was questioning this story just because I remember home teleport coming out at what felt like, a much later date.",
            "It came out in 06............I've been playing a lot longer then I thought.........\u00a0",
            "I remember it being a controversial addition. And I remember getting eaten by bugs because I thought I'd be safe in the swamp caves. I had a tele, after all!",
            "This changes everything",
            "What the fuck",
            "What is this \"horse\"? Is that some sort of high level slayer creature?",
            "Omg I'm still traumatized by that swamp destroying all my food before I could make it to barrows.\n\nI was blown away when I made a Barrows teleport in my POH not long ago. Seems like such a cheap work around.",
            "I remember this",
            "This was like right before RS3 I think",
            "What about the jester outside of falador you could rest at!",
            "That was later in rs2 in like 2010 or something. Polypore staff era",
            "They had to be members yeah",
            "I once got stuck in the general store, upstairs a few days into playing when I was a kid. I didn't know you could rotate the camera.\n\nThe next day my friend told me to just home teleport. I'd forgotten it was a thing in my panic. \n\nI figured out the camera rotation a week later.",
            "There was a house near the ranging guild where if you went up a ladder and then went down it from the other side it placed your character behind a table unable to access the ladder.  If you got tricked into going there you had to have a friend come with teleport runes to let you escape",
            "Not middle school me making an entire new account because I thought my account was bugged. Never went back for a very long time haha.",
            "The first time I quit runescape was because I got lost in lumbridge swamp",
            "My mate was in fally castle before the white knights got updated, logged in and he was behind something like boxed in. Had to be manual moved by a mod to get out",
            "Still remember it like it was last night, I was exploring karamja, no idea where I was, poisoned by a tribesman trying to find my way home safely. As is tradition, I had my entire cashstack on me and slowly died to the poison. Never did find my out way",
            "I remember my first home teleport too. \n\nI was only past the bridge and killing goblins before I discovered an icon in my mage book that wasn\u2019t greyed out. \n\nI was so amazed by the character animation. I remember telling my older brother about it and he said \u201cyeah it takes you back to lumbridge\u201d and I was like oh wow this place is called lumbridge? \n\nDamn. I\u2019m so high, I had to reminisce this out in words for some reason.",
            "Ernest the chicken fucked me up so bad",
            "That's one of my earliest runescape memories. I randomly found draynor manor. And back then it was packed. There were like 20 people doing the quest. The basement puzzle with the levers was impossible for us dumb school children.\n\n\nWell, it was indeed horrible as I couldn't figure that out nor could I find the exit. And the cherry on top? I didn't actually pick up the quest. I just entered the building and started randomly interacting with the environment. All the quest items are there, you just won't progress.",
            "Oh ya",
            "Yeah September '06",
            "I heard its like a mythical unicorn",
            "Yes it was. Now that u jog my memory, this was some of the best times for me in Runescape. Everything didn't seem so much of a \" I gotta spend 3 days grinding this to get this\" back then it was more of a , \" what am I going to do today\" something different than yesterday, and just as fun\"",
            "Resting came out way before RS3, resting was 2009 and RS3 was 2013.",
            "I remember this !!",
            "The polypore staff blew my mind. It cost less than 1m to hit 40's against other players in the safe clan wars portal lol. Simpler times",
            "Resting was more than 2 years before Polypore staff lol. It would honestly be a good addition to OSRS especially the Musicians part, that was dope. They'd have to nerf it a bit probably",
            "God I wish I could go back to being a stupid kid. Everything was so exciting to discover.",
            "I remember going down the cave in Karamja and not being able to get out. I took me the help of a friend to know where the rope was and how to get out",
            "I played for nearly two years before I knew you could rotate the camera.  Man did I feel dumb when I figured that out.",
            "One time after an up date, I don't know how it happened but I got stuck between the building and a wall/fence at the house that is directly west of the edge vill bank. There was no home teleport and I had nothing on me to get out. I wrote support and it took a week. Then I logged in and I was back in lumby. This was pre home teleport.  There is also now a break in that fence that you can get out.",
            "first time I quit was back when random events weren't optional and I ignored the frogs. got sent to there swamp cave and couldn't figure out how to leave.",
            "It was humbling realizing that my account is old enough to buy alcohol legally.",
            "I still play osrs that way haha\n\nATM I'm just farming cause Elden Ring DLC. But usually I randomly pinball between stuff. My playtime is ridiculously long for how little progress I've actually made lmfao",
            "He was 17",
            "This but the gravedigger / coffin one, spent days trying to figure it out and finally just quit for awhile.",
            "Never in my life have I feared a chicken so much",
            "I didn't need to think about this lol. We getting old boys.",
            "Not sure whether to downvote you for reminding me\u2026 or upvote in solidarity",

            "Bruh, is this on tablet or phone?\n\nI can\u2019t phatom doing this on a phone",
            "I fucking suck at this game",

            "Teach me your ways\u2026 farthest I\u2019ve made it is wave 57 and it was by sheer luck.",
            "Sick",
            "nah, absolute god gamer, I'm always amazed by how good some people are on mobile. I'm curious, are you able 1t flick on mobile? Were you using a tablet or a phone and do you use a stylus? Besides tile markers, which I heard are coming to mobile soon, what would be the best improvement to end game content like inferno?",
            "Big gz. I would have picked up those runes on the ground and died lol",
            "Thats pretty sick man gz",
            "You make it look so easy! On mobile too! Good stuff!",
            "Pssshhh. You basically have two mouses (thumbs). This isn't impressive. /s",
            "silly question, but aren't uim supposed to have like a looting bag or something for all their stuff?",
            "Mans doing it on mobile, meanwhile I'm too chicken shit to do it period lmao",
            "Man that's crazy. I would hook up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard for that.",
            "Right at the start, drop a rune 4 tiles from the edge, run for 3 ticks (6 tiles) and drop, then run for 5 ticks (10 tiles), then 3 ticks again.",
            "The new mobile UI they had in beta allows you to mark tiles. Hopefully that will come out soon and you won't have to drop runes to achieve the same result",
            "I did it during the double mage wave because you can just stand around with protect mage active and take your time. I did my log out break before that wave. I also dropped them one tile into the arena from where this guy did so that I could actually click the tile without worrying about picking up the rune.",
            "Lowkey I did zuk on the toilet",
            "iPhone 13 Pro Max my guy",
            "It's actually easier on good phones because there's less travel time and more precise screen taps. Tablets tend to be pretty bulky and awkward to hold, a midsized phone you can hold in both hands easily and use both thumbs comfortablely",
            "It's a huge learning curve, but you can do it if you put your mind and effort into it \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Learn alternating your prayers, it is the biggest game changer",
            "Yeah, someone told to practice prayer switches with the Colosseum before inferno.",
            "Not OP but also inferno mobile cape:\n\nYou can 1t flick on mobile and it\u2019s arguably easier because your other hand is free to do anything else in the middle (like moving if needed) without having to move the cursor like you would have to do on pc. \n\nI personally don\u2019t use a stylus because I like holding my phone and prefer the use of my thumbs but I know some people use stylus. \n\nHonestly, I personally am not pining for any plug-ins for PvM. Like if they come, I may use them, but I mostly think a lot of the common PvM plug ins are really unnecessary and are more of a crutch. No issue if people enjoy them, play however you want. It\u2019s your game, tailor it to your experience. But for me, nothing I look at on stream and think \u201cI need that\u201d. Mostly just feels like clutter. \n\nThe plug-ins I do wish we had were more QoL based things like !kc and chat commands etc rather than the ones for making PvM easier. But they\u2019ll be here soon so no sweat. Damage tracker for PvP would be very nice too. Same for self-entity hider so you can see your opponent\u2019s gear switch when they dd you. You\u2019re kind of trolling in fights if you don\u2019t have those and your opponent does. But it\u2019s not a humongous difference atm.\n\nAlso like you said, tile markers will be here soon, and while they\u2019re not something I care much about, I know that is highly sought after.\n\nOP may have differing opinions though of course.",
            "Yes learning 1 tick flicking and alternating prayers was the biggest thing that helped with inferno (mostly did lazy flicking though). And like the other guy said, it is very easy to alternate while targeting other npcs or moving around.",
            "I have eight fingers, and two mouses",
            "Inferno is a safe death, so my stuff was at hespori",
            "Sorry if this is dumb question,\u00a0 but do you mean start of the wave or start of inferno attempt?",
            "Been waiting on this update myself to finish up getting my cape. Spent a week of sending inferno and got to Zuk 6 times, 2 of the times getting to healers. Sure I could have probably sent another 5-10 attempts and got my cape, however I didn't utilize dropping anything to mark the safe tiles so I had to use a decent amount of mental effort to pay attention to the safe tiles. I am willing to bet having them clearly marked with tile markers will make the final fight significantly easier. We will see though!",
            "Taking a shit and taking care of shit.\n\nLove it\n\nHow numb were your legs though ?",
            "LOL amazing",
            "Well, i have a shit phone but guess i\u2019m fucked then",
            ">more precise screen taps\n\nBro how small are your hands?\n\nI have an XL sized Pixel phone and my thumb can hit anywhere in like 1/4 of the screen. I genuinely have no idea how people do anything other than afk skilling without a stylus, tablet, or both.",
            "Why? Is Coliseum easier than Inferno?",
            "Thanks for the well thought out reply! \nWow, I never thought prayer flicking on mobile could be easier in any way than on a computer, but the fact that you can move or do other actions as you'rw flicking is pretty huge. \nI get what you mean about plugins making the game too cluttery, but I just can't imagine doing something like ToA without knowing your true tile, puzzle solves or just item tags, I much prefer how the inventory looks without them, but I'd rather have them on than mess up my switchea during akkha. I guess the plugins aren't essential per se, but they do make the game way way easier. I'm sure most osrs players would agree with me that achievements on mobile are much more impressive than a  computer. Wish I was good enough to do raids or other endgame content on mobile when I'm not home.",
            "ahhh thanks, so basically you have hespori as a bank lol:D gz btw",
            "Start of wave 69 ^^^^",
            "Not bad considering I logged out at zuk earlier that day hahaha",
            "Way less punishing because it is much shorter so you can get more practice in. For example: fire cape took me 4 attempts which made me rage quit for months, then I finally got it and fully learned CG days later. Can just get way more practice in",
            "I haven\u2019t tried either yet, but I\u2019m going to go for the colosseum and practice when I do.",
            "Colosseum is a lot more punishing and the death fees add up, but you do make a ton of money back if you get good drops leading up to SOL.\n\nIt took me about 2.5-3 weeks and around 180 deaths before I got my first quiver. I just got my first infernal cape today and it took 5 days and around 20 runs. \n\nThe colosseum definitely made learning the inferno a lot easier because I was used to prayer flicking. Inferno is just a slog and honestly the waves aren\u2019t that hard. Colosseum can destroy you pretty quick and often when you get bad A/B spawns in later waves",
            "Thank you. Congratulations again\u00a0",
