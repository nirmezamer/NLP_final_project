        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am a 2nd year student in romania studying industrial engineering and robotics. Sorry for my bad english I am very angry. \n\nI am the student \u201eleader\u201c at my professor laboratory of industry 4.0 stuff. So we do plc programming, cfd/fem simulations, 3d printing, iiot, you know the usual. \n\nI am a programmer at heart. I love my python, my react, c++, c#, openCV, Unity and I am really really bad at mechanical engineering. Such is life. \n\nFor the last 6 months I have been begging my professor to get an industrial robot. Since you know, I love programming and a cobot is peak mechanical engineer that can be programmed to do ANYTHING. Also we are a robotics university, at the department of \u201erobotics and production systems\u201c. \n\nYesterday I got a phone call from *insert big robot company here* saying yes we will give a real industrial robot because you are a lab in a univerisity. And my professor was like no thanks. After I begged every company to give us one 4 free.\n\nHere is why I am furious. I have done a lot for that lab. Most of the projects there are even funded by me to some extent because election year and public money from the uni is impossible to get. I bought 14kg of 3d filament in total, vibrations sensors, microcontrollers, my old pc were all used for projects in the lab\n\nAnd he can\u2018t even say yes to the single thing I have been asking for??????\n\nI will probably remain at his lab and forget this all happened because I am gold fish but I am personally hurt even tho I shouldn\u2018t be.  \n\nAlso most of the projects he wanted to start have gone terrible wrong and usually only my projects go smoothly for some reason. I would like to detail in the comments later what projects he wanted to do. \n\nSuggestions on what should I do? \nIf I leave the lab, the team will literally not exist anymore. And next year I have a class with him sooo yeah",

Does the city your university is in have any licensed specialists who could maintain it or will the university need to hire and train someone whose sole responsibility is to maintain it? If so, how much will that training cost? And what is the expected salary range of the employee hired for the job? Where does the funding for this come from?\n\nFurthermore, what is the university going to do with such a device? An argument could be made if you were a Ph.D student who literally needed one to further their research, but typically universities don't go for big, shiny, and expensive to maintain toys just because some random fuck off undergrad thinks they'd be cool and fun, especially when that toy requires specialized (and costly!) installation and maintenance.\n\nFinally, it doesn't matter if your professors' projects go well or not, what matters is that they continue to get funding (grants); the university can ignore a LOT of bad behavior as long as the money keeps coming in. _Especially_ if they're tenure. You, on the other hand, appear to be a particularly entitled undergraduate who doesn't understand how universities are run.",

I would like to detail in the comments later what projects he wanted to do. \n\nThis comes off as very arrogant. Your professor presumably has years of research experience as he runs a lab. Does he have publications? Sometimes research goes wrong. I know I've wasted months chasing dead ends in the lab. You are a 2nd year undergraduate student, do you think it's possible your projects go smoothly because they are generally a little simpler and less novel, and not that you're simply better than everyone else?\n\nIf you really want an arm your best bet is to write a research proposal for a project that would require it and that you stand a chance of achieving. You'll need to determine required space, safety precautions, maintenance and upkeep costs, etc. because if you want to convince your professor to make a significant investment in equipment you need to actually have a use for it and already know everything that is involved in the ask.

Yes we are an industrial Engineering faculty and there are 400 students currently enrolled in industrial robots course and we get a total of one semester where we can touch a robot.

We saw linear guides, gearboxes, ball screws etc only in pictures. Like I get it, maybe they are expensive, and seeing them might not make a difference.

You can't change the past, but you can definitely shape what comes next.\n\nA little about what happened to me:  \nI did Electrical Engineering and managed to graduate with honors after nearly failing in my first semester. In fact, during that first semester, I got a C+ in a math course. It wasn't technically a fail, but it felt like one to me. My GPA for that semester was below 3.4. This really got me down for a few days, but then I took it as a wake-up call. I recalculated the best possible GPA I could achieve if I got straight As for the rest of my degree\u2014it was 3.93. Motivated by this, I completely changed my approach.\n\nHow did I turn things around? It wasn't easy, but I pushed myself to extremes. I reconsidered my study habits, breaking down everything into hourly tasks and daily to-do lists. I planned each week meticulously and stuck to my schedule rigorously. Using Google Calendar to manage my tasks was incredibly helpful. I made sure to focus in class, although initially, I could only digest about 50% of what was taught and retain just 20% when I reviewed my notes. To improve this, I used a technique called spaced repetition, which helped immensely.\n\nI made it a habit to spend all my hours after class in the library; this became my new normal after a month of practice. I started assignments early instead of waiting until the deadline. Collaborative problem-solving sessions with friends proved invaluable\u2014never underestimate the power of studying with peers. When it came to exam preparation, I practiced explaining concepts on a whiteboard, a technique known as 'learning by teaching,' which is an effective way to solidify your understanding.\n\nI didn\u2019t pull all-nighters during exams; instead, I made sure to get more sleep than usual. Remember, these changes won't show immediate results\u2014it might take a month or more to see progress, but gradually, if you genuinely enjoy engineering, you'll start to appreciate this routine.\n\nMaybe try exploring same sub-space of habit changes that I did. They worked for me, and while everyone's different, they might just work for you too.\n\nBtw, I graduated with 3.97, as apparently they don't count my first year grade in official transcript. Your failure will be a lil bump in the road down the line, but to make it so, you must change your current approach.\n\nYou got this ;)",

Don't lose hope! \n\nYou have a few options right now:\n\nTough it out: Stick with your current degree and current university. Keep studying and retake the classes you need. You are already familiar with the material, so it will be easier the second time around. Make study groups and do your homework with other students if you can. That's the only way I got through some of my toughest classes.\n\nChange your major: What are you studying right now? A lot of degrees have overlapping courses. Is there a major that does not require the courses you just failed? I.e. At my school, we would have a lot of students that switched from CS to software engineering to avoid taking discrete math. Similarly, I decided not to major in ME after failing statics.\n\nTransfer universities: This is what I did. If you are worried about your GPA taking a hit, this might be a good option for you. When my transfer credits came in from my old university, they just showed up as pass/fail and didn't influence my GPA at the new university! The GPA I graduated with was only from the classes I took at my new university, so I didn't have the failed classes wrecking my GPA. I graduated with a 3.8/4 GPA despite failing 3 classes at my old university!\n\nIf you are worried about taking an extra year from failing classes, you can take summer classes to make up for the lost time.\n\nYou got this!!",

Now everything is perfect, I just graduated and have a job in local research company.\n\nWhat I suggest for you is to try to learn stuff everyday, even it is not related to your courses. It will create a habit of learning for sure.

Maybe one of OP\u2019s classmates knows the answer to a problem and can explain it in a way that makes more sense to them than what the professor or textbook says. \n\nAlso seconding on it\u2019s the best way to make friends, some of my favorite college memories were midnight snack runs during a long study session before a big exam.",

I would talk to your advisors to see if there is anyway they can help you to take finance related tech electives then if you want to stay within engineering. You'll still have to do the other engineering classes but I would imagine it's more enjoyable for you then if you have some classes you like then",
            "They probably pay but ye fair point. It's honestly the main reason I don't tell my mom my grades even if I'm doing well, unnecessary stress and expectations. She'll know when I'm finished or least she'll see the final results.",
            "Do u think I should change my major? And quit engineering",
            "Exactly. My mom doesn\u2019t pay for my school and my freshman year she tried to get on my ass about bad grades. Shut that down very quickly and now we have a very chill telationship in regards to school and I\u2019m just truthful about how things are going. She doesn\u2019t care because it is not her business",
            "Truly, it's more a question for you than for me. \n\nFinancial analysis is absolutely something you can do with engineering and a background in engineering can only ever help you is my POV, especially if maybe financial analysis doesnt pan out as you desire. However, it's a lot to ask of someone. That's why my view is to stay if you can but try to tailor your course load into the financial areas if possible.",
            "This is the way. Dealt with this early on when I first went to college out of high school. Life happened, some relationships no longer exist, eventually went back on my own accord and finished my bio degree, and am now finishing my engineering degree. Never felt more free. College should be experienced with as much freedom as possible imo"

Generally speaking for classes you hate, put some nice studying music that you enjoy that might help.  For studying do problems and try and understand the concepts (DON\u2019T MEMORIZE).  My fluids professor once said that one way to study is by trying and explain the concepts to a rubber duck.  Literally do that, get an object and explain the concept as if you\u2019re the professor.  I do this all the time and it helps a lot",

            "This is a pro of having ADHD combined with the knowledge/experience on disciplining yourself properly.\n\nOnce you get that fucking shit going you will not stop, because you realize that once you stop you lose momentum. \n\nI personally really hated building physics (architecture/building engineering), where I had to calculate heat / moisture / acoustics / light / air quality etc etc. The subject itself wasn't too bad (I loved studying/designing for acoustics and sun light for example) but man, ESPECIALLY certain thermodynamics and fluid dynamics broke my brain. It was so awful because it was boring to me. Long ass equations that I had to study just to calculate if some damn moisture would end up on the interior of a certain house in certain conditions.\n\nAnyway, what ended up happening is that I managed to lock myself into the work that I had to do. It can become really stimulating at some point, at least for me. This only happens if I'm able to narrow down my attention to only do the stuff that I gotta do.\n\nFew things I want to share with OP:\n- (if you have ADHD) Sip on something like an AA / sportsdrink while you're studying. Supply your brain slightly with some glucose, it helps focus (don't over do it, you don't want to spike your insulin too much)\n- Take no\u00f6rtropics. Here are a few you could look into: piracetam / alpha-GPC / noopept / rhodiola rosea / L-Theanine (basically tea) / L-Tyrosine (basically protein shake)\n- between every hour of studying (or whatever interval you prefer), stop what you do and just stare at a single point in your room for a few minutes. This will feel like you're being unproductive, but you're actually being WAY more productive than you could possibly be. Your brain will start to re-activate the neurons that you forced to activate when you were learning. (This also happens when you sleep!! If you're capable of studying late into the night, going to bed right after helps with retaining info! Same as taking a nap)\n- contrary to sleeping, getting yourself in a situation where your adrenaline spikes also makes you better at retaining information that you learned right before this adrenaline spike. So going for a workout / consciously placing yourself in a stressfull situation (like a cold shower) right after studying could help aswel.\n- (if you have ADHD) test your knowledge on the subject you're studying over and over. I personally cant study if I cant test myself. Testing myself is where my motivation comes from, because it tells me Im on the right track or it tells me I need to change things up drastically. Without the ability to test myself i tend to get very lost",
            "lol that might do it. Pretty risky though. Getting caught cheating on a Chemistry exam is a sure fire way to hate the subject forever",
            "I\u2019m confused as hell about this, I\u2019m about 2/3 through gen chem 1 rn (summer class) and so far it has been incredibly easy, although I have a pretty good professor\n\nI\u2019ve always heard calc 2 was the biggest weeding out class",
            "He has nothing to lose, like asking a girls number",
            "Yeah lmao. My biggest achievements in my life have been acing calc 1/2/3 after failing terribly at it.\n\nI went to a very low-education-level highschool and never had actual mathematics before I went to study building engineering at age 21. That has been probably the most humbling experience in my entire plife. Students 3-4 years younger than me thinking it's easy calculate multivariable equations using partial derivatives and multiple integrals etc etc. Meanwhile I've actually never properly understood how to fucking divide something by itself lmao. I had no concept of rules in the mathematical language. This was a pain beyond words to describe.\n\nI managed to get it done tho. If I can, OP definitely can"
