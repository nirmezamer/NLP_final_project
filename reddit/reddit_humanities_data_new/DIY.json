There's nothing above it, it's parallel to the ceiling joists, and has a 2x4 on each side. It should be easy to shore that up in the attic to avoid sag before you get the saws-all blade stuck taking out the wall. \n\nIf you're really worried about it you could put 2x4s or 4x4s on each side of the opening with a 4x6 on top as a sort of archway, visual break between the living room and the next room. Then sheetrock over it. Structurally sound, a small visual break between rooms, and you can put a little bookshelf above the opening there for added space, or a place for cats to knock stuff off of.

If it is, you could put up cross-beam under the ceiling supported by both sides, then sheetrock the beam in so it looks good. I did this in my house with 2ea 2X16 x 10' sandwiched together with plywood in the middle for padding to beef it out to normal wall width - this was when I removed the wall between the kitchen and the dinning room.

In the same way that a hollow core door is less durable than a solid core door.  The double stud adds a lot of rigidity to the end. Anywhere that a wall doesn\u2019t have a dead end, it\u2019s instead connected to the adjacent wall somehow, and that\u2019s where the rigidity usually comes from.",

Much more common to see a double, but depending on the decade the house was built in, it was at one time very common to do a solid [4-stud corner](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/115157/is-a-california-corner-as-strong-as-3-or-4-stud-corner). That could very easily lead to someone putting a triple at the end of a wing wall, either out of habit from framing corners or because they already had a triple knocked together and just threw it in.\n\nBut double or triple, the point is still just to stiffen up that outside edge that has no lateral support. The only time I know of where multiple full-length studs are required for structural support is when you have concentrated/point loads like a column or girder beam above them. In that case, you have to provide an equally beefy load path all the way to the ground, so you usually get 1 stud per ply of the girder, or the whole footprint of the column being filled with studs.",

However, they burrow through it like mad which I'm guessing is what you're interested in. \n\nThough polystyrene is not typically used to make bottles for holding strong acids, it is stable enough to be used and the worms would not likely be averse to chewing through. The first hole through the bottle would let out a small amount of acid and take out victim #1, but then atmospheric pressure would hold it the rest of the acid in. Once there were two holes at different heights, the acid would begin flowing freely and create a steaming smoking pile of worm goo. \n\nCashApp me $50 and I'll do a YouTube video for you.

I would urge you to look beyond that (and the difference in width which would be a deal breaker for me unless you\u2019re changing the orientation by 90 degrees which brings its own issues).\n\nYou also should consider thickness, sound transmission, scratch resistance, warranty and wear/yellowing/aging from UV etc.  then make a decision.  If you\u2019re going to live with this decision for a while, you should consider the long term implications (other flooring will also change over time but ANY difference with an attempted perfect match will be very noticeable).",

We had a similar decision to make at my house and went with something completely different and have no regrets. \n\nI did put a photo of my kitchen into some app to give it the look of my living room floor, and I think I\u2019m glad I chose to keep the contrast between living room and kitchen.\n\nHowever, it will look nice either way!",

            "Its close enough it you make a transition break of some kind like a threshold.",
            "Looks close enough, place it 90 degrees rotated to the original floor so light bounces off of it differently but it will be attributed to the rotation and not the wood color.",
            "Not sure if this has been said or not, but you could also run the planks perpendicular to your current floor as well, which I think would further hide any slight difference in color. Ultimately I think it\u2019s so close you should go for it.",

Still worth it to rip out the linoleum and plywood, hammer down or pry out any staples and install the new floor directly on the subfloor to make that transition as flat as possible.  I used a circular saw with the blade set to a little over 1/4\u201d deep to trim through the plywood and barely touch the subfloor, then used a pry bar to pull it up in sections.",

They did the living room first, but when they went to extend into the kitchen they realized that they had the exact same wood, but with a matte finish instead of glossy.

If you are trying to match half a room with the other half of a room, for me, it would drive me nuts, and I would rather just redo the whole thing. But that\u2019s just me.

Something not mentioned here yet is that you can hide minor differences buy installing a transition strip (probably have to anyway) and run the new flooring perpendicular. I\u2019ve done this before with worse match and the eyes are way more forgiving with the break and the change in direction.",
            "If you want it to look \"close enough\" to fool people into thinking it's the same flooring, you're probably always going to be dissatisfied with it.  I personally have no problem with it being apparent that two adjacent floors are different as long as they don't clash.  The color tone match is great.  One thing you may want to double check before committing and kicking yourself forever is to stand back at a distance and make sure they have a similar shine from a glare, because that could make it stand out.  If that's important to you.  Some of those types of flooring have a real \"wood grain texture\" to their shine and that would be distracting if the old floor was sanded super smooth.",

Even just a little bit of water on laminate will start to bubble it if you don't clean it up fairly quickly. Lots of stuff spills on the floor, so you have to worry about staining too. I'd go with tiles in the kitchen. Easy to take care of and won't turn into a disaster. ALSO, you may find you need to roll out your fridge or oven, and you have to be EXTRA EXTRA carefull with wood or laminate flooring to not scratch it. \n\ntldr: Go with tile instead. WAY easier to maintain.",

            "I have been around design for 42 years and I can confidently tell you that when you try to get close but aren\u2019t an exact match it looks worse and it\u2019s more noticeably an error then if you do something intentionally slightly different. Or greatly different. It doesn\u2019t matter as long as you don\u2019t try to get really close but can\u2019t quite get there.",

I also think that's why OP went perpendicular on one view and parallel with the other.\n\nI'd probably go tile in the kitchen and go opposite of your cabinets and countertops for some contrast.  But I also don't think I'd want white cabinets again so I'd caution that too.  Maybe like a light wood cabinet with a darker tile.",

Tiles won't get damaged by water the way many wood-based flooring would. Imo, it's also easier to clean.",

I'd love some nice white cabinets. \n\nMy recommendation that wouldn't match is bamboo floors. They won't screw up with water. And they will get wet lol. Or really, tile.

            "Only in very old construction. All modern construction, both new and remodel, in the US uses an engineered wood subfloor of some sort. Usually this is plywood (or OSB, if you're cheap).\n\nNobody uses direct plank flooring any more. Besides the cost of the wood (thicker hardwood is more expensive), the cost to install (more complicated install, you definitely can't do anything prefinished because of height imperfections), there's also the issue of wood movement. Wood shrinks and expands naturally with changes in the seasons, and planks/boards are not dimensionally stable. So you will end up with gaps, which is more of an issue when those gaps open directly into the floor void.\n\nAlmost all hardwood flooring these days is an engineered product as well, basically high quality plywood with a finished/different top. And they're all installed over a subfloor. Even when doing remodel it is common to install a plywood subfloor over any existing boards, before installing the finish floor.\n\nSo direction basically doesn't matter. Plus there are a lot of slab foundation houses in US, where there aren't even any joists it's just concrete.",
            "I forget the brand name of the flooring we purchased for the upstairs in our woodworking shop, it is also water resistant, lifetime warranty, easy as heck to install.  Our dogs are getting older and we wanted something that could withstand accidents.",
            "Can confirm, even when a repair is done correctly, in the process you'll discover three other things that need attention, some of which can be put off for another day and some that immefiately go to the top of the list",

            "Yeah I think pic two shows a quarter inch difference.  \n\nI grew up with laminate.  It was very durable and easy to manage.  But now that I am older I would save for some form of hardwood or really nice bamboo (some bamboo does not \"hide\" things very well).  You might even be able to source it off of craigslist from one of the wood dealers in the area.",
            "Second the tile idea! As a young man, I helped my grandfather rip out the wood floor their kitchen and replace it with tile... the wood all around the sink area was soft and spongy from years and years of slow water damage. Tile is the way to go: water proof, and classy as heck! But yeah, dark grout; no one wants to see the dirt that accumulates in the cracks.",
            "I'd rather dings than a cracked tile from a dropped pan",
            "The \"easier to clean\" is not the selling point; it's a detail. The \"you've got a major leak on the fridge water tubing\" or \"the plumbing under the sink is failing\" will cause much more damage to wood-based flooring than mopping the floor with a lot of water and thus require more money to repair.",

Following from the basic idea, there's a lot of room to improve it, probably a number of flaws too. I basically thought it up on a train.
