            "please GOD let us see Sarada do SOMETHING. can\u2019t believe we\u2019re waiting months at a time to see everyone except for Boruto fail to do anything important",
            "Poor Sarada and Himawari; get a couple panels of being cool and competent only to having to be bailed out by Boruto once again. Why ever have the focus leave Boruto if he\u2019s going to be the only one who actually accomplishes anything?",
            "I swear almost everytime Konahamaru does something cool, he gets owned. It's like he's not allowed to actually shine. \n\nThat being said that new guard type rasegan was a pleasant surprise.",
            "A brief history of Sarada's journey getting her ass saved in the entire series:\n\n1.Ch11 - Sarada lets her guard down and gets snuck by a fodder mujina bandit to which Boruto has to bail her out. No sharingan active\n\n2.Chapter 58 \u2013 Sarada lets her guard down and gets tricked by a shadow clone from Kawaki and needs to get bailed out by Boruto. No sharingan active\n\n3.Chapter 79 - Like 5 people tell Sarada that Kawaki is crazy, so Sarada decides to go face to face against Kawaki without her sharingan on which causes her to get caught of guard and Boruto has to save her ass.\n\n4.TBVCh1 - Code pulls up on her - Boruto has to bail her out (i'll let it go because it introduces Boruto back but did the first showing of Sarada after the TS have to be her needing to be saved???).\n\n5. TBVCH2 \u2013 Let\u2019s her guard down and gets caught off guard by a fodder claw grime \u2013 needs to be saved by some fodder shinobi.\n\n6. TBV Ch11 - Boruto has to save her ass against Hidari.\n\nTruly peak writing - Kishi has certainly improved his pen for female characters. \n\nSeriously though, her overall introduction over the TS has been terrible.\n\nLike every time Sarada appears in battle, instead of fleshing her out by herself, he's gotta press the summon Boruto button every single time. I can't believe this is the same man that wrote the Uchiha in the original series. \n\nBtw, I'm not even expecting her to win against Hidari but I expect her to do something and actually showcase her growth from the 3 year TS (exclusing the MS). This battle should have been what Mitsuki vs Boruto was - Boruto was clearly outclassing Mitsuki, but Mitsuki was able to showcase what he had learned over the TS so that we as the readers can gauge where he is at.\n\nThe fact that Sarada was snuck kinda helps with how I originally felt about Sarada this issue. That being said, Sarada knows how the claws work - she's seen Hidari, code and the claw grimes travel between claws, yet she positions herself next to one??? Like where is her brain??? Where is her spatial awareness??? The truth is they need Sarada to be an idiot so that Boruto can play the knight in shinning armour as per usual. I also love the way that most of the fandom are defending Sarada getting snuck but clown on Kawaki when he got snuck by Mitsuki like wtf???\n\nAt this point I just hope Boruto take Sarada away from the village and sends her ass to Orochimaru for training. Give her an upgraded version of Sasuke's timeskip training with Orochimaru's up to date knowledge. Might as well slap on a curse mark too cause this girl clearly did nothing but whine at Shikamaru about Boruto's innocence for 3 years.",
            "Himawari getting random power that more than Naruto is beyond me. Lol",
            "Ikemoto's drawing is so bland, speed lines used for background not artistic. They should find a better mangaka. or Masashi should take over his drawing.",
            "Naruto had to learn rasengan as fundamentals on top of train with Killer Bee in order to master biju bomb\n\nand now Himawari with baby Kurama no less able to master bijuu bomb out of the gate lol",
            "Himawari\u2018s power-up still feels shoehorned in for me. \n\nYes, she isn\u2019t dominating Jura but the whole speech about her surpassing previous Jinchuuriki, transcending the jinchuuriki, effortlessly healing Inojin (who was likely dead at this point), wielding Kurama\u2018s powers more or less from the get go and more is nonsense to me. \n\nPeople trying to compare her growth to Minato\u2018s (WA KCM) is even more nonsense. Hima apparently trained for 3 years, yet we got one training sequence of her and Ino-Shika-Cho plus some ominous statement, and people try to tell me her growth is natural?\n\nI like Hima as a character. It\u2019s her power trajectory that reeks of plot-induced power-up to keep up with Boruto (Another can of worms). \n\nKawaki getting clowned on yet again makes me dislike this scene even more.",
            "Himwari randomly able to control her hair, use biju bomb, and heal people. She has no cloak but can put up a fight somehow.",
            "Naruto could only heal others besides himself after receiving the power from the sage of 6 paths so why can himi just all of a sudden heal completely punctured torso.",
            "I have read fanfics with better writing. No wonder why the sales look the way they do.",
            "Was this chapter censored last minute or something? The who sequence on pg 32 and 33 were her shirt rips from an attack that doesn't leave any marks seems wrong...",
            "This chapter is a patriarchal W",
            "I\u2019m sorry, but the repeating formula of-\n\nEnemy shows up in leaf village>Everyone freaks out and struggles against enemy>Boruto suddenly shows up>Easily handles enemy that everyone else is struggling with>Boruto Leaves>Enemy shows up in leaf village\n\nIs starting to get old.",
            "It\u2019s weird how these kids are handing these threats but we still have a whole lot of veteran Shinobi. Where is SAKURA, KAKASHI, ROCK LEE? Are they dead wtf is the old cast",
            "Its funny the boruto sub is parading this chapter as peak while this sub is actually critiquing the chapter for its weak points.",
            "No fucking way can Himawari instantly control a biju bomb...\n\nThis bullshit is truly off the chats",
            "So every character that\u2019s not Boruto is worthless got it. At this point the only reason Sarada is still alive is to be a kitchen maid like Hinata to Naruto.",
            "The art is still bland backgrounds and speed lines \ud83d\ude10 bro is addicted to making the backgrounds just lines despite having a literal month between chapters unlike other mangakas",
            "How long has it been since (in the real world) Sarada unlocked her Mangekyo Sharingan? And we *still* don't know what it's ability is. If Mitsuki and Himawari can have cool moments (even if the power scaling is whack) while still being beaten, why can't Sarada? Even Konohamaru got to show off a new ability this chapter.",
            "I like how Treesuke can just spit fire without doing shit.",
            "This is so ass bro.",
            "Hima uses a Bijuu Bomb within 10 panels of inheriting Kurama. This shit is so ass \ud83e\udd22",
            "TBV started off hype, but it's quickly falling off super hard. Nobody knows why sakura, Lee, kakashi, tsunade, shino, Kiba, temari, kankuro, any other village/kage, etc aren't helping. Like where are they?????\n\nPlus the power creep is insane. I can understand boruto getting all his stuff in the time skip bc although it's all strong stuff, it isn't anything impossible. Mainly flying raijin, kenjutsu, and a new rasengan. \n\nKishimoto HAS to show the side cast doing things next chapter or I feel like the manga is just cooked and done for. Himawari, sarada, the new ino-shika-cho, mirai, sumerei/nue, or ffs even just showing what other villages and kage are thinking or what's happening with naruto and hinata?",
            "I wish Himwari's power was tied to her character development in some way. Like she's a prodigy that devoted the time skip to mastering the rasengan in several variations. And her motivation for mastering was because it's a connection to her father. All this could have been shown or just mentioned during the training scene a few chapters ago.",
            "Sorry Kodachi. perhaps i treated you too harshly\n\never since Kishimoto or whoever take over the writing. this manga has turn into total dogshit. both story and pacing. Kodachi writing isn't very good but his pacing is way better and i enjoyed it more than the current. writing.\n\nand of course he treated Sarada way better than the current writer. Now Sarada reduced to damsel in distress and being a trophy wife for the main character so he can looks cool and awesome. yeah of course there's instance during Kodachi part where Sarada gets into trouble and need saving but it's like once from what i can remember. TBV is only 11 chapters and Sarada alread been saved 3 times!. Did the writer foget she had mangekeyo? even if you make excuses she didn't want to go blind and will only use the MS when it absolutely neceessar, isn't this a best time to use it with her tied down to a tree and all his friends are knocked out? not even Sakura was this bad\n\nDelta constantly disrespect Kawaki is the only good thing in the last couple of chapters",
            "[It's lowkey offensive how often this series does this where they try to say the asspull on screen to lampshade it being an asspull.](https://i.imgur.com/PrdBT3I.png)\n\nLast month Kurama did the same thing where he [stared directly at the audience saying the explanation for Kurama being with Himawari doesn't matter.](https://i.imgur.com/l0Zwhs0.png)",
            "What a shitshow of a story",
            "I like how Himawari is basically what Kushina could\u2019ve been if she and Kurama worked together \n\nLike not I\u2019m convinced the only reason she has long hair was to simulate the nine tails look and do tailed beast bombs lol. I dig it, more similar to baryon mode than Kurama chakra mode. Which I prefer\n\nNice to see Konohamaru show off something new and at least successfully block an attack. I also like that Hidari can\u2019t use the chidori perfectly cause he doesn\u2019t have a sharingan lol\n\nLast note: still waiting on an explanation on why Sarada and Sumire are immune to the rewriting. Seems like Sumire sensed something from Hidari that tipped her off to Sarada being his target. Gah I gotta know what\u2019s going on there",
            "I dont think these villains are gonna be too interesting for final series villains they are kinda bland and generic. it just seems like boruto doesn't know what its doing with all its pieces. Tbh at this point even zetsu and Kaguya are more compelling story wise.",
            "Love this as a new Dragon Ball Super chapter. As a new Naruto chapter? Not so much.",
            "This chapter was very meh to me.\u00a0\n\n* Maybe I\u2019ve been spoiled by other series, but the Inoji resurrection was very\u2026. mundane. Anyone could have guessed that they wouldn\u2019t have the guts to keep him dead.\u00a0\n\n* Nine-tail Himi artstyle is cool. Interested to see how it develops.\u00a0\n\n* My biggest gripe right now is that Boruto is the ONLY person capable of ANYTHING. It makes for a boring manga because like Ten Tails said, everyone seems so incompetent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNew Sadara powers? No. New team dynamics? No. New entry of past cast? No. Let\u2019s not write god-tier villains ya can\u2019t make it entertaining.\u00a0\n\n* At least the cool frogs are back lol.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI enjoyed the chapters preceding this, but I hope we see SOMEONE outside of Boruto do something other than get folded like a lawn chair.\u00a0\n\n*Edit: My hope is that they\u2019re setting up Boruto to be overwhelmed by the responsibility of everything. He has be in constant surveillance of Konoha, literally had to be in 2 places at, and the whole world is against him (I think? Because no one outside of Konoha has even breathed lmao). Him battling the weight of this burden would be great, but it\u2019d be a Berserk manga at that point.",
            "LET HIMAWARI AND SARADA FIGHT OMG \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "I liked everything I\u2019ve seen in tbv so far but my biggest critique is the lack of side charcters where og konoha 11 , metal  , kakashi the cast feels so small I\u2019ve said it time and time again boruto does not work on a monthly schedule for these reasons either the pacing is going to feel to slow or too fast .  There so much lore and depth to charcters that need to be fleshed out where monthly dosent work for this type of series . Prime exsample code invaded konoha they don\u2019t show none of the other side cast not evacuating civilans fighting off claw grimes nothing I\u2019m not asking for a chapter even a couple of panels is more then enough. I know theyll fix that in the anime adding scenes  but how do you expect manga sales to ever be good when thats a glaring issue .",
            "Konohamru took a W since he actually reacted to Hidari teleport chidori attack, and protected himself with a new rasengan wind barrier. I consider that a W since he would\u2019ve had a doughnut through his chest from that chidori. Sarada getting folded makes sense to me because Hidari explained it\u2019s hard to use chidori, because he has the tunnel vision problems just like Kakashi did before obito gave him his eye.\n\nSarada exploiting that weakness while using her sharigan to counter attack, seems like it\u2019s a plot point kishimoto is setting up to make Hidari want to steal her eyes to perfect chidori. I kinda wish kawaki saved Hima instead of them flexing Boruto speed, but i think Kawaki is probably gonna fight Jura again. If he uses his V2 state with his horn, he probably puts up a better fight with delta helping shooting her light beams that counter juubi healing abilities.",
            "The tree people are more interesting than the otsuki but I wish they were all copies of important characters instead of random people",
            "why does boruto even run from cringawaki when boruto low diffs everyone crigawaki struggles with",
            "The reason hima is so naturally attuned with the 9 tails is because it wasn\u2019t sealed in her, it\u2019s literally been growing back inside of her. She and kurama are more together than naruto and kurama ever could be.",
            "Himawari did well and still has lots of room to grow.\u00a0",
            "I need the random red shirt who hasn't yet been murdered to survive this, lol",
            "I started playing the Storm Connection game. Same game as the others but it feels more fluid. \n\nBut all the Boruto Characters look so weird and have weird as hell color palettes. They have like two or three colors to them, and very simple designs to them.",
            "for a sub that allegedly hates/dislikes boruto y\u2019all sure do be keeping tabs on it lol\u2026",
            "I knew they were going to butcher her character when they had Sasuke spend all his time with Boruto when there's no one else to train her how to use the sharingan.",
            "That's what I have been saying. Boruto is the only character allowed to do anything. Instead of making Boruto cool by being better than other characters, they just make everyone else useless.",
            "I've been waiting for months to finally see konoha 12 actually show up and do something instead of Ino just communicating and Shikamaru sitting on a chair.\n\n\nLike\u00a0 Moegi could have developed before she became a tree. The excuse that it's monthly doesn't work as AoT is monthly yet has good pacing heck versus is biweekly having roughly same pages yet development is pretty solid\u00a0",
            "She destroyed the dude's arm with a Chidori before he regenerated and only lost cuz the dude's the second strongest in the group and can create his own escape/summon routes for sneak attacks. \n\nNo one's giving Sumire and Konohamaru the same heat for being blindsided. \n\nLike let's be honest with ourselves, Boruto lost against all four of them together. He came in with the save for one, but would we have called it good writing if Sasuke was able to beat full power Orochimaru in the Forest of Death.",
            "Kinda makes sense why they can't do anything against characters far above them in strength tho",
            "I can give Himawari a pass on that front since she at least got a decent fight scene and it was her first real fight (though having instant perfect control over her new powers is questionable). Sarada getting clowned over and over and over again is just inexcusable.",
            "i mean do you realize what are they fighting?...",
            "You gotta remember he\u2019s along with team 10 are  going to have to face moegi shinju . Do I expect konohamru to win he\u2019ll no but I would be highly disappointed if he Dident debut a monkey sage mode . I\u2019ll say this since  kishi arrived he been giving konohamru way more screen time",
            "And to think he was supposed to be the new Kakashi.",
            "Considering Kishimoto is supposed to have only recently been involved in this series, and his writing for Sarada in the Scarlet Spring was actually pretty good... I blame the new writer. Ikemoto is also to blame for making questionable design choices for the women. Kishimoto doesn't have the best track record but he never sexualised 12 year olds. I can see Kishimoto's influence on more recent chapters in regards to plot, but I don't blame him for the characters as that has been consistent throughout. I'm guessing most supervising original creators don't get much say anyway.\n\n\nEdit: edited to change the blame to the new writer as well",
            "He created a new claw behind her while they was questioning his connection to Sasuke, that\u2019s why the sneak attack worked.",
            "It also cheapens every \"death\" that will come in the future. \"Just heal'em!\"",
            "Something something unlimited Kyuubi power",
            "Yeah, somehow Himawari was just given a powerup that took Naruto years to attain and she surpassed him in using that power despite this being a chibi Kurama and Naruto being not only the Jinchuriki of the nine tails, but also the Jinchuriki of every bijuu, making him the pseudo Jubbi Jinchuriki",
            "Not to mention getting Naruto\u2019s ninja Jesus power to heal others instantly and having better healing \ud83d\ude02",
            "Kishi just being kishi doing bad decisions. With hima he should have taken time making her follow hyuga path gaining tenseigen.",
            "It\u2019s not that surprising when you consider who her parents are. She\u2019s half Hyuga, and now she\u2019s technically a Jinchuuriki. She doesn\u2019t have \u201cHalf\u201d of Kurama\u2019s Chakra; she might have all of it.",
            "Nothing about this is shoehorned it's just a new discovering of a character that was born in being a biju literally explained in the chapter.. she just lacks the necessary power and experience to face against current threat",
            "Exactly what I was thinking. Naruto needed training from Killer Bee to learn how to make bijuu bombs. Himawari can somehow just do it on her own instantly on her first transformation without even knowing what a bijuu is.\n\nAnd by Jura\u2019s own words, her super-healing is even better than any other normal jinchuriki\u2019s, literally Ten-Tails Madara/Six Paths level healing.",
            "All that with a baby Kurama",
            "Kurama did say that she had a better bond with him than all the previous jinchuuriki(likely due to her being a Hamura and Hagoromo's son's reincarnation's descendent(that's a lot of apostrophes)), maybe it's similar to the avatar state where she can gain the knowledge/he can pass on techniques or knowledge to make it easier for her to learn idk\n\nJust throwing out ideas and that one makes sense to me I guess, and tbf she was getting her ass kicked when the guy started to actually try",
            "It feels weird as heck to me too. But I\u2019m feeling like Kiddy Kurama is flowing his chakra through her hair as a medium. She looks shocked about the Bijuu bomb forming while her hair formed the 9-Tails form",
            "Seems like it was supposed to be a micro bijuudama destroying her left side, but they censored everything by keeping all the flesh on her",

Your either hating or not understanding the power gap between the new gen and these threats",
            "You're forgetting when Isshiki showed up for Kawaki in the anime he bodied all of them minus Kakashi\ud83d\ude02. The olds casts minus Naruto and Sasuke both who are out of commission btw are basically non existent.",
            "The Boruto sub is delusional",
            "Echo chambers do be like that. They are just kids after all, easy to tell by the way they are writing.",
            "You say that but I've seen plenty of valid criticism over there too. It's just not framing everything as complete dogshit or complaining about how Hima can do Bijuu Bombs and have better healing/regeneration than Naruto even though it's already explained as her having a better connection to Kurama in part *because* of Naruto.",
            "Just an theory of mine It can make sense. I am willing to believe her and Kurama spiritually fused when in that mode as she gained newfound high tier fighting prowess out of the blue and much greater raw power (enough to send jura back who is an humanoid tentails with six path markings and a small portion of code's karma mark chakra which has isshiki's chakra and shibai as claw marks was one of  his many abilities) during the fight (and likely his battle iq and knowledge and his powers including the bijuu bomb transferred to himawari which puts her somewhere above kcm2 war naruto)\n\nIt's gonna be better explained in the anime thats for sure. But the power jump is huge, but likely because of what kurama said her potential with her is far greater than naruto and kushina and she ain't even a jinchuriki but something alike. I think its her version of BAYRON MODE without the risks rather than KN0 AND KCM,but its different than the actual modes naruto progressed through since kurama now is more fond of humans and she isn't an jinchuriki, but is far weaker than bm naruto (as for now) since adult naruto base is mid kage and he had full kurama with 100% of his chakra post-war and as I said already she isn't an jinchuriki but something totally different as she has no seal. Her being a better pair with kurama than both her grandma and father  is just the way kishimoto wanted it since hes the headwriter (thank the overpowered cyborgs that kishimoto introduced to the narutoverse post-isshiki death), and she is destined to surpass prime naruto and sasuke at some point in tbv as the powerscaling reaches DBZ. Daemon was astonished by her presence alone despite him in the same league as jigen and stomping no limiters code, so she will be an powerhouse aside boruto and kawaki. Her 10% air palm alone as an adult would probably obliterate someone like juubidara in mere seconds. It's just the way it is.\n\nKurama is controlling her. For all we know kushina could probably have been the same if kurama hatred for humans wasn't there. but himawari has more potential being born with the chakra of hamura and hagaromo, being child of an reincarnation and having an dojutsu that could potentially become an tenesigan if she has relations to otsutsuki clan, and kurama is actually working with her now. Case closed?",
            "man at least hiatus has the excuse of being a side character but Sarada should be a super important character for the series.",
            "Remember that movie where they made Hinata a super strong Otsutski princess just for her to become a baby factory?\n\nSarada better start taking notes.",
            "Were you expecting the main antagonists who were introduced only 7 chapters ago to lose to the main characters that were struggling against their inferior copies?\n\nSarada cut off his arm, and Hidari tagged her, Konohamaru, Sumire, and a random chunin/jonin,  it's weird to only put the blame on her for that when Hidari just sucker punched them.",

Compared to the growth shown by Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, and even the side characters at the beginning of Shippuden, these last few chapters have been like if Shippuden started with Naruto entering Sage Mode and fighting half the Akatsuki himself.\n\nI don\u2019t care if we see Sarada start an attack and be stopped before it can land (a la Sasuke\u2019s Kirin at the beginning of Shippuden), or see her pull out a new move and it just doesn\u2019t really phase the enemy. I just think it\u2019s dumb to even initiate a timeskip (and have us wait months in between the initial series ending and the new series beginning) if you\u2019re not going to take advantage of what it means for narrative & character growth.",

Would have made sense with the omnipotence since team Taka genuinely care for Sasuke and wouldn't care that he's a criminal, and the researcher in Orochimaru would hear her out. He could have turned her into a beast like Sasuke did in his TS.",

            "Sarada didn't do nothing dude. She obviously trained but that doesn't mean she would be able to compete at all with Jura or Hidari. Boruto's training was simply unique as he was personally trained by the most skilled shinobi alive out of absolute necessity. Not to mention he easily has the highest latent potential in the franchise as well as being an Otsutsuki.",
            "I agree with your point about Kodachi but it's more of the set-up that he was giving her that interested me. The only big moment he gave her was the the Boro fight but he did give her small moments in the earlier arcs which Kishimoto doesn't even do. \n\nThe set-up I was appreciating was the potential set up for Orochimaru being her master. Ninja cards are really important in this series with Boruto wanting the SSS rated Sasuke card which implied his bond with Sasuke. Kawaki trades his card with Boruto to get the Naruto SSS Ninja card (Ironically, the card Kawaki trades with Boruto is the Minato card which must have been done on purpose since Boruto now knows FTG)\n\nSarada in CH15 of the manga pulled the Orochimaru SSS Ninja card which implied to me that they were gonna set him up for her. Mitsuki in CH38 then states that Orochimaru has been studying the Byakugou seal which further pushed that idea. If anyone is gonna help find a new level to the seal, it's gonna be the genius researcher that wants to find the mysteries of the universe.\n\nKishimoto then takes over the writing and Sarada just stopped getting those kinds of hints between her and Orochi. Her ship bait writing drastically raised tho.\n\nIt's a shame since Orochimaru would have been a really good teacher to get her to the desired level in a reasonable way that makes sense.",

Boruto? For showing concern for his sister and old teammates and trying to keep them safe? Sumire: who's done edgy things like....keep her friends mentally stable. Or Konohmaru...who's trying to keep his loved ones safe. Or Chocho..what's edgy about Chocho?\n\nAnd how would you expect a Sharingan to be under Boruto's eye?

Even Sasuke had to have SOME form of practice to get used to his Rinnegan abilities. \n\nBashing on Himawari learning how to use Kurama's power when she has Kurama's cooperation from the literal getgo and is already stated to have the strongest affinity with Kurama only means that Himawari WILL be able to perform feats fast. \n\nWhining about Naruto having to train with Bee means nothing when the training with Bee was about the Bijuu Bomb that Naruto failed at without cooperation.",

Seeing as Sarada isn't walking the darker path like Sasuke did, I think they will avoid the comparison.\n\n\nThough they might not do the three masters, three students at all this time. It seems to be all Boruto and Kawaki focused. I thought at the end of Naruto the two brothers fight cycle was supposed to be broken but I guess not. I'm kind of disappointed on what they chose to focus on for Boruto. I saw some image floating around when it first started of Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki in the future, Sarada had mangekyo.

He's obsessed with someone who he was brainwashed to forget was his best friend but instead the person who tried to kill both of his teammates and was the first people in the village to accept him. The fight allowed him to actually dive deep into those feelings and make the first step into breaking the Omnipotence.\n\nEida has always been more than a simp. She desires connections and the only people who can do for her were people who either only see her as a plot device, Boruto who she dismissed until he showed her maturity by proving he wasn't going to blame her for what happened, Kawaki's treatment of her getting red-pilled, and leading her and Mitsuki to even have the conversation.\n\nTeam 10's focus was tied to Himawari because they're the ninjas who she's been to closest too outside of her family. Inojin and Himawari have a whole friendship explored in the anime and nvoels that was carried over to later and it's asinine to argue she wouldn't be motivated by her loss and fracturing of her family she wants to help.\n\nHimawari's focus and fight with Jura didn't bring Boruto involved directly until after he saw she was hurt. The only thing you could argue is that Boruto's actions caused Jura to even awaken, but that was Code who caused that because of the Claw Grimes he experiemented with.\n\nSarada ran into the fight because they were told two intruders were breaking into the village and one of them had her dad's chakra signature. \n\nSarada doesn't even know she has the MS yes. Kakashi didn't know he had it for years. And Sarada being saved after being blindsided by an attack she had no idea her opponent could do is not an anti-feat, why would Boruto not go out of his way to help his teammate and sister. It'd b emore out of character it he didn't. \n\nAnd it's not about making Boruto look great. Boruto has every reason to get involved in these fights:\n\n* The Claw Grimes and Code were responsible for incapacitating Sasuke\n* Code went after the Leaf to draw him out after leaving the village alone for 2 to 3 years.\n* Why would Boruto not get invovlved in stopping the threat responsible for imprisoning Sasuke and stopping it from claiming more victims?\n* The Shinju tried to murder him and feed him to become the means to end the world.\n* Mitsuki's being mindwiped into thinking they're enemies \n* His sister's under attack by the main villain he was also forced to run against.\n* Hidari was able to block his Uzihiko and now take on his old mentor, best friend, and classmate\n\nIf you're saying the character with the most incentive to be an active character is bad because he's being active in the story because the side characters have to also feel the same threat so they can grow stronger, I don't know what to say",

It's the same thing as criticizing Uraraka from My Hero Academia for only having their development tie to Deku based on just the first 40 chapters of the manga the same time Deku's also pushing the growth of All Might, Bakugo, and Todoroki when the future valid criticism of Uraraka's wasted opportunity in future arcs by not letting her fight someone who opposes her ideologies in Stain or tying her goal for money for good persons against an antagonist in Overhaul's organization hasn't happened yet.",

With Deidara, he could only go up to 4-Tails before losing control. Against Orochimaru, Haku, and Sasuke, Naruto was more or less controlled by Kurama, acting like a wild beast. You can\u2019t compare those situations to Himawari\u2019s power-up, buddy.\n\n\n\u00bbGaara (\u2026)\u00ab.\n\n=> No feat Gaara has demonstrated with the 1-Tail comes close to matching Himawari's Bijuu Bomb, Inojin healing, Chakra Hair. \n\n\n\u00bbLee & Sasuke (\u2026)\u00ab.\n\n=> Lee gained his skills through sheer training, which is not comparable to Himawari's power-up at all. Sasuke's abilities were a combination of training and the Sharingan. Comparing Part 1 Sasuke's & Lee\u2019s progression with Himawari's should make the difference quite clear, if I may say so.\n\n\n\u00bbTemari (\u2026)\u00ab\n\n=> You still can't compare Part 1 Temari's feats to Himawari's. Also, let's not forget that Temari had difficulties against Shikamaru in the Chuunin exams.\n\n\nYou\u2019re comparing apples and oranges\n\nEdit to the person below: Compare Himawari\u2018s trajectory to **all the other trajectories from Pt 1 & Pt 2** and you\u2018ll see what I mean. Before the 3 years time-skip, Hima had nothing to do with the Shinobi (Manga). Time-skip ends, she gets Kurama reincarnated (?) into her just  in time and is now some kind of Bijuu (?) fighting against a thread that out-scales all of the Pt 1 and nearly all of the Pt 2 threats (save Kaguya, Madara and Obito 10-Tails). \n\nWould\u2018ve made much more sense if Kurama took over Himawari against Jura, like he did with Naruto during the WA.",

            "Yeah, Naruto before full access to Kurama's chakra wasn't a guarantee but it helped him bridge the gap and show Kurama wasn't playing nice or a easy power up option. Himawari's powerup came from a Kurama who had long grown past his hatred for humanity, was willing to even help someone like Kawaki out, chose to stay with naruto despite the option of going to roam free, and was willing to sacrifice himself at the time to take on a threat that could destroy the whole world. I can compare the two because one was from a dysnfuctional relationship that grew into a a loving one now become one where the matured person in said relationship is willing to guide the next kin in his old partner's life. Himawari has the Kurama whose development and wants to mold her into someone who can properly wield his chakra, much like Kurama taking the first step to work with Naruto.\n\nGaara lifted an village of sand in part 2 at the age of 16, only two years older than Himawari when he protected his entire village from a C3 explosion that's comparable to the small Juubi blast Himawari was able to fire.\n\nLee gained his skills through training, and while Himawari doesn't have as much training as he does, she's on the road to figuring out her power much like Lee had to figure out how to use the Eight Gates. If Lee had to get his start off screen, Himawari should be allowed to do so onscreen.\n\nAnd Sasuke started his training at the age of 7. Hima only properly had hers between the end of the series and the timeskip, yet Sasuke was giving a power he learned to embrace and get adapted to take on people who were taking on his classmates easily while Himwari got a power meant to help her and did the best she could until her lack of experience proved too be too much.\n\nTemari was also the child of a Kage and had an elite jonin as her mentor and Himawari also has her own struggles: her raw power and potential is held back by her lack of combat experience",

            "Likely because Yin is spirit energy, whereas Yang is physical energy. He could only take the nice half, leaving the angrier physical half in Naruto.",

            "Why didn\u2019t he sealed whole nine tiles into him instead of baby Naruto.",
            "Quick correction, it wasn't part 1. This was explained around the time Naruto was learning which element he had, when he was starting his Rasenshuriken training.",
            "Cuz fuck them kids.",
            "Is it not the other way around? Yang means Sun so I would\u2019ve thought minato sealed the side with less hate in naruto (it\u2019s been a good while since I touched naruto so forgive me if I\u2019m wrong lol)",
            "Can you specify where that was implied?",

            "Do you failures not pay attention? The other half of the Kyuubi was intended to be controlled\u00a0",
            "Because Naruto has the power of both his mother and father. He is the son of two people who have a great amount of chakra and his mother has the power to stop the 9 Tails, Minato put her chakra in Naruto where Minato can't put her chakra into himself, there's a reason why the Bad Kurama was in Naruto.",
            "Why didn\u2019t he sealed whole nine tails into him instead of baby Naruto",
            "Because he believed that Naruto could learn to harness the nine tails power.",
            "The side inside Naruto was definitely the hate filled one",
            "It is nowhere stated that Minato has good amount of chakra only Kushina",
            "Because leaving Konoha without a Tailed Beast is stupid.",
            "So he don\u2019t trust his son to become powerful on his own. Even without nine tails Naruto has uzumaki genes and sage mode",
            "I doubt it. The other Kurama just had the luxury of bonding with Minato for several decades inside of the belly of a Shikigami",
            "No one controlled nine tails before so it\u2019s useless to keep with konaha and it was a burden to people. There is hiruzen, jiraiya tsunade, Kakashi, guy. they are capable of defending the konoha against other nations.",
            "Even without Full Control, the first stage of the Chakra Cloak still makes any ninja an instant threat.\n\n\nPlus the other villages don't need to know that, all they know for certain is that Konoha has the Fox.",
            "Pretty much the seconrd arc in naruto or smt is the sand using their jinchuriki to their advantage, they were the balance of power all youd have to do if no1 else had a tailed beast would be drop your jinchuriki inside their village and let the bijuu go rampant and pretty much no1 would be able to stop it and at the very least a LOT of destruction would happen",
            "Actually they can control the nine tails because they had a whole clan with the ability to do so: The Uchihas.\n\nThe massacre only occurred years later.",
            "Beacuse of nine tails konaha lost an important asset and master jiraiya.",
            "Hiruzen ,jiraiya ,tsunade , Kakashi, guy are capable. No village would dare to attack konaha even if they attack they will lose.",
            "Only madara and few uchihas can control not all have the ability. If they could control why would they seal nine tails in Mito and kushina.",
            "Blaming the Ninetails for Pain killing Jiraiya is definitely a take, especially considering you can expand this logic and conclude that the Ninetails is the only reason Pain was stopped.",
            "Bro like youre arguing against the show, even WITH kurama the sand DID attack and would be all the easier if naruto didnt have kurama, yes it was bcs of orochimaru but still it clearly shows Konoha isnt as impervious as you think. Plus as hokage minato cant just think as ah its ok jiraiya and hiruzen got this, its much more than that its not about the next couple months you cant just trust 2 ppl are enough to protect the village the bijuu were the pillar that holded the nations from attacking each other, its the whole point of how they even began in the first place with hashirama, without some major differences to the whole world the bijuus were required especially in konoha, one of the most powerful villages, any sign of weakness and theyd all be coming we also see this worry after pain attacks, the bijuus are the irl equivalent of nuclear weapons, if major nations just stopped making them wed all be talking russian in a while",
            "Have you read or watched the series. It was stated by the author that beasts are a huge asset to a village, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re making up right here.",
            "The reason pain attacked was because of nine tails ,if not he would never interfere with konoha and he respects jiraiya.",
            "Yu are underestimating konoha, no village can defeat konoha Beacuse there are ninjas like hiruzen,minato,Kakashi, Guyyyy,Itachi (he would help too if village in trouble),Naruto,sasuke.",
            "They are asset for other villages, konoha always have good ninjas who are powerful than beasts. Konoha lost jiraiya and minato who are the most important assets of the village Beacuse of these beasts."

            "Well, Sasuke was the one who was left conscious at the end so I'd say yes.",
            "Depends on how you interpret the fight and how it could've gone differently\n\nNaruto scratched Sasuke's forehead but his headband protected him.    \n\nHowever, Sasuke was about to pierce Naruto's chest but instead curled his hand.",
            "YES!!!",
            "Yes Naruto wanted to bring Sasuke back, but didn't manage to do so and Sasuke left so he won.\n\nSasuke would also beat Naruto (without Kuruma) at Orochimaru's hideout. \n\nBut at the bridge after Kakashi and Sasuke fought, this form of Naruto would destroy him (as Zetsu said, post pain Naruto is stronger than Sasuke). \n\nAnd in the end he did win by forcing Sasuke to give up on his entire vision of the world and accepting that Naruto is the one to follow.",
            "He didn\u2019t win, that\u2019s for sure.",

            "Yes because by the end of it Naruto was unconscious and couldn't stop Sasuke",
            "He didn't win. In fact, the entire plot of Naruto Shippuden makes no sense if he did.\n\nNaruto contested Sasuke in terms of his physical strength and also in terms of his emotional and moral position (bonds are enough to give power). He lost.\n\nBy Naruto losing, it sets up the theme of \"Chasing Sasuke\" which predominates throughout Shippuden, and also serves as a backdrop to the reflection of the Sage's Sons, and the reflection of Hashirama and Madara.",
            "He lost, plain and simple, Sasuke was looking down on his unconscious body wondering if he should finish him off or not, that constitutes a loss in my books.",
            "Yes, but only because the plot dictated it. Suddenly sasuke's bones became adamantium and getting beat on like bongos by a jinchuriki wasnt enough to cripple him.",
            "Yes, the 9 tails saved him out dozens of times in this battle and each time gave him a boost",
            "No. He neither got what he wanted nor was still standing when it was over",
            "Naruto lost. No other answer. He possibly could\u2019ve won or drew if he went for Sasuke\u2019s chest instead of forehead. But he didn\u2019t take that chance, for the sake of proving a point.",
            "Duh he whoop naruto so bad, he needed the 9tails to carry him after getting beat vs 3 tomoe sasuke. The 1 tails cloak gave kurma complete control of his body, since he was running on all 4\u2019s and easily made a rasengan with 1 hands. Naruto needed his clones to be able to use rasengan until the war arc. If Sasuke wanted he could\u2019ve awakened a MS, if he killed Naruto defenseless body before Kakashi got to him but didn\u2019t want to follow Itachi path.",
            "1 person walked away from this fight",
            "Yes, curse mark v2 sasuke was stronger than naruto one tail , if they didn\u2019t decide to clash  and the fight went on longer, 2-3 tails came out, it was a wrap for sasuke. But this fight had more thematic winner.",
            "Poor kid was chasing on empty chakra reserve. \n\nSasuke though won the fight **was weak** if he went head on fully fit naruto.\n\nNaruto was wasting kurama chakra during kimimaro fight and did not use summonings too which would have changed the tide of fight easy.",
            "He may have won the battle (he was able to scratch Sasuke's forehead protector) but he has lost the war (Sasuke was the one left standing).",
            "Yes. Absolutely.\n\nFor those saying Naruto only lost cuz he wasn't trying to kill Sasuke, you can fight at full power without trying to kill someone, he knew he couldn't win the clash at the end so instead of fighting a losing battle he wanted to be petty and scratched Sasuke's headband, meaning there was no single point in the fight where Naruto could've just killed Sasuke but didn't.",
            "He would of won if he didnt lose",
            "I mean if another tail came out then sasuke would be dead...",
            "It was less a loss & more a draw, yes Sasuke didn't get knocked unconscious like Naruto did but he was in terrible condition, that snot kid that follows konohamaru around could probably kick his ass",
            "I think Naruto had the fight when he unlocked first tail but as soon as Sasuke got that third phase sharingan it was lowkey wraps",
            "Battle of intentions. I'd say it was a tie.",
            "I do believe people argue that the reason Naruto lost is because he wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. If this had been a real deathmatch with Naruto fighting to kill then he would've won but because that wasn't the case then Sasuke won.",
            "Still makes me think why Naruto didn\u2019t summon Gamaoyabin.\n\nI understand the author wanted Sasuke to win and leave Konoha. But completely forgetting Naruto's toad summon was bad.",
            "He scratched the head protection so he won",
            "Yes *but* we need to take in account one thing, Sasuke aimed his final chidori to take down Naruto while Naruto aimed for his headband.",
            "He threw the battle away. If he had gone to Sasuke with the intent to kill, like he did in the 2nd Battle  when he summoned Kurama's triple headed avatar, then he would have been successful in restraining and bringing Sasuke back like he did during the 2nd battle. At least they could have incapacitated each other until Kakashi reached the valley. Sasuke had no real answer to the Summoning Jutsu and Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu on the scale of what Naruto did against Gaara and Mizuki. Even if Gamabunta refused to help him (which he would  just remark about but ultimately help, that's just Gamabunta's personality), he would just have to use the summoning on Sasuke himself and have a massive Bijuu size toad fall on top of Sasuke.",
            "naruto pulled his hand at the last second and scratched sasuke headband",
            "yes and no, sasuke was trying to kill him naruto wasn't just like the 2nd final battle sasuke was trying to kill him naruto wasn't.",
            "We have no way to know cos this battle never happened at all at the valley of the end",
            "Obviously not, gosh I can't believe naruto fans didn't watch the show",
            "Actually everyone lost! But not Sasuke tho, Sasuke definitely won.",
            "I think what OP is really asking is, who was stronger at this point of time.\n\nSasuke winning this clash doesnt mean he was stronger imo. Sasuke fought the whole time with the intent to kill,like sure he spared him at the very end after the fight was over but not during the fight,that was when he was trying to kill Naruto cuz itachi told him it was a way to get stronger.\n\nNaruto was trying to beat him while trying to make sure not to kill him - he was holding back. Naruto's rasengan was proven stronger than Sasuke's chidori on the rooftop but the next time they clashed (right here at the valley of the end- which was the very next day) , their attacks cancelled out, showing naruto was holding back(he even implied he was) .\n\nAnd we forget before this fight naruto had to fight kimimaro, he had to chase the sound 4 the whole day and clashed with some of them which tired him out - all while sasuke was sleeping nicely and was fresh for their fight.\n\nSasuke only surpassed naruto after using Orochimaru's cursed mark.",
            "I'd like to see you awake after being roughly fisted without consent.",
            "Also Naruto went for the headband to prove to Sasuke that he could scratch it (Sasuke said at least twice that he couldn't). And as you said refused to go through with Itachi's recommendation. In the end, both would have been able to kill each other.

            "I think what OP is really asking is, who was stronger at this point of time.  \nNaruto without Kurama vs Sasuke before using Orochimaru's cursed mark, who is stronger?\n\nSasuke winning this clash doesnt mean he was stronger imo.

            "But Naruto's intention was to have Sasuke come back, and Sasuke wanted to leave. Sasuke left. That means he won.",
            "Many reasons, Naruto wanted to do this by himself and most likely Gamabunta wouldn't have helped him there.\n\nIt's one thing to fight against Ichibi or Orochimaru having summoned Manda but beating up a teenager wouldn't be acceptable.\n\nHe'd most likely k-o Naruto for such disrespect lol",
            "Gamabunta would've just said \"Nah, deal with your own beef\" and left",
            "He wouldn't have helped naruto anyways,  it would've been just a waste of chakra.",
            ">Sasuke had no real answer to the Summoning Jutsu and Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu on the scale of what Naruto did against Gaara and Mizuki.\n\nSasuke at this point is easily capable of dealing with a lot of shadow clones simultaneously, we saw him easily beat like 30 on the rooftop without his sharingan, in this fight he has a better curse mark and a 3-tomoe sharingan, those clones would not stand a chance. Gamabunta wasn't guaranteed to help him, plus Naruto doesn't want help when fighting Sasuke",

            "Didn't sasuke curse mark amplify his chidori and speed?",

            "Expecting to see Zoro and Korin traveling through fiction now",
            "I\u2019m not sure why you got downvoted \n\nBut ppl seem to forget \n\nSaskue without the cruse mark won\u2019t have survived\n\nSaskue eyes did evolve to 3 tome \n\nThe only thing different is saskue had fought garra who was a one tail and Almost died because he try not to relay on the mark and at that time he still haven\u2019t been to the next stage with the sound 5 where he take certain pills \ud83d\udc8a and dies and comes back to life.\n\n\nSo saskue was enhanced just as much as Naruto has the 9 tails.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is saskue if he was to use genjsuto he would win tho he never used it on Naruto and he never used it on garra\u2026 \n\n\nSaskue in that fight had power ups.\n\nNaruto did not fight with the intent to kill saskue \n\nWhere saskue basically decides not to kill Naruto because that\u2019s what his brother wants him to do and he saskue refused to kill him\u2026\n\nWould a non curse mark saskue at that time win such a fight against Naruto 1 tail 9tails form..",

            "naruto has more chakra and his rasengan was stronger. He also showed better taiijutsu and used clones to do taijutsu combos. I think they were pretty much equal but naruto had an edge because he could last longer in a fight, Uzumaki chakra reserves shouldn't be underestimated.",
            "No is it not , and naruto holding back (sarcasmus off)",
            "A decision he was free to make... Because he won.",
            "That's why sasuke had the upper hand in taijutsu with 3 tomoe sharingan",
            "Because Naruto beat him with \"talk no justsu\"",
            "Except Naruto wanted Sasuke to come back to the village, and that very clearly didn't happen. Because, again, he lost the fight.

Just fully strong basic uchihas\n\n- Sasuke should have had a fight that showed his full new abilities with the ems. That kabuto fight was mainly carried by itachi. We never saw Sasuke fully show off his new style with his new eyes.\n\n- the focus on certain support characters like omoi and samurai vs hanzo was a complete waste of time. \n\n- make it seem like a actual war. It shouldve been more gloomy. A lot of death. I mean a lot of death. Show characters running out of chakra and trying to retreat. Show the Villages fighting amongst each other as well. Gaaras speech should not be enough to quell tensions. \n\n- the hashirama flashback needed better pacing. I believe in show dont tell. Show the battles with the senju and uchiha. Show their strengths and weaknesses so we could really know how bad the warring states really were.\n\n- we needed a flashback of Madara and his family.

Then slowly have them each die to make it insanely more impactful. Or even just to have a few countries worth of armies on Madara and Obitos side alongside the Zetsu. So Mercenaries, Rogue Shinobi, Other Countries joining in and attacking them (Such as the ones from the West: Sky, Demons, Night, Volcanoes, etc), Criminal Organizations, etc. Having an actual 4th Great Shinobi War between West and East.\n\nAlso to have a build where the jinchuriki of each country is finding their own way away from their own countries since the beginning of Shippuden. Then all 7 unite for the war and kick ass.\n\nSidenote 1: \n\nI would also change initial Naruto show to still focus on Naruto of course but give development to Sakura, Ino, TenTen, and others that needed it. Along with have a sub series to introduce all of the jinchuriki in Original Naruto Timeline but have it where they are all doing their own things and none of them are in contact with Naruto. That way we can get to know each of them all and where they are from/ who they know. To give a better idea of how each will either aid or get in each other's way during Naruto Shippuden until the end.\n\nSidenote 2:\n\nFor Boruto, I would have had the show take place in missions where they are sent to the Western Countries Post-War (Since they have trains, etc) and that would allow for the Universe to be expanded on so much more in new ways since we haven't really been there much. New allies, enemies, etc since the West wouldn't be fully civilized yet/ haven't gotten over the 4th Shinobi War. Then for Otsutsuki instead of having them be from space just have their whole society living underground pulling all the strings and slowly reveal them to be beings that enjoy toying with those they perceive to be weaker than them. An invisible eye causing havoc and mayhem for thousands of years. Also, have them blind from living underground for so long. With Hinata, her clan, etc unveiling their lineage with Otsutsuki and the power they possess. Something I wish we saw in any point of regular Naruto or Naruto Shippuden was having Naruto and Hinata kick ass together\n\nSidenote 3:\n\nThis next idea way more so for a Fan-Made Manga/ Show. Just to humor the space thing and taking place a few generations ahead of Boruto. It would be interesting if they have space travel via jutsu and technology. Have them discover other planets, dimensions, & species who can also use jutsu and other new things to expand on jutsu & chakra overall in all kinds of new ways. Calling the show Faruto or something as it's going to be the farthest it can get for travel. Sure it won't resonate with many of ya but how I'm envisioning it would be something people would really enjoy when done well.\n\nBattles taking place on asteroids or outside spaceships while Wall-Walking and fighting in Zero-G would be a unique twist. New forms of chakra usage aside from Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, Taijustu, and all the eye forms would be sick too! Maybe even a species that has 4 arms and is able to conduct 2 jutsu at the same time or even make a much more complicated one that we haven't seen before due to that (Kinda like how Naruto used a shadow clone when he first making rasengans). Other forms using the ears, touch, smell, etc enhanced by chakra. Exploring other forms that are different from Rasengans, Chidori, Lightning Blade, those are just 3. But most likely there are way more than those!! And so much more that can be done.\n\nDamnit I want to make all 4 of those now. So much can be done to improve each idea",

The spikes were shot before he even jumped, and were still less than a quarter of the way towards him when he made it up...

            "It doesn't make sense when you consider how many shinobi participate in the chunin exams and how many chunin receive promotions in any given exam.  The Leaf had 1 whole promotion?  And there was repeated remarks that the amount of ninja who made it through round 1 and round 2 were excessive and this was the first time they needed a pre-lim round 3 in 5 years.  The Leaf got 1 promotion, the Sand got 3, and none of the other 4 villages had ANY.  And the chunin exam isn't held every 6 months like clockwork, because we see numerous occurrences where it gets skipped for spans like 2 or 2.5 years.  So, in a 30 year span (e.g. ninjas aged between 16 and 46), they're probably promoting about 150 chunins across all of the villages who participated.  And of those 150, probably about 75 or 90 of them are gonna die on missions before they reach 30 years old (that's not even including Konoha Crush).  So all of those villages -- Grass, Rain, Leaf, Sand, etc. they all collectively only have something like 60 surviving chunin or higher.  I imagine almost anyone allowed to fight in the Great Shinobi Alliance were chunin or higher, aside from specific freak genin like Naruto; e.g. it's probably 75,000 chunin and 5,000 genin.  So then the other villages who didn't participate in the Leaf exam, like the Cloud and Stone, they're contributing about 74,940 of the 75,000 chunin+.  If the Leaf and Sand were that much smaller than the Cloud, Stone, and Mist; then they wouldn't be great nations at all.\n\nOr you might think the Shinobi Alliance was consisted of mostly genin.  So that's about 60 chunin+ from the Leaf / Sand / Waterfall / Grass / Rain, maybe another 100 from the Stone / Cloud / Mist / other minor villages (figuring they're about in proportion to the Sand and Leaf), and that leaves 79,840 genin.  So is it your theory that only 0.2% of all shinobi are chunin+?  I'm pretty confident that most ninjas inevitably make it to chunin by the time they're 17-18.  So I doubt that the proportion of ninja who are chunin+ is as low as 0.2%.\n\nNo, the numbers truly don't make sense, no matter how you look at it.

Are we forgetting **he literally tried to kill Hinata during their fight** in the chunin exams because he was spiteful (which was against the rules)?\n\nThis might just be his way of making up for it. He believed he was a slave to the main clan back then because he thought his dad was sacrificed for the main clan as a slave. He changed his mind when he found out the truth\n\nYou could argue the execution of it was bad but thematically it made perfect sense for his character. and he was out of chakra from fighting tons of white zetsus so he couldnt use hyuga clan jutsus to protect hinata.\n\nHow was neji right?

Also the chunin exams in part 1 was not all of the nations. Most of them have been holding their own exams separately and likely promoting much more members as the ninja of other villages seem to have a lower standard for what is considered \"skilled\". Almost every ninja thats not from the leaf or sand is complete fodder. The cloud has only shown like 3 ninja capable of defeating any of the konoha 11 during the war. The stone has no one qualified to take the tsuchikages place which is the only reason he hasnt retired, his broken back is from carrying his whole village through multiple wars by himself. And the mist has been dealing with civil unrest since before the series started. Having larger numbers means nothing when the leaf has shown in multiple wars the ability to have 1 guy wipe out entire battalions singlehandedly.  Hashirama, minato, the sannin, kakashi, when a village consistently pumps out ninja that make the other army scared just by hearing the name it makes sense to stop trying to fight that village.",
            "That also includes the samurai who are shown to mostly be unskilled troops with limited ability to manipulate chakra, as well as a ton of fodder ninja that were useless against powerful ninja. The leaf may have had less people but their alliance with the sand would mean declaring war on them would be declaring war on both, most villages would be pretty afraid of fighting 2 jinchuriki and famous ninja such as kakashi and 2 of the sannin. Minato took out like 10000 guys by himself you really want to test his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and mentor at the same time? We see alot of ninja from other villages in the war but almost none of them are actually shown to be very strong. The stone used the akatsuki because they needed the extra strength. I mean look at the old man with the broken spine that is supposed to be their strongest, you dont think he would be retired if he could find someone worthy to replace him?",
            "The leaf took out all akatsuki basically obito n sasuke from da leaf so they kills count as leaf kills",
            "Bro this is ww4 in the Naruto verse.",
            "No they detected from the leaf so no they don't."
