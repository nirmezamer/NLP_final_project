The officer walks over and knocks on the window.\r  \n\r  \n\"You know why I pulled you over\"\r  \n\r  \nThe driver accepts his fate and steers into the skid, takes a huge gulp of his beer and says \"cus you thought I was cute and it's lonely in these parts\"\r  \n\r  \nThe officer has dealt with this kind of dude before and he looks to be in no mood.\r  \n\r  \n\"Sir I'm gonna have to ask that you step out of the vehicle\"\r  \n\r  \nThe driver attempts to slide out of the front seat while slurring \"and you officer, have the right to remain (he burps) sexy\"\r  \n\r  \nHe falls out of the car onto his hands and knees.\r  \n\r  \n\"Okay buddy so we can either do a field sobriety test or we can just get it over with and brethalyze ya. Seeing as you can't very well stand how but we make this easy on the both of us?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Bring me the sucker\"\r  \n\r  \nThe officer nods and pulls out a breathalyzer\r  \n\r  \n\"Take one deep breath and then blow as hard as you can\"\r  \n\r  \nThe driver just kinda looks off into the distance and shakes his head yes. He takes a deep inhale and starts to blow\"\r  \n\r  \nHe then starts bobbing his head back and fourth. He looks up at the officer with fuck me eyes and grabs the base of the breathalyzer with his and starts to add a twisting motion. The officer, who is now visibly uncomfortable mutters \"hey there uh knock it off buddy\"\r  \n\r  \nThe driver doubles down and and grabs the coo by his ass pulling him forward pushing the breathalyzer deep into his mouth.\r  \n\r  \nThe cop lets out a moan and puts one of his hands on the back of the drivers head. The camera pans out and you can see the officer and driver behind the hood of the car. The drivers head twisting and turning and the officer looking increasingly satisfied. He starts to whisper I'm gonna I'm gonna--- ughhhhh as the breathalyzer beeps that it is done.\r  \n\r  \nThe officer looks relieved. The driver stands up wipes his chin and asks \"so we good here\"\r  \n\r  \nThe officer looking conflicted looks down at the breathalyzer that reads \"he needs a hospital\" and replies sure but let me drive you home.\r  \n\r  \nThey pull up to the man's house and it is always. The officer sighs and asks \"so will I see you again?\"\r  \n\r  \nThe driver replies \"eh I don't know I'll call ya\"\r  \n\r  \nThe officer is taking the hint but decides to go for one last kiss. He really plants one but the other man is looking frigid and has his eyes open.\r  \n\r  \nIt is super awkward and the driver ends up just drunkenly getting out of the car and walking into the distance.\r  \n\r  \nThe cop sits in silence and takes a look at himself in the mirror.\r  \n\r  \n\"You fall hard and fast ray. It's not your fault people can't handle your intensity\"\r  \n\r  \nHe pulls off and starts blasting Kay patty your a firework and starts looking for someone else to pull over",

In case you are, please read the below:\n\n# FAQ\n\n**What does that mean?**\n\nI have intentions of urinating into your anal cavity.\n\n**What made you want to pee in my ass?**\n\nOne guy posted about how one time some guys at a party were goading him into having sex with some slut who lets people put it in her butt. So someone suggested he pee in her butt and at first the guy was like \\*\\*\\*\\* no that gross but then they all said they would pay him like $200 combined. Eventually he went up stairs and was nailing her in the ass when he started to pee in her butt. It was just a little but enough for her to notice and send her screaming. He went down and collected his money while the guys laughed about how he just peed in a girls butt.\n\n**Are you really going to pee in my ass?**\n\nYes, I will.\n\n**Are you going to do it to everyone?**\n\nYou could say I am going to pee in everybody's ass, in which case you're probably right, but I won't tell you more about this business.\n\n**When are you planning to do it?**\n\nAt a random time, always be aware.\n\n**How will you pee in my ass?**\n\nFirstly, I will carefully approach your ass until it is available for me to pee in. Then I will pull out my pisser and pee in your ass.\n\n**What should I do when you pee in my ass?**\n\nDo not resist.\n\n**Can I prevent my ass from getting pissed in?**\n\nYou cannot escape me.\n\n**Do I call the police?**\n\nThe authorities will not help you.\n\n**What are the consequences of you peeing in my ass?**\n\nSide effects may include but not limited to:\n\n* Butt pissing\n* Rectal infection\n* Diarrhea\n* Ligma\n* And even death\n\n**What if I am ok with you peeing in my ass?**\n\nI will make sure you\u2019re not.\n\n**Are you a troll?**\n\nIMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS IMMA PEE IN UR ASS\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to ask below.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nimma pee in ur ass\n\n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u284f\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2846\u2800\u28e0\u281e\u28bb\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2818\u28b7\u28f6\u28e4\u2820\u2813\u280b\u2801\u2800\u28b8\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2801\u28c0\u28c0\u2840\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28e4\u2864\u2816\u281b\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2819\u281b\u2880\u28c0\u28c0\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u287d\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2833\u2844\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2838\u28ff\u28a1\u28fe\u28e7\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28f7\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u2807\u2818\u281b\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2812\u2812\u2822\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2820\u2864\u2884\u287c\u2803\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2838\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2818\u28bb\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u283b\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28f4\u281b\u28e6\u2800\u2800\u2880\u281e\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2833\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2878\u2800\u2808\u281b\u28f6\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2874\u289b\u285d\u2801\u2819\u283f\u287f\u281b\u281a\u2887\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28fd\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u2801\u28fe\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2888\u28f3\u2866\u281a\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u28f4\u289f\u28ff\u28e6\u28c4\u2840\u2808\u28a7\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2838\u284f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2839\u28ee\u28f7\u28e4\u2848\u2819\u281b\u2832\u281f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u2833\u28a6\u28c4\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2846\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2809\u283b\u28d6\u2826\u28e4\u28e4\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2887\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u280b\u2800\u2838\u28ff\u2857\u2800\u2800\u287c\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2813\u2812\u2809\u2818\u2827\u2864\u2834\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800",

            "Here's a simple explanation of the text along with the key points highlighted in a numbered list:\n\n1. There is a new rule called the \"no literal erotica\" rule.\n2. The rule means that explicit sexual content or stories that are purely focused on erotica are not allowed.\n3. The aim is to ensure that the posts in the community are in line with the spirit of copypasta (a type of text that is often copied and shared online).\n4. Posts that are sexually explicit or NSFW (not safe for work) are still permitted, as long as they are not purely erotica.\n5. The rule specifically targets posts that resemble inappropriate or disturbing content, particularly those with a focus on incest or underage themes.\n6. The rule will be enforced, but not necessarily heavily, unless the content is particularly strange or unsettling.\n7. If unsure about whether a post fits the guidelines, they encourage asking the question, \"where the hell am I gonna paste this?\"\n8. The person who made the announcement is addressed as the \"tyrant-in-chief\" and their username is u/Derpster3000.\nHere's some more information:\n9. The person behind the announcement is referred to as the \"tyrant-in-chief\" and goes by the username u/Derpster3000. This suggests a playful tone to the message.\n10. The purpose of the new rule is to maintain the integrity and appropriateness of the copypasta community. Copypasta typically refers to text that is shared and copied across different online platforms.\n11. While sexual or NSFW (not safe for work) posts are still allowed, they should not be purely focused on erotica. The intention is to ensure that the content aligns with the overall nature and essence of copypasta discussions.\n12. The rule particularly targets explicit posts that involve incestuous or underage themes. These types of posts, characterized as \"weird shit,\" will be more strictly enforced and likely to be removed.\n13. The individual behind this rule acknowledges that they will not heavily enforce it unless the content is exceptionally strange or disturbing. This implies a somewhat lenient approach to moderating the community.\n14. To clarify further, the term \"erotica\" is used to describe explicit or sexually oriented content. In this context, the mention of \"I, M15, desire my dad\" type posts illustrates the specific nature of the prohibited content.\n\nIn summary, the text announces a new rule in a community that prohibits purely erotic content, with a focus on incest or underage themes. Posts that are sexually explicit but not purely erotica are still allowed. The rule will be enforced and people are encouraged to ask themselves where they would share the content before posting it.",

            "I awoke last night with pins and needles coating my entire body. The sharp sting that got worse the more I moved my limbs was a shock to my system, but at least it got me out of a horrible nightmare.\nIn the nightmare, I was at a beach with no one on it, only me. It was completely abandoned, as if everyone took their things and ran from some unknowable entity. In the distance was a ferris wheel which looked like it had been rusted for years, yet still spun. I boarded it and rested my weary bones. I stood back up once I reached the top and the wheel stopped spinning. I looked out into the ocean sunset, it was too beautiful to be real.\nI felt a presence next to me, it was comforting. I turned around and there she was in all her wonder. The Penis Monkey. We embraced and I stroked her silky fur which led down to one of her many penis appendages. At this point I knew this was all a dream, but I didn't care. I loved her.\nThat's when things took a turn for the worst. A musky yet familiar smell filled my nostrils. I looked down into the water and saw white tendrils emerge from the depths and begin to cover the entire beach before working its way up the ferris wheel. All I could do was watch in horror as The Penis Monkey was coated by the mass of tendrils.\nI could still hear her screams of agony as I to v covered in the white substance.\nThat's when I woke up. It all felt so real but I didn't have much time to think about it as I was late for work. I live within walking distance from my job but in order to get there I have to walk through some sketchy alleyways. During the day it's not so bad but l've heard rumors of people going missing at night. I never really have to work overtime, so this doesn't really affect me too much. I just go about my day blissfully ignorant.\nWhen I was heading up to work today, however I noticed something strange. That same musky yet familiar smell was prevalent when I was walking through the alley. I thought nothing of it and rushed to work, by then I was already late. My boss, The Penis Monkey had gone missing a few days ago, nobody really cared since he was a real prick but it meant that I could get away with being late.\nOn my way back from work, I noticed something very strange. A sticky white substance was on the red brick wall of the alleyway. It had a musky yet familiar smell... I shoved whatever insane thoughts crept into the back of my head and picked up the pace. The sooner I got home the better.\nTran back home, hoping that once sunk my head into the pillow, I would forget all the nightmares and whatever twisted thoughts of the alleyway I had. I reached my door but... the lock had been broken. Oh God, someone had broken into my home. I slowly opened the door and almost instantly that same musky vet familiar smell filled my nostrils. \"Don't let this be real\" I remember thinking to myself. I slowly but surely approached my bedroom, where the smell seemed strongest.\n1 slowly opened the door and carefully turned on the light. My bed had been covered in the same white substance I saw in the alleyway and in my dream. I stood there in shock and fear, I couldn't process what I was looking at. Suddenly I felt a presence behind me. I quickly turned around and was horrified by what I saw.\nA monkey, about seven feet tall, wearing a black hoodie with mysterious stains on it. It had no hands or feet, instead it had penises on the ends of its limbs. It began to scream loudly and pounced on me. I tried to fight it but there was nothing I could do. Liquid began to spurt from its appendages and drip onto me. It was hot but cooled quickly and hardened. It wasn't long before I was completely cocooned by the liquid. I passed out. \nI don't know how long it had been before I woke up. I wasn't in my room anymore. Instead I was in the alleyway, now completely covered in the liquid. I looked around and there were others like me, covered in the same liquid the creature squirted out. After a bit of struggling, I managed to break free of my prison. I fell to the ground, but it wasn't my hands that caught my fall. Please God no. I looked down at where my hands used to be. Instead there was... penises. I examined myself further. I was covered in damp hazel fur. I screamed in agony, for in that moment I realized that I was no longer human. I had become The Penis Monkey.",

            "Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now.",

            "Semen infinito. Te sientas en el ba\u00f1o para masturbarte pero empiezas a correrte incontrolablemente. Despu\u00e9s de diez rachas empiezas a preocuparte. Tu mano est\u00e1 pegajosa y apesta a semen. Empujas desesperadamente tu polla en un fajo de papel higi\u00e9nico, pero solo te duelen las bolas. El semen se acelera. Han pasado tres minutos. No puedes dejar de correrte. El piso de tu ba\u00f1o est\u00e1 cubierto con una fina capa de l\u00edquido de beb\u00e9s. Intentas correrte en el desag\u00fce de la ducha, pero se acumula demasiado r\u00e1pido. Pruebas el ba\u00f1o. El semen es demasiado espeso para tirarlo. Cierras la puerta del ba\u00f1o para evitar que el semen se escape. El aire se vuelve caliente y h\u00famedo por el semen. El semen se acelera. Te resbalas y caes en tu propio esperma. El semen ahora tiene seis pulgadas de profundidad, casi tan largo como tu manguera de semen a\u00fan erecta. Tumbado sobre tu espalda, comienzas a correrte por todo el techo. Globos del fluido blanco pegajoso comienzan a caer como gotas de lluvia, d\u00e1ndote un facial con tu propio semen. El semen se acelera. Luchas por pararte mientras la fuerza del semen comienza a impulsarte hacia atr\u00e1s como si estuvieras en un deslizamiento y deslizamiento tem\u00e1tico de bukkake. A\u00fan de rodillas, el semen ahora est\u00e1 a la altura de la barbilla. Para evitar ahogarse, abres la puerta del ba\u00f1o. El diluvio de jugo de hombre te recuerda a la Gran Inundaci\u00f3n de Melaza de 1919 (es algo real, b\u00fascalo), solo con semen en lugar de melaza. El semen se acelera. Han pasado dos horas. Tus hijos y su esposa gritan de terror mientras sus cuerpos son engullidos por el lodo blanco como la nieve. Tu hijo m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o se hunde, con burbujas viscosas y gritos ahogados que salen de la sustancia pegajosa. Le ruegas a Dios que ponga fin a tu sufrimiento. El semen se acelera. Aprietas tu polla para detener el semen, pero en su lugar comienza a gotear por el culo. D\u00e9jalo ir. La fuerza del semen abre tu uretra, dejando solo un gran agujero en la entrepierna que arroja semen.Los helic\u00f3pteros militares te rodean. Cientos de balas perforan tu cuerpo, pero permaneces consciente. Tus test\u00edculos ahora se han convertido en un cerebro sustituto. El semen se acelera. Han pasado dos d\u00edas. Con tu cuerpo ahora destruido, el semen comienza a rociarse en todas direcciones. Rompes la barrera del sonido. El gobierno despliega aviones de combate para perseguirte, pero el impacto de tu semen hace que un avi\u00f3n se estrelle contra el suelo. El gobierno decide dejarte salir de la tierra. Sientes que tus g\u00f3nadas comienzan a quemarse a medida que alcanzas los bordes de la atm\u00f3sfera. Se pierde por poco la ISS, d\u00e1ndole un nuevo trabajo de pintura blanca mientras pasa volando. Los f\u00edsicos luchan por calcular tu trayectoria err\u00e1tica. El semen se acelera. El semen comienza a gravitar hacia s\u00ed mismo, formando un rastro cometa de semen. Los astr\u00f3nomos comienzan a llamarte \"Cummet\". Est\u00e1s atrapado en el espacio para siempre, despojado de tu cuerpo y sentidos, obligado a soportar una eternidad de corridas. Finalmente, dejas de pensar ... a medida que tu conciencia se desvanece en la oscuridad, el abismo infinito, tu semen se fusiona con el continuo espacio-tiempo. Ahora no hay nada. Nada... excepto cum.",

            "I shall paste my hard work Grimace Shake fanfic here\n\nI got raped by Grimace. Yes, the one from McDonalds. This is my story. It was 2023--the Grimace Shake was the new hit. I walked into the McDonalds near my local church, because that was the one I went to most frequently. I walked into the empty line. I looked into the eyes of the cashier and said \"One Grimace Shake, my good sir.\"   \n\nHe shivered. I didn't know why, but he looked terrified. Soon enough, I would know why he had a look of...grimace.   \n\n\"Sir, are you sure...?\" he trembled. \"...there are many other great options!\" I was confident that I would get the Grimace Shake. My TikTok and Instagram were all doing poorly. I needed more likes, views, and followers.   \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said with a strong voice. \u201c\u2026coming right up, sir. God bless you.\u201d the cashier drearily whispered. \u201c\u2026have a nice day.\u201d I responded back the same and headed for my vehicle. As I drove back, ready with the purple paint I bought from Lowe\u2019s, something was smelling strange. I thought it was nothing.   \n\nBut it grew stronger. And stronger. And stronger. And stronger. I looked at my Grimace Shake and it was spewing out a purple gas, as if it was dry ice. Soon enough, it grew so, so terrifyingly strong. I slammed on the pedal, numbers I didn\u2019t know my car could go. I felt like I was going to pass out\u2026and I did.  \n\nAll of a sudden, I awoke in my house. I\u2019m covered in sweat. The reflection of my television showed my red face. My teeth hurt, most likely I was clenching them, like a fist when rage is flowing through one\u2019s body.  \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that dream?\u201d I thought, confused. I look around and come to my senses. I\u2019m naked. No blankets. No pillows. My penis was erect for some strange reason, but I find that someone, or something, had fed me Viagra as I was sleeping. Then the door slowly opened. I watched in horror.  \n\n\u201cI live alone!\u201d I thought. But I was not alone for the next few horrifying hours. There was a mumble. Perhaps a gurgle. Was it a laugh perchance? I didn\u2019t know. Once the silhouette came into my strip lights, I new what it was now. It was Grimace.   \n\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2026I hadn\u2019t even drunken it! Please spare me!\u201d I shouted in horror. It was too late. Grimace was now naked. I didn\u2019t even know he had clothes on, but I could tell now. He was bigger than me. Way. Bigger. He didn\u2019t go soft on me. All of a sudden, he\u2019s fucking me like I\u2019m his personal flesh light.   \n\n\u201cF-fuck\\\\\\~! H-how are y-you so big\\\\\\~!?\u201d I moaned. Somehow he\u2019s hypnotizing me. I\u2019m\u2026enjoying this!?! His company was comforting. I want to submit to him. I wanted him to use me any time, any day. Then\u2026he came. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201ccame\u201d. Perchance there is a plural for came. Anyways, he came so much, I thought I was pregnant. Turns out he was cumming so much that my belly was inflating, from the amount of man-milk he was producing and putting inside me. All of a sudden, he grabs me. He puts me on my knees.   \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing now, Grimace-senpai\\\\\\~?\u201d I spoke submissively. Now, it was going down my throat like a train. I was trying to breathe, but I couldn\u2019t. Then, after about 10 seconds, he cums. Fast, right? My belly inflated more. It spurted out of my nose. There was so much, it dripped out my ass. Then, he pulls out. I lay on the bed, my ass destroyed and throat more sore than a sick day off.  \n\n\u201cI love you, Grimace-senpai.\u201d That\u2019s what I wanted to say. But I couldn\u2019t speak. I wanted to say it to him. I needed to say it to him. I need to say it to him. I still want him. He\u2019s my one and only crush. But he was already gone by the time I was able to move and talk again.  \n\nI need him in my life.I love you, Grimace. I still remember you.",

            "\nYou swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. I wager you couldn't empty a boot of excrement were the instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.\r  \n\r  \nYou snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.\r  \n\r  \nAnd what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh.\r  \n\r  \nYou have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed , drooling meatslapper. You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.\r  \n\r  \nYou are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on.\r  \n\r  \nThis is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective.\r  \n\r  \nTrue, these are rudimentary skills that many of us \"normal\" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are \"challenged\" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been \"right\". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.\r  \n\r  \nYou're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out.

            "I had sex with my dad\n\nSo my dad was always a super nerdy man. Like you know... Skinny, lanky arms and legs, suspenders, glasses, buck teeth, acne, rosacea, and greasy hair! We lived in a real banged up house, and he had a crack in his door that I could peak into. He would like, jerk off every night. I would stand outside and look through the hole, and I would actually jack off as he was jacking off. We would always cum at the same time! I would shoot my load all over his door, and it eventually dried up into cum crust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day, my dad questioned me about it. \"What's that crusty stuff on the door, Earl?\" I began getting nervous. \"It's... It's my cum, daddy.\" He was wearing basketball shorts that day for some reason and I saw his ice hard rock sticking out inside his shorts! My mouth began watering. Then he grabbed me and rammed me against a wall. I felt his tongue against my neck and he began thrusting into me with his shorts still on. We both began taking off our clothes as fast as we could and then he shoved me to the ground. I hit my head against the wall and the room began spinning in circles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then grabbed me by the neck and shoved my neck between his hot, pasty white cheesy nerd thighs. I felt his thighs grip my neck as hard as they could. I could actually feel his pulse through his thighs, that's how hard he was gripping my neck. I felt myself suffocating. Just before I passed out from lack of oxygen, he grabbed me by the arms and tossed me onto his bed, doggy style. Then he began ramming my ass so hard without lube. When he took his dick out after ejaculating inside my tight ass, it was covered in blood. He shoved it in my mouth and I tasted a mix of fecal matter and blood. Once I was done sucking him off, he sat on my face with my mouth open. I smelled his ass juice, my nose was inside his ass crack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he began taking a shit in my mouth. I began gagging and dry heaving, the taste was horrendous! When he got up, I vomited all over myself. This sexy nerd, my dad, began rubbing his face in my vomit. When he looked back up at me, his glasses and acne covered face were coated in vomit. Then, out of disgust, he vomited all over my genitalia. My dick got hard immediately as my dad began sucking me off, swallowing his vomit. He then squatted over me again and took another shit on me. I took it in my hands and smeared it all over my body. I made sure to smear some of the poop on my dick to use as lube. I then laid down and my dad began riding my cock. I shot the biggest load inside his ass and when I pulled my dick out, for some reason some brown sludge came out of his ass, it was in a soft serve ice cream consistency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I love your shit, please give it to me daddy,\" I murmured. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe ordered me to lick the vomit and poop off his glasses so I did. I licked it all up and I tried vomiting some more, but I had already vomited enough and nothing came out, so I just sat there dry heaving. My dad then punched me in the face and told me to \"get it together son.\" He grabbed me by the hair and began making out with me. Once he was done, he tossed me to the ground and began pissing all over my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I want you to poop on me, daddy,\" I begged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe told me to stop begging and wrapped his thighs around my neck again. He began strangling me. When he let go, he stood over my face as promised and shit came out of his ass. Instead of solid shit, it was all of a soft serve ice cream consistency. My entire body was covered, head to toe, in shit, vomit, and piss. I felt used and degraded. Once my dad was finished with me, he spit on me and told me to \"get lost\" and that I'm \"really pathetic.\"",

            "It is important to note that not every instance of a rule being enforced is equivalent to the world of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nFirstly, in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the government uses technology and surveillance to control every aspect of the citizens' lives. The citizens are constantly monitored through telescreens and thought police, and any deviation from the established norms is punished severely. In contrast, in most modern societies, there are rules and laws that are put in place to protect the citizens' safety and well-being. These laws are enforced by the government, but they do not involve constant surveillance or the use of technology to control the citizens' thoughts and actions.\n\nSecondly, in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the government uses propaganda and censorship to control the citizens' thoughts and opinions. The government manipulates history and language to maintain power and control over the citizens. In contrast, in most modern societies, freedom of speech and expression is protected by law, and citizens are free to voice their opinions and criticisms of the government without fear of punishment. The government does not control the media or manipulate history to maintain power and control over the citizens.\n\nFinally, in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the government uses torture and brainwashing to maintain control over the citizens. The citizens are forced to conform to the government's ideology, and any deviation from the established norms is punished severely. In contrast, in most modern societies, the government does not use torture or brainwashing to control the citizens. Instead, the citizens are free to choose their own beliefs and opinions, and the government respects their freedom of thought and conscience. In conclusion, while there are instances where rules and laws are enforced in modern societies, it is important to note that not every instance of a rule being enforced is equivalent to the world of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Modern societies protect the citizens' freedom and individuality, while the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four is a dystopian society where the citizens are deprived of their freedom and individuality.",

        "content": "Girl I slept with grossed out I ate my own cum\n\nHey everyone. Gonna get right into it. I\u2019m 26 M and I eat my own cum, I can\u2019t explain why tbh lol it\u2019s easy for me to clean up and ig there is something erotic about it, i\u2019m still horny after i nut too. \n\nI\u2019ve done this since I started jerking off basically. I dated my ex for about 5 years and i would always lick it off her when i was done. once she started birth control i was able to cum inside her and from there i ate it out of her after sex. \n\nFast forward, i\u2019ve been single and dating for about two years and have been on a couple dates and when those led to something I would wear a condom and cum in it but resisted the urge to eat it.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to this girl for a few weeks and we went on a few dates but yesterday my roommates out of town so I invited her over and we had sex. she was on BC so she let me cum inside her. after that i went down on her and started eating her and my cum out of her pussy. I was so turned on since I haven\u2019t been able to do that for almost two years. \n\nShe enjoyed the eating out session but was grossed out that I did it after i came in her and saw me actively licking it. Today texted me today and asked if i was gay and told me it was disgusting. \n\nGoing forward, is this something I should warn girls about? It\u2019s almost instinct for me to clean it up and taste it. \n\nEdit: I want to clarify about the condom part. The way I wrote sounds that I REALLY craved my condom jizz but when I was writing it I was trying to convey that cumming in the condom turned me off of from eating it that way. There really was no urge to eat cum if it\u2019s not on or in the girl i\u2019m with. if my cum ever shot on the bed i wasn\u2019t going out of my way to lick the sheets lol ",

        "content": "\n\nBasically my 19 year old roomate (who is also my best friend) recently broke up with his girlfriend, since then I've noticed he has been jerking off way more in the toilet (which is fine, a guys gotta do what a guys gotta do), but thing is our walls are paper thin, and I can hear the fapping sounds and even occasional porn moans from his headphones. I don't really jerk off much because I have a girlfriend, but would probably do the same if I were in his position. Should I mention it to him since he obviously isn't getting any action? To be completely honest what would I even say? Another seperate thing is he recently bought a fleshlight and leaves it around in the shower, at first I didn't have a problem with it but recently I had a friend come over who saw it and mentioned it was weird, this sorta made me change my mind on it. Would I be an asshole if I asked him to pack it away somewhere else, but idk how those things work if they need to be washed and its easier to keep in the shower for that or whatever?\nHas anyone been in a similar circumstance ?",
