            "As a parent, I understand the fear of having a child snatched from you. When you got 5 of them the same age, you would feel like an easy target. I'd have my 5 kids on leashes too. Couldn't live with losing one.",
            "I used to judge people who put leashes on their kids. Then I had kids and now I don\u2019t judge them. I don\u2019t do it myself, but I don\u2019t judge anyone who does.",

The only time I used a leash with her was when I took her to Disneyland by myself.  It was too crowded there and I didn't want to lose her.  \n\nBut with 5 kids?  I completely understand.  Good dad.",

            "I was a leash kid. I didn't like holding hands. And if my parents weren't in my direct field of view, I tended to panic and run off looking for them. I hadn't quite mastered the art of *looking behind me*. My leash tied to my wrist. It made me feel confident that my parents were nearby.",
            "Imagine if all of them are runners. I have 1 runner and even that's too much sometimes. Humorously most of the people who would take issue with this don't even have children.",

I think it\u2019s awesome he can do stuff solo and give his baby momma some downtime.",
            "My mom leashed me.  I totally deserved, and required it.  I don't blame her one bit.\n\nIt's not like she didn't TRY to take me in public without the leash.  I just wouldn't be denied my freedom to run.",

We couldn't take him to fairs or anything with big crowds without heart attacks until we got one of those wrist tethers to attach him to mom the whole time. We didn't have this full harness like this. Just something that went on both his and moms wrists that had about 6 feet of slack on it. Just a thin ribbon.  When they were holding hands she would have it mostly rolled up in her hand so you wouldn't even know it. \n\n  \nTrust me.

I'd say that if you're still using them at around the age of 8, you're definitely entering that territory.\n\nI'd also say that a kid leash has to be used very differently from a dog leash. Never try to use the leash to control them like you would a dog, instead use it as training wheels to teach them that the safest place is right next to you. That way, you as a parent don't end up relying on the leash, and you can eventually get the kid out of it.",

I agree that extenuating circumstances happen, but kids deserve to be kids; the phycological effects of raising a child, as a child, are profound.

It'd be super embarrassing for both the child and the parent (even if the parent doesn't realize that) if they kept doing it when the kid was older, but I hate calling this kind of thing \"abuse\" because it feels like watering down the weight of the word.",
            "But you don't know if they were still a kid. I do know people who are 20 or more years older than their siblings because one of their parents had another child with a second husband or wife.

The motorcyclist drew his own gun and shot her five times.\n\n\n**Charges**\nNone - shooting was found to be justifiable homicide\n\nMorales, who was reported by her mother to be five months pregnant, was pronounced dead following arrival at a nearby hospital. The shooter, who had a concealed carry permit, was taken into police custody and released pending the investigation. Authorities were unable to confirm her pregnancy during the autopsy. Four months later the local prosecutor's office announced it had found the shooting justified as self-defense and would not be filing charges.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Sara-Nicole_Morales",

By the guy she hit with her car who was legally concealed carrying. So he ended up getting off free and clear( I believe because he didn\u2019t take out his weapon or anything util she came out gun in hand). And I honestly can\u2019t blame the courts. Only problem was he followed her home but again she hit him off his motorcycle and then proceeded to run away from a hit and run. It\u2019s a shame she made every single bad choice available to her.
