            "I think this thread needs a sticky for best practices when asking for wood ID help. Suggest:\n\n1. If possible, clean up the wood with a plane (or chisel for the end grain) so that we can see the grain clearly. \n2. Include a close-up picture of the end grain. Not blurry. End grain pore structure is one of the most useful bits of info for wood ID. \n3. Note any non-visual distinguishing characteristics. Does the wood feel particularly light or particularly dense? Does it have an odor when planed? \n4. Include multiple pictures or text info as sub-comments under a main picture, not as an avalanche of first-level comments.",

I've learned step one to not make furniture from big box lumber. :) I got this with a bunch of scrap wood I picked up off marketplace. . It's obviously dirty. But, besides does anyone know what wood this is, do I need to worry about fungus etc? I'm not used to not 'out of the box' wood. And, how do I clean this up to see more? I thought about just throwing a 80grit disk and testing an edge. But, I figured I'd check here first. I can only post one, but it's like 18\"x5\"x4\". I can comment with another view. thanks!!! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usbetfjb7xuc1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85083ade5cc96d432af935999ba6ee7cf6dc8bdc",

But the club also has some trophy plaques on the wall, and I'd like to use something that'll look at least in the same family.\n\nTheir current wall plaques look like http://kirk-matz.com/Product/perpetual-wall-boards/hbkm-lv-3975x-295/894163. (I think they actually are Kirk & Matz.)\n\nThe color kind of looks like Walnut, but there's no figuring or prominent grain so it really doesn't look like walnut.

Kept asking us for more money for materials, and I'm trying to call him out on his complete BS. They are each about 5.5 inches long maybe 1.25 inch wide, one side feels laminated and the other side is rough but has two thin grooves from where it looks like a metal wire was burnt into it. Most pieces are tongue and tongue, but one of the pieces he left has tongue and tongue on the top and bottom but also a groove on the side.\n\nP.s. he's asking $700 for a job that he didn't finish but he only used maybe 20 of these and he did a shit job with it and simply nailed them into the larger timbers to \"cover up\" the wood rot. He did nothing to remove or solidify or seal it. But that's not really important; I just want to know what these are called.

He said the beam was from a section he was able to salvage out of an old barn that had to be torn down on his property.\n\nHe asked me if I knew what the species was as I noticed the small growth rings on the end.  He thought the tree might have been 150 yrs old.  He cleaned the wood (no stain) and a couple coats of poly.

            "This sideboard is my first \u201ereal\u201d furniture project and was built from pre-laminated oak boards from Osmo. After weeks of on-off-work on this project I can safely say, that I will never build anything out of this material again. The wood had a lot of little cracks that needed to be filled in a time consuming process and there was way to much sapwood in it, that additionally had a few bug holes. It should normally been kiln-dried prior to any sale, but I did not want to go with any risk, so I fumed everything after assembly. I was not satisfied with the look of this sapwood-heartwood-mess so I painted the outer surface black. My original intend was to texturize the front panels of the drawers by carving to give this furniture a bit of individuality but I decided against it and made the middle section a compartment for the amplifier. The drawers got undermounted push-to-open slides.\n\nFor the finish I mixed Linseed-oil and Carnauba-wax by heating the oil and applied it while it was still hot. I buffed the mixture in with a towel and a hot air gun and wiped the excess off with fresh towels. I am not really satisfied with the outcome but learned a lot in the process of building and it will still be a perfect piece to store all my future vinyls in.",
            "Looks great! Nice work. \n\nOne thing to watch out for is that amplifier (?) should have more breathing room or it can over heat. I have a similar setup and I bought some cooling fans like you have in a desktop computer. Place them on top of the unit. They can be activated with a temperature sensor so they will turn on automatically and you don\u2019t have to think about it. Very quiet and I hardly know they\u2019re there.",

            "chill out, your amp is okay. Looks like you have more than an inch. Convection and the open front back are enough. Unless it is a tube amp, MosFETs are okay with an inch with open front back too.",
            "That\u2019s why I wrote \u201cwatch for\u201d and not \u201cyour amp WILL catch fire\u201d. Just put your hand on it and if it\u2019s hot, consider cooling. Or read the manual and see what it says about ventilation.\n\nI have a Parasound A23 with. MOSFET driver stage and it runs hot. Manual makes a big deal about ventilation. I don\u2019t know what model the OP has but I recommend checking for heat.",
