A group of German police officers nearby very casually walk over, find the two fighting, rough them both up, then hog tie them. Then they proceeded to throw them in the back of the same police van next to each other and went back and stood where they were before like nothing happened. \n\nI always wondered the conversation between those two in the back of the van. It was still there an hour later on our way back to our house.",

So are protestors, who cops everywhere like to fuck up. Massive street parties, festivals, concerts...lots of cops, with lots of experience, and a real taste for violence & crowd control.\n\nSource: been beat down by some Berlin cops. SPVM are similar. Totally different from, say, London cops, or NYPD.",
            "Nah they get extra support from other parts of the police force during these events. The ones you see here are most likely riot police and not really the same sort of guys who do regular patrols in Berlin.\n\nMost cops in Germany are actually pretty nice and people really don't see them as a threat or are scared of them like in the US. I really wouldn't fuck with the guys in full gear though. Their job is to swiftly shut shit down and that doesn't attract the most mild mannered of people.",

            "Neither does regular police in Germany. In general German police is very chill and doesn't care that much even if someone is a drunk asshole. But this isn't regular police. This is the Hundertschaft. Basically the attack dogs which are only deployed to riots or when mass violence is expected. And there have been issues with them being overaggressive or even violent. Of course questions in regards to accountability also come up from time to time.",
            "At Euro 2004 it was notable that the Dutch police were super chill and there was no crowd trouble, the Belgian police behaved like stormtroopers and there were running battles with fans at multiple cities.",

            "I suspect that the number that cat is much less though. All of those registered users, almost none will carry, since it\u2019s illegal Perry much all the time. Unregistered users will carry more often, but that is probably still a lot less than 1%.",
            "To be fair, the core of the issue is heavily influenced by the \"carrying\" part. \n\nOpen or concealed carry is illegal in most of Europe as far as I know, in the vast majority of instances(hunting season tends to have certain exceptions). So if someone ever walks down the street with a visible gun, cops with guns show up pretty quick. \n\nUnless you're out in the countryside or in certain criminal circles.",
            "The latter is definitely true. I don\u2019t know about the former.",

            ">If they didn't want to be made fun of they shouldn't to have lost two world wars and used humans as play things.\n\nAh yes, because no other nation has ever done anything wrong ever. Next time I will see an American, I will call him a slave owner and then see how he likes it. You are pathetic calling random people Nazis.",

And it's not like living in a different country erases yout ethnicity. You are born with it",
            "Okay Colonizer.  \nYou live on stolen land that you took by force from natives you genocided, if anyone should be made fun of it's you",
            "But look at how the cop who got hit does it: he knocks the guy down then is trying to get his hands so he can cuff him. In the US he'd kneel on his neck and punch him repeatedly in the face while the other cops got in kicks and hits with clubs. These Germans are being nice, he's getting subdued and arrested. In the US you will wind up hurt in purpose, and healthcare here is unaffordable.",
            "I don\u2019t hear you actually complaining about it. Sounds like you got what you deserved.",
            ">The ones you see here are most likely riot police and not really the same sort of guys who do regular patrols in Berlin.\n\nI have to think of the song a german comedian once made.\n\n\"...Beopo aus Bayern, Bepo aus Sachsen, kommen im VW bus, brechen dir beppo die Haxen..\"\n\n\"...Unit from Bavaria, Unit from Saxony, coming with the VW bus and break your legs police style..\"",
            "I wouldn\u2019t fuck with any German cop because I have huge respect for the overwhelming majority of them.\n\nI won\u2019t even look in the direction of the U.S. cop, because I have absolutely no respect for the overwhelming majority of them. \n\nMost cops reading a statement like that would say, \u201cGreat; that\u2019s the way I want it.\u201d  And them saying that absolutely fucking proves my point that I shouldn\u2019t have any true respect for most of them.  Fear, yes\u2014but respect? Not so much.",
            "Its super simple psychology\nTreat people in a relaxed manner and they are way less likely to escalate.\nAlso,\nRelaxed =/= unaware",
            "If you cause millions of euros in damages at a \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest you deserve a little beating.",
            "Those protesters got cracked down upon because they started digging up the road, vandalising property and ancient academic buildings and setting up barricades. They got told to leave, they refused. They got warned that they would be forcibly removed, they stayed. Then the police came in and cleaned them up. Whiel this was happening they were also harassing mutliple journalists. They whine about the right to protest but at the same time prevent people access to academia and infringe on the freedom of press. \n\nThe next day they entered the buildings of the UvA and some of them started vandalising the buildings from inside, including smashing coffee machines, plundering vending machines and smashing tvs and momitors, while painting graffiti on the walls and barricading themeslves in with the property of thr university. Thr police asked them to leave, they didn't, then the pokice cleaned out the outside of the building. After which the people barricaded inside decided to leave after some time and they got out peacefully. \n\nThere is a lot of context to these situations and there is a clear line of causality as to when police violence is used, and it's clear it only is used after they started demolishing the place and refused to leave and got warned.",
            "You didn\u2019t give any statistics. You just dog whistled like a racist little prick.",
            "You are disappointment to grammar you little racist pleb",
            "Well, that or a knife.",
            "Because a gun is the only thing that can kill you, right?",

            "If you live in a state that still waves Confederate flags around, yes. By all means call them racists, and slave owners. Shame them into never waving that flag again.\n\nThat's one thing that Germans really got right. Banning the Nazi flag. Some \"people\" in America don't understand how shameful it is to wave it. And whta losers they are.",
            "This.  A German cop generally just wants to restore peace and order using the minimum required use of force.  \n\nBut why too many U.S. cops don\u2019t even think about minimizing use of force, because they know their unions and their coworkers will back them whether they were in the wrong or not.",
            "They ( usual ) give plenty of warnings to move and get out of the way.  \nIf one persists in staying there, and keep up annoyingly or aggressively - well, it's fuck around and find out",
            "Are you only good at insulting? Typical. Pathetic and childish. Start crying",
            "Plz cry more",
            "Nope, even a pencil can kill you and we had a gruesome and tragic death of an police officer about 2 weaks ago here in germany... but a gun is the easyest way. The officers wear vests against knives and its more dificult to kill someone with a knive, than with a gun because of Distance.",
            ">That's one thing that Germans really got right. Banning the Nazi flag.\n\nIndeed, Germany has put a lot of effort into denazifying itself, so calling random people out for an event that happened 40-50 years before they were born is shameful.",
            "No, the difference is a german cop CANNOT use extensive force and get away with it, there is no \"bodycam was off\" or a police union protecting him, he will get suspended, he wont see any pay, he will never hold a job again.",
            "Exactly.",
            "From my perspective, you're having a bit of a breakdown. Perhaps go back to the start and re-read the posts one by one.",

            "You're telling me to not bring a gun to a pencil fight?",
            "Yeah, I know that case, his useless colleagues didn't do anything, one policewoman even ran away... Now imagine things like this happened often. You'd see even German cops started using their guns more and more.\n\nThe most hilarious thing is that your government is now seriously proposing even more serious restrictions on knives. :D",
            "Not only in denazifying but in being open about their mistakes, facing it and dealing with it.  They haven't shied away from it or tried to kick it under the carpet because it's easier to do.   Massive respect for how they go about it.    \n\nWhich makes calling them Nazis even more fucking stupid.  They are more on-top of dealing with that shit than anyone.",
            "Don't forget the intensive training they get even before wearing a uniform.  \nOnly when you are psychological and physical fit, you'll get to roam the streets.\n\nNot like the US, where in many places anyone breathing gets a badge",
            "The saying is: the pencil is mightyier than the sword. It says nothing about a handgun. We have to elaborate \ud83e\udd14",
            "The critical distance for knive attacks is 9m, that is what it makes them so dangerous. But in the US, the cops must fear to get shot at any moment out of cars, clothes, closed doors etc. The feel of thread for cops is insanly high and Increases the aggressive potential many times right at the beginning.",
            "Yes, while France refused to apologise for their colonial atrocities, Germany is very open about the Holocaust and overall about the Nazi times. They have a bunch of monuments dedicated to the victims and they have those little copper plates on streets that show where those victims lived. German police takes the Nazi issue very seriously as well, there are videos of people getting immediately arrested after doing a Nazi salute. This is something no other country has really done, they either openly deny genocides like Russia and Turkey, or they mentioned in some official statement that they are sorry like once or twice."
