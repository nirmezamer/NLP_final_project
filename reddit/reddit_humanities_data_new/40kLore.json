You know something is really wrong when Commissar actually tries to be reasonable or Inquisition itself tries to avoid few problems related to Krieg. *A Krieg team once coordinated almost instantly to force an invulnerable/phasing Canoptek Wraith into melee-combat (so that it would engage its phase-out protocols to become vulnerable) and then the rest of the team shot the everliving sh\\*\\*t out of their charging-comrades and the machine to death, didnt even blink.*\n\nAs a fear bonus but not regiment, seeing the lonesome Eversor Assassin wandering amongst the ruins and friendly/enemy corpses means you are fu\\*\\*ed beyond measurement.

They place little value on individual lives other than how much damage they can cause to their enemies at an acceptable Kill-to-Death ratio for the success of their campaign. They have no qualms strapping bombs to their chests and charging trenches or Traitor Astartes, or using chemical and biological weapons. They used them on their own damn planet. Atomics too. They don't care about civilian casualties. They're probably the only Imperial Guard Tithe Planet that trains as rigorously as Cadians.\n\nAnd they have shovels.\n\nHowever, if a Catachan deployment includes Sly Marbo, then Catachans are scarier. By far.\n\nEDIT: Honorable mention for the Solar Auxilia. I'm not sure if they're technically Guardsmen or not, but if you're a baseline human you're losing. They're trained specifically for defending Terra and the Sol system against everything that could threaten the Homeworld.

It\u2019s happened on several occasions, such as with the Ultramarines 2nd company on Damnos or with the M32 Battle of the Fang on Fenris.\n\nI believe the Iron Hands also had one of their clan-companies permanently led by a Dreadnought at one point, who simply didn\u2019t go to sleep like normal dreads and retained his captaincy",

Sometimes it\u2019s even hinted they\u2019re in constant pain, or have phantom sensations. I believe the justification for the Iron Hands one was that as a senior captain he was already mostly machine, so being interred in a dreadnought coffin wasn\u2019t a big deal for him.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons chaos dreadnoughts inevitably rapidly succumb to insanity.\n\nSleeping between battles, when they have something to focus all their attention on, is usually presented as a mercy to a once-proud warrior reduce to an armoured coffin. The downside is they start to forget and get \u201cfoggy\u201d the longer they live and the longer they\u2019re kept in stasis. It also gets progressively more difficult to wake up Dreadnoughts as they age because of this",
            "An additional risk to Blood Angels dreadnoughts, according to the game Battle Sector, is that the loss of self/willpower and exhaustion can cause a BA dreadnought to fall to the Black Rage.
