            "The only bit I enjoyed was the extended scene of RuPaul slapping every person on set.",
            "not Bruno approaching RuPaul so cheerfully and still getting The Slap \ud83d\ude2d",
            "With them bringing in Bob, Monet and Raven so far. I was fully expecting Asia to show up on that slapping scene referencing her actually getting slapped by Ru on S10.",
            "Acting challenges are not my favorite, because of the terrible scripts, but this was just crazy. Eight similar scenes in a row with Ru and the queen acting just standing there and never looking at each other. Nina did ok and Jorgeous\u2019s wig was fun, but otherwise it was unwatchable.",
            "How does Roxxy have the nerve (delusion) to say Angie was being too dramatic with the snippers after all that nonsense she pulled last week?!",
            "The camera angle made it so clear that they were reading all the dialogues. That on top of the challenge just dragging on really made this a difficult watch",
            "As bad as the acting challenge was, the extended slapping scene did make me lol when Raven turned up.",
            "It suffered by the challenge requiring each to have their own scene with Ru, playing very similar characters and all slaps. If there were half as many queens it wouldn\u2019t have been so repetitive.\n\nI did think Angie was the correct winner.",
            "The challenge was good in theory but in execution it went on and on lmfao the filming process though  was fun to see",
            "Beautiful gowns",
            "It was funny-ish for the first queen , then maybe angie but then they each just kept coming one after the other doing the same kinda stupid lines and slaps it got REALLY boring REALLY quick \ud83d\ude02 they should have maybe done this in pairs or trios or something \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "Everyone felt so disconnected",
            "Plastique\u2019s dress was gorgeous, but I feel like I\u2019m missing how it fit the theme.",
            "After watching this season, more than ever bring back All-stars to the 3-4 year gap olympics format. Do that challenge, otherwise the format is doomed",
            "They should\u2019ve just done one big acting challenge, this was a tough one to watch. I still don\u2019t even really know who did the best\ud83d\ude02",
            "And the winner of this weeks challenge is.. RuPaul!",
            "This acting challenge felt so awkward, and I say this as a dinosaur who has actually watched the movies referenced.. it just got a bit much to watch the same scene over and over and it highlighted that Ru is not exactly an actress \ud83e\udd2d\nAlso the need to randomly add famous quotes from the same movie that were not relevant to that scene made it all more insane \ud83d\ude04 \n\nI will say, casting Jorgeous as Harold was pretty amusing  considering how much she smokes, and when she ran for the chair it was quite funny!\n\nAngeria was, of course, the funniest and I think it's more down to her than to the script.\n\nPlastique and Shannel looked so gorgeous on the runway! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nI think this was Angeria's best lipsync on DR ( and Nina's most entertaining one) buuuut....sorry, Kandy and MKD did it better! \n\nPlastique 's logic actually makes sense and GottMik was, sadly for her, a sensible choice for blocking since there's so much she does well.\n\nI'm still rooting for Shannel but at this point her best hope is that they're holding off any reward to the semifinal where a twist gives  her 3 bagdes\ud83e\udd1e",
            "ok watching the episode now, got to jorgeous.... they way they all do the s16 finale rupaul stand there, never looking at ru is so distracting lol while ru stands at the same angle but DOES look at the girls like wtf hahah\n\nalso wow, the quality of the bits kept deteriorating the more it want on, a huge dip with shannel lol\n\n  \nok watched till the end. vanjie was vanjie once again lol \n\nthe ending bit with the eye cover and ru slapping everyone and their grandma was the highlight. \n\nnina and roxxxy were the best imo! hope they're in the top",
            "I feel none of the queens themselves are enjoying the season. Apart from Vangie who is just being Vangie. Angeria came with a lot of good energy, but the vibes from the other girls are bringing her down.\n\nThe only positive outcome of this season would be Angie getting the crown.\n\nOn a side note- Its nice to see Plastique and Jorgeous come into their own and try having fun in challenges they would maybe struggle before.",
            "The endless slapping scene could have been so much better if they brought it more random ensemble of people (i.e., children, Asia, Jan)",
            "When RuPaul eventually leaves drag race they\u2019re going to have the slap montage be the end of her farewell sizzle reel",
            "And not a laugh was uttered in the challenge",
            "After this season the girls are gonna be begging to be eliminated again.",
            "God that was tedious",
            "Omg I acto liked this episode I\u2019m surprised Reddit didn\u2019t",
            "This episode was rotted.",
            "The challenge was really high camp but I couldn\u2019t get over everyone looking past Ru and the camera, probably at a teleprompter(?). Plus most of them went on for too long for me but there were definitely good moments. I was kinda hoping for Jorgeous to snag another win.\n\nSuuuper excited for the design challenge next week. Hoping for a Roxxxy and Plastique win. At this point I\u2019m pretty Team Roxxxy for the crown but I\u2019d love if Plastique won and I\u2019d be happy with Angie as well. Easily my top 3 of the season and make it so much more entertaining",
            "We have to retire mommy dearest stuff cuz it\u2019s \ud83d\udca4 now",
            "The only thing that would kinda salvage this season is if Angeria won",
            "No more uncalled for reveals and no more words on outfits (Nina).  Enough!",
            "I know I\u2019m in the minority cuz I enjoy the acting challenges (usually), but this was painful. Definitely no laughs. I truly can\u2019t understand this decision to have them all do similar individual scenes here one right after the other. Some of the better acting challenges are because of the queens interactions with one another. \n\nThe best in my mind were Nina and Gottmik, but yeah, Mik is in a weird spot now after last week. Initially I was like, \u201coh, people are just looking for things to be upset about, queens are stealing material all the time,\u201d but then I saw the side by side routines. Rough.",
            "Am I being craxy? My friend and I actually enjoyed this acting challenge a lot more than normally.",
            "Yawn.",
            "I was really liking the episode and the runways until the challenge started, that was rough to watch. Probably one of the worst All-Stars challenges, who thought this was a good idea. This season is really going down the drain",
            "thoughts: \n\nvanjie bores me this season i forget shes competing\n\ngottmik was actually funny and had good lines\n\nshannels take was awkward\n\nplastique is adorable liking her a lot",
            "When is S17?",
            "can someone who knows how please set that Ru slapfest at the end to Gortoz A Ran from Black Hawk Down?",
            "Holy shit this episode sucked. I don't think I've hated watching a maxi challenge so much before. Doesn't help that I'm a bit over the season considering I was rooting for Gottmik up until last week.",
            "Is it just me or is this cast a little too into themselves?  There\u2019s something off putting about the level of overconfidence of some of these queens and the word \u201clegend\u201d sure has been thrown around a bit too heavily for my tastes.  Especially when it\u2019s used to describe some more mediocre fare here.  Being on one season of a tv show previously doesn\u2019t make a legend.\n\nAside from Shannel who almost seems insecure, and in a way that\u2019s refreshing and endearing tbh.  Especially in comparison to some queens who may have more followers but have no real artistic ability outside of having the means to buy other people\u2019s actual creative designs and artistry or outright stealing it.",
            "I'm not that invested anymore but kind of want Vanjie to win just for her to be in the hall of fame. I just find her so entertaining in anything she does and she has been looking so beautiful.",
            "Smh. This is.. something.",
            "I thought the acting challenge was ok, not bad. No one bombed at least. Angie, Nina and Ru slapping his team were the best parts.",
            "Gottmik and Roxxxy have been very annoying this season. They\u2019re both instigators and you can tell Angeria is over their bullshit",
            "That main challenge: unwatchable",
            "I keep seeing all kinds of complaints but I actually enjoyed this challenge. It was camp. Then again, I prefer acting challenges and am dreading next weeks design challenge because those bore me to tears every time. \n\nI think I\u2019m team Angie overall, but Nina was the clear winner of the lipsync, and I actually think the top two should\u2019ve been Nina and Jorgeous.",
            "I think Shanel and Jorgeous did the best. Am I delusional?",
            "Is it just me or are they reusing lip-sync songs time after time after time? Last week we had Be My Lover which Denali had already slaughtered on S13, now we get Lovergirl which was already done on season 7... Idk but it feels like lately they have been using the same songs on repeat not to mention the hundreds times we have had Sissy That Walk as a lip sync song.",
            "Are we ready to say this season is worse than all stars 1 yet?",
            "Not them feeding us the two worst all stars seasons with 1 one after another",
            "[removed]",
            "Horrible episode. Literally no chemistry",
            "i really thought gotmikk did rlly well this challenge!! but this only confirms the narrative someone said about them wanting angie to win the whole thing",
            "Yeah it looked like they were genuinely having fun. Very cute.",
            "It\u2019s always fun to see RuPaul get weird and go full camp.",
            "I also loved the black butta coffe ad in the intro!!",
            "That would've been gold!",
            "The snort that I snorted. Delusional or exceptionally good at reality TV? Both maybe?",
            "Okay but Roxxxy made it clear that she was just in her (delusional, twisted) feelings that day, as she\u2019s allowed to be. Like she said, she just needed to sleep it off and realise that it\u2019s NBD.",
            "The pot calling the kettle black: drag queen edition.  I loved it!",
            "Anytime there\u2019s an acting challenge on it\u2019s time to tune out for a bit and read something else until the runway starts",
            "They should have just done 2-3 different scenes.\n\nDoing the same scene 8 times in a row and watching them basically twice (one during filming it) was exhausting.",
            "I was in, and then it went on and on and on. \ud83d\ude34",
            "Thanks to drag race for always educating us. We saw the law of diminishing returns in action today \ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udd23",
            "From what I've seen it fits what someone from Vietnam would wear for mourning. I'd have to look again cause I was half asleep but I believe purple is a color they wear instead of black and it's more of what the woman would wear 'waiting for her husband to come back to her'",
            "Same",
            "Homegirl knows Ali Wong, so she's playing by her own rules this season...  Lip sync?  Nah.  Fit the runway prompt?  Only when I feel like it.",
            "100%.  \n  \nIt won\u2019t happen because it would mean less money for them, but it would seriously impact the quality of the seasons for the better.  \n  \nAll Stars kind of became a free-for-all, for whoever is willing to go for another round.",
            "they did this \u2018gap\u2019 once between as 1 and as2 when the show was low budget lol",
            "I mean.... Then stop watching it \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they're never going to slow down production if they pull consistent numbers. If you're watching, it doesn't matter if it's good, they're profiting.",
            "Me neither, because by about the fourth one through I was scrolling on my phone and just looking up occasionally.\n\nThe mini-challenge, OTOH, I was here for EVERY SECOND of!",
            "Thank goodness we\u2019ve only had one scripted acting challenge per season for a few years - they can\u2019t hurt us anymore \ud83d\ude02",
            "Ngl Jorgeous made me laugh with her wig & the chair, and Vanjie made me laugh with her dorky stripper dancing.",

            "Why?",
            "'Describe All Stars 9 in four words'",
            "I think at this point other than Showgirls all the references are dated. I mean, the most recent thing is from 30 years ago while the oldest thing is from 70 years ago. Surely to god there\u2019s something worth referencing from the last 2 decades?",
            "My adoration of Angeria has reached new heights",
            "I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the Roxxxy annotation disrupted",
            "This reveal at least both looked good",
            "Hey, she looked good this week!",
            "younameit she\u2019s FUCKED it",
            "I was one who thought Gottmik\u2019s roast was NBD and that she could be read for not having quite as good delivery as the other girls, but that it wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\nThen I watched the Nikki Glaser special for the first time last night and was like\u2026oof. As savvy as these queens are about how they\u2019ll be perceived by the fandom, I\u2019m pretty gagged that she did that. Did she not realize she\u2019d be called out for ripping off those jokes or did she think \u201cyeah someone will notice but I won\u2019t get read for it\u201d?",
            "Yeah, Gottmik's plagiarism was extremely disappointing.  No longer a fan.  And it didn't help that some queens clearly didn't even attempt to write their own jokes.",
            "say specifically who you wanna say. cause clearly you\u2019re referring to two queens in particular, say it.",
            "The overconfidence?\n\nShannel has been struggling about not having any badges yet, Jorgeous cried on stage about not being good enough, Nina literally went to the sewing challenge being like \"eh I know I'm bad\".\n\nAlso they're fucking drag queen ffs. Being overconfident is in the job description.",
            "Vanjie feels like Alyssa Edwards, in the way that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever be Drag Race winners, but they\u2019re easily in the top few most iconic rugirls.",
            "Lmao I\u2019m the exact opposite. I adore design challenges but acting challenges are always my nemesis \ud83d\udc80",
            "Yes",
            "Angeria deserved that win but Shanel and Jorgeous would have felt right also.",
            "You had two songs reused in a row after five songs no one lipsynced to and you are saying they are reusing songs time after time?",
            "A) I didn\u2019t even know Be My Lover was used before\n\nB) reusing songs that haven\u2019t been used in almost a decade or more is fine",
            "It's not",

            "AS8 is still worse than this one",

            "I could be wrong, but I thought white was worn at funerals in Vietnam.",
            "Exactly.\u00a0",
            "And it was the right decision.",
            "It wasn't a \"gap.\" All Stars was cancelled because AS1 sucked. They had to beg the network to bring it back based on the growing popularity of the main series. There will never be another \"gap\" unless All Stars is cancelled again. The fans need to get that through their heads and move on.",
            "Well, I am watching it so see if it gets better but nah. It's an on-going problem with the All-Stars format that I have been noticing since AS8. If every year there is an All-Stars, it ain't All-Stars no more. Regardless the numbers, they should figure out this because in the long term, it is going to be a hinderance and then the format would be so obnoxious by that point that we won't be able to go back to its original intent.",
            "There\u2019s been so much tension and drama and bad lip syncs. Also it\u2019s a joke.",
            "Same here, she's such an angel",
            "She's definitely not been winner material this season so far",
            "Roxxxy and Gottmik?",
            "There\u2019s definitely something for everyone, so I\u2019m glad you enjoy them. They\u2019ve never particularly interested me, but then I also think the runway is the worst part of each episode so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02",
            "Yep. Noticing it a lot recently on the show. There is a huge catalogue of music out there to choose from so we shouldn't be repeating songs.",
            "in my opinion its lazy",
            "It was purple/white so we might be both right? I literally saw a comment under a short showing just her and saw the comment before passing out. Give me a sec and I'll see if I can find it!",
            "Dr. Google says family members wear white and other attendees wear black. It\u2019s such a spectacular outfit that I\u2019m not mad at her about being off theme!",
            "I get the idea that the queens need more time to cook, but \u201cwe need 3-4 years gap between seasons\u201d (which happen once) is rediculous as the show makes lots of revenue every season they churn out +  new opportunity for returning rugirls. \n\nAlso imagine waiting 4 years and getting a szn like all stars 8 . Y\u2019all would be pressed like a paniniii",
            "It could be a gap, why not. The Olympics have one, the World Cup, etc. You can't call it the All-Stars of the Olympics of Drag if it takes place so often. If they wanna push that format on, they should renamed it Redemption or Second Chance season.",
            "They might have been paid to be there and not care. I think its more some viewers who are bothered than the girls. Like, i think you are saying that you want eliminations back.",
            "She\u2019s performed well every week except snatch game. She\u2019s def not the runway queen of the season but her only real flop has been \u201catomic blonde\u201d. I\u2019d be fine with a Roxxxy win if she stays consistent.",
            "https://youtube.com/shorts/AJg8xIByKEc?si=NUNeVEwKjL6SWj46 FOUND IT! And it was the second comment\n\n\"The people here that saying this doesn't fit the theme needs to learn more about culture lolll it represents the Widow waiting for her husband. That is a traditional bridal dress along with beautiful purple theme all over. Hence the theme. Even the makeup does the tear dripping effect Purple color in Vietnamese culture go along with sadness and remembrance and longing. \"S\u1ea7u t\u00edm\" you can do some more research about the culture before saying ignorant stuff... Widow doesn't always mean black dress, scornful women. Other parts of the world also have Widows... Not only American.\"",
            "I can guarantee you that if an All-Stars take place every 4 years, every non-winner Queen would LOVE to come back to compete so 1. They would choose the best of the best as in AS1 and AS2. 2. The Chosen Queens would give their best",
            "Instead of more time to cook (that too!) \n\nI think it\u2019s good to keep including some queens from seasons further back - which they DID do with for eg Jessica Wild & Shannel.\n\nMaybe a little more of this.  Cos lots of queens haven\u2019t even been on once.",
