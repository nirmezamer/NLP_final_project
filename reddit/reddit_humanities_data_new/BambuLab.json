            "Just so everyone is aware. Previous prices were cheaper for up to 3 rolls.\n\nEdit: corrected a typo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnj4q3c92r4d1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a0e5d2c65ceb36abd62c055c07f5266e061093f",

            "In for an A1 mini, will be perfect for when my P1S is busy",

            "just ordered a x1c\ud83d\ude0d\nhope arrives quickly",
            "Remember Bambulabs has a big event later this month where they will likely roll out the next line of printers and the sale will be going for a full month. \n\nDon't jump on these \"deals\" just yet, wait until after the event/announcement as the sale will still be going and then decide.  No one wants to buy a last gen printer days before the next gen releases!",

The \"[0.2mm/0.4mm/0.6mm Hotends Kit - A1 Series](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-series-hotends-kit?variant=41581106135176)\" is only 21% off when purchased with the printer. However, you can purchase the three accessories independently for 35% off instead, saving yourself money. This also lets you choose which hotends you want, instead of being stuck with the 0,2/0.4/0.6 in the kit.\n\n  \nI did not notice this in time for my order, but hopefully someone else can benefit.",
            "Bought the P1S combo! Good bye Ender 3 Neo. Anyone add recommendations for someone new to Bambu?",
            "I thought this was supposed to be the \"biggest\" sale ever (or that's how it was hyped up to be).\n\nBlack Friday 2023 X1C w/AMS was $1299 plus two free filament. Now its $1299, no extra filament.\n\nSeems like a similar sale but certainly not \"biggest\".",

            "Even though I have survived -and could survive - without the AMS for my P1S, I just pulled the trigger since it's the first time it's ever been on sale.   My printer is 2 floors below my office, so I'm just trying to save some time not having to run up and down the stairs.  I'll be putting it next to the printer, as I don't have enough clearance to put it on top.",
            "Also worth noting microcenter has the sale prices aswell",

            "I have really been enjoying my 300x300 non-Bambu printer for the past couple of months, but I have been curious about the multi-color capabilities through Bambu and was totally ready to get the A1 Mini Combo, but with the price of the full-size A1 Combo, it was a no brainer to just spend the extra bit of cash now rather than regret not having the extra build volume later.  Fingers crossed that I like this at least as much as the other machine!",
            "Vouchers and codes all work with this. Had enough points for the LED lamp kit, so got one of those, a smooth PEI bed and a 0.4mm hardened nozzle for my A1 all for less than the usual price of the bed alone.",
            "When adding the printer to the cart with attached discount accessories, the discount is no longer applied in the cart. I still purchased, but wish I would have received the discount on filament and hot ends.",
            "And I now have two more ams on order. I hate you. \n\n\nThank you",

            "Timely sales, I wanted to buy for a few weeks : Went on with X1C + AMS + 2 spools of filament + smooth plate + 2 sets of nozzles + swatches + glue stick.\n\nLooking forward to the Bambu experience",
            "Looking to order this up today... question is... should I order directly from Bambulab or get it at Microcenter locally? Assuming no extra Insider discount and shipping time is not an issue. Any reason to order directly vs Microcenter? Does ordering direct have better service or warranty service etc?",
            "Just bough an A1 mini with an AMS lite and a .2mm nozzle for the a1 mini. My bank account does not like me.",

            "I was like 4 months ago to pull the trigger. I said... I don't need it, I don't need it. It last until tomorrow I saw the offer and... That it",

In the screenshot above, 8 spools of filament in the cart is not qualifying for the top tier discount because one of the spools is Glow filament.",
            "I have a 10% rotor voucher I have been sitting on that looks like it only stacks with printers. I don't need another printer so DM me and I'll randomly pick someone to send it to.",

[Click here to submit your application.](https://support.bambulab.com/en/activity?activeCode=8a6nje5mqwhjw16caoex) Please note that the price adjustment applies only to printers/AMS.\n\nThis does give you the difference back on a gift card.",

            "I ordered the p1s combo. wish i would have ordered the ams separate to save an extra 50 bucks. :(",
            "Just used my $120 A1 credit on more filament and a .2mm nozzle",
            "Bought about $800 in stuff! Two AMS units, filament, and some extra nozzles! Shame a lot of the build plates were sold out, but I'll get them later!",
            "Wish i was paying attention when i bought 8 spools yesterday, but I had been on the fence about getting a 2nd x1 carbon combo. $1,299 made it much easier to pull the trigger today.",
            "Well between the sale and some cards could get a second AMS for about $200\u2026. Hmmmm",
            "Finally got my wife open to it with the sale.\n\nNow the question is, if I tell her I'm getting the a1 mini but actually order the full a1 combo, will she notice...",
            "How long is this gonna last?",
            "Has anyone ordered from the EU store in the past few days? I ordered a P1S+AMS combo on Friday, but Bambu hasn't even handed over the package to the courier company (DHL) yet. What are the experiences, what kind of delivery times can be expected in the EU nowadays?",
            "Yay, now let me by filament, I don't even care if it's on sale or not, every PETG is out of stock :(",
            "Filament not being discounted in cart. Tried to buy 10 rolls of PLA",

            "adding the A1 Series Hotends Kit with the A1 and A1 Mini shows its non-discounted price, how to fix?",
            "I bought my A1 Combo 10 days ago, so I just missed the salde :(",
            "Are any of the other size hotends worth getting?\n\nBackground - been using .4 with the A1, 3D printer is mostly used for cosplay parts and smaller decorative trinket type pieces. Thanks in advance.",
            "Bought printers two A1 mini, and at last PETg translucent came back just in time",
            "Happy birthday! Thanks for making 3d printing fun for us \ud83e\udd17",
            "Got the AMS lite and a bunch of filament to go with it. I thought I would be fine with single color printing but I came quickly to realize that AMS is a huge help if only for not having to switch materials so often anytime I want to change a color/material. Was almost tempted to upgrade my 2 months old a1 mini to a x1 but I will wait for the next generation of printers from Bambu.",
            "Are the filament bundle prices permanent or only for this sale? Because it looks permanent to me (since there isn't any date on the filament page [https://eu.store.bambulab.com/pages/bambu-filament](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/pages/bambu-filament) )",
            "AMS for 189 shipped after a 150 coupon they issued from my X1C purchase two weeks ago. Not bad!",
            "Not sure if it\u2019s on my end or theirs, but certain sale pages are not loading great and are glitchy when I try to add to cart. On the US site. Like I select a specific color, but it adds a different color no matter what color is actually selected. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re getting slammed with purchases right now.",
            "Decided to bite the dust and bought the A1 + 2 PLAs fillaments + hotend kit. Didn't buy the AMS as I don't envisage doing multicolour printing. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.\n\nI wonder how long it will take for them to fullfill the orders.",
            "I\u2019m grateful for the sale, I just ordered my first printer from you all today!",
            "Really tough choice between P1S and A1. Full auto calibration and a nicer screen are pretty nice, while also being cheaper. Since I'm printing indoors, I have no interest in materials with more fumes.",
            "So this sell was kinda cool timing for me.  I have an A1, decided I wanted a AMS  was going to order that for $250.  Waited and got the A1 Mini and the AMS on this sale ($350),  so essentially I got the A1 mini for 100$ if my math is mathing.",
            "I have x1c but want a 2nd printer. Is p1s pretty comparable?",
            "I ordered mine :) (x4)",
            "You guys ran out of the plates :(",
            "Im planning to buy the A1 but im not sure if  I even need the combo becuase I never wanted to print multicolor so far. is this really such an upgrade from single color printing that its worth the money?",
            "Picked up a lithophane filament bundle, a 0.2 mm nozzle for my P1S, and 2 LED lamp kits.\n\nDebated on getting a hardened steel 0.4mm but I feel like I don't need it just yet.",
            "All I know is that the time it was supposed to start would be 4:00 PM local time for me. Apparently it actually started at 8:00 in the  morning.",
            "And we killed the store...",
            "And the AMS stays at 350 so it\u2019s gonna stay right where it is",
            "Site is down.",
            "Hope you get the US store back online soon ... as of 14:36EST it's a 504 Gateway Time-Out error.  Luckily was able to get my order in early this morning.",
            "And it's back up",
            "Still waiting for 2 months for my order of PLA - CF to be fulfilled.",
            "Considering either A1 or P1S. What would you recommend? How do they compare in printing quality? Noise doesn't matter for me, printing speed is secondary.",
            "filament doesn't seem to be on sale in CAD, doesn't show in the page, or the cart or even at the checkout screen",
            "Aaaarh - literally received my P1S Combo two days ago. Could have saved \u20ac200 compared to the Danish store price :'(\n\nStill - I'm already in love, and happy that I got the AMS also, so for anyone on the fence - it's a great product :-D",
            "I got a a1 mini combo last month and today I got 2 extra minis without the ams and a a1 combo. \n\nA month in and I own 4 printers - I was only supposed to buy 1 extra printer today",
            "Of course I ordered a printer 5 days ago",
            "Was eyeing an A1 mini, sale was the tipping point. Even though the filament was supposed to get discounted if you added it to your cart at the same time as the printer it wasn't so skipped that and will get some cheaper eSun stuff.",
            "I got an A1 mini and a x1c. Debating with my 150$ credit on either getting an A1 or another mini",
            "I am new to 3d printing. I am looking at P1S Combo as my starter machine. Do I need any add-ons or filament to start? Can filament be purchased elsewhere for a better price?",
            "So I've been planning to get the P1S combo, extra hotends, smooth PEI plate, and filament on this current sale. But I see the smooth PEI plate is out of stock.\n\nIf I want the 20% off plate discount, is my only choice to wait until it comes back in stock to then make it an addon to my P1S? I'm worried if I wait, then something else in my cart might go out of stock, and then it becomes impossible to get everything I'm looking to get in one cart/order. Any insight?",
            "Just a heads up if you purchased from microcenter before this sale, you can reach out for them for price protection if you're still within the return window\n\nI purchased a p1s ams for $950 three weeks ago and got adjusted down to the $850",
            "Quick question, the sale says it's going until July 5th; I plan on ordering an A1 on next wednesday. Will stock be in good shape? I just don't want this to end up being one of those sales where it lasts for a month but runs out of merch on like day 5.",
            "Finally checked out my cart when the sale started.  Now the impatient waiting begins.",
            "Has anyone recieved their \"credit\" that bought right before the sale?  If so, how did it come to you?",
            "I just bought my second Bambulabs Carbon X1. I wish I had a whole room dedicated to them. Now we just need to make them run faster.....",
            "Any plans to restock the AMS on the Canada store?",
            "Ugh, I missed getting another AMS. This is what I get for thinking \"bah thats probably not on sale\".\n\nNVM it's already back. I have now paid for my overpriced contraption to avoid walking over to my printer \ud83d\ude01",
            "After scouring reddit/YouTube, I am looking at the A1 Mini for my first printer. Unsure if I should spring for combo with the AMS Lite or just go with the printer itself for now. Anyone have insight here? I'm not sure I'd be doing multicolor printing right off the bat but seems like it might be worth it (especially given the sale) for later on.",
            "I had just ordered a ton of filament and a p1s before the sale, I regret everything",
            "Anyone Think this year Black friday Will be better than this sale? \n\nWanna get a p1s combo and Maybe a second ams\ud83d\ude06",

            "Saw this sale and picked up first 3d printer: A1 + AMS Lite",
            "anyway to get the AMS for the  same price as the combo? Made a mistake ordering just the P1S, now I kinda want the AMS but I got to do return and rebuy?",
            "Question for everyone, I'm wanting to get into 3D printing as a hobby and wanted to know what you would choose between getting the A1 + AMS or getting the P1S by itself? Trying to figure out what's the better buy without going too crazy on spending atm.",
            "I took this opportunity to finally give my P1P the AMS it deserves. I've had it for over a year now, it's a P1S at this point, I've done all the upgrades, except I have a printed enclosure because the conversion kit didn't exist when I got it.",
            "I just bought a P1S and I'm stoked. The sale convinced the wife since we are saving money by spending money \ud83d\ude02. Thanks!",
            "Does anyone know when the sale ends? Would love to add an A1 mini but I have to wait for my next paycheck.",
            "Why is the shipping for the P1s combo $200 while the A1 combo $55?",
            "Will they restock filaments on spools before the end of the sale. I really want to round out my pla colors. What a bummer that so many filament with spools are out of stock",
            "Yeah too cool as I already bought an a1 mini and ams. Just now I ordered the a1 as I already have the ams.  Very impress. Thanks bambu",
            "Can anyone help me figure out the sale on the nozzles for the A1 series?  As in, are they on sale?  What's the normal price for them?  Just got our printer, and I'm thinking I should upgrade to the hardened steel instead of stainless (when it's back in stock).",
            "Anyone else think they will announce their new printer as soon as this sale ends? I'm looking to upgrade from a modified ender 3 to a PS1 Combo and it might suck if they release their new model as soon as the sale ends :)",

            "Do it...do it...do it! ;p\nI just purchased for 700\u20ac. I bought a second AMS, filaments and extra nozzles. Couldn't help myself. \nAlready had that AMS hub installed on my X1C. That hub was calling out to me to feed it. It said: \"I feel empty. I need more!\" True story.\n\nAnd I purchased 20kg of Sunlu hs-pla for prototyping and pair of birkenstock army green knockoff sandals (why not) yesterday on Ali for 200\u20ac. \n\nAlso just purchased 2 dual high temp/engineering plates on a 3rd party store as I see they are not listed in the eu store. They're gone? I love the engineering plate for petg and engineering filaments. The cool and high temp sides are garbage. I'm still not happy they got rid of tough pla and now this.\n\nWell, I'm almost 1000\u20ac lighter this month.

Yes, if you were only planning on getting 2-3 rolls then it's more expensive now but if you get 4+ rolls, like you did, you have saved more per roll than ever before, so even when buying 4-7 rolls it's a great discount. For comparison the other brand I personally buy is eSUN and the lowest I've found their filament is \u20ac15, but generally they are more around the \u20ac17 when buying multiple rolls, so Bambu filament is now around the same price.\n\nNot sure why you are so fixated on getting 3 rolls because let's be honest, buying a 4th roll isn't that big of a deal since we all know it will be used eventually. Also you do realize that this 4th roll only costs you \u20ac8, right? With the old discount when buying 3 rolls you'd have paid \u20ac60 in total, with the current discount when buying 4 rolls you're paying \u20ac68.\n\nBambu Lab is a relatively new company so they have been trying things out and changing things every now and then, so yeah, changes like this have happened before but it generally is always for the better (except the points on MakerWorld, but we all knew that was going to happen anyway, it wasn't sustainable)  \nOr at least that is my experience so far with them, I've been using their stuff for almost a year now.",

But that is not what I was trying to say, what I'm saying is that I wouldn't use the add-ons discount on the page of the printer itself right now, instead use the current anniversary sale discount page and buy 3 accessories (build plates, hot ends, etc) and you get 35% off instead of only 20%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/so20o9z1rr4d1.jpeg?width=1570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6251ae9ccfea7d4a9a24ae7aa8e439939d75b488",

            "I found it and only received $70, both the A1 Combo but with filament and one head",
            "Hmm probably user error then.",
            "P1s can handle all the same materials after you add a hardened nozzle and hardened extruder gears.\n\nThe X1C give you a nicer touch screen interface, LIDAR for flow calibration/first layer checks, and 10 degrees higher on the hotbed.\n\nManual flow calibration will give better results than LIDAR, I've never had the LIDAR correctly pick up a bad first layer, and the 10 degrees is not necessary for any materials I have used (including PA6CF and ASA).",
            "I think this is a no-brainer to be honest, I'd get the P1S combo and A1.\n\nThe X1C to my knowledge has just the LIDAR and slightly higher bed temps, but neither are really needed for any specific filaments as far as I am aware. Having the LIDAR is certainly not better than having another printer, imo. Another difference is the hardened steel nozzle and extruder gears, but those are easily replaced if you need them on the P1S and are way cheaper.\n\nI have the P1S and A1 Mini and for PLA at least (haven't tried other filaments yet) I already prefer using my A1 Mini because of the \"Active Flow Rate Compensation\" alone. On top of that it also wastes a lot less filament when starting a print (single colour). I still love my P1S, but it's very obvious that the A1 is a newer machine.\n\nIn all honesty, if you don't actually need an enclosure or don't need to be able to print in more than 4 colours in a single print (or connect multiple AMS to one printer) I'd just get the A1, or two...\n\n  \nEdit: Oh yeah, and the screen is also different, but I just use my phone for the P1S, which works really well anyway.",
            "I just submitted the form, should get the gift card within 3 days. Thank you very much",
            "If you have a fully assembled hot end, fan, wires, etc its a 2 min job to switch them.",

            "I think the P1S is a much better printer. It\u2019s faster and the prints seem nicer. But the A1 seems to do everything basic I need and it\u2019s super easy to change heads on it.",
            "Well, it\u2019s not full spools, but 500 grams each. And you\u2019ll be surprised how fast a Bambu machine chews through filament. I really doubt those three spools will last you all summer long. ;)\n\nAnd nah, even on sale their filament is still hilariously overpriced.",
            "I assume it works for anything in the sale.  Why not ask?",
            "Oh sorry, I should have just said when it runs till. It was in quite small print. I saw the run time somewhere else, and might have missed it here too.\u00a0",

            "It works nicely with AMS Lite without having to worry about the spools\u2019 hole diameter. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve not had any issues with my spools or refills. \n\nI normally buy at least 4 rolls/refills at a time so for me it\u2019s $17.99 (roll) or $14.99 refill. Esun and sunlu and the like are $12-$15. For me it\u2019s worth the extra couple $ for the peace of mind.",
            "BL filaments are meant to be easier to use with BL printers at an upcharge. \n\nBL has already made profiles and tuned for the filaments they sell to be easier to the average consumer to use, which makes sense why it's upcharged a bit. \n\nIf you buy from Sunlu or any other comparable company, there's a chance you'll need to tune the filament for the best results.\n\nI've only ever used the sample BL filament included with printers, so I'm not the most experienced with their filament, but the upcharge does make sense.",
            "To be frank, there are tons of other options out there that are the same or better in terms of quality. A lot of people quote them daily in the sub. I just bought them because I liked some of the tones and I am repeating colours for one project.\n\nAdditionally, by the end of the day, their own spools fit perfectly in the ams lite and I don't have much time to respool other brands nor want to change a broken piece (sone ams spares are expensive).\n\nAlso wanted to try  translucent PETG and bambu tends to work easy and well with their own filaments on  the first try.\n\nBut really, there are lots of options out there.",
            "To be frank, my original post wasn't a complaint at all and as you said, ended up buying the 4th.\n\nBut why would I want to buy 3 instead of 4 is absolutely nothing of your interest. It might be because of money, as in \"my monthly budget is XX and don't want to invest more\". It might be available space in a small home, that my rolls are full and don't need another one, it might be that I have a fixation with prime numbers below 4. \n\nThose would be my problems and only mine. My buying habits, as much strange as they might appear, are my problem. But informing people that 2 and 3 rolls were cheaper before is not a problem. Just some information.",
            "To be fair, I've seen so many posts about buying 10+ rolls for 100\u20ac and complains about how you cannot be reliable without buying in bulk that I suppose they are after that market. The big roll eaters.\n\nThe 3 roll free shipping could not be what they are after now. Another thing that could be is that they are making bank for a big component getting into production and want to get fast money. I don't know.",
            "Do you cook?",
            "that can't be true. They're just opening up one in the Bay Area by end of year.",

            "Enjoy it, my friend!",
            "Gotta save money! So you can spend it on filament!",
            "Yeah, my first foray was an Ender 3 as well because I thought I could get by being technically inclined with a budget printer I got open box on eBay but that thing sucked and wouldn't even print properly once so I just sent it back. Bambu printers compared to that old garbage are night and day better.",
            "Well we have the sale going until July 5th which will be after the event, so still plenty of time to grab one of the existing on sale if they don't announce anything new or if it's going to be months before it releases after announcing it. \n\nNo reason to rush unless you just really want a new toy now ;)",

            "If my previous message was a reply to your original post then this would be a very fair answer, but it isn't. You're talking about bad luck and Rosemourne about the carpet being pulled out from under them and being bitter... that's what I'm reacting to.  \n  \n  \nTo be frank I really couldn't care less if you buy 3 instead of 4 rolls, I just wanted to make clear that the complaining about it is rather silly, IMO.  \n  \n  \nI'm going to leave it at this because it doesn't make sense to continue arguing with somebody who's being snarky.

The room with the most space is my kitchen. Oddly enough there was a free X1-sized space next to the oven. So I bolted an ikea bror to the wall and replaced the flimsy metal top with a custom kitchen countertop cutout to provide the machine with extra stability. Beneath it I've got space for filament/plates/tools/etc. I also mounted a [LPSH](https://makerworld.com/en/models/62784) system to the AMS so I can comfortably print TPU. It's not pretty, but it fits the space like a glove.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k7cu1neac5d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=783fbc8a3d3aeec013afd4e88ae762578d98fb88\n\n**#BambuLabWorkspace**",
