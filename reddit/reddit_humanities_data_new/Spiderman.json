            "Latest update shows they still need to raise about 2230 thousand more to pay for Dialysis sessions:                                                    \n\n> The MaGiC donut-hole\n\n> (Imagine Doug Henning said it, If you don\u2019t know Doug Henning, you are missing out on an amazing magician)\n\n> Peter is now over two months without a re-infection. This is very good news. He is working hard to recover what he has lost.\n\n> That is the end of my good news.\n\n> Apparently as of January 1, 2024, We have to pay out of pocket for Peter\u2019s Dialysis which he need to live.\n\n> It is an insurance morass that I am climbing through trying to get insurance to pick up the ball.\n\n> Just for a break down on the expense. One session is $743 (USD) and he needs three a week making it 2229 or say 2230 because it is easier for me to wrap my head around. I have been paying for it because I want Peter to live. But the well is dry and I haven\u2019t has much luck with the collectables recently.\n\n> I am coming to you and asking for your help which you have so graciously given us during the last year and three months.\n\n> Please give the Go Fund Me another blast you can say this is to pay for Peter\u2019s dialysis.\n\n> I will put another update and edit this one once I get everything back in hand.\n\n> I really didn\u2019t need this but here it is Happy New Year.\n\n> On a lighter note, Peter and I have been watching all the programs we like to watch together. He\u2019s not much for Project Runway or Ink Master and I am uninterested in beach volleyball and some procedural shows.\n\n> We have been enjoying \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d which airs after Colbert. It\u2019s a game show with comedians and a talk show with a game sort of kinda. But we have both laughed hard than we have in a very long time. He is caught up with Loki. We are working our way through \u201cWhat If-\u201cand the fourth season of \u201cMiss Scarlett and the Duke\u201d. \u201cCriminal Record\u201d is next.\n\n> We talk about conventions and fans. He is so very humbled and grateful for all you have done. You must understand that Peter came from the other side of the table. He was a fan before he was a pro. He would meet people he admired and told them so. He has autographs from that time. Overtime a number of those people have become his friends and admire his work as well.\n\n> He has been catching up on his comic book reading too.\nWe have been bouncing writing ideas between us.\n\n> It almost feels like we are back to the old normal but this is the new normal and I have a lot of muck to get through so I can stabilize the household",
            "How can someone like Peter David, who is responsible for so many iconic storylines and characters that both Marvel and DC have made hundreds of millions of dollars off of not afford something like this? The big two should be ashamed of what they've done to their creators.",
            "Hey everyone if you could help Peter and his family out please donate what you can. If you're unable to donate please help share and spread this among other communities!",
            "Man, why are all these talented people working for marvel always asking for money? Not saying this isn't a good cause, but I just see posts from then struggling with money too often.",
            "You know, ever since George Perez passed away it's been getting to me how little we hear about creators until their death, then Marvel and DC decide to post spreads \"honoring\" them, you'd think they'd attempt to raise money or just straight up pay for their medical needs instead of wait until they're gone to acknowledge their work. \n\nEvery single time I'm reading through issues I've been noticing more and more tributes, and sure some are of old age from natural causes, but others are younger who went far too soon.",
            "Wheres Marvel's take on this?",
            "Am very confused. Medicare guarantees payment for dialysis for this very reason. There was a specific law passed in the 1970s about this, because access to dialysis should not depend on ability to pay in the US. The hospital bills from his hospitalizations must be substantial however. Wishing him good health and best of luck.",
            "He somehow wrote a new 2099 book which starts next week so pick it up to support him!\u00a0",
            "Maybe this is when a massive company (Disney and marvel) can step in WITH fans and assist. The guy helped to create a super icon in 2099.",

            "I wonder why he doesn\u2019t have Medicare as dialysis patients are required to be on Medicare within 30 months of being on dialysis. Medicare covers 80% and private/employer insurance pays 20%. I did dialysis for 3 years, had a transplant, and a bilateral nephrectomy, all for the cost of my annual deductible. Also, the National Kidney Foundation offers [financial assistance](https://www.kidney.org/category/financial-assistance) and will cover the Medicare bill if you don\u2019t make enough money and the application takes about 30 minutes. Amazing that he could raise so much money for something federally covered by Medicare. Best of luck.",
            "Why in the world isn\u2019t Disney or Sony taking care of this? Peter also completely created Professor Hulk which the MCU used in their biggest movie. And he created Maestro which would be a great villain for the MCU.",
            "It may actually be cheaper to travel abroad for dialysis.  I know that may be difficult but dialysis in Mexico is about $550 a month.  That's a pretty huge mark down compared to the US.  That's what I'm doing to pay for cancer treatments since chemo in Mexico is cheaper than just the insurance cost in the US and their doctors are just as good. Wait times are much lower too.",
            "Damn bro, I literally started reading that 2 days ago :(",
            "That shame should extend to their parent companies. Disney and WB should be held responsible for this too.",
            "That literally boggles my mind, he co-created 2099, a character that went on to be the antagonist of a Spider-Man movie that grossed $690 mil but has to go to gofundme for medical assistance. No idea how these type of companies get away with that",
            "Paramount should be included too, because Peter's created some seminal additions to Star Trek's expanded universe.",
            "They are paid hourly and don't receive anything from the works they create. The money they get from Marvel doesn't even make up a majority of their income it comes from convention signings which they can't attend if they're hospitalized.",
            "Your poverty shaming is an embarrassment to Western civilization. It's ridiculous that you look down upon creators who are systemically underpaid. That you give facile 'solutions' to their serious and immediate economic and medical crises. Every 'question' you asked the OP is in fact an insult to belittle creators not being paid enough to live on and saying it's their own fault when inflation, reduced medical insurance coverage, a lack of royalties and residuals and increasing costs have made their lives difficult to impossible. \n\nI really hope that if you are ever in dire financial and medical crisis, people don't respond by telling you that they hear from people like you too often, that you should have found a different job, and that your problems are \"obvious\" and not worth anyone's compassion. \n\nThe reality is that Peter David earned a good amount of money at one point in his career until he lost half of his savings when his wife robbed the joint bank account and then squeezed him for the rest in a divorce, followed by several decades where inflation made his expenses higher while his page rate didn't rise to meet it as David found himself working as a freelancer for companies that went from providing living wages to very poor pay, even on an exclusive contract. David could survive as long as he was working and earning, but once he wasn't working and earning due to illness, he was in a bad situation.\n\nOf course, you don't care about any of that. You just want to declare that Peter David deserves to be sick and poor and unable to afford treatment because you want to claim people only suffer what they deserve. I hope no one ever speaks of you the way you have spoken of Peter David.",
            "Yeah especially since they used the character he co created and made millions of dollars off of him",
            "You see, this is something the affordable care act actually screwed up\n\nPrior to the passage of the ACA, anyone who needed dialysis, could get Medicare because it was a pre-existing condition, and they would be denied coverage .\n\nNow, he probably doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, because his income is too high, so he has to stay with normal insurance, and he has to get through the donut hole of noncoverage at some point every single year \n\nFun fact: the two largest dialysis corporations actually have programs to pay for health insurance for people to get them off of Medicare so that they can get higher payments from private insurance",
            "Just FYI, purchasing comics doesn't financially benefit anyone that worked on the book. I'm sure Peter David would be happy to hear you enjoying his work but if you want to support him specifically donate to the GoFundMe.",

As if... they're underpaid, or whatnot? \n\nIs that not a reasonable question?",
            "I don't sense any poverty shaming from these statements. He's highlighting the terrible pay in comics. Shoot, you can go on X and see all the times writers are asking for people to buy them coffee and pay for their bills.",
            "There is no income restriction on Medicare. You are required to sign up when you turn 65. Medicare is your primary health insurer, unless you have really good insurance you maintain from an employer/former employer and would prefer Medicare be secondary. Pre-existing conditions do not factor when signing up for Medicare.\n\nAt worst, the paperwork/insurance process might cause issues. But Medicare should cover most, if not all, the cost of dialysis.",

            "This was extremely painful to read to say the least for 52.",
            "Not here to shit on the book or dunk on the artists, because there have been bad arcs in comics before and there will certainly be bad arcs again. I can confidently say that the Wells run won't be remembered fondly, but won't go down in history as reviled as the One More Day arc or Clone Saga. But, despite trying to stay open-minded and optimistic about his run, it just doesn't really work for me.\n\nYes, there are the obvious storytelling and character choices that I don't like (MJ getting powers, Ben and Janine becoming weird Halloween-themed antiheroes, the very existence of RekRap), but ideas that often sound silly on paper often actually work really well work in a Spider-Man comic- Spider-Man goes to space to fight a battle to sell toys and somehow winds up coming back to earth with a magic costume made of alien goo, and now the goo is made at him because Peter decided to dump it for spandex again, and we're supposed to believe this is one of his scariest villains? Spider-Man decides to work for Tony Stark and eventually decides to reveal his identity and fights against Captain America? Spidey tells JJJ his identity? All of these ideas sound really dumb, but they ended up working (hell, the very premise of Superior Spider-Man rubbed me the wrong way at first, but it was done so well that it is now one of my favorite Spider-Man arcs ever). So I can forgive a writer for wanting to try something off the wall. But, with all that being said, the Wells run really doesn't work for me, and I think I've figured out why: tone.\n\nYou want to have Peter put his values to the test to see if he can truly learn to forgive his greatest foe and help him on a path to redemption, only to have that good faith be betrayed, forcing Peter to grapple with everything he stands for and come to terms with the darkness within himself? Great, that sounds like a really cool story! You want to do a silly goofy Halloween special where there's a Bizarro Spider-Man who doesn't quite understand the point of being hero, but is completely delusional and oblivious? Okay, that sounds kind of fun, I'm sure the kids will like it. You want to do a reset of the Ben Reilly character to recontextualize him outside of his relationship with Peter? Okay, sure, I guess that makes sense for the character and you could do some interesting things with that. You want to give MJ powers, giving her and Peter a new perspective on their relationship, both past and current? Fine, I don't really like the idea of MJ being a superhero, but why not? But why, why, WHY would you want to do all of these stories at THE SAME TIME?\n\nZeb Wells does not know how to balance the tone of his stories. He wants to tell these big, fantastical, mythological fantasy stories with these characters, but he ALSO wants deep and mature character drama, moral conflict, and shades of grey, while ALSO ALSO wanting to have silly jokes and cartoony moments like the Living Brain and Spider-Goblin's appearance magically changing. But rather than choosing one or two of these elements to focus really hard on and do very well, he tries to do all of them simultaneously and they all come out mediocre at best. It's a bummer, because I think there are some interesting ideas out there, but the way they have been executed, they just don't work. Not every swing has been a miss, but there also haven't really been any home runs. I don't know that it's fair to call his run on ASM \"garbage\" (as some of the comments on here will frequently assert, but I also don't know if anyone will even remember the name Zeb Wells when talking about Spider-Man."

But making asinine decisions that are unpopular, don't work, and that strike almost everybody as being untrue to the characters and actively undo the growth that preceded said asinine decisions? Then doubling down on said bad decisions that prove incredibly unpopular? That is a strange decision.\n\nIt is nice seeing Ultimate Spider-Man telling a great story that seems to get the heart of the characters, specifically Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I really loved the character of Spider-Man growing up (and others, but Peter in particular really spoke to me in a way a lot of other characters didn't). Seeing him in a constant state of arrested development, and then seeing the *One More Day* fiasco and their determination to stick with what was such an obvious mistake that virtually nobody seems to think was actually a good idea, and forcing him to return to an incompetent caricature incapable of growing up, really made me largely stop following the character.

We don't need to see Homer and Marge break up over and over. They're a couple that loves each other, has some frankly honest relationship issues with their marriage, their kids, parents, and in-laws, not to mention their jobs and community. There are even glimpses where the characters experience growth. They stay true to who they are, but there's not some need to reset everything ever so often so they can keep telling the same story. They just...tell the same story. But they seem to do so without ignoring what made the family work in the first place. Even in the movie when (spoiler alert, I guess) Marge left Homer, it wasn't done as a gimmick. The way they have handled Peter and MJ has *totally* felt like a gimmick, and a particularly lazy one at that.\n\nI also think Superman and Lois Lane serve as a good example where they can have people handle conflict appropriately, and when written well they can find fascinating ways to add conflict to the story without relying on repeating de-evolving the characters to have them stay in the same loop.\n\nThe can definitely do better with Spider-Man.",

Seeing Spider-Man like that made me happy, and when watching TAS I was always somewhat drawn to the episodes where Peter and MJ did things together. I never knew why until I grew up and realized I'm a romantic at heart.\n\nOne day, when I was 12, I saw that apparently Peter had died and a new Spider-Man had taken his place (I was just witnessing the beginning of *Superior Spider-Man*) and so I finally got into reading comics in real time as they came out, only for my heart to slowly be devastated.

Because he has a lot of guilt and his understanding about power & responsibility have extreme emotions attached to them.\n\nThis guy's already got all that high school dating stuff in the past, he is doing this Spider-Man thing of helping people without having the impetus of his uncle's death being his fault. At best we could maybe reason \"If I had these powers, maybe I could have saved my aunt\" as a plausible motivation. He should have a more tempered understanding of power & responsibility. \n\nNot just Peter all we have to do is look at Gwen & Harry and how different they are from their 616 versions. \n\nAlso 616, Peter knows how his suit works just fine, for a majority of his life it was just something he sewed up its only when he got jobs in tech fields or became an industrialist that one time that he designed tech-based spider-suits.",

            "\"Look at the other pillars of American entertainment. Soap operas. Professional wrestling. Reality tv. There aren't shows about content people who handle conflict appropriately.\"\n\nTrue. Episodic sitcoms are still one of those pillars of American entertainment though. That's not to say you don't have a point, however The Simpsons is, per the Internet, the longest-running American animated series, American sitcom, and the American scripted primetime television series. I believe my original point stands, even if it wasn't aimed at serialized drama.\n\nFor examples of serialized drama, I think *The Americans,* *Mad Men*, *Breaking Bad*, *The Sopranos*, or shows of that caliber offer great examples that may be more what they could do with relationships in comics. Or Neil Gaiman's *Sandman*. *Especially* Neil Gaiman's *Sandman!* Morpheus and Nada do not have an omni-present romance, but it provides a strong undercurrent and some powerful moments on the page. And the relationships and character trajectory of *Sandman* allows Morpheus to grow while staying true to who he is. His relationship or relating to Nada changes. His relationships with his siblings and his creations change. He is an Endless, and yet undergoes much more fundamentally rich and enduring change that actually sticks than they ever let Peter make. Because they seem to think it's too fun to re-write the nerdy loser who has to find himself and who has to win over the girl, and he has to do so by repeating the same cycle ad infinitum.\n\nThey can have a person have realistic relationships without them being happy and content every second of the day. Those relationships can have problems and they can work out or not. It's o.k. for some relationships to ***NOT*** fail. There can be problems, every relationship has some of those. And it can end, but have it end for reasons other than the devil (literally) made them do it. But Sue Storm and Reed Richards can stay together. Peter and Mary Jane seem to genuinely love each other, so it's fine if they end up together. Or break up but have the kind of relationship divorcees have. Either way, make them realistic and stay true to the characters. Don't keep making choices that we know won't stick and ultimately don't matter, and even if they did they were done in such a ridiculous manner that everybody leaves disappointed.",

            "I occasionally wonder if they keep knocking him down because, by all rights, he's completely equipped to become financially stable/successful and they want to maintain his 'humility' by taking away what he manages to achieve in every area that isn't being a Superhero.\n\nIt's less of a confident opinion and more speculation on the rationale behind their story choices.",
            "I meant to say that what you said before is not what most mean when they speak about competence or lack of in Spider-Man(mainly 616).",
            "Yeah all of the stuff you just mentioned is why I'm completely happy that Miles Morales is in the picture.   \nAbuse him.  Treat him like a teenager who's never allowed to grow up.  Let him be a reciprocal storytelling mechanism of today's youth instead of consistently rebooting Peter Parker.   \nI want Peter Parker..... struggles and all, to be able to become a goddamn functioning adult. Even if he struggles to maintain a job.  Even if he never seems to have enough money in his pocket.  Give him his support network back.   Peter Parker is defined by the impact he has on the people around him.  Just like Spider-Man is.  And currently nobody seems to understand how to write his supporting cast in a way that it makes sense to put them on the pages.",
            "Yes they do they hate the way the writer treats Peter as a person not just as a superhero",
            "Especially considering that the people who **do** support him aren't generally people who have a direct impact on the given situation at hand. They're people who know who he is and care about him.\n\nThey comfort him when he's had a hard day. They give him a hug when he cries. They encourage him when he feels like he's not capable enough.\n\nHe loves the people of New York, but their general appreciation/admiration for him doesn't hold a candle to the people **he** loves being present and in his corner.\n\nEDIT: Just realized after posting my comment that characters like MJ, who love Peter even/especially when he's hurting, is what so many real-life guys are missing in their lives. Real guys have toxic masculinity telling them that they need to be strong and that tears are for weaklings. They're instructed, either by merit of the society we live in, or directly by their parents, that having emotions, of feeling sad or starved for intimacy, isn't 'manly'."
