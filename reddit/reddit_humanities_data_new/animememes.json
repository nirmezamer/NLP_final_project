            "Edit: since we\u2019ve had many new comments about this, here is the official statement about Ferris and characters like her.\n\nWe are not interested in diegetic arguments about these characters. While they are usually confirmed to be women in spin-off content, that\u2019s irrelevant to our real point, which is that these characters are used as transmisogynist caricatures by both authors and fans to spread harmful stereotypes about real trans women. That real-world harm done is our primary concern, over any \u201ccanon\u201d in-universe arguments. An author saying \u201cshe\u2019s just a crossdressing boy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much when that\u2019s how the author views trans women in real life. We\u2019re asking you all to think about this more deeply than just surface textual arguments, thank you.\n\n\nOld comment:\n\nLink to video [here ](https://youtu.be/nxeB2AXIG3E)\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t clear to anyone, the t-word is a slur and will get you a ban on this subreddit, like any other type of hate speech. \n\nSo what does this mean for anime, and what alternatives should you use?\n\nFerris from Re:Zero is explicitly a trans woman and uses she/her pronouns. When talking about Ferris and characters like her, refer to them as women, and use she/her when discussing them. For younger characters like Lily, \u201ctrans girl\u201d is also acceptable.\n\nAstolfo is likewise not a dude and could either be argued to be a trans woman or non-binary. Non-binary might be a new term for some of you, but it just means someone who is a gender other than \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d and it can cover a lot of things. When talking about Astolfo, use they/them. The term \u201cx-gender\u201d is popular in Japan for non-binary characters, and is also acceptable here. Don\u2019t call them \u201che.\u201d\n\nFor characters that are explicitly boys that just present femininely, that\u2019s all they are, feminine boys. For characters that are boys who crossdress, that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing, crossdressing. Calling these characters the t-word is still transphobic even if they themselves are not trans, and saying that characters who are trans are \u201ccrossdressing\u201d is transphobic. \n\nThe word \u201cfemboy\u201d has been used historically and still is used to misgender trans women predominantly in porn and fetish content. Because of this, unless you are a trans woman, you shouldn\u2019t be using the word period, and we don\u2019t allow it\u2019s usage at all in the subreddit. If you want other terms, \u201cTomgirl\u201d and \u201csoftboy\u201d are popular alternatives when talking about feminine or crossdressing men if you need a specific term for it, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s others out there.\n\nAdditionally, the word \u201cfemme\u201d can be used to refer to anyone that presents femininely, whether they be men, women, or non-binary.\n\nWe understand that this is a tumultuous time in the anime community and this may be new information for a lot of you. Nobody knows everything, and as long as you are respectful and open yourself up to being educated, you\u2019ll be fine. Likewise, if you are banned but do not know what you did wrong and are willing to learn, send a respectful message to the moderating team.\n\nEdit: We have been sent in more educational resources by users on the topic, I will link them below and add more that users send in\n\n[Link to thread debunking the response to our posted video by a cis crossdresser that brigaders feel the need to show us constantly, which also includes evidence for Astolfo being non-binary in the comments  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/b4w8k3/cis_crossdresser_dimitri_monroe_dogpiles_and/)\n\n[More evidence for Ferris being trans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/query.php?parent_id=81711&type=att)\n\n[Link to a study on anti-LGBTQ+ slurs conducted on Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/dsntmm/results_perception_of_slurs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nEdit: ThePedanticRomantic\u2019s channel has been taken down due to a hacker fucking with it so their video is currently unavailable.

It\u2019s really shitty that the transphobic people in the anime community have mislabeled characters like Lily as the t-word when her arc was clearly trying to tell the audience that she is a girl. What I\u2019m trying to say is just because characters like Astolfo have become the poster child for the t-word doesn\u2019t mean they should be deemed transphobic, they\u2019ve been mislabeled and we should work to make sure these characters aren\u2019t tossed when plenty of these mislabeled characters are actually wonderful examples of good representation.\n(Edited after looking more into a character\u2019s story so that said character is not mislabeled as something they are not in my post)",

I guess I should also ask if softboy is also acceptable? Though, I would ultimately love to reclaim it if it is bad.\n\nEdit: 2 year update. The egg didn't last long.

            " To be honest you lost me in the middle(i watched the whole video any ways), first of all you take the words using extremely one sided. Word itself mostly used in a positive manner in most of the anime communities. This is an insanely good thing because this means word itself helped acceptance of trans people more than any thing else in anime communities. Second, if some degenerate uses a word to attack a group of people it doesnt mean word itself is a slur. For example, i live in a muslim country, if some american 13 year old boy or a Necbeard comes up to me and says \"you fucking muslim go back to your country\"  or if some one says something like \"you disgusting trans person\", it doesnt mean(or make) word \"trans\" or \"muslim\"  is a slur, it means person in front of me is a discriminating donkey. Also origin of \\[insert banned word\\] is something much light headed than origin of most known slurs. For example if you look at origin of  n-word or f-word, you can see that these words are actually born to oppress, discriminate or humiliate some group of people. But word \\[insert banned word\\] is just born from an internet joke. So i dont believe its a slur and most of the people dont use it as a slur.",

This dichotomy proving that t-word are not trans. He tries to frame as if there were a will for that definition to be prescriptive to stop the argument of \"we just have to force the transphobe not to use this term\" and in a broader sense he is right we can not do that. But the term in anime community is not used prescriptively as excluding trans people (from the definition) it is used descriptively.\n\nI get there are errors in the usage (example in the video) but wrong usage of a term should not define the term : if you went to animeme and show this and say that Felix is trans you could have 2 reactions : \"no this is a t-word\" or \"ah yes you're right, I guess she is not a t-word\". None of them conflating trans and t-word.\n\nThis does not justify using this word because of its usage in a broader context, but I find that willingness, going forward, to merge the trans community with the t-words (or any word that could replace it) to be: \n\n1- alien to the anime community, \n\n2 - hurtful to the trans women community to put them in the same category as feminine men and cross dresser (as if they were not real women) \n\n3 - completely stupid going forward because if we want to change the word we're using why change its meaning to be not ours and more harmful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich get me to the names the video proposed : they're bad because they're including trans people in a word made to be flabbergasted that the cute girl of the show was in fact a boy. As is said in the video \"the t-word is a western construct\"and \"has no ground in Japanese fandom\", it can not be represented as is by a Japanese word. If I were as bold as to give a suggestion to the mod maybe they should make a contest to create a non slurry replacement for the t-word.",

I see that there is a segment within the anime community that like a certain type of characters that are commonly termed by that word. These people may have took to using the word because it was commonly used in the community, without being aware of the negative connotations or uses it could have. In the present controversy, such people will have to deal with new information that challenges what is familiar to them and how they will adapt moving forward. I would think that for the anime community it would be best if they moved to adopt the Japanese terms for the character trope or popularize a new English term that doesn't carry the kind of native baggage that the t word does.

The birth name isn't used very often.\n\nThe English version of the manga sticks to male pronouns, but the original switches back and forth depending on the situation.\n\nShe's been performing a ritual/casting a spell/praying in front of a mirror for six years or so to be a girl. She no longer has to do this as the spell was completed, or \"the words have become a part of the person.\"\n\nShe dreads telling people she was born a boy,afraid of people not wanting to associate with her anymore.\n\nShe's stated she refused to wear men's clothes anymore, and the one time she tried to, she cried.\n\nThe \"I am a man in my body and soul\" line was apparently mistranslated. It originally meant something like \"This outfit is a reflection of my body and spirit.\"\n\nSo if anything, they're a trans girl, and the English version of Re:Zero has made her out to be simply a crossdresser.\n\nA comment on a thread where I sourced these points from says that it should be regarded as a \"God never said that\" trope, or a \"Death of the author\", whose TVTropes page starts with the following...\n\n\"A narrator should not supply interpretations of his work; otherwise he would not have written a novel, which is a machine for generating interpretations.\"\n\nA villain in the fifth arc deduced that she was on some kind of HRT, as the magic she was performing blocked her body's production of testosterone, further going on to say that what Ferris does is \"Very far removed from what would be considered crossdressing.\"\n\nShe keeps her amab status a secret, and uses the women's restrooms.\n\nThe rest of these just strengthen my opinion that the people in charge of the official translation are imposing their own opinions onto the work.\n\n[This is the discussion I'm getting this from:](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/query.php?parent_id=81711&type=att)",

From a young age Crusch has taken a lot of crap for having masculine interests, and they have promised to each take care of what the other lacks: Felis, Crush's femininity and Crush, the knight-like aspects that Felis can't do. That's the reason.\n\nThere isn't a single pronoun in the Japanese. And there's some somewhat messy syntax too - not exactly unclear but I think it mislead that translator a bit.\n\nNagatsuki's comment really does makes it sound like *both* characters are outside the gender binary and lucky to have each other. The translation makes it sounds like Felis has \"hand me down\" femininity that Crusch got rid of because girl stuff bad. \n\n(If we want to get into grammar specifics, the last sentence clarifies the previous sentence fragment.

            "I want to ask a bit more about Astolfo\n\nAccording to the [Apocrypha Material](https://fateapocryphathetranslation.wordpress.com/side-materials/apocrypha-material/) that contains the sketches and comments by Fate/Apocrypha\u2019s author Higashide Yuuichirou and illustrator Konoe Ototsugu:\n\n>**Talk about Astolfo**  \n>  \n>**Higashide:** This is Astolfo-chan, the Servant who stood out and ran around through all the volumes under the excuse, \u201cHe\u2019s prone to running off like a fool, since he\u2019s a fool!\u201d. I\u2019ve seriously ended up no longer knowing what his gender is while I\u2019m writing\u2026 how scary. By the way, in Astolfo\u2019s case, I think that, rather than purposefully dressing as a girl, he simply likes cute things.  \n>  \n>**Konoe:** It\u2019s because his character has expanded and come this far  after starting with the words \u201cflamboyant and androgynous-looking\u201d.

            "This is enlightening. I have only ever seen the t-word used for the original meme purpose and had no idea anyone considered it a slur. The kkk dude saying that was pretty disturbing. I had no idea.\n\n\"Josou\" seems like a perfect replacement that's not offensive. I think most of the animemes community would be receptive to using this if they had some information about how the t-word has been used to hurt people. The mods over there made no attempt to explain anything though. So everyone just feels attacked for no reason. It's a tough situation.\n\nI do have a criticism though. Calling someone transphobic because they say Astolfo and Felix/Ferris are male is a stretch. Most people only know Felix/Ferris from Re:Zero season 1 in which he says \"I'm a boy\". That's the only context most people have.\nSame with Astolfo. It's implied that Astolfo is male. Also the authors comments and the wiki say he's male and that's what people are going to find if they Google it.\n\nI'm not trying to say you are wrong. I'm just saying that calling people transphobic because they think those two are male is wrong because all relevant sources that people have easy access to say they are male.\n\nI'm fine with saying Ferris is trans based on the context of that novel. It doesn't bother me at all. But, most people don't know about that novel. They only know Re: Zero season 1.\n\nPeople aren't being malicious when calling them boys. It's just what the anime depicts, so that's how it's received.",
            "A few things I wanted to mention.\n\n> Astolfo is explicitly non-binary, and uses they/them pronouns. Non-binary might be a new term for some of you, but it just means someone who is a gender other than \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d and it can cover a lot of things. When talking about Astolfo, use they/them. The term \u201cx-gender\u201d is popular in Japan for non-binary characters, and is also acceptable here.\n\nAstolfo is intentionally written as a very ambiguous character, so I think it's okay to interpret him as a non-binary character and it's also okay to interpret him as a femboy character. Astolfo isn't explicitly stated to be non-binary, his gender being left in a very ambiguous state does not necessarily means that he's non-binary, so I think it's better to take advantage of that ambiguity and let different communities feel represented by the character. (I'm referring to Astolfo as \"him\" because I view him as a femboy.)\n\n>The word \u201cfemboy\u201d has been used historically and still is used to misgender trans women predominantly in porn but also in other settings, but is messier because some trans people have tried to reclaim it (usually non-binary people).\n\nThis part is what I particularly take an issue with because it feel like you're erasing the community that identifies with that term, or at the very least ignoring it. There are people who choose to call themselves \"femboys\", they are feminine men (of course this includes trans men). No idea what to say about non-binary people calling themselves femboys, to be honest I never heard of a femboy identifying as non-binary, the term literally has the word \"boy\" on it so it kinda excludes everyone who doesn't identify as male, though I don't mind if a non-binary person calls themselves a femboy.\n\nI have heard before that femboys can't reclaim the T-word because the slur wasn't directed to them (some femboys want to reclaim it), but \"femboy\" doesn't belong to trans people either even if it has been directed at them by transphobic people misusing the term, I mean, the trans community can't reclaim a word that already belongs to another community. Gender non conforming men exist and we usually call ourselves femboys, I understand that you don't know much about us, I also don't know that much about the trans community, for example I wasn't aware that the T-word was a slur until fairly recently, but I still take issue with you pretty much denying our identity and saying that the word we use to define ourselves is a transphobic slur.\n\n>Because of this, unless you are trans, do not use the word, unless a trans person explicitly tells you that they want to be referred to as it.\n\nI can agree with this as long as we're talking about trans people, feminine trans men often call themselves femboys but I wouldn't call any feminine-looking trans men a femboy because they may be feminine for reasons they didn't chose, it's only okay to use that term if you know they want to be called that way. In the other hand, if you're a femboy you can use the term freely to refer to yourself or to other femboys, though again, when it comes to other people, it would be better to know beforehand if they want to be called femboys or not.\n\nFemboy is not a bad term per se, it could be bad if it's used to misgender a trans women in the same way something like \"feminine man\" or just \"man\" would also be bad in that context, even though there is nothing wrong with none of those terms. In the same way, misgendering a femboy by calling them a trans girl or non-binary when they are men would also be bad, but of course neither of those terms are slurs.\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as disrespectful or as me trying to troll or to pick a fight, I just wanted to get that off my chest, and I wouldn't like to see our word be re-appropriated by transphobic people and turned into a transphobic slur.",
            "That was a great video thank you for sharing it. I personally think tomgirl would be a good term to use for people who identify as men that dress feminine instead of femme or femboy. We already use tomboy to describe the inverse so why not start using tomgirl.",

Ferris at no point in novel is referred to with female pronouns (Kanojo), and with personal pronouns it's an even more odd statement considering any gender can use any pronoun they wish in Japanese. Being referred to as chan hardly means anything considering you can use it on either gender, and for Ferris' character, it makes more sense to use chan anyways.

To me it seems that it has possibly prevented hate crime charges in two of the three cases. For example one ended in murder of the first degree with a hate crime included. Another got reduced from first degree murder to voluntary manslaughter, and the third had two convicted of second degree murder with the third convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Without reading all the details of these cases it surprises me that one ended in first degree murder and another attempted to. My opinion, and I'm not a lawyer so take this with a massive grain of salt, is these cases seem to fall into second degree murder or voluntary manslaughter. This defense doesn't seem effective at preventing a murder conviction, but might prevent a hate crime conviction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give my opinion of the ban I have no qualms on the word being banned.

I am not too well read on the topic of Ferris' history and I would like some clarification.\n\nEver since getting into the re:zero series I haven't heard of Ferris as being really explicitly referred to as a trans woman in the anime or by the author (i.e. simply \"ferris is trans\").\n\nSimilar to the Q&A you've linked, I found a twitter Q&A thread in which the author  answered some fans' questions.\n\nLooking at some of those tweets:\n\n[https://twitter.com/petitmisa\\_417/status/952937991105798144](https://twitter.com/petitmisa_417/status/952937991105798144)\n\nQ: Why is Ferris a man?\n\nA: Ferris is a man, but there are some stories that I can only write if someone was a boy, but had a reason to dress \\[\u683c\u597d refers to outwards appearance\\] like a girl \\[I am assuming reasoning as in the promise with Crusch\\], that's why.\n\nI'd consider this question very similar to the one you referred to. In both replies, the author says \"\u5973\u6027\u306e\u683c\u597d\" and \"\u5973\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u683c\u597d\" (TL: the appearance of a woman/dressing like a woman) and not \"\u5973\u6027\u3068\u3057\u3066\" (TL: as a woman)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Daichi20021124/status/952937985917386752](https://twitter.com/Daichi20021124/status/952937985917386752)\n\nQ: Does Ferris like men lol?  (\u7537\u597d\u304d is used to refer to women who likes to have relationships with men)\n\nA: No, Ferris plainly likes women, and he has his set his eyes on Crusch-sama.\n\n[https://twitter.com/quick\\_grimoire\\_/status/952937918770769922](https://twitter.com/quick_grimoire_/status/952937918770769922)\n\nQ: When did Ferris start behaving like a woman?\n\nA: Age-wise \\~10, soon after Ferris became Crusch's attendant. The reason why Crusch started behaving like a man and Ferris like a woman is because of a promise they exchanged.\n\nSo going off of these tweets, can Ferris be definitely identified as transgender? If I'm missing something and it says Ferris is trans I'll respect the classification, but if its more into the gray zone I think it's not really reflecting the character to categorize Ferris into a specific gender and call on others to do the same.\n\nThanks.",

Usually, companies have a bunch of guidelines that you have to follow in order to work for them. In addition to this, many people who are not translators believe themselves to be experts in grammar and push their old-fashioned and non-scientific ideas onto you (or even worse, your boss is a non-native, non-proficient speaker who thinks they know better than you). \n\nThere's also the fact that, especially with audiovisual translation, deadlines are sometimes very tight and we are given very little context to work with (we are sometimes given just a script, not even the actual full episode). This is actually responsible for probably 50%+ of bad translations everywhere.\n\nOf course, some translators also don't care/don't think about this. But I don't think it's right to call out all translators in all cases of misgendering/bad translation when many times our higher ups are responsible.\n\nEdit: all of this applies only to professional translation.

To claim that they are definitively 1 thing is....short sighted at best, or outright trying to push something onto a character.\n\nSadly the majority of people here can't even read Japanese, so  they will just continue to parrot whatever suits their narrative.\n\n\nFor reference, just like in English, the personal pronouns in Japanese are used interchangeably (as in, a female could use Boku if she wishes, even though it's traditionally used by males), but regardless, most seem to use Watashi in public settings/work, among others.

Yours is a superficial evaluation which falls in the same problem of the mods, that is \"We won't really talk with you, just let you know that we deemed it to be the right choice\".

The argument makes no distinction between its weeb and non weeb usage.

Crusch coming to act male (masculine) and Felis female (feminine) was at the same time and was based on their promise to each other. \n\nThis one's probably the most grammatically interesting, because of this \u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306e \"you ni natta no\" thing that appears twice. In English we usually don't express this meaning the same way, and it's really wrapped up with Japanese concepts of volition and group membership. This can really confuse machine translation, and it can make short quotes or sentence fragments *hilariously* difficult to capture. \n\nVerb + \"you ni\" means \"so that,\" but it's non-volitional. In English we say \"in order to do something,\" \"so that something will happen,\" and \"so that something will be.\" This Japanese expression is more focused: \"so that something might be.\" Or something that happens without active, personal, wanting to do something.\n\nThis expression is used to express wishes/prayers. Habits. Also, going along with a group decision, that's also treated like it's non-volitional - and that's what's happening here. (That's obvious from the last part of the tweet, talking about a mutual promise.) So this translation, \n\n> The reason why Crusch started behaving like a man and Ferris like a woman is because of a promise they exchanged.\n\nit's what translators call \"flattened.\" There was some information in the Japanese that was lost because it is awkward or unusual to express it in English. (We don't care as much about group membership and whether something is done on individual initiative or in cooperation with other people. Japanese grammar cares a lot less about singular-vs-plural or present-vs-future.)\n\nUnfortunately I haven't yet been able to get my hands on [this story](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Stories_of_the_Great_Crusch-sama_Prologue:_Ferris%27_Sudden_Emergence), which I think would clear up a lot about the contents and conditions of this promise. But Crusch beating Fourier to within an inch of his life gives us some idea of how high the stakes are.",
            "I am now decently well-read on the topic. I've been looking at the Japanese text, the original tweets, and how fan-translators have treated her.\n\nThere is *no* evidence that she has a cis gender identity. *None.*\n\nWhen English speaking fans get that impression, it's about 80% because of mistaken or possibly slanted fan-translations, and 20% because of cultural differences in how trans women are conceptualized in Japan.\n\nFor example there's one scene when she's described as really happy to see Crusch. Bubbly. Very girly. Nagatsuki's narrator calls her something like a \"young woman, or at least a person who couldn't be seen as anything else\" (my paraphrase from memory). But a fan translator renders this as \"an effeminate young man\" and adds to the description that her attitude is \"sly\" even though Nagatsuki wrote *nothing* of the sort.\n\nThat's the moment that *most* offends me, as trans person, as a translator, and now as a fan. (The story *is* pretty good. I'm now working on a translation of WN Arc 2, a part in which Felis barely appears, because I like the story *that* much...)\n\nHere's the situation around Felis's gender as it's handled in Japanese text of the web-novel:\n\n - She talks about herself in heavly feminine ways, but *not* o-nee (feminine gay man). She's more girly than Ram, for crying out loud.\n\n - The narrator's physical descriptions of her body also emphasize her femaleness.\n\n  - But she's not called things like \"effeminate\" - no, more like \"hot.\"\n\n - She tolerates people calling her \"he\" but clearly dislikes being called a man. \n\n - The narrator uses \"he.\"\n\n - She prefers to let her body speak for itself.\n\n - The descriptions in the web-novel suggest that she has some degree of curviness, female fat distribution. \n\n - she's literally the best healer in the world\n\n - and Japanese culture has a (kinda obnoxious) idea that surgery is necessary before pronouns should be changed. So *that's* what's going on: non-op trans woman who *has* been able to physically transition in a fantasy setting because magic\n\n---\n\nShe does have a \"mutual promise\" with Crusch. And the word used to describe what they've done is \"makaseru\" - to leave something to someone else. \n\n\"Entrust\" isn't wrong, but it's a rough translation that doesn't really capture the connotation. It's not really \"ill trade genders with you\" and more like \"we'll deal with gender-role expectations by each playing to our strengths.\" All that girly stuff that Crusch is ambivalent about? She'll leave it to Felis.\n\nMy favorite line from all of this is how Felis paraphrases Crusch: \"No body suits a soul as well as its own, the one that lets it shine most bright.\" That line comes after the more commonly quoted \"sure, Feli-chan's a guy.\"\n\nBut the quoted line? Context. Subaru says some nasty stuff, she offers that line as an \"agree to disagree\" gesture. He doesn't take it, so she instead goes with \"well, screw you, Crusch supports me, so there.\"",
            "Felis's reason exists before the promise, not after. Her presentation starts at that point, but it's because she can trust that Crusch will take care of things.\n\nThe way I read that is that Felis *knows* something has to change about racism and misogyny. She has already experienced the horrible depths of both, even at 10 years old. And she's noticed that the only way women can have enough of a voice too hope to change things is if they're masculine enough.\n\nSo, she can't present as feminine. Not if she needs to change the world.\n\nAnd then Crusch, who was at least ambivalent about feminine presentation, promised to take care of that. Being the masculine, politically active force. \n\nThat's the promise. Felis doesn't have to man-up, Crusch doesn't have to be girl enough, they can each count on the other. And if the royal family falls (which it does) they'll take their ideals into the Selection.\n\n---\n\nThat interpretation also explains why Felis's gender is necessary to the story, it's not just tacked on. Crusch rejects traditional privilege because of what it did to her (them?) and especially to Felis. There's something rotten in Lugnicia and they *hate* it.",
            "Unfortunately, it's only sad if it had been accidentally mid-translated. So many translators have been so reliably bending-over-backwards-to-be 'mis-translating' to write out trans characters that it's obviously intentional, and is the extremely bigoted act of trans erasure.\n\n\n It's infuriating for those of us who are trans, and just want enjoy our fav characters finally getting brought over, only to have their stories consistantly mangaled.

If you check the tag \u201cfemboy\u201d on twitter, over half of the posts are also tagged with the t-slur.\n\nSecondly, the word has its origin in misgendering trans women, and was first popularized by calling trans women \u201cfemboys\u201d in porn, alongside other slurs.\n\nLastly, a lot of \u201cfemboy\u201d art itself is transphobic, and much of it labels characters that are explicitly trans as \u201cfemboys\u201d or takes an anime girl, puts a dick bulge on it, and says it\u2019s a \u201cfemboy\u201d now, which normalizes the idea that penis = boy, which is transphobic.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that people who identify as feminine boys are bad people, and there are people who use the term without intending harm, but I would still ask that people not use the term because of the negative connotations, and instead use alternatives like \u201cfeminine boy,\u201d or \u201cfemme.\u201d",

Instead of he or she, you call them \u201cthey.\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re talking about someone that presents femininely, you can call them a \u201cfemme,\u201d and this is ok for any gender.\n\nI understand that it can be hard to memorize, so just do your best and we\u2019ll be understanding",

If that's the case, what you are saying makes even less sense. \n\n\n\nThe full context of why Ferris is the way they are is as thus. They were abused for 9 years, locked away in a basement by their parents, and Crusch saved them. Crusche, being the leader of her family, felt the need to play a more masculine role (mind you, she was always more interested in \"male things\" like sword fighting and male clothing), and Ferris was never good at being a Knight, literally. Ferris says in series that they aren't good at fighting. \n\nSo, they formed a promise. Crusch left the girly role (idk what to describe this ass) to Ferris, and Ferris left the knightly role to Crusch.  \n\n\n\n\"the words have become a part of the person\u201d is about the mirror scene right?  Pretty sure that entire scene is self hypnosis to produce the effect you are describing, basically trying to stop the aging process so as to continue their pact with Crusch.

Weebs are well-known to be stubborn, and I won't expect a community of almost one million of members to bend their head in a day. I think the rule should've been enforced in a soft-way \u2013 for the first week, after properly explaining and researching why is it a slur (and not the Blizzard statement).

Emilia looks exactly like the Witch of Envy (a Name to Run From) and is shunned for that reason. The Twins are from a minority group *and* are shunned by that group over a birth defect. Beatrice is spoilers. \n\nMy feeling is that Nagatsuki isn't going to use the explicit word \"transgender\" because the story isn't about labels. It's about characters and struggle and a lot of suffering.\n\nFor the same reason I'd rather not be quoted to support labeling. I personally read her as trans, I call her \"her\" when I write. But when I translate, the narrator says \"kare\" and I write \"he\" because that respects the author's intent. I think it's more important to empathize with the character than to rush to claim a label.\n\nIf I write a translation, people read it, and they think \"she's not trans\" I don't count that as a failure. There's some wiggle room and different people naturally have different experiences that will lead to different readings. *This is okay.*\n\nBut if they come away from this thinking that Felis's femininity is a prank being pulled on male characters or on the audience, or that Crusch put a perfectly normal boy in a dress as part of a kinky power play - *that* would be a failure of translation. Because those tropes are not at all present in the Japanese text. \n\nIf you search my comment history for \"Felis,\" you'll see why I've gone deep into explaining the Japanese text at several points. Feel free to quote those and to point out that while the author doesn't seem to be \"saying trans rights\" in an explicit way, he does write a character who is very comfortably and naturally femme.\n\nI'm working on a translation of Arc 2 of the web novel right now. That part isn't about Felis. (She makes her first appearance towards the end, but it's brief.) I figure that haters will hate anyway, but I don't need to give them ammunition by taking a trans advocacy position that's more confrontational than I actually hold.\n\nYes, I do think she's as trans as is possible in her situation. And yes, the controversy is why I started reading in the first place But I'd rather translate the text with as much respect for the author as I can manage. \n\nWhich is a lot of respect. I like how he's going about things in general. I really like Subaru as a painfully nerdy character, creepy Roswaal, socially isolated Emilia, etc. And that's why I've decided to start in Arc 2, before Felis is even present. \n\ntl;dr please don't reduce my position to \"Felis is trans\" especially in a direct attack on transphobia.

It's possible that the expression \u6b74\u3068\u3057\u305f is etymologically related to \u5217\u8a18 because look at the definition for the latter:\n\n - \u95a2\u4fc2\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u67c4\u3092\u7701\u7565\u305b\u305a\u3001\u5168\u90e8\u3057\u308b\u3059\u3053\u3068\n  - to indicate/define the entirety of the related thing without abridgement\n\n\n---\n\nOh, and if you're wondering how I get \"dispatch\" out of \u4f7f\u3046\u3001here's the full Shinmeikai definition \n\n(\u4e00)\u3008\uff08\u306a\u306b\u30cb\uff09\u306a\u306b\u30fb\u3060\u308c\u30f2\u2015\u3009 \u3042\u308b\u4e8b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u50cd\u304b\u305b\u308b\u3002   \n\u300c\u25b3\u982d\uff08\u6c17\u30fb\u795e\u7d4c\u30fb\u304b\u3089\u3060\uff09\u3092\u2015\uff0f\u91d1\u3092\u2015\uff0f\u4eba\u3092\u2015\u3014\uff1d(\uff41)\u8a00\u3044\u3064\u3051\u3066\uff08\u81ea\u5206\u306e\uff09\u7528\u3092\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002 (\uff42)\u96c7\u3046\u3015\u300d   \n(\u4e8c)\u3008\uff08\u306a\u306b\u30cb\uff09\u306a\u306b\u30f2\u2015\u3009 \u3042\u308b\u4e8b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u25b3\u6750\u6599\uff08\u9053\u5177\u30fb\u624b\u6bb5\uff09\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u3002   \n\u300c\u3060\u3057\u306b\u2015\uff0f\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u2015\u3014\uff1d\u8a71\u3059\u3015\uff0f\u5c45\u7559\u5b88\u3092\u2015\uff0f\u308f\u3044\u308d\u3092\u2015\u3014\uff1d\u8cb7\u53ce\u3059\u308b\u3015\u300d   \n(\u4e09)\u3008\u306a\u306b\u30f2\u2015\u3009 \u305d\u308c\u3067\u4f55\u304b\u3092\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u91cf\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u3002   \n\u300c\u7d19\u3092\u3080\u3084\u307f\u306b\u2015\u300d   \n(\u56db)\u3008\u306a\u306b\u30f2\u2015\u3009 \u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u3063\u3066\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3002   \n\u300c\u5f01\u5f53\u3092\u2015\u3014\uff1d\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3015\uff0f\u6e6f\u3092\u2015\u3014\uff1d\u5165\u6d74\u3059\u308b\u3015\u300d   \n(\u4e94)\u3008\u306a\u306b\u30f2\u2015\u3009 \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u601d\u3046\u901a\u308a\u306b\u64cd\u308b\u3002   \n\u300c\u4eba\u5f62\u3092\u2015\u300d   \n[\u8868\u8a18]\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u7528\u6cd5\u306f\u300c\u9063\u3046\u300d\u3068\u3082\u66f8\u304f\u3002   \n\n---\n\nSo let me tie this together in a dynamic translation.

A person who identifies as a member of these groups would likely be offended by such stereotypes, but that does not make the terms \"women\", \"men\", and \"anime fans\" slurs. \n\nSimilarly, the negative stereotype \"cis people are inconsiderate towards trans people\", does not by itself make the term \"cis\" a slur. Is it possible for \"cis\" to be used as a slur, absolutely, if the word \"cis\" is being used by itself to be an insult (e.g. \"you're a disgusting cis person\").\n\nIf you're point is only that stereotyping is bad, then I 100% agree with you, it's harmful and wrong to judge every member of a group in exactly the same way.

            "It\u2019s very clear what you\u2019re trying to pull and it\u2019s not going to fly here. The t-slur is a slur, saying \u201cwell acktually I don\u2019t mean it as one\u2014\u201c doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s still a slur.",
            "It pretty much means that tho. If Astolfo was anything else, it would propably be mentioned in that same scene, otherwise it would just get confusing. Male pronouns are also used. To remove any doubts author further confirms that he's a boy in official F/A material. That's one hell of an evidence.",
            "You don\u2019t need to use female pronouns to be non-binary? Astolfo not wanting to be known as male seems like a pretty clear indicator that they aren\u2019t male",

            "Ruka, before transitioning, outright says she wants to be a girl. I'd be shocked of the author who wrote that turned around and said she wasn't trans. I'd have to fact check a claim like that.",
            "Yes, the demands of the \"Revolutionaries\" were not met. They were engaged in a full on brigading scheme and it got bad enough that outside groups started to get involved.\n\nThe mods were sent constant death threats and seriously mentally damaging material constantly throughout the \\~21 days before the sub-reddit was shut down.\n\nOne of the mods threatened suicide from all the stress. Another mod was SWATed and almost killed by the police because of a prank call made with the express purpose of hurting them. The mod team decided to shut the sub-reddit down because it was becoming dangerous for them. Many of the mods wiped their accounts, deleted all of their posts, and left for their own physical safety.\n\nSomeone posted the personal information of the mod team. Doxxed.\n\nThe admins had to step in and shut shit down.\n\nYou can get the full story [here at SRD](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/idpn47/ranimemes_goes_nuclear_as_the_mods_set_it_to/).\n\nThe people who did this are fucked up and evil.

            "You\u2019re doing good work here. I\u2019m disappointed but not surprised that so many people want to pretend tr*p isn\u2019t a slur. I\u2019ve never seen it used in anything but a derogatory way; I mean the word itself is grossly problematic in this context. If someone feels like they were  \u201ctrapped\u201d because they were attracted to someone and found out that person was trans then that is not something they put on that person, that\u2019s on THEM. It assumes that trans people or characters who pass very well are only doing it to spite cis straight people. I wish people would think about that rather than just blindly defend it. Anyway, thank you for doing what you do OP.",

            "Astolfo (and the real life person he is based on) is very clearly male according to fate lore, as mentioned both by the creators and Astolfo himself. There are characters that better fit the category in the fate universe though. For example, if I remember my lore correctly, Chevalier D\u2019eon is canonically genderfluid, in that they don\u2019t*identify* with one single gender.",

            "It's just sad that this stuff no longer surprises me. It's practically Gamer Gate 2.0 in the making. Basically, alt-right groups look for wedge issues like this and use it as recruitment schemes by trying to stoke a culture war.\n\nThe person who founded the \"Good\" Animemes subreddit is a confirmed nazi and incredible bigot. Since that person hand-picked all of the current moderators over at that sub-reddit, one doesn't have to connect a lot of dots to understand why they are so hateful toward the trans community.\n\nThey use \"Free speech\" and \"good moderation\" and other community dog whistles as ways of covering up their tactics to the uninformed layperson. And then they use those uninformed community members as pawns to burn places down.\n\nBecause of the mass amount of spamming that went on it provided cover for the really sinister people who used the \"Revolution\" to carry out their own personal hate campaigns.\n\nIt's something we have to be aware of and inform each other about and not let them rewrite history. And especially we have to crack down on it the moment we see it in other sub-reddits. That's why this sub is so clean right now. The mods have a zero-tolerance policy for hate. We need more mods like them.",

            "Well I agree that this is far beyond what was in anyway resonable, but the swats and so on where not done by people who where upset because of the word ban, but by people who have some serious issues and just used that as a fucking excuse.",
            "How tf is this downvoted?",
            "Yeah, they added that into his character sheet part of the running gag with his character, transphobic as it may be depending on your interpretation. But he clearly states that he is male within the dialogue, and goes as far as to make fun of other characters when they mistake him for any gender other than male, which is why the slur became so prevalent."
