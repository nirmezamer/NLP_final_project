            "the same can be said of many countries. I'm not excusing Russia or their action but to think they are \"simple\" and blindly follow, whereas we in the west (for example) are \"better\" ingores many of our faults. Eg look at tge rise of the right/religion/conspiracy and char8smatic yet damaging leaders gaining popularity.\n\nregardless, fuck Rusdia and Slava Ukrain",
            "sounds reasonable, would be very low-range anti-drone tech then... interesting!",
            "I got that. But with the tank having anti-drone tech, how did the drone come close enough? That's my question.\n\nCan drones easily approach from above? Like being high-enough over the tank to not be affected, with reasonably low to aim properly? Is the anti-drone only effective against suicide-drones?",
            "But If you ran out of APCs, have only useless tanks left and Major General Ivan wants the next assault to start at dawn?",
            "I mean it does work very well when executed correctly, in terms of achieving military objectives.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as scary as it used to be before the advent of cheap drones though.",
            "> anti-drone tech\n\n> tech\n\nIt doesn't actually have either of those things.",
            "Afaik, drone dropped munitions disabled it track, not Fpv drones we normally see. Which mean, the drone flying high enough to avoid Ecw interference & and being able to dropped let say, shrapnel warhead right to tank tracks side.",
            "> But with the tank having anti-drone tech, how did the drone come close enough?\n\nIn order to disrupt a signal, you need to be louder then the signal around it.\n\nSo if a drone gets close to a ECM, your overwhelming the frequency that it MAY be operating on, so any incoming or outgoing signals get disrupted.\n\nBut disrupting a signal is a game of power. And power is linked to how many watts you can put out. So lets say a signal can be 95% disrupted at 5m, with 400W (made up numbers). But at 10m, your efficiency drop link a brick to maybe 20%. So how can you disrupt something at 10m, well, maybe you need to output 4000W of signal strength to overwhelm. But at 15m ...\n\nThe more distance, the more power you tend to need to disrupt signals. So if a drone flies 25m over your head:\n\n* You need a insane amount of power to get 360 degree, coverage\n* That drone is also flying high, so less thing that will be blocking its return signal to home base (like trees etc). So any jamming will be even less efficient, vs a already compromised signal that has issue with geography and obstacles. \n\nSo again, jamming helps against FPV drones and even that can be overcome by drones if for instance they have a \"dead man switch\". Aka, where you tell a drone to fly by a set of predefined instructions. You move in for a kill, set the drone into \"dead man mode\", and if you lose signal, the drone will keep flying into the previous direction. And there goes your ECM! \n\nWe know Ukraine is already doing this with bigger drones, with simple \"AI\" to recognize targets (if it loses signal).\n\nReality is, ECM has a use but there are counters against it. You may lose accuracy but still get relative good hit rates using inertia or other old fashion \"speed * distance * travel time * ...\" calculations.\n\nNow there are other forms of ECM but they are not relevant to this tank ECM stuff (GPS spoofing etc).\n\n>  Like being high-enough over the tank to not be affected, with reasonably low to aim properly?\n\nPeople have gotten very good at dropping from high altitude. Lots of experience means a operator can \"guess\" very well where something will fall. The closer you are, the more accurate but you will be amazed at how high drones drop.\n\nSure, ECM will mean that you need more attempts to take out a target, less of a issue with reusable drop drones. So the main benefit is disrupting those RPG7 FPV drones. But we have seen footage of drone operators literally guessing, slamming the drone forward, it getting disrupted (video feed becoming a massive mess) and still hitting. More difficult yes, more drones needed to take out a target, yes. Ultimate protection: Hell no! Far from it.\n\nAnd the issue is, that a RPG7 drone is literally a warhead where they have huge amounts off, and a cheap 200$ (if even that these days) drone (even less because a lot are 3d printed these days, with simple electronics and a strapped on battery pack). That ECM is going to be WAY more expensive... In the cost war, its a loss.\n\nIts those big ECM platforms, that can disrupt entire areas that are a issue, but those can also be geolocated back and Mr Himars tend to say hello. Or they figure out what frequencies it jams, and modify a few drones to operate on other frequencies and go say \"hi\". Again, power = range, but the more frequencies you try to jam = more equipment + power needed. So its a cat and mouse game of switching frequencies between both sides to get the best value out of ECM or Drones.",

That is what we witness now happening. I wish I could see a Nurenberg-style trial with old Vlad sitting on the bench in handcuffs, but this, unfortunately, is extremely unlikely to happen.

            "Yeah, but if I come to think of the funny German painter, these sort of people do really believe that they can take on the whole world alone. There's a saying that history repeats itself, and boy what a big truth that is. Only thing is that some people fail to learn the lessons of history. Putin, despite of otherwise being a well educated man actually, is just committing that mistake. Prime example why nobody should be allowed to spend more than two terms as head of a state, just like in the US. Power distorts personality, mentality, the way of thinking and creates a false sense of invincibility. Especially uncontrolled power, where thee are no brakes, no nothing to hold one back from doing whatever he/she wishes with an entire country and it's people..",

Which is a shame of modern history. But grabbing the entire country is a whole different thing, especially a country that has fought so hard to get rid of Russian dominance and average people literally shed their blood on the streets for that. The shitfuckery the West does about helping Ukraine is still a shame, but at least the wheels are already turning and as I said before, the shit is already flowing backwards into Vlad's face, though that's little consolation to the millions displaced, killed, wounded, disabled by this war.",

If he is alive there will always be that fear of him having influence or god forbid power again one day.",
            "I think Crimea was a wakeup call for the west. After the invasion the US started under Obama to support Ukraine with non lethal support. Eventually training the troops on western war doctrine. This resulted in a better trained troops that went into the 2022 conflicted compared to 2014. This was already a smart move from the west. Hopefully they will fully support Ukraine for the rest of the war in order to finally stop Putin colonial ambitions."
