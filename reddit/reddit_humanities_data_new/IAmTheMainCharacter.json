I'm all for defending yourself if your life is at risk but porch pirates aren't threatening your life over this.

Plan your orders for times you know you will be home to receive the delivery.\n\n3). Request accomodations through the courier to deliver to a different, less visible location. Obviously this won't stop people like the two idiots in the post but it will reduce that. \n\n4). Order for in store pickup whether that's through your courier or the place you're ordering from.\n\n5). Don't order stuff at all and find what you need locally. \n\n\nAll of those options don't involve shooting porch pirates and risking time in prison because you're annoyed someone else is inconveniencing you.",

I'm saying that package theft isn't a justified reason to shoot and possibly kill someone over. \n\nI'm a gun owner. I carry. I'm all for defending yourself. I'm never gonna pull my gun on and shoot someone stealing packages off my porch because they do not pose imminent risk of death or great bodily harm.\n\nThe worst thing I'm gonna have to do is get a police report for theft and ask the company for either a refund or product replacement. All of which is easier than having to go to court and face a possible prison sentence because I shot and killed someone that posed no violent threat to me. \n\nUnless you can explain to me why someone stealing your package proves significant enough of a threat to be shot and possibly killed then there isnt a reason for violence when less extreme options are exponentially better than someone potentially dying.",
