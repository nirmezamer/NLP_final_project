        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nThe mod team has noticed a marked increase in racism and intolerance, in particular towards immigrants from India. Reddit has noticed as well and has begun removing such posts and/or comments.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that one side of the political spectrum has found their wedge issue and they are pushing it as hard as they can, stirring up hatred however they can and blaming immigrants for everything from jaywalking to the housing crisis despite the fact that many of the issues are worldwide. Facts and reality don\u2019t matter, only blaming \"brown people\" and those they perceive as being responsible for those \"terrible\" people being here.\n\nTherefore, we would like to remind all of our users that the [Reddit sitewide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) apply here and will be enforced.\n\n**You ALL AGREED to these rules when you created your account.**\n\nYour \u201copinion\u201d is irrelevant, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if you really, really believe it, you cannot push your unfounded racist positions here.\n\n**Again, for the people in the back, being able to use Reddit is conditional to respecting these rules.**\n\nIn particular:\n\n>**Rule 1**  \n>  \n>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n\nThe important parts are:\n\n**users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned**\n\n[Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on:](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951)\n\n* their actual and perceived race\n* colour\n* religion\n* national origin\n* ethnicity\n* **IMMIGRATION STATUS**\n* etc\n\nWhile the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination (E.G. \u201cI\u2019m just stating my opinion\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just stating fact\u201d).\n\nAnother important portion is:\n\n**free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence**\n\nThat includes all of our users and the moderator team. Insults, derogatory comments and attacks will not be tolerated. If you post comments or message the moderators with insults and/or attacks, you WILL be banned on the spot.\n\nTherefore, going forward, we are going to clamp down hard on posts or comments attributing, without damn good evidence, the cause of any issue to immigrants or a subset thereof. That includes any reference to area with high immigration (e.g. Brampton) or any other form of dog whistles. It also includes attributing to an ethnic group of people the crimes or faults of an individual (e.g. the guy who proposed using food banks to save money). Message to the bigots: you\u2019re nowhere as subtle as you think you are.\n\nAnd before any complaints bring it up: [No, your right to free speech nor freedom of expression has not been violated](https://xkcd.com/1357/).  \n\n---  \n\nBonjour \u00e0 tous, L'\u00e9quipe des mod\u00e9rateurs a remarqu\u00e9 une augmentation marqu\u00e9e du racisme et de l\u2019intol\u00e9rance, en particulier envers les immigrants venant de l\u2019Inde. Les administrateurs de Reddit ont aussi remarqu\u00e9 et ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 supprimer les publications et les commentaires de ce genre.\n\nC\u2019est assez clair qu\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 du spectre politique a trouv\u00e9 son sujet pour diviser les gens et ils le poussent autant qu\u2019ils le peuvent en cr\u00e9ant de la division et la haine autant que possible en bl\u00e2mant les immigrants pour tout et rien m\u00eame quand le probl\u00e8me attribu\u00e9 est mondial. Les faits et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sont sans importance, la seule chose qui compte c\u2019est de bl\u00e2mer les \u201cbruns\u201d et les personnes per\u00e7ues comment \u00e9tant responsable de la pr\u00e9sence de cer derniers\n\nDonc, nous voulons rappeler \u00e0 tous nos utilisateurs que les [r\u00e8gles \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du site Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) s'appliquent ici aussi et seront appliqu\u00e9es.\n\n**Vous avez TOUS ACCEPT\u00c9 ces r\u00e8gles lors de la cr\u00e9ation de votre compte.**\n\nVotre \u00ab opinion \u00bb est sans cons\u00e9quence et \u00e7a ne fait rien si vous y croyez tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s fort, vous ne pouvez pas pousser votre merde raciste ici.\n\n**Encore une fois, pour les personnes qui tardent \u00e0 comprendre, l\u2019utilisation de Reddit est conditionnelle aux respect de ces r\u00e8gles.**\n\nEn particulier:\n\n>**R\u00e8gle 1**  \n>  \n>Souvenez-vous de l'humain. Reddit est un lieu destin\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une communaut\u00e9 et un sentiment d'appartenance, et non \u00e0 attaquer des groupes de personnes marginalis\u00e9s ou vuln\u00e9rables. Tout le monde a le droit d\u2019utiliser Reddit sans harc\u00e8lement, intimidation et menaces de violence. Les communaut\u00e9s et les utilisateurs qui incitent \u00e0 la violence ou qui promeuvent la haine bas\u00e9e sur l'identit\u00e9 ou la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 seront interdits.\n\nLes parties importantes sont :\n\n**les utilisateurs qui incitent \u00e0 la violence ou qui promeuvent la haine bas\u00e9e sur leur identit\u00e9 ou leur vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 seront bannis**\n\n[Les groupes marginalis\u00e9s ou vuln\u00e9rables incluent, sans s'y limiter, les groupes bas\u00e9s sur :](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951)\n\n* leur race r\u00e9elle et per\u00e7ue\n* la couleur\n* la religion\n* l'origine nationale\n* l'appartenance ethnique\n* **STATUT D'IMMIGRATION**\n* etc\n\nM\u00eame si la r\u00e8gle sur la haine prot\u00e8ge ces groupes, elle ne prot\u00e8ge pas ceux qui promeuvent des attaques haineuses ou qui tentent de cacher leur haine en faisant \u00e9tat de discrimination de mauvaise foi.\n\n# Exemple : article d\u00e9crivant une minorit\u00e9 raciale comme \u00e9tant sous-humaine et inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 raciale. Indice : cela inclut la capacit\u00e9 de conduire.\n\nL\u2019autre partie importante est : **sans harc\u00e8lement, intimidation et menaces de violence**\n\nCela inclut tous nos utilisateurs et l\u2019\u00e9quipe de mod\u00e9rations. Les insultes, commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants et les attaques ne seront pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9s. Si vous insultez ou attaquez les mod\u00e9rateurs via des commentaires ou des messages priv\u00e9s, vous serez bannis sur le champ.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, nous allons r\u00e9primer durement les publications ou les commentaires attribuant, sans preuves solides, la cause d\u2019un probl\u00e8me aux immigrants ou \u00e0 un sous-ensemble de ceux-ci. Cela inclut toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une zone \u00e0 forte immigration (par exemple Brampton) ou toute autre forme sous-entendus racistes. Ceci inclus aussi attribuer \u00e0 un groupe ethnique les fautes d\u2019un individus (Ex. la personne sugg\u00e9rant l\u2019utilisation des banques alimentaires pour sauver de l\u2019argent). Message aux racistes: vous n\u2019\u00eates pas aussi subtil que vous le pensez.\n\nEt avant toute plainte, faites-le valoir : [Non, votre droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9](https://xkcd.com/1357/).",

            "Some of the key takeaways from this OpEd:\n\n>I remember romping through Raymond Moriyama\u2019s modernist concrete halls and lanes, gazing through windows (dotted with bird silhouettes) at the majesty of the ravine, and wandering into the maze of fascinating and fun exhibits where you could happily lose hours to learning.  \n>  \n>Many of us will recall it as the best kind of \u201ceducational experience\u201d \u2014 the kind that provides large dollops of sugar to help the medicine go down. The kind that feels more like a trip to the fair or a giant playground. The kind you might prefer to a trip to the playground.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>And now, suddenly, it\u2019s shuttered because no one, in successive governments from different parties, gave enough of a crap to maintain the place.  \n>  \n>There was a plan to shut it down anyway, of course \u2014 for the same reason but on a longer schedule \u2014 that will move it to much smaller digs at Ontario Place. Of course, that site is itself another example of the same phenomenon. Ontario Place, the former public theme park, opened in roughly the same era as the Science Centre, to similar fanfare as a proud asset the provincial government could provide for its citizens. Then left to stagnate and eventually shuttered, and allowed to rot in place until there\u2019s little choice but to move on and try to start something else from scratch.  \n>  \n>That one too, was a repository of nostalgia, where childhood memories (and the possibility of creating more for a new generation) have been discarded on the great scrap heap of parsimony.  \n>  \n>There are other, arguably more important areas where the same dubious strategy is paying the same dubious dividends. Canadians were long prouder of our health-care system than of almost anything, and yet we have let it deteriorate. Our schools are, one trustee said this week, \u201cmanaging decline.\u201d Our transit system has seen one entire rapid transit line lost to a neglect-caused derailment, and this week another, larger one, was forecast as a possibility unless the federal government steps up with dollars in a hurry.  \n>  \n>Piece by piece, place by place, we see the cost of trying to save money in the short term by not taking care of our stuff over the long term.\n>\n>...\n>\n>As I said before, most of the lessons we all learned at the Science Centre in our childhoods were effortless, and joyful. This lesson, the kind we should have internalized in childhood, about what happens to things if you don\u2019t take care of them properly, is stunningly different. \n\nThis is a critical point. We see so much evidence of this neglect of our civic and cultural institutions and structures. There's always a choice when decisions need to be made about what to spend on new things and what to spend on maintenance. The first is sexy and gets media attention and politicians and organizations love it for that reason. The second gets no such attention, and frankly we've done a terrible job explaining to the public why this is in many ways more critical: If you don't take care of what you have, you will lose it.",

Canada\u2019s elected officials over the past decades have used lowering taxes to pander for votes and then cut funding to services. On top of that, many of the cuts most Canadians don\u2019t even see or notice. \n\nThis is also all communicated through the \u201cprivatization will save money because the government is incompetent and bloated\u201d myth. The result is what the article describes.\n\nFinding a solution is tough and as a society I feel like we are getting into more desperate times which are making people more selfish, the consequence of which is even more of individual demand for lower taxes.
