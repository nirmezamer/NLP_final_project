            "![gif](giphy|Uue0deVjVil0vtMoWg)\n\nMan, not getting a new season within a year is going to feel weird, but honestly, it's what it used to be like, Rick and Morty isn't an easy show to make, and a 2025 release makes me more excited about what they're planning for this \"10 season arc\"",
            "Huh I thought they already ended the script for season 8. Oh well, gonna wait a little more",
            "What ever happened to less waiting between seasons?",
            "And I'm still here waiting for season 7 to come here in my country",
            "Just a reminder that we had to wait 3 and a half years between season 3 and season 4.",
            "Even more reason to be excited for 2025. While I wait for GTA6 to install, I can watch season 8 of Rick and Morty",
            "Ugh. It's JANUARY 2024.",
            "Damn. Back to two year breaks.",
            "Fuuuuuck that\u2019s too long to wait",
            "Really hoping this Rick and Morty anime has an English Dub.\n\nThe japanese feels unwatchable",
            "Interesting. They've been releasing one season a year for a bit now. I wonder if the writers strike impacted the release date.",
            "Tune in to Rick and Morty Season 8 in a year and half or longer.",
            "Imagine if GTA VI and Rick & Morty season 8 drop on the same day, it would be like humanity\u2019s greatest day.",
            "Hard to believe we're on our way to Season 8. Doesn't even feel that long.",
            "Hopefully it is a January/ February release but it'll probably be Summer",
            "Season 8 in 2025 while we get the anime this year? I\u2019m okay with that.",
            "Aw jeez",
            "Anyways, Rick and Morty is not the same anymore and it\u2019s kinda boring now with the new voices, episode ideas and stuff like that",

            "Oh man. I have never been more disappointed in my life.",
            "I\u2019m so annoyed they are wasting any time on an anime series. Who the fuck asked for that?",

            "They game of thrones\u2019d it like 2 seasons ago (I don\u2019t consider the show Rick and Morty post-roiland). \nSeasons 1-3 are goated and beyond that is a slow and long spiraling descent on Pirates of the Pancreas. \n\nFin",
            "I'm totally fine with that, considering the average time between seasons has always been around 14 months (besides season 3), this actually makes perfect sense, honestly I'm fine with being patient if it means the content will be good.\n\nnot a big fan of the whole anime thing, but it has its audience so I guess its not really for me.",
            "if they\u2019re gonna wait two years to release a new season, can they please try not make episodes like the S7 opener and the ice-T sequel?",
            "if season 8 doesn't come out right now I'll kill myself on live tv",
            "Great! Anime series will be interesting, different and unique, and then 2025 there\u2019ll be season 8. Rick and Morty doesn\u2019t need an immediate season 8 it can wait a year or so. Don\u2019t complain for a year wait for an entire season. Not that bad yall. Gives the animators a break also / more time to make better content. It\u2019s a good thing.",

            "If there\u2019s one thing about season 7 it\u2019s that they still had some fantastic episodes, some of the best in the show, but they had the most filler since season 4 (Poopy Got His Poop Back, Air Force Wong, Wet Kaut American Sunmer, Numericons) that honestly felt rushed out the door IMO.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to wait longer for better quality, more thought out episodes.",
            "This might be good",
            "Real fans will say too soon",
            "Hopefully someone animates something better between now and then",
            "That's kind of ridiculous",
            "I just want another interdimensional cable ep",
            "7 is already unwatchable due to the new voices, and they're continuing this shit? just let it die, or bring back the soul of the show.",
            "perfect i barely came back and on season 6\ud83d\udcaf",
            "Good. I hope it turns out a lot better than 7.",

            "Like the show, but the year long plus breaks are annoying. Hell last season I didn't even realize it came back until like 3 eposides in.",
            "Why? 7 looks terrible...",
            "Idk why but when I read most of the comments it sounds like rick",

Back in season 2, 3, 4 we used to have like 8k+ karma on the live thread, with the post episode thread hitting that same number in an hour. With season 5 being pretty mediocre and 6 almost as bad, I saw a massive drop in those threads. Post episode discussions were hitting like a few hundred karma and barely any comments after like a couple hours. Gone were the thousands of karma and comments of old.\n\nIt honestly all started with season 5, that's where I saw the numbers tank...",

            "The thing that confuses and kind of irks me is that supposedly the long waits between the older seasons had a lot to do with getting the writing done, but they've been ahead at least a full season on the writing for like 2 years now? So what gives? Things should have been speeding up not going back to slower.",
            "I guess I don't know why it takes so long to make a \"show like Rick and Morty\" other animated shows have one season a year. I'm not trying to be snarky. I'm just curious.",
            "Hopefully it will be early 2025.",
            "It will probably be early 2025, so about a year\u2026 I hope",
            "I was lucky that I got into the series when I did\u2026I only had to wait for Season 3 from 2015 \u2026.\ud83d\ude44\n\nI was honestly surprised at how quick the last few seasons were released, I got used to waiting at least a year and a half, i did not like that break mid season thing they were doing though. Still not as bad as the Season 3 premiere tease. It was genius from a marketing standpoint but it was cruel from my severe lack of patience standpoint.",
            "I mean the anime is coming out this year at least.",
            "I think a lot of shows got delayed by the writers strike. At least this season was supposed to be on schedule, instead of like, a year and a half, or maybe longer\u2026 for the early seasons",
            "No anime is easy to make lol. Just be glad it's not like the gaming industry waiting damn near a decade for a game to release......... waiting a few more months (well several) for season 8 will be a cake walk",
            "It's a simple enough show to make. They're just taking it in with lots of other projects instead. Solar Opposites, Krapopolis, Strange Planet, and more.",
            "> isn't an easy show to make\n\nI dont get why people are so defensive of this trash heap. Even the highest quality GOAT shows can stick to a release schedule/cadence. Without Roiland this show needs to fade out into the cosmic dust.",

            "There was a writers strike. Were you in a coma",
            "That\u2019s when the overlords have the upper hand. Somehow, maybe clout, they can make them wait until it\u2019s ready.",

So it was barely more than 2 years between the end of season 3 and the beginning of season 4. Season 2 and season 3 also had a 2 year gap. We've never had to wait more than 2ish years for a new season",
            "that\u2019s crazy because season 4 truly was not one of the best, definitely a step down from 3. 6 and 7 were great tho",

            "1: The anime series isn't being made by the same team, it's being made by a Japanese team.\n\n2: Me, I think it's cool as fuck, and seeing rick and morty in other mediums is really fun, gives Rick and Morty, a really cool concept, a way to explore new ideas, plus a Rick and Morty anime just kinda works, everyone loved the shorts.",
            "They aren\u2019t wasting time. We\u2019re getting MORE Rick and Morty. If you don\u2019t like anime, don\u2019t watch it. But it\u2019s absolutely not a waste of time and it probably doesn\u2019t affect the regular series release dates. \n\nIt could end up being really interesting, it might take place in another timeline, they might make it more serialized and lore driven. And the best part is, it wouldn\u2019t affect normal Rick and Morty at all because of the way the multiverse works. I will never understand why people love shutting things down before they know anything.",

I think itll be good for the VAs and the writing staff since they\u2019ll have more to work with, which will result in a more cohesive story, its got me pretty excited for the future lol",

            "Nearing the middle to end of season 7, some of the more high standing episodes have started to bring some attention back to the show. With the Rick prime/evil Morty lore related episode being the strongest hook for viewers that were out of the loop to come back to the show. People, even if they stop liking the show or forget about it a bit, will still generally come back to watch a story arc be completed so they get the gratification of having finished viewing all the important bits of lore in the show. Now people will be able to wonder: what is Rick going to do next? What will happen with evil Morty? What possible new plot lines and arcs could occur? And since they announced it will come out in 2025, taking longer then usual, people are going to get more hyped for it, as they will have high expectations and want to see what will come from this long wait. I also heavily doubt adult swim won\u2019t be hitting heavy with teasers and many advertisements to get more people to remember Rick and Morty exists and \u201chey I can watch that new season soon, took a bit longer then normal to make it, I wonder what the episodes are gonna be about\u201d",

            "HI. I've been writing the Rick and Morty comics for eons now (or four years, idk if four years is an eon. It IS like almost half of Rick and Morty's pop culture life though so ya know) and the answer is anything published by Oni has been officially commissioned by the show, and for the most part, each of them are stand alone.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of the ones you choose. If you know the show, you won't be lost with the comics, so just grab the one of these that sounds the best to you and go from there.\n\nThe first sixty issues are collected in volumes 1-11. Oni is rereleasing them as compendiums, and they're written by a variety of writers, but the first six are Zac Gorman and most of the rest are by Kyle Starks who is now very very beloved at Marvel/Image/DC. Excalibur/Catwoman/Harley Quinn writer Tini Howard is in the mix, as is Eternity Girl writer Magdalene Visaggio. Both are great. The first compendium can be found here, with a cover by Fred C Stresing, a dear friend of mine and probably my most common collaborator on these: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Compendium-Vol-1-3/dp/1637152507/ref=asc_df_1637152507/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=652542027758&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17970536145950503530&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-2022776494075&psc=1&mcid=b3769d9329fb3e7c97bc072cd0717ffe\n\nThen there's Rick and Morty presents-- usually a guest creator does a story concerning a side character. I've written Birdperson and Mr Nimbus, and to be completely honest, as a reader these are my favorites and where I personally began. A lot of different creators in short self contained stories. Here's Vol 1, but my work (Birdperson, Nimbus, Issue #100) can be found in volumes 3,4,5 respectively: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Presents-Vol-1-ebook/dp/B07QPXS589/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?crid=1Q90BT7QDAGJI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tnOXtImY3Y4tiQWrSdTkQUXnmD6l5NQ1Lc1qr7w5pyJ1ssRIFWtos2nU9S9BRVbLv8igptyGzrdYvtfd2dZ34xAjtid9UmlQTkzWwjAQVFbOkGdsO7muDBY-89ZKscU_Mtnej0uxcXXhwi9uihkJQ4B-3-4BgYXzxQs5IDHlNnVpQVyuG3TXPN6qVd_7Xm2ETpb8_PgRGXPkHCWkDTJcHA.VIUSpW-z_toir0JSszcmYZwcn3K3woXEzeewIGErl-Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=rick+and+morty+presents&qid=1714111474&sprefix=rick+and+morty+present%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-2\n\nThen beyond that there are the miniseries. Mr Poopy Superstar has a very Adventure Time/art comix vibe to it and is about my dear friend Mr Poopybutthole, Worlds Apart is about the slut dragons, Rick and Morty Go To Hell says it all on the title, I've written Rick's New Hat, my attempt to capture the chaos of a crossover with Rick fighting a space God after he gives him a hat that makes him dumb, and I'll allow my bias here and it'll be the one I link to), Crisis on C-137 is a parody of multiversal DC 80's epics, Pocket Like You Stole It is a Pocket Morty's comic and thus a Pok\u00e9mon parody by Tini Howard, Corporate Assets satirizes the marketing elements of the characters, Heart of Rickness is Rick crashing on a barbaric world with no technology, Meseeks PI, a Meseeks and Jerry noir written and drawn by Fred C Stresing, a Star Wars parody titled Infinity Hour, and Jim Zub's three crossovers-- Rick and Morty DND, Rick and Morty DND Vol 2, and Rick and Morty Vs Cthulu. Here's my own New Hat: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Ricks-New-Hat/dp/1620109824/ref=asc_df_1620109824/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=475772680074&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5362615239424640752&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-1186511562451&psc=1&mcid=fd054cc19a583cc6807f748b9658b078\n\nIn 2023, along with Fred C Stresing and Marc Elletby as artists, we relaunched the Rick and Morty ongoing. It lasted 12 issues before pivoting back to minis, but I'm proud of them! They're collected as Space Shake Saga, about Rick being challenged by a genius Goldenfold, fighting a parody of a Web 3.0 creep, fighting his version of the Fourth World Saga, all while Morty falls in love with Goldenfold's niece. Although we revisit a few characters I created in other comics here, these can be read without any prior knowledge of the comics: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Vol-Space-Shake-ebook/dp/B0CN9MQBVZ/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?crid=2VQQS7KLUMW7J&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p3krpjrGu3CFYMawQejuAPHV39D3DMEVHG79s9HabeeYSA3MwUer6YMsG_Jhg-1Gs0fn2MzZf-to4lwfU7xOQFioctcRq7hJl86m65ZVnsolyg64TVm76JG2XRi10Qq5xHxcdwH7IegGTVaC1sToik64JyzBZDbtgquCG3JV_aJyKlMjKImhTFtIrb1NAIIKaTBCbNgNGsPsaNXZxn8hbg.RhKDfreeCDYj-c-8oPp-mfEVNgvT20naJQyMbewmefM&dib_tag=se&keywords=space+shake+saga&qid=1714112186&sprefix=space+shake+saga%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-4\n\nRight now the series is releasing three kinds of books. One is a special-- 56 pages long. The Spring Break Special was the first and so far only of these to be released and it's great (I have the 10th Anniversary Special with Fred to be released I July), a crossover with different creators titled Finals Week-- the first issue is written by legendary comedy writer Daniel Kibblesmith so you know it's good (I round out the series with the final issue) and the current miniseries is a very funny and very wild Kingdom Hearts parody titled Kingdom Balls.\n\nLastly, there is also a Rick and Morty manga being released that is very very funny. https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Manga-Vol-Robot/dp/1637152418/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=2UAW4H2S2Q57K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EH-DCkqBxWPvGSvigwpKbZtrsfp07kUCyODI5Fto-HrA3lsk6rrcp8CqOUmztzFxbFc4q-vd-MVnJuIk_fnVP6Qng_ubsk0BcUTMpaa7QLklCmMHHSHjwViAbOfaR6nXPb_dop46xUh2w43TQin90CM7Wdng-BHLBlfkHsodXJOGZWBwazS52oq_MORTj0jkJtbgrowNL8QkOhCiwsmv_g.P-hG8NuLjfZYc2rXCMPZYuClJtM2cUwgaCpRwaGLb94&dib_tag=se&keywords=rick+and+morty+manga&qid=1714112434&sprefix=rick+and+morty+manga%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1\n\nAgain, there's clearly been a lot, but keep in mind, the comics started publishing in 2015. That's about 9 years of Rick and Morty stories. Everything here is official, all approved by Adult Swim and such.\n\nI should also mention before a fan jumps in, that the absolute favorite of the comics series is a three issue arc where Rick and Morty are bested by Doofus Jerry, the Jerry from the Doofus Rick universe who is a savage evil capitalist. That guy keeps appearing all over the place. He's in volume 5 here: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Vol-Kyle-Starks/dp/1620104164/ref=asc_df_1620104164/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=266118805355&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18166552077347309587&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-415742700642&psc=1&mcid=061ec80332b73efc8b2d76c7c8b34063\n\nAlright that's me, I got tagged, I kept going, and I'm sure other readers will chime in with their own favs! As they should! Hope this helps. It's a lot but just choose the ones you like and go from there. It's Rick and Morty, so if you know the show these should be no problem.",
