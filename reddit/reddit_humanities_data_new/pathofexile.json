I wonder if it was one that I alt spammed or bought without double checking.\nWith regards to dropping all evasion, it is possible, but I felt like most of my deaths were to one shots anyways (max phys hit is only like 25k). I know basalt would help that a bit but with phys hits that big I feel like avoiding or convert is way better than some more armor. I also wouldn't be able to swap out for vaal haste for speed on easy maps. I already swap out jade for onslaught for the same purpose.\nI did have a perandus jewel, but I ended up switching in the massive thread of hope there to squeeze in the auras. I could put it where my watchers eye is and remove one of the rare jewels though.",

Converted them to div 230 a piece,  bought a mirror with div leftover (around 450 div left after buying mirror to be exact).\n\n  Prlly about 30-40 raw div on the ground this league, too.     \n\n Add-in a mageblood,   a 150 Adorned....\n\n Basically what Im saying is luck does exist.  I didnt SS the drops but I have a mirror bow to prove it.",

            "Yup , thats exactly what i do . And to be fair i like standard , its like a sandbox of everything that was in the game at some point",
            "Because i dont want people to start saying \" Your bow have no tree ? \" or stuff like that , just let me be happy xd",
            "I dont even know if I would be able to go this far without trades . You rock !",
            "My futurs plan is to learn a lot more about crafting yea, thats gona be a damn journey lol",
            "Thanks :)",
            "Harvest was a nightmare to learn when it came out, it was too much of a challenge for me to dive into ahah . But you are right",
            "Thats fine in my book !",
            "As I said somewhere in the comment section I pretty much farm whatever crafters needs",
            "Its easier to farm a lot of currency in standard i think , just farm crafting materials for big boy players and gg !",
            "I'm sorry if you feel like u wasted your time",
            "What did you expect from the title?",
            "Yeah there's always something.\u00a0 Oh you have a 3 mirror watchers eye? Not even double corrupted?",
            "Good thing GGG didn't brick this archetype before you could finish!",
            "Holy crap",
            "I was very dumb ( i still am ) when i dropped a mirror so i did so many mistakes with the currency i made from it , but yea the feeling was intense ahah",
            "Then you're not done yet.",
            "I personally don't play it, but I've been playing wipe based games for a long time. Nothing against standard, just don't play it haha.",
            "No tree?   not finished",
            "A crucible tree on your bow would honestly be insanely powerful... like the jump isn't even comparable to every other weapon. Sounds more like you WANT it to be done so lowered the goal posts. Regardless, congrats but wish we could see a PoB.",
            "Now is honestly the time. Until last league, I maxed out at 93 or 94. Then I hit 97 sort of by accident on a coc ice spear that was just a blast to play. Now with scarabs and the shrine strat, you can take even pretty squishy characters to 100 pretty easily. I hit 100 on my deadeye last night. I was getting 3% experience per map, and I know I could have pushed it to 4 with some more tight play.",
            "All the right affixes?",
            "Damn bro went HC",
            "real question is what can you do for ME",
            "Can't imagine the dumb shit I would've bought at 400 hours",
            "To be fair i had a bunch of very lucky drops witch accelerated the process by a lot ! + some items that became legacy that i could sell . I also had a shit ton of divines when they made the \" ex/div changes \" . I think thoses 3 had the more impact on my journey",
            "Your bow have no tree ? Then it's not finished!",
            "So why make a post saying your character is finished when you knew before posting it, that it is missing huge power from a crucible bow?",
            "Yah most likely but I haven't played a single second of standard.",
            "No offense, but I hope you understand if all threads were like yours it would be chaos and you wouldn't be able to find anything, imagine all threads hidden behind clickbait titles.",
            "Probably a pob, or a character that is actually finished and not one that doesn't even have a crucible bow.",
            "Nek patch ice shot bricked",
            "I'm far from being done with the game ! Now I can focus on learning more specifics stuff like diving hard into the crafting system",
            "See, this is exactly the kind of guy who warrants NOT posting the pob.",
            "Hahahahhahahhaha",
            "Bruh, why would you even say something like that to someone?",
            "It\u2019s really great right now but before they nerfed 5 ways it was easy to achieve each league if you just dumped your end of league currency and were cool with sitting around for a couple hours watching YouTube lmao",
            "At max rolls on top of that",
            "And you are 100% correct about it xd",
            "Indeed xd",
            "I understand , to be fair i didnt know what title i could use . But i'll try to do better if i have to post again",
            "Because its the truth. Unfortunatley a lot of people think lying to people to make them happy is being a positive person lol",
            "Yeah figured that when you said 4x GA. \n\nBut damn\u2026. Impressive",
            "I dont want it to be done , i just achieved all my goals so its done in my mind . I dont post my pob because i dont want people to decide for me if my character is done or not . Its that simple . It's PoE at the end of the day, its impossible to have a perfect character for more than a week before someone found a new tech",
            "Hey, if you don't want it to be done set some more goals for it. I would highly, highly recommend a Crucible bow since mods like rampage are absolutely insane. Such a massive boost for (compared to what u have put in so far) a small(ish) investment - and allows you to keep going.",
            "Man some of you are obnoxious",
            "I will probably get one at some point just for the sake of it.  \nYou shouldnt be that downvoted you are kinda right . My mind is just like \" Who care about crucible tree they are not even in the game anymore \" for some reasons . I have some legacy items like a legacy Taste of Hate, they just werent part of my initial goals",
            "When downvote trains start the reddit hivemind mentality snowballs lol. My initial comment does come off a bit blunt/rude which usually just gets people to downvote everything said from thereon out. No worries though. \n\nI do the same thing with builds; set a goal and complete it. Kinda how you have to in poe or it's so overwhelming.\nBut when you get that itch to grind again and decide to go for it, you won't regret it - just stupid amounts of stacked up power. Plus, if you get 1 with rampage that's some fun =)"
