            "I really like the Roland pitch benders found on the SH101, Juno etc but I use pads because I suck at playing keys. I\u2019ve noticed that [entire assembly replacements](https://syntaur.com/Part-4496-Bender-assembly-Roland) are sold and I\u2019m wondering if I can build an enclosure for it and properly wire a midi connection at the end of it (I do control wiring type stuff at my job) to make myself an auxiliary pitch bender. \n\nDoes anyone know if the midi CC comes from the bender itself since it looks like it has a circuit board on it, or if that happens at the circuit board where it plugs into? I couldn\u2019t find any wiring diagrams that clarified this, so those would be helpful too. Any input is appreciated.",
            "I have been thinking for a while about picking up a used Digitone. I have read the relevant sections of the guide and manual on Elektron's website and remain a bit unsure about some details of the song mode. A song mode in which I can arrange full songs is make-or-break for me (hands will be playing guitar, so I can't perform most changes within a track manually). The music I play is a bit different than what I see most folks using the Digitone for so I haven't seen examples of what I have in mind. Hoping someone can help clarify a few things.\n\nAs I understand it, I have up to one hundred twenty-eight patterns (i.e., sixty-four-step sequences) in a project and ninety-nine \"rows\" in the song mode arranger. I am looking to confirm what that looks like in practice. Let's say I typically arrange songs with three or more discrete sections, each comprised of sixteen or thirty-two measures (so each section being four or eight consecutive four-page patterns of the sequencer), of which some sections may be repeated. Possible forms are AABACA, ABBACCA, ABCBCDDB, and the like. If I am following the literature correctly, each four-page pattern of the sequencer comprises a single pattern that fills one row in the arranger. So I would add those to the arranger to look something like A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, etc. If a section of a given track requires eight patterns, then each repetition of that section would take eight rows on the arranger. And if that song has eight such sections total (e.g., ABCBCDDB), then I would use sixty-four rows of the arranger to put the whole thing together. Does this look right? Is there anything I'm misunderstanding or should be aware of?\n\nMy apologies if this is all obvious to experienced Elektron users. I'm new to the terminology and want to make sure I understand how this works before buying an expensive new gadget.",
            "So there are a million and one \"tutorials\" on \"how to mix and master\" on youtube. Most of which are either clickbait or not what I'm looking for.\n\nMy workflow is live-oriented. I don't ever really intend to actually perform in public, but I like playing \"live\", sort of evolving stuff that is mostly unplanned. Importantly, I run my mix through my interface and Ableton rather than having a mixer with physical faders.\n\nWhat do other folks do to \"mix\" this sort of thing? I always end up in situations where one or another instrument is buried, and it's always while I'm in the middle of the groove and don't want to stop to fix it. Do I just need to plan ahead more and come up with distinct areas of the mix that certain synths will sit in, and pre-EQ those spots, and keep them there? Possibly with different saved templates for each instrument and variations of them?",
            "Somewhat long winded question...  \nI'm trying to play two different synths at the same time, by looping some arpeggios with a Keystep and then switching MIDI Channel and playing some leads on a different synth over top.\n\nTo try to facilitate this, I've been trying a Bastl Midilooper. I'd like to sync the Looper with the tempo of the arpeggios, so I've been using the Keystep's clock and sending it to the Midilooper.\n\nProblem is, when you press stop on the Keystep arpeggiator, it sends a stop signal to the MIDI looper and my loop stops, so I can't switch smoothly to playing the leads. And I want my arpeggio function turned off for leads.\n\nI've tried a few different devices, and I keep running up against this wall where you have to run the clock to use the arpeggiator, but then when you stop that clock, you stop the clock that is sync'ed across all devices including loop device.\n\nDoes anybody know of a workaround for this, where I can turn off my arpeggiator, but not stop all my synced MIDI clocks across the other devices?\n\nHope this question makes sense, please ask if you need me to clarify or elaborate. Would love to get a solution here.",
            "There are two very common synth concepts that I've bumped into on my journey so far that I am unable to find great educational materials on, and really just don't know what to do with.  \n\nAnyone who can share words of wisdom, a general framework or good videos on these topics (basics especially) would be greatly appreciated:\n\n1.  **Pitch / Note stuff** - How exactly does changing the scale, creating user scales, microtuning, and other pitch options work?  What are some fun excercises, examples I could start off experimenting with?  I am familiar with basic music theory and have played guitar for decades - so not looking for the \"this is what a note is\" answer, but more the applicability to synthesis?\n\n2.  **Sync/Line-In/Out** - Is sync basically just \"clock\" or is there more to it?  Line in/out is for sampling one device with another or using the effects of one device on the sound source of another.\n\n**Bonus third technical question**:\n\nI picked up the Gecho Loopysynth which I believe only has a headphone out.  If I want that headphone out to be a line out to record this instrument via my interface/DAW is there any device I need in between, or particular. settings I should be thinking about it, or is it no big deal, just do it and adjust to taste?",
            "Does anyone know when is the PolyBrute 12 expected to be shipping out?",
            "why is passing panned audio, in hardware, such a scarce thing?\n\nmost, if not all, analog/hybrid mixers i've come across, exclude panning from their direct & aux outs. so... you can pan the channels L/R, but once output through the direct or aux jacks, they are sent \"down the middle\". All the big Mackie mixers, Yamaha, even Behringer.\n\nmost analog synths, whether VC or DC, don't even include a panning option. everything is just \"down the middle\". \n\ni don't understand why its so hard to do, or ignored, to allow a signal to be sent out panned, so that it can enter the DAW or a pedal, panned.\n\nfor example, I want my Moog panned 50% left & to feed a delay pedal. next, I want my Korg panned 100% right & to feed a vibrato pedal.\n\ni've found no way to do this in the hardware domain.",
            "New owner of a Korg OpSix (mk2) here. Loving the instrument's interface and sound, but I have run into a bit of a snag and was hoping some of you may have a solution/answer.\n\n\nFor context, I wish to externally MIDI-sequence program changes on the OpSix. Looking at both [the manual](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/manual/0/946/5046/) as well a [this forum post](http://www.korgforums.com/forum/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=126196&sid=d34f8bcc7816e1451deeb2e06f13a8bb), this should be as easy as \n\n1. Setting the MIDI instrument's selected bank (ranging from 0-9), and\n\n2. Setting its corresponding program change (ranging from 0-98)\n\n\nHowever, no matter what device I use to sequence program changes and note events, it would appear as though the OpSix first triggers the note event, and THEN executes the program change. This, in essence, means that I cannot sequence simultaneous instrument (program) changes and note events. Instead, I seemingly have to first sequence the program change and THEN trigger the note I wish to play. \n\n\nI really hope that I am just being an idiot here and either missed something in the manual or the menus or just don't have a good enough understanding of the MIDI standard. Have any of y'all ever tried sequencing program changes and how did you go about it?\n\nEDIT: this behavior appears to be consistent regardless of whether i trigger program changes and note events from my m8 tracker or Ableton clips. So it appears to be \"the fault\" of the OpSix.",
            "I can't say for sure, but I think it would be very strange for the bend control to output CC. Fundamentally the pitch bend is just a pot with a sprung handle, so the board either just routes that on (3 pins) or has a DAC and I2C/SPI (seems much less likely); if it has more pins it might have more features (e.g LEDs). Looking at the link, it has 6 wires, so I guess that connector is meant to carry both pitch bend and mod wheel (2 pots with 3 terminal each).",
            "Your description is correct:\n\n\n* A step is a time unit of a sequence in which triggers can occur and represents a musical subdivision of tempo\n* A sequence is a series of up to 64 steps\n* A pattern is a set of sequences, one per track\n* There are 8 banks (letters) of 16 patterns (numbers) per project\n* A song is a series of songs rows, which indicate what the device will play and in what order\n* A song row has a number (ordering), label (textual name for reference), pattern (bank and number), repeat count, length (number of steps from pattern to play per repeat), tempo and mute states (which tracks are muted or not)\n* There are up to 99 song rows in a song.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the steps used by a sequence don't have to be 16th beats, but they represent the narrowest time division you can sequence with.\n\n\nAlso remember, song mode was not added to the \"digi\" family for a long time. This is because the device paradigm is fundamentally that of a performance sequencer and multitimbral synth. The design was for you to perform the sequencer like an instrument. This is facilitates by features like parameter locking and conditional triggers (trigger every N times around, or with a given probability). These features allow you to make a 16 step sequence of 16 beats that actually doesn't repeat for many bars; for a drum pattern, for example, you could have some triggers happen every bar, some very 2 bars, some very 4 bars and some every 8 bars turning your 16 step pattern into 8 bars worth of drumming. Repeat that across the 4 tracks and use the song row mute states and you can make a surprisingly complex arrangement with few patterns.\u00a0Using the device to notate out very extended sequences with every note placed manually, across multiple patterns, is not very efficient. In other words, what you want to do is possible, but not really the core intent of the device and not a flow it's optimized for.\n\n\nIf you aren't going to be interacting with the device while the song plays, then you need more of a backing track than a sequencer. I'd definitely try and clarify what you need to available to you, performance wise, as a backing track doesn't have the performance flexibility of a true sequencer/synth, but is very simple to work with. You also get the freedom to use whatever you want to make that backing track (e.g more guitar parts, synths you don't bring with you etc), and mix backing tracks with other devices if you want some elements to be manipulated in realtime and some not (assuming you have a good way to sync).",
            "I think there are a few things to consider here.\n\n\n1. The less you need to do in mix and mastering you need to do the better: this starts with composition, sound design and arrangement. Do each of those, with a mind to how everything will mix (ideally with level at 0db and no EQ).\n1. If you know for sure a certain channel will have a certain function, you can preset your EQ, for example turning the lows or the highs all the way down (don't try and refine unless you are only using one patch)\n1. Always design your sounds in a musical context and not solo: making them sound good when played alone isn't the goal.\n1. Consider having some effect sends, and sending everything to them at least a small amount: this can help add some coherence and ambience.\n1. Consider having a mastering chain on the main outs. I usually have a compressor, a stereo graphic EQ and a limiter (typically going to speakers and to an audio recorder).\n1. While I tend to tell people not to fixate on how synth X vs Y will work together, this matters much more for fully live setups: certain combinations of gear will feel like they fit better without much mixing, so find those.\n1. I would say that 4 instruments is about the upper limit for what you can get to work consistently in this context. More instruments tends to need more planning, pre making patches and explicit mix etc.\n\n\nHopefully these ideas will help you find something that works for you.",
            "I tend to make templates in Ableton that has the rough mix dialled in depending on what I'm using. You can use effects racks for this, but I tend to split by bass/drums/pads/everything else with some bog standard things on there depending on what genre I'm making.\n\nPart of having a template is getting the effects on send/return channels as I find that often glues stuff together a bit more. I'll normally just jam with a rough mix and then do a proper one later if I like what I've laid down. Doing it this way also lets me keep the dry signals when I'm recording, so if I want to change something I've not recorded the EQ (or whatever) into the track.\n\nI'll sometimes use an external EQ/comp/reverb/whatever before it goes into Ableton, but that's more for sound design than mixing.",
            "A couple options involving new gear:  Get a dedicated Clock device like CLOCKstep:MULTI and control clock messages and start/stop messages independent of any other gear.  Less clear for me in the situation as it's described, you can maybe get a box that can block Start/Stop messages, like a Plexus:4 or a MIDI Solutions Event Processor.",
            "It depends where you are. Best advice is to ask your local store.",
            "This is great, thank you for the very detailed answer. \n\nYou are correct that what I am seeking to create are essentially backing tracks. The simple way to do this is with a laptop (whether with instruments recorded live or programmed), which I use for this purpose when playing at home. I'm looking to get away from this for a few reasons.\n\nI don't need particularly complex accompaniment. What I'm aiming for is something like this: In the alternate universe where I have four arms (and am better at playing keys), I'd be playing rhythm with FM organ-like patches while playing melody on the guitar. In our two-handed universe, sequencing those sounds is the more viable approach. Part of the draw here is definitely the sounds I hear people make with the Digitone, though VSTs (or other hardware) can get close enough.\n\nI see a few real benefits to a MIDI-controlled synth over an audio backing track, mainly in the flexibility that you mention. Sometimes I play alone, sometimes with a friend covering bass. If playing alone, dedicating one track for a bassline and another to play rhythm or comp should be enough in most cases. If playing with him, it seems I could just mute the Digitone track I assign to bass and the two of us can play along with the synth playing chords for the two of us. And I'd still have another two tracks (in addition to the external MIDI tracks) to expand beyond that with pads, textural elements, harmony, etc. With sequenced MIDI controlling a synth, I can change the BPM without any loss in sound quality. This is useful for working out parts with something new or just wanting to try a song at a different tempo, for which backing tracks are not ideal (though there is a workaround in recording the same track at multiple BPM). The synth approach also allows changing the arrangement as desired.\n\nIn a sense, I guess I am trying to capture the benefits of using MIDI sequenced backing tracks without being glued to my computer. Given that I don't need a wide range of sounds/VSTs and that I'm aiming at playing live rather than production per se, ditching the computer for a sequenced synth seems feasible. Additionally, I already use a Toraiz SP-16, mostly for one-shot drum samples, and it seems like the Digitone could integrate with that nicely.\n\nYou raise a good point about the inefficiency of programming it. My thoughts, perhaps overly optimistic, are that if I plug in a MIDI keyboard, playing the notes into individual steps won't be too much of a hassle (though I've never sequenced an Elektron device so I could be underestimating the amount of button clicking and scrolling this requires), and more of the effort will be in setting per-step or per-pattern parameters. In a sense, not much more complicated than programming MIDI on a computer, plus it seems that I can facilitate some of the spadework with Overbridge.\n\nThis is definitely not what the Digitone was designed/optimized for. I don't play the genres that seem to be the natural or at least the common uses for it. I think I just have the sound in my head that I want to achieve and the thought that with a bit of a learning curve, this might be a reasonable way to do it.",
            "Thanks. That's basically what I had come to realize overall. most of my stuff I can at least turn the volume knob down on the unit itself for a quick fix, but that's more difficult with my DB-01 unfortunately (requires menu diving, why they thought that was a good design decision I'm not sure).\n\nAdding a compressor to my master track is probably not a bad idea. I should also probably map the Ableton faders and a few key parameters to some hardware for quicker access...",
            "Thank you.\n\nThat is the only solution I have though of, is to have a dedicated clock device such as Midronome or ERM Midiclock, at the start of the \"clock chain\", but I was worried that even with that, the Keystep will still transmit a \"stop transport\" type message when I turn off the arpeggiator, and still mess up the midiclock downstream of that device.",
            "One option to consider would be playing stems. Some type of multi track recorder such as the zoom r16, or Tascam model 12 could work. These let you make arbitrarily long multi track recordings which play back as though being played into a mixer (giving you level faders and the like). In this way you could put stems on the device and get the ability to bring parts in and out or adjust levels. Changing tempo isn't possible on this case, but I'm not so sure that a live show is the best place to experiment (i.e make some alternate material in advance instead)\n\n\nThere are a few other devices that might be able to achieve similar things such as the SP404 or the 1010 bluebox/blackbox, perhaps even an Octatrack. Some of these can adjust tempo on the fly, but quality definitely suffers. I'd definitely check them out as options, in any case, as you'd be able to export a DAW project (including the parts you'd play live) and make a mix on stage. This lets you adapt to the ensemble and even offers flexibility for you to play different music roles (e.g drop out the bass part and play it live on a synth).\n\n\nIf you are sold on the overall concept of the Digitone, but less sure of the workflow, you might be interested in one of the \"DAW in a box\" type of devices such as the Akai Force, Maschine+ or Push 3 standalone. These include lots of synthesis options, but are more geared toward a DAW like flow, meaning making longer parts is much more comfortable vs on an elektron box.",
            "These are great suggestions to consider. Thank you. Perhaps worth seeking out a store that would have floor models of some of these to compare interface/ease of use for the real-world use I'm imagining. The \"DAW in a box\" devices in particular I've found appealing for a while though I've never used one personally. If you have experience with any of those you mentioned, what would you say makes it more comfortable to make longer parts vs. something like the Digitone? Just the ability to record full sections/more than four measures at a time (assuming 1x scaling on an Elektron) and not having to string smaller parts together? Or is there other workflow-related functionality that isn't obvious to me?\n\nI suppose with the Push in particular, I could just record parts live into Ableton, edit, arrange, and export to use that as an all-in-one controller for live playback/performance. All else being equal, that sounds like an excellent option for what I'm doing. Though the standalone version would be a pretty big jump in price from a used Digitone. At that point, I could buy a refurbished Macbook dedicated to Ableton use (frankly, not a terrible option though it feels a bit excessive; would still be on a computer but not the one I use for work and worry about bringing out and about) and still have enough left over for a used Digi- device lol. There is a question of whether its functionality is worth the cost for me. Good to think through my options here in any case.",
            "The DAW in a box devices have the concept of arbitrarily long midi clips, and arrangement (putting those clips on a timeline) vs a song concept. This allows for much more logical subdivision of musical elements into sections (vs 64 steps patterns).\n\n\nAbleton (and hence push) in particular has the concept of follow actions for clips and scenes, so you can even put the entire arrangement in the clip launcher (vs on the timeline); this has the big benefit that you can choose to do things like stick to a section for longer (e.g to extend a solo), skip sections or otherwise rearrange on the fly.\n\n\nThe force has an arrangement view, but it's like the arranger view in Ableton. It has clip launch too, but not as fancy as the one in Ableton. Machine+ I haven't really used, so I can't comment on that too much. A used Akai Force is probably a good value option if you want to try the setup out; seems like you could get one for under $500.",
