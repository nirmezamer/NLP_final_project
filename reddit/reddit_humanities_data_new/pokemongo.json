            "Is anyone else having hitbox issues where excellent and sometimes even great throws don't work?",
            "What happened to excellent, great and nice throws? Seems waay harder to actually get them.",
            "Just redownloaded after over a year and I\u2019m level 32 with 3 pokemon over 3k and the rest between 2700-2000. What should I do/prioritize to get better and better pokemon? Don\u2019t really have anyone in person to play with and can\u2019t solo any good raids",
            "Do you go out of your way to do a raid every day or do you get rid of healing items?\nI do the team rocket battles every day but I don't raid more than like twice a week.\nIt seems like my backpack is filled with healing items but I have a tough time letting go of them.\u00a0 Do you all have a use for all those healing items or do you just toss them?",
            "Is it just me or was there an option to sort stickers by quantity for like a couple weeks and then they got rid of it? I thought losing that option was due to me getting a new phone but now it\u2019s been months and I still can\u2019t sort stickers by quantity so did they just get rid of it for everyone?",
            "Stopped playing in 2016 after a disappointing release and repetitive gameplay. I see the field has expanded to 700+. How has the game changed since then and is there reason to download the app again?",
            "I almost will level up to trainer level 41... let's say I wanna wait for my son to be level 41 as well... let's say he reaches lvl 41 and I want him to be 42 before me... I hold my tasks, but I get enough EXP to level up (after I complete all tasks), what happens to the extra EXP? does it counts for next level or is it lost?",
            "Would the gold box with 99 raid passes for 5425 coins be the best in gonna find?",
            "So, how important are the stars? Having more stars is better, but I read once that their effect is not that substantial. Just debating whether I should keep up my practice of chucking everything that doesn't have 3 stars, since I'm still in the process of getting adjusted back into the game.",
            "My dad just called to say that he saw me in a raid lobby. My username, my avatar. I was NOT playing at the time, I am not friends with that user. He insists it was my name and exact avatar, though. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t believe it except earlier I was showing up twice in a remote raid lobby in a raid I was actually doing. That one, I easily wrote off as a glitch, but my dad seeing me in a lobby (when I was out of remote raid passes and not even playing the game at the time) kind of freaks me out. Has this happened to anyone else? All of these were remote Yveltal raids.",
            "Do we know when origin formes of dialga and palkia are coming back?",
            "Graphic Bug, Reduced rewards from route\u00a0\n\nIf you travel the required distance for a route, or more, you get 100% rewards ( you can see this with the only non random rewards \u2796stardust, and XP \u2796 remain the same )\u00a0\n\nBut you get a warning for reduced rewards \u00a0( none of our community members have completed a route without the warning )\u00a0\n\nIf you do not meet the minimum distance of the route, you actually get reduced stardust, XP, and a reduced loot table ( appears to be distance travelled ex: 600 m gets you the loot table for 600 m routes )\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udd32",
            "Question - is it possible for people to cheat using location apps? I have this character in my village who will knock me out any gym I take over within minutes! Makes it impossible for me to earn coins and just ruins the game for me. Doesn't matter what time of day I take over a gym he will knock me out in about 5-10 mins. I've hung around at gyms before and never see anyone nearby who looks like they are playing the game. I need advise because I love the game but this is killing it",
            "So with the hatch distance change for the event, I put one of the 12 km in a regular incubator to see how long it would take. Then I put one in a super incubator. Why is the super incubator taking longer? It\u2019s 4km vs the regular one being 3km",
            "Does the lake trio have a boosted spawn rate right now? I just caught one so I have to assume they do, but didn\u2019t find anything when I googled it.\u00a0",

            "I just did the steps to get my buddy excited without a poffin. How do I get the other hearts for feed? I'm at 3 out of 6 and giving him berries isn't granting hearts, presumably cause he's already excited?",
            "E: Solved\n\nAre Tags just completely gone for anyone else? They are not in the option for individual pokemon, or when you multi-select, and the tab on the pokemon screen is not there anymore either.",

After a while they MIGHT respawn and if you touch the screen they sometimes dissappear again.\u00a0\n\n\nPhone and pokemon go has be restarted. Any solutions?",
            "So for GoFest how was the raid split in regards to the ratio of Necrozma raids to other UBs  \nFollow up question - if your ticket was only 1 day were you able to get shinies on the other day, so like since I have saturday NYC ticket will I have shiny chances on Sunday?",
            "If I spend 50k stardust and teach slaking a new move will it use that move during defense or does it just default use the original charged attack move?",

            "Hello so I live in Japan (not sure if time zones matter for the website) and I added a few Pogo calendars to my google calendar so I can keep track of when events are happening. It seems that everything is shifted an entire day (it is currently Tuesday and it says the spotlight hour is on Wednesday and raid hour on Thursday). I didn't know if anyone has experience with setting these up to work properly or might have suggestions for other calendar systems I can try out that might be better then\u00a0[https://gocalendar.info](https://gocalendar.info/)\n\nAlso... why is the main feed full of people posting their catches. While questions like the ones on this post auto deleted? This isn't a \"pogo trophy\" subreddit.",

            "I became best friends with someone yesterday and got a notification about becoming lucky. My immediate response to all popup messages is to click them away so I didn't read properly. The friend doesn't appear with the golden \"frame\" in my friends list (I opened gifts today to trigger it).\n\nWas it just a message that we now are able to become lucky friends?",
            "Have I just missed it or has there not been a description of GoFest yet?  Like the featured mons and the different habitats/times, etc.\n\nSeems really late to me.  And yes, I follow LeekDuck and other accounts that usually do the explainer graphics.",
            "Well it\u2019s 7 day streak and Field research day for me, hopefully I get a Sinnoh Stone or 2. You know, the only useful stone type item. \n\nIt\u2019s a single Dragon Scale for the 3rd week in a row.",
            "When it comes to Shadow Pokemon, do I assume I want to keep only those with 3 stars (or more) and transfer the rest? Or am I underestimating their value?\n\nAlso, if a Pokemon is barely creeping into each of the three stats during Appraisal, although it's a 2-star, is it worth keeping or not?\n\nEDIT: One more question: When considering Pokemon to keep, I imagine I want to keep at most three of a single species, two for the respective Great and Ultra tiers of battle and one for raids/master? Or is that not optimal?",
            "Would appreciate some advice for someone level 30 with only like 8 or 9  2.5k+ pokemon. I have one teammate (my daughter) and we are trying to learn how to get better so we can finally take down 3 and 4 star raids. any advice on how to do this? Or do we need to dave coins for remote raid passes?",
            "does the mystery box pokemon home meltan feature still work? I tried doing it but i never got a mystery box",
            "Does the Yveltal have Oblivion Wing this time around?",

            "I've been playing for a few months but still feel like im in the noob phase.  I can tackle 1 star raids on my own but struggle on anything higher.  Have a few scattered questions I'm hoping to get some help with:\n\n1. How do folks priortize which pokemon they invest in?  (CP, IV, Type, \"best in slot\" mons, etc)\n\n2. How big of an active roster do folks keep for different activities? (gym battles, gym defense, raids, etc)\n\n3.  I'm familar with shadow pokemon now but I've seen another icon for even stronger pokemon, looks a bit like a tear or a DNA strand, goes from purple - blue - green.  What does this mean and how do I find pokemon like them?\n\n4.  I'd like to progress more in raids, how do i best prepare and take them on?  I think I saw something about Rayquaza coming up in raids, I'm not too familiar with the meta but I imagine he ranks pretty high up there but I'm not sure how much of a shot I have at him.",

            "I am a lapsed user that is level 40 and returned a few weeks ago, immediately delving into route creation. Alas after about 14 routes submitted it is now telling me that I cannot create a new route at this time.\n\n\nAny word on what the limit is and when I can submit new routes? I am a frequent jogger so this is a fun way to follow (and encourage others to follow) local trails.\n\n\nI hope my overzealousness didn't result in me getting barred from route submissions ;(",

            "Have Niantic made changes to the Daily Incense recently, I've noticed a drop in the number of Pok\u00e9mon appearing plus how many I catch during the incense has noticeably dropped to a handful. Has anybody else noticed?",
            "I only just finished \"Finding your voice\" a few days ago and caught Meloetta but her summary is bugged. I tried restarting my game, and have played every day since but it's still bugged. This hasn't happened with any of my other pokemon. https://imgur.com/a/hcwH0aP Here's a picture of the bug. Is there a way to fix this or has anyone else dealt with this?",
            "What are the best ways I can get 10K eggs to make sure I get a charcadet?",
            "Are 2, 5, and 10km eggs random with pokestops/gym spins?",
            "I haven't played since launch, and started a new game. How do i battle pokemon? I have so many pokemon, yet i haven't been able to use them yet. \n\nIs it possible to battle a wild pokemon?",

            "I have a person in my friends list who keeps sending me gifts but I can\u2019t send gifts back. The game always says they haven\u2019t opened my last gift, but I thought it was impossible to send someone a gift without opening theirs first. What is going on?",
            "Long time player, first time encountering this issue. I've walked about 2km yesterday to hatch eggs with adventure sync on, caught plenty of pokemon and hit plenty stops but it's only added 0.1 to my distance travelled on the eggs and my buddy. Is this a bug?",
            "I keep getting login issues, failed to login/unable to authenticate.\n\nI can only fix it by reinstalling the app, just clearing the cache does not work.\n\nUnfortunately it keeps happening every few days, is this a known problem and if so is there a permanent solution?",

            "They got broken in the latest patch, which was recently force updated for all.",
            "Yes! I've tried posting pictures on here, but the flair system won't let me",
            "Start by downloading the Pokegenie app. You can host raids on your local gyms and get remote players to help beat them. That's an easy way to start building a better team.\n\n\nTo catch up it would be good to try leveling up more and to hunt for good shadows. Swinub, Houndor, Piplup, Darumaka, Pidgey, Starly, Ralts, Cranidos, Draini, Bagon, Gible, Totodile, Drilbur, Magikarp and Sneasel will be the more useful of this rotation,\u00a0 Shadows are strong, so they can help you beat raids alone.\n\n\nWe're having the Global Go Fest in less than a month, so putting Pokemon in gyms and saving coins is also a priority. Both Necrozma fusions are a very good addition to any team, but you need to do a lot of raids to get the materials, and that means you'll need a lot of coins to buy passes.\n\n\nThe rest is just keeping an eye on the today and news section inside the game, or to look at leekduck event schedule to see what's coming and what to focus on.\n\n\nAlso check the event post is r/thesilphroad. There useful guides for each that will help you understand the bonus and goals better.",
            "I try to raid every day or every two days when I have 2 free daily passes. Most of the time I want the raid boss. More often than note the XP, stardust, and RC.\n\nIn terms of revives and potions\u2026.i keep a minimum of 50 revives and 50 max revives. I have a lot more potions. I keep the blue and light pink ones. Keep the yellow and dark pinks only if you have absolutely nothing. Lots of players are complaining about like of potions and revives because these items or not given out much.\n\nI end up tossing a lot of my because of raids and because of gives from in game friends.",
            "I raid 5-7 times a week and do grunts everyday and I have 300 max revives, so, no, you don't get rid of them.\n\nIt is hard to get go of certain items but I have set a limit for each potion/revive and trash everything above that. What numbers work for you depends on your playstyle (how many pokestops you spin and gifts you open everyday for example) and the size of your backpack.\n\nI have NEVER run out of revives but my kids never have enough.. And I think it's due to their inability to plan ahead and manage their resources. They battle every grunt they come across despite having 50 fainted mons and no revives.",
            "Especially with Poke Genie, Pokeraid, and other raiding apps you can reduce need for healing items since remote raids attract high level players and 3+ high level players make raids faster\u00a0\n\nFinding an active community in campfire, especially with a community ambassador, can help since 9+ high level raiders can make raids faster\u00a0\n\nHaving 40+ active friends sending you gifts daily helps with getting max revives and max healing potions ( both of the above are good ways to get more active friends )\u00a0\n\nUsing a Plus+ while driving past gyms helps get healing items\u00a0\n\nFor 30x days, track your potions use, potions from gifts, and healing items from Plus+ then see how much you use each 5x days and how much you gain each 5x days to see what kind of buffer you need due to Merciless RNG\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I did the math, and with the above, I keep 280 max revives, and 330 max healing potions, as a Merciless RNG buffer and discard everything else\u00a0",
            "There is no comparison between Pokemon Go in 2024 and 2016. Its pretty much a completely different game. There are so many systems to participate in now, compared to launch when all you could do was try to catch Kanto pokemon in the wild, and then a terrible gym system that excluded 99.9% of players.",
            "It depends on your area. If you have plenty of gyms and stops you will be ok. Even though there is over 800 pokemon available in the game, you will only see the same 10-20 that rotate during events because they have to milk the game for years",
            "All exp is saved even if over the level requirement so there is nothing to worry about",
            "Its one of the best deals on a pass per coin metric ever. Its certainly the best you can find right now in the daily rotating boxes.",
            "For raids, it's less important than species, level (how much it's powered up, roughly the CP), and moveset. However, it's still useful for a tiebreaker. Pick the highest IV with max attack for raids. Some people also feel bad investing so much into something that's got bad IVs. A lot will depend on how play style. If you're more casual, it's fine to use whatever you can find. Someone who raids twice a day may be more picky knowing they'll find something better.\n\nOnw very important thing though is that simply picking the highest star appraisal isn't the only thing. If you ever play GO Battle League, you may find that a low attack, high defense, high HP is better. \n\nIt's actually a fairly common regret from some players who only kept \"good\" ones  only to find their 15/15/15 Azumarill is actually ranked very low compared to something like a 8/15/15 one.",
            "There's a rare bug where players see shadow copies of themselves on the lobby. It looks pretty weird to see more than one of yourself, but it's only a visual error.\n\n\nHaven't heard about seeing other players you know on your own raids, but might be related. Did you use party play or raided together before this happened?",
            "Change your password?",
            "No.",
            "Yes. That's called \"spoofing\". They will use certain apps to fake their location to play as if they were in a remote area. Niantic has banned people periodically, but it's a moving target, so people will move onto the next area, the next app after one gets blocked.",
            "There's a special bonus right now where you get 1/4 distance for the first 3 eggs that you incubate using the Egg Widget. Sounds like the egg widget bonus applied to the one in the regular incubator, but not the one in the super incubator.",
            "Ever since the biome update they became much more common than before. They're still very, very rare, but not on the one in a hundred million chance every hour they had before. It's unknown if it will be permanent, but for now they're easier to find.",

All the moves a Pok\u00e9mon has will be used as attack moves.",
            "Yes, it will use it sometimes.\n\nThe way gym defense works is that the game picks between available moves randomly each time it takes a \"turn\" to use a move. This will be the fast move every time until its charge move is ready. Then it seems like it's got a 50/50 chance to use its fast move or charge move. If you have two charge moves available and ready, it'll randomly pick between all 3.\n\nIf your two charge moves cost the same number of bars, they will be equally likely to be used. But if one is more expensive, then it's less likely that the mon will still have energy last until it's ready, especially if it's a one bar move.\n\nI'll also note that slaking in particular is a garbage tier gym defender. It's high CP means it decays really fast so it often just needs one attack to take down. But even if starts maxed, yawn means it doesn't get off many charge moves before Machamp et all knock it out. It's very quick and easy for a seasoned gym attacker to take them down. \n\nHaving body slam is really the only way it deals any damage to the attacker, and that's resisted by fighters like terrakion or Lucario. Not worth etm for sure.",

            "A zero star shadow is more powerful than a 4 star regular or purified, and a level 30 shadow is as strong as a max level 50 regular or purified.\n\n\nThey are much stronger on raids, so you don't necessarily need them to be 3 stars to be good. A max attack 1 star would be almost as good as a 4 star good, because attack matters more than anything else.\n\n\nFor keeping, no, it's different for every species. Many don't have any PvP use, and some don't have any raids use. There's not a fixed number to keep of each.\n\n\nFor example Swampert is excellent in Great League, good in Ultra, useless in Master and pretty good in raids as a mega.\n\n\nIn comparison Blaziken is somewhat good in Great, bad in Ultra, useless in Master and very powerful in raids as a mega.\n\n\n\nThen you have Lickitung, which is powerful in Great, too weak for Ultra, too weak for Master and too weak for raids.\n\n\nAnd finally you have shadow Tyranitar. Useless on Great, bad in Ultra, only somewhat viable in Master, but excellent on raids.\n\n\nSo no, different Pokemon work on different places. You might need only one, two, three or none. For some\u00a0you might want five because they're simply very good in raids and you can make a team with them.\n\n\nFor PvP check the rankings on PvPoke.com and see if they're viable or not in each league.

            "It will be difficult to do high level raids if you don\u2019t have the right Pok\u00e9mon with the right moves. So you want to have Pokemon Teams built around a particular raid boss.\n\nI am providing a link to GamePress. It\u2019s a website that helped me a lot when I was starting to play the game and it might help you and your daughter.\n\nhttps://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/\n\nOnce you and your daughter are at level 30 with the right Pok\u00e9mon and moves, you guys should not have a problem doing a level 30 raid. If you want to solo the tier 3 raid it can be done but it\u2019s like it would be somewhat difficult. If you\u2019re a level 35 and above, soloing a tier 3 would not be much of a problem if any. But again it requires the right Pok\u00e9mon and moves.\n\nLegendary raids, mega raids, elite raids, and to a certain extent level 3 shadow raids it would be recommended you do as a team effort with 3 or more people. Some of these raids can be done by 2 players but under right circumstances. Level 3 shadow raids would be likely the easiest to accomplish but it would be best for both of you to be at around level 35 and have best friends status.\n\nI may have missed some stuff but hopefully you have some basics.\n\nFor harder raid bosses you will need to host or be invited to raids. Hosting will be a little bit more difficult than being invited but if you and your daughter want to play together you will need to host the raid. Try using PokeGenie and the Pok\u00e9mon Go Friends subreddit. It should be easy enough to try to host but you may need to Google a tutorial on YouTube.",

            "1. Prioritize pokemon that are top counters for raids, or highly ranked in PvP. This thread has an infographic in it showing a lot of good options for raid counters, though many aren't currently available. Need to be on the lookout for them to come back to raids and events.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1bspkt9/best\\_raid\\_counters\\_per\\_type\\_anti\\_type\\_april\\_2024/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1bspkt9/best_raid_counters_per_type_anti_type_april_2024/)\n\nIVs don't matter too much. Pokemon have 3 hidden base stats, attack, defense, and stamina/HP. These are in the 1-300 ranges. IVs add a small value to this large number, from 0 to 15. Then the sum is scaled down based on its level. Finally, a CP number is calculated from the actual hidden stats, with attack factoring in much more than defense or stamina. Overall,   IVs can contribute from like 3 to 6% of the final stat number, depending on the base for the species.\n\nSpecies, level, and moveset are 95% of what determines performance in all parts of the game. IVs are just a little tweak at the end.\n\nTo get good starter raid teams, look for \"budget\" counters from that infographic, or on [pokebattler.com](http://pokebattler.com), that can be found in the wild. Try to catch them with weather boost, up to level 35. You can evolve them in place without spending any dust, and get a team that's like 85% as good as a full roster of level 50, 100% IV shadow legendaries.\n\nOnce you've got that going for all relevant types (ignore normal, deprioritize poison, psychic, flying), you can start to look into powering up shadows and legendaries to replace them over time to eek out marginal performance gains.\n\n2. At least 6 of every type for raid teams, sometimes 12. Except for normal, that's always useless (outside of flaky party play shenanigans). \n\nGym defense might need upwards of 20 pokemon, but you don't need to really power anything up for that unless you're competing in an area where people are constantly attacking gyms right away.\n\nPvP can go really deep, depending on how much you want to get into it and participate in limited format cups. 3 mons for each league can get you by if you just play it casually. And the master league ones can overlap with raid counters.\n\n3. Are you looking at [Mega or Primal evolution](https://www.pokemon.com/uk/strategy/a-guide-to-mega-evolution-in-pokemon-go)? That is a temporary form that lasts for 8 hours, and requires farming mega energy for each eligible species from raids or pokestops. \n\nIts primary use is to boost candy and XL candy odds for catching things that match the pokemon's typing, or 3 types for kyogre/groudon/rayquaza based on their weather lore. You also get nice team damage bonuses in raids if you need the extra oomph, and the mega evolved mon itself gets a big stat boost.\n\n4. Mega Ray will be difficult. Mega legendary raids are always boosted in difficulty, and elite raids are also always boosted in difficulty. It remains to be seen if an elite mega raid is double boosted, or not. \n\nYou should try to coordinate with your local community to get in 5-6 raids that day to get enough energy to mega one, because mega Rayquaza is one of, if not the, most powerful pokemon in the entire game. We will get one free meteorite from timed event research, and dragon ascent makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nAs a flying dragon, [Ray](https://www.pokebattler.com/raids/RAYQUAZA_MEGA) is double weak to ice. Try to get your mamoswines and glaceons ready to go. Any high level spare eevee you have sitting around make for a really strong anti-ray team. Just need to visit an icy lure to evolve them. Mamoswines (esp. shadow) are stronger, but glaceon isn't that far behind. \n\nCan also use things like cetitan and weavile if you have high level ones, its just that eevee is very commonly available and easy to have.",

            "There's the XL goals series like this one to tell what's good to have Megas active for.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1dgsi6p/xl_candy_goals_spelunkers_cove/\n\n\nAnd the event goal guides that are more general about what to do in each event to get the most out of it for PvP and PvE.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1dg8gbh/what_to_do_during_spelunkers_cove_vol_7/\n\n\nMaybe these are what you saw that time?",
            "I\u2019m not sure what your situation is. I do a combination of soloing, duoing, hosting, and being invited to raids.\u00a0\n\nEveryone can do a level 1 raid.\n\nShadow level 1 raids isn\u2019t a problem either but still best to have some powered up Pok\u00e9mon not anything major.\u00a0\n\nYou could do level 3 raids but you do need the right Pok\u00e9mon with the right moves. The Pok\u00e9mon needs to be at least level 30. It would be somewhat of struggle.\u00a0\n\nShadow level 3 raids you would likely have difficulty.\u00a0\n\nIf your Pok\u00e9mon are at level 35 and above being able to do level 3 raids would be definitely easier. Your Pokemon at level 35 would likely be fine for shadow level 3 raids.\u00a0\n\nGenerally it will be difficult to complete legendary, mega, and elite raids by yourself no matter what level you are. But under the right circumstances you might be able to do these raids with yourself and another person.\u00a0\n\nI am putting a link for you. For me this website helped a lot. If you search a bit it can tell you best Pok\u00e9mon to have but also raid boss guides. Type in a \u201craid boss\u201d and it can tell you what to use at what level your Pok\u00e9mon needs.\n\nhttps://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/\u00a0\n\nBut if you can download PokeGenie. It can help you with some raid counters.\u00a0\n\nYou can also use PokeGenie to host and be invited to raids. Pok\u00e9mon Go Friends subreddit can also be helpful with hosting and being invited to raids. I never really needed it but I think there are videos on YouTube to host Pokemon Go raids. Best to try to host raids if you need the harder raid bosses but it neither sites would help for shadow or elite raids. Hosting is a bit harder than being invited to a raid but if you don\u2019t have remote passes, it would be beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is a lot but hopefully helpful.\n\nEdited to make things more clear hopefully.",
            "Great League has a cap of 1500 CP. So, you can power up different Azumarill to different levels and get more or less overall stats.\n\nA 15/15/15 Azumarill maxes out at level 36. You only get 83% of the max stats possible. \n\nA 0/15/15 Azumarill maxes out at level 45.5 and you get the full maximum of stats.\n\nAn analogy I like to use is imagine going shopping for groceries on a budget. If you have $50 to spend on food this week, one method is to buy equal amounts of each of grains, vegetables, and meat. (This is the 15/15/15) But, meat is more expensive, so you may end up getting less food total than if you buy more rice and vegetables and slightly less meat.",
            "You should restart your device once a week it helps keep it run smoothly",
            "For PvPoke different leagues have different rankings, so going for things in the first 50 ranks can give good results, but sometimes the Pokemon that can complement better your team could be in the 100s or below.\n\n\nThere's a team building tool in thee that can appraise any 3 Pokemon team, and suggest alternative members that can round them better.\n\n\nThe priority would be Species > Moves > Team composition > Bulk > IVs for there, so just keep an eye on anything with good PvP stats or rank and see if they work together.\n\n\nYou can transfer things you don't need, but there's a few things that's good to keep extras.\n\n\nAny spare legendary with bad stats, shiny, very high level Pokemon or costumes or copies of Pokemon that need a ton of XL candy can be good trade material. You get candy and XL candy by trading, so that can help power up the things you keep.\n\n\nAnd any high level Pokemon can be also used as a temporary raid member. IVs are only a small percentage of the total damage, so if you get a level 30+ wild Salamence or Dragonite you can still use it and it will save a lot of candy and dust.\n\n\nIf it really has no use and no good stats transferring to make room is ok.",
            "Hmm, these might be dumb questions:\n\nHow would I know what Pok\u00e9mon need a lot of XL candies? (I might not have reached that point yet)\n\nAs for costumes, those are those seasonal ones like the Slakoth with the hat, right? Not really useful to have outside of a collection, right?\n\nAnd as for high level ones, just those that have high CP, right? \n\nLast question, I have stuff that has high IVs, but low CP/level, and they\u2019re not really notable in any of the leagues or raids from what I\u2019m seeing. They worth trashing, or keeping just in case?",
            "All regular Pokemon need 296 XL candy to reach max level. Purified need 272 and Shadows need 360. You only need XL candy to power things past level 40 and you need to be level 31 yourself to unlock that option.\n\n\nMost Pokemon don't need to go that far to be useful, do only the best raid options or some PvP Pokemon need to level up that much to get to the right CP.\n\n\nOnly the top Pokemon of this list would be worth taking to 40+ if you want to maximize their damage on raids.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1bspkt9/best_raid_counters_per_type_anti_type_april_2024/\n\n\nAnd for PvP you'd need to check in PvPoke or Pokegenie the level needed on each league. Something good like Azumarill or Bastiodon will need XL, but most other things don't.\n\n\nCostumes are out collectibles. With very rare exceptions they're not better than the common version, so not need to keep them if you don't want to bother collecting them.\n\n\nThey are pretty rarer than the normal ones, specially if they're shiny or a limited release version, so the more time passes the more valuable they become on trades.\u00a0\n\n\nYou could get much more useful in exchange for those rate ones from someone that missed their event.\n\n\nThe level controls the CP, so the higher the level the more the CP will be, but high CP is not necessarily high level.\n\n\nA Caterpie could have less than 500 CP and it would be considered very high level, while a slaking could have over 2000 CP and would be lower level.\n\n\nThe white arch on top of every Pokemon shows the approximate level of any Pokemon, but you can figure out the exact level based on power ups.\n\n\n2 power ups is one level, and the max you can power things is your own level +10. So you can go to the power up screen, count how many power ups you'd need to reach the max and divide that by two.\n\n\nThen you take your level, add 10 then remove the number you got before, and that's the exact level of your Pokemon.\n\n\nFor the final question, if a Pokemon is not good having good IVs will lot make it much better. A high IV Wurmple will be weak anyway so you can transfer it to make room.\n\n\nJust make sure it's not a one-time encounter, like a Mythical or a final reward from a research, because they're often needed to finish that task, or are simply too rare to just transfer away.",
            "Oh, so if it says XL on PvPoke for the Pokemon, is that one worth keeping for trades, like you said before? Or do you mean something else?"
