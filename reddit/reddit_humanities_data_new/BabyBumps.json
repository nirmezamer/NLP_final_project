        "content": "TW WARNING: mention of blood loss.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, I was taking care of my one month old daughter and anticipating a wonderful night out with my 4.5 year old, when my period post-partum returned (I thought). I got a shower and noticed that my flow was faster than normal, and I had some cramping/clotting. \n\nI called my husband (Ryan) to tell him to pick up some extra pads, as I had soaked through two adult diapers in a matter of minutes. \n\nThinking it would slow down and not be a big deal, I tried to carry on. It only got worse in the following minutes - I called Ryan to come home, my family to come get the baby, and my favourite nurse for advice.\n\nAs mothers do, I took care of my daughter to ensure she was in safe place while waiting for help to come. Unfortunately, my house did look like a crime scene with an unmanageable amount of blood lost. \n\nI was taken by ambulance to the local hospital for what we now know was a post-partum hemorrhage, four weeks (33 days) after delivering my daughter. \n\nI had surgery in the wee hours of Friday morning and am home resting. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful for the medical teams from paramedics to nurses to doctors who took something that could have been fatal, and in a 6-minute surgery (while I had a great snooze) sent me back home to my kids. \n\nI am sharing because it didn\u2019t occur to me that I could hemorrhage 4 weeks after birth - I thought we were in the clear. I went from feeling perfectly fine to perfectly not-fine within minutes. \n\nI few things to look out for (I\u2019m sorry for the graphic details):\n- a consistent loss of blood that fills up a pad or diaper in under an hour (for me, it was like a faucet had been turned on).\n- Clots (I had a few clots at home that would have been comparable to a tennis ball), but anything bigger than a golf ball is reason to be concerned \n- Your own gut instinct. Or in this case, a friend who tells you to go to the hospital. \n-  can happen up to 12 weeks pp\n\nAs women, we are very quick to downplay our bodies and what they are doing. Our bodies are INSANE and the amount of things that go right in them day-to-day is matched with how many things can go wrong. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful and want to ensure other women know the signs as they possibly endure this as well.

The plan was that if we weren\u2019t pregnant by August 2020, we would take a road trip through several states and sight see, explore, etc. Well, we got pregnant March 2020 and found out the same week that Covid lockdown was announced\u2026so there went any traveling for the year \ud83d\ude02",
            "If your budget allows, I\u2019d recommend one last big vacation before you start trying. My wife and I meticulously planned the birth of our little one, and luckily everything aligned and she got pregnant the first or second try. We prepped the whole year before she got pregnant and planned a big vacation to the Outer Banks with our three dogs. It was a fantastic time. We had such an amazing week, went on many adventures and ate so many great meals. We even got to experience our first almost hurricane (the TS was only 5mph before hurricane threshold!). \n\nAnd to top it all off, the morning of check out, we had an extra pregnancy test I had spilled ice cream on. I didn\u2019t want to pack it so I told her to take it just in case (she had taken one two days prior and it was negative). But this pregnancy test came back positive! And our little one was born one month ago! \n\nI\u2019d also recommend getting good cookware and getting used to using it. This will allow you both to make bulk meals in one go, which saves a ton of time. \n\nHonestly, other than the first trimester, the pregnancy wasn\u2019t particularly restrictive and we did a lot of normal activities (well I guess except for during the placenta previa diagnosis but that cleared). Also having a baby is way less restrictive than we thought too. We are hiking and going to the zoo rather frequently.",
            "Get in the habit of a reasonable, consistent workout routine. One that you could maintain throughout pregnancy.

I still go on walks and whatnot, but an easy weights regiment would\u2019ve been good!",
            "Contrary to a lot of these, you can still travel and have fun and date etc after you give birth! Our lives became so much better in every way.\n\nIn the US, but my honest answer would be to leave a state that is anti-abortion. Because if every fiber of your being is hoping your baby gets carried to term, your prenatal care is likely to be poor and you\u2019ll be left to literally die in an emergency. Good OBs have left and also left shortages in places where they have to break state or federal law (and their own medical code of ethics), with the questionable ones staying (some good ones remain, but there\u2019s that shortage).\n\nFor our second, we moved, and despite not planning to start trying for a while, we already have meetings set up with midwives. We\u2019ll be doing \u201cpreconception counseling\u201d and developing a relationship we can feel secure in WELL ahead of time, this time.\n\nThe other things is to line up a marriage therapist. Have a few sessions to get comfortable, so that when you have spats and trouble understanding each other in a sleep deprived haze where your well meaning partner succumbs to internalized sexist mores or bad role modeling from parents/society or even just innate biological challenges (ie partner can do his sport; you have 6 months of recovery; equal parenting while exclusively nursing; lack of leave; one parent has a mental health challenge and can\u2019t be equal; one handles lack of sleep better\u2026), you can work productively through them rather than winding up as one of the many posts of miserable women who hate motherhood because their husbands aren\u2019t partners or fathers. Letting resentment build while killing yourself isn\u2019t okay.\n\nWrist prehab is also great. Any nagging \u201cmight be injured\u201d kind of things are going to be exacerbated, and it\u2019s hard to do PT effectively while gaining weight, moving your center of balance, and changing hormonally.\n\nOh, and make sure your teeth are in good shape and your dentist won\u2019t refuse to work on a pregnant woman!",

Finding new inside exercises was more difficult while pregnant than already having a routine. \n\nI wish I got the house ready for baby before I fell pregnant. Everyone told me not to do anything before pregnancy because \"you never know if you're actually going to fall pregnant\". Well, I fell pregnant the first month, and I had a really tough pregnancy so far.

You never know how pregnancy is going to be for you, and having a strong body is never a disadvantage. It will probably help with a lot of the aches and pains of pregnancy. It helps lower the risk of several of the complications of pregnancy (like gestational diabetes), it helps ypu have an easier and less complicated birth. And for the long days and night you have to carry your baby to make it sleep or to comfort it, it makes those less hard. My back and shoulders have been feeling it, at least. There is even being done studies on the benefit of exercise on breastfeeding/breastmilk (the study is not published yet). \n\nI ended up getting really bad pelvic girdle pain in early pregnancy. I was in a wheelchair by week 13, and I got gestational diabetes later in pregnancy. Due to the pelvic girdle pain, I obviously wasn't able to keep up with my active life, and I quickly found out I needed more arm strength than what I had from before. If you are already exercising (that includes weight lifting and strength exercises), you can safely keep doing it durin pregnancy.

I was traveling full-time pre-Covid (and before getting pregnant, obviously), so being able to show her the world and share it with her is something I really can\u2019t wait to do.

I have a cautionary tale about that...\n\nI did this, I lost weight, I was running 5k 6x/week and lifting 4x per week. This is only slightly more than I typically did. Then, I got pregnant with a rare pregnancy complication, required emergency surgery, had significant post operative issues, emotional challenges associated with loss and knowing subsequent pregnancies would always be higher risk. I then had another loss after. Safe to say, I gained that weight back and was set back physically beyond what I had done to \"prepare\". It was entirely out of my control. Life happened to me. I felt extra stress, guilt and pressure on top of managing loss and fear of not getting the family I wanted, and sadness that I wasn't as \"healthy\" or \"fit\" as I'd imagined I'd be going into pregnancy. I grieved the loss of a chance at an uncomplicated pregnancy but also the loss of the idea I'd have a fitter healthier pregnancy I wanted. I had done the work, it just didn't go that way. I'm beyond grateful for pregnancy and a chance to grow my own family now.  I think there is absolutely merit in getting healthier and being in a state that makes you feel good going into pregnancy, but the mindset around that should be approached with caution. I weighed more during pregnancy than I wanted, I walked and stretched instead of ran and lifted, I bought a bigger size and thanked my body for giving me a chance at a baby even if it wasn't how I'd imagined. So, be healthy but don't set expectations on it.\n\nAlso, to the question you actually asked - I love materntiy underwear.

And by the time I\u2019m able to go out again socially, they may be getting pregnant and settling down more) 2) travel just you and your husband, or with friends if that\u2019s a thing for you. We went on some dream vacations before getting pregnant and that was more doable without the added financials of a baby, though we don\u2019t plan to stop traveling once he\u2019s born. 3) get your health in check to the best of your ability. Go to the dentist, get your bloodwork done, get into good eating and fitness patterns. The first trimester may leads to (and this happened to me, despite being so certain I\u2019d work out through it all) months off from physical activity, even if you were fit before, due to nausea, vomitting, food aversions. While I\u2019m back to it in the second trimester and was in overall good shape before the pregnancy, I wish I fine tuned this a little more and got into the best shape I could have. The travel and partying with friends mentioned above didn\u2019t exactly help lol so it\u2019s a balancing act and overall as a person, i tend to be in good shape, but in terms of my personal baseline, I feel like I was in average shape than I normally am when i became pregnant and the first few months were full of bed-lock and carbs 4) do any home projects that you may not want to do pregnant. We painted and did some projects with our home/garage gym like hanging some tvs and adding storage solutions and things in there when I was about 5 weeks pregnant, before the 1st trimester symptoms hit me hard and if we had waited a week or two I probably wouldn\u2019t have had it in me, even now when I feel the best I have during pregnancy right now (toward the end of second trimester).

            "Oh, I cannot empathize enough how much the anti abortion state thing matters. If you can move, do. You can personally be anti abortion, but you don't know where your journey is leading, and you need good care. I've had some scary pregnancy complications in the last year with zero risk factors. I had an ectopic and then a preemie due to severe preeclampsia. All of this after a successful, healthy, full term pregnancy with my first, who is 4.5 years old.\n\nI woke up every morning for two weeks thinking that was the day I would get a chemo shot to resolve my pregnancy. At that moment, there was someone in congress talking about trying to surgically reimplant ectopic pregnancies. My wife was writing an academic paper about abortion travel bans and I wouldn't let her talk about it to me. It was horrifying. \n\nEven when everything goes perfectly, pregnancy is not health neutral. It takes a tremendous amount out of you. You deserve the best care you can get, and if, god forbid, something isn't going well, you need providers who are able to take care of you.\n\nHaving young kids can be really rough on a marriage, so a counselor is very solid advice. Setting up with an individual therapist is a good idea, too. I was thankful to be established with my therapist when I was dealing with my ectopic and some crises that popped up when I was pregnant with my second baby.\n\nStart taking prenatal vitamins several months before you start trying, or at least when you stop preventing, if that's an option for you.",

            "The phrase \"Implantation\" Bleeding is popular on conception forums but is a bit of a misnomer that causes some people to think that the bleeding is due to the embryo implanting. It isn't -- the embryo is only about 0.2mm in diameter at that point, and won't displace significant blood (or cause pain) when it implants. You bleed when progesterone levels in your body drop, which is why you can induce a period by stopping birth control pills (which contain progesterone) or by taking and then stopping progesterone suppositories or Provera (which are also progesterone). Progesterone levels dropping in the luteal phase can be caused by a) increased estrogen in the mid-luteal-phase estrogen surge, which briefly depresses estrogen production, or b) a decrease in progesterone when the corpus luteum runs out of gas at the end of the luteal phase. If b), and you're actually pregnant, your levels can drop briefly before the embryo starts producing enough HCG to tell the corpus luteum to ramp the levels up. Either way, luteal phase spotting can either be a neutral sign (in the case of mid-luteal phase spotting) or a negative sign (in the case of late luteal phase progesterone dropping), but it doesn't have anything to do with implantation, and is not a positive sign of being pregnant.

I DESPERATELY wanted to keep my baby but it was dead inside me .. my state would have made me keep its dead body inside of me rotting away. It\u2019s obviously extremely triggering for me still. And having to go through that while also being villainized for a medically necessary procedure was so horrible. Thankfully I was able to pass everything naturally.

So hot deli sandwiches are fine. I\u2019ve been a bit turned off by the idea so haven\u2019t done it, lol.

            "Hmm I\u2019m not sure the recommendations are related to straining the digestive system. Rather, they\u2019re related to the risk of listeria and salmonella. Some countries consider raw fish a risk for one or both diseases, others do not.",
            "What I meant, is that is could be a similar phenomenon to *Traveler's diarrhea*.\n\nA tourist goes to a different country, eats the same things as locals, drinks the same water as them. The locals are fine, but the tourist gets a diarrhea.\n\nSo why does this happen? The reason is exposure to bacteria, viruses, or parasites that are unfamiliar to one's digestive system. Locals often develop some degree of immunity or tolerance to pathogens prevalent in their environment, which visitors do not have.",
            "I understand your point here, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually the case with pregnancy recommendations. Listeria and salmonella are not diseases that, Japanese people for example, have any special exposure-based immunity to. They simply consider their standards for fish processing to be high enough that raw fish doesn\u2019t present a significant risk for these two specific diseases. Fish is also a more significant part of the general diet, so avoiding it represents a greater (real or perceived) nutritional loss. \n\nWhen you\u2019re talking about raw ingredients, such as raw egg or raw fish, the associated risk is specifically salmonella. During pregnancy, there is a very small risk of salmonella crossing the placenta and harming the fetus. For some of us (including me personally), the very small risk of contracting salmonella from raw foods combined with the very small risk of salmonella harming the fetus does not represent a great enough risk to avoid those foods throughout the pregnancy. If, however, you have salmonella while you\u2019re giving birth, the baby is at a significant risk of exposure. Being sick and giving birth also would be awful. So there\u2019s more reason to avoid salmonella risks toward the end of your pregnancy or even the whole third trimester. \n\nWhen you\u2019re talking about refrigerated foods, such as deli meats, prepared salads, or cut fruit, the associated risk is listeria. Listeria is very, very serious if you contract it while pregnant. However, listeria outbreaks can occur in any food. They\u2019ve occurred in chocolate, cantaloupe, sliced turkey, cheeses, stone fruits, ice cream, frozen vegetables, and other things. There are categories of food that have had more listeria outbreaks in the past, including deli meats, and are therefore on the \u201cavoid\u201d list for pregnancy. But some of us might prefer to eat all of those foods normally and just stay very aware of listeria outbreaks in our specific country. \n\nSorry for doubling down and being so extensive about this. I just feel strongly that we should be empowered with an accurate understanding of the pregnancy recommendations so that we can make our own decisions!",
            "I actually agree with you and you made some great points:\u00a0\n\n>\\[Japanese people\\] simply consider their standards for fish processing to be high enough that raw fish doesn\u2019t present a significant risk for these two specific diseases.\n\nand\n\n>But some of us might prefer to eat all of those foods normally and just stay very aware of listeria outbreaks in our specific country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFood processing standards and issues vary from country to country and that's why it's preferable to take advice from local experts and local doctors.\n\nSome people are willing to do extensive research on every food item they consume. Kudos to them! But sadly not everyone has time and energy for that."
