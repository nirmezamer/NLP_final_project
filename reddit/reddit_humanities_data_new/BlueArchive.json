            "I do not own any characters from Ninjutsu Research Club, and I have no access to Volume 5. Is there any way for me to complete \"Win 2 battles with Ninjutsu Club students\" quest grom the Guide Task? Its the only one remaining that I can try to do without being able to start Volume 5.",
            "So, I've been trying to follow a few tutorials and comps for this quest, and after changing some stuff, I thought I had achieved a good team, but I still can't do it...\n\nMy best run was the one where the boss had 6 HP bars at the end to the battle. So I'm showing you guys all the details of my team, and I hope I can have some advice! thank you all in advance <3\n\nObs: tsubaki and yuuka are my tanks, I have Shun for boss damage, so Chise and Akane can kill those nuns. Fuuka can heal my entire team. I made this team based on\u00a0[Minami Kotori's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV49kZuj2bg). I already tried the famous comp of Tsubaki, Yuuka, Serika, Asuna, Serina and Hanae, but it didn't fit well for me at all.\n\n**Strikers:**\n\n**Tsubaki**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 2 / 3  \nArtifacts: T2 / T4 / T1\n\n**Shun (Small)**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 1 / 2 / 2 / 1  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T3\n\n**Chise**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 1 / 1 / 1  \nArtifacts: T2 / T1 / T1\n\n**Yuuka**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 2 / 2  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T1\n\n**Specials:**\n\n**Fuuka \u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 3 / 3 / 3 / 3  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T3\n\n**Akane (Bunny) \u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 1 / 1 / 1  \nArtifacts: T1 / T1 / T1\n\nAlso, I don't mind giving a full list of my student list, or listing the most upgraded ones. I really want to clear this fight so I can complete my missions that will expire in 2 days :')",
            "Is it worth it to invest in a UE40 C. Hare to get her passive skill+ that increases buff duration? I know that this is useful for Himari, but C. Hare's skill seems already long enough.",
            "Do attack buffs stack? Like I just Himari and been thinking of using her attack buffs with Kotama's (I'm referring to their EX skills specifically)",
            "In lore, is Tomoe just, uh, a big fan of Cherino, as in that's her whole character? I got to her memory scene and yeah, it's a bit contrived, but I was kinda expecting her to have a bit more personality, instead of just being purely a Cherino fan girl?",
            "Anyone in Asia server have Izuna or Tsukuyo that I can borrow for the Hyakkiyako Lantern Festival event mission that's ending soon? I'm still rather new to the game and haven't unlocked Volume 5 yet. Currently stuck at 99 Chicken Skewers and need to win 2 battles using Ninjutsu Research Club students to get enough for the 10-pull ticket but I don't have any of them. My friend code is AYUNEBME. Hope you guys can help.",
            "Lv. 63, 63K pyroxenes.\n\n* Red dealers are **Serika, Hina, Mutsuki,** and Akari.  \n* Yellow are **Momoi, Nonomi, Iori,** Junko, Neru, Mikoto, Pina, and Maki.  \n* Blue are **Chise**, Aris, Haruna, and Asuna.  \n* Purple is **Momiji**.  \n* Tanks are **Yuuka, Tsubaki, Mine,** and Hoshino.\n* Notable supports are **Ui, Kokona, Cherino, Himari**, and **S. Shiroko**.\n\nBolded are the units I'm currently finding useful. Is it worth pulling for C. Hare given this roster, or do I save for later banners?\n\ne: I'm also hitting the enhancement stone/credit bottlenecks (11M left after using all my permits) now that I'm trying to gear up to T7 and max out EX skills. Are there proper/improper strats for earning and managing these resources from here on?",
            "Serious question, how strong is D.Hina? Everyone is saying she is a must pull, so save for her. Is she like Mika but for Light armor?",
            "I've been playing for almost 3 months now and managed to do most permanent content in the game after hitting level 70. For now I'm trying to plan my pulls a bit more in the long term trying to get supports and limiteds in this first year of playing and focusing on my favorites later.\n\nRight now I got 68k pyro and the first and most obvious choice is saving 400 pulls for D.Hina and S.Hoshino. The banners has double hate, can get other Fes limited spooks on top of regular spooks, and getting potential D.Hina dupes sounds really good regardless if I get both banner characters early. So as a new payer spending 400 here regardless is a really good plan, correct?\n\nNow after this is where I'm not sure. Focusing more on limited characters for this first year I can guarantee another 2 characters before stopping to save for the next Fes. Looking at the upcoming schedule between: NY.Mutsuki/NY.Aru, or NY.Fuuka/NY.Haruna, or Nagisa/Toki, or B.Kazusa/B.Yoshimi, which ones are the best options for a new player? NY.Fuuka seems like a no-brainer, but between the others I'm not sure which one would be a better generic pick.",
            "I just want to know if I'm on the right or wrong path if I'm level 34 on day 11 since I started playing.",
            "So, I'm a new player doing the decagrammaton event. In prologue, Sensei already knew about the AI. \n\nWhen did we meet/learn about it? was it in another event?",
            "I've noticed that there are a ton of great characters getting banners in the near future, so as a new player, what should I prioritize getting from the next 2 or so months of banners? I managed to get Himari and I'm currently sitting on 50k or so pyroxenes. Other notable (?) 3\\*s that I have are Cherino, Shun, Kokona, Ui, Kikyou, Azusa and HS Shigure.",
            "What supports should I use for wakamo?\nAnd should I buff her with himari before using her ex or after because it takes time to activate",
            "I'm doing the main story and wondering if its worth getting conquest 100% on all of the outskirts district zones in the Ark of Atrahasis? do you get any extra rewards?",
            "Is there a tierlist somewhere about the best students to use for each joint firing drill mode?",
            "Hello, I would like to ask if AI singing content allowed to post in this subreddit?",
            "[Justin's Planner works pretty well.](https://justin163.com/planner/)",
            "Clearing Goz with a borrowed S Izuna would be one way to do this",
            "You don't need to worry about the missions expiring; they'll come back in a few months with your progress saved.\n\nI think the team from that video requires Hibiki.  If you don't have her, you'll need to do something else.  Since you have Tsubaki and Chise, maybe look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf6D9v4traM .",
            "Players usually UE her to increase her survivability rather than the buff duration because as you said it's already long enough.",
            "In that specific instance, no. Both are ATK buffs on the EX slot applied directly to a target. The 2nd one applied will always overwrite the 1st.\n\nThere are instances where they will stack, like if they're on different skill slots or are auras, etc. Example: S.Hoshino's EX will stack with Himari's EX since S.Hoshino's is an aura around her while Himari's is applied directly to a target. Anotehr example would be Himari's EX stacking with Natsu's Normal since they're on different skill slots.\n\nSame can be applied to debuffs. An example is like where EX applied Defense Downs will not stack, but an EX applied Defense Down will stack with ones from other skill sources. And they also follow the same rule of applying directly and indirectly can stack if on the same skill slot. Example being Maki's Defense Down on her Normal skill stacks with S.Hanako's Defense Down on her Normal skill since Maki's is applied directly to a target and S.Hanako's is applied to the ground of the target.",
            "Yea sadly. She's just a stuck up assistant for Cherino.",
            "You have Himari, so you should probably do fine without C.Hare. If you can get Ako, you should be set for most of the current Insane difficulty strategies. and you can grab C.Hare with the event rerun next year. That way you should have enough Pyrox to guarantee getting both Dress Hina and Swimsuit Hoshino in the Fes. Hopefully you can also spook some of the other Fes characters.\n\nAlso, commenting on your other characters, Haruna is actually extremely good, you should consider building her for Blue content if you are having trouble with it. Maki will also be very useful later on, but you should be set for regular content with your preferred Yellow units.",
            "> C. Hare\n\nYou have enough gems. I recommend pull for C.Hare and then save your gems and go all out on the D.Hina fest banner, you also gonna get free 100 pulls for D.Ako banner",
            "C.Hare shines in late game drafts where your dps are already built and just need buffs, at your lvl you won't get much use out of her and she'll be way too squishy like Ui so **save**.\n\nIt's mid game from lvl 60 onwards and you need to be really careful whom you max or lvl up. Just keep your main hypercarry leveled and rest with as low investment as possible. If your units are surviving and doing decent damage then upgrading their skills or gears is not advisable.",
            "IDK if you'll make it however If you can get one more spark I'd spend it on NY.Kayoko instead. Blue just tends to be slightly down on DPS overall compared to red and yellow so NY.Kayoko is almost essential. I don't have S.Hoshino and have managed for most red content and I seldom use my S.Ui for yellow.\n\nFor the time being I'd also farm Haruna. I know she's a \"common\" but she does have pretty decent DPS once maxed out. Same for Maki, she can surprise you with her auto attack chip damage and her DEF debuff is pretty much mandatory for Binah.",
            "Yes, she is that broken. Since she ignores Damage Stability(damage ranges), all you need to do is Crit mald with her. And her numbers are stupidly high that she just melts anything Light Armor.",
            "She looks to be as busted as Mika is to yellow however I don't think she will be able flex to yellow as well as Mika can flex to blue. Two of her modifiers are red self buffs however they won't be applied during yellow content vs Mika's single yellow effectiveness buff that is missed for blue. I've also been told that for certain content and AOE based damage Aru/Mutsuki may still be slightly better if you crit mald however D.Hina is overall more comfy.",
            "> So as a new payer spending 400 here regardless is a really good plan, correct?\n\nI would recommend saving 400 for it, but stopping at 200 if you get at least one of them early. Hoping for good spooks is too risky to spend an entire spark on it. You could use that spark to guarantee an important unit, including a limited one that you have no chance of getting on the anniversary banners. Elephs are nice, but pulling just for elephs is more whale territory than F2P budget territory. You wouldn't brick your account or anything by going for 400, but with so many good banners coming I wouldn't do it, particularly as a new player still missing many important units.\n\n> Looking at the upcoming schedule between: NY.Mutsuki/NY.Aru, or NY.Fuuka/NY.Haruna, or Nagisa/Toki, or B.Kazusa/B.Yoshimi, which ones are the best options for a new player?\n\nNutsuki is good and still sees a lot of use for high level blue AoE content. Nyaru not so much, and her role in Chesed has been taken over by Makoto. If you don't have Nykayoko it could be a pretty good idea to go for her and Nutsuki. Nyfuuka is a must have, basically on the same level as Himari and Ako and unlocks many new team compositions. Nyharuna is mostly for PvP at this point. Nagisa isn't a must have, but she's meta in PvP and generally good to have. Toki doesn't have much role right now, and with Dhina to compete with her I don't think she will have one unless something changes. Even if they have opposing urban moods, I don't think most people will be willing to build Toki for a potential niche use when they have Dhina that will probably be viable for that same role. The band girls seem to be only for Set, for now. From what I've seen they ended up not being used much for torment red Wakaboat.\n\nKeep in mind that a limited unit isn't necessarily more valuable than a really good permanent one, unless you're a collector.",
            "Levels are related to the amount of stamina you spend so if you are spending all your stamina you are good. One thing though is that you should be trying to push through main story even if you can't 3 star them just to level up your cafe for more stamina.",
            "You are using 3x AP refreshes I assume with that growth rate. It's fine to do until lvl 50-60 but after that the exp required to level up becomes a bit more so Pyro to AP output isn't that great since you could be spending that Pyro for getting new characters. \n\nSince you are new I wouldn't really mind much the refreshes but do keep that in the 3x limit only. After that it becomes expensive.",
            "If you're a new player, do NOT pull for Camp Hare. She is good, but she's good for late game and people with plenty of invested units to take advantage of her. So even if you see a lot of folks saying she's a must, I'd skip her if I were you.\n\nI'd say the must pull banners are NY!Kayoko and the festival banner. Kayoko will help you a lot in blue content, both in the short and long term. The festival banner has on one hand, extremely strong (or outright broken) students that can only be recruited twice a year, and on the other hand, it has higher rates for the regular 3* pool, so you can get high tier units.\n\n*Edit. \nThe above is a recommendation if you care about meta/good units. If you don't care and want to pull for cute girls, go nuts on whoever you like most",
            "I just read her ex skill and it seems kinda complicated. Am I supposed to use a nuke after her ex skill to maximize her damage?",
            "Before. The damage cap of the explosion is based on her atk stat at the time she uses her ex. You need some damage in between her ex and the explosion, but her own normal skill is usually enough to fill it if you have her t2 bond gear.",
            "Capturing useless tiles not near enemies isn't worth it but defeating all enemies sure is because 5 AP for 10-15 pyros isn't terrible.",
            "No. While there are often some characters who consistently perform well because they are just generally good (like Kokona in the scarecrow healing JFD), the mode is all about gimmicks that change with each season, so tier-list would be pretty much impossible. There are best picks for each different JFD, though.\n\nEach mode also cycles between different defense types. So even though Momoi and Midori were very good picks for the previous Breakthrough Drill due to it featuring enemies with Heavy (yellow) armor, the next one will feature Elastic (purple) armor, and gimmick that Sniper Rifle users have increased attack.",
            "Thank you",
            "oh, that hyakkiyako festival event comes back? I was worried bc I have 99 tokens, and the only missions left are those to complete the story (chapter 5) and to win battles with ninjutsu club students, but I don't have any of them...\n\nbtw yes I don't have hibiki, but I'll try to look to this comp, tysm!! \\^-\\^",
            "I LITERALLY DID IT BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO THANK YOU SO SO MUCH ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)",
            "Ok thanks.",
            "Thanks man :)\nSince the math wasn't checking out I thought crits were messing up my data, can't even fathom how the community found out about these things.",
            "But Himari and Ako buff stack even though these are both Ex Slots skill applied directly to a target.",
            "Damn. I thought her memory scene was p sexy, but ughhhh. i was expecting, not Ako, per se, but something more, i suppose",
            ">You have enough gems\n\nI'd rather recommend using that on the NYFuuka banner after the D.Hina banner. Also 2 spark is enough for the fes banner, after that it's over spending.",
            "Thanks, i have build all the mostly required students for most of the raids for heavy and special armors. I lack most of the red students like Aru, i think i will skip them and save resources for D.Hina.",
            "I heard there is much powercreep in blue archive and they always released new unit which is better than previous,is that true?",
            "I see, NY.Fuuka and NY PS68 would be better picks. I'll go with that for now on the planner. \n\nFor the Fes it would be more pulling for potential spooks than Eligma/Elephs, 6% is damn good and I have some good memories of making similar bad decisions in GBF being fine and not being punished by it but I truly don't know how good/bad this is in this game lol. Mostly because I'm also not opposed to vertical investment too.\n\n>but with so many good banners coming I wouldn't do it, particularly as a new player still missing many important units.\n\nFrom those the only ones that catch my eye are Sakurako/Ui/Hinata, but we got Ui and Hinata recently, what are the odds of them coming back so soon? I already got Iwak and Ako so those seem like skips.",
            "Yes that's what I'm trying.\nAlthough really the lack of materials such as Blu ray is killing me.\nAnd as I said in the previous comment, my biggest fear is not being well enough for the upcoming anniversary.\nFurthermore, a friend (who introduced me to the game) told me that unfortunately most of the rerun events that will come will only have history and not many events to obtain materials or pyro.",
            "In fact I haven't used refresh.\nI only use the AP of my level, my cafe that is level 3 and has the max comfort and daily AP of club.\nBut my question was because I feel that I am very underlevel since I am at mission 7 or 8 normal\u00a0 and It is very difficult for me to reach time (Several times only for 3 seconds remaining) and in addition to not being able to not have a good double team (in other words I only get one star).\nMy biggest worry is not being prepared enough for the upcoming anniversary.\n(Google translate srry)",
            "With her Bond 20 item, she usually has enough DPS from autoattacks and Basic Skill to proc max accumulation damage on her own. \n\nBut in general, yes, she acts as pseudo-support, where you pump as much damage into the target as you can after using her EX.",
            "You can mess around in https://schale.gg/ by inputting buffs onto a character page in the Details section if you wanna see which ones stack or not.",
            "Himari applies ATK, Ako applies Crit Chance and Crit Damage.",
            "Yea that's the thing with red winter students. They all have way too much of a \"comrade\" vibes except maybe Meru I think cuz she's a stalker lol.",
            "The powercreep is not that noticeable, it's just the Fes/Anniversary units that are deliberately overpowered.\n\nMost of the other recent units are nothing special.",
            "It's up to you if you want to gamble or not. I prefer to play it safe when I don't have a surplus, but it's not my account. [Here](https://litter.catbox.moe/q4j4g4.png)'s an example I threw together of what your pulling plans might end up looking like. Now, to be fair, you'd almost certainly have enough if you factor in surprise gifts and various other bonuses or milestones. Pyroxene extra income doesn't dry up completely just because you approach or reach max level, and odds are that you'll get what you want early from at least one banner.\n\nAs for good banners:\n\nChare is a striker Himari. Dako is a striker AoE Ako. Daru is a striker Ako. Nyakari is sort of an AoE Nykayoko. Dako and Nyakari are mainly for Set so far. None of these are vital for new or intermediate players, particularly if you already have Himari and Ako, but they're good units.\n\nNykayoko and Nyfuuka are meta buffers and enablers. Dhina and Shoshino need no introduction. You're already getting them, but I'm mentioning them for the sake of it.\n\nThen there are various slightly more niche units that are really good to have, like Nutsuki (AoE, hopefully cheap if you're pulling for Nykayoko), Atsuko (core for Kurokage, useful in most things, including Set), Iroha (Perorodzilla, \"AoE\", PvP), Mine (tank with lots of utility and debuffs) and Nagisa (AoE, support, PvP). You wouldn't pull for most of these if you're still building the must haves, but they're worth considering. Ui, Ako, Kokona and Shun probably won't get global runs so soon, since they were inserted randomly into banners on JP and global at roughly the same time. There are a lot of good units coming, but if you're only pulling for absolute must haves, you shouldn't have any trouble.",
            ">Yes that's what I'm trying. Although really the lack of materials such as Blu ray is killing me\n\nNo idea why you are obsessed with blurays early on. I cleared all the story at the time with only Aru and Neru as my 3 stars, and everyone having lv1 skills. \n\nYou just need to mainly focus on equipment as in try to keep your team with the highest obtainable gear you can get and the current X2 drop on normal will help you achieve that faster.\n\n>told me that unfortunately most of the rerun events that will come will only have history and not many events to obtain materials or pyro\n\nThe reruns they are talking about are not really reruns and more like immortalized events since those have already rerun a bunch of times. Good thing though is that they will still allow you to get the event unit if they have one but you can't farm them.\n\nDue note that not all rerunning events get that treatment just ones that have rerun a bunch.",

I spent a total of four hours but being forced to get whatever score I could obtain when time remaining is less than 9 minutes. Fvck this sheet. I'll just sweep until the end.",
            "[This Gooz is cooked](https://litter.catbox.moe/k6j1n3.png). And coincidentally it pushed my pyroxene counter over [100k](https://litter.catbox.moe/bbfs9n.png) for the first time, I believe. It's been over that in the past if counting tickets, though.\n\nEvery time a raid comes around, someone will say that it's the worst raid in the game. With Goz, however, that's actually true; the core mechanics of this raid are mechanics that don't work properly in Blue Archive. The big one is that movement in BA just isn't precise enough. Now, you can recreate the same reposition scenarios by using pixel perfect and frame perfect inputs, sure. But even then there will be a random factor in the form of when enemies die, which affects how your units move on their own, which in turn affects how they will behave when you reposition them. And that extreme level of precision isn't a good fit for a phone game. To make matters worse, phase 2 has you repositioning to get to the right Goz, to stay inside the tricolor circle, to dodge the hat attacks, and in some cases simply to refresh shields. It's entirely possible that you will get a hat pattern that demands that you go to the other side of the map, which is a literal impossibility. And even if you dodge to the sides, it can cause issues if you have to do it just before the tricolor circles. The cherry on top is that the units that are practically required to handle mechanics are limited in one form or another, with no viable substitutes (I will not count Kotori). Though to be fair, Seimi is now a permanent unit that can fill that role, and as far as I can tell she should be better than Sshizuko if you only consider survivability. That extra range must make phase 1 much better when it comes to getting your team out of the trains' way.\n\nI could go on, but I wouldn't be saying anything new, nor have I really said anything new in the previous paragraph. Movement in BA needs a significant rework to make Goz a good boss. The other raids have smaller flaws that could be improved, such as the pointless evasion for Chesed. But Goz is the one boss whose mechanics contradict the other mechanics of the game.",

            "So this is super buggy.\n\nIf you use focus fire on the real Goz before he teleports he just eats your EX slot and nothing ever fills that slot. I had this happen earlier, like wtf?

Maybe his animation doesn't line up with the debuffs properly, but it seems to me like it actually goes faster than many students' EX animations.",
            "Dealing with your team hiding behind the skill cards reminded me of a few UI improvements I've been thinking that it would be nice to get. The first one is some sort of toggleable list over units that you can target with buffs and the like. Instead of trying to hit the right pixel when she's in a crowd or behind something, you could just click on her icon to make the skill target her. JP actually got something somewhat similar recently... in the cafe, [when you open the gifts list](https://litter.catbox.moe/xw5en9.png).\n\nThe other is a rework of the buffs and debuffs list, since it's pretty bad as it is now. First, remove all permanent buff or debuff icons, or at least add an option to do so. They're pointless and only serve to make the list harder to read. Second, make it easier to tell the duration of a buff or debuff, and what it does. One way to do this is to add a timer bar under each buff icon. It would be nice if you could pause the game and open a menu to check all buffs and debuffs on all targets, and see exact effects and durations. This would make it easier to tell if you need to reapply an effect soon, if you aren't the kind of \u00dcbermensch that effortlessly keeps track of exact duration and activation times. It'd also make it easier to keep track of debuffs for Gregorius, to make it a little less of a spreadsheet fight.",

            "I give up trying to one punch insane Goz  since Hinata refuse to crit. I hope red and yellow need less mald than blue ![img](emote|t5_2vhvtt|33220)",
            "So I was only able to clear insane on yellow. Red and Blue were extreme clears. There\u2019s a chance if I had solely focused on this raid and dumped all mats into it forgoing everything else I could have done Insane for all. But Wakaboat is coming and I know I\u2019m going to have difficulty clearing Insane and I\u2019d rather focus on TAs at this point in my account. \n\nBut all the malding and student choice restrictions got me thinking about ways the devs could improve Goz if they ever decided to change him to be more balanced\u2026 so here it is\n\nWhat needs to change: T Yuuka not being absolutely required\n\nThe range the trains in P1 take up/size of the stage needs to be changed so that Kotori/S Shizuko repositions can consistently be used without pixel perfect positioning and timing. Edit: or make it so the lightly shaded area means if you have a shield, the train doesn\u2019t move or damage you. But no shield means damage and movement. Would make someone like Kaede viable too\n\nIn P2, the size of stage/distance between Goz clones need to change so Kotori/S Shizuko can get the whole party only targeting the Goz of choice. Also would hopefully make TS units act more predictable.\n\nWhat could be changed. 1 or 2 of these in addition to the above ones would make it feel a bit more fair. Some of these might not be perfect, but thoughts I\u2019ve had.\n\nRemove the mobs from P1. With the need for repositioning, DPS, crit res shred, plus buffers you run out of slots for either crit res shred or AoE.\n\nLower Goz\u2019s crit resistance. I saw it\u2019s the same or similar amount to HOD, but it feels so much worse. Probably due to all the other RNG mechanics that can derail things in addition to missing crits.\n\nIn P2, make it so hitting the clone with AAs and basic skills deal 50% of the damage. EX\u2019s can\u2019t be included due to Hinata, but it will make those depending on BS casts for damage to feel less bad. Also would make TS units more reliable.\n\nReduce Goz\u2019s hitbox size. I know, I know, but just hear me out, then call me an idiot after lol. So Goz is mainly about repositioning your students. But Goz\u2019s hitbox is so large that it causes your students to move in unpredictable ways, which in a raid focused on repositioning, is kind of an issue. \n\nRemove the healing debuff. They can keep the shielding mechanic and damage reduction it brings, but it\u2019ll allow small amounts of healing, like Ako or S Hoshino to work so one bit of bad luck won\u2019t tank a run due to a lack of healing.\n\nI know combining a few of them would make Goz way too easy, but some of them would move Goz from infuriating to just hard. Goz just feels like a poorly designed boss where they just took a few small things one step too far. Where in their own they aren\u2019t egregious, but they add up.\n\nAnd what a lot of GAs kinda show is they need more students that cover niches with different armor types. Like more students that can reposition and shield, Crit Res Shred students that don\u2019t have red armor, or reposition strikers that don\u2019t have red armor\u2026 or Hypercarries that don\u2019t have red armor (I\u2019m noticing a trend here lol). Essentially I\u2019d hope the devs start to design students with more than just one raid in mind.\n\nAnyways, thanks for coming to my TED talk, you can all go about your day lol",

            ">even then there will be a random factor in the form of when enemies die, which affects how your units move on their own, which in turn affects how they will behave when you reposition them\n\nThe positioning and pathing logic can be really awful in this game. For example, in the current PvP map, I've found that a damager in the bottom slot will almost always run past the table, then backtrack to take cover behind it. But sometimes they sort of get lost, and more than once I've seen them stop for a moment, and go around the other side for a complete circle of the table before actually taking cover. That costs matches.\n\nAs far as the current raid, there's so much movement after T.Yuuka's reposition that even when I do it \"right\" and set the point well on the opposite side, there are still times when someone runs all the way back over. And for the double Screamrider, it's not uncommon to have *both* trains hit someone, because after the reposition they just spread back out more than the width of the safe spot. Her shields are actually enough that it's not generally a problem, but there's clearly a design issue when the \"correct\" strategy with a character basically built for this raid still can't actually avoid the trains.\n\n>It's entirely possible that you will get a hat pattern that demands that you go to the other side of the map\n\nThe hats are also annoying in that how much they matter depends heavily on which clone is real.

I tested it just now, though obviously the rest of my team is much more invested. Still, since almost all damage comes from the borrowed dealer, I think it should be possible for you too. Remember that Goz has really high crit resistance, so you have to reset for crits. Mika is broken and bypasses that entirely. For red, I believe Aru is a better choice than Mutsuki, since she has a higher damage ceiling and higher crit. But since she only deals two hits with her EX, you'll still have to reset until you get enough crits.\n\nAnother possible issue is that you aren't using optimal rotations, particularly if it's your first Goz. Are you using two Hinata EXes per Himako buff cycle? With Ui you can squeeze it in by using Hinata at 10 cost and the two buffers immediately after, then someone to cycle (sometimes Tyuuka), then Hinata again before the buffs wear off. Consider checking some videos of how people do insane just to see how the fight goes, if you haven't. [Example](https://youtu.be/-S1z2xXG_AA) of an imperfect insane clear. Try replacing Nykayoko with someone that allows for cheap cycling. I did the test with Tsubaki as the replacement, which isn't ideal.\n\n> Also, his groggy phase is ridiculously short.\n\nIt's 10 seconds, supposedly. For Goz, the groggy is relatively irrelevant, since it doesn't provide any particular damage increase the way it does for bosses like Kurokage or Perorodzilla.

            "My opinions:\n\n> The range the trains in P1 take up/size of the stage needs to be changed so that Kotori/S Shizuko repositions can consistently be used without pixel perfect positioning and timing.\n\nNot sure how you could do this without it having a domino effect. If you make the trains smaller, you would end up in a situation where you don't need repositioning if you can just get all your units into the middle lane safely. I do agree that something needs to be done so that repositioners that aren't named Tyuuka can reliably get your idiots out of the trains' way. Not that Tyuuka can do it completely reliably to begin with. Maybe make it so that a unit won't enter the marked area if you actively reposition her outside of it. Or just rework repositioning entirely.\n\n> or make it so the lightly shaded area means if you have a shield, the train doesn\u2019t move or damage you. But no shield means damage and movement\n\nI guess I would be ok with that, too.\n\n> In P2, the size of stage/distance between Goz clones need to change so Kotori/S Shizuko can get the whole party only targeting the Goz of choice. Also would hopefully make TS units act more predictable.\n\nThe shape of the arena is an issue that should be improved. The right Goz is much easier to reach and also safer, at least on insane. The left Goz is actually preferable on torment, but as you mentioned actually getting to him is too hard.\n\n> Remove the mobs from P1. With the need for repositioning, DPS, crit res shred, plus buffers you run out of slots for either crit res shred or AoE.\n\nI strongly disagree with this one. It would change the fight pretty significantly and alter the \"identity\" of the raid. Shield and reposition takes up one slot (ideally), main dealer takes up one slot, and buffers take up from one to four slots. A tank is necessary depending on team composition. If you aren't using a team like Hinata, Ui, Nykayoko, Ako and Himari, you will have at least one slot for an AoE dealer. And some units, like that Hinata, can pull double duty, largely eliminating the need for a dedicated AoE dealer. With enough AA you can also ignore AoE entirely, if your team can handle it. I kind of like that you have to take the mooks into consideration. I would agree with removing their crit chance and maybe making them slightly less effective at taking out your backline, though. There is something random about when the bears use their blast, and I don't know what it is, but it does affect how easily they kill units like Ui. Not sure if the rabbits' nukes are also random or not, haven't paid enough attention to them.\n\n> Lower Goz\u2019s crit resistance. I saw it\u2019s the same or similar amount to HOD, but it feels so much worse. Probably due to all the other RNG mechanics that can derail things in addition to missing crits.\n\nI'm split on this one. On one hand, I don't like resetting for crits, either. On the other hand, crit resistance is something that differentiates the bosses and that could potentially make different units useful for different raids. Kaho, for example, has much higher crit chance than Hinata with her bond gear. She could potentially be used without a crit buffer for Goz, allowing you to replace Ako (or just use Ako on another team). If every boss had the same crit resistance, that wouldn't be a consideration. But again, resetting for crits is pretty awful. You could blame that on crits being too important for damage output, though. Maybe it would help if there were some easily accessible crit buffers that aren't named Tomoe, or crit debuffers that aren't 3 stars. Buff Juri or Airi by giving them a crit resistance debuff, or something.\n\n> In P2, make it so hitting the clone with AAs and basic skills deal 50% of the damage. EX\u2019s can\u2019t be included due to Hinata, but it will make those depending on BS casts for damage to feel less bad. Also would make TS units more reliable.\n\nI don't really agree with this one either. I have a feeling that a lot of players wouldn't even realize that one was fake at that point. And if you miss which one's real when they split, it would make it harder to figure it out since you can't use the process of elimination. If you improve repositioning, this won't be an issue, so it has no reason to be changed if you fix movement.\n\n> Remove the healing debuff. They can keep the shielding mechanic and damage reduction it brings, but it\u2019ll allow small amounts of healing, like Ako or S Hoshino to work so one bit of bad luck won\u2019t tank a run due to a lack of healing.\n\nStrongly disagree with this one. Removing the healing debuff would take away its gimmick of shields over heals. If you make it so that there are at least some viable easily accessible shielders, it's not a problem to begin with. Buff Kotori's pull range and double her buff duration. Suddenly she's much more viable, even if you would need to keep her alive with her red armor on insane. That she's a back position unit helps a lot with that, luckily.\n\nIf you were to ask me, I would say that the issues that need fixing are movement, unit availability and excessive reliance on randomness. The last point includes the random hats and random train positions at the start. I don't mind that Goz is different; after all, every raid should have something that sets it apart from the others aside from damage and armor types. It's that some of these different things aren't working well that I consider an issue.",

You're also supposed to use repositioning effects to make your students dodge the trains, which will do a massive amount of damage if they hit.\n\nBy the way, the screen you see before entering the team formation screen should have symbols which you can press to see descriptions of the boss's skills.

            "> Is it just to scooch them closer to the correct one via somebody like Track Yuuka or Summer Shizuko?\n\nMainly, yes. Focus fire is mostly a convenience, particularly when you're using units that deal damage with targeted EX skills rather than AA and basic skills. I would say that Sizuna works for any color if you're doing a casual/comfy clear since her EX is cheap and she provides a free debuff. That she has low range makes her good at taking bombs for your potentially squishy red armored dealer, too, if on insane or above. I'm not sure that I'd use Sakurako just for her focus fire, though. At that point I think the convenience isn't worth the loss of a striker slot. And Noa's defense debuff does very little since Goz has such low defense so I wouldn't use her, either.",

As you noticed, Hinata has very low crit chance on Goz, but with Ako's buff it gets much higher.\n\nSince you have Mika and Nyfuuka, you can try using her on a separate team. It would allow you to shave off a few millions for the main team. Actually, I did a quick test with a UE50 level 85 Mika, Serina, Nyfuuka and three level 1 fillers, and did enough damage to enter phase 2. You probably can't replicate that with lower investments and levels, but you can likely deal a decent amount of damage with what you do have.

I tried both Aru and Mutsuki as my borrow, and I found Mutsuki way ~~easier~~ less awful.\n\nIf you bring Ui into team one, and have someone low-cost in the order, then if you're quick you can squeeze two Mutsuki casts into one Ako/Himari buff cycle. I set T.Yuuka, Mutsuki, and Ui as my starting skills, and my opening cycle went:\n\n1. T.Yuuka shields\n2. Ui on Mutsuki\n3. Wait until you're about to hit 10 cost, then drop to slowest speed\n4. Cast Mutsuki, then during her animation quickly cast Ako and Himari on her\n5. Use a cheap EX to cycle (but NOT Ui, since that overwrites Himari's buff)\n6. Quickly cast Mutsuki again just before the buffs expire\n\nWith a 2-cost EX in step 5, Yuuka's shields would expire right as this cycle finished, just in time to re-cast it to pull the team to the opposite side for the next train. For a 3-cost EX, it gave a couple more seconds unshielded and taking damage, so it was riskier.\n\nB.Toki has crit def shred, and without her debuff, you'll probably need your second team to finish him off. My own clear with her was really down to the wire. But you've got S.Shizuko, and that 20 bars you mention your second team can do should be enough.\n\nEdit: I tried a mock of my strat, subbing Akane in place of Toki, and I got him down to 18 bars. In hindsight Serika (or Shiroko if you have her) might have been better as a 2-cost filler since at least she can do colour-effective damage, and Akane's debuff is useless on Goz's low def, though I doubt it makes a real difference.

If you time it right you can do the same with basic skills.\n\nHere's another useful trick that can potentially help someone, though I don't think you will get any use out of it for now: When you need to move out of a train's path but your suicidal clowns have gone too far from the center, you can first use Sui to drag them closer to the middle, then Sshizuko so that they go for her immediately after they reach Sui's americano.

I have Iori on the far most right position of my team comp screen which puts her on the left flank during game and during the first wave I attack the mob group in the right most lane. It's hard to describe however if I aim at the center line most bunny mob of that group Iori's AOE usually hits the second one too. On her second shot she will re aim to the closest bear in the left lane group and the splash damage should hit the two bunny's behind too. If she crits she will finish off the bear as well. I have Iori next to Mika here so Mika usually finishes off the second bear of the left flank. Then for her third shot Iori will aim at a bear in the right flank group and take them out. Usually the last bear should be very low on health to get auto attacked down. \n\nFor the smaller 4 mob waves I aim Iori at the bears first.

They have derailed a number of my runs by firing their nuke immediately. But with the AoE component what I was getting at is paired with the crit res shred component. With the DPS, repo/shielder, maybe tank and buffers, there\u2019s really only one slot left for a student. So it\u2019s either being an AoE student or a crit res shred student, as I don\u2019t think there\u2019s someone with an AoE EX and crit res shred basic\u2026 \n\nSo if you choose the AoE student to kill the mobs, you have to restart  for crits, plus students running to the train/moving unpredictably, plus mobs using their skills right away, plus Goz bombs targeting the wrong student, plus small timing misses. Essentially there\u2019s too many little things that can go wrong and derail a run. \n\nLike with HOD the only two things you need to worry about are the CC and the crit resistance. So, while annoying, that makes it more predictable and allows you to squeeze in crit res shred if you need it. \n\nWith the clones taking damage, I find you\u2019re kinda screwed if you don\u2019t know the right one with the cards. As you waste too much time using EXs trying to find it. Yes it would be fixed with better, more reliable repositioning. But that\u2019s a lot more work for the devs than changing this component. Also, when you\u2019re sitting there waiting to see which lane the bomb will be in/waiting for it to go off so you can move, you aren\u2019t losing precious damage while hitting a clone you know is fake.\n\nThe reason I felt comfortable mentioning removing the healing debuff is three reasons. First, it\u2019s not a unique part of Goz as there\u2019s another blue, repositioning/shielding, and healing debuff raid in ShiroKuro. But that has other options to avoid damage like summoning terrain, unlike Goz. \n\nsecond, there\u2019s only so many students that have a shield and reposition (T Yuuka, Kotori, and S Shizuko) so it would allow for some amount of choice in the matter. But since there\u2019s a lot of incoming damage, you\u2019d have to commit a number of slots to healing to even have a shot of going shieldless.\n\nThird, I\u2019d keep the damage reduction from shielding, so that the shields are still highly preferable\u2026 but you\u2019d have options if you run out of shielders\n\nObviously unit availability is massive. There needs to be more options (especially low star/farmable) when a repo/shield combo is essential to a number of raids. And yes, Kotori needs a rework to make her viable, and S Shizuko needs a better pull range (she\u2019s fantastic otherwise). \n\nBut yeah\u2026something with Goz needs to change a bit.

            "Does not matter, at level 30, nothing survives more than 20s. and even if they do, they don't do damage. Level 87 maxed out Mutsuki does less than Mika, despite armor debuff. Mika can clear it super easily 1 level below, however, I can't seem to manage that at Hardcore in against the red boss. No, I use Himari for more abilities, and that girls that has 2 cost repositioning with a small heal.",
            "I guess I can try rolling good luck. Should I try letting Mika auto-attack the minions to reduce my damage taken, and only use spell on boss? Or rush boss, so I can kick it to stage 2?",
            "I'm not, cause even Saori lvl81, every skill maxed and ue40 + Himari max ex I could only damage Goz enough to get me to stage 2. Mutsuki lvl61 T4(didn't use her in a long time). Should I put her in stage 1? Unfortunately, the best red characters I can borrow are S.Hoshino and Small Shun. Oh, I didn't mention, but I have Hina74, Azusa68, Shun73, Shiroko70, but their skills are almost lvl1 or 3 . I have a lot of special DPS: Mashiro, Saya, S. Miyu and Hiyori, but they are all underinvested.",

            "Really wish I could pull off Yellow Insane. Feel like with maxed out Miku it should be feasible, but my LVL80 characters all get wiped in under a minute\u2026",

            "Assuming the shale.gg stats are correct, as long as you have a tier 3 amulet nothing in Goz should be able to crit that unit. Bears and rabbits should still have a 13% and 18% to crit your units that aren't wearing amulets, though. They gave Goz 0 crit, but for whatever reason, not the mooks.",

            "Huh yeah. I tried it with Tsubaki, it is indeed wonderful to help keep Mika alive. Between having something like S. Hoshino to squeeze more damage but have a immense headache with positioning, or Tsubaki, the latter is no contest. Even worse since we are talking about Goz.",
            "It's not a perfect solution, especially with Mika at the front, but you can try aiming away from Goz when repositioning. Your tank will run towards him and reduce the risk of everyone shuffling around and pushing the squishies closest to Goz. If you're having trouble keeping the top clown alive, Tsubaki is useful for phase 1. She has shorter range than Tyuuka and Mika (who are tied) so she's more likely to tank the bombs.",
            "Playing on phone is pain, but I'm using those thin touch screen pen it helps. A bigger screen for Goz is always better",
            "It's not the emulator.  I'm playing on iPhone (and only clearing well below recommended level) and have seen this issue.",

            "I see. yeah using Kotori is not fun",
            "Yes you\u2019re right. It did feel very bad lol\n\nEnded up going with borrowed Mika, Momoi, T Yuuka, Tsubaki and Himako. This left Goz with 1.8M.\n\nThen finished with Utaha DPS and blue armored students to stay alive. S Shizuko, S Hoshino, S Ui, Yuzu, and Kokona.",
            "Thanks for the hints\n\nYeah starting position matters so much for this raid. But what I found is the triple front liner setup was that the bunny mobs didn\u2019t line up to allow Iori to clear the bunnies in the first wave. Which meant taking too much damage and such. \n\nI was able to clear it with Momoi, Mika, Tsubaki, TYuuka and Himako with a mop up second team. \n\nBut yeah, it took a lot of time to figure out the right comp and positioning.",
            "Thank you for the info",
            "> I also tried including T.Hasumi instead of Toki for a bit of additional single-target damage.\n\nThasumi is actually pretty good for Goz, but only when she crits. And she has at most 30% crit chance on him with max skills and gear. If you use her, it should be as the main dealer, and as your buff target (especially Ako for the crit chance). But since a borrowed dealer will be better in your case, I don't recommend using her. At least not unless you need someone to finish him off when he's almost dead, so that you can easily reset for crits.\n\nFor the double EX buff thing, remember that Ui's EX overwrites Himari's attack buff, so avoid using it on your dealer when cycling skills for the second use. Himari has a shorter duration, so try to use Ako first to give yourself a slightly longer time window. Unless I'm mistaken 3 star Himari is enough to use Hinata twice if you're quick. Should be easier with a 2 cost cycler with Nykayoko missing. Maybe Btoki since she does provide a debuff, or Smiyako if you have her. Not sure how much the lack of Shoshino's cost regen matters there, honestly. Also, Aru's EX is really fast, so I don't think it's possible to use both buffs before the initial hit, at least not reliably. So if you use her it could be better to stick to one Aru EX per buff cycle. Mutsuki doesn't have that problem since her EX takes a long time to hit.",
            "On Extreme, Aru critting with buffs can chunk around 10 life bars off of the boss (on hit AND on explosion). Definitely viable.",
            ">\n\n>On smaller screens, possibly. Even so, I think having some way of keeping track of buffs and debuffs, other than memorizing application times and durations, would be a nice QoL.\n\nNot sure how they'll be able to adjust it without an icon that might take some screen time\n\n>You'd have to get rid of permanent buffs from specials and such, too. And keep the self buffs that aren't permanent. I get what you're saying, though.\n\nThis is true. However Not many special students have perm buffs that buffs parties. They can however make the Special student perm buffs a different color example Green for perm buffs and red for temporary buffs",
            "Right, that too. I haven't done Insane yet so I tend to forget about that.\n\nI guess at some point I'm going to need to figure out which of the red tanks in my roster to raise, Eimi or Haruka.",
            "Can't say for sure in NA. I'm also NA with 2,1,2 insane clears but hovering around 700. The late comers always do it near end since the tickets accumulate so it's hard to tell with GA unlike TA",
            "NA is pretty chill. 3x insane clears have always been plat guaranteed on every Grand Assault, doesn't matter the score. I don't see this being the exception (quite the opposite considering how annoying the raid is)",
            "I only have a good Mutsuki and an underleveled Ui. I can't imagine bringing her in this inferno without her constantly dying.",
            "I did it! I properly timed Hina's ex in phase 1 with the spawning ads, then I borrowed an overlevelled Aru and added fillers with low cost ex + increased recovery passives, and amazingly it was enough.\n\nI don't know how I would have done it without S!Shizuko, though. She carried all my teams so hard and I didn't even level her that much.",
            "I had not read your comment correctly, but thank you for your reply. I'll look into it, maybe borrow an Aru from my club.",
            "I didn't use Ui at all. Mika for phase 1 and Wakamo/SIzuna for phase 2",
            "> Yeah. The fact that having T Yuuka, Wakamo, NY Kayoko, Himako, S Hanako, etc still isn\u2019t enough for blue insane kinda shows how silly the requirements for Goz are.\n\nEven though Wakamo isn't as over tuned as Mika and terrain is bad she should still pack a punch like in other raids. But here she feels barely more powerful than my T.Hasumi. I know Wakamo is doing more damage but she is just so much harder to time and use here. \n\nGoz also has much more health and ATK than Hod. Granted Hod has more time consuming CC mechanics but I don't think that offsets how much damage Goz and its mobs do, its health pool, and the RNG (both positioning for auto attack skills and crit RNG). Aru and Wakamo can usually comfortably DPS down other bosses on insane but here I'm only getting some what tight extreme clears with them.\n\nAlso I'm not sure how useful Ui would be here. I tried using her but she just dies way too quickly to provide comfy clears. I gave up and started using NY.Fuuka if I really need cost reduction.",
            "Yeah Mika is a gorilla at early levels.\n\nBut Aru and Mutsuki should be able to take care of it pretty easily. Just try adding people with UE40+ Arus on your friends search. Filter by lvl 81-90. Find a lvl 87. Click on the i right above their icon and see what units they have\n\nYou can tell if a unit is UE40 if their passive skill has a + on it. And UE50 will normally have the sunglasses mood for an environment",
            "Hinata will slay blue goz in an instant",
            "T.Yuuka matters since she gives a shield which reduces damage taken in this raid. If you don't have her, you may be able to try something with Kotori or S.Shizuko which also shield the team and reposition.",

Or rush boss, so I can kick it to stage 2?\n\nI assume you meant your borrowed dps. Personally I used the ex once in the first stage because the clumping seemed good for it so that aru could switch auto attacks and normal skills to the boss.",
            "Gotcha. If you're planning to use S. Hinata for Team 1, then probably use Shiroko since her EX is cheaper. Else, invest in Mutsuki since she will become either your main or sub dps in a lot of red raids.  \n  \nBorrow S.Hoshino if her skills are decently leveled (especially EX) since she will give you more damage and cost recovery. Put her with Saori for Stage 2 and you can probably kill Goz faster.",
            "You should join a club. You get access to borrows and 10 free AP a day. You can also send friend requests to random people, because many will gladly accept you since they get credits when you borrow their units. Borrowing a fully invested dealer is usually enough to let you complete hardcore difficulty, even as a new player.",
            "Yeah.. Goz is a different breed of raid boss unfortunately. Don't stress too much on defeating him since a lot of players are actually struggling with beating him on every difficulty.",
            "[Mika can literally solo Yellow Harcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnASJfRL2w8) and probably can do it for Blue too.\n\nSo yeah, you really should look for a club or borrow from someone. Are you NA? I can lend you my Mika if you are.",
            "What's your team? Goz will delete red armor students on insane+ even if they are max lvl.",
            "Not sure if Miku can help that much since heals are heavily reduced in here. Shields, extra damage or damage buffer will help more",
            "My S.Hina is UE30, skills M444, equip 888, unique item T1, and she works fine for clearing the mobs. I have been able to 1 team in mock, but 2 teams is much less frustrating.",
            "Yeah, the S. Hina will be used to clear the mobs in Stage 1, while you focus fire on Goz using your main dps. Be careful though, Mutsuki and Aru are Light armor which can easily die if positioned wrongly. Try them out in Mock battle first to get a feel on how to use them.",
            "I feel bad to drag her out. Poor girl get bullied by the smug cat left and right.",
            "Top clown? Was that an auto correct typo and you meant tank? I will play around a bit more with two team comps. But with dropping Ui and using NY.Fuuka instead along with Iori and S.Hanako for sub DPS and support (S.Hanako for yellow armor and some small DEF debuff benefit) I can get Goz down pretty consistently to 8X health with my first team. My second team finishes him off quickly with Maki and NY.Haruka (one of the few times she can strut her stuff).\n\nI might be able to two team blue but I think I have to give up on insane red with how damn squishy Mutsuki and Aru are while lacking enough borrows and my own units to properly run a two team comp.",

            ">Can just time her ex between the trains\n\nOr use her EX to fix her in place and stop her from running back in front of the damn things after you've repositioned her away.",
            "If you have Ui , you should try with a borrowd Mika. Was working too like i said in my previous comment",
            "I'm using S.Ui, T.Yuuka, Mika, Iori and NY.Fuuka, Himari in that order left to right. It's a little bit RNG because S.Ui's reposition can fuck up your positioning and Iori is squishy (S.Ui is not too bad because of armor type). But I'm able to get a 1 team clear by the skin of my teeth, like a 5-10 second margin. My comfy two team clear swapped in S.Hanako instead of S.Ui. S.Hanako is essentially there to just face tank (she's not too bad given armor type), I don't even use her EX though it's not too bad and lowers mob HP down low enough that Mika can take care of the rest with auto attack. Her DEF down only provides a small boost here since Goz has low DEF. My second team used Maki as main DPS along with NY.Haruka. Usually first team could get Goz down to 5-8x HP and Maki could take him out in one EX burst with NY.Haruka.",
            "I haven't tried Hinata again but I could get it working on Mutsuki. I still can't get enough damage output though; about 2.5M left, which is more than an unshielded cleanup team can manage. Edit: it seems to have helped more on Hinata. Didn't quite 1-team the latest mock, but it was seconds away and T.Hasumi's cleanup team finished it off fast enough that lack of shields didn't matter. Now it's a question of repeatability. I could live with 2 Extreme and 1 Hardcore if need be and Red doesn't cooperate.\n\nDoesn't help that my runs keep getting thwarted by the issue that after a round of Mutuski, my next step is usually to reapply Yuuka's shields. So on the round that ends phase, I will consistently be in the process of aiming Yuuka's EX when the scene changes, which treats it as being cast even though I don't actually do so and my finger was still touching the screen. Then when the clones appear I need a full rotation to get my reposition back. One could argue that I should be watching the health bar more closely and know it's going to happen, but I think it's bullshit that I have to. It should cancel in that situation, given that it's a point where I could still cancel manually.",
            "The attempts at trying to get two Hinata EXes out of a buff cycle seems to have paid off. I only had five seconds left, and if Hinata's last EX hadn't critted I'd have been in a bad spot, but a clear's a clear. That's Blue down.\n\nI spent a ticket on a Hardcore Red as a contingency, in the event that I decide not to chase Extreme. At least I have a clear that doesn't rely on a borrow to carry me.",
            "And if she doesn't crit, she does less than two bars, and she usually doesn't crit, Ako or not. 40 rotations isn't viable.",

You wouldn't be able to change it on the fly without pausing, but that doesn't matter. Although, if you do want a feature like that, you can have settings for it like always on, always off, and toggleable. The last one would allow you to toggle it whenever, by clicking on a button in the top left, for example.\n\n> However Not many special students have perm buffs that buffs parties.\n\nAll of them have sub skills that buff the team, so that's two permanent buffs that clutter up the buff list.",
            "> 3x insane clears have always been plat guaranteed on every Grand Assault, doesn't matter the score\n\nThis is not true, we've hit 3x insane cutoff for a few GAs now.",
            "That\u2019s a pretty nice combo =). \n\nGlad it worked out for you. That crit res shred is really helpful to make Wakamo work smoothly",
            "Yeah Wakamo is rough for this. Cause that crit resistance which causes her BS crits to miss, plus all the other repositioning/aoe component makes it hard to time everything for her\n\nBut HOD at least felt a bit predictable. Where Goz\u2026isn\u2019t lol. I was able to use my own 4 star Aru for HOD clears, but a UE50 one here can\u2019t get close enough for me to use mine on team 2 and still not have a shot. So yeah, it\u2019s not just you lol\n\nUi was just to make Hinata happen as I haven\u2019t had a shot at rolling for NY Fuuka yet and don\u2019t have Hinata. So Ui would\u2019ve been my one real shot at blue with Hinata. But I do realize how much of a pain a red armored striker is for this raid\u2026",
            "Good to know thanks!",
            "Tried a few mock runs, and Hinata dies before she kills hardcore phase 2 solo. Mika doesn't come close to death.",
            "Even with damage reductions, and lets say everyone survives. At hardcore, they will do 1-2% of the rest of the teams damage. Keeping them alive does not do a whole lot for me. I already have a major lack of red dps. I'm 15 above 3 staring yellow levels. But I barely handle red levels that are my level.",
            "Ah, I see. Your borrowed Aru did more in 20s, than I managed in 2 minutes lol. I could not manage to get to stage 2 before dying. My club has 0 Arus, and 0, Red dps.\n\nI also thought Aru was yellow damage for some reason. I was so sure about it from playing chapter 1. Thanks for the video, I will try finding someone with an Aru, because it looks dope.\n\nEdit: Tried it with level 82 Aru, and my experience has been very different. Damage output is nowhere near, and she can barely keep up with minions. While she takes a lot more damage than that.",
            "Yes! Thank you! I still have to optimise the first team, because i needed another between S.Hinata and Saori t\u00f4 take me to stage 2, but I think I already have the pieces at least.",
            "Im global sadly but thanks for the tips didn't know that's something you can even do",
            "Top clown being the girl that insists on running up close to Goz despite having red armor.\n\nI don't recommend using Shanako for yellow armor Goz. Goz has very low defense so her debuff does almost nothing. She can be used for mook clearing for blue and maybe red, though her sticky EX skill can potentially cause problems when cycling.",
            "Mika moment",

            "I have regular Ui, not S.Ui.",
            "Congrats on making the S Ui clear work. Yeah, I had a hard time balancing her repo with cost and damage. S Hanako did become quite useful this raid cause she\u2019s just too good. The one downside for her is her amazing sub skill, which means you can\u2019t use her EX to cycle lol",
            "At least you only have to do it once for Grand Assault.",
            "Yep. Was 100 away from plat on Hod with 3 insane clears, two of which were one team lol.\n\nWent 1 insane, 2 hardcore this time, so doubt it\u2019ll hold unless if the cat pissed off too many people",
            "Yeah when people say that Wakamo isn't crit reliant an asterisk should be there for Goz. Wakamo still kind of needs to crit with her BS at least once to fill up her EX accumulation damage. For most bosses with 100 crit res she should crit at least once in the BS skill's three hits with a 50% crit chance while buffed with Ako. However Goz lowers her crit chance down to like 33% and there's a very real chance she doesn't crit for all three hits and her EX damage plummets. \n\nI would definitely plan for NY.Fuuka if possible. TBH I don't use Ui too much. I know lots of people say she is squishy but most bosses that I use her on don't do red damage so it isn't too bad; except this one, here she can almost die instantly. However NY.Fuuka is just much more convenient for a wider variety of bosses.",
            "Aru in particular gets a lot of her power near maxing since her unique equipment boosts her crit damage. Try to find a maxed one if you can.\n\nI get the feeling other single target red dps could do it with similar or even less effort too, but I don\u2019t have the club members or friends to test alternatives.",
            "Np. Like RequiringQuestion said, if you don't want to join a club, you should at least  look at friends for unit you want to borrow. You can go there by going to the Menu tab -> Friends -> Manage Friends -> Search Friends -> Filter 81-90\n\nThere is no social pressure since you can't chat with your friends in this game lol.",

            "She's just there as a body throw so I can keep my EX regen up. I don't use her EX and Iori is still my mob clearer. Otherwise none of my non red armor yellow DPS or support are leveled up enough. I have S.Ui but have not upgraded her one bit in the past and don't have the credits to do it now.",
            "Gg ! Red is the hardest for newer player for sure but this will change with dress hina ! I had to lvl my mutsuki to 87 with Max all skill (except accuracy) and it was pretty tight",
            "Yeah S.Hanako is still more suited to being a primary DPS. I have to do some weird juggling of Ako and Himari skills to cycle correctly.",
            "Yep. If you could squeeze in crit res shred into the team Wakamo becomes viable. But that is a big if for P1. If you\u2019re in P2 it becomes much more manageable.\n\nAnd I definitely will get NY Fuuka. I will have the savings for her, so yeah. Ui I realize isn\u2019t perfect, but at least gives some possibility on certain raids. Or give you two chances for cost reduction for two teams. But right now I\u2019m just hoping Ui spooks me\u2026",
            "Yeah, unlikely, I tried searching the friends lists, and nobody lists Aru at all. I'll most likely will settle for 1 level below if I don't manage to. They may do it, do hunting anything maxed out red is so hard, people don't listen yellow, purple or blues.",
