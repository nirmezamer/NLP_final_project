Besides all of drake\u2019s nasty behavior, how tf travis and 21 savage date Rubi Rose when she was underage??? And how did tyga just get away with dating Kylie at 17? Or Juice dating a 14 y/o at 18? \n\nAnd specifically about X, it\u2019s crazy that people thought he flew out a 16 year old model who was a fan of his for \u201cjust a photo shoot.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising he did this shit.\n\nY\u2019all think your favorite rapper isn\u2019t participating in this nasty shit with minors?

Basically she didn\u2019t do shit to actually help suffering people. Many of the people under her care died in complete agony\n\nFirst of all, the purpose of Mother Teresa's organization was to care for the dying (feeding them, treating their wounds) who were not accepted in hospitals.\n\nSecondly, you're misunderstanding the concept of 'redemptive suffering.' Simply put, it means that even in dire pain, there is purpose. It's meant to bring hope to the hopeless, not to suggest that pain itself is good or that you should encourage it.\n\nIn Mother Teresa's private writings, she clearly expresses sorrow for the suffering of her patients, and her sisters have stated several times that they did everything within their means to alleviate the patients' suffering. If she truly encouraged suffering, why would she help the dying in the first place? Why not simply leave them on the streets?\n\n>  Contradicting her own beliefs, she seeked medical treatment for her ovarian cysts\n\nThe people around her indicated that she never voluntarily sought treatment but was 'forced' to accept it when the opportunity arose, such as after suffering a sudden heart attack.\n\nYou could argue that mother Teresa was incompetent, but a bad person?

Only change I went through between 16 and 19 was I started smoking weed, that\u2019s it. Same sense of humor, same hobbies, same everything. None of my friends changed either. This difference is always so over exaggerated. A 19 year old is not a pedo for liking someone 3 years younger and anyone who says otherwise is socially retarded. Then again, this sub is 90% teenage rejects with 0 friends so of course yall have no understanding of this, probably haven\u2019t been in a single relationship yet.",
            "Man I was with most of what was being said until this. Maturity is not a complete black and white thing by any means. Sure, it's an objective fact that there's varying levels of maturity between varying environments, but even then it's not even something you can quantify. I know of kids at 16 who held themselves at a much higher maturity level than anyone else who was 21. There is not some magic barrier you hit at a certain age where you're all of a sudden completely self-sufficient and independent. Travel to some other countries and then you'll really start to understand what I'm saying.\n\nAlso, I don't think anyone is denying that in the majority of cases it is odd for a 3 year age gap to exist at such a young age. But to claim that it is a result of pedophilia is absolutely absurd",
            "It\u2019s absurd. The age range is similar, probably similar maturity and life experience too. The only real difference between myself when I was a 16 year old and when I was a 19 year old is I didn\u2019t smoke weed when I was 16 and I did when I was 19.

            "we could make the debate that A$AP Rocky is bigger than him it\u2019s just he\u2019s not as relevant right now because he hasn\u2019t did shit this year unlike carti who has done a few features & teases. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "He\u2019s featured on the upcoming NAV album, he did a song with Camilla Cabello who isn\u2019t as relevant as he is rn. Not to mention Carti has strong ass ties to A$AP Mob or whatever",
            "isnt rocky one of the first people carti ever worked with? Also carti is only bigger because of carnival and fein right now",

I know they feature rappers sometimes on their tracks but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve heard them featured on a rap album. Then again Rocky had a song like Sundress maybe he\u2019s going for that vibe.\n\nEdit: they\u2019ve apparently worked w a lot of rappers/r&b, Ty dolla, Pharrell, Rocky (Frankenstein), usher, The Weeknd",

            "That\u2019s really interesting actually, i suspect it\u2019s cuz mainly clams\u2019 name is synonymous with cloud rap on the production side and rocky\u2019s tape is associated with the movement\n\nin reality live love asap has a decent variety of producers, ofc clams is the main one but dj burn one, spaceghostpurrp, ty beats, olympicks even smaller guys like beautiful lou did beats\n\nthe blog era was really special man",
