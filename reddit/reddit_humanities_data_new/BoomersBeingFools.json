The latter would seem to be covered by the \"elderly\" portion, but I've also seen a lot of comments that \"Boomer is more about attitude than actual generation\" and I'm inclined to agree, particularly when generation start/end dates are somewhat arbitrarily determined by the actual personality characteristics most commonly shared by members of the generation.\n\nSomething along the lines of \"boomers are anyone who looks like they may be in their late 50's or older\", or even just \"anyone exhibiting foolish behavior commonly associated with members of the Baby Boomer generation, regardless of their actual age\" might cut down on some of the sidebar arguments.",

If we're restricted to ONLY Baby Boomers as defined as when the generation was born, then put that in the rules, the current rules are arbitrary concerning the definition of a boomer.

Second, bigots rarely admit that they\u2019re bigots.\n\nBut here\u2019s a little guide for you:\n\nWhen someone posts something about an individual doing something stupid, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s not ageism. \n\nBut then\u2026 on every thread here\u2026 the conversation changes to one about how the story illustrates how Boomers in general are awful. That\u2019s ageist, and is no different morally than generalizing about black people. \n\nAnd often, the threads go further and say that they can\u2019t wait for Boomers to die. That\u2019s hate speech. I\u2019ve reported a ton of those. Most are not here anymore, but since this is a mod thread I\u2019d invite them to tell you if I\u2019m lying."

Apparently it pissed my mom off more because she handed my daughter back to me and started to take off her rings saying, \"My DAUGHTER is caring for my granddaughter, SHE does not babysit unlike your useless sack of shit husband.\"\n\nThat led to me holding my tiny mom back from kicking the shit out of another Boomer woman while trying not to laugh.

Kid is still crying as we are passing the Boomer couple (now chatting with other Boomers) and we overhear their conversation:\n\n\"Oh sounds like someone didn't get the flavor they wanted!\"\n\n\"That would never be me, if my kids had acted like that I would have beat their ass!\"\n\nMy husband loudly mocks them by parroting what they said back to them with a \"ha-ha-ha isn't child abuse FUNNY?\"\n\nEdit: reading through comments and I'm so sorry to all of you who have experienced abuse as children under the guise of \"discipline.\" My older gen x mother also hit me with a flyswatter, but my friend was hit repeatedly with a belt then forced to do push ups. I am so grateful to see we are changing and breaking the generational trauma. ",

She is in her 20s now and is an extremely polite and sweet young lady who works full-time and has never gotten into trouble with the law or anything like that.  She also never got spanked a day in her life.\n\nWhat her parents did was to teach her to have respect.  Respect for the feelings of others, respect for the property of others, respect for authority, respect for the beliefs and needs of others, and respect for herself.  \n\nThat's when I changed my tune and now it grinds my gears to hear people say, \"These kids nowadays are out of control because they never get their a$$es beat like I did when I was a kid!\"  Guess what, prisons are full of people who definitely got their a$$es beat, how exactly did it help them??  Maybe it would have been better to simply teach them the importance of respect.",

            "As someone who was regularly beat with a police duty belt for almost a year (family rescued me) for the simplest of \"infractions\" (I got beat from my neck to my ankles with it because I changed out of my school uniform into regular \"nicer\" clothing for church on a Wednesday one time for example) I will absolutely say two things: 1- what most consider a spanking is absolutely abuse and doesn't teach the child anything other than fear, and 2- there is a VERY easy line to cross between punishment and abuse. And certain people will do and say anything to \"justify\" it. Abuse cannot be justified. \n\nI will also say that, since I was beaten regularly at the care givers place and my family rescued me, taking things away from me as punishment (because they refused to put hands on me due to abuse, not because they didn't believe in it) taught me ABSOLUTELY NOTHING other than patience and how to sneak or find ways around having things taken from me. \n\nCar keys taken from me? That's fine, I have friends who don't mind picking me up to hang out. Game system taken from me? That's fine, I have books to read and a tv to watch. Grounded to my room and only allowed out for school/food/bathroom? Okay, I go to bed far later than you do and as long as you don't wake up earlier than your routine bathroom trips, I'm fine. I'll go sit on the porch or something. Once I had everything (tv, phone, computer, car, grounded to my room) taken from me for two weeks and I said \"okay, just means you'll have to wake me up for school and take me there. Also means you'll have to remember my bed time. I've got books, I'll be okay.\"\n\nMaybe I was just a fluke?

I don't fully blame the older generation as they didn't know what they didn't know. No one had taught them another way. But in 2024 if you are still hitting or threatening to hit your child you have no excuse. You are a selfish lazy monster.

I wasn't deliberately lying, I was just remembering having fed the dog the day before and got confused, or thought I had brought something home from school when I hadn't, or accidently lost something, or refused to apologize because I didn't think I had done anything wrong.\n\nMy parents swore that I was a problem child too, when I was just scatterbrained and struggling to make my brain work in the way they wanted. It was a terrible way to grow up and really played a part in destroying my relationship with them.",
            "My mom has told me I missed a few spankings. I was the youngest so I didn\u2019t get as many as my older siblings. I\u2019m 30 now and she\u2019s said that within the last year. She says that rather than admitting or acknowledging that she messed up or hear what I have to say.",

As an adult somehow the topic came up and my mom was like \"I stopped spanking you the day I realized I was doing it out of anger\"and expressed the sentiment of how was something done out of an inability to control her own emotions and feelings going to help teach me better control of my own?",
            "I love my mom dearly, but that sounds a lot like her. She's definitely one of the low-tolerance types. I've always said she should have never had kids because she didn't have the patience for it. She was worse with my sister since my sister had a behavioral disorder. Now though? \n\nMy sister will absolutely throw hands with anybody that pisses her off, but she won't even so much as raise her voice to her kids. Even our mom says Sis is a better mother than she ever was. Sis told me it's because she thought of the way we were raised and decided to do the opposite... Other than my niece having the same attitude as her mother, those are the two sweetest, and most well behaved kids I've ever seen.",

I wasn't connecting it at all with my behavior being bad, which is why I didn't change my behavior. I had no idea how to avoid getting hit, or that it was even an option. I just thought whoever was bigger got to hit people and right now that was her.\u00a0\n\n\nSo she apparently cried and quit with me.",

Granny used to use a wooden spatula. Mom used a chancla/flip flop. My sister just spanked.\n\nI was the fuck up, difficult, bad attitude kid of the seven of us. I remember one time I got in trouble for talking back to a teacher in 9th grade, so my mom decided to spank me, as a 14 year old. All it did was piss me off, made me hate her guts, sleep in class, and avoid coming home or being there when she was there. \n\nAfter that point, I started getting into much worse shit, but it wisened me to hide it and not go home when I got caught.\n\nA few years ago my psychiatrist finally convinced me to go to a trauma therapist where I was diagnosed with CPTSD. The big thing I realized is that my mom's emotional volatility alienated me from her and created a childhood of anxiety. Her attempt to discipline me by spanking me at 14 ensured an unhealthy and unhealable relationship. The CPTSD started well before that but is an iconic example of how boomers sucked at raising kids with mental and emotional problems. Often making those problems worse, if they weren't the cause of them.",

All the aunts and uncles are traumatized to hell, even to this day, and the youngest two have had the most issues. They\u2019ve both been to prison and can\u2019t hold down normal jobs. Drug and alcohol use is rampant. So I would say that they didn\u2019t successfully beat it out of them, they just added to the problems the kids were already dealing with. \n\nUnfortunately the aunts and uncles don\u2019t think the physical abuse negatively impacted them, so they still use it on their kids from time to time, with the excuse of \u201cI turned out fine.\u201d  No, no you didn\u2019t turn out fine. \n\nThe fact that people still justify hitting their kids is beyond me.",

They just don\u2019t tell you about all the ways they\u2019re not fine because of your parenting because it\u2019s exhausting to be gaslit about your own childhood.

I wasn't allowed to leave my room except to go to school or the bathroom. When I needed to eat, I was allowed to make myself a bologna sandwich or PB&J, but I had to take it right back to my room. I wasn't allowed to be in the living room.  This would go on for days until she decided I was punished enough.   And any minor infraction could set her off. It was like she was looking for a reason to punish me to make herself feel better, which is what spanking does for these assholes too. I didn't see it as a form of abuse until I was fully grown with kids of my own and was finally seeing a therapist to work all this shit out with.",
            "Out of both parents and two kids, the only physical punishment was from my mom to me both times (I don't remember either time, I was a toddler for both). The first, she took her eyes off me for a second, and I ran straight into the road. She said I came about 12 inches from being splattered, and she just freaked and hit me while screaming at me to never ever go in the road. I didn't cross the street without holding an adult's hand until I was 6 or so. The second, I bit her nose and absolutely refused to let go, so after multiple attempts at begging, she popped me enough to startle me into letting go. Apparently I bit her hard enough to give her two black eyes from all the swelling. \n\nI feel like both of those situations were pretty forgivable. But both my parents were beat to hell for the most minor infractions, and they were dead set against repeating that with their own kids. Good thing, too, because my little brother was the BEST at pushing both their buttons.",

If I ever hit my kid, which I won\u2019t ever do, but even if I believed spanking was the right way to punish a child, I would feel terrible no matter what. In fact, it\u2019s one of the reasons I waited until my late 30s to have a kid. In my 20s, I thought spanking was necessary (because my parents said so) so I figured it would be better to have no children.",

Never happened again.  Also Gen X.",

But the minute they can get away with it, they will do it. \n\nIt also \"teaches\" the things you do not want to- like that violence is appropriate way to manage emotions, that being hypervigilent and managing adult feeling is an essential survival skill, etc.",

            "But she sure was comfortable telling you how to feel about your own trauma.

Call them on it. They DO know better but want the simplistic answer of hitting kids to be true anyway because it doesn't require engaging with them on an emotional level.",

            "I was moreso thinking it was an \"action-reaction\" effect.... sort of like negative reinforcement, without having to hurt anyone.\n\nWith training dogs, I yelp and the game stops, so doggy learns that I have been impacted by something and it's not funny cuz now we're not playing (I'm not giving them positive or negative attention, I'm just moving away).\n\nSo maybe with very young children, it could indirectly show that their actions have consequences. More age appropriate than trying to teach them why hitting is wrong when they are only just learning how to control their own limbs lol. \n\nI agree that it's too much to expect toddlers to express remorse or guilt. Hitting, kicking, biting; all those are totally age appropriate reactions for toddlers. Easier to teach a toddler to have gentle hands and redirect those physical urges towards something more appropriate (maybe throw a ball outside or push toy cars into building blocks) than it is to teach then a lesson by punishing them for biting or hitting and then expecting them to feel remorse and reflect on it.\n\nThey are babies, so we take baby steps with them^^ I think as adults we gotta re-learn how to do that sometimes lol.",

            "> Compare this with the forums for adult children of abusers, where the members not only cut-and-paste email exchanges into their posts, they take photos of handwritten letters and screenshot text conversations. They recreate scenes in detail, and if the details don't add up, the other members question them about it. They get annoyed when a member's paraphrase changes the meaning of a sentence, or when omitted details change the meaning of a meeting. They care about precision, context, and history.\n\nI grew up in an abusive home. There was a lot of violence, verbal abuse and starvation was used as a means of punishment or control. There was also sexual abuse, but to this day I don\u2019t know the extent of. Maybe it was brief. Maybe it spanned a long period of time. \n\nI\u2019m in my late 40\u2019s and have been in and out of therapy since I was around 22 or 23 when I could first afford the copays to see a therapist. I had very few and fragmented memories. Things were so consistently bad that it was hard to remember any specific moments in detail. It was just life for 17 years. Even some of the most traumatic events were missing from memory. I\u2019ve learned some things from others recounting what they had witnessed. \n\nI have spoken with many people who grew up in similar circumstances. One thing many of us have are years of missing memory from growing up. It\u2019s just blank. I couldn\u2019t tell you details about what is missing from memory. I\u2019ve pieced enough together from things my significantly older brothers have told me. Some others that witnessed things have asked me about what the circumstances were when they witnessed something. Once in a while I\u2019ll get a flashback when someone starts to talk about something specific, but generally I don\u2019t. I could fit in a couple of paragraphs what I remember about the first 17 years of my life. \n\nThe problem with having years of memories missing (suppressed or whatever mechanism is keeping them from me within my own mind), is that it can make a survivor of abuse question themselves. It can make you wonder if things were all that bad. Or maybe you are embellishing or making up how bad things were. Maybe I *was* the problem. They told me constantly that I was, and since I don\u2019t remember so much, or lack such detail, maybe the things they would say to me were true. That\u2019s how I felt for many years. \n\nI don\u2019t envy the people who remember things in detail. My mind for whatever reason is remaining mostly blank or incredibly vague to the point that it\u2019s hard to determine what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. I\u2019ve come to accept that the bulk of the first couple of decades are lost to time. There\u2019s also the unreliability of memory. Key points may be able to be recalled, but details are fuzzy at best. \n\nForums can be incredibly helpful in getting support from others who grew up in similar circumstances. Sometimes someone will talk about an epiphany they had in therapy about how past events and experiences are the root cause of some struggles they are having in their life now. Maybe it\u2019s a repeating pattern of behavior or emotions that don\u2019t make sense. Maybe it\u2019s just a perspective change or something that has empowered the survivor. Picking apart details can be incredibly isolating for some people. It can cause them to shut down. It can cause them to go back to being silent. \n\nI just wanted to point out that for some of us, we\u2019re caught in limbo in trying to move on with our lives. Parents sometimes outright deny that there were any larger issues, but like one of my parents will follow that with how hurt they are that they only hear from their 4 children once or twice a year. The level of denial or making themselves out to be the victim is astounding. Said parent is in their late 70\u2019s. Has no retirement. Gets a pittance of Social Security and lives in a subsidized retirement home. I\u2019m dreading the day that they require round the clock care.

When I was 11 years old (now 37), I went to a dental appointment with my grandmother. While waiting for her in the waiting room, I suddenly heard her scream from another room. When I went to check, I saw blood everywhere\u2014on her face and clothes, on the floor, and on the dentist. The dentist had accidentally cut her tongue so badly that she eventually won a lawsuit for damages. This incident left me with a lasting fear of dentists.\n\nAfter some research, I found a dental office with a knowledgeable and caring approach to trauma. I emailed back and forth with the doctor and staff, shared my concerns, and booked an appointment. On the day of the appointment, I was treated very well when I walked in. The staff made a conscious effort to make me comfortable without being patronizing. After chitchatting with the front desk ladies, I sat next to an older woman in the waiting area.\n\nAs soon as I sat down, she turned to me and asked, \"Why are you getting the VIP treatment?\" I shrugged and said it was my first time there, and they were just being welcoming. She then complained that the place was never friendly to her despite her spending \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" there, which seemed unlikely given the office had only been open for about eight months. Noticing my nervousness, she asked why I was anxious. I briefly explained my grandma's incident, and she lost it.\n\nShe accused me of exaggerating the event, claiming kids are not good at perception, and suggested I was using this fear to justify being lazy about my oral care. She said, \"Kids these days are always looking to blame their past and not take accountability,\" and mentioned her own kids barely speak to her anymore. The final straw was when she told me that \"my generation\" needs to toughen up and understand that such events shape our character.\n\nI finally interrupted her, saying, \"I have a PhD in Psychology, and the trauma from that incident actually made me interested in studying trauma and its impact on youth as they grow up. So yes, it did shape me.\" She retorted that I should have learned how to get over it if I had so much education in the field. I responded, \"Maybe you should get educated before you speak about something you know nothing about and keep your nose out of people's business.\"\n\nShe then got up and complained about me to the front desk, but the staff defended me, saying, \"We saw you instigating the poor boy. Take a seat and stay quiet.\"\n\nI appreciated the support from the front desk ladies. It's unfortunate that this woman felt the need to invalidate my fears and continue the conversation, but it was reassuring to feel supported by the staff.\n\nEdit: spelling.",
