I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. \"Give me five bees for a quarter,\" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones..",

This persistence enraged the man, and his mind withered quicker than his marmalade mane.  \nIn a final act of desperation, he gathered the last of his plasticine strength to turn our own countrymen and family against one another in a spiteful civil war.  \nAnd although the wicked goblin finally departed back to his burning depths below, the hatred he left still resonates our nation\u2019s air even today.\u201d",
