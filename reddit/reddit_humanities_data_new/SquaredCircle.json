He recounts Drew kicking him while he was down, and he decided to go the Chicago route, he wouldn't stay down. Punk planned to bury his career 6 feet under -- he just didn't think it would be that easy. He was looking forward to doing more bad things to him, but Drew took his ball and went home. Paul Heyman interrupts, saying he's not here in disrespect, despite being the Wise Man to the tribal chief Roman Reigns - he's here in an urgent situation. Punk says, you don't look so good... and Heyman gives him a big, long hug. Paul says driving in he heard on sports radio that Chicago is CM Punk's town, and that really pissed off Solo Sikoa. Now that he's the Head of the Table, he wants every town to be his town, and he wants a favor & a favor back. He says once Punk is cleared, folks will be in the ring with the Best in the World, but they don't care right now, they'll come for him. Heyman reiterates that with love and respect, please get the hell out of here right now. Punk is incredulous that Solo & the Tongans would think to ambush him in Chicago.\n\n* Sikoa's music hits and Solo says, if he wants to be on his show, he's got two options -- either pay his respects to him and the Bloodline, or they'll make sure his ass never gets cleared. Punk asks Paul, what's the favor he wanted if he does this for him? Paul says, take me with you. CM Punk acknowledges... that he doesn't see the Bloodline standing in front of him, he sees a bunch of fake-ass usos and a cosplay tribal chief. The Bloodline enters the ring, and from behind Punk, Cody Rhodes enters the ring with two baseball bats. Cody says he fashions himself as the head of the table right? Well I've already beaten the head of the table. So why not leave the family backstage and we settle this tonight. \n\n* Corey Graves notes that security is increased tonight after the events on Monday Night Raw.\n\n* Jade Cargill talks to Bianca Belair backstage about getting their rematch for their tag team titles. But Bianca says tonight she has to focus on her Money in the Bank qualifying match.\n\n* Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa is set for later tonight; Randy Orton chats with Cody backstage and asks if he really wants to do this? But Cody says yeah, he's sure. Kevin Owens is also there and is concerned, but Cody says he has a plan.\n\n* Blair Davenport chats with Bayley who was watching the match backstage, asking her to relay to Naomi that she's really looking to face her in the MITB qualifying match next week. And she's really looking forward to cashing in on Bayley.\n\n* Paul Heyman is in the Bloodline dressing room with Solo Sikoa staring him down. Solo demands he tell the Tongans that KO and Randy are to be taken out. Paul asks, you want me to do it? Solo says, if I say I want you to do it, you'll do it. And when he comes back, the two of them need to talk.\n\n* Kayla Braxton talks with Grayson Waller backstage, noting his partner Austin Theory is at home injured tonight. Waller says he's going to win the MITB for the both of them. He's interrupted by Johnny Gargano calling him a fake friend\u2026 but they all get interrupted by the crash of a garage door opening. It's Drew McIntyre, with a beaten and bloodied CM Punk. Drew carries Punk over his shoulders into the arena where he drops him on the ramp. Drew steals a bracelet from Punk's wrist. Nick Aldis appears with security and Drew shoves him, with Nick shoving him back and words are exchanged. Drew just stares at the battered Punk as he slowly backs away. \n\n* After commercial, we see CM Punk getting placed in a neckbrace, on a gurney, and hauled off in an ambulance.\n\n* KO & Tonga Loa appear to affect the MITB Qualifying Match but only serve as a distraction as they take each other out.\n\n* We get a recap of the ending of Raw earlier this week where the Wyatt Sicks were unveiled. \n\n* LA Knight hits the ring, asking Logan Paul to get his goofy hair and US title down to the ring. He's said, he wants the championship, but Logan said no. He showed up at his house, and said no. He heard Logan was supposed to be in the ring tonight, but he no-showed Chicago. He doesn't want the triple threat match to qualify for MITB, but he'll beat him. Santos Escobar interrupts. Knight is mad, he asked for Logan Paul. Escobar says he must be delusional, chasing Paul like a desperate Chicago fanboy. But next week, he's dealing with Santos Escobar. Knight says he's looking past him, but Escobar interrupts him with a cheap shot. Knight turns the tables and says you can get beat up or you can get -- he's then hit from behind by Logan Paul!\n\n* As KO heads to the ring for his MITB qualifying match, he's attacked by the Tongans. However, he still makes his way to the match.\n\n* Michin is nursing her wounds backstage, and Tiffany Stratton shows up to offer her \"condolences.\" Michin says, at least she doesn't run to Nia Jax for protection. They spar for a moment before Nia shows up and takes out Michin. Tiffany laughs.\n\n* Next Friday, we have more MITB qualifier matches announced: Candice LaRae vs. Jade Cargill vs. Tiffany Stratton; Naomi vs. Blair Davenport vs. Indi Hartwell; and LA Knight vs. Logan Paul vs. Santos Escobar!\n\n* Kayla Braxton backstage addresses the CM Punk/Drew McIntyre situation, noting that Punk will be staying overnight at a local hospital for evaluation.\n\"\n* Paul Heyman says he's talked to everyone as he was told. But, per Roman Reigns, Solo is breaking commandments. He wasn't supposed to touch CM Punk, and he was only supposed to have Cody Rhodes in check so that when the Tribal Chief comes back\u2026 Solo interrupts him saying he hates to tell him this, but Roman isn't coming back. As Solo leaves for his match, Paul asks into the ether, \"how can that be?\"\n\n* The main event is nearly immediately crushed by interference. The Tongans, Kevin Owens & Randy Orton - with the Bloodline temporarily taken out. As Solo is cornered against the turnbuckle, he starts laughing maniacally, and from behind Jacob Fatu attacks! Fatu tosses Cody onto the announce table and leaps from the top rope to splash! Solo hugs him, and the Bloodline ends the night throwing up the 1s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Plugs**\n\n* Revisit the [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1dlh7jq/live_wwe_smackdown_on_fox_discussion_thread_june/)\n\n* Check out our [SquaredCircle Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/wredditofficial) for all sorts of AMA announcements and interaction!\n\n* Join our [SquaredCircle Discord](https://discord.gg/squaredcircle) for live chat!\n\n* Be sure to follow [@WWE on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wwe) and [Like WWE on Facebook!](http://www.facebook.com/wwe)\n\n* Like other wrestling promotions?

            "The fact that so many people expected the Wyatts to break up Cody's match but hardly anyone is disappointed because we finally got Jacob Fatu is just proof that WWE is firing on all cylinders.\n\n10/10 show.",

            "Pretty top-tier SD. I have to say I love Chelsea Green winning the qualifier, and I *really* hope they give it to her - it'd be the funniest possible thing. \n\nAlso love the fact people actually have *friends* now, unlike when they'd be getting jumped and nobody would help.",

            "I think this all leads to Solo getting in over his head. He\u2019s playing Tribal Chief, but he truly can\u2019t do it the way Roman did. He\u2019s gonna keep making rash decisions until it burns him, one way or another. Likely it\u2019s Roman that teaches him that lesson.",

            "I know it's been \"pile on AEW day\", though I will say one thing that's been missing for me from AEW for a lot of 2024 is a hot top storyline. I thought that storyline could have been The Elite vs. AEW storyline, but it feels like very quickly that storyline became just like any other one in AEW.\n\n1st, the main claim to fame that the new Elite had was that they took out Tony Khan, something that hadn't been done before in AEW. A great moment. But then just a month later, Tony is back on TV. So the heat they had from taking him out felt like it fizzled out. And the big part of the storyline too where the Elite had power when Tony wasn't at the shows is also gone. I feel like Tony needed to be gone a lot longer for this to work as well as it could have.\n\n2nd, it doesn't feel like there's as much urgency about this storyline as there could be now. And again, Tony's back now so why should there be. But I remember that promo Dax cut after DON where Team AEW lost and he's like \"Bryan & Darby will be back, and when they are we're coming after you\". Well, Bryan was back next week on Dynamite in an 8 Man Tag, and then immediately announced his participation in the Owen tournament. Which, don't get me wrong, that's awesome. But it just creates a disconnect when you hear Dax say that and Bryan just comes back to TV and, other than a mention, isn't doing anything about the Elite after going to war with them.\n\nAnd 3rd, and this isn't AEW's fault, the injuries. Losing Eddie in the 1st place sucked. But then losing Dax, who was going to be one of the main babyface focal points of this, hurt even worse.\n\nThe story is just at the point now where The Elite, the heels, are challenging a team of AEW to Blood & Guts to essentially prove themselves. Not a group of faces fighting back against them and challenging them to the match, but they laid out the challenge. I don't know, it just seems backwards. And any potential it felt like this story had as a top story just feels like it's gone now.",

Its way cooler when wrestlers have an arsenal of moves that can end the match, yeah there\u2019s their main finisher but that\u2019s not the only tool they have.\n\nThat leads in to a second peeve I have, when wrestlers do the shocked face like they\u2019ve just seen a cartel beheading after someone kicks out of a move they\u2019ve literally never won a match with. It didn\u2019t work the first 300 times, why are you gobsmacked it didn\u2019t work this time lol",
            "I think the Level Up show is featuring athletes from their NIL (next-in-line) program which recruits gifted collegiate amateur athletes, many of whom have fans who follow college sports. WIth the name changes, it's their way of signaling that \"Rex Brixton\" or \"Allysin Monroe\" are actually the college athlete with the unmarketable name you remember. (Although Thunder Keck would have ben a fine wrestling name.) If you're not following American college sports, I can see that it's not very useful.\n\nMy niche peeve is the tiny ladder in the ladder match. Every ladder included in a ladder match should allow the wrestlers to reach the item suspended above the ring. Any wrestler who grabs the tiny ladder is an idiot. (\"This tiny ladder won't help me win, but maybe I can use it in a spot that will get clipped on YouTube later...\")",

I dunno, almost like they're written by people who don't understand a good romance arc but feel like they just HAVE to have one sometimes.

Stardom has historically had a reputation of bringing in relatively unknown foreign wrestlers, getting them over with domestic fans, but foreign fans treating them with suspicion (just look at how long it took for Mariah May to get over!) She debuted in a faction with a couple of other foreign wrestlers at the time who were part-time fill-ins, but today Xena is mostly excellent in her role within Stardom.",

Him already being back has completely taken the wind & heat out of the angle/story.\n\nAnd yeah, the way they set up Blood & Guts with the heels making the challenge was dumb. It doesn't help that i'm bored of the yearly AEW booking trend of booking two groups of talents into a feud so they can do Anarchy in the Arena at DON & Blood & Guts a month or two later. \n\nI'd rather see the Bucks defend the tag titles, Okada have big singles matches as a serious top heel like Gunther & Jack Perry be properly built as a Dominik Mysterio-esque character but instead Jack hasn't done anything & Okada's a comedy character.",

Yes, some match placement is questionable, but you know out of their 9 match cards, 6/7 are going to be GREAT.\n\nThe issue is that on TV, these 6 matches end up all the same. They\u2019re all back and forth spot fests where everyone gets their shit in and even though the outcome isn\u2019t really in doubt, it has to be competitive. This means you end up seeing similar spots throughout the same show and it\u2019s annoying.\n\nTV wrestling actually benefits when people can tell the wrestler hierarchy. Your guys with belts should feel important and when they\u2019re showcased people are interested in it.\n\nThere\u2019s some weeks I think AEW does this well, and others they don\u2019t. They would rather give you a 2 hour wrestling show with a few segments and 6 great matches, but a tv audience needs a mix of some short matches, some segments, then a couple strong matches to hold them over",
            "If there's a new booker it doesn't have to be someone perfect cause TK has done okay and lowkey worse since his team was expanded to have TNA guys in it, but it *has* to be one of the guys that were stars in 00's ROH (Bryan, Joe etc.) They're the last ones to have been involved with a good, tight vision of wrestling that focuses on \"workrate\" without being an excuse for terrible stuntwork.\n\nI would like more tonal consistency and less dumb humor not in general but as a substitute for a personality. You can't have a show where the fans are screaming that the best parts are the characters that don't take themselves seriously. Like WWE has children's humor, AEW has humor for folks who still post template memes in facebook groups about Star Wars and the Good Place. \n\nDepush MJF, Ospreay, Jack Perry, the Young Bucks, Jericho, Malakai Black, Saraya \n\nPush Daniel Garcia, Hobbs, Takeshita, Strong, STP, Willow, the luchadors that aren't LB. \n\nI mean the push and depush stuff is wishful thinking that wouldn't resonate with a pretty sizeable part of the fanbase but I think they need to make the roster and their pecking orders a lot tighter than it has been. They've stretched themselves too much with this bloated roster and wins aren't valuable because even if on paper they have similar positions on the card, in praxis it's \"guy that we know has something going vs guy who definitely doesn't\".",

Not every champion rises to the title, but it's kind of refreshing to have some variety. Bad booking is bad booking, but they took a chance on someone who the domestic crowds were pulling for more strongly than I had seen them pull for a top contender in years.\n\nIt's probably the one major booking decision I think Okada got more or less not-wrong, even if Maika herself isn't in the sacred pantheon of great Stardom champions, at least not yet.",

There should be one world championship, one mid card championship, and one tag team championship, though keeping the 6 man tag belts to be different would be okay. It feels like damn near everyone you see on AEW TV has a belt, so they don't feel like valuable championships with auras.

And then Punk flew all the way to Scotland to an event he wasn't booked for, just to cost Drew the title again in a match that Drew had won fair and square. A match which Drew performed heroically in given that his wife only recently underwent emergency surgery.\n\nDrew quite reasonably sought revenge on Punk, and in doing so he doubtless inspired millions of men women and children who have suffered at the hands of a cowardly bully.\n\nWe should all aspire to be more like Drew. Hopefully once the Chicago natives have a chance to reflect in the cold light of day, they will realise how wrong they were to boo this modern day saint.",

            "This is why they still made well travelled indie veterans go to NXT",
            "It\u2019s his first night, I\u2019d cut him some slack.",
            "Jacob Fatu is a rookie at this level.  \n\nAll but **ONE** of his matches has been at what you might call \"Tier-3\" promotions, like MLW, Defy, GCW etc.\n\nHis lone \"Tier-2\" appearance was also his largest ever crowd he performed in front of, a 2,000 person show for NJPW Strong in a tag match.\n\nI'm not disparaging his wrestling skills, it's just a completely new game for him that'll im sure he'll get better at.\n\nJacob has never had to deal with a crowd of that size, commentary tables that intricate and tv production on that scale.  Literally Allstate arena has 8x as many people as his largest crowd.",
            "That looked painful",
            "Man you just know he\u2019s gonna be taking pins eventually lol",
            "Best 619 in the game!",
            "Well it\u2019s against Indy wrestlers. I mean people here were talking what a monster Matanza or Mil Muertes is and compared to all the luchadors and Indy wrestlers in lucha underground, they are. But Matanza would be like a smaller rhyno in wwe and mil muertes is shotter and lighter than John Cena.",
            "QUATTO wants you to OPEN YOUR MIND to the Bloodline",
            "Roman being the last to enter a War Games as a face.",
            "I can imagine some 97 War Games, Rock join forces with Roman and the Usos to take on the New Bloodline but then betrays Roman and along with the other members, they recreate the Ric Flair spot, Roman and the Usos get their head slammed with the cage door, writing them off until February.",
            "Joe Hendry lol",
            "Corbin",
            "Sami's syrian heritage in shambles.",
            "Nah, he'll join this Bloodline too.  5v5 at War Games.",
            "He's not coming back",
            "I think Hikuleo joins Solo and Roman reconciles with Cody, Jey, Jimmy, Sami... but wait there's the Rock too lol who knows",
            "Roman spologizing to the honorary uce will get a huge pop whwn the hug it out",
            "Jimmy is the key",
            "But that\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s not about Jey or even Sami going back to Roman. It\u2019s about those two agreeing to help Roman for the greater good. \n\nThey can easily make the new Bloodline be such a big problem that Jey and Sami team up with Roman. \n\nAlso, I could see the Wyatt Sicks being such a problem for Jey (and maybe Sami) that they ask Roman for their help with their problem.",
            "Haha I actually think they are cool animals but they are more dangerous than most think",
            "I think his presence as a performer is improving - just in my opinion he doesn\u2019t do it for me in the ring",
            "I think his character worked better in NXT I actually dig the loner street fighter, he doesn't have the aura and ambitions of a leader, so I hope he returns to that character after all this is over.",
            "The marks reveal themselves when Solo is involved. He's playing his part very well. We're not supposed to think he's a good replacement for Roman. We're supposed to think he's an ambitious former henchman who's way out of his depth and thinks he's bigger and badder than he really is. The less legitimate a replacement for Roman Solo appears to be, the bigger the pop will be when Roman returns.",
            "Folks only have one view of what a leader is for a stable lmfao.",
            "Lol it was? Who owns the name Ceasar?",
            "Thank you!",
            "BUT",

            "I thought birthwise he was a full brother to Tama, and a cousin to Loa? (Yes they are brothers, adopted siblngs are siblings, I'm talking about the coment on genetics.)",
            "There is also Sean Maluta and Lance Anoa\u2019i, both wrestles on the independents.\n\nBoth of them would be perfect to eat pins or get sneaky wins and be the first line of defense in The Bloodline. Afa Jr. aka Manu is still wrestling.",
            "There is also Thamiko Fatu (real name Jeremiah) but he's doing a lot less than the rest.. saw it mentioned he began wrestling in the last year or so?",
            "Zilla Fatu is too young and too green for the big league. he need to build his experience few years more before ready for WWE",
            "What's funny is that, if you've seen him in NJPW, he doesn't come across as scary at all. He just seems like a laid back giant dude",

            "Meh",
            "\"Look, we're bad and dangerous and even we don't want to fuck with this motherfucker, that's how bad this guy is\"",
            "Then Haku would remember he himself bit a guy's nose off before and be like Jacob's not so bad.",
            "I don't know I feel like the pedestal for this a crazy motherfucker stops at Haku lol",
            "Leave him alone he was stimming",
            "Totally. WWE is a whole ass TV production, it's a behemoth of moving parts.",
            "Exactly. \n\nIf Okada would have went to NXT he would have learned the basics of how to work a control board and not messed up like he did the other night. \n\n\n\n/s",
            "Yep.\n\nFatu's largest crowd was 2,000 people for NJPW Strong, which is also his ONLY Tier 2 promotion appearance, 99% of his prior experience was on Tier 3 promotions like MLW, Defy, Reality of Wrestling etc.\n\nHe's never performed at a proper NJPW, ROH, NXT, TNA, CMLL or AAA show (minus 3 promotion event that had AAA that was attended by almost no one)",
            "You should talk more about these tiers.",
            "Matanza was Jeff Cobb. That dude's on a different level than a lot of wrestlers.",
            "he just lost a shit ton of weight homie that\u2019s all",
            "And to start the reactor...",
            "Should be KO is the one booked, but they annihilate him before he can get into the cage and they go 3 vs 4.\n\nThen when the timer runs out the refs are confused and wonder if they should start war games.\n\nThen Romans music drops...",
            "Surprise returns for Wargames 2024\u00a0\n\n\n- Men's: Roman Reigns for storyline reasons\u00a0\n\n\n- Women's: Becky Lynch so we can say it happened 3x in a row now",
            "I think I just filled the cup",
            "Nah Joe Hendry is better off as the 6th Wyatt",
            "Roman, Jimmy, Jey, and who?\n\nEdit: Forgot about Sami but still not sure who the 5th member would be",
            "Rock will be the 5th of bloodline 2.0",
            "\"Sorry\" - Solo said calmly",
            "High Chief Rock only coming out for Mania season",
            "That will 100% turn KO heal again",
            "Cutting your teeth on the indies does more for you as an in ring performer than NXT.  NXT is great for making you a \"WWE Superstar\" but every top tier in-ring performer you can think of who wrestled in NXT didn't LEARN to wrestle in NXT.",
            "Frankly I\u2019m impressed with how well the Bloodline has been the top storyline or near the top all these years running. \n\nIt\u2019s all so good.",
            "I kinda see his role similar to the unhinged & bumbling siblings (Dodd & Gargano) in Fargo S2 & S4 when their families started to go into chaos",
            "If we're not supposed to take him seriously like with Roman that's fine with me as long as they don't give him the main event of summerslam against the biggest and most popular babyface they have in Cody, let him send Jacob to do the dirty job and be his world champion, that Solo has Vince's position in the corporation and Jacob the Rock as the crown jewel of the group.",
            "Brutus.  He stabbed Julius in the back to get it.",
            "It's not about the \"Caesar\" name itself...it's about trademarking the full name 'Caesar Sikoa\". This way it belongs to the WWE and they can use it freely, while stopping others from using it for profit or any gain. It's pretty common practice.",
            "IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY",
            "Yes",
            "Sammartino Jr",
            "Okay you are right I misread Hikuleo\u2019s Wikipedia page. I also didn\u2019t mean to imply that that half brothers aren\u2019t real brothers",
            "I can see a timeline where this goes full Attitude Era and Manu is revealed as the brains behind the bloodline for Legacy reasons",
            "Well there are like 50 Samoans I was just talking about the major people I can see joining",
            "Sean was in NXT for a while right? He can fit back right in.",

            "Hikuleo is the little brother of the Tongans\n\nBut he's always had a gentle giant vibe even as part of BC",
            "Graves was trying to get that point across on commentary, Jacob being the one family member who scares everyone else. So having both Tama and Tanga looking a bit off put was gold.",
            "Hey man he said he was sorry",
            "Okada performed at a national Tier-1 promotion for years.\n\nAll but ONE of Fatu's matches have been with Tier-3 indies like GCW, ROW, Defy, MLW etc.\n\nHis lone outlier is a single NJPW Strong appearance with 2,000 fans attending.",
            "Well yeah, he\u2019s shredded now. Doesn\u2019t change that he\u2019s same height as solo and now looks about same weight",
            "Yeah i was thinking that, it would be fucking amazing for him to not be announced for the match somehow and be a surprise and was wondering how to do it without it being super obvious.",

He joins back up with his brothers and you for the OG bloodline against Jacob and the 3 Tongan brothers\n\nSolo already looks like a #2 compared to Jacob. He\u2019ll slide back into the OG BL and Jacob vs Roman is the next big feud in the civil war",
            "While I think The Rock will be revealed to be behind this iteration of The Bloodline, I'll be very surprised if he's participating in a WarGames match.  He might even be in the middle of shooting Moana at that point.  I don't expect him to do a match again until Mania.",
