            "Best part, it can be reused. For real, the tech behind recycling nuclear waste into useable nuclear energy is old the problem with doing it is of course politics.",
            "You should see what 20 years of coal slag, ash, carbon dioxide, and various toxic chemicals look like.\n\nOh, you can't, because instead of being stuck in some nice concrete barrels, they're in your lungs and your water and your land, giving you cancer and literally killing well over a million people a year.\n\nIt's utterly insanity to think that a few barrels worth of completely contained toxic waste is a problem, but dumping billions of tons of toxic chemicals into our environment is fine, because hey, it's not a problem you have to deal with anymore.",
            "And yet some people throw an absolute hissy fit when you actually show them that the \u201cwaste\u201d from nuclear is next to nothing when looking at other alternatives.\n\nThe waste is also not even fully depleted, It\u2019s still good for another few thousand years, so the possibilities are endless.\n\nIt\u2019s also a lot safer than some people seem to believe. Safety has come along way, and the chances of another Chernobyl happening is close to 0, unless something absolutely catastrophic happens.",
            "It's a good thing they're storing it and not dumping it in the seas.",

            "Right? Nuclear waste is not the giant issue we made it out to be in the 80s. I'll take that any day over a coal or natural gas plant and their CO2 emissions.",
            "Anyone have a pic of what 20 years of coal ash would be in comparison besides  OMFG huge?",
            "Keep in mind, the US only needs 80 nuclear power plants the size of the Bruce Power Station in Canada in order to provide almost 100% of her electrical needs. If we increase the plant size to that of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Japan, the largest nuclear plant ever built, we would only need 60.",

            "It looks so harmless. And yeah, it looks so much better compared to probably millions of tons of CO2 that a coal plant would have emitted for the same electrical energy output. However, for how many years will these wastes have to be stored? And every how many years will it be required to renew the casing?",

            "My favorite Kyle Hill video is the one where he visits a power plant and kisses one of those containers to prove they are very safe.",
            "This one drives me MAD! I'm not saying Nuclear is some magic cure for cheap energy, or that it'll solve all our electricity problems, but the fear over the \"nuclear waste\" is ridiculous. Up until a few years ago I assumed they were producing these massive quantities of waste that had no-where to go. The entire world's output of nuclear waste could fit in a Walmart parking lot. How fear campaigns like this work is beyond me.\n\nI'm not saying you can't have arguments against Nuclear power--but waste ain't it.",
            "Well, we could use it in a thorium salt reactor, but the left won't approve atomic reactors.  Or, it could be buried in the NV desert under Yucca Mountain, but for Harry Reid, another Democrat,  who blocked the project.",
            "This is comically small",
            "Whats crazy is that every nuclear power plant in the country has an area like this on site where they store spent fuel. They can\u2019t be moved offsite because of the liability with transporting these casks at such a high radiation level inside so they\u2019ll pretty much be in the same spot indefinitely. I\u2019ve seen spent fuel areas at plants with twice as many casks as these. Palo Verde Nuclear Plant is the biggest energy generating plant in the US and they have a shit ton of these on site.",

            "People who think this is some sort of catastrophe are idiots. Nuclear power is the cleanest power source we currently have and it's really not that much waste.",
            "[I got this off of Google Maps](https://imgur.com/a/ag8AeQz)\n\nThis is Waterford 3 Nuclear Generating Station in Killona, Louisiana. It has been operating since 1985. I have circled the spent fuel it has generated since then. I have put a circle of the same size in the parking lot to give a sense of how much spent fuel a nuclear plant produces in 40 years of operation.",
            "I rarely comment on reddit and I never did here, but I want to add another perspective I haven't read here before: \n\nI studied energy systems and their applications in Germany, which as you may know, turned of its last nuclear reactor recently. I myself think it was a wrong decision, especially since we still use coal, but it was written into law a few governments ago. \n\nBut the fact is, even though nuclear is better than many fossil fueled enery sources, it is not even remotely as efficient and cheap as most renewables. The price per kWh is just to expensive to find investors and a large, decentralized network of solar panels, wind turbines and so on, is not only cheaper but solves other problems, like distribution or the way electricity is priced on the european market. \n\nAnd lastly, even the small amount of nuclear waste is a problem since noone except for finnland succeded in finding a permanent storage solution for waste that is deadly for timeperiods longer than any recorded human civilisation lasted. The whole \" we can use the waste again, we just have to find out how\", is, for me, the same empty promise fusion is giving is for half a century. \n\nThanks for reading if anyone bothers \n\nPS: I am open to discuss about what i said. It is a diverse and constanly changing field of engineering and i like to educate or be educated.",
            "Smallest footprint, most power, zero carbon emissions. Nuclear power has always been the path forward. The continued burning of fossils, especially coal is more damaging than a million Chernobyls. Plus, we ain\u2019t the Soviets.",

            "Compare that to the garbage produced over that same span of all the houses powered by the plant and you'll see waste/storage should be a concern but not as big as it is.

            "To put it into perspective these alone are 542 tons of nuclear waste, produced by only one nuclear reactor in 20 years. In war this would be a nice target you only have to throw one bomb on it and the whole area gets decontaminated. And now think about how this would look like in 100 years and if every country starts relying only on nuclear power. I think it\u2019s clear that we should focus on safer ways to produce energy.",

It's certainly not a valid reason to oppose nuclear power.\n\nTransporting nuclear waste to a centralized location is a stupid idea and always was. That's infinitely more dangerous than storing it on site.\n\nWith proper regulations, nuclear waste can be stored on site indefinitely.",
            "What people don't realise is that the vast majority of nuclear waste is not spent fuel (high radiation). It's low radiation waste like : gloves, clothing, tools and other day to day things that has been handling radiated stuff. You won't die handling those things but they still need to be dealt with.",

Nuclear power is cheap and efficient.  Nuclear power plant technology has moved forward to minimize waste as well.  Much of what this 30 year old plant stores as waste would have been recycled.",
            "So I used to make these casks for them... It is about 3 feet of boronated concrete then a steel shell that is 2-3 inches thick, you can see the vents in the top and bottom to cool the fuel through the air gap between the steel and a 1 inch stainless steel can that holds the fuel bundles. Pretty neat stuff really.",
            "It looks like fuel assemblies which are basically bundles of the fuel rods. It would look much like it does when they are loaded because the actual uranium oxide pellets are contained within the rods as they are \"burned\" as fuel. There may be some slight deformation but it will look the same coming out as it did going in",
            "Nuclear fuel is uranium powder packed into solid little pellets then put in rods which is then used to produce energy. By the time the fuel is \"spent,\" it is upwards of 96% uranium. It's still a solid in the same shape it was before.\n\nIt stops being used in the reactor because 4% is turned into other elements like plutonium which drastically reduces the amount of output. Its either enriched again to be reused, or more likely in the states to be stored for hundreds of millions of years until it is no longer radioactive.",
            "A long stainless steel bundle. Multiple stainless steel tubes called pencils maybe 18-21 of them not much bigger in diameter welded together into a cylinder about 14\u201d long.

            "People really like to blame stigma and public opinion for a lack of nuclear in this country. When ever did power companies care about public opinion? \n\nThe real barrier is investor owned utilities.

            "It's quite the opposite. Nuclear will continue to play a niche role and fall by the wayside quickly as renewables and battery storage continue to rapidly improve.\n\n1. The highest rate of expansion nuclear ever had was 20 GW/year in the 1980s, which was twice what it is now. Renewables are currently adding 250 GW/year. That's about as much new capacity per year as nuclear power exists *in total*.   \nThere is no feasible path by which the nuclear supplier industry can get even close to the figures of renewables by 2050, since nuclear suppliers struggle with rising steel prices, a highly educated workforce that can't be grown quickly, and global fuel supply insecurities.\n\n2. The extreme lead times of 15-20 years (planning + construction time) and massive up-front capital and carbon costs make nuclear a very unattractive investment both from an economic and a climate change perspective.  \nFrom the beginning of the planning phase, it can take 50+ years for a nuclear reactor to repay its monetary value and 30+ years to make up for its initial carbon cost (and these numbers only get worse as more renewables are introduced), which is simply too slow.  \nRenewables can be planned, built, and pay off their financial and carbon investment before a nuclear power plant has even finished construction.\n\nSouth Korea provides a good example for the difficulty to scale nuclear:\n\n1. They committed to a long-term plan to hit 60% nuclear by 2030\n\n2. They reached 30% after a *decades* long effort, realised that it won't work out, and are now on the path to match this hard fought 30% nuclear capacity with renewables in just 10 years (2020-2030).\n\nAt this moment, the only country that builds significant amounts of nuclear power is China... and it's a feeble 5% of their power generation. The only reason they're a big player in it is because they're expanding their total capacity faster than any other country in history, so they're tapping into all available supplier industries at once. The result of it is a miniscule fraction of nuclear.\n\nMeanwhile renewables and battery storages continue to improve at a rapid pace. Battery storages are becoming commercially viable in more and more grids, so we are now for the first time seeing their expansion into true grid-scale storages.\n\nThe electricity goal for most countries will be to hit an annual average of 90% wind+solar backed up by 10% gas/biomass in the 2040s-50s.

Well, we do, but we don't. The law says we have to use a specific place (Yucca Mountain), but Nevada said \"nah\" for a long time, and were able to primarily because of Harry Reid. There's another site, better than Yucca Mountain, that's equipped to take it and the state they're in is fine with it called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. They could literally accept spent fuel Monday (next business day) if it were legal, as they keep all the equipment and trained personnel just in case. The law says Yucca, though, and you know how well Congress works, so don't expect that law to change any time soon.  \n\nOne more fun fact:  We (US taxpayers) pay for the storage in the photo! You'd think it would be the power plant, but we promised them we'd have a place for them to throw it away whenever we gave them permits to build.

            "\"Breeding\" is a poor name for fast neutron reactors that sticked.\n\nThere is a way to make nuclear reactor that run on spent fuel of current one and depleted uranium, produce very little wastes of its own and is intrinsically more safe than PWR/BWR designs.\n\nI prefer the name \"plutonium cyclce\" because it better describes the process. \n\nSo-called \"Fast neutron\" is a netron that is released when U235 atom is split. \"Fast\" is also a wrong name - its more like \"neutron with higher energy\".\n\nIn PWR/BWR reactor designs (also known as \"thermal neutron reactor\") most of power comes form splitting u235. \"Thermal neutron\" is a slowed down neutron. Basically you have u235 releasing neutron which is then slowed down by water, which then splits u235 atoms. Thermal neutron have high chance of splitting u235 atom and very low chance of interacting with U238 (depleted uranium) or plutonium.\n\nPlutonium is created when neutron emitted by fission of u235 \"joins\" u238, and after a while it transforms into Pu atom. Pu need another such neutron to split, however there is a big chance that it will absorb neutron and transform into other Pu atom which is less likely to split.\n\nIn fast neutron reactors you don't have slowed down (thermal) neutrons. You have just fast neutrons. They transform U238 atoms (depleted uranium) into Plutonium, and cause Plutonium to split. If Plutonium absorbs neutron instead of splitting, its not a problem because eventually it will be split as well, because there are a lot of fast neutrons in the reactor core.\n\nAnd this is not some theoretical work.\n\nThere are full scale commercial plants in existence that utilize this technology.\n\nRecently Rosatom powered such reactor by fuel that was made exclusively from depleted uranium and spent fuel of their PWR reactor. It is called \"closing the fuel cycle\" because with such technology the only spent fuel is true spent fuel - a few % of fuel loaded in reactor.",

But they kept coming around and complaining about us building on their property. The cops ignored their phone calls, we even got our British neighbors to come help us beat them up a few times. They started bringing their grandkids when they got too old. But they never stopped coming around. Eventually we finished building whatever it was we thought they needed, gave them back their property with much poorer version of their grandmothers house, told them you\u2019re welcome and went home empty handed.",

            "\u201cAn ancient Egyptian vase in the shape of the deity Bes showed traces of chemical plant compounds known to produce hallucinations, according to a recent preprint posted to Research Square. The authors suggest that members of the cult of Bes may have consumed a special cocktail containing the compounds to induce altered states of consciousness.\u201d\n\nThis plant is called Syrian Rue and contains MAOi inhibitors, which act similarly to the Ayahuasca vine in Amazonian Shamanism. When we take into consideration that Egyptians also had a sacred 'Tree of Life' that is suggested to be Acacia, a tree containing higher levels of DMT, it seems possible that the ancient alchemists of Egypt mixed Acacia with Syrian Rue to create the Middle Eastern version of Ayahuasca, used by priests and pharaohs to connect with the gods. Maybe that explains why so many DMT reports speak of ancient Egyptian motifs or deity encounters.\n\nOn the left side of the 'Tree of Life' hieroglyphics in the tomb of Pharaoh Ramzes II, we can see the God Thoth, the father of Alchemy, scribe of the gods and the teacher of humanity. The Egyptian Tree of Life was the home of the Bennu Bird (Phoenix) and was believed to represent the soul of the Sun God Ra and symbolized resurrection and the rising sun.",
