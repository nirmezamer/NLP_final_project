So as she's sitting at the bar drinking, when she notices this couple across the bar signing asl to each other. Knowing a little sign language herself and already having drank, she goes to introduce herself. They were so happy to be able to talk with someone else, they invited her to sit with them and keep drinking.\n\nWho knows how many drinks later, the topic of ditching the bar and \"heading home\" comes up, but she gets nervous. She's trans, amab, snd doesn't know the sign for that. So she tries to explain \"above waist girl, below waist boy\", and they look at her for a second, confused, before the guy (and I'm only saying this in text for demonstration purposes when irl she'd just sign the word) *holds up two fingers on each hand while closing the others, then puts them a sideways 69 shape and bumps his hands together rapidly*. ^(The sign for intercourse, but done excitedly lol.)\n\nIn more ways than one, they never heard her coming that night!",
