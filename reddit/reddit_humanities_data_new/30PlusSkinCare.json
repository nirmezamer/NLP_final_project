Occasionally I\u2019ll see someone who does and think oh hey someone like me\u2026 do most women shave or wax their peach fuzz? (I know this isn\u2019t considered beard hair) ",

            "I have super similar fuzz. I cycle between dermaplaning it and embracing it. Flamingo makes a really nice dermaplaning razor with very affordable refills if you decide to go that route.\n\nBut I once read that Herb Ritz, who frequently photographed Marilyn Monroe, said he loved her peach fuzz because it gave her an ethereal glow (or something similarly poetic) and I kinda think that\u2019s awesome\n\nEdit: someone astutely pointed out that the photog was likely not Herb Ritz and they are probably right. May have been Richard Avedon.",
            "This is only my opinion but I feel like dermaplaning started off as a way to improve skin texture and remove vellus hair (peach fuzz) so makeup is easier to apply, but it's evolved to the point where it's made a lot of women feel pressure to have no vellus hair at all. \n\nVellus hair is normal and I haven't run into any kind of measuring stick that determines how much peach fuzz is too much. If it is causing you woe, you have options, including dermaplaning.",
            "I have always had way more than most people too, but I read something the other day saying there was a positive correlation with vellus hairs and skin elasticity and negative relationship with skin sagging severity. Made me think I should maybe stop hating it so much \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823501/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20vellus%20hair,elastic%20recovery%20to%20total%20deformation).",
            "I think \u201cnormal\u201d varies, really! If I saw you I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it or even really notice it \u2014 but I don\u2019t think my face has quite as much fuzz. BUT I do have a few longer and much darker hairs than you on my chin that I often pluck. \nIf I were in your shoes I\u2019d probably remove it just to help my makeup application, but it\u2019s all about what you feel comfortable with!",
            "I have a similar amount of peach fuzz as you do. I leave mine because it seems like a pretty trivial thing to spend effort on maintaining (along with so many other things!). I feel like it shows up more in pictures like this than in person so I don\u2019t stress about it too much. I say just try not to look at it as we are our own harsh critics. I doubt anyone else in your normal life notices like you do. I wasn\u2019t going to comment but I saw everyone saying to shave it off and was surprised there weren\u2019t at least a few abstainers! All of this being said, I do have a gnarly stache that I trim with a dermaplane tool and it does cause irritation/occasional break outs (I don\u2019t break out much at all) so do be careful if you\u2019re prone.",
            "I just shave mine like once a month. It doesn't grow back any thicker or darker or anything. I just use my regular razor and shave oil. It's been working for men for ages. \n\nI have tried waxing and other methods in the past but shaving is the only one that doesn't give me any irritation or breakouts.",
            "I have lots of light peach fuzz. I leave it alone. I refuse to start some other cosmetic thing I gotta keep up with ha",
            "I'm 42 and started noticing that mine was looking thicker. I wondered if I was imagining things, and then I did a little reading and found out that as we age our vellus hair DOES in fact get thicker due to hormonal changes! LUCKY US! And some vellus hair can even become terminal hair as we approach menopause. I started using those little beauty razors to shave mine off, but honestly, it just caused it to grow back with blunted ends and wonky, which made it more noticeable to me and made me feel even worse about it. I'm at the point where I'm just like, fuck it. I don't care anymore. But I also don't wear makeup, and foundation and powder definitely makes it more noticeable. Anyway, I just came here to say you're perfectly normal. If you decide to start using the razors or dermaplaning, be prepared to keep at it if you don't want to deal with pokey, blunted vellus hair.\n\nEdited to add that all of these people saying \"hairier than most\" are probably just younger and haven't experienced this yet. THEIR TIME WILL COME!!!!",
            "I think its a little more than average, personally I would dermaplane it. I use the tinkle razors you can get for cheap on amazon. Makes your makeup look way better too!",
            "I have it and I just leave it. If someone can see it, they are way too damn close to me",
            "I\u2019ve looked at a lot of peoples faces up close and don\u2019t think this is abnormal, but abrupt changes can signal hormone changes",
            "I have the same amount as you, I'd say. Mine is also white blonde (as is the hair on my head, my eyelashes & eyebrows, which I tint) and it really only shows up if I zoom in on a photo where I'm backlit. I just leave it, and literally no one has ever commented on it. I've talked about it with friends and my husband, and everyone was like \"what hair??\" Social media and the time we spend staring at faces (ours and others) in photos can kind of warp reality sometimes!\n\n(As an aside, a few of these comments - luckily the downvoted ones - are *not* passing the vibe check - there are many women of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds whose body hair presents differently. Plus, while I am assuming that you are asking specifically about women who are assigned female at birth, trans women and non-binary folks have a different experience than me, a cis woman. So yeah, \"normal\" is super relative.)\n\nAll to say: do whatever makes you most comfortable! All faces - fuzzy or smooth - are good faces! \ud83d\udc95",
            "I do permanent hair removal for a living and I can safely say that \"normal\" (short peach fuzz, no troublesome hairs) is rarer than we think. Many women shave their faces and keep it secret. \nIf you don't like the way that it grows, shaving is probably your best option for now. Using a gentle face cleanser (Cetaphil, fragrance-free is my fave) as a shave gel, and a man's razor or the twinkle razor will be your best bet. Judging from how your hair looks, I think you'd only have to shave once every couple of weeks. You may find later on with age that some of those hairs may begin to thicken. If that happens, electrolysis is a good way to go for those",
            "If this is something you\u2019ve noticed recently you should consider seeing a doctor. You could be entering perimenopause, it could also be PCOS, or other hormonal changes that are causing your fur to be more prominent. \n\nI\u2019ve always been a little fuzzy myself but I noticed that entering into my late 30s I started getting furrier around my face. I got checked out, no PCOS thankfully but I\u2019m at the age of perimenopause so, stuff\u2019s just changing.",
            "i think you have an \"above average\" peach fuzz, yes, but i don't see this as something to be fixed. i wouldn't do anything about it if i were you. it's just a normal part of your body",

I now dermaplane my whole face, from my under-brows to sideburns! Worst thing I ever did lol. I think peach fuzz is cute, especially since it is blonde, it keeps a woman\u2019s face soft, now mine is sometimes prickly, which I hate. You\u2019re gorgeous so don\u2019t try to change yourself or do something you would regret like I did. One love \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I remember I had a classmate who I sat next to, and I liked watching her facial peach hair make her face glow when sun rays would pass through these little hairlings. I was kinda jealous \ud83d\ude2d I practically don\u2019t have any facial hair except for a few black thick moustache hair. But this peachy hair is so cute! I wish I had some so I could gently rub it with my fingertips. \u2728",

            "Please please don\u2019t let all these comments on dermaplaning make you think you should or have to do it. Your hair is super normal and dermaplaning can do significant damage to your skin barrier, make you break out, etc. speaking from experience",
            "Looks a bit more than \"average\" to me but sitll very much in \"normal\" category. I probably wouldn't notice it or, if I did, would not think twice about it. If you don't like it - you can always shave it. It will not grow back thicker or darker.\n\nI think peach fuzz can be less or more visible depending on  makeup - if you have just cream/fluid foundation it's less visible, if you use loose powder - much more.",
            "You are quite fuzzy but I wouldn\u2019t notice it if you weren\u2019t pointing it out to me. I wouldn\u2019t stress about it too much!",

I have a spray sunscreen mist I use sometimes and it attaches to the hair in such a way that makes me look like Chewbacca \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve never dermaplaned because I\u2019m too scared it\u2019ll come back weird but you are not alone in the peach fuzz department. I\u2019m positive no one notices but we are hard on ourselves around these parts \ud83e\udd72",

            "I have hair like that. \nI did electrolysis for YEARS. \nThought I was on top of it. \nThen menopause came and I was back to lots of facial hair. Very fine. Blonde. Lots of it. \nI just shave once a week.",
            "Well I have tried many methods. I used to wax my peach fuzz off (once a month) but it\u2019s painful, not for the faint of heart. So I stopped that a couple years ago. \n\nSo now I will do one of two things: 1) shave it off with a dermaplane razor if I want the extra exfoliation (which is usually every 2 weeks) and 2) use the Finishing Touch Flawless shaver every few days, or when I start to notice it come back. \n\nPeach fuzz is totally normal, but for me personally-I hate how it makes my makeup look, especially because I like powder formulas. So I choose to shave it, but if you want to keep it that\u2019s cool too, do whatever makes you comfortable and happy :)\n\nEdit: ohhhh, I forgot, sometimes\u2026.I will use a regular razor and shaving cream like a man would if my face is feeling extra sensitive. I don\u2019t get any irritation from that vs. the dermaplane. I wonder if using a cream, and the dermaplane, would work. Hmmm\u2026\nAnd before anyone asks, no, my hair has never grown back in thicker or darker and I\u2019ve been removing the hair in my face is various ways for over a decade.",
            "I have had it all my life.  My grandmother was raised in France and told me all French women shave their faces, so I started twenty years ago and it was a game changer.  And it grows back as peach fuzz.  Growing back thicker is a myth.",

            "I am a hairy beast. I do love dermaplaning.",

            "If it bothers you , dermaplane it, but honestly it\u2019s not bad at all. Mine is similar to yours but goes a bit darker toward my ear, so I dermaplane it, but only like once every month or so. Make sure you dermaplane downward . Not against the grain like when you shave legs, shave opposite. X",
            "I'd say you are on the hairy side. So am I but totally normal. Hairy can be normal.",
            "Some women have little to no visible peach fuzz, and others have darker more visible hair. Some shave it, some leave it. The entire spectrum exists. It's a choose your own adventure. \n\nI used to dermaplane my face once in a while, and while it did remove the peach fuzz I had, it would irritate my skin. Also, it just grows back. I stopped doing it (along with wearing makeup, doing my nails, and quite a few other things)...and I'm so much happier. \n\nI used to treat the maintenance of my appearance like something I was getting paid to upkeep - like a full-time job. The benefits were terrible. Haha. Most people are too focused on themselves to care about what you're doing and how you look. In the end, being kind (to others AND myself) was the prettiest thing I learned to do.",
            "Leave your hair fuzz alone, if you remove it, it will grow back thickerdarker and coarser.Your the only person who notices it anyway, So leave it alone xx",
            "Normal! It\u2019s cute! Don\u2019t stress.",
            "You do have a bit more fuzz than the average person.  If you're looking for a removal method, I suggest you get those little face shavers. I use them to remove my mustache. I do it on a wet face with a bit of moisturizer, and I don't get irritated after.",
            "Elizabeth Taylor apparently shaved her face every day so she would look better on camera and so foundation would look smoother.  That was in the days before computers could correct any little blemish on film.  \n\nI run a disposable pink razor over my entire face several days each week.   It does get rid of the fuzz and it also takes off some skin cells.  If you do it once look at the razor after each pass to see what the razor has removed.",
            "I think if you wear foundation it makes it easier if you dermaplaine it either professionally or the have little kits at Walmart. If it doesn\u2019t bother you then leave it. A lot of people don\u2019t even shave their armpits anymore Lol.",
            "I think women seem to create acne prone and sensitive skin by taking theirs off . Personally I think it\u2019s lovely and makes you look soft and feminine",
            "i think you might have slightly more than normal but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. the lighting/proximity to the camera is just accentuating it in these pictures. \n\ni don\u2019t have much peach fuzz on my face, but i do have more hair on my arms than other women which is also a similar white blonde. sometimes i notice it, but in most lighting and from normal distances it\u2019s pretty much invisible. i think it\u2019s probably the same for you. you\u2019re a human being, you don\u2019t need to be completely hairless!",
            "Most women have this. Some get rid of it, some don't. I don't mind it or do anything about it unless some of the hair is very dark.",
            "I remove mine because it\u2019s dark, but FYI while scrolling I just stopped to admire your peach fuzz. So yes everyone is removing it, but I like yours! It looks like soft like an actual peach.",
            "People saying they don't have this... we're mammals and covered in hair! Its totally normal. People saying yours is more than \"average\" also aren't getting you've angled this photos in the light to highlight it. \n\nI think the 5% you're noticing are just the 5% in the right light to catch it. On this sub an above avg amount of people might remove it but I don't know anyone IRL who does.",
            "I find this really cute and attractive tbh",
            "This is more hair than the average woman. \n\nIf you wanted to remove it, I would probably have it threaded.",
            "To be completely honest, I think you probably have more peach fuzz than average. It makes me wonder if there is potentially a hormonal component to it.",
            "You do have more than many people but I think it's cute.\nIf you want to try dermaplanning I HIGHLY recommand Shiseido razors. They're cheap and AMAZING. Nothing else compares.\n\nAnd no, most women do not shave their faces I feel. Maybe pluck darker hair or wax a mustache but that's about it?",
            "I finally bought one of the little electric face shaving things for this at ulta. It was like $20-$30 and it helps a lot! But I forget to do it like half the time.",
            "I mean this seems excessive to me but then again I haven\u2019t looked intently to most faces to notices this. This might have a bit to do with age or hormonal status .",

            "I have tons more fuzz than you and I remove it",
            "I think you don't have an abnormal amount of peach fuzz. It's very normal to have. If you want to remove it, I would suggest an eyebrow razor like the tinkle brand on Amazon. \nI have PCOS, so I have a lot more darker and coarser hairs than you, so I shave with a 4 blade razor and shaving cream. I like the Flamingo brand razors. They don't irritate my sensitive skin. I also like the Amazon basics unscented shaving cream. Whatever shaving cream you choose, make sure it's fragrance free because it can be very irritating to your skin with shaving and all. It's like rubbing salt in a wound.",
            "I shave my face at least once per week and have for years. It\u2019s a myth that it causes hair to come in courser and darker in women.  It\u2019s a game changer.  Exfoliates and gets rid of the peach fuzz.",
            "I don\u2019t have any. But I consider it normal, and probably would just leave it alone if I had it lol",
            "It varies but this does seem on the slightly higher than avg side (which is totally fine!!)\n\nDo you by any chance have a hormone imbalance?\n\nNone of my business but I have one and facial hair can be (or can not be) a sign.\n\nEither way - everyone has hair on their face and I know MANY women (including myself) who dermaplane.\n\nI do it cause I prefer how my makeup looks with it like that",
            "I remove it and I think lots of women acrually remove their peach fuzz",
            "i shave mine about once a month as a treat because it feels so soft after. but i don\u2019t really care when it grows back, & i have to baby my skin after.  \ni also suggest getting your hormones checked out if this is more fuzz than usual.",
            "Judging by your enviable eyebrows, yes you might have good hair and could trim the fuzz if you\u2019re big into makeup.",
            "I feel like this might depend on your ethnicity. I personally don't have this but I notice it on other women.",
            "Looks fine to me. I don\u2019t personally have much peach fuzz so it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever given much thought to, but I don\u2019t think it looks bad on you at all.",
            "Ive wondered the same.  I have it as well.",
            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s abnormal - because what\u2019s normal anyway? I\u2019ve seen more and less, I think it\u2019s very individual. You shouldn\u2019t feel self conscious about or feel pressure to remove it. That said, I remove mine at home once in a while because I love how smooth my skin becomes and I feel like it\u2019s much easier for any products to penetrate the skin.",
            "Your hair is blonde, you really shouldn't feel insecure about it.  Keep in mind, hair on your face for women is mostly genetic but if it fluctuates it can be hormonal as well.   If you are happy with your weight, happy with how you feel, then don't worry about it.  You really don't have a lot.  Plus once you get older it definitely decreases...  \n\nI'm a brunette, so waxing my peach fuzz on my moustache was a definite yes when I was younger.   If it bothers you, get rid of it.   But do it for you.",

It hasn\u2019t ever bothered me too much, but a few months ago I started shaving my face (about once a week) and I\u2019m really kicking myself for not doing it sooner. It helps a lot with makeup application and my skin just feels so smooth and nice. I was worried it would cause acne flares or grow back too prickly feeling, but it\u2019s been totally fine. I still pluck my mustache area though. That does grow back too quickly and a bit too prickly for my liking.",
            "Its normal to have  varying degrees of peach fuzz per person although the only time it is a biggie is if you\u2019re anorexic which you seem healthy so unless you\u2019re not getting enough nutrients in nah homie. Embrace the fuzz, its lovely and its part of you.",

If you\u2019re happy to embrace them go for it why not, if you want to switch it up  professional dermaplaning is great once a month. Essentially a skin technician will use a surgical blade to lightly exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells and vellus hairs then apply a hydrating serum/moisturiser. Although like others have commented you can also buy similar at home blades yourself, they will be a little more blunt as they are not surgical but will still give the result of removing peach fuzz. If you choose to use the at home version, please make sure you use a serum or something like Vaseline to help the blade glide over and prevent micro cuts! :)",

            "It's normal and I don't care to remove mine, reason being, I see people who dermaplane, once they start they have to upkeep doing it every couple of days or some, every day depending on their skin type and fuzz level. If they skip doing that, some develop the 5 o'clock shadow (if one has darker tone) so it's important to be religious about it and I got no time for this. \n\nThe downside of not removing the fuzz is your makeup will never look as flawless as those who do. I'm not a makeup junkie I only ever wear foundation to even out skin tone and for blue light protection and nothing else so it's not a priority to look flawless. And my current routine is already taking so much time that I don't really have ha ha. \n\nSo I guess it depends on what you feel important for you. If you value looking perfect and flawless then yes, you should remove the fuzz.",

That hair is there to help regulate our body temp and protect our fragile face skin, and removing it constantly can actually negatively impact your skin\u2019s elasticity and cause clogged pores if not cleaned properly because sweat doesn\u2019t have anything to hold onto, taking longer to evaporate. So consider yourself lucky! You\u2019ve got a good solid amount of protection nothing abnormal.",

            "Tbh, the hair itself is likely the culprit as to why your skin is \u201creally breakout prone\u201d. That was the case for me before I started dermaplaning regularly. It makes sense because pores are the opening of a hair follicle so anything on your face (makeup, moisturizer, sunscreen, natural oil) is coating the hair & sitting on your skin. Making it more prone to clogging the pore which leads to pimples. Every so often I\u2019ll notice a small blemish or two when I\u2019ve gone too long between dermaplane sessions. But I guarantee you will see a drastic improvement in breakouts & overall skin quality if you dermaplane!! Try the tinkle razors on Amazon & watch a dermatologist tutorial on YouTube. You got this :)",
            "It could go both ways really. If you don't ever exfoliate at all, you might get some initial irritation from clogged pores. If you do some exfoliation a few weeks before you do the dermaplaning, you'll have less chance of irritating.\nI actually do what someone else suggested, I just use one of those mini eyebrow/nose trimmers and just use that to get rid of peach fuzz. My skin has moods \ud83d\ude05",
            "I\u2019m also very break out prone and dermaplaning doesn\u2019t cause break outs for me. In fact it seems to make me break out less! I think sweat or oil or something collects around the little fine hairs and causes blemishes. \n\nIf you do try it, just make sure not to use any harsh products the day before or day after. You can also watch YouTube videos on how to do it correctly so you don\u2019t irritate your skin by dragging the blade  across it. Use a fresh blade every time.",

It went up and down, was usually worse in the evenings.\n\nAre the lymph nodes in your neck swollen at all? Have you felt oddly warm/sweaty or faintly ill since you noticed this? When I've had tooth infections cooking, I never had a real fever, but I'd notice I would kick off blankets and get warm at night when I usually run cold.\n\nI'm so glad you're getting in w the dentist! It could definitely be something else - I know really bad TMJ can present as face swelling - but bad teeth are no joke. Recently had to have a new root canal done because an oversized crown from years back threw off my bite and ended up killing a back molar.
