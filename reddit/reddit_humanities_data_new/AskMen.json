Do not ask questions that treat all men as a singular being.    \nDo not post questions that assume all men think a single way, and you want to know why.  You're already on the wrong path.    \nYour boyfriend/husband/SO is an individual not part of collective male mind.  If you want to know why they did something - ASK THEM, NOT US.    \nYou want to buy your boyfriend/husband/SO a gift, and don't know what to get them, HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM.\n\nYou didn't have a dad growing up and want to ask a question - we got dads here.    \nYou didn't or don't have many male friends and don't understand a reference - we got dudes here.    \nYou never learned how to do a thing that \"every dude\" seems to know how to do, and want it explained - we got those guys here too.\n\nI am saying all this, because lately there has been a swarm of [really anti-female shit being said around here](https://media1.tenor.com/m/eB7HcRqPP-MAAAAC/you-dumb-af.gif), people feeding into it, and then other (usually either anti-male or pro-fem) subs using it to buzz around and [incite fights, flaming and other bullshit.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/LGI22J-z3JIAAAAC/joker-batman.gif)  The bots catch a lot, but the mod inbox the last two weeks has been [full to the brim.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/97Yg4GE43E4AAAAd/jurassic-park-shit.gif)\n\nThis is a safe space.  Liberal, Conservative, Gay, Straight, Bi, Trans, Cis, Married, Single, Poly, Child-free, parenting, POC, White, Religious, Atheist, whatever...thats all part of the male experience, so it's all valued and all valid.\n\nWE THE MODERATION TEAM ARE ASKING - when you see hateful shit, when you see people behaving badly, when you see people being wrong - fucking report it.  if it's reported, report it again - three reports takes it down.

There are so many requirements that I may not fully understand the true purpose of this sub. So I might get downvoted for that reason but here goes.\n\nWhat kind of emotions do men feel when they become a father? What changes inside of you? \n\nFor instance,  my g-son is 33 and he and his wife have 1 son and 3 daughters. 9, 4, 2, and 7 weeks respectfully. He used to cut up with his friends, go tubing down the Guadalupe River in Texas, hunt, camp, etc., He did it all. Once being a bodybuilder. But he put all of that away for the sake of his family.\n\nI watched him morph into fatherhood.  He watched YouTubed videos to learn how to French braid, plait, and ponytail. He does  3 girls hair in the mornings. I've never seem him not change a diaper (even the loaded ones) Or not dress his daughters in the  a.m. or anything else he's been asked to do. And does it happily and willingly. He tucks them in bed at night, he is gentlen and tender with them. \n\nWhat kind of emotional/internal change has he experienced since    becoming a Dad? What  is he feeling? Does he feel a fear or  burden knowing he is looked to to meet their every pysical/emotional needs? \n\nWhat kind of emotions does fatherhood evoke?",

However, one thing that\u2019s important to remember is if she did have any interest in you the way you approached her was respectful and considerate. Unfortunately, it seems as though she\u2019s not interested but the damage is done so there is no point in trying to correct it. Just go about your life and the next time you make the first move still be kind and respectful and you definitely will find a girl who sees the effort you\u2019re making and appreciate it.

I've seen when it goes the other way.  It's not pretty.  She may not take it there.  I don't know, but past experience doesn't guarantee future success.",
            "Opinions get people killed or worse, fired....and every company is different. You can't compare what happened there to what happens here.",
            "> I just thought I had a good read on her is all. \n\nIf your interactions were always at work then you should always assume you do *not* have a good read on the situation.\n\nIf she's hanging out after work, and talking about doing other things outside the office, while outside the office, then it's much more likely you do have a good read on the situation.\n\nThat was my big lesson from my experience. In hindsight it's obvious but that's how lessons work I guess.",
            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come to that. I\u2019d be shocked tbh. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I wasn\u2019t disrespectful or weird. \n\nAs a fellow dude, I think you\u2019re right and the majority of men don\u2019t know shit like that but I\u2019m not in that group. I grew up overweight and after I left college I got super fit. The attention I got after getting fit vs when I was over weight was night and day. It\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve gotten fit. I can USUALLY tell when I\u2019m getting looked at and since I spent time knowing what it\u2019s like to not be looked at I\u2019m not a cocky ass hole about it because I know what it feels like to be invisible.",
            "I do see where you\u2019re going with this and it\u2019s a partial reason I\u2019m a little worried. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t come to that.",
            "I see what you mean but I mean I saw other signs. Other people who I talk to at work don\u2019t get all giddy and nervous when talking to me or don\u2019t smile or get caught looking like she does. Those were the signs I saw and since she is shy and soft spoken I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable by approaching her all of a sudden. I\u2019m not the type of guy that thinks that any girl that is friendly is automatically in to me, I know it doesn\u2019t work like that.",
            "If you have ever approached a girl...men don't get to define what they did as disrespectful or weird...it's always the girl who decides. Brad Pitt can go up to any girl and say anything and he'll be okay. A normal dude says the same thing and gets cancelled. Frankly what you think happened, does not matter in this case. Plenty of sexual harassment happening from men to women on a daily basis and who do you think HR will believe it it comes to that? I'm trying to be as real as possible here.",
            "I'll take what you're saying at face value, but then again, if you were right about reading her and gave her the note, why was she mortified? Nothing against you bro, but the mortified look indicates that you misread the situation. If she is cute and in the Bay Area (assuming that since you mentioned Applied Materials and I got some buds who have been there a while) she is probably taken...isn't it called Man Jose for a reason? I'm not trying to rain on the parade, just playing the devils advocate and hope nothing happens from this.",
            "All you can do now is play it cool and see how it goes.  I'm sure it will blow over if you haven't been too indelicate about things.  Also be careful about apologizing.  It can be taken in different ways.",
            "> I see what you mean but I mean I saw other signs\n\nYeah I know what you mean, because I have been there in my own situation. That's why I shot my own shot.\n\nThe lesson was learning that *all* of the normal signs are different at work, and if they're different, then they're unreliable signs.\n\nOther people mentioned organizing your own after-work event for your coworkers and I really like that idea. \n\nUnfortunately I think we're past the point that it's appropriate to invite her along, unless you make it a weekly thing and let her find out on her own.\n\nI have to ask since you haven't mentioned it yet, how old is she compared to you?",
            "Yeah anyone can perceive something in a way that\u2019s not meant but in my opinion intention is also equally as important as the way it\u2019s received because if something like this is investigated, it matters as well.",
            "It\u2019s in Texas so idk what your talking about and I don\u2019t work at Amat anymore (fuck that place). You\u2019re not raining on my parade, there have been a few girls comment on the post and all of them have assured me what I did was more than ok and not to worry about it, so if I\u2019m taking any comments as advice it would be theirs.",
            "Agreed good sir. I think my best move is to not do anything and if she decides to approach me about it, then I can quickly explain how I misread the vibe and suggest we forget the whole thing.",
            "Yeah this is true, I can admit you have a point with the whole having a read on it at work, you are right.\nThere have been a few girls comment on the thread and they have all said that I shouldn\u2019t worry about it so I feel pretty confident about any back lash. \nShe seems to be in her late 20s and I\u2019m 35 lol but it\u2019s funny everyone I meet that hears my age is like appalled because I look like I\u2019m in my mid 20s."
