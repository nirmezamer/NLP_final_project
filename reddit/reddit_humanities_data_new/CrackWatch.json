People who pirate games usually don't have money or don't want to spend money on them, because there are more important things if you are an adult especially. And they will patiently wait for protection to remove, so companies does nothing in their advantage against that group of people.\n\nThe real problem with denuvo is that it cause trouble for legit game owners. Yeah, it actually does affect game performance, because it's not implemented properly. And that's a fact. Good and quality game will always make a profit for companies, and be praised by buyers. \n\nBut, if you're selling copy-paste games or mediocre ones, of course you won't be confident in your number of sold copies so you need protection implemented.\n\nThe whole point is that denuvo harms even copies of legit owners, so denuvo in this shape and poorly implemented condition is just a tool for companies to improve their bank accounts, nothing else.

I've noticed a lot of you seem to be lacking hope or aren't happy with the state of things at the moment or haven't been for a while. It's funny to me because I remember as a kid in my early teens, over a decade ago, finding out about pirate bay and so many other sites. It felt like Christmas, please try to remember that moment you discovered all of this, the surprise we all felt. It's a miracle any of this exists in the first place and the fact that there's still anyone who works to share free digital games, movies, shows, software, etc is why I still very much appreciate CrackWatch, a place where we can come together and see how far we've come. Even though it has slowed down, who cares, look at all that has been accomplished already. In my eyes pirates have saved more money than I can count. In a world where we hear all the time nothing is free, we can all escape to the high seas and break away from the matrix and enjoy this gift, so appreciate it. And one could say \"bUt iM nEw tO tHe ScEnE\" To you I say most of the old torrents are still around, for example fitgirls repack site has more games on it than I can possible go thru. With other sites being the same, go explore while you wait on a game that your so upset hasn't been cracked yet because \"they are being lazy money grabbers\". That's all for now my one and only post on here lol. Don't try to look at my history as it doesn't exist ;) Thanks to everyone who puts their time toward helping all pirates and to those who still remain grateful Love you all have a good life!\n\nTL;DR- Just be grateful because we could live in a world where NOTHING is free and the high seas never existed.",

            "Hey yall im having trouble being able to access the ER DLC with a save i've transferred from an older version. Ive tried 2 times, downloading the game from 2 different sources, replaced steam\\_api64.dll (i ofc tried skipping this step but when i did my save file didnt show up), but for some reason the npc character thats supposed to appear at mohgs boss arena never shows up. I'm certain I'm able to play with my old character on the new patch as all the new features are available to me and I'm certain that the DLC is installed, I just cant access it for whatever reason and I dont want to create a whole new character to check whether its that\n\nedit: i found a solution. ill try my best to explain but please forgive me if it doesnt make sense lol. essentially what i did is i took the old steam\\_emu.ini file that came with the old pirated version of the game, the one i did my playthrough on (the only way i found to get my save file to work was to include THIS specific ini, if i used the one i got through the new download my save didnt show up) and edited it so that in the \\[DLC\\] section it included the following text and values:\n\n2778580=ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree\n\n2778590=ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree Premium Bundle\n\n2855520=ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree - Artbook & Soundtrack\n\n2855530=ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree Bonus Gesture\n\ni then switched \"DLCUnlockall=0\" to \"DLCUnlockall=1\" and inserted that ini into the new game file that i got from cs.rin, and surprisingly it worked, the game opened, my save file worked, and the new npc finally appeared.\n\nessentially the problem was that the steam\\_emu.ini i was using didnt have the dlc unlocked or included.",

However coming back for the DLC, it appears that the group FLT has been disbanded (?), and the latest version of theirs is v1.04.1 from two years ago. Now it seems that I could install PLAZA-based updates, but it's a massive hassle painstakingly finding + installing all updates chronologically. And crackers mostly likely will not uploading standalone DLC. And ofc the disbanded FLT is not going to upload new ER + DLC (i.e. \"Complete Edition\")...\n\nSo the question is: Is it possible for me to just fresh install the latest ER + DLC pack from another cracker, and use my current game-save without resetting or corrupting my character's progression? i.e. is my FLT-cracked gamesave compatible with any crack currently uploading Complete Edition? If yes, which crack?",

            "yea 3 air is amazing, but for 1, 2, and CD its a very different story. nothing there even approaches being that definitive, because of how damn good their ports have already been.",
            "That's exactly what it is, not what this smartass claims it to be something genius or whatever.",
            "Do you really think a game like FIFA (aka one of the biggest and most profitable games in the world) has a lower version of Denuvo like they can't afford it or something?",
            ">it's a universal fact\n\nI never claimed it is but It is definitely is a majority opinion",
            "For 1 and 2, yes, there is.There's 1 forever and 2 absolute.

            "Yes cause most likely the income for FIFA on PC is a fraction  of what it is on console",
            "A fraction of a game like FIFA is more money than the vast majority of games with Denuvo"
