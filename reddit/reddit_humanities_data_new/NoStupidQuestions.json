Why is Biden the Democratic nominee? What are the chances of Trump winning? Why can Trump even run for president if he's in legal trouble? There are lots of good questions! But, unfortunately, it's often the *same* questions, and our users get tired of seeing them. \n\nAs we've done for past topics of interest, we're creating a megathread for your questions so that people interested in politics can post questions and read answers, while people who want a respite from politics can browse the rest of the sub. **Feel free to post your questions about politics in this thread!** \n\nAll top-level comments should be questions asked in good faith - other comments and loaded questions will get removed. All the usual rules of the sub remain in force here, so **be civil to each other** \\- you can disagree with someone's opinion, but don't make it personal.",

            "If conservatives want a smaller, less controlling government, why do most of them advocate for very controlling ideas? Most of them dislike homosexuality, abortions (sometimes birth control), certain religions, etc and sometimes actively protest against it. Some of them are even anti-free speech despite claiming not to be. Doesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose of a less controlling government?",
            "Do conservatives really not notice the grifting? There\u2019s all this Trump merchandise directed at them, coins, gold mugshots, stuffed animals, posters, shirts, flags, and the hats, of course. Don\u2019t conservatives notice no one is selling paintings of shirtless Biden with giant muscles? There\u2019s no \u201cGet your limited edition solid gold Biden dollar.\u201d Don\u2019t conservatives feel targeted as easy marks by these things?",
            "Why do a lot of americans want a criminal as their president? I mean Europe has had their share of crooked politicians but when they get exposed and convicted their public support drops and they tend to get kicked out of their party. Because we have, you know, standards, for our politicians.",
            "If Biden had the chance why didn\u2019t he codify Roe v. Wade, why?? Why didn\u2019t Obama? It always seems when the Dems can really out their foot down they just don\u2019t. Am I crazy?",
            "Why are people willing to vote against their own financial interests over social issues?",
            "What will happen to the Republican party if Trump loses this election? He has basically completed his takeover with the shenanigans at the RNC. I don't even know if Trump has enough life left in him to last to 2028 and without him, the MAGA movement is basically a wash.",
            "Why makes people believe anything Trump says when his entire career has been based on lies? The first time I learned of him, long before he entered politics, it was clear to me that he was a con man.  I understand he says what certain people want to hear but what makes you actually, truly believe him?",
            "Do votes in the primaries have any effect on the general election? I keep hearing ppl online saying \u201cif you vote for someone other than Biden, it\u2019s a vote for Trump.\u201d But if I vote for someone other than Biden in the primaries, and they don\u2019t move on and Biden does, I can just vote for him in the general election then instead of Trump right?",
            "So.. How do you vote for president? (US)\n\nEmbarrassing.. but this is something I was never taught in school or with family. What all is needed to go and vote? Where am I supposed to go to vote? What time this year are you supposed to vote?\n\nPlease go easy I'm just a young person thrown into the world still trying to figure out life \ud83e\udee3\n\nEdit to include that I am in Arkansas.. thank you everyone for the help!",
            "Can someone clearly state facts as to why trumps trial was rigged? I\u2019m moderate. I\u2019ve voted both sides of the aisle. And even 3rd party.  But the rhetoric against our institutions are very concerning.",
            "Why doesn't the Democratic Party use ranked choice voting or a similar system for their primary process?\n\nIsn't it legal for the Democratic Party to nominate candidates by whatever voting system they want? Couldn't they immediately, radically change their primary system to be whatever they want and as democratic as possible? Why do they go through the same state-by-state primary process as the Republican Party (only with the addition of things like super-delegates, which makes it even less democratic of a process than their opponents')?\n\nI feel like I hear democrats talk extensively about having a broken electoral system as though it's out of their hands, but isn't this huge chunk of the electoral system completely within their power to change?",
            "Trump claims the last presidential election to be rigged. If that were true, why does he bother to run for president again?",
            "As a non-American, I don't understand American obsession with taxes.\n\n\nIn my country, there were not a heavy anti-taxes speech before local youtubers copied that one from Americans. Now it is common.\n\n\nThe question is, why? From the outside, the US seems one of the countries with the less taxes in the world. You don't seem to have a high VAT whatsoever. In some states, there's not even an income tax.\n\n\nStill, American media and social celebrities seem to criticize taxes any time they can. Even democrats, apparently more prone to rise them up, don't mention them a lot.\n\n\nWhy are Americans so apparently obsessed with low them to the ground? With a good tax system you can create guaranteed services for all, including a good public pension planning, free healthcare (which I heard it would take less resources from the public treasure than private assurances system), an unemployment public assurance...\n\n\nI know there are some anti-tax traditions like the Boston tea party. Still that doesn't seem enough? Is it a cultural mentality? Then how?",

            "Is there any way to get a ceasefire resolution, or legislation banning sending arms to Israel, on the ballot so that voters can directly decide the issue once and for all?",
            "I'm not American, and the only news about American's politics I get is either from reddit or from some left-leaning youtubers. I often hear that there are backers (= billionaires or in general people with money) that love Trump and finance him. My question is, since the economy seems to be better under Biden (market wise, stock ecc all seems to have gone up under Biden), why aren't we seeing more people involved in this market endorsing/wanting Biden to win? Or is it just that the right is more vocal?",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my question, so:\r  \n\r  \nImagine a Democrat is running for president. Believing they'll have better luck with earning Republican voters, they run as a Republican. They publicly preach Republican values that they personally do not believe in, and are elected. Day one of their presidency, they go 'mask off' and denounce all the things they used to support and start implementing democratic policies. Or vice versa--a Republican runs as democrat.\r  \n\r  \nObviously nothing like this could actually happen, but if it did, would the president get in legal trouble?",
            "Honest question for MAGA, What do You consider a legitimate news source?",
            "Are the college protestors creating more trump voters and just making matters worse for their cause?\n\nI\u2019m reading all this news about the big protests on college campuses around the US. I can\u2019t help but think this is going to push some older folks to the right, isn\u2019t that going to end up being very counterproductive to their cause?!",
            "Today, the Columbia students took over Hamilton hall and they are strongly voicing their support of the palestine cause. Some are also voicing anger at the Isareli government.\n\nSo ...why protest at their colleges? Like, NYC has a Consulate of Israel. And a UN. And I'm sure there are offices for senators and other congress people in the city. In my mind, it would be like me protesting my dentist because they drive a gas car. I.e. just very tenuous connections to any meaningful action they could take. Wouldn't these other places be more productive for protests?",
            "To me, the police violence against campus protests seems like a clear violation of the first amendment right of people to \"peaceably assemble\". What precedents or common interpretations of law exist that give the universities and police confidence that they can act with impunity against protesters without being held accountable?",
            "What is it called when your leaning changes per issue and per situation? When people say centrist/moderate they are referring to people who say, \"Both sides are the same\" or are sitting on a fence on a particular issue. I absolutely take a side with all issues, but they are not always the same side. What do I self identify as in this situation?",
            "Why do people blame the president for stuff like grocery or gas prices instead of the corporations who haven\u2019t brought prices back down from where they unilaterally jacked them through the roof?",

            "can trump still run for president after being convicted?",
            "Should I be overly concerned or anxious about the election? People are making it sound like the end of the US and it\u2019s got me really nervous.",
            "How can all the polls have trump leading when everyone I know and every person on the street and 90% of the media thinks he mentally deranged? Where are they taking the polls, at trump rallies?",
            "# Why does the democrat party not have any candidates other than Biden?\n\nPretty much the title. Like we saw in the Republican primaries they have a bunch of candidates like Trump, Desantis, Haley, Vivek, Christie etc but when it comes to democrats why only Biden? Clearly he isn't the best candidate considering his age related issues and him standing for the Democrats is clearing hurting the chances of a Democrat victory in 2024 elections. So why has nobody else from Democratic party stood up to contest against Biden? I feel like Democratic party would have a better shot at winning with a young and energetic candidate who represents most of the voterbase of the party.",
            "not an American, but curious to know something. A geopolitics guy I listened in podcast here in India said that the Trump trials are not fair. The reason he gave is because the judicial and investigative officers are politically appointed. The district attorney is a Democrat or something. They are not permanent beurocracy. How true is this?\n\nInteresting thing is that he had way more favourable views of Biden than Trump in terms of their policy throughout the podcast, it was mostly concerning international policy though.",
            "Does the US now effectively have 'red' and 'blue' judges? It seems that lawsuit pressure on Trump is at least partially politically motivated and both sides are packing the courts in their favor; would that eventually result in judiciary split by party lines?",
            "How do you expect Donald Trump to become a dictator if virtually every democrat and plenty of republicans are on high alert for it?\n\nIf he tries, wouldn\u2019t they just be able to say \u201cno\u201d and arrest him? Our democracy isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s plenty more stable than 1930s Germany or Russia when it was a democracy. \n\nIf nobody was suspecting a thing then I could almost understand it. But MANY non Trump supporters are worried about it. Even if he wanted to, it wouldn\u2019t happen.",
            "How do you vote 3rd party? I looked up a sample ballot for my area and they only have republican and democrats listed",
            "Why is Donald Trump anti-China but soft on Russia?",
            "If Kennedy wins some of the electoral votes in the General Election, what happens if neither Biden nor Trump receive enough electoral votes to win? Is there some type of a runoff election?",
            "Not sure if this meets the requirement, but I think it's at least related to US politics: \nTrump has to place some 400+ million in bonds, is that a \"normal\" amount ? Are there other cases with similarly high bond requirements ?",
            "How do I do actual research on presidential candidates?\n\nI just turned 20 and 2024 will be the first time I\u2019m voting in a presidential election. I don\u2019t really like either candidate but I want to learn how to do an actual deep dive on these candidates to see where they stand on the issues.\n\nWhat easily digestible information can I find on what a candidate stands for and see if they\u2019re consistent or if they flip flop. They don\u2019t really teach this well in school, as a lot of legacy biased news exists; and a bunch of people get their political opinions from social media. Especially young people.\n\nWhile I really want a candidate under 50(probably won\u2019t happen), I want to be able to actually form my own opinion and garner authentic thoughts without outside influence or bias.",
            "Is it worth voting for an independent candidate or is it a waste of a vote? Historically speaking, presidents have always been either republican or democrat have we ever had an independent president? And if not would it be a waste to vote for one? I would like to but I also want my vote to make a difference and if it\u2019s not going to matter then should I just settle and vote for one of the other two candidates?",
            "Why did the appellate court lower Trump\u2019s bond in the fraud case?\n\nMost of the explanations I\u2019ve seen are along the lines of \u201che would have had to sell property to make the bond, which would cause him irreparable harm if the verdict was reversed on appeal\u201d\u2026\n\nBut didn\u2019t he literally say on truth social the other day that he has the full bond amount in cash? Why didn\u2019t the appellate court just say \u201cok, fork it over\u201d?",
            "What was the point of Tucker Carlsons weird praise of Moscow.\n\nI am from europe and I have no stakes in USA media or politics, but I consume it. Tucker Carlsons interview with Putin was broadcasted in my country and ofcourse youtube etc. It struck me as wildly idiotic.\n\nThe interview was cringe enough but the weird Moscow propaganda tour afterwards was just unreal.\n\n\"This shopping card system is amazing\" \"this metro station is clean and nice\" \"food is so cheap wow\"\n\nIn the EU it's pretty common knowledge that russia has 2 nice cities: moscow and petersburg and the rest are at best uncomfortable and at worst dismal unhealthy places to live.\n\nSURELY Tucker knows this too right? He can't be that deluded. If he knows, than what's the point? Why show these mundane things and praise them as being otherwordly amazing.\n\nTo me it was so stupid it puzzles me untill this day. I kindly demand answers why this shit happens. Is it a american thing?\n\nFunnily enough, on the other political spectrum Michael Moore made the same mistake in his docu about healthcare by praising Cuban hospitals, while again, it's pretty common knowledge these are hospitals for the rich.\n\nI see these kind of one sidedness alot in USA",
            "What would a civil was in the United States look like?\n\nI'm alarmed at how many people actually seem sincere that they would like a civil war in the US to \"fix\" things. To me a civil war seems completely unnecessary and would be devastating.  \n\nWithout much insight and very broadly speaking I get the feeling that Republican conservatives own a lot of guns and Democrat liberals don't. Would a civil war be armed republicans shooting unarmed democrats?  \n\nDo pro-civil war people think they will be taking on the government and would they stand a chance?",
            "So the border deal is on pause because the house won't bring a vote to the floor. Is there anything in this bill that can be pushed through now via executive order? It seems that the border crisis isn't going to get solved via bipartisan efforts. Wouldn't it make sense to try and pass executive orders to strengthen the border? Even if republicans decide to challenge the orders on basic constitutional grounds (i.e. congress being the one that has to a approve the budget and/or new funding), wouldn't it be terrible optics for them to legally fight against border security measures they have always fought hard for in the past?\n\nIt would seem that:\n\n*\"republicans blocked it in the house!\"*\n\nis a less persuasive argument than:\n\n*\"I signed an executive order that would have shut down the border, but republicans sued me to stop it!\"*\n\nIt feels like Biden is avoiding this because Trump passed similar exec orders during his tenure and was panned by dems for doing it and it seems to drag our a while in the court system. Now that the situation at the border has deteriorated even further it would seem that border related exec orders should be back on the menu. My only question is... Is that a bad look for Biden if he were to go this route? Would it hurt Biden more politically to push for these types of exec orders that it would for the republicans taking it to court to block it?\n\nI'm not the most well versed on this issue so I'm hoping someone that knows more can fill me in on the stalemate and why no one has made a bolder move on this issue.",
            "# Why aren't more presidents shot and killed? (bare with me)\u00a0\n\nI would like to state immediately that I am against murder in any form, and think that if we start killing our political enemies it is absolutely downhill for democracy. This is less a question about murder than it is about the culture in America of gun ownership and the political landscape. Also I am Australian so I am genuinely asking from the outside.\n\nWith the extreme political divide, where people on both sides clearly despise Trump and Biden. With guns being extremely accessible in most parts of America. I am surprised that either one of these two hasn't been shot. Is it the social code? Is it great secret service and private security etc.\n\nSorry if this seems like a bait post it really isn't, I'm genuinely surprised there aren't more attempts on the life of politicians when the divide is so great.",

            "Why isn't fox news held more accountable?\n\nI probably missed a large part since I'm European but after the Jan 6 attack I saw that the rioters and Trump were being held accountable. But isn't Fox News a lot to blame since they're fear mongering 24/7 and spreading the lie that the democrats committed voter fraud? \n\nSorry for my bad English.",

I don't intend for this to be a political post. This is just an interesting shower thought I had.\n\nAs I understand it, Donald Trump is on trial in the state of New York for allegedly using election campaign funds to pay of pornstar Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about a sexual encounter they had.\n\nIf Trump is found guilty, would Daniels have to forfeit this money? Would she still get to keep it? Who does the money technically belong to?",

But what if one of them dies on the eve of the elections? What happens to the electoral process? Will the votes go to the vice-presidential candidate? Will the votes for the deceased be annulled?

Obviously when it comes to appointing judges and making departmental cuts, Trump runs largely unchecked there, unfortunately, but the legislative angle is a big part of the Project as well. The tax cutting and repeal and replacing has all been done before, and on the latter especially, Trump couldn't unite his party on any meaningful legislation (even when the GOP controlled all three chambers). What is the breadth of executive orders? Is Trump hoping the ambiguity of Article II helps the SCOTUS back up his executive overreaches, if (and when) he commits them?\n\nWho knows if it would remain under a Trump administration, but the Supreme Court has, relative to people's expectations, shown more backbone to authoritarian or autocratic measures than people feared",

            "What exactly was the objective of the Jan 6th riot in 2021?\n\nI have a very hard time understanding this, especially from a foreigner's perspective (I live in Ireland) - it seems to me that there's no way anybody involved actually believed that a riot at the Capitol building could actually achieve their stated aims of overturning the results of the election, not least because none of the people they were calling on to do so actually had the legal or institutional power to make it happen. Had they succeeded in actually murdering any of the congresspeople or officials they were talking about killing (Mike Pence for example), it still wouldn't have allowed Trump to stay on as president as there is a very clear line of succession and very formal systems in place to deal with exactly these kinds of scenarios in the US legal system.\n\nMoreover, it's widely acknowledged and was even communicated desperately to Trump himself during the riot by his own closest supporters, that a riot like this was going to totally destroy any public goodwill they had and alienate far, far more supporters than it galvanised, both in the general public and in their own party. It's widely rumoured, for example, that Trump's planned pardon list, which supposedly included many celebrity-types that his supporters were calling for pardons of (Assange and Joe Exotic for instance) was essentially stillborn specifically because establishment Republicans like McConnell used the threat of impeachment to neuter Trump's ability to do anything drastic in his final hours as president.\n\nThe riot was obviously a colossal *blow* and *setback* to Trump's ambitions and those of his movement. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved seriously imagined that it would end in anything other than both failure and reputational collapse.\n\nAll that being said... What was the actual point? Am I missing something, or was the riot achieving the stated aims of preventing the handover to Joe Biden literally impossible from the beginning - and that this was so blindingly obvious that nobody involved seriously thought it would achieve this, and thus must have had other motivations?\n\nForget the morality and ethics of it in this case, I'm just wondering on a purely practical level, even to someone who believed that the election was rigged and that Trump should remain as president, what in hell did any of those people imagine storming the building would actually achieve in practical terms?",

            "\\*\\*Why did/do Republicans oppose the ACA so much?\\*\\*From what I understand health insurance companies in the US make a ton of money in the year 2024 (14 yrs after the bill), the ACA has been a benefit for the American economy as reflected by CBO analysis and common sense, and the ACA has benefitted low income people (who live in red states and blue states) and small business owners (who are the Republican ideal of the American dream). Republicans have an equal chance to Democrats of becoming chronically ill (hence having a pre-existing condition) and benefitting from those protections. Republicans and Democrats have children who can contribute more to the economy if they have that guarantee of healthcare until they can get into a stable career by 26. I understand that people on the left say ACA didn't go far enough, but as a fundamentally market-driven plan, I don't get why the right would oppose the final plan as passed.\n\nWhat says \"trust the market\" like a marketplace where you can compare different options and select the one that you, the consumer, favor? Isn't this the fundamental idea of like, a store? Meanwhile, the pre-ACA landscape meant it was extremely difficult to get an affordable plan as a self-employed person or small-business owner - you had to go to the firms yourself, as if you had to buy your orange juice by calling to Tropicana wholesale department.\n\nThis is before asking the question from the empathy angle and the privilege of being healthy and not having a pre-existing condition that often was a result of circumstances outside of one's control.",

And a 5% voter swing from one side to another is considered a MASSIVE achievement/failure (depending on which side you're on).\n\nThat always seemed odd to me, but these days it seems even more strange.

Running elections is expensive. Doing so through the state election apparatus means the DNC or state Democratic Party isn't paying for it. There are still a handful of caucus states where the state political party gets stuck with the bill, but overall this is not currently an expense the Democratic Party gets stuck with very often, and when they do, the Republican Party gets stuck with the same expense.\n\n It would become their expense if they want to change it to \"whatever they want.\" That becomes money you can't spend on getting your nominee elected.\n\n2.) The Democratic Party, like the Republican Party, is really a series of a bunch of smaller state political parties  that are in union with one another. Part of this is practical. The state has its own government, and political parties form to contest power there. Elections for Congress are still state run affairs and require candidates to be state residents. Ballot access requirements for presidential elections are onerous, especially considering you have to do it 51 times, and its easier to have an organization permanently on the ground that just does this crap for your national nominee. Part of it is just inertia. National political parties have always been organized as a union of state political parties, even prior to the Democrats and Republicans being the major parties. No viable \"3rd way\" has ever been successfully executed by a political party. \n\nBecause you're dealing with a bunch of state political parties, the state parties conduct primaries internally, then come together at a national convention to try to get on the same page with a single nominee. Usually, that works. Occasionally, the cats can't be herded, and some of the state political parties fracture or rebel.

            ">Is it a cultural mentality? Then how?\n\nI'd argue that culture plays a LOT into it. The US is very much on a far end of the individualist-collectivist spectrum, and I think that public opinion and public services & structures have a back-and-forth relationship, influencing each other here.\n\nTake healthcare, for example. If a person makes poor health decisions, they are likely to incur higher medical costs - and the opposite tends to be true for those who regularly make good health decisions. US culture looks at this situation through an individualistic lens: everyone is personally responsible for managing their own health, and facing the consequences of their personal decisions. As such, public-funded healthcare can be perceived as superfluous at best, or supportive of other people's poor health choices at worst.\n\nThe only reason why the Affordable Care Act hasn't been repealed is because citizens recognize that not all health conditions are caused by poor health choices, and many people can just get terrible rolls of the dice. So we're stuck looking at awkward compromises: how can a society that doesn't want to financially support people's poor health choices, create and manage a public healthcare program that treats people who deserve treatment?",

            "u/Jtwil2191 is quite correct in the way that the President makes an easy target for the blame game.  For most sectors of the economy, the President has little control unless he wants to take drastic or dangerous economic action.\n\nThe one qualifier I want to make, though, is gas prices.\n\nIn response to the energy shocks of the 1970s, Congress passed legislation that prevented US produced oil from being sold on the global market. For 40 years, the US could import oil but couldn't export it. This helped keep US oil prices stable for decades. And if the President wanted to make an impact on gas prices, he could release some of the strategic oil reserve.  Americans were somewhat insulated to global petroleum price shocks.\n\nBut in 2016, then-President Obama lifted the export ban and US oil prices became very susceptible to the machinations of OPEC.

Checks and balances I think will prevent anything that would make you overly concerned or anxious.\n\nThe best recent example of this: Trump may or may not win re-election and congress has already acted to prevent a President from leaving NATO unilaterally. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, enacted on December 22, 2023, prohibits the President from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO without approval of a two-third Senate super-majority or an act of Congress.

            "I think the evidence is pretty clear that a Trump win is more likely to lead to catastrophic consequences than we have seen in a long time. That doesn\u2019t mean it necessarily well. But he attempted to overthrow the government of the United States in order to illegally stay in office once. The reason that that did not succeed was largely, because certain Republican office holders, many of whom were Trump appointed, including the vice president, refused to forsake their oath, and do what he wanted. I think it is pretty clear that Trump understands that that was a mistake, from his perspective, and if he is  Allowed in the White House again, he will be more aggressive in putting toadies, and yes men in positions of power. On the other hand, he\u2019s also incredibly lazy and highly uneducated about how politics and political machinery works. So it\u2019s also very possible that he might try and be unsuccessful yet again.\n\nHis second economic program is also atrocious. The reason that he is having any success at all in the polls is because people are unhappy about the inflation that occurred in 2022, which, in fact the Administration has handled fairly well. But if you actually look at Trump\u2019s announced economic policies, they\u2019re all way more inflationary. He\u2019s planning to impose an across-the-board tariff, which functions as a tax on consumers, which will make products in American stores significantly more expensive expensive while also reducing the ability of American products to compete globally. He will pair this with a huge tax cut for the rich. Both of these policies are likely to notably increase prices for American consumers. But again, his ability to impose these reactionary economic ideas is based in part on the make up of Congress. So while his economic plans are disastrous, we could get lucky, and he will just be a complete failure as opposed to actively destructive of the post Covid economic recovery.",

Trump used $170 million of the $375 million to pay off a loan on the property. Other proceeds went to his children.  \n>  \n>$60 million, plus interest, from selling the rights to manage a New York City golf course in June 2023.

However, that money also went to many Americans who did not necessarily need that additional money, and contributed to the rise in savings that occurred in 2020-2021. When the world reopened, Americans (and the world in general) when on an absolutely mad spending spree with their saved-up money, and increased demand (combined with continuing supply chain issues) helped drive prices up. \n\nNow, these checks went out under Biden *and* Trump, but Biden did sign into law the additional round of chese checks. Had he not sent those out, or perhaps had those checks been distributed in a more targetted way, the economy wouldn't have gotten so hot so quickly. Other spending programs Biden signed into law may have contributed as well. However, we can say these *may have contributed*, but we can't say they *caused* inflation. And inflation is a global phenomenon at the moment, with some countries having inflation far higher in than in the US.\n\nMany econimists argued for months that a recession was in the US economy's near future, but it appears the country has dodged.

Sometimes there will be counter protesters and/or police who try to provoke the protesters and engage in violence (to a greater or lesser degree, this can be as minor as shoving or throwing empty water bottles to something much more violent). This is usually just on the fringes of the large march, though. Often elected politicians will show up and either give a speech or, in some cases, walk around and engage with the crowd. Some of these protests will have the goal of occupying a public space, in which case people will gather with the intent of staying for as long as possible. Others will end at a set time and people go home.\n\nThe smaller ones tend to be more dynamic and have less of a feel of an organized event. Sometimes there will be a specific goal, like \"we're going to paint messages at this spot, or deface this statue, etc\". People will gather there, ideally in non-descript black bloc and not carrying anything personally identifying (including a phone). You perform the action, then GTFO and never talk about it again. Others protests will have the goal of drawing attention and engaging with opposition. Again, wear black bloc and don't carry anything that can identify you. People gather somewhere they know either counter protestors or police are likely to be. You then chant slogans, toss small items, or otherwise find ways to engage the opposition with the goal of getting them to backdown/retreat so you can gain ground against them.\n\nOften the larger, more planned event-style protests will devolve into smaller ones after the designated end time.",
            "At the constitutional convention, there were three main proposals for how to elect the President.\n\nThe first option was to have Congress vote on it. This was ultimately discarded because the founders felt that electing the President and Congress separately would reinforce separation of powers and authority.\n\nThe second option was to have a nationwide popular vote. This was a very popular idea, except among the slave-owning southern states. These people feared that the voting power of their states would be diminished since their slaves would not be allowed to vote. So, even though this idea sounds pretty great, we dropped it because slave-owners said no.\n\nThe third option was the electoral college. In many ways this is a \"figure it out later\" solution, but after the other two were discarded for various reasons, this was the only option left that everyone could agree on. The gradual transition from electors debating and choosing, or electors being chosen by statewide vote as they are now, was mostly a matter of political strategy between competing states in the 1800s -- there's nothing that says a state has to do it that way.\n\nIf we could rebuild the whole thing all over again, I think there is basically no chance that we would intentionally build the process in this exact same way.",
            "To prevent tyranny of the majority. Electoral college, at the time (when the constitution was being written), seemed like the best way for votes to be heard without being muffled by the majority vote (which would be popular vote).\n\nAnother point is that all 50 states have differing laws, and popular vote may exclude some (criminals, for example) in some states - but include in some others.",

            "Because the United States is made up of 50 separate entities; and those entities all have different laws. One the big differences in laws between those states is who has the right to vote, and how they can vote.\n\nSome states allow felons to vote, some states don't.  Some states require ID to vote, some states don't.  Some states automatically register voters once they reach the age of 18, some states don't. See where I'm going with this? For a more detailed list of differences in voting laws by state, you can refer to this - https://www.vote411.org/voting-rules\n\nNow the real answer to your question on \"why\" we don't determine the President by the popular vote - it's because every state doesn't share the same structure on who can vote.  We use the electoral college because you can't do a nationwide popular vote when everyone isn't on the same page.  The electoral college allows us to award a score based on who won the popular vote on a state by state basis; so it's not like we don't use the popular vote at all to determine who wins.  It's just limited to a state by state basis. If it was a nationwide popular vote, many states would take issue with other states allowing [x] because they don't.",

Also, there were some on-the-ground political realities.\n\nLet's start with the most easy answer:\n\n**On-The-Ground Political Realities:** When Donald Trump (or his organization) is charged with a crime, historically they have responded by flooding the legal system with delaying actions, counter suits, and harassment. When the DA in the Georgia case (Fani Willis) was deciding whether or not to move forward to charge former President Trump with election tampering/interference/whatever her office had to consider Trump's legal strategy. Her office is a modest-sized county DA office. They do not have the resources to deal with everything that Trump and company would throw at them. This would be the only case that they could handle for years.  So they waited.\n\nIt was the same situation in the New York case.  If any of the states moved before the Feds it would have been (near) crippling for their state or county's legal system.  And even if they won a conviction against Mr. Trump, there's every chance that he would be in the White House when one of the subsequent appeals happened. And then he would be untouchable.\n\nYou can see why none of the states wanted to be the first.\n\n**Self-Interest & Cowardice:** The most egregious example of how self-interest and cowardice has stopped Mr. Trump from being indicted is the current AG, Merrick Garland.\n\nOn January 6th 2020 Mr. Trump's failed insurrection against the United States was broadcast live into the homes of every American with a television set. But it took Mr. Garland *two years* to appoint a special counsel. *Two years* to start investigating.\n\nIt took Dick Cheney's daughter running laps around him and Mr. Trump announcing his candidacy before he started the investigation of this horrendous crime.\n\nMerrick Garland is so cowardly and so ultra-sensitive to accusations of \"being political\" that he is willing to engage in dereliction of duty.\n\nIt's worth reiterating that Garland did not appoint a special council until *after* Mr. Trump announced that he was running for office again.  That announcement gave AG Garland a reason to worry about his own career and ambitions (SCOTUS seat) so he waited to launch an investigation until *his* political future was threatened.\n\n**tl;dr:** Trump's trials are happening now because his legal strategy is effective, because his candidacy may negatively impact the careers of powerful people, and because Merrick Garland is a coward.",

            "Homelessness is an intentional part of the current US Economic system.\n\nThe Federal, State, and local governments spend considerably more money dealing with homelessness related issues that it would cost to simply give each person a free apartment. Vacant housing is available in all 50 states, so supply is not an issue, and even considering price concerns, it's still less money to give every homeless individual a home, no strings, no time limit, nada.\n\nFrom that reality you can conclude that the only reason the government would willingly spend extra funds to keep homelessness in existence, is because they want it to exist.\n\nWhy is that? Well simple, homelessness acts as a disincentive towards not participating the in the US labor force the way they want to. Can't live on one job? Well then you better work two jobs, better work yourself so hard that you don't have time to make trouble or worry about anything other than survival, because if you do, you might end up homeless!\n\nThe homeless also regularly act as an extremely convenient scapegoat for the government.

A lot of it is rests on the Unitary Executive Theory, which is a political theory that the President solely and individually is in charge of the government and can do pretty much whatever he wants in that regard. It involves ideas like \"impoundment\" which is a practice where the President refuses to spend money as Congress allocates. So Congress could pass whatever laws they want and Trump could simply refuses to enact them. Under this practice, he would even then redirect funds from where Congress allocated them to do whatever else he wanted with it. So, for example, if Congress allocated funding to expand healthcare coverage, Trump could just refuse to spend the money on healthcare and instead use it to build detention facilities at the border or whatever else he wanted.\n\nThere's also another concept in Project 2025 called Schedule F, which would reclassify a huge swath of the federal civil service as political appointees, allowing him to fire them at will if he wanted and replace them with loyalists. There are currently almost 3 million federal employees in the country, but only ~4,000 of them are political appointees. The Project 2025 plan for schedule F would reclassify at least 500,000, and possibly up to 1.5 million, of those federal employees as political appointees. Trump could then institute loyalty tests and fire anyone he deems as insufficiently loyal.\n\nThose are just 2 examples, but a huge part of the premise behind Project 2025 is things that a President can do on his own without Congress.",

            "There are a few different avenues by which Americans have developed more positive feeligns towards Russia.\n\nHistorically, if was the American left where you could find affinity for Russia.  They believed the communist USSR had actually achieved some kind of utopic alternative to American capitalism. However, the USSR has not existed for decades, and Russia hasn't been communist for as long if not longer. While there are definitely still a few (frankly delusional) people who believe in this narrative, the American left is no longer the primary source of American support for Russia.\n\nInstead, the pro-Russia American sentiment comes from largely the American right, and there are a couple reasons for that.\n\n**FIRST**, you have a rise of support for an isolationist foreign policy. It's right there in the MAGA name: America first, everyone else second. Trump's rise has thrust this policy to the forefront of the Republican Party, something that many old-school conservatives are not happy with (see support for Ukraine aid among Republicans like Senator McConnel.)\n\nNow, this viewpoint, in and of itself, is not inherently pro-Russia. You can believe that the US needs to do less overseas and focus more at home without supporting Russia. However, when you combine a belief that the US is doing too much with Russian propaganda that the US and its NATO allies *provoked* Russia into invading Ukraine through their provocative actions and policies, you get to a place where people claim Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a defense against US actions. (This position has some crossover appeal: RFK Jr originally ran as a Democrat before switching to Independent for the 2024 election, and he promotes this narrative.)\n\n**SECOND**, Putin has long presented Russia as a bulwark against the liberal ideologies \"tainting\" Western countries. According to this narrative, Russian still believes in the societal importance of Christianity (although in reality non Eastern Orthodox denominations are suppressed and even persecuted), emphasizes traditional social and family structures, rejects LGBTQ+ as a societal norm, \"traditional\" conceptions of masculinity, and so on.\n\nAmerican conservatives have spent decades cultivating the victim complex that is the cultural wars and promoting the idea that traditional Americanism is under assault from godless liberals who want to destroy what made the country great. Now Putin is intentionally gearing his messaging not only to his supporters in Russia, but also to an international audience that includes Americans. And it has worked, with many conservatives warming to Putin's Russia has a kind of bastion of conservative values.\n\n**THIRD**, Trump. Trump *clearly* admires authoritarians and is frustrated with the (little-d) democratic restraints on the presidency. He has heaped praise not only on Putin, but also on Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and others. Having run a business with his name on it where he can largely order people around, he believes he should be able to run the government in largely the same way. While **ONE** and **TWO** would still be the case, I think Trump's personal admiration for Putin created a greater opening for conservatives to warm to Putin than would have happened without Trump.",

            "The Republican and Democratic Parties both have rules in place about what to do to replace a candidate if they are unable to run after receiving the nomination. Basically, they pick a replacement and things carry on as normal.\n\nHowever, in your scenario, there's no time to update the ballots. What I think would happen is that the election would proceed as scheduled (the date of the election si set by law), with people voting for their preferred candidate (even though one of them is dead). Let's assume the dead candidate's party (somehow) got the message out to everyone to vote as they otherwise normally would have, and the dead candidate received enough votes to win.\n\nIn the US presidential election, voters are *not* voting for the candiates. They're voting for electors, who in turn represent the states in the Electoral College where the winner is chosen. This dumb system which has handed the election to losing candidates in the past could actually address this problem of a dead candidate relatively easily. The dead candidate's party would tell the dead candidate's electors to vote for the replacement candidate. All of dead candidate's electors then vote for replacement candidate, and things proceed as normal.\n\nOf course, this whole process would be total chaos and there would be all kinds of objections and attempts to alter the process. The dead candidate's supporters may not show up out of confusion for what was going on. Some states have legal barriers against faithless electors which may muck up the process of casting electoral votes for candidates who did not appear on the ballot (but IIRC no state stipulates an actual punishment for an elector voting for someone else, so it's kind of a moot point). State legislatures may tried to alter how their electors operate.

(Of course, Republicans negotiated and agreed to a bill with Democrats that combined Ukraine aid with immigration reform and border security, but Trump and the Republicans didn't want Biden to have a \"win\" on the issue leading up to the election, so they killed a bill they negotiated.)\n\nIf Republicans didn't have the razor thin margin they currently have, they could probably pass Ukraine aid.

            "There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on here, but ultimately it fundamentally is based in the nature of the Republican coalition. Most Republican elites are cosmopolitan, and all they care about is cutting taxes on rich people and reducing the burden of regulation on business, despite the fact that this will cost lives. However, these political positions are insanely unpopular. As a result, the Republican voting base is primarily not motivated by cutting taxes on rich people and making it easier for businesses to get away with killing workers and customers in order to increase their profits. The republican base is primarily, not exclusively, motivated by social concerns. For different Republicans, this could be any number of issues,  but a very significant part of the Republican base is very anti-sex. This includes people who are anti-abortion, but that is not all of it. Fundamentally it is a discomfort with the idea of people having recreational sex, the idea of people being able to control their own sexual experience, and the ability of people to control their own experience of parenthood. They want sex to be dangerous and they want sex to be highly consequential, and as a result, fewer people will be having it. \n\nThis is not some conspiracy theory, this is what Republican social thinkers talk about publicly. It is why conservatives have consistently been against sex education, even though comprehensive sex education reduces abortion rates. It\u2019s why they\u2019ve been against public provision of birth control, and even *private purchase* of birth control, even though birth control reduces abortion rates. And it is why they were against IVF, because IVF allows people to control their own experience of parenting.\n\nSince Dobbs, Republicans have been in the position of the dog who caught the car. For 50 years, Republican elites, who don\u2019t care about abortion (Does anybody actually think that Donald Trump has not paid for an abortion or two in his time? Well, OK, bad example, he never pays for anything) have raised money and rallied voters on the basis that they would turn back the clock to the 1950s when recreational sex was dangerous and parenthood was something that you could never plan it just happened whether you wanted it or not. This has also been going on long enough that generations of Republican leaders have come up from the rube faction. This is why there are lots of Republicans and Congress who don\u2019t understand the bargain, because, while they certainly do want to cut taxes on rich people and let businesses get away with killing employees and customers that gets in the way of profits, they are *even more*motivated by this wackadoodle Sex negativity. \n\nSo, to get to your ultimate question, why did 100+ Republicans sponsor a bill that will ban IVF? In some cases, they actually want to ban IVF just like they want to ban everything that puts sex in control of the people having sex; they just didn\u2019t expect anyone to find out unless it was a fait accompli. While in other cases, they figured that it was unlikely that this bill would pass. So they expected that it would be a bill that they could use to prove their anti-sex bona fides to their anti-sex base, through media channels directed specifically at those people, while would not get much traction in the wider press.

There are roles, usually agents of the government, that require immunity from prosecution when carrying out specific functions of that job.  But those are extremely rare.  For example, a police officer can claim that subduing a criminal is part of her job.  Assuming that she's doing it while on duty and it is in service of the public.  She can't just handcuff some guy that she sees at an airport.\n\nLikewise the President may have to take actions as part of his job that would be illegal in another setting.  For example, President Obama ordered the extra-judicial killing of a US citizen in 2011.  He has not been prosecuted for this because the drone strike ordered by the then-President was part of an anti-terrorism operation; a very legitimate function of the President.\n\nMr. Trump, however, is looking for blanket immunity.  He wants all actions taken during a presidency to be immune form prosecution.  Given the charges he is currently facing, we can see why he would push for this position.\n\nGreat question!",

            "By January 6, Trump and his allies were running out of options and time.\n\n[The court challenges had failed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_U.S._presidential_election)\n\n[The false elector schemes had failed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot)\n\n[His efforts to pressure states like Georgia to \"produce\" votes for him had failed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call)\n\nThere was one more opportunity to reverse his loss in the 2020 election. According to the Constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of votes from the Electoral College, the House of Representatives votes for the next president. (This has happened thrice in American history: 1801, 1825, and 1837.) While the House had a Democratic majority in 2020, the procedure for voting for president is different than normal House business. Rather than each member voting (which presumably result in Biden winning, since there were more Democratic members than Republican), each *state delegation* gets one vote. While Republican had fewer total members, they controlled more state delegations.\n\nSo if Trump could prevent Congress from certifying the results of the Electoral College vote, presumably the job of choosing the next president would fall to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for him to become president.\n\nTrump's first target was Mike Pence. As Vice President, he was responsible for overseeing the certification of the election. Using a widely discredited interpretation how the certification process is managed, Trump pushed the idea that Pence could unilaterally reject electoral votes from states with alleged fraud or \"irregularities\", reducing Biden's total electoral votes to less than the necessary 270 to win. He also pushed Republican legislators to reject the electoral votes when possible.\n\nTo \"encourage\" all of this to happen, Trump hoped to wield the threat of violence by his supporters to coerce Pence and/or members of Congression to throw the election to him. At minimum, he wanted to prevent Biden's certification for as long as possible as he and his allies worked various schemes and brainstormed new ones to keep him in power. Likewise, his supporters who attacked the Capitol hoped that their presence would result in this.\n\nThis was always a long shot at best.

Immunity from criminal prosecution is a fact-intensive inquiry. Turn away from politics for a moment and consider a murder case in which the Defendant claims self-defense. Self-defense is grounds for immunity from prosecution. But you can\u2019t just yell \u201cself-defense!\u201d and walk out of the courtroom a free man. You bear the burden of showing that you acted reasonably and in self-defense, given the facts and circumstances unique to this incident. If you meet that burden, the case goes away. If you don\u2019t meet that burden, the prosecution goes forward (and you can still claim self-defense at trial).\n\n Turning back to politics, the Court is considering a single question: \u201cWhether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d Even if they rule that he does, the former president would still bear the burden of showing that his conduct involved official acts during his tenure in office (I.e., he can\u2019t claim it for acts that fall outside his duties as president).",

In previous decades, migration was mostly unoccampanied adults, generally men looking for work. Right now, it is increasingly families and even unaccompanied children trying to cross.\n\nRepublicans have long been critical of migration, for both racist and non-racist reasons, while Democrats have generally been more supportive, we are at the point where, regardless of your politics, both sides agree that the situation is untenable; we have reached some objective definition of \"crisis\". However, this is not because they are bringing drugs (drugs are primarily ferried over by people at legal border crossings) or crime (despite some high profile instanes of criminal activity links to migrants, there is no evidence for a causal link between the surge in migrant crossings and rising crime rates in the US, which are in fact actually *falling* in many places) or anything like that. Nor are people just surging across the border unimpeded as if no border existed. But managing the sheer number of people is extremely difficult and is overwhelming the resources of both the DHS managing the border crossings as well as the states/municipalities handling the migrants if/when they are allowed to cross.\n\n***Venezuelans being released from prisons and insane asylums to come here***\n\nThis seems to be a conspiracy propogated by Brietbart, a far-right website, and no evidence for this claim has been presented other than an unnamed DHS source.

This is not a new development, but it's also specific to New York City, not the state at large. I am not sure what is meant by Gov. Hochul \"telling people to literally open their doors and let them live here\", so you would have to provide a source on that if you want clarification.\n\n***how they're getting everything (green cards, homes, food, jobs, etc.) for free***\n\nMany of the migrants are claiming refugee status, and the US has a variety of programs in place to support refugees. If their application for refugee status is accepted, they are then let into the US while a final decision on their application is pending. This is *not* the same as a getting a green card, as the final decision could be to reject their application, at which point they would no longer have legal permission to live in work and in the US, and would be undocumented if they remained. As for shelter and food, again, there are extant programs in the US to support homeless populations and migrants on a temporary basis; this has always been the case. However, the sheer number of migrants trying to enter the country could mean that additional housing is being found on an ad hoc basis, like renting out hotels to put the migrants in, because there isn't time or existing resources to figure out another way to keep them off the streets.",

If a party ever loses by too much, they'll be forced to shift slightly to win over just enough centrist voters to become viable again (without sacrificing too many of their more ideological voters).

You like affordable food?  Thank globalization.  Especially if you don't live in the United States.\n\nPrior to US military hegemony, there was only one model that got nations the resources they needed to have advanced, industrialized economies: colonization.  If the US instantly stopped military influence in other nations, then the nations of the world would very quickly snap back to the only other model that ever worked for them: colonialism (with a dash of mercantilism).\n\nThe horrors of the 19th century would rear their ugly heads as England, France, Germany, China, Japan, Australia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey would have to compete with one another to plunder the raw materials and resources needed to maintain their economies from weaker, poorer countries.  And this, if you remember you high school history class, causes an increasing cycle of demand in the richer nations.  Plundering from and competing with other nations requires a military.  And military competition leads to arms races and shifting alliances (sometimes secret alliances).\n\nAny of this sounding familiar?\n\nFinally, to close out this post, I want to point out that even if the US abandoned Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, it can't abandon Canada or South and Central America.  It would need to keep other colonizing powers from plundering the resources of its neighbors.  America needs many raw materials from its immediate sphere of influence to keep its own economy running.  It would not be possible for the US government to abandon its own hemisphere without the US population rioting because smart phones would then cost several thousand dollars and a Big Mac would cost twenty five bucks.\n\nGreat question!",

This is insanely dangerous.\n* During an emergency broadcast, he misspoke about the path of a hurricane. After he was corrected about this, he refused to admit his error and instead continued to lie about the hurricane. This was a situation where people needed timely and correct information to protect human lives.\n* Participated in fraudulent attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 election so that he could remain in office after his term had ended. His slow-moving coup attempt was ham-fisted, but nevertheless utterly unacceptable.\n* Lied about things a lot. I know that all politicians lie sometimes. Trump lies a *lot*, even by that standard.\n\nI'm sure there's more, for example his long history of being racist, but like I said, that's off the top of my head.\n\nBiden isn't my favorite guy, mind you, but to my knowledge he doesn't get into the kinds of things like I mentioned above.",

This will shrink the U.S. economy and very possibly cause a recession. It will definitely increase prices. A tariff is a tax that is ultimately borne by the consumer, and the tariffs Trump supports will have a much more significant inflationary effect. Given that we are already flirting with inflation (which Biden and the Fed have successfully reduced to normal levels, but it\u2019s waiting for its chance), this could be catastrophic and will be at best be very painful. Trump is also advocating for another huge unfunded tax cut for the rich, which will lead to Social Security cuts when the trust fund goes dry (although that is several years away), while working and middle class people will suffer tax increases. \n\nDepending on the makeup of Congress, Trump has also committed, once again, to repealing Obamacare, which would both increase the deficit *and* lead to millions losing their health insurance. The GOP came within a single vote of doing this during Trump\u2019s first term; it is well within possibility of them succeeding.\n\nTrump and many Republicans have supported nationwide abortion bans.

[They promised territory to Arab nationalists in order to secure their support against the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence); [they promised to support European Jews in establishing a homeland in the region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration); and [they promised to divide up the land with the French for their respective empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement).\n\nObviously, it was impossible to do all of theses things and please everyone. Arabs were unhappy with the Jewish immigrants arriving in British-controlled Mandatory Palestine, and Jewish settlers were unhappy with British efforts to restrict further Jewish immigration to the region. The British dealt with violence perpetrated by both Arab and Jewish militant groups, directed at each other as well as at the British administration for the region. An ultimately unsuccessful 1936-39 revolt by Palestinian Arabs resulted in a strong response from British authorities (often assisted by Jewish militant groups, who sided with the British against the Palestininans), and the damage dealt to Palestinian nationalist groups in the aftermath contributed to the Arab defeat in the 1948 War.\n\nFollowing the revolt, the British government organized the Peel Commission (1936) and Woodhead Commission (1938) to make recommendations about how to proceed in Mandatory Palestine. The conclusion was some kind of partition was necessary, but they were unable to make a recommendation of what a successful partition would actually look like. By 1947, the British declared that they were be ending their mandate in Palestine and would give the United Nations final decision making. Ultimately, the United Kingdom abstained from the UN vote that established the 1947 Partition.\n\nBritain's colonial ambitions no doubt contributed to the volatile situation in Palestine. They at times supported and at other times undermined both Zionism and Palestinian nationalism when it was convienent for their interests. But Jewish immigration to the region began under the Ottomans, and neither Arab nationalism nor Zionism was created by the British. Those groups may well have clashed without British involvement. It's impossible to argue for something that didn't happen, because that's not how history works, but I think it would be difficult to argue that the British positively impacted the region's stability with their presence.",

That's certainly a budget cut that they'd need to account for, which would likely require a cut in their services.\n\nBut also, public money is separate from fundraised money, because it's a funding source that's not dependent on services that align with fundraising efforts. Public funding could be spent on services that don't bring in much revenue, like supporting local stations for rural areas that don't serve very many people. Do their super popular Tiny Desk Concerts not make much money? If not, those might be on the chopping block.\n\nThe more that NPR is dependent on their independent fundraising efforts, the more their services are going to prioritize those donors. This not only makes access to their network less equitably accessible, it also puts NPR closer and closer to the pitfall traps that other private networks are in, where *reporting* can be biased by private funding sources (ie. \"We can't run a story that's critical of this company, because they're sponsoring us.\").

But by then he would be an 82-year-old, twice-over-presidential-loser, presumably  (or I guess I should say, hopefully) going up against a much younger Democratic candidate (important when so many voters are concerned about the age of their politicians). He may also be in prison. Of course, we should know by now that betting against Trump is a risky endeavor, but the obstacles he would face would only grow relative to what he's facing now.",
            "The 34 charges Trump was convicted of were all misdemeanor bookkeeping violations (paying off Daniels was perfectly legal, lying about it on his taxes wasn\u2019t). The problem for the prosecution is that the statute of limitations expired years ago, so ordinarily Trump couldn\u2019t be prosecuted for it.\n\nThe prosecutors found a law that said that misdemeanor charges could be upgraded to felony charges (and thus remain in the statute of limitations) if the defendant committed an unrelated additional crime while committing the misdemeanor crimes. They then said that the additional crimes were three\u00a0federal election law violations. This gets pretty dicey legally, as state prosecutors (Bragg) can\u2019t prosecute federal offenses, and the misdemeanor upgrade law had never before been used to couple state and federal crimes. Judge Merchan accepted Bragg\u2019s argument, but this is certainly going to be reconsidered by the appeals courts.\n\nSo Bragg lays out his argument for why Trump is guilty of the 34 bookkeeping charges, as well as the three federal crimes that Trump wasn\u2019t charged with. Merchan instructs the jury to first deliberate charged offenses, and if they find him guilty to consider whether or not Trump also committed the federal crimes that he hadn\u2019t been charged with.\u00a0\n\nThe final part of the jury instructions, and what your questions ask, is that Merchan told the jury that they weren\u2019t required to be unanimous on any of the three federal counts, so long as there was unanimous support that Trump had broken at least one of the them. If jurors 1-7 thought that Trump had broken the first federal law, jurors 4-11 thought that he had broken the second, and only juror 12 that he had broken the third, then the Merchan would have considered this a unanimous decision. Suffice to say, an appeals court might think differently.\n\nThat\u2019s what the complaints are about. We don\u2019t know which, if any, of three federal laws the jury thought that Trump broke.",

Of course, this argument would be hypocritical if it came from a conservative who is otherwise staunchly pro-2A. However, there are some conservatives who support some forms of gun control.

I know there aren't any rules to life, and that people do things at different speeds, but I know I've missed out on what most people consider normal, average experiences. \n\nFor example: I've never been in any romantic or sexual relationship. Never been on a date, kissed someone, or held anyones hand. I never had friends as a kid/teen/young adult, and was quite literally isolated and shut in most of my life. Never went to any big parties, I've never gone to any bars, never had a night out drinking or anything like that. The past couple of years I've made a few friends which is nice. I dropped out in tenth grade, never finished school or got any higher education, last time I had a job was when I was 17. I never ever really hung out with friends in my childhood, I have no experiences or accomplishments to my name. \n\nI honestly feel so pathetic and like a loser. I don't see any of this changing any time soon, and I know that I'm never going to get this time back and will never get to experience some of these things. Not for a lack of trying - some of this was caused by trauma or other circumstances (for example I'm autistic which makes the social aspect of things hard) but I'm so saddened and embarrassed by myself.

            "You have until you die to get whatever you need to do done.\n\nDon't use that as an excuse to endlessly procrastinate, but absolutely use it as motivation to know that you can do just about anything at any age\n\nIronically, those people who believe that you should do certain things by certain ages aren't even accomplishing their own desires!

            "There are 2 basic questions in life that you need to answer for yourself, no one can answer them for you (though you may tell yourself and others later that others answered them for you).\n\n1) What do you want to do with your life?\n\n2) How are you going to pay your rent?\n\nQuestion one is nebulous and often will not remain the same throughout your life. Things change, your perspective changes, your believes and loves and passions change as part of the march of time. The thing that gives your soul joy, that is what you want to do with your life. Whether it's sit on the couch, smoking weed and playing video games ; becoming a CEO of a major company; joining a political cause; painting a masterpiece; climbing El Capitan every day, this is the thing that you feel in your heart of hearts is that which you need to do and makes you the most happy.\n\nQuestion 2 is more practical.  How are you going to get food/shelter/the supplies for continued existence.  Mostly dependant on question 1, this question is the ins and outs of how you will actually function. And the effort necessary to pay your rent depends on how nice you need/want to life. If you don't mind couch surfing, work something that pays a little and doesn't interfere with your personal life. If you want a Penthouse or Mansion, you're going to need to put in a little more effort.\n\nBy 25, you have gone to primary school. You've gotten at least the chance to see what you'll need to acquire (or what you need to do without) in order to survive. At this point, you don't need to have a firm grip on question 1 (some people never answer it), but you do need to have at least some plan for question 2. Ideally, take the time you have in which you don't have responsibilities and roll the dice. Travel. Meet people. Try a few jobs. Learn a language.  Don't live in comparison to how you think others are, meet these people and see what your life is like.\n\nBest of luck.",

Shut the fuck up and grunt, if there is a mirror look at them intensely while fucking them. But like an evil smile as if you are hunting a while boar with a spear, and the boar is cornered. \n\nAsk if you can shake them, squeeze the sides( fingers only, and gently), both the whole hand. \n\nEnsure your hands are manicures and as you are fucking massage their skin gently then harder in the good time.\n\nHelp them with the rhythm by holding their hip and ensuring their motion is in sync with yours. If they are squatting on your dick, put your hands on their cheeks or thighs and help them get up, so they don\u2019t, get as tired.\n\nThis is fucking amazing, thank you thank you thank you, as you are cumming. \n\nDid I say grunt, and moan, and breath loudly as if the board you were trying to hunt is now chasing your ass! \n\nDon\u2019t ask if they like it or if they came, just say how amazing it was, what you loved about it, the best moment for you, maybe ask what their best moment for them. \n\nAnd by god all mighty, as much as you want. Do not push them away, hug them, caress them, kiss them, and kiss their forehead, their hands.

Along with knowing how kinky your partner is and their boundaries.\n\nFor example, its simply:\n\n\"Be a good girl for me, make me __\" or \"you're such a dirty whore do __ for me\" \n\nIt's all about how you refer to them really. The rest of the dirty talk fills itself in.  Dont overcomplicate it.\n\nLearning how to moan is also the easy part bc you can just take a breath and let your voice make sound on exhale. Like when you crack your back or neck and it feels good it makes you groan, or when you moan from the release of tension from a massage. \n\nIt also helps to get out of your head about it being inappropriate or impolite. I really struggle with feeling like its okay for me to put my sexual energy on her plate, worrying about it being wrong or bad or that ill make a mistake. But i realized that saying my desires, urges and fantasies are just me being honest and that she desrves honesty which makes it less wrong. Although im still getting there. For some alter egos work but its difficult for me, which may be becuse im long distance rn but yeah, this is what I've learned and i hope it helps someone else out there!",

It\u2019s gonna harm them mentally and emotionally and push them farther down that route.\n\nEvery single group of people are capable of violence, and you need to call people out on their actions not inherent characteristics that that have no control over.",

If anyone\u2019s crossing roads or adding time to their walk taking detours it\u2019s the person who feels the situation is a problem. I shouldn\u2019t have to stand around in the cold, add 10 minutes wandering off in the wrong direction, or risk getting mugged down a back street to prove I\u2019m not a threat when the same proof will be present as she arrives unmolested by me at her destination.",

Could even choose a different path. But wouldn't be engaging in the reassurance rituals of obsessively fearful people. Assuage/allay fears fears, yes. Avoid triggering them, sure. Validate them?

I just don't think about the guy. Pretty sure the last thing I heard about him was when he was beefing with that Meek Mills dude. And before that, he was just the wheelchair kid from Degrassi TNG in my mind. I've thought about Drake like 3 times in my life.",

            "The USA's culture is so ubiquitous in most media, that many people assume that the US's racial issues are the same everywhere.  Even in Canada, many Canadian laws are written based on USA issues -- the US has mass shootings, Canada's liberals enact legislation to ban more types of guns, as though Canada's the same.  Similarly, Canadian minorities are treated as though they suffer the same sort of persecution as in the states, with things like black-promoting grants, bursaries and equity programs... even though Canada literally banned slavery before the country even fully formed, and it was the country that black slaves from the US would flee to in order to be treated fairly/gain freedom.  Canada never had a huge history of slavery -- in fact, banning it was mostly a response to americans trying to come north with slaves, and to curtail the practice of slavery amongst first nations.\n\nDrake was raised with basically a silver spoon as a privileged minority in a country without a history of slavery -- dude was a child star on degrassi ffs.  But, due to the dominance of american themes, he adopted the persona of a \"black man\" vis a vis the states' norm.  He was able to pass for so long as such, because who gives a f about canada?  The states's racism also likely helped, as any \"black person\" likely just gets thrown into the same category, with most people in the US seemingly unable to comprehend that other countries don't have the same brutal/explosive history of racism: one black guys the same as the next in many of their views.  Hell, even when you look at many of the people singing along to the song, they're like... prep school black kids now.... which aint the same as where that culture came from.",

When you start stepping on toes of your cohort, they can 'expose' you and shut down your brand. \n\nAnd people are dumb, like all humans. We all like to think we are not susceptible but we are. Especially if we dont question ourselves. So there are several issues at play with the brain that can keep people from seeing things or believing in things. Like investment bias, availability, recency, primacy huristics. Fact the the brain will retreat into safe knowns(knwons for the person) instead of admitting to itself that new infomation doesn't fit the world view. And thats how facts get rejected by most. These make propaganda, and advertising so effective, because if they get the brains early and frequently enough, eventually the information will set in, despite reality and facts. This is why its beliefs. Go to a more education society that polices thought, and you will see distrust, but also a lot more emphasis on facts, its better but still doesnt cure human condition.",

Who has came out and said he raped, assaulted, did weirdo stuff besides the internet crusaders who don't like Drake? Everything in the song is stuff from Twitter that he used to paint a narrative that he already saw people on the internet using and he amplified it and threw some lies in to spice it up. You can turn anything negative if you want to without context or if you just don't care for the person. This Kendrick V. Drake stuff sounds like Trump v Biden to me. Just false information, dick riding and ignorance, favorite artist bias and just casual listeners not knowing shit but heard something one time, from someone , formed a opinion and never let it go and then any new information confirms their bias even when it's just a lie. Hence this question being asked, by some casual passerby with no information who just follows the the one headline they saw and sunk their teeth in it. Like Drake or not do research and use your brain. Just cause someone DMs some doesn't mean shit or this or that. People need to remember they aren't famous or rich or in the music industry. Rules are different and  just because you don't know them doesn't mean the person is doing bad stuff. Why aren't y'all going at Rubi Rose? Lil Wayne, Usher, bowwow and countless other peoples were children or underage living with adults in the music industry as they were helping and guiding them etc. I don't see why everything Drake does is looked at as negative and weirdo when literally every single person in the industry does it but the masses are just ready to see him lose so they don't care.",
