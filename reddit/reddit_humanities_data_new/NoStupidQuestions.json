Why are third parties not part of the debate? What does the debate actually mean, anyway? There are lots of good questions! But, unfortunately,  it's often the *same* questions, and our users get tired of seeing them. \n\nAs we've done for past topics of interest, we're creating a megathread for your questions so that people interested in politics can  post questions and read answers, while people who want a respite from  politics can browse the rest of the sub. **Feel free to post your questions about politics in this thread!** \n\nAll top-level comments should be questions asked in good faith -  other comments and loaded questions will get removed. All the usual  rules of the sub remain in force here, so **be civil to each other** \\- you can disagree with someone's opinion, but don't make it personal.",

When there are multiple debates they don't necessarily stick with the same color, and yet it seems like the two candidates don't ever wear the same color. What's going on behind the scenes here?\n\nDo they bring two ties to the event and then the TV production people try to figure it out once they're there?",

If somebody smells like any combination of those it's pretty obvious what's happened, and the smell lingers in rooms too. If you can't place the smell or you don't know what something smells like, you won't smell it. You may also have a subpar sniffer so RIP",

            "When I was a kid and my dad was verbally abusing me in a restaurant, someone tried to step in. It didn\u2019t go well for him and he ended up leaving in frustration but I never forgot him. I didn\u2019t feel alone or crazy anymore. It was one of the few times in my life as a kid that I felt validated that my dad\u2019s treatment of me was not okay. So many other adults turned the other way, enabled my dad, or didn\u2019t believe me.\n\nI understand not putting yourself in danger, and it doesn\u2019t always work out or is appreciated. But in my case, I will never forget that guy as long as I live. It still means a huge deal to me that someone tried to protect me. And it gave me strength to get away from my dad eventually.",

            "Yes, I have. I watched two shitty parents use their baby and toddler like rag dolls trying to pose them for a photo. The toddler got frustrated and hit the baby. The dad walked right over and slapped the toddler across the face. He didn\u2019t even cry. \n\nI told them to not hit their fucking kids. They told me to shut up and mind my own business. I said no way, you don\u2019t hit kids, ever. I called them pieces of shit, they gathered their kids and left. I have never once regretted it, and I think of those babies often.",
            "I did once when I saw a woman physically abusing her son in a parking lot. I told her in no uncertain terms to stop hurting him and she did. I got her license plate number and called it in to the state child abuse hotline. They actually sent people out to check on the kids and called me back to let me know. \n\nI feel like not saying anything makes us all complicit.",
            "I remember this like yesterday. I was in a grocery store walking down the aisle toward a mom and a girl of about 3 in a cart. Suddenly she slapped the child in the face. I gasped and walked past them for a second. Then I turned back touched her arm and said quietly \"Please don't do that. I still have nightmares of my mother doing that to me.\" Then I walked away. (I was 40 btw.) I'm so proud of myself for saying something, and in a way it might have been received well.",
            "That\u2019s tough. My mother was verbally abusive to me but managed to keep it at home. I wish someone had stood up for me though. My dad was often away on business and never really saw how bad, and how physical, it could get. I think standing up to a mother like that would be a good reality check. Folks are watching and actively judging you and feeling sorry for your kid.",
            "be present, just like you were. the lady shamed herself when she realized she wasn't alone. but speaking up may lead to conflict and if you aren't ready to handle it, don't. just be present. you being there probably gave that kid the courage to speak. sometimes that's all you can do.",
            "I have done it twice. Once, a dad in a store was screaming at a little girl that she couldn't use the nearby bathroom as it was inconvenient to him. She was clearly desperate.  I offered to take her, pretending his concern was her entering alone. He was quite rude until I showed him my Deptartment of Social Services ID to \"show him I was trustworthy.\" He settled right down, and I took her in. \n\nAnother time, at a grocery, a mom was getting angry, shouting at and hitting her child. I just started a casual conversation with her about how hard it is to shop with kids, and it seemed her little one was tired and hungry.  She regulated herself and seemed calm when I left.",
            "I worked at a domestic violence program in the late 90s. I was told public confrontation could lead to worse abuse at home, not in public. As an abused child, I would have given anything to have had someone take my side even just once.",
            "I don\u2019t only because saying something in those situations has the tendency to make it worse for the kid once they get home. It\u2019s heartbreaking though."
