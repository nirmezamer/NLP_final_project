            "PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:\n\n**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think \"free speech\" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to \u201cjerk\u201d, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*\n\n**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*\n\n**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*\n\n**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**\n\n**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not \"lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub\". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*\n\n*This is a reminder to the readers.

It takes me a lot longer because I die much easier and kill much slower, but that's just my own stubbornness at this point, and there has been only 1 enemy so far that I think I couldn't have beaten on my own. Qone boss feels to me like you're fighting the camera more than it, and the endless effects and particles don't exactly help with visibility, but that's just one boss that probably would be a lot more manageable at appropriate levels. Everything so far has been manageable by just practicing",

            "Whenever he plays modern WoW raids, he lets himself get carried through NORMAL mode. He's just absolute trash at playing video games for someone who does it for a living and has this image of being hardcore at it.",
            "I think the DLC is balanced around summons. Summons pretty much feel like a core mechanic of elden ring and the reason a lot of its bosses are this difficult is because of them. I know people love doing the bosses solo, but I'm pretty sure fromsoft just wants you to use your summons\n\nOh also when summoning the spirit ashes the boss doesn't get more health or more damage or anything. The boss doesn't scale with these summons like player/npc summons, so it's clear the game is balanced around using them in every boss fight they're available to use",
            "The dlc assumes you are level 150 with a good build and even then it kicks youre ass on purpose. Dont try any of the first bosses before scardu level 5 and a decenr spirit ash level! Its meant as a \"you are starting at the bottom expiernce\"",
            "The dlc is fucking hard I will agree, but I have been getting by with no summons and minimum cheese. Two of the optional bosses took around 50 attempts each, and one necessitated me retooling a build. Yet, i would still say they weren't as bad a my first attempt at malenia, which had me quit and go to bed before beating her the next day. \n\nAlso, I feel like most people haven't maxed their tree fragments and are attempting a late game optional boss they stumbled on when they don't have their fragment levels at what it should be. Lord knows I did and it is why those attempts took as long as they did",
            "Serious question , how ? I hate grinding because I don\u2019t have time but I\u2019d like to try the game",
            "Haven\u2019t finished the DLC yet, but have fought a couple main bosses, and tbh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that much tougher than the base game unless you just don\u2019t engage with the DLCs profession mechanic.",
            "How?\n\nEverything is factual and can be proven with evidence.\n\nIt's not like I'm slandering the guy. \n\nThere is like 10 years worth of recorded evidence.\n\nWhat's so embarrassing?\n\nAlso you shouldn't be afraid to criticize someone just because they are bigger than you.\n\nSo long as what you are saying is facts.\n\nI stated that he's a rich man child larping as a based god gamer.\n\nWhen the reality is that he's lazy, has a massive and yet fragile ego, and cannot control his emotions.\n\nThe guy is pushing 40 and still baby raging and slapping himself in the face for dying in a videogame.\n\nIf the game doesn't matter in terms of achievements, than why does he practically self implode when things don't go exactly as he wants?\n\nIt's beyond pathetic, especially when he tries to downplay other peoples accomplishments and perception of it being fun. Oh no, his ego can't handle someone possibly being an actual god gamer or better than him. \n\nI mean even Kai Cenat and Travis Scott are better than him, I think Jynxi is also doing well, and XQC is going okay enough. \n\nAsmongoler on the other hand just refuses to interact with the game beyond a surface level. Which is a problem when the game is trying to get you to use all of your knowledge and tools to overcome the challenges.",
            "Oof who did he shit on?",
            "They absolutely are but the souls community being how they are refuse to use majority of the mechanics in their games as it\u2019s the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to play the game.\n\nNothing wrong with challenge runs but the game is design around players using summons, weapons, armour and leveling up their character. No other game or community I\u2019ve ever seen is as ass backwards and gatekeeping like the souls community",
            "Exactly this ! Almost every big boss has the ability to summon an NPC that is important to the storyline of SoTE (the merry band of Miquella followers) in a way where, in my opinion, they absolutely intend you to do it for story purposes. Just like how you could have Onion Boy with you for Yhorm. \n\nPlus the dlc places a big emphasis on those \"enhance summons\" collectibles to burn at sites of grace.",
            "I don't like how using summons absolutely fucks the AI and honestly makes it too easy, I wish there was a middle ground!",
            "It was the same for the base game. I didn't do margit until i beat a bunch of dungeons and overworld bossfights in limgrave, I'm doing the same for the dlc and it's been really fun cause the world is very dense with some really good content",
            "Magic builds are easier but still no cakewalk",
            "There\u2019s a lot of builds that make the game much easier, but there\u2019s still a learning curve and most of those builds require at least a little grinding to get going. If you want to give it a try start with an intelligence build and get the meteorite staff early, but honestly the best way to play is just exploring and getting stronger naturally. Grinding isn\u2019t necessary since there\u2019s so much to do. It\u2019s a huge game though, so if you don\u2019t have the time it might feel overwhelming in general. I played for a good hundred hours before seeing the final boss, so it\u2019s a bit of an investment time wise.",
            "The majority of the game's enemies are designed for a melee character. Using ranged magic makes things easier. Additionally, using co-op or NPC summons splits enemy agro, which also reduced difficulty. Lastly, the great thing about Elden Ring is that due to its open world, if you get stuck on a boss in one area, you can just try exploring somewhere else. Highly recommend you give it a shot.",
            "It's almost impossible to do the dlc without using those sacuda tree fragments honestly. That stuff would be insanely hard",
            "Extreme cringe\u00a0",
            "Yeah honestly while i have played through elden ring without summons for 3 playthroughs just cause i like the challenge, it's basically a challenge run. As you said it's the same as not using any of the other mechanics to make the game more difficult for yourself.",
            "For real tho, its not even for the damage negation aspect of it.\n\nA level 10 Somber weapon will do fuck all, even with the right build if you don't have scadutree blessings, which is wild to me.\n\nA fun addition for challenging fights for sure, though I'm kinda wondering how speedrunners will deal with it afterwards.",
            ">without using those sacuda tree fragments honestly. \n\nThat's why they're in the game. The same with levels, weapon upgrades, flask upgrades, ashes of war and yes, even spirit ashes in the base game.",

Orcs since the beginning have been savage mooks to kill, and it was up to the creator how much complexity you wanted to add to their society. Players being players wanted more options, so it made sense that some wanted to play as the mook race. Those players could go for or against type, which was fine, because they being the PCs are special inherently. A problem arose though, when making them a standard race like anything else, because once you start assigning the same intellectual and moral worth to the \"savage mook race\" everyone begins to think it looks pretty racist (justifiably so), so now they have to become functionally something other than the orcs they were in order to avoid that.\n\nIf I had my way, I think I'd return orcs to where they were. I think they were more valuable as mooks to kill in the fighting monsters game than they were as reskinned humans. This also dovetails into my personal dislike of \"Menagerie Parties\" where you have plasmoids, genasi, bug people, and no humans in the party. Especially when besides to point out how odd they are, they are essentially being played as mentally identical to humans. That's not to say that I'm entirely opposed to wacky races (in fact my most recent campaign I ran had a party that was at least Menagerie adjacent), it's just that it seems these races are being used as mental fortnite cosmetics rather than mattering for any other reason.",

Dwarves, Giants and Elves (There were also the Sky People and those that dwell in the sea, but they were rarely relevant). All of whom were made by the same four gods with a unique purpose in mind. They and their descendants were referered to as The Kin. Orcs were the result of an attempt at making super soldiers out of Goliaths (The Children of Dwarves and Giants), to aid fight a demonic threat. And humans were the result of centuries of interbreeding between Gnomes (Who were the children of elves and dwarves) and Orcs.\n\nThe Orcs were largely isolationist. After the Demon wars ended, they ended up being mostly supplanted and pushed out by humans, who both lived longer, were overall healthier and generally had more children, faster. So they ended up spreading out. Some moved to the holds of the dwarves, where they serve as elite soldiers. Many of whom are in well respected positions. Others live among the Gnomes, where they generally live peaceful lives. Helping with the rougher manual labor, and reaching stuff on the tall shelves. \n\nThere were also many who moved into more rough and barren terrain, where their strong constitution let them survive mostly unbothered by others. It was there most of the various Orc civilizations of today were founded. But they can also generally be found in most nations around the world. Through there are also a lot of orcs, especially among the older ones, who have a strong dislike towards the Dwarves and what remains of the Giants, as they feel they were crafted to be disposable soldiers. Who, while tough, were never meant to grow old or be a people. So they tend towards having a lot of health issues as they grow older, and have difficulties having children.",

            "A great deal of the problems with forgotten realms orc lore is that its in books and dnd players famously refuse to read. Orcs and half orcs have had a lot written about them, a people and culture tragically slaved to a pantheon to spiteful and self loathing to not in twine themselves in the daily lives of their worshippers.\n\nDragon magazine 275 has one of my favorite bits of dnd artwork by Mark zug, an orc paladin (a full blood orc not a half orc who get a weird pass) in full knightly attire with barded horse and squire kneeling in a sunny meadow passing a golden locket to their chest.\n\nIt felt like we had come a long way with how we thought and wrote about \"monstrous\" races in dnd being a product of their culture and society and not a genetic destiny but here we are 24 years later still having the same conversations :(\n\nLuv me orcs",
            "The only time I ran the orcs as stereotypical barbarians, I also had them be the victims of a Divinci Code level historical conspiracy by ancient elven secret societies, with the PCs as Kobolds who stumble across this secret while dealing with their own potential genocide.\n\nAlso, before now my favorite depiction of orcs in fiction was probably in the Dark Profit series of novels, satirical stories that frame all the driving forces of adventuring & villainy in terms of economics & class, where they have embraced The Way of the Sale to survive and are merchants who are hardcore into \u201chow can I get you into this car today\u201d level aggressive salesmanship. \ud83d\ude01",
            "Hey this is a bit out there but there's a kinda old-school dnd adjacent blog called goblin punch. They have a really cool write-up about orc society, they're the stereotypical 'evil' race still but there are genuine reasons and cultural nuance it's really neat. It's just called \"God Hates Orcs\" and from what you just said you might like it.",

            "Yeah look, i'll give you the women thing 100%. I don't play orc or draenei women because they look like some sweaty nerd's fantasy of a 'monster girl'. But I have in the past read the books as I'm a huge fan of Christie Golden as a writer and she gives the orcs a beautiful monstrous heritage and life, so I do feel a little defensive here. And when I think of warcraft orcs, I don't think of the vanilla green human woman. \n\nBut yes, early world of warcraft monster women suffer greatly from 'human woman with green skin' syndrome. This is something they've somewhat rectified with newer races but the damage is done.",

            "Honestly, the biggest mistake TTRPGs ever made was to have a human race in them. Nobody plays Joe Shmoe humans in VTM, for example, because then there are a bunch of options that aren't \"just like me fr\".\n\nThis is probably a hot take most people will disagree with, but the fact that so many people gravitate to playing humans in stuff like DND and PF is so boring, imo. There's all this variety, all these options and people not only ignore a lot of those options, they act like wanting to play something that isn't just \"me in wizard robes\" is somehow cringe. The whole point is to play as somebody you aren't!",

            "Except lore-wise DnD Orcs *do* have complex societies and motivations as a race, they have a complex religion and segment of the pantheon, widespread political agreements between tribes, and systems of art/writing. The *only* thing changed is doing away with the concept that all members of some sapient races think/act with a specific moral alignment, which just makes things more interesting.",

            "The issue is, if you have a creature with free will, but then hand wave away that free will and say \u201cthis creature will always do this\u201d, it\u2019s not very compelling for a character. But allowing sentient creatures a diverse array of morality and decision making doesn\u2019t \u201chumanize\u201d them, even dolphins and primates have the cognitive ability to make decisions and do \u201cgood\u201d things with their fellows or \u201cbad\u201d, and have the basic understanding to make that choice within their own societies with potential punishment if they act too immorally to beings they identify with. It may not be moral to a human\u2019s understanding, but every ape isn\u2019t just raping and murdering other primates 24/7, (even though they still do so a surprising amount). Unless they are of a hive mind species, it is illogical for millions of sentient beings to be of identical mind and conscience.",
            "Rather than \"good\" or \"bad,\" \"proper\" and \"improper\" are likely better words for this. They can have a hierarchical system that guides behavior and social animals can conceive of others within their social system as members of an in-group, sure.\n\nAs you point out, though, that doesn't mean its moral to a human's understanding. In fact, their structure of correct behavior may be driven by a stricter hierarchy and also create such divides between in and out-groups that we would find their behavior inherently immoral, ourselves; in other words they may be, by nature, so opposed to our system of morality that we would find them inherently evil. That's what alignment is, at least in the absence of Gods. Adding in higher powers and you have a completely different variable that I actually think is quite important.\n\nRemoving that and applying the same system of behavior we use makes them more human."
