I pay at conbini so not on my bank account transactions, can't find proof I paid it, can't connect to the kepco, can't contact support since it's weekend. \n\nI received a SMS which I assume is a scam from supposedly \"Tokyo Electricity Power1\" about unpaid bills, but maybe the Kansai And Tokyo EP companies have a connection together and it's legit? I stupidly tried to pay, but website said it failed. Website seemed to be the legit TEPCO site, but payment was in HKD, number who sent the message is +63.\n\nI have no idea how to deal with this situation, has this type of stuff happened to anyone before?

But the staff are usually pretty nice and if you ask them to make it extra spicy or to make it spicy like how Indian people eat it, they will hook you up. A few times I've asked that and they took it as a challenge and really spiced it up. I had to eat it slowly. The guy came over a few times to ask if it was okay and through my runny nose I smiled and said it was delicious. Dude was happy that I finished everything too, haha.",

Personally, I like Rakuten because I don't have to mess around with data packages. I just use as much data as I want and I get charged accordingly. But with the others you could get a lower monthly amount if you buy the smallest package and stay within that limit.",

I'd do so, just in case.",

First, Some chicken breasts saut\u00e9 (in butter) with garlic and shiitake and small cherry tomatoes (and of course Himalayan pink salt and black pepper). Then you do another saut\u00e9 with Zukini and eggplant (butter too). In a plate, you lay down your green salad, then you add avocado slices, fried onion crusts (you can buy it), and add some olive oil.\n\nThen, you put the zukini/eggplant saut\u00e9 on top, then the chicken/garlic/shiitake/tomatoes, and finish it with some balsamic cream vinegar cream and some chips of parmesan cheese (real one, not powder). You can add walnuts (and a boiled egg) if you like it.\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kso3md5b9u7d1.jpeg?width=1774&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b570510588c05ffe2197b8539016b6ed564aba",

I collected the tsuchikabe and put it in a tub outside to rehydrate and ferment--they skipped the fermentation step when they did it the first time, so the straw wasn't well-integrated.\n\n\nAfter five months of waiting and continuous naysaying/tooth-sucking by the neighbors, the recycled tsuchikabe is a perfect consistency and I can finally put it back up. It's really easy to work with and it's sturdier than expected when dry. Very happy that upstairs is starting to resemble a human habitation again.",

Amazing! \n\nAlso my gym very swiftly fixed the mozzie issue (that I complained about last night) and sent me a DM to inform me! Yippie! Cleaned so much today in prep for FFXIV expansion next week.

            "The elementary school English teacher called in an advisor teacher to help her manage the classes (she\u2019s just insane, the kids are actually pretty well behaved but behaving worse for her lately because she is mean. And no I\u2019m not just saying this I\u2019ve taught these kids for three years they are way better behaved than they used to be and behave themselves for me lol). This teacher has spent the past year INSISTING the kids write katakana above every single word. I keep telling her the students don\u2019t need it, but she\u2019s SO WORRIED the kids will forget and we won\u2019t be able to stick to whatever schedule she made. It was also just a huge waste of time to make the kids write katakana above every word instead of, ya know, just practicing the English. \n\nTHANKFULLY, the advisor teacher told her to cut it out so this week she made an announcement to all the classes telling them to erase their katakana unless they really don\u2019t know the word. Many kids happily erased their katakana (and I am proud of them). Now just have to hope the advisor teacher sees her asking the kids questions about their speeches using way too difficult grammar and speaking way too fast. She may be insane but at least she will listen to the advisor teacher.",

I know it's the bare minimum, but having a partner who actually listens and apologizes for what they've done is so... nice.

            "There\u2019s various choices\n\n- if you\u2019re looking for something casual, there\u2019s FB hiking groups where people often drop in and out as they like. Be warned that I\u2019ve heard some of them can be a bit\u2026 predatory.\n\n- If you\u2019re after something a bit more structured, you may try looking for a local \u5c71\u5cb3\u4f1a. The issue with these is they tend to skew a bit older and the amount of effort people put into them can vary widely.\n\n- My recommendation if you\u2019ve got a bit of spare cash is to try one of the Mont Bell trips. These cost a bit, but you can choose women-only groups if you like and they tend to be on the younger side. You can also \u201cgrade up\u201d to more difficult hikes at your own pace.\u00a0https://event.montbell.jp/sp/plan/?cid=4",

The ER doctors called in a gynecologist who did further tests (ultrasound and echo). She told me my ovary has swelled a bit with a cyst (size is around 6 now) but it looks benign. However I have to get an MRI and surgery is recommended to prevent a twist. \n\nThat\u2019s all they could do in the ER (although the whole thing went pretty fast and effective) so now I need to get a \u7d39\u4ecb\u72b6\u3000from my gynecologist to a big hospital for MRI. I\u2019m planning to be referred to the same hospital that did the ER exams and CT scans since I already have medical records there. \n\nI also have long covid, orthostatic tachycardia, chronic fatigue syndrome due to long covid and two weeks ago I had a vertigo attack. My health situation is out of whack. I have obaachan levels of physical strength. But I\u2019m hanging on and hopeful. \n\nIf anyone had an ovarian cyst removal, I\u2019d like to hear about your experience. Emotional support is welcome. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "can't help with any ovarian cyst removal experience of my own but sounds like you are on the way to recovery. Recovery seldom follows the timeline we would like but stamina is something that is built up with small persistent efforts as well as big ones. Once you get a  complete blood workup done there maybe things in it that can guide you in dealing with your other issues regarding nutrition. Non doc advice here is to work on your gut health and then go from there. \n\nStay positive and best wishes sent."
