It's honestly not a surprise that they're so popular since they took those sub genres and decided to water it and dilute it down for a Tiktok audience. ",

Maybe I just have a boomer mindset, but streaming should not be considered a \u201cjob\u201d. YouTube is more understandable, as that can take skill and hard work in terms of editing, communication etc. These streamers should not be getting paid thousands/ millions and a select few making more than some professional athletes for just whining about the game they are playing and reading a chat log for 6- 12 hrs, I just don\u2019t see the value at all compared to YouTube or other entertainment. That\u2019s just my opinion tho, what y\u2019all think? \n",

            "What is considered a job isn't dependent on societal value it's dependent on whether or not someone is willing to pay you to do it.",
            "I mean they make money legally therefore it's obviously a job. People give them money of their own free will. There are lots of things I find incredibly boring or cringe that earn money, like reality tv or those shows were they humiliate people for singing badly, as long as there is a demand they will make money",
            "Y'watch sports? Same thing.",
            "\"i don't find this form of entertainment entertaining so people providing it should not be paid.\"\n\nwhat if i told you that i find football (soccer for my american friends) mind numbingly boring? does that mean that footballers don't deserve to be paid as much as they are? or, you know, there are people who dislike most movies. should actors not be paid?\n\nwho made you the arbiter of what is or isn't valuable entertainment?",
            "You underestimate the profits to be made from catering to the lowest common denominator.",
            "I think 99% of streamers on twitch don't make very much money. But if you are a boomer who still has enough time to watch Twitch and Youtube streamers regularly while playing games yourself, just enjoy the show. Appreciate that we have come far enough to allow some people to live off of providing entertainment to others, even if you yourself find it boring.",
            "Truly an unpopular opinion. Different streamers are watched by different people for different reasons. Those people are donating them their own money. For whatever reason. But most probably, because they just like them. I can say the same thing about why certain famous football players have millions for kicking the ball.",
            "You\u2019re focused only on the big name streamers who make tons of money.  99% of streamers do not make that kind of money. In fact, most don\u2019t make enough to survive off their earnings to stream fulltime.  \n\nIn addition, those streamers making millions often are able to do so because they\u2019re supplementing the streaming income with ad revenue and a YouTube channel where they post clips and similar. So it\u2019s a hybrid system! It\u2019s *very* rare for a streamer to make the big bucks exclusively streaming. That\u2019s the 1% of the 1% basically.",
            "People who invest their time and effort into something, should be rewarded for their effort. Sounds like your problem is more so that other occupations dont get payed enough, not that streamers get paid.",
            "Sometimes it's fun to (kinda half) watch someone play who is way better at a game than I am.\n\u00a0And for certain events like WoW competitions, the official stream can get tiresome, and there are 'watch parties' with the (often professional) players giving their commentary.\u00a0\n\n\nBut yes it can also be a cesspool.",
            "I mean professional TV has shit like Vanderbilt restaurant where a bunch of shallow wanna be actors parade around being stupid. Jersey Shore had a bunch of idiots being themselves for a pay check. I'll take the streamers.\u00a0",
            "I don't agree with most of what you wrote, but Twitch streaming really does suck. 99% of the content is just awful. The 1% is also not really that good. But if people want to fork over money for that, sure.",
            "Definitely a boomer mindset, streaming should absolutely be considered a job because it\u2019s just like any other job in the entertainment industry. You might not find it entertaining but plenty of others do and they are willing to pay for it.",
            "Anything that earns money legally is a job.  \nThese people are paid as much as they are because of how ad revenue works in addition to the fact that people pay them directly. You may not see value in it or may not like what people do but others clearly do. Not to mention that not all streams are gaming content.",
            "It's a free market and these ppl have created value which ppl are willing to pay for entirely by choice, therefore streamers *do* deserve to get paid exactly as much as they receive.",
            "They don't get paid as good as you assume. Common misinformation makes you think that they're filthy rich. Just having 1000 views puts you in the 99th percentile of streaming, and that equates to a couple hundred a month if consistent. Those that pander to children and drama are borderline sociopaths make more money off sponsorships, and ads even with their 99.99th percentile viewership.\n\nSame thing with basically all forms of social media/content. Only the top 1% of creators make a liveable wage. Reality is, content creation (Youtube, Tiktok, Instagram, Twitch, Onlyfans) for the vast majority of people are not good career options. We just see the successful ones due to survivorship bias.",
            "If it makes you money it\u2019s a job. Whether you like it or not. It provides a form of entertainment for people so who cares. Most people don\u2019t want to work a standard, life draining job.",
            "This is a solid unpopular opinion. Thank you!\n\nThat being said, if people willingly pay you do it, then you deserve what you earn. Sounds like YOU just don\u2019t get it (neither do I, but I\u2019m not jealous \ud83d\ude09)",
            "I have never donated to any streamer yet I watched quite a lot of the content. Nobody is forced to donate, it's free content. \n\nSo I'm pretty sure that those who are donating are not starving and \"giving away their hard earned money\". Besides, if you have Amazon prime, subs are free.\n\nJust say that you hate your job. Jealousy is not a good thing.",
            "I stream on Twitch and get around 70 viewers. I love it, and have made some awesome friends along the way. I also get a little extra cash, which is nice. People watch Twitch to hang out with chat and watch a game they like. Frankly, this is a weird thing to be angry about. I'm just enjoying myself over here.",
            "99% of all streamers can't even live off of their streams. What you're seeing is maybe the top 1%. Being able to entertain thousands of people for hours a day is a skill. Otherwise everyone could just stream and make a living out of it. But that isn't the case.\n\nEntertainment is subjective. Some people feel entertained by Zack Synder or Michael Bay movies. I can't understand that either.\n\nAt least most streamer get rich without exploiting other people like almost every super rich person on this planet.",
            "I used to think streaming was pretty stupid as well. Why would you watch someone play a game when you could just play it yourself?\n\nThen I got into playing chess and League of Legends. And I realized it can be both fun and instructive to watch someone play who\u2019s one of the top players in the world. You have to understand the game well enough to recognize just how good they are.\n\nI don\u2019t donate, but I do use my free twitch prime sub to help out the streamer who I watch the most. It costs me nothing, they get $5, and hopefully it\u2019ll allow them to continue creating content.",
            "yes, what's next?",
            "It's probably a bubble.  Most of the genuine streamers have all aged and settled in their place.  These new ones are just doing what they think will make them the most cash. \n\n  \nI think even twitch considers it a loss, hence why they keep fiddling around with monetisation.\n\n  \nStreaming seems lucrative until you realise you're relying on them for stability.  Twitch closes shop, then what happens?  The real smart ones are the ones that get in, cash out, make money elsewhere, and then continue streaming for fun and to promote their other stuff.\n\n  \nIt's a legit business, you really just need to look at how it works.",
            "You just figure this out?\n\nThere are many worse people that are paid much more. A vast array of people actively damage society and fet paid for it.\n\nE.g. crypto scammers.",
            "They only get paid if people want to pay them or watch them, meaning they for sure deserve it. \n\n\nTry streaming, I bet then you'll see very quickly how hard and exhausting it actually is to be live on camera and keep people watching for hours at a time.   There's a reason something like 1 out of 10k streamers make partner status",
            "They make millions thanks to sponsors more than by subs. When they get paid 20.000$ to play a mobile game for 1 hour they already are making more than all the subscription they will get for the month. And they do multiple sponsor per months, sometimes 5-6 per weeks. Same for ads. Make sense right, if you are a promoter of a video game and you want people to buy it, you want a place where 100% of the viewer can potentially be interested. Twitch. Meanwhile ads spot on tv, you will often have a lot of viewers that are not your target audience at all.\n\nSo they pay streamers millions because the promoter also make millions thanks to that. It's quite simple really. \n\nAlso you only a very small fraction of twitch streamers are making millions, just like onlyfans. The other struggle daily to reach the top percentages.\n\nIn the end, it's entertainment and if you watch a streamer for dozen of hours per week, is it a big deal to give them some money here and there ? Feels like good value to me.",
            "\n\nEntertainment is not the only draw to twitch\n\n\nAlot of people watch twitch as a \"hang out\" because they don't have friend groups that play the game they are interested in.\n\n\nThen there's the egirls. Alot of guys out there have very little interaction irl with the opposite sex.",
            "Almost all of the skills that go into making a video for a place like YouTube are needed to live stream. Big difference is that the creator is doing it all in the moment instead of being able to record many takes and edit the final version. The viewers are seeing it all as it happens. \n\nAs for pay, very few make much of anything and many don't get any money at all. A very small number of content creators make anything even close to being able to not have other income to survive. Most are doing it for fun and if they do receive some money are very grateful for it.",
            "I think it's all dependent. \n\nIf the steamer is a gamer, are they coaching/taking time to explain how to get better at the game? I'd say that's good.\n\nBut there are definitely terrible streamers that make a shit ton. Like I'm sorry but watching these NPC streamers makes me want to kill myself. These people are getting paid money to do random actions and act like a video game npc. It's cringe as hell.",
            "While I agree that streamers such as Asmongold are disgustingly overpaid, there's the vast majority of streamers that will never profit off of the content they create. That's because they have no viewership. Why do 30k - 400k people jump on Twitch all at once? Asmongold started streaming. Having a large audience is very valuable to a service that relies on ad revenue. If you can offer what Twitch needs (viewers) I don't see why you wouldn't be paid for that. It's a mutually beneficial relationship for the streamer, Twitch, and the tens of thousands of people who get free content out of it.",
            "I've never watched Twitch streamers but I could see some potential for it. \n\nFrom what I gather though it's not living up to its potential.",
            "I think this is a stupid opinion.\n\nNo different than professional athletes or actors, they create or even just see the product that generates a bunch of money, why wouldn\u2019t the people who the industry is built on receive their share of that money?\n\nYou\u2019re acting like streaming is a cushy government job or something. They\u2019re not getting paid with your tax dollars, the streaming industry generates that money. Whether you think it\u2019s valuable or whatever dumb shit doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd 99% of streamers don\u2019t make a significant amount of money at all anyways. It\u2019s only the select few that can command a significant audience that get paid well anyways, the average is realistically almost nothing.",
            "I don't like it, but similar things can be said about the entertainment industry as a whole. It has the value we give it as a society. I also think some people can spread their legs on only fans and make banks while some work 40+ hour weeks, not counting prep and transport times.",
            "In addition to all that's been already said... If it was that easy to make thousands or millions with streaming, we'd all be doing it I think.\n\nLike any other entrepreneurial adventure, it's probably not as easy, quick and simple as it looks t be successful.",
            "\"Deserve\" is an odd choice of perspective.\n\nThey make content. People willingly donate. They're not entitled to it, but they aren't demanding it or taking advantage of anyone.",
            "I don\u2019t like when streamers act like they\u2019re actually working.  Or that it\u2019s hard to be a streamer \n\nAlso, I really hate how much influence they have. They\u2019re all so fucking annoying.",
            "I never thought I would defend streamers, but some of them are the number one players in the world, and some games take a ton much time to be that good. If I was that good I would be streaming too.",
            "They are compensating someone for their time and effort, because the watcher has fun... I think it's just polite to be grateful.\n\n*edit: and you're free to decide if and how much you wanna spend and watch.",
            "This is what an unaware jealous person sounds like then?",
            "People are willing to reward someone for something they find entertaining even if it seems to be the dumbest shit ever to you. Someone finds value in it, so be it. If it's not predatory or dangerous or overly intrusive and unavoidable, I don't care.",
            "Yes, I prefer YouTube live streams. Can even be a 4K stream, the UI is better and the streamers aren't so crappy.",
            "You try and play games for 6 hours while being mildly entertaining, while engaging with your chat. It\u2019s not easy. You need the charisma and personality to make it happen",
            "Yes, but also its really funny that if you stream on Twitch which is free to watch and make millions from voluntary donations which basically means you work for tips, you get more shit for making the money than if you had put your content behind a paywall with no option to watch for free and made your millions that way.",
            "You don't have to play them but people choose to do because they provide them something of value.",
            "You say 99% of streamers are boring. But then say they make millions. That 1% are the ones that aren't boring and get paid good money. Everypne else is being silent to their 14 viewers",
            "I found that most people who are addicted to streamers also have low self esteem/ depression issues. It's probably getting worse as their obsession grows. Loving by procuration through the mundane life of the average Joe/Jane, that's a whole level of pathetic here.\n\nGet help.",
            "They are selling a product, and it happens to be a product that many people want to buy. I don't watch many Twitch streamers(other than Critical Role), but I find it way more interesting than most sports, and so I would rather give them my money than some overpaid football player. Different strokes for different folks.",
            "Lol, guess who's angry they're not a streamer rolling on cash",
            "This is the most popular opinion about streamers ever. Comparing it to YouTube is silly, every YouTuber and every streamer put varying levels of time and effort into their content. To say one is more than the other shows you have an uninformed opinion.",
            "I think you\u2019re underestimating streaming being a skill. Turn on a camera and talk for 8 hours and then watch it. I\u2019m sure it will be more boring than who you consider to be boring. If not, start streaming. 99% of twitch streamers are making crumbs.\n\nI\u2019m curious if you can name a few streamers making millions who you consider to be boring so we know your boring scale.\n\nSuccessful YouTubers typically pay someone to do their editing and some even have a whole crew behind the camera.",
            "lol it\u2019s harder than you think. These people grinded to get consistently 1k plus views to be able to live on their own",
            "Well sadly for you, that's just how the world works. Supply and demand. And there's a a lot of people with internet connected devices with time to kill. If you think it's easy and takes no skill or hard work you're free to take a shot at it.",
            "Well how about giving jobs to those younglings? Because right now boomer is still controlling the job market",
            "My monthly prime sub goes straight to kitboga. Mans doing the lords work.",
            "I disagree. Twitch takes a portion of their income. Its something like 70 or 60 % goes to the streamer and twitch pockets the rest. \n\nHeres how you need to see this properly translated to understand it. \n\nTwitch = TV. With TV you tune into different channels and watch various shows. Reality shows became big and all kinds of themes around them made money. Not all of them made money though. Many shows and concepts lose money and a certain smaller % remain for multiple seasons etc. \n\nSo too with twitch, people are tuning into different channels. Twitch also has a \u201cguide\u201d just like the ol TV guide except its categories like games or irl stuff etc. within that space you have vast majority just trying to make it. Long is the list in any game category the streamers with less than 5 people, shoot alot have 0! So its not some easy thing. Those gross amounts of money come from people handing their money over. Like it or not people are going to hand their money over and that thing will either attract more money or not. I think they deserve it. Like I said, becoming one of those big streamers is up there with trying to become a professional athlete.",
            "No, people deserve to be paid whatever they were paid. $100 tip for pizza delivery, streaming, or whatever is money earned fair and square.\n\nHowever, the logic behind throwing out $100 for pizza or a stream can be examined as much as you'd like.",
            "I honestly just learned what Twitch is and I cannot believe the Earth can support that many mouth-breathing dweebs",
            "I don't get the appeal of dozens of people trying to get someone's attention as they play a game \n\nEvery comment is someone desperate to make a funny zinger or a pushy person demanding to be acknowledged or some tool going \"fun fact: water is wet\" like they're profound \n\nAnd the twitch streamer can't even enjoy the game because they have to look away from the screen to a wall of text to go thanks so and so for the donation \n\nPeople enjoy this? \n\nHonestly the only person I can see enjoying it is a lonely kid who'd never experienced having actual friends",
            "The reason why people donate is to show some form of appreciation,there's this streamer that they like,they get hours of entertainment from,so they give them a tip.",
            "If you don't think it takes serious skill to be consistently entertaining on a live video format I don't know what else to say.",
            "Ok, boomer",

            "Streaners only make money is peope watch then. \n\nMake everyone stop watching them. Then, it will not be a thing.",
            "Twitch would be tolerable if they removed all notification sounds and sub noises",
            "It's the same as any other entertainment- you watch it either because you like the game and want to see other people enjoying the things you enjoy, or else you like the spin that the entertainer puts on the game. Yes, 99% of streamers are bad, but that's Sturgeon's Law in a nutshell- 99% of everything is garbage, you find the few that are actually entertaining and watch/read/play/wank to the good stuff.\n\nThere's also the streamer having a Discord, chatrooms, their own website, and there's a whole actual set of communities you can find in there, but I'll bet you're just looking at the horny lonely dudes watching girls with their cleavage out playing games or the people watching the same guy \"react\" to videos for eight hours a day.",
            "I think it\u2019s crazy that people can make the kind of money that some do doing what they do, like twitch and instagram etc. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that some of it is because companies have big advertising budgets that they don\u2019t spent on tv commercials anymore so they\u2019re throwing it around trying to figure out and keep up with what works now.  \n\nBut with twitch etc, I don\u2019t get it.  I\u2019ve heard so many stories (that I believe a very small percentage of but still add up) about people buying things for & donating to creators who are obviously in a higher tax bracket than they are.   I don\u2019t mind supporting people who make stuff I like, but we\u2019re talking about me doing the odd buy me a coffee etc, not buying them something that I\u2019d never splurge on for myself.",

            "I disagree on the notion that streamers only complain or read chat for 6-12 hours and that is it and then they somehow make a living. Nah. Real streamers who make a living off of twitch streaming are people who are either extraordinarily good at a game they play, maybe are really good at IRL related content or figured out how to be engaging and entertaining for several hours a day with no break. That's an essential and severely underestimated skill and requirement to actually make it anywhere online and its not as easy as people make it seem. We see the success stories today that make it seem so easy but its not. The 99% of streamers you think are boring is because they are. The rest are genuinely entertaining people though that earn their money fair and square. To have like 10.000 viewers regularly, you have to be good at what you're doing and be entertaining!",

You had to see what the school program (or teacher) wanted you to see, else you would get a bad grade.\n\nHeck, in the final exam we had to write a reasoning essay, the theme was \"can a person always choose and is he responsible for his actions\". You had to reference a novel that was in the school program, else you will fail the exam. So you could reference your life, academic literature, philosophy books, but if you don't reference at least one novel that you had to read as part of the school programm (which were 90% about village life and suffering) - you would automatically fail. And if you fail that exam you don't get the certificate that you have finished school, so you can't go to university or other places where finishing school is required.\n\nSo we kinda weren't taught to think critically on our own. Instead we were taught to say what the teacher/examiner wanted to hear.

            "I think for about 99.9% of people that's what it is. Do i like to feel like shit? Of course not. Do i like to lay in bed with the lights off and feel justified for it? Definitely.",
            "Yep. I think it\u2019s a mental health thing. Because everything else is secondary to getting rest and feeling better.",
            "This is it here.  Plus, it's the only time I can ever get anyone else in my family to look after making meals.",
            "100% me",
            "Being ill provides a different kind of relaxation tho.\n\nI'm still relaxed and having a good time when I'm out with friends, staying up late etc.\n\nBut being ill in bed watching movies and cartoons let's me relax in a different kind of way y'know?",
            "See, when you put it like that it sounds bad",
            "This is me",
            "Or being sick turns off your mind finally and lets you be present\u00a0",
            "Ah shit you may be right. Sometimes I find myself missing the feeling of being sick when it's been a while. Once I'm sick again I always regret it because being sick sucks. But I think this is it.",
            "This is the popular opinion.",
            "Especially with the blocked nose bruh, it ain't even the worst but man we all think man I wish my nose wasn't blocked and we all think how we take our free nose for granted.",
            "Reddit commenter final boss",
            "Feel better soon",
            "Imagine having responsibilities. Being an adult sucks, huh?",
            "I feel ya, I have Covid and my fever of 101 degrees finally just broke after 2.5 days, and I still have many days in front of me to get better. Fuuuuuck being sick.",
            "Covid? That cough is a killer. I got the point where I thought I was gonna throw up all the time, but I never did. I was just coughing and coughing. And no, I did not enjoy it.",
            "That is strange for me. I've never ever had fever dreams during my fever periods, I struggle falling sleep and I only dream in black.",
            "I had pneumonia in 6th grade\u2026 I fell asleep in my parents\u2019 bed while watching a movie or something with my sister. I woke up from a fever dream in a delirium, convinced entirely that I needed to go back to my bedroom to save her life, so I did. Felt like I was the greatest brother ever lol.",
            "Hope you\u2019re ok now. In the past I\u2019ve been in for acute pancreatitis and they gave me morphine for a week, really enjoyed it.",
            "you are so right. fevers are amazing, I only have one thought at the same time, every time I turn my head the world becomes a haze like I\u2019m drunk, I feel heavy and tired all the time and thus I\u2019m capable of getting unlimited naps in and STILL feel tired at night!!\n\nrunny noses were made by satan though I\u2019m sure of it. terrible experience that makes me painfully aware of the lack of tissues in my home",
            "Can't. I mean, you can, but he isn't around to hear it.",
            "I\u2019m borderline chronic strep, I get it a few times a year. I love getting it. I love having a fever. The sore throat part is unpleasant but tolerable for me. I love the chills and the shivering. I love how I feel like I\u2019m freezing but when an object touches my body it somehow feels a lot colder than it normally would (bc fever is throwing off my heat perception). I like being dramatic and whiny and feeling sorry for myself. I love how my whole body aches. And I love the way I get to feel sorry for myself and lay in bed all day with unlimited sleep. I\u2019m happy when I start to feel the first tell tale signs of getting sick. I know I\u2019m insane.",
            "I mean, one day you will.\u00a0",
            "SOUP too",
            "Yes!",
            "Same",
            "I get it. I like being active, its how my brain works. Cleaning or yard work genuinely relaxes me. And I do, guilt free, have lazy nights where I eat junk and watch a 3 hrs of tv. But being sick forces me to stay in bed all day, have someone take care of me, and watch cartoons and movies all day. I esp like old movies when I\u2019m sick. And ill just eat  soup and ice cream. Makes me feel like a kid again. I dont really have the attention span or desire to do that without being forced. So its like a little treat/brain vacation.",
            ">But being ill in bed watching movies and cartoons let's me relax in a different kind of way y'know\n\nThe point is that you should be able to do all that without being ill",
            "I feel called out /s\ud83d\ude02",
            "![gif](giphy|eH4O6F2Drxa8SE5hor|downsized)",
            "It really does",
            "I'm making my way back. It's a low point.",
            "I'm going to go ahead and say that you enjoyed being high, not being sick.\n\nAlso, who the fuck enjoys having pancreatitis? That shit hurts like a motherfucker.",
            "Aids will do that bruh",
            "I mean I could? But I would rather do shit which allows me to be active and social. Being sick gives me an opportunity to be kinda lazy. That's not too say that like I don't ever just chill like that when I'm healthy, but idk being sick is just different since it serves as the perfect chance.",
