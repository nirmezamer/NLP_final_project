I've put together a list of some of the most common questions along with answers.\n\nI've tried to keep the answers as objective as possible. My own thoughts are in there but they're based on direct experience and combined with the feedback those posts typically get from the more experienced designers here as well as people from outside the forum (those I know personally and others who write about design or talk about it in videos or podcasts).\n\nIf you're new to this sub and to Graphic Design, I hope you find this helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need to know how to draw to be a designer?**\n\nNo. Graphic Design isn't art/drawing/illustration. Both disciplines are related but the majority of designers are not especially skilled at drawing. However, many designers will do rough sketches to work out designs such as logos, brochures, and advertisements. Small, simple sketches are called thumbnails while more refined sketches are called comps (short for comprehensive). These are usually not shown to the client, though including some of these process pieces in a portfolio can be helpful in demonstrating a designer's work process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I like to draw. Does that mean I'll be good at Graphic Design?**\n\nIt's a common misconception for people developing a new interest in visual arts to think of design as they think of creating a drawing or illustration for themselves. This is not the case. While designers do employ creativity, they do it at the service of a strategic requirement and they often must design according to existing brand guidelines \u2013 a set of rules on how the brand can and can't be expressed. This is the difference between Fine Art and the Applied Arts.\n\nFine Art is creating a piece for oneself with no outside requirements or restrictions, with the intent to sell the finished piece to a customer. A painter who conceives of a painting, paints it, and then sells it through an art gallery, website, or at a craft fair is working as a Fine Artist.\n\nApplied Arts like Graphic Design solve problems for clients (typically visual problems), making it less an art and more a craft. Consider the difference between a musician writing their own album vs. composing a commercial jingle or movie score, a filmmaker writing a script and shooting a short film vs. being hired to shoot an infomercial, or a writer composing a novel vs. being hired to write a company's ad or brochure. A Graphic Designer is similar to the latter in each case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Am I suited to be a graphic designer?**\n\nIt's difficult to answer this without knowing someone personally. However, if you're the kind of person who notices small details about visuals like the way a sign or flyer is printed, times when color combinations do and don't work well, or a small visual pun in a logo, you're more likely to be successful in a career like Graphic Design.\n\nThe ability to work alone for long periods of time, focusing on small elements or modifications that most others may not ever notice consciously, is another quality that's helpful to working as a designer.\n\nBeing critical of your work and growing the ability to evaluate it as objectively as possible is a necessary skill for someone working in this field. And the ability to listen to feedback and decide what changes to make to your work (if any) based on that feedback is another valuable skill for a designer, and one that grows by necessity as a person continues to work in the field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What software do I need to be a designer?**\n\nAlmost all working designers use Adobe products. Affinity, Canva, GiMP, Inkscape, and other free or low-cost design software is not commonly used by most working designers, especially those at agencies or in-house at companies. Adobe has over 95% market share in the field of Graphic Design. Non-Adobe software is mostly used by design students and hobbyists who do not need to regularly interface with other designers, vendors (like print shops), or clients. (One exception is Figma, a prototyping tool that many UI/UX Designers prefer over Adobe XD. Another is Apple Final Cut which competes with Adobe Premiere.) Learning to use free/low cost software is better than using nothing at all; however, those looking to get hired as designers will most likely need to learn to use Adobe software before being considered for full time design positions.\n\nCurrent Adobe CC (Creative Cloud) pricing is currently $52.99/month which includes access to 20 applications. Discounts are available for students and teachers who can pay $19.99/month. Adobe no longer offers a one-time payment for any of its software and hasn't since 2013; it is only available through a subscription.\n\nFreelancers are able to deduct the cost of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription as a business expense while designers hired by an agency or company will have the software provided for them by their employer. This is why the cost of an Adobe CC subscription is less of a consideration for working designers than it is for others.\n\nIt is common for those developing a new interest design to give too much focus to software and not enough to learning the fundamentals of design. You can find more information on design principles at the link below:\n\n[**https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/principles-of-design**](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/principles-of-design)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What kind of work do designers do?**\n\nMost working designers don't spend the majority of their time creating logos and branding, album covers, posters, and t-shirts that are often showcased here. Companies who hire designers are often in need of marketing collateral \u2013 brochures, sell sheets, print mailers, and other pieces that sell their product or service.\u00a0Print and online ads, social media posts, email newsletters, instructional videos, presentations, are other types of pieces that companies regularly require. Video editing and motion graphics (animated videos with less footage and more text and graphics) are now common requirements of design positions.\n\nThere *are* design studios, agencies, and freelancers that focus on one specific skill such as Branding, Packaging, or Video, but the majority offer a more comprehensive set of services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is a graphic designer's typical day like?**\n\nThere is no typical day for graphic designers since the type and size of workplace, the industry, size of department that the designer works in, the designer's specific role, and other factors play into this.\n\nHowever, most designers do less actual design work than those not yet working in the field might imagine. In-house teams will meet to discuss projects and other items, smaller groups or individuals may meet with internal stakeholders (those who require the designer's work), agencies will meet with clients, and administrative work like project tracking, file transfer or organization, and other non-design-related tasks will need to be accomplished.\n\nSome days may be spent doing purely creative work (often when a deadline is looming) though this can be rare. More often a designer will switch between working on concepts for a new project, making revisions and sending out completed projects, meeting with their team, tracking and organizing projects, and researching solutions to problems or learning new skills and techniques.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need to use a Mac to design?**\n\nNo. Macs were dominant when digital design started in the late 80s/early 90s as design software was sometimes only made for MacIntosh computers. Because of this, schools at that time primarily used Macs to teach design, which led to an early wave of Mac dominance in the field that carried on for decades.\n\nThese days design software is mostly available for either platform\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Mac or PC (and sometimes UNIX as well). When looking for a computer to use for Graphic Design, focus on your processor power, RAM, amount of storage (disk space), and screen size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What kind of tablet should I get for design?**\n\nMost designers don't use tablets as their primary design tool. Laptops are by far the #1 tool of designers, often connected to additional monitors for increased screen real estate. Desktop computers are used for design as well. The use of tablets is growing, though at this point they are much more commonly used for sketching, illustration, and for displaying work to clients than for actual doing actual design. Animators, hand letterers, and photo retouchers are likely to use tablets for their work as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need a degree to be a designer?**\n\nHaving a degree in design isn't necessary in order to get a job as a designer, but it is often required for specific jobs \u2013 especially in-house (corporate ) jobs. Bachelor's Degrees are the most common type of degree for working designers to have, but it's not uncommon for a designer to have an Associate's Degree or some type of certificate. Master's Degrees in design are rare. More than 70% of job listings for Graphic Design positions require a degree of some sort. However, nothing is required to work as a freelance designer.\n\nThose without degrees who wish to work in-house or for a creative agency will often work as freelancers for a number of years before applying for design positions. This allows them to build up skills, experience, and their network in order to be in a better position to be considered for a full time design position. Jobs in print shops, t-shirt shops, and small companies or startups are a common entry points for those entering the design field without a degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can I teach myself Graphic Design?**\n\nIt's possible but very difficult as most people exploring design for the first time have no idea as to where to start and what to search for. While there are many successful self-taught designers, they sometimes focus on a certain style or area of design. Self-taught designers may start out with limited knowledge of fundamentals like typography, color theory, printing techniques and other areas of design that colleges and universities include as part of their curriculum, though many will explore these areas more as they continue to work in the field.\n\n[**Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/), [**Skillshare**](https://www.skillshare.com/), [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/), and [**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) (formerly Lynda.com) often recommended here for their online courses on Graphic Design as well as other disciplines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need to develop my own style?**\n\nNo. Most working designers don't have a consistent, identifiable style that they use for each project. There are a handful of \"name\" designers who do work this way, though they may be better thought of as Graphic Artists who are hired, similar to illustrators, specifically to employ their style on projects.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of designers have no set style and adapt as needed to the requirements of each new project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's the difference between working in-house for a company and working at a creative agency?**\n\nIn general, agencies are more fast-paced and require designers to work more hours (which may include weekends) in order to meet their clients' needs, but there is often more prestige associated with working for an agency\u00a0\u2013 especially those with well known clients on their roster. Designers at agencies usually value the ability to work with a variety of clients rather than working for a single client. One risk of working for an agency is the contraction that happens when a large client is lost, which often leads to laying off designers as well as other agency staff. Agencies expand and contract based on their client roster.\n\nWorking as an in-house designer means working for a company or other organization, often (but not always) working on a single brand according to brand guidelines. In-house jobs typically provide stability, more regular hours (as companies often depend on agencies to hit deadlines), and other benefits associated with a \"9 to 5\" type corporate job. Often projects that are considered more exciting (such as branding/rebranding) and that require strategic plans to be developed along with customer research are given to agencies while in-house designers handle more mundane or self-contained projects. In-house designers will often be asked to develop internal pieces directed at the company's employees, which usually have less stringent rules than designs being seen by the public and which may offer some additional variety.\n\nIt's more common for designers to start by working at an agency and move in-house later in their career rather than the other way around. Often agencies will require previous experience at an agency before they consider hiring a job candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How much do graphic designers make?**\n\nIn the U.S., the average salary for a designer in 2020 has been reported at around $50,000 or $25/hour. This varies greatly by the type of workplace (in-house/corporate, agency, etc.), region, education, and experience level. It's uncommon to make more than $130,000 USD as a Graphic Designer. To go beyond that salary level, designers often step up to become Art Directors or Creative Directors, where they do less or no design themselves and instead are responsible for leading a team of designers and staff in other roles to complete projects as well as interfacing with clients (internal and external) and the senior staff they report to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is it easy to find work as a freelance designer?**\n\nOnly a small percent of designers make their full time living by freelancing. The vast majority of people who do freelance design are doing it as a supplement to another job \u2013 a full time design job or otherwise. Less than 10% of individual working designers make their living primarily from freelance work. Those who are successful as an individual freelance designer often join or hire others to form a creative agency, making them no longer freelancers.\n\nGoing \"full time freelance\" is a challenge for many and those who are successful at it often build up a steady roster of clients as well as a solid network before quitting their full time jobs. Saving a year's worth of salary or more before resigning is usually recommended.\n\nThose who consider working as a freelance designer with little or no previous design experience often underestimate how much effort, time, and cost is required to get new clients, how much time they need devote to learning how to operate a business, and how many hours they will need to spend each week doing non-billable tasks. It would not be unusual for a freelance designer working 50 hours per week to only have 20-25 hours they can bill for. State, Federal, and sometimes City Wage Taxes will also need to be considered.\n\nAnother challenge as a full time freelancer is obtaining medical insurance which is a not included as a government service in the U.S. Younger designers will often stay on their parents' insurance, but after a certain age this isn't possible. Independently paying for healthcare is expensive and often provides a major challenge for those hoping to freelance full time. Married freelancers in the U.S. will often go on their spouses' medical insurance if it's available.\n\nStarting out as a freelancer with no real world experience is generally not advised as the designer has no opportunity to work in an existing company or agency, seeing how they operate as well as learning to interface with clients and developing their design skills with the help of more senior designers and art directors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How much should I charge as a freelancer?**\n\nIn very broad terms, experienced freelance designers in the U.S. charge:\n\n\u2022 $10-$30/hour for a design student\n\n\u2022 $30-$50/hour for a designer with several years' experience\n\n\u2022 $50-$100/hour for a designer with more experience as well as a broader range of skills, including developing strategy (rather than doing only design)\n\n\u2022 $100+/hour for freelancers with a high level of skills and experience, often with industry-specific knowledge like pharmaceutical, real estate, or financial industries\n\nAgencies in the U.S. often charge $300/$500/hour for their services.\n\nHowever, many freelancers don't provide clients with their hourly rates and will instead talk through the project with the client, estimate how long the project will take them, and present a final amount to the client. This is called a flat fee.\n\nIt is strongly advised not to begin work on a project until the fee has been discussed and approved by the client. Most clients don't want to be surprised by fees that are higher than they were anticipating, and doing so will lead to problems. This is a common mistake of people doing freelance work for the first time.\n\nThe vast majority of freelancers starting out undercharge for their work, often charging 10%\u201320% of what would be recommended for their skill and experience level.\n\nIt is common practice for full-time freelancers to require a client to sign a contract as well as to pay a percentage (often 50%) of the project fee before beginning work. Doing this without exception has the added benefit of warding off would-be scammers or clients who may not have ultimately paid the project fee.\n\nLinked from the article below is the AIGA's Standard Form of Agreement for Design Services which contains modules that designers can customize and use for their own freelance work:\n\n[**https://www.aiga.org/resources/business-freelance-resources**](https://www.aiga.org/resources/business-freelance-resources)\n\nMany freelancers will include a watermark saying \"DRAFT\" or \"PRELIMINARY\" on their designs as they present them to clients, only removing the watermark and sending final designs after the final payment has been made.\n\nThis minimum price guide created by Hadeel Sayed Ahmad may also be helpful:\n\n[**https://www.behance.net/gallery/67384009/Official-DU-Design-Minimum-Price-List**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/67384009/Official-DU-Design-Minimum-Price-List)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where can I find freelance clients?**\n\nFinding clients is a challenge for any freelancer, but moreso for those who are just starting out. Tapping into family, friends, classmates and co-workers by letting them know that you're looking for design work is a good way to start. Often local organizations like religious institutions, schools, and non-profits that a designer is already connected to are a way get work experience and portfolio pieces as those organizations typically have small (if any) budgets allocated for design and marketing and are willing to go with someone with little design experience who charges accordingly.\n\nOne risk of working very cheap or free is that the client may place little value on the work and may not even use it in the end, especially if multiple cheap/free solutions are available to them. Cheap/free clients will rarely become clients who pay well \u2013 even if their budgets greatly increase in the future, these clients will often think of the designer as \"the cheap designer\" and will move on to designers or agencies they see as more prestigious once opportunity allows. The promise of more and highly paid work from a client after doing cheap/free work for them is common but rarely comes to fruition.\n\nIf a designer is working at a discount or at no cost to an organization in order to get early real world work samples, it can be helpful to send an invoice for the full amount that would have been charged, calling out the discount as well as the $0 final invoice amount. This educates the client on the value of the work they're receiving and can benefit both parties.\n\nOnce a designer has work they can promote on their website and social media, freelance work often builds organically. Satisfied clients will come back to the designer for future work and are likely to recommend their services to others.\n\nAnother way to find work as a freelancer is to contact agencies and offer to work with them when they may be beyond capacity with their own staff or skills. This often works better with small agencies local to the designer. It also helps if the designer has specific skills that are less common such as video shooting/editing, programming, hand lettering, or motion graphics capabilities, which a smaller agency's staff are less likely to be able to do themselves.\n\nOne benefit that happens naturally over time is a designer's friends and classmates will be hired into jobs or create companies that need design work, and they will look for people they know to fill those roles.\n\nWhile many freelance designers sign up for sites like Fiverr, 99designs, Design Pickle, Penji, and other online marketplaces that connect clients to creatives, this is a very difficult and rarely sustainable method of working as pay is often extremely low. For contest sites like 99designs, payment is not guaranteed as dozens or more designers complete work in the hopes of being paid. Because of this system, designers often submit the same designs with slight customizations to multiple contests, causing low quality overall. Logos stolen from existing companies have also been seen on these marketplaces, which creates risk for the client.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should I create a name for my freelance company/website or should I use my own name?**\n\nEither is fine but it has become more common over time for freelance designers to use their name as their domain or some combination of their name and the service they offer, like **katsmythcreative.com**. Freelance designers in the early days of the Internet were more likely to create a company name, often to give the impression that they are more than a lone designer. This can become problematic once the client contacts the design studio and realizes it is a single person. The idea of the independent creative has become more accepted over time, and it's not unusual even for large companies to work with solo designers or other creatives who have distinguished themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Are design contests worth entering?**\n\nIf your hope is that a company will see your contest entry and decide to hire you, probably not. Contests may be helpful, though more for developing a designer's skills and giving them a winning or placing entry that they can use to promote as opposed to gaining organic notoriety from the contest itself. It is true, though, that being able to promote oneself as an \"award-winning designer\" can have some value in legitimizing the designer in the eyes of prospective clients.\n\nIt may be better to develop design skills using challenges or sites that generate fictional briefs. Here are a few:\n\n[**dailylogochallenge.com**](https://dailylogochallenge.com)\n\n[**goodbrief.io**](https://goodbrief.io)\n\n[**www.briefbox.me**](https://www.briefbox.me)\n\n[**fakeclients.com**](https://fakeclients.com)\n\nYou may also want to seek out design *competitions*, which (when the term is used correctly) indicates that past real world work will be reviewed as opposed to designers creating new work, often around a specific theme, that design *contests* request. When looking for design competitions as a new designer, be aware that many entrants are seasoned design veterans or creative agencies whose work quality and resources are likely to be far more developed than a new designer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is this style called?**\n\nNot all styles have names and many pieces use a combination of existing styles (often with varying names for the same style) or create a unique style of their own, so a piece you're interested in may not be easy or possible to connect to a named style.\n\nHowever, it's good to familiarize yourself with styles and trends, even if only to know what has been done in the past and what is currently being created. Below are a handful of sites with lists of movements, styles, and trends. Note that there is much crossover between design styles and fine art movements:\n\n[**https://fhcigraphicdesign.weebly.com/graphic-design-movements.html**](https://fhcigraphicdesign.weebly.com/graphic-design-movements.html)\n\n[**https://www.shillingtoneducation.com/blog/graphic-design-styles**](https://www.shillingtoneducation.com/blog/graphic-design-styles)\n\n[**https://www.superside.com/blog/guide-to-design-styles**](https://www.superside.com/blog/guide-to-design-styles)\n\n[**https://www.infographicdesignteam.com/blog/guide-to-graphic-design-styles**](https://www.infographicdesignteam.com/blog/guide-to-graphic-design-styles)\n\n[**https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/graphic-design-styles**](https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/graphic-design-styles)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's the best place to sell my designs online?**\n\nThere are many online marketplaces as well as stock sites and new ones are always appearing, but most have become saturated to the point where few if any sales will come organically and will instead require steady marketing on the designer's part to see results. Instagram is often used as a platform to promote designers' wares like t-shirts, posters, and other designs to be printed on demand. Posting your designs and hoping they will sell themselves will almost certainly lead to disappointment.\n\nKnowing this, here are some online marketplaces to consider selling your work:\n\n[**https://society6.com**](https://society6.com/)\n\n[**https://www.redbubble.com**](https://www.redbubble.com/)\n\n[**https://teespring.com**](https://teespring.com/)\n\n[**https://www.zazzle.com**](https://www.zazzle.com/)\n\n[**https://graphicriver.net**](https://graphicriver.net/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where can I find free photos and fonts to use?**\n\nSome common sites that offer free images are [**pexels.com**](https://pexels.com), [**morguefile.com**](https://morguefile.com), and [**unsplash.com**](https://unsplash.com).\n\nNote that some of these sites will show a limited number of free image options combined with a selection from a paid service (their own or another), so be careful when searching for these assets.\n\nAlso be sure to read the site's terms and conditions carefully. Some images may be used without restrictions while others may require that the image creator receive attribution, notification, or other requirement may need to be met. Many sites that offer free or even paid vector elements will prohibit those elements from being used in logo designs, or as product designs where the image is the main selling point \u2013 for example, t-shirt designs with one large, featured image.\n\nThree well known sites that offer free fonts are [**dafont.com**](https://dafont.com), [**fontspace.com**](https://fontspace.com), and [**fontsquirrel.com**](https://fontsquirrel.com). As with the above, be sure to read the terms for each font downloaded. Many fonts are free for personal use while a license must be purchased when using those fonts commercially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need a portfolio site to find a job?**\n\nAlmost certainly. Most companies will want to view a website with your work. 7-10 pieces is often more than enough to include. Writing at least a short amount of text about each project is recommended, focusing on the challenge, designer's process, and the final outcome (if it's a real-world project). Modern portfolios are more often organized by project (one client or campaign showing multiple pieces \u2013 logo, website, ad, etc.) rather than grouping all logos together, all videos together, etc.\n\nThough some companies offer free hosting, they often include those plans on their own domain, which creates a URL similar to this: [**www.designername.host-company.com**](http://www.designername.host-company.com)\n\nThis is not ideal as it highlights the fact that the designer has not paid for their own domain. Purchasing **designername.com** and pointing it to the hosting site is seen as more professional.\n\n[**More information on portfolio advice for new designers.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/u14sxx/portfolio_advice_for_new_designers/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should my resume be \"designed\"?**\n\nOpinions vary. Some experienced designers recommend a standard resume format in order to get past companies' and recruiters' ATS (Applicant Tracking System) resume-reading software. Others recommend using the piece to show your design skills and standing out from more standardly-formatted resumes.\n\nA reasonably accepted compromise is to keep the resume black and white, avoid large filled-in areas (especially around page borders) which can cause problems with resume-reading software, and to focus on solid typography and layout with minimal graphical elements (bullets, lines, simple logo/wordmark).\n\nGraphs showing software ability or other skills came in fashion in the 2010s, but are widely considered to not be helpful to include on a resume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should I complete a design test for a job I've applied for?**\n\nDesign tests are becoming more common for design jobs. Some consider these type of tests to be Spec Work \u2013 work done speculatively, in the hopes of some type of compensation (typically payment or a job). The AIGA (The American Institute of Graphic Arts) is opposed to spec work in general. Read more here:\n\n[**https://www.aiga.org/resources/aiga-position-on-spec-work**](https://www.aiga.org/resources/aiga-position-on-spec-work)\n\nSome companies hiring designers genuinely want to see how they work through a project brief as well as how they communicate with a client (in this case, the company requesting the test). Often these tests only require a few hours' worth of work. However, other companies will use job tests as a way to get free work from designers. In some cases there is not even an open design position available. Do careful research on companies requesting job tests and consider adding watermarks to any work you may complete as a way to dissuade the company from using them for their own or their clients' purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is it hard to get a job as a graphic designer?**\n\nIt often is. However, there is heavier competition for entry level positions than there is for those with more experience. The design field has become saturated since the growth of the internet in the early 2000s and that, combined with competition from online marketplaces, design contest sites, and other factors, has made finding work as a designer more competitive by turning design from a service to a commodity. However, some areas of design such as UX/UI Design, Web Design, and Multimedia Design continue to grow in demand and offer higher salaries than other forms of design.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Who are some well-known graphic designers I can learn from?**\n\nAaron Draplin\n\nAlan Fletcher\n\nAlexey Brodovitch\n\nApril Greiman\n\nBob Gill (type)\n\nCarolyn Davidson (Nike logo)\n\nChip Kidd (book covers)\n\nDavid Carson (magazine)\n\nDebbie Millman (author/educator)\n\nErik Spiekermann (type)\n\nFred Woodward\n\nGail Anderson\n\nHerb Lubalin (type)\n\nHermann Zapf (type)\n\nHouse Industries\n\nJessica Hische (lettering)\n\nJessica Walsh\n\nJonathan Barnbrook\n\nJonathan Hoefler (type)\n\nAries Moross\n\nLindon Leader (FedEx logo)\n\nMassimo Vignelli (NY subway map)\n\nMichael Bierut\n\nMilton Glaser (I heart NY logo)\n\nNeville Brody\n\nPaul Rand (IBM, ABC, UPS logos)\n\nPaula Scher\n\nPeter Saville\n\nRob Janoff (Apple logo)\n\nSaul Bass (movie posters/titles)\n\nSeymour Chwast\n\nStefan Sagmeister\n\nSteven Heller (author)\n\nStorm Thorgerson (album covers)\n\nSusan Kare (original Mac OS icons)\n\nTibor Kalman (magazine)\n\nTimothy Goodman",

Adobe products, on a PC, making $50k, working in-house, some side freelancing, portfolio site with my name, and a designed resume. Though it was so relieving to hear that I don\u2019t need an esthetic. I\u2019m so all over the board on design styles and while my coworkers and managers love the flexibility, I always felt like I wasn\u2019t a good designer because of that. \n\n10 years since college and still learning.",
            "Great info, thank you. \n\nOne of the most important questions is missing though: is drop shadow back in yet?",
            "That last part about \u201chow hard is it to get a graphic design job\u201d is 100% true. You\u2019d think that most places would want to hire a young, fresh designer with new perspectives to diversify their branding a little bit, but this way of thinking sadly isn\u2019t too common. More often than not, companies would rather hire someone older with more experience than they would someone who is young. \n\nA great source of opportunity is through a recruiter or recruiting service. They\u2019ll give you a better head start, and as long as you work your butt off they\u2019ll give you some great connections. \n\nAnother thing to realize as a designer is that you\u2019re not gonna be dipping your fingers into every aspect of the brand, and you probably won\u2019t be manipulating it that much either. Most places will want to stick to their usual visual style rather than switch it up. The past 3 places I\u2019ve worked would rather I look at their older pieces for inspiration instead of me creating my own twist on it.\n\nFinally, the most important thing to realize is that every company (in some shape or form) needs a graphic designer. Whether they hire a company to do it for them or keep a small design team in house, you could find yourself designing for pretty much anyone. I worked in the design department for a small awards company, did ads for a political ad agency, and now I\u2019m working at a startup building automotive software. So don\u2019t restrict yourself to the places that sound cool or that sound the most creatively freeing, not when you\u2019re starting out at least.",
            "Great job on the FAQ\u2019s, but I would recommend tweaking your tablet answer. iPad and iPad Pro\u2019s are coming more common in the designers workflows. It isn\u2019t a replacement to the desktop, but it helps with initial sketches, inspiration, and showing off work to a client.",
            "Excellent!!!! Everyone should read this, newbies and experienced. I've been in graphics since high school. This led to 30+years in design, advertising, marketing and a MBA. Thank you. Aloha",
            "Great post!\n\nI understand Adobe is the industry standard but their pricing model really kills me. I'm never going to use 3/4 of the programs I'd be paying $53/month for. I guess the tax write-off makes it better, but I hate that \"cable tv\" subscription model (the ol' \"I only want these couple of channels, but I've got to pay for all of them).\n\nOf course they've taken into account the fact that many if no most designers would only want Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, and they price them so that buying three programs is more expensive than getting all 20.\n\nI'm still using CS6, but maybe someday I'll have to succumb and go with the subscription.\n\nAlso, I would like to note that the Affinity apps that I've used are great. If you're like me and don't use Photoshop too heavily, you could probably get by with paying for Illustrator CC and using Affinity Photo rather than paying for Photoshop CC.",
            "This is really useful to a complete beginner like myself, thank you so much for this post :)",
            ">**Do I need to know how to draw to be a designer?**No. Graphic Design isn't art/drawing/illustration. Both disciplines are related but the majority of designers are not especially skilled at drawing. However, many designers will do rough sketches to work out designs such as logos, brochures, and advertisements. Small, simple sketches are called thumbnails while more refined sketches are called comps (short for comprehensive). These are usually not shown to the client, though including some of these process pieces in a portfolio can be helping in demonstrating a designer's work process.\n\nI have to add that I am not a fan saying no to this question. I realize the answer here is nuanced, but to say no does more harm than good, in my opinion. Saying that you don\u2019t have to \u2018know how to draw\u2019 gives a false sense of security to prospective designers that they can succeed in an over-crowded, insanely competitive field if they have no drawing skills whatsoever. This is just patently false and it will be much harder to succeed without this skill. You don't have to be a master of the craft, but you absolutely have to know how to draw as a designer. Learning how to draw is not the same thing as becoming a master illustrator or even a great illustrator, it is about understanding how light and shape make our visual world \u2014 vital knowledge for a visual communicator.\n\nIf you don't learn how to draw you will forever fight that inability for your whole career. If the question was \u201cDo I have to be a great illustrator to be a graphic designer,\u201d then the answer should be no, but the question is about knowing how, not being incredible at it. This distinction is very important.",
            "Thankfully here in the uk we dont have to pay for medical as such besides taxes. Even still the pay level is lower here for graphic designers. Especially those starting a career like myself in junior positions, your lucky to be on more than 16 - 20k a year here for that position. Out of London its worse. London pay is around 25k per/anum for a junior to balance out living cost.\n\nIve been out of employment since august last year now, trying to find another stable job is virtually impossible. Applications never get a response and when they do, your lucky to get to interview stage. \n\nI think I\u2019ve counted over 300 applications since i lost my last job and had around 10 responses. Partly because middleweight level designers are also loosing their jobs and applying for anything including jobs at my junior level. So I\u2019m having to compete with someone at a higher position than myself. Its shit.",
            "Thank you for this post, it's quelling my fears a bit! I'm planning (or should I say, hoping and praying) to go to college for design this fall.

            "I have a question. Whenever someone asks how they can get better, the answer they usually get is something along the lines of \"design a lot, copy artwork that inspire you,\" and so on.\n\nBeen there, done that. Now I'd say I'm fairly good at replicating. When someone wants a poster \"like this one\", I can pretty much do it really well.\n\nBut I'm terrible at coming up with my own ideas and designs. Whenever I try to create an art from scratch it looks like a hot pile of garbage. I have absolutely _no clue_ on how to fix that. Anyone have any tips?",
            "Here is my own almost 5 year experience: \nDo I need to know how to draw to be a designer? \nTechnically, in some forms, yes. You don\u2019t need to be an amazing pencil drawing wizard, but you DO need to know how to use the pen tool. Drawing talent also give you a major edge in the industry and can bump your designs up immensely. \n\nI like to draw does that mean I\u2019ll be good at graphic design? \nNo. Liking to draw and being good are two different things. Graphic design to me  is understanding how people interpret visuals and language and making the path to their understanding of the target subject quick and easy. There are rules to follow with graphic design in some senses. These same rules don\u2019t exist within simply drawing. \n\nAm I suited to be a graphic designer? \nDo you want to be? Keep trying, learning, and creating. Don\u2019t limit it just to graphic design. \n\nWhat software do I need to be a designer? \nPrimarily Adobe, but multiple others depending on the situation. The free-er the ware, the better in cost unless you have a company to completely pay for it. \n\nWhat kind of work do designers do? \nAt this point, what do you want to specialize in? If you don\u2019t want to specialize in anything, the answer above is correct. Otherwise you CAN specialize in those type of items if you find the right outlet. It\u2019s all down to the job you end up with. \n\nTypical day: \nAgree no typical day exists. Some days are extra long and other days are super short. \n\nDo I need I Mac to design? \nNo but from my experience it\u2019s heavily preferred. There are certain functions that windows has never integrated properly, such as dragging and dropping images from one\u2019s program to another, super easy ability to screen shot, better preview function with a simple space bar push on Mac\u2026. \n\nIf you\u2019re starting out brand new I don\u2019t think it truly matters, but Mac is still superior on this to me. \n\nWhat kind of tablet should I get for design? \nYou don\u2019t need one. If you like to do art as well, get an iPad and procreate. \n\nDo I need a degree to be a designer? \n\nNo. You just need to know what you\u2019re doing. If you went to college for a little while, and can show an amazing portfolio, jobs don\u2019t seem to care. Just be able to back up your work. If you don\u2019t go to school at all, create an amazing portfolio and try to get freelance wherever you can to add to it. Even if you want to just do it for your portfolio, that helps. \n\nCan I teach myself graphic design? \nI don\u2019t think you can teach yourself something like graphic design. You need some form of instruction to understand the basics and \u201crules\u201d. \n\nDo I need to develop my own style? \nYour own style will always be there, you made it. \nbut ultimately it will change depending on the needs of the clients if it\u2019s a style you prefer. \n\nIn house vs creative: \nIn house can be all over the place depending on the size of the company. If you don\u2019t have graphics to work on, you may have other tasks like setting up trade shows. You may  become a marketing professional. You may even end up with general administrative tasks and HR. I\u2019ve seen this through multiple companies with people I know. \n\nHow much do graphic designers make? \nI can only speak for myself. I currently make $55,000 and have almost 5years of experience. I\u2019m salary. \n\nWhere can I find freelance clients? \nTalk to your local print shop companies. They frequently need assistance. \n\nShould my resume be designed? \nI think so? I went to school for visual communication. I was hired for a job for office management. I was hired because they wanted me to pick up their graphic design and marketing: I was the only candidate with a designed resume. \n\nIf you\u2019re a designer, I really think you should be showing off your skill in your resume. \n\n\n\n\nIn the end: if you\u2019re looking to become a designer, never stop learning. You should retrain yourself every single year- because trends and programs change. You need to see what other people are doing and make changes to your own style based on that. \nIf you want to make a big impact, I recommend to help out small businesses starting out. \nI think you need to Learn more than just design, learn how to do analytics and trade show coordination. Have a general understanding of business. Make yourself super valuable. Don\u2019t limit yourself just to print and digital 2d designs, learn CAD softwares, learn video, photography, build your traditional art skills, and really understand the company you\u2019re working for. \nGraphic design is a means for visual communication, but just like communicating with language, it can easily get lost in translation. But don\u2019t forget, If everyone\u2019s graphic design followed the exact same rules and trends, and looked the same, how would you be able to stand out from the crowd?",
            "As someone who has been in Design and Printing for 20+ years my advice would be to be aware of what is design for Web and what is design for Print and learn what it takes to do both efficiently. Part of my job is to every day tell some hotshot designer that his cool design is all RGB,  has no bleed, design is wrong size, the fonts are not embedded, and the images are only 72 dpi and will look like crap when printed. \n\nApparently they don't teach students how to use actual rulers these days and those other things in designer school or the students where absent those days. So if you know your designs will be going to print make sure design with that in mind so you don't end up telling me what school you graduated from after I send you a long email bout what's wrong with your bangin' design.",

It used to be a certificate but changed over as of late. Luckily for me, this program near its last term includes an internship which you do have to apply for at different places. But it gives you 9 weeks (I think) of hands-on experience and the opportunity for networking. Which I've learned is extremely important! Needless to say, I am excited to learn and the possible prospects of a fulfilling career path. I'm 24 and I have struggled to find something that wouldn't be too monotonous. What attracted me to this whole industry is just how vast it is in terms of integration. There is so much to do! There are other personal creative projects in mind, but I hope that I can gain real-world experience by working at some form of company or agency for a few years first. Then go freelancing afterward.

I know I\u2019m at the high end because the company I work at is ultra competitive but I have seen higher salaries for competent designers in bigger cities. \n\nDesign test: never. If a hiring manager can\u2019t tell your competency from your portfolio and interviews that\u2019s a huge red flag. Remember when interviewing, as much as the company is interviewing you for the job you are also interviewing them to see if they are the right place to work.\n\nInhouse vs agency: I\u2019ve always worked inhouse and never for an agency. You can still be successful. \n\nSelf taught designers: I am 100% self taught. I taught myself through YouTube videos and looking up the syllabus from design schools.

However, most of my team is in that younger age range.\n\nAgreed on companies not typically wanting designers to come in and change things too much. But still, when you're working on things like videos, motion graphics, podcasts, apps, presentations, or anything the company hasn't done much of, there are often opportunities to break some new ground.\n\nI considered mentioning recruiters but I've never used one to find a job and I don't hear about that experience too much, especially here on the sub, so I didn't want go guess at what that's like.

            "Thanks for the kind words! I don't think most people use the majority of Adobe apps. You can look at that kind of pricing two ways - \"I would have paid $60 a month for just Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Acrobat but I get access to all the others for the same price\" - or - \"They're charging me $60 a month for 20 apps but I only need four of them, so I'm wasting that extra money\". I look at it the first way, though I regularly use Premiere, Audition, After Effects, Media Encoder, and sometimes Animate and Character Animator for my job plus freelance, so I'm using a decent amount of them. Getting into XD now too. \n\nPaying $1,700 for a handful of apps that I needed in 1999 ($2,680 in today's money) \u2013 plus a few grand for my first Mac at home has definitely influenced my opinion of Adobe's pricing. I wasn't even doing enough freelance work back then to cover my costs, now it's a minor and expected fee \u2013 and a tax deduction.\n\nCool on Affinity.

I can say I worked one in-house design job for over two decades and I only worked past 4:45 PM rarely, like maybe less than once per year, and only one weekend day ever on a critical project. Almost any project could wait until the next day or next week, and if they couldn't you got better at juggling deadlines and working faster and more efficiently so you didn't have to work late. Especially true, for me at least, once I was married and had a child. \n\nYes, it's a common concern not to have to work crazy hours, but when people are young and don't have their own families, they're more likely to make that sacrifice in order to work that kind of job at that kind of agency. Yes, often you'll find the environment is at least a bit more relaxed than at a corporate job, especially at smaller agencies.\n\nAs far as needing to only go into the office a few days a week, that kind of thing will be more common everywhere from now on. I work another corporate design job now that I started just about a year ago and I haven't been to the office (and won't go until September at the earliest) and haven't met my boss or team. And in the future we got the choice to work fully or partial remote (I chose partial - 2 days a week in the office) so remote work won't be off the table for any type of job, design or otherwise.\n\nI hope that helps \u2013 glad you enjoyed the post!",

These days the kinds of clients I had, which were small to medium sized companies, would never hire me or a developer to build a custom site from scratch. For my own freelance clients these days who need websites, I direct them to Squarespace, Wix or Wordpress and I develop and style the site.

            "It's not art in the sense that most people, especially younger people who like drawing, think of art. They're thinking of fine art. But it as AN art, but as I said, more of a craft. \n\nThere is art in graphic design, cooking, writing, even business, science, and other areas not commonly thought of as creative. But I'd never call myself an artist when I'm working as a designer. I recently got back into painting (acrylics) and I did a bunch of pieces just for me. That was pure art. Me being asked to design as website for a classic rock tribute band (real project) isn't anything like that.",
            "Saying it's not art isn't a bad thing and shouldn't be discouraging. Art is subjective - viewers can interpret it differently from the original creator's intentions and that's okay. \n\nHowever that is the opposite of design, design is intentional and communicative, so if your viewers are seeing, experiencing or feeling something totally opposite to what you had in mind, that's a problem and means your design was unsuccessful. \n\nI came from a fine arts background and still do illustration on the side, but I've been a full-time designer for about 6 years now and it's super different from making art. Again, that's not bad, it doesn't mean I can't have fun making personal design work, they're just different processes and mindsets imo.",
            "Personally I would say design is *an* art, same as music, same as cooking etc... It is an art going from the brief, the problem - to an appropriate solution optimised to yield efficient results... Think of a website like Amazon, or premium quality branding, packaging... Advertisement, it all subtly influences you and your behaviour, it influences if you buy something, how you buy something, how you use things, it changes your behaviour...Design is all about clear and direct communication.",
            "I was on my first career as a product designer when the teacher told the class that Art is not design but design can be art.\n\nThis is coming from the fact that Art places aesthetics before functionality, while design works in reverse, first comes the functionality and then comes aesthetics. \n\nThis concept helped me a lot when I changed my career to graphic design, and I have always had this approach.\n\nNormally a design is a product of investigation, feedback and creativity, and serves a certain purpose\nWhile Art is considered being the full expression of feelings and context of the artists, and doesn\u2019t necessarily serve a functional purpose.\n\nI also want to talk about creativity; I believe EVERY career requires creativity, from biology and sciences, because they require some sort of creativity to come up with their hypothesis and to try those hypothesis. And well this could be applied to most careers.\n\nTLDR: Design=Function>aesthetics while Art=Aesthetics>function. Creativity is used in all careers not only humanities & art",
            "I think you have to leave the emotional component behind to a degree, it has to be about the work and it's intent, rather than how you want to perceive yourself or feel about the work. Your work and your job should not define you as a person. \n\nLike Mango described, the main difference is about the intent. As a designer your role is a specialist in visual communication, you are solving problems for other people. It is not about your personal views/goals, your personal creativity or expression. \n\nLiterally anything can be art if even *one person* considers it to be art. That's all it takes. An artist can also create a work with an intended message or interpretation (or none at all), and if a hundred people viewed it and all had varying interpretations the work can still be successful, maybe even more successful if these interpretations spur passionate opinions and debate. \n\nWith graphic design, such a scenario would all but certainly result in failed work. You would want your message to ideally be interpreted as you intended by as many people within the target demo as possible. \n\nImagine if you were doing signage in a hospital as if it was a work of art, or instructions to assemble furniture, or an annual report, or a product package. These are all examples that have a very clear purpose, and by which the success of the design can be directly evaluated as per those objectives.",

            "Part of this could depend on your reasoning behind the master's. \n\nWithin the design industry, even if you already had a bachelor's in design, having a master's really only has value if you intend to teach at the post-secondary level full-time. (You can teach part-time without one.) It otherwise will not give you a head start or a salary boost, and it's unlikely you'll be much better off than anyone coming out of a decent 3-4 year design program. (It's actually generally advised you get some work experience between the bachelor's and master's.)\n\nIn your specific case where you don't have a related bachelor's degree, it would be good to better examine the program and look into what it's actually developing. \n\nA master's in design is not meant to be a surrogate for a bachelor's but to build on it's foundation. Typically master's programs will require a design bachelor's or otherwise related as part of their admissions for that reason. In cases where they are willing to look past that, you'd still need to establish a certain level of ability via the portfolio part of the process. \n\nFrom ones I've seen with a lesser barrier to entry, they tend to be more about examining the theory, philosophical or social aspects of design, which many not have much relevance in terms of entering the industry.",

            "Most people who claim to have Imposter Syndrome really don't. The term has become distorted. The real meaning of the term is to feel like an imposter \u2013\u00a0like you're fooling everyone because you're not as good as they think you are. But now people use it to mean \"I'm insecure about my skills\" or \"I have a lot to learn.\" Most young people who get their first job or are in the process of looking for a job are overwhelmed at all the new things they have to learn, both direct job knowledge (design skills, in our case) as well as what it's like to look for a job, interview, work a \"real\" job for the first time, etc. \n\nAll of those things are natural when you're starting out but none of them are part of Imposter Syndrome unless the majority of people around you are treating you as if you have more knowledge, skills, and experience than you actually do, or you believe you do. From what I see people post here and on other sites, this isn't the case. Their interviewers or new co-workers are treating them like competent professionals, which they're not used to, but much of that is politeness \u2013\u00a0which the younger, newer person also doesn't recognize. It's very rare that a group of more experienced, older people see their new 22 year old college grad working their first professional job and think, \"They are absolutely blowing me away in every regard!\" They're being nice and expecting you'll grow into it. \n\nThe same goes for people doing freelance work, though you can get away with more if you're not meeting face-to-face, if you don't do video chats or have your photo on your website, etc. But often, they still know.\n\nFor reference, I first heard the term in the early 90s when a young actor in his early 20s was given the chance to direct a big budget Hollywood movie. He went from doing little plays in England to having a $30 million budget and a cast and crew of 300 working for him. He wrote in his autobiography about how he felt he was fooling everyone, but early on a more experienced actor told him he was experiencing Imposter Symdrome reassured him that he was doing great, everyone knew it was his first movie and he had a lot to learn, and they knew he'd do just that. Now *that* is Imposter Syndrome.\n\nThere are articles and videos about this, like this one:  \n[https://medium.com/counter-intuition/you-don-t-have-impostor-syndrome-126e4c4bdcc](https://medium.com/counter-intuition/you-don-t-have-impostor-syndrome-126e4c4bdcc)\n\nThere's also a growing feeling among young people that they're doing something wrong if they don't have Imposter Syndrome, and there are articles on that too. [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/you-don-t-have-impostor-syndrome-you-re-not-doing-it-right-1.3565766](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/you-don-t-have-impostor-syndrome-you-re-not-doing-it-right-1.3565766)\n\nThat's a lot about not having Imposter Syndrome, but if you really do feel insecure, know that you'll grow past it, slowly and incrementally. Expect to keep learning, but actually make a plan and do it. Look at your older work and recognize (hopefully) how far you've come. Don't focus on it, focus on what you can do \u2013 learning, creating new work, connecting with other designers \u2013\u00a0and do that.",

            "That thinking (\"industry standard\") is somewhat outdated now, but of course the more people who maintain it, the more it stays true to some degree. Since many agencies only use Macs (some non-agencies as well, but to a lesser degree) so not being willing to learn to use a PC/Windows or in some cases not having that experience already can hurt your chances of working in those places.\n\nThere's no document anyone can point to that says \"Mac is the Graphic Design industry standard\". But when design went digital in the late 80s/early 90s, design software was only made for Mac, and even when they started making PC versions years later, they were unstable and inferior. And once you spent thousands for a Mac and software in that time period (maybe $12-$15k in today's money), you're not going to consider switching to a PC to save a little money but that requires you to buy all new software as well as hardware \u2013 and doesn't work as well. Also, for designers and print vendors, PCs' handling of color in the early days was extremely lacking. So these are the reasons (some of them, anyway) that the thinking is so entrenched in this industry.\n\nI've only used Mac OS from college until the present, except for about 5 months last year where I had to use a PC for a period of time (and a Mac as well) at my new company while some security things were being worked out to get the Mac fully operational. I can tell you I have a very strong preference for Mac OS and that was strongly reinforced in those months. My brain has been trained to think in Mac and I work very fast and efficiently on them. I've been using some keyboard shortcuts for 30 years \u2013 I don't have to think on a Mac whereas on a PC, I had to think about even small things like where to put my fingers much less locating files. I find the Mac OS more natural, but why wouldn't I after all that time? In my opinion, it looks better than Windows, is more stable, comes with more built-in utility apps, works well with my iPhone and iPad (of course), Airdropping huge files (20 GB+) between devices, Time Machine backup that lets me restore any version of any file backed up... being able to preview files (even multi-page PDFs) quickly and easily (by hitting the spacebar) \u2013\u00a0even while you're browsing to upload a file and you need to make sure it's the right version \u2013 is invaluable. Many of the features that Windows has that have made it better over the years were taken from MacOS years after Mac introduced them, so even if you use both OSes for a while and don't mind the differences, you have to imagine using them daily for your job 10, 15, 20 years ago and the variance was much greater.\n\nIf you use both and you don't see enough of a difference to care, that's an advantage. But you really have to use them daily, for your job, to get a real sense of which OS works better for you. A casual \"I tried \\_\\_\\_\\_ for a few minutes and it didn't seem that different\" (not that you've said that, but others sometimes do) isn't the same.",
            "While PlasmicSteve already had a good reply, I wanted to give my own take. \n\nYou can use whatever you want, between Mac and Windows. If you don't want a Mac, or don't want to spend the extra on a Mac, then don't get one.\n\nWhile you may need to know how to use a Mac in some jobs, if you are even remotely comfortable with computers this should not be an issue. If you can use Windows you can use Mac and vice versa. Especially when we're talking about people who are supposed to know how to use fairly advance software like Photoshop, if someone claims they struggle with either one they're either lying or have a mental block. ie. They just don't want to do it. \n\nI used both Macs and Windows from around 1994 to 2013. Macs had an edge in the 90s for sure, but by the 2000s you could do well enough on PC. By the time Windows 7 came around the difference was less, and even less with Windows 10. Sure you can have preferences but in terms of being able to use what you want, you could use either.\n\nI ditched Apple entirely in 2013, including iPhone, and haven't had any issues. I've considered going back a few times but it's just not worth the added cost or limitations. Apple has, for a while now, been a lifestyle brand first and foremost, rather than a more functional brand as they were in past decades.",

            "There is no easy way to answer this, especially not knowing more about you, the client, and the work involved. Many people will tell you to figure out your hourly rate, multiply it by the time you put into the work, and that's your price. If you don't know your hourly rate, some will tell you to figure out how much you want to work per year, and divide that by the number of hours in a year and you'll get your hourly rate.\n\nI find that when people are asking these questions they don't know those numbers, and in the case of someone wanting to buy, or license, art you've already made, it's even more complex.\n\nSo I will throw out a number of $300 USD. That would be for them to license your art for their album and not to own it exclusively, so they use it for t-shirts or other promotional products without paying you more.\n\nThis number is on the low side but not embarrassingly low. Since you're asking about it here and since you're saying you haven't done this before, it's a reasonable starting point at least. A more well known artist would probably be in the low thousands for licensing existing art, and more than that if they were creating custom art and selling all the rights. \n\nI hope that helps. Try that number on for size and more importantly, learn more about the client and feel them out as much as you can to see if you should be charging more.",

For people in the U.S. and other countries where pay is higher, there's already been a push toward outsourcing to countries where pay is less so the client's dollar is valued more and therefore they can pass less for design. Competition sites like 99 Designs hurt us as do low cost services like Fiverr (check out a recent thread for that debate), and companies now are more frequently asking designers to do work, sometimes that takes hours or days, as a \"design test\" during the interview process. Often companies will have an employee learn and do lighter design tasks even if they're not hired or trained as designers. Canva is a good example of a program a lot of marketers use. \n\nConsolidated, the idea of design becoming a commodity rather than being seen as a craft and a service is what's hurting us.

You also get their phone numbers so you can call and see if they received the mailer. This works much better than any kind of online interaction like social media comment, post, message, email, or whatever because it's more rare, and people are less likely to ignore a nicely designed and printed piece that was sent to them \u2013 especially if you follow up with a phone call.

            "Sure, it can be done. You can DM me a link to your portfolio.\n\nFinding clients when you're new to design is usually the biggest challenge. I recommend creating a print mailer (like a large postcard) that promotes you and your design business, buying/renting a list of names people (owners of small agencies, marketing leads, creative directors, etc.) and contact info for companies near you who may need to hire a designer, send out the mailer and then do follow-up calls, asking if they received it. Emails won't work \u2013 you need to call.\n\nSome people won't get on the phone, but you can leave a message \u2013\u00a0then follow up by email. Some will get on the phone but most won't have work for you at the moment. For those people you politely and briefly describe your services and ask if you can keep in touch, then ask the best method for communication. Then send them regular emails, postcards, or call them maybe every 1-2 months \u2013 whatever they prefer.\n\nAnd very occasionally you'll get someone who needs design work done immediately, which of course is great.\n\nIt will take time but you can build up a client roster this way. If you do great work and are easy to work with \u2013 but still present yourself as an expert and not just an order-taker \u2013 you'll get repeat business and your clients will recommend you to others, which is how you build a freelance business.",

            "Agreed. I've written blog posts for my former company, copy for client website, ads, and marketing collateral - but I also wrote a YA novel that I self-published and even though all those things count as writing, only the last one was an artistic endeavor.\n\nSame with music and film. I've been in three bands since the nineties, wrote and recorded music, played shows all over\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that was art. I've written short audio tracks for client projects\u00a0\u2013 not art. I shot short videos that I've written (comedy, horror) but I've shot and edited tons of product demo videos, customer testimonials, and promo videos. (yes, I've experienced all the examples I gave firsthand) The first were art, the second were not. But they were all pretty fun!\n\nI've worked as an illustrator as long as I've been a designer. That one probably has the most gray area as to whether or not it's true capital-A Art. I did a bunch of spot and cover illustrations for magazines and newspapers in the 90s. Usually I'd read an article or be given a very simple 1-3 sentence brief. Then I'd sketch, submit, make revisions based on feedback, usually ink and color. That kind of project has a lot more freedom than, say, writing brochure copy \u2013 but I still wasn't totally free in what I could draw. I was drawing local celebrities, characters in very specific situations, people using products \u2013 I wouldn't have sat down to draw any of that in the first place had someone not contracted me to do it. So, not true Art, but artistic/creative.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!",

            "At that point it comes down to semantics. What does a word like \"art\" or \"design\" mean? \n\nIn the end I'm sure we can all agree that there is one thing people do that is totally free from outside rules and constraints, and another thing people do that isn't. I go with the general idea that Art, or Fine Art, is the name we use for the first thing and Design falls into the latter realm. So while I can agree that design can of course be creative, I would never say it's Art because that breaks the definition. Maybe your teacher was thinking of Creativity where I'm using Art here. But the word/definition I'm using for Art/Fine Art is the one I've found most people use and accept.\n\nI agree (and it's almost pointless to even say that) with the idea that Creativity can be present in all careers and disciplines.",

It can contain art, can contain photography... But it doesn't mean it's photography anymore than its art. \n\nI saw your other reply where you say that is someone does something creative you'd say that's art and they're an artist - personally I definitely wouldn't say I'm an artist and even go as far as to say I really wouldn't like to be described as such. I would say I'm a designer - digital, web, print, UI/UX, I'm a designer...

Everyone was out of sync with everyone else on an app-to-app basis. It sucked. Individuals and businesses weighed the \"should I update now?\" decision very heavily, which is not a good thing.\n\nI still see some of that with InDesign but that's largely due to ID being the only one where each version renders all newly created/revised files incompatible with prior editions. So if I open a file in ID v16, I can't open it in ID v14 (unless it was saved as an IDML in advance). We update everything else pretty much when it drops, but always wait on ID to ensure it's working fine and then coordinate across the team. \n\n(Since if we update to ID 16 and it's a buggy launch, we can't just revert back to ID 15 because now anything we worked on won't open.)\n\nBut yeah you don't see the same variance anymore where this guy is CS2 and this guy is CS4 and this guy is pre-CC. Or they only budgeted for 1-2 upgrades so the AD and senior get the new version while the rest of the team is on an older version.",

        "content": "\nI'm going to tell you a story about how I landed a graphic design job almost three years after graduating with a bachelor's degree in graphic design, only to get somewhat fired on my first day.\n\nAlmost three years ago, in 2021, amidst all the COVID-19 chaos, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in graphic design. It was a huge accomplishment, especially considering it took me a while to finish college. I started off in community college, studying studio art, and didn't think I would ever complete my degree. However, my parents and siblings pushed me to finish, so I transferred to a university and earned my bachelor's in graphic design.\n\nDuring my time at university, I contemplated switching to computer science but decided to stick with graphic design since I had so many art credits from community college. I enjoyed my courses and did well overall. After graduating, I applied to many jobs but struggled to land one. UPS offered me a job but retracted it, saying I didn't seem enthusiastic during the interview.\n\nFrustrated, I joined a coding bootcamp to switch to web development. Although it was challenging, I had more interviews in web development than in graphic design, which is a more saturated field.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago, in 2024, I was still applying for design jobs. I had several interviews, but one stood out. I'm a Christian, and I always worried about how my faith might conflict with my work. This job, however, was owned by a Christian and had Christian themes throughout the workplace. The owner invited me to try the job for two days to see if I liked it. If I did, we would proceed with the hiring process; if not, I could just collect my pay for those two days.\n\nI accepted and went in for the first day. After six hours, the owner let me go, saying, \"I'll pay you for your time, but I can tell you're not what we're looking for.\" apparently, I was slow on the production side and did not receive much training due to the fact that it was a small business. He even said \"I thought you were a D E S I G N E R\", but I also knew web design, UX design, and more. so yes I know I'm a designer but I just was not familiar with the software that they were using at this company. \n\n His comment made me feel inadequate, and I left in tears. It was disheartening, especially after all the time spent applying, changing careers, and working odd jobs. During that day, I asked a coworker for help with unfamiliar software, and she retorted, \"Didn't you go to college for this?\" I was offended and realized how harsh the working world can be.\n\nCurrently, I'm still unemployed and finding it very difficult to get a job. I've stopped pursuing graphic design jobs and am now focusing on software engineering or IT, something more profitable. I can do graphic design on the side, but I'm not banking on it as a career anymore. \n\nThis experience has been a tough lesson, and while I don't want to discourage anyone pursuing graphic design, I advise against assuming it will be an easy path.\n\n\n\n**********************************************************\n\n\nEdit: The software used was called Composer and we also used high-tech vinyl printers.  Also if it was Adobe then I wouldn't have said \"software\" ",

        "content": "My company unfortunately uses LinkedIn and Indeed EasyApply. Which means death to my time and energy. \n\nThe resumes flow through our HR/Payroll portal and I flag resumes to be screened by HR. I spend 30 minutes to an hour every morning dumping all the resumes that are unqualified:\n\n*High school grad who works at Applebees\n\n*Entry level junior designer\n\n*UX front end developer who doesn\u2019t even mention using Adobe\n\n*Doesn\u2019t have a portfolio link (I\u2019ve made one exception to this so far because their resume checked every single box AND they had a super informative cover letter)\n\n*Their salary is way ($20k+) out of range\n\nAfter weeding out bulk, I read whats left. I\u2019m ADHD, so I have to randomize my approach or all the words will turn to jibberish. I randomly click a candidate in the list. \n\nRead about their last two jobs and open their portfolio. If I don\u2019t see any representation of those jobs in their portfolio, they\u2019ve immediately lost muster and I realize their portfolio is not up to date. If their resume is well designed, easy to read, and their work history is super relevant, I\u2019ll give their recent employers a quick google to see what their brand presence is. If I can\u2019t garner the contribution the applicant made to their last couple jobs, onto the next. I need recent work, y\u2019all. \n\nI\u2019m reading hundreds of resumes. I need a cleanly organized and blocked out resume. I want to see how this designer handles copy-heavy design. This is part of the gig. How do you take a wall of text and let the user enjoy reading it? If the resume is ill-formatted, I\u2019m either consciously rejecting this candidate or subconsciously soured and probably will find other reasons to reject them. \n\nA few important points:\n\n*I do not use a bot or ATS or AI to read these. I\u2019m a whole ass person with time limitations but I care about who I hire.\n\n*Be efficient and effective with your language. I can smell filler and bullshit a mile away. \n\n*NAME YOUR FILES. Put your full name and \u201cresume\u201d in the name of your PDF. I\u2019ve downloaded 200 resumes. \u201cCV FINAL.pdf\u201d and \u201cResume2.pdf\u201d file names will make me resent you immediately. I\u2019ve already had to rename your files for you. It doesn\u2019t bode well. \n\n*I don\u2019t give a crap if your resume is 2 pages or 2 columns. It\u2019s a PDF. I don\u2019t print them out. I won\u2019t lose the last page. I\u2019d rather know things than not know things that you\u2019ve removed just to smash it all on one page. Also, some negative space is necessary when you\u2019re on your 45th resume of the day. \n\n*Proofread. Have someone else proofread it. I\u2019m going to be approving your work in this role and I am not going to want to waste my time correcting your spelling and casing.\n\n*Your portfolio needs to showcase the skills you\u2019re applying for. Many designers are multi-faceted, but only show their favorite or flashiest work in their portfolio. If you\u2019re applying for a UI role, why do you only have motion graphics and logo work in your portfolio?\n\n*I read cover letters. Especially well formatted cover letters that show me who you are and what you\u2019re about. This is an opportunity to tell me why you are my unicorn. What makes you a great employee and an excellent designer. Show your personality. Form cover letters are pointless and a waste of my time. I know where I work and what your name is. Why are you awesome for this job?\n\nAfter all of this, I have to wait for HR to do the phone screen, then I follow up to book first round virtual interviews. I\u2019m at this stage right now. \n\nI hope this is helpful. If it is, I\u2019m happy to follow up and give insights into what I\u2019m finding and looking for from the interview stages as well. \n\n\nEDIT: Hey y\u2019all. To those DMing me, I wish I had time to do some resume and portfolio reviews right now. As you can see, I have my work cut out for me with this process on top of my regular projects. Maybe once I get further down the line, I\u2019ll have the capacity. Best of luck to all of you!! \ud83d\udda4",

The standard advice is MUST FIT 1 PAGE. Personally, I don't care; it's digital, and it takes a millisecond to scroll; 2 pages are fine... as long as it's warranted. This doesn't mean balloon everything, give icons etc, it still needs to be formatted correctly, just the whole 1-page thing isn't as much of a stress\n\nI think outside of design, and maybe creative industries in general, this is still a rigid rule. But then again, my partner who's a vet nurse, her and all her friends CV's go on for 2/3 pages due to the quals and CPD and various other things they state they've had training in,and for that professional, that's standard\n\nSo I think this is a good point and something not to stress about, I want to understand your roles and responsibilities, what you've done, the work, what you managed and were in charge of and any stat to back up your work - wed designer for example... has your designs increases bounce rate, traffic, sales conversations, events etc",

I would still consider that person if their work is presented well. I respect people who put their real work into their portfolio. Or have i misunderstood your terms of relevancy? \n\nIf a person of 5-6 years experience has one online portfolio, are they expected to have multiple portfolios to cater to different jobs they are applying for? Or should they just not apply at all if their relevancy is low? Just because I am applying to one job that is a UI role, do I need to take out all my motion graphics and logo work in my portfolio to cater to that one application?",
            "This helps to highlight how important it is to have a network and to know the hiring team before you apply and, conversely, how difficult it can be to cold apply to roles. It also helps applicants understand that their idea of how to demonstrate their ability may not be the same as how a hiring manager chooses to discern ability from applicants.\n\nHiring managers need some kind of methodology to sort through the stack and it will always be imperfect and often can disqualify very capable and skilled designers who simply have the bad luck of triggering one of the hiring manager\u2019s personalized knockout filters. It can be a definite guessing game and be very exhausting when you are applying to hundreds of companies, each with their own unknowable system for how they believe they can find talent at the cost they are willing to pay.\n\nGood luck and be easy on yourselves, folks looking for work right now.",

From experience, when working a current full time job or juggling multiple freelance projects, the amount of time you have to prepare for every application / interview is minimal.

If you're an actual designer put in charge of hiring, hopefully you are experienced enough to handle that at the time, but most people who hire (in any industry) never received formal training, they figured it out as they went or just learned from their boss at the time. People new to hiring tend to make mistakes (myself included when I was new), so you can't expect it to go perfectly. \n\nIf you are not a designer, it will be tougher because you're trying to evaluate people outside of your area of expertise. \n\nRegardless, a lot of people newer to hiring tend to be too nice, and approach things as if the people are in front of them when looking through applicants. Set standards, stick to them. You don't need to rush a hire, you don't need to pick someone if you have doubts or just don't like them (whether around merit or personality). Don't try to talk yourself into people, go by your own experience and instincts. \n\nIf someone has a bad portfolio or a lot of mistakes, just reject and move on. If in an interview there's someone where you think \"I guess in a pinch they could be okay,\" don't hire them, keep going and looking at other people. \n\nDon't approach it as if you're just trying to get it done with as fast as possible. Take your time, learn about applicants, get them to talk, don't feed them answers.",
            "Unfortunately I think it depends. In a perfect world, f you\u2019re sending a pdf portfolio then yes I think it helps to curate it a bit. If you\u2019re sending a website link then it\u2019s understandable that you won\u2019t be adjusting it for every job you apply to. To me, this is where a cover letter really shines. You can highlight your relevant experience and tell me why your outside skills and experience will be an asset to the desired job. Obviously you can reiterate that in an interview, but you gotta get there first.",
            "I\u2019m in a very niche industry, so it\u2019s very rare to find people with the specific experience I\u2019m looking for. \n\nSo I have to step back and look at the skills utilized to do the work. This is something that gets easier to analyze over time. You learn to connect the dots between seemingly disparate mediums and subject matter and find the common thread. \n\nI would be looking at their skills in brand building. Are they able to create cohesive and engaging assets across multiple applications: Web, social, corporate communication, packaging, etc. Do they know how to maintain and follow brand guidelines or are they starting from scratch every project? Do they play too much? Are they too sterile? There\u2019s a sweet spot where compelling and clean design overlap and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. \n\nIf they\u2019re in a higher level role, how have they sold their projects to you? Do they know how to explain and communicate about their work? Would you feel comfortable bringing them to client or leadership meetings to pitch concepts? Do you want them in your corner when you\u2019re trying to push a change that others are against or confused about?\n\nAlso, do they know how to talk about your industry in interviews? Have they done any cursory research into your company or field? Do they seem way too out of their depth to learn quickly? Or maybe they have a passion for what you do but never had the opportunity to work in it. Sometimes the biggest obstacle isn\u2019t designing for a new industry, but understanding the needs and nuances to work within it. What are we selling, why are we selling it, and who are we selling it to? If they don\u2019t fully grasp at least two of those within the first couple months of work, they won\u2019t be very effective.",
            "I don't do Web so i don't have an online portfolio, but I do have several portfolios for different avenues of design. eg one is art focused, other is print/industrial focused, third is visual identity/employer branding/corporate focused, and a separate demo reel for mograph.",
            "That's why it's so important for people to do a great job at handling what is within their control, even if there's this other side that is unpredictable or subjective. \n\nAs we see here though, so many (especially those that are struggling more) are *not* doing that. They have too few projects, the work simply isn't good, the presentation has little or no thought put into it, it's sloppy. A surprisingly high number of portfolios posted here have spelling errors that spellcheck would catch, for example. They'll have bullet points in a resume that aren't even aligned properly, have sub-heads changing size from one to the next, just really avoidable mistakes. \n\nSo even though you could do everything \"right\" and still be rejected based on the specific system of a given hiring manager, unless someone is doing all they can do best present themselves, it's pointless to focus too much on the subjective aspect.",
            "If the work is public it's hard for a company to defend that, but if being a hassle just password protect the portfolio, or send a PDF which isn't online. \n\nI'd also suggest not asking past/current employers for permission, they'll tend to default to \"no.\" \n\nIn-house shouldn't matter though, just about whether the work is public or not. If not, do what you can to remove sensitive aspects, such as using ChatGPT to redo internal/proprietary copy, or adjusting designs to remove anything that would be detrimental if publically released. \n\n>I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair point to say a \u201cportfolio isn\u2019t up to date\u201d if the rest of the work is good.\n\nStep back and view the whole context. This is midlevel, so usually 2-7 year range, probably more often 2-5, so if someone doesn't have work from the last few years or few jobs, that probably means they have little or nothing since college. That is definitely a problem if all they have to show is basically what they had when applying to junior roles. \n\nAdditionally, it's a competition. Being fine in a bubble doesn't matter if you have even 40-50 people who are \"fine\" or better. If you have doubts about someone at the portfolio stage, you're not going to bother trying to make a case for them, because you're not going to do 50 interviews. You'll just reject them and move onto the next person. \n\nAs long as enough other people are showing better work and/or doing a better job presenting it, you'll get passed on.",

That very disrespect for each other's time leads to applicants wasting your time in turn throwing out hail mary's from applebees and junior design positions since the default consideration has become apply for everything with a generic application. Throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks is remarkably effective when spending time to tailor everything, though effective and recommended, reduces one's ability for raw processing.

So when you get a new job, save the posting you applied to for that job, because that's how they defined it. But also, when applying to a new job, use their posting to adjust your resume to highlight key things that align. \n\nOf course, most of what we see here are people who summarize a job by vague points that would describe *any* design job, and if they have multiple design jobs will just rephrase the same things for each job. (In some cases I think they literally did that.)\n\nYou can't actually tell what they did at all.

One of my guys has been with my firm for about 10 years now -- he's in his 60's with almost 40 years of design experience, prefers production work only, likes to come and go as he pleases, and basically wants to be comfortable until he retires. By far the best employee I've ever had as he's friendly, social, good natured, knows his shit, and hard working when needed. So, in turn, I give him all the freedoms. He doesn't even care about money; his quality of life is that he can enjoy his job, then go home and work on building his Catio (enclosed patio for his cat). \n\nThe thing is, he's a Boomer, I'm a Gen-Xer, and we both have a very solid work ethic while also being relaxed with a go-with-the-flow attitude; sense of humor is a must. I've had a lot of problems with Millennials being uptight job hoppers with cocky attitudes and extremely high salary/benefit expectations that fold under the first sign of pressure. Not all of them have been that way, but a surprising majority. I've actually had fewer problems with the Gen-Zers coming out of college... they seem to be a bit more relaxed and open to learning, and more appreciative of the job. They won't stay forever but usually long enough to learn and grow their skills and become good contributors.

If someone one has been in the workforce as long as the people I\u2019m looking for, these are rookie mistakes and signs of a laziness I don\u2019t have time to train out of someone. I want someone who is better at what they do than I am. I\u2019m involved in a lot of projects with a lot of departments and stakeholders.

In your summary could even explain that you made some changes to adhere to these requirements. \n\nAnd if you think or know that they're stalking you, definitely password protect that.",
            "I totally see your point. Our company is going through a bit of a culture shift right now. A lot of the leadership is trying to calibrate salaries of current employees to be within market range. It\u2019s also tricky because we are in NJ. Which means we get applicants who think we are paying the NYC market rates, when we are very much in the local NJ job market. We don\u2019t expect people from Brooklyn to work here so we don\u2019t pay NYC cost of living. It helps to level set expectations right out of the gate while our company works out the kinks with our focus on recruitment and retention. \n\nAs I said. I\u2019m in-house.

My boss is awesome and does a great job advocating for new standards to improve morale and retention. \n\nBut yeah, the people I rejected were brand spanking new to the workforce.

You could have small, subtle links to the specific projects in your portfolio showing the actual package design, social media campaign, or whatever. \nI would make this in InDesign, importing any needed assets from my body of work, then export to PDF or whatever is required to where I\u2019m posting.\nI actually might have to do this just to work it out!

If they didn't mention it, you'd have to assume that's intentional, because they don't know it.\n\n> Salary expectation (this one might be on you)\n\nThey mentioned if the role is $20k outside the *range*. People can definitely aim for whatever they want, but doesn't mean they are worth it, nor that the employer has to agree. I once had a junior with about 2-3 years experience (and work reflecting that) want a senior salary. Good for them, maybe they'd find it, just not getting it from me. If I'm paying a senior salary, I'd want a senior level designer. \n\n> Showing recent work\n\nI can't see where they mentioned this, but if hiring a midlevel (usually 2-7 year range), you would hope the person has some more recent work and it's not all from 4+ years ago. \n\n> Cover letters lol everyone uses ChatGPT for those now because they are the stupidest thing ever invented\n\nCover letters are meant to highlight aspects of the candidate beyond the resume, or address specifics that may not be apparent.
