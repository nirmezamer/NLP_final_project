Even as recent as Donda, a song like Jesus Lord shows how perceptive Kanye can be. But that is completely missing on Vultures, he\u2019s leaned into the playful side but not in a way that\u2019s new or at the very least funny in most cases, just lewd. Ty ain\u2019t much better but at least he got that heavenly ass voice. Ntm Kanye along wit his mediocre bars doesn\u2019t even sound energised for parts of the album. Legit never heard him so disengaged on an album of his like this before\n\nI actually do like the song vultures tho",
            "Yeah he did great, I never said he was ass . He just didn\u2019t do as good as Ye, but that\u2019s because that was Kanye at his lyrical prime so on the album as a whole he performed better than Jay.",

Plus he\u2019s showing a whole other level with Vultures 2 imo that he\u2019s more than capable, the album was supposed to be lewd and stuff, it\u2019s a Ty$ collab album for gods sake",
            "Nah I get it being Lewd but it ain\u2019t even like entertaining to me, I ain\u2019t asking for groundbreaking shit but if the music ain\u2019t engaging, then it just isn\u2019t good enough. I don\u2019t think the album is ass, I\u2019d give it like a solid 6/10 but it just doesn\u2019t really have replay value compared to even his other collab albums. Vultures II does look good but it ain\u2019t even out so ig we\u2019ll see what he brings",
            "It\u2019s only one installment of this collab album though which means it\u2019s not the fully complete fleshed out idea. I understand that some of it can be eh but it\u2019s overall pretty good imo and I enjoyed Ye\u2019s performance",
            "It\u2019s not exactly some deep concept that it needs multiple instalments to be understood. It\u2019s shallow club music, and considering the album is able to stand by itself, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019ve only got one instalment. I\u2019m hopeful for vultures II but it is really its own thing, we can\u2019t say they require each other to make sense",
            "In terms of their collabs and it literally being called Vultures 2 and it being planned to have 3 installments from the beginning, I\u2019m saying that they\u2019re probably better together. Yes they\u2019re way different in theme but we haven\u2019t even seen their full vision, and I enjoy the 1st one so it\u2019s whatever imo"

We got a snippet of Love Me the Most (The only snippet that had Ye vocals). \n\n- The other choices were City Underground (only Ty) and Aperol Spritz (Ty and mystery artist). \n\n- Ye is most likely having a show in Korea in August. \n\n- Ty and Ye are both in Paris. \n\n- Ty has a show Saturday in a club again and theres a chance that Ye might show up.\n\n-  Aus (The guy doing all the creative stuff for the shows) visited multiple stadium in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. \n\n- Aus and Ty linked up with Westside Gunn. \n\n- We Love You is an unheard Vultures track. \n\n- Ye and Ty performed Carnival in Tokyo during a Wrestling event called Wangmania. \n\n- Saint Leon invited a basketball player (Wemby) to a \"Vultures party\" this weekend. might be a reference to the club event Ty has planned where Ye might go or a private listening party like ones months ago. \n\n- Not Inclusive was brought back to Vultures 2. The version of this song we \"heard\" recently was AI.\n\n- Star Time is also brought back but with a different name. \n\n- Ty did an interview with Billboard and said the Vultures 1 rollout was \"fucking perfect\".\n\n- He also states that the album could drop any day but the interview is from May 16th. \n\n- As of May 16th, Vultures was still a trilogy. \n\nhave a good day everyone!!
