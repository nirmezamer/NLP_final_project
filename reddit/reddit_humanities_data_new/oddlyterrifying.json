Something I dearly miss, that I did not appreciate enough, perhaps, when I was younger, is when we disagreed, as it opened incredibly interesting topics and discussions. I hate it that I have seldom seen anyone, if ever, have anything like that, it is always vicious, oblivious, \"I say my piece just to tell my slogan, don't care what you say, I won't listen to it, I will make up what you said based on the words that my brain picks up as offensive/recognizes, no matter the context\" or \"I will silence you and keep talking/talk over you\", this is how children quarrel. People I have around these days are also of this type, so I guess it is not only restricted to the Internet, but it breaks my heart to know that \\*that\\* is almost \"normal\" these days, horrible. I am glad some people do what you described if it means being able to speak, like preparing a parachute when one takes the jump, that is one good use of this karma thing for sure, thank you for letting me know!",

We just get notified sometimes of posts that are reported a ton. The biggest thing that helps is using mod mail if something is really out of place. \n\nEven then, its difficult. There's no winning for us. Its really hard to keep the vision of the subreddit without smothering the fanbase and getting complaints. \n\n\"Oh, you removed my post? But its related to the subreddit, these guys are power mods that just spend all their time removing everything!\"\n\nSo you try to be a little more relaxed with moderating posts. Then it turns into:\n\n\"This sub has gone to shit! None of the posts are really what the sub is for!\"\n\nModerating tools are pretty minimal, we basically purely rely on the community to tell us which things to look into. And a lot of the reported stuff actually ends up being perfectly fine. We're not given much of a heads up on posts that dont fit the subreddit, and the stuff that actually doesnt fit gets diluted and buried by people reporting posts that do fit. And youd have to spend a ton of unpaid time to work on some sort of solution to take care of reposts and karma farming bots (which is an EXTREME amount of time spent coding bots to detect it, only for the bots to resurface around your system).\n\nMost people moderate out of the goodness in their heart.

Before I went to tell my mom I did that thing you see in the movies\u2026passed my hand over his eyes to pull his eyelids down. I felt really stupid because it definitely didn\u2019t work, they popped right back open.",
            "Just another reason my family believes in cremation.  I don\u2019t want anyone looking at me dead for a long time.. \nlol I have been resisted  \ud83e\udd14 have been seen dead.",

            "Oooh my dad\u2019s eyes got donated when I was little too! Trauma twinsies. \n\nBut we had him cremated and had a memorial service, no wake or viewing. \n\nI really can\u2019t understand why they would use cotton balls of all things?",
            "It's not for everyone. When my grandmother died, my mother took pictures of her. It was the last time we would ever get to see her.\n\nSome people just want to be able to say goodbye.",
            "I work with young people, and have been to some open caskets for children...that's even wilder.",

            "This is what I don\u2019t get either. I don\u2019t want my last memory of a loved one to be them laying lifeless in a box.  I also understand some see this as being at peace and may be better than their last moments alive too, so I can see it being a personal preference.",
            "Yep.  Burn me, give me to science, let med students work out how I died, whatever.  Just don't display me in front of my kids/grandkids/friends as a corpse.  I was a vibrant being of light, not a lifeless plank of flesh.  Remember how I was!",
            "I wanted to see my mum in the chapel of rest after she died, but I couldn\u2019t get there and didn\u2019t have childcare. My mum died suddenly and I was struggling to believe that she was really gone. I\u2019m still angry I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to her, 2 years later.",
            "Yeah, I understand that. I remember my cousins and I didn't want to see her but it was important to my mother and uncle. I may feel differently about my own parents one day.",
            "Yeah, I find it really important personally...I feel like seeing the body gives me closure, it's much harder for me to process grief when I haven't been able to see someone I love knowing that this is the last time. \n\nDifferent strokes for different folks I guess!",

            "I found my mom dead when I was 46 and I will never forget it. Or the 911 operator arguing with me and telling me to give her CPR when she was already cold.",
            "I'm sorry you had to go through that.",
            "Sorry, that person is obviously too dense to be an operator",
            "I'm getting over it but maybe it'd be a different scenario if your parents were elderly. Like a send off. She was 49 and it was semi unexpected.",
            "It was bad enough to see her sprawled on the floor and touch her once and realize she was gone. I wasn't touching her again and giving her CPR! It was awful.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I found my mom, too. Fortunately no trauma was involved, but still, it was an experience I will never forget. It was a shock to my core, and yet I had a sense of peace because she no longer suffered."
