Check out our [list of removed topics here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics)\n\n* **\n\n\n# Game updates\n* **What was in the last update?**  \n  See release notes [for PC](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History), [for consoles](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Console_Version_History), and [for mobile](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mobile_Version_History).\n\n   See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n* **Are future releases planned?**  \nStardew Valley 1.5 was released on PC in late December 2020 and console in February 2021. Android/iOS received the 1.5 update in early January 2023. Stardew Valley 1.6 released on 19 March 2024 on PC. [Console release to follow ASAP](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762192764899627457).\n\n* **Does every platform get the same content/updates?**  \n  Mostly yes. Updates are developed for Linux/Mac/Windows first, then ported to other platforms. There are customizations for each platform (like tap to move on mobile), but otherwise content is identical across all platforms. See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n  The exceptions are PS Vita (which won't get any further content updates [due to platform limitations](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1232797409010278400)), and Android/iOS (which will continue getting all updates, but [don't support multiplayer](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1262068497086967808) or Chinese translations).\n\n* **Is Stardew Valley on XBox GamePass?**\n\n     Stardew Valley is on XBox GamePass as of December 2, 2021. See [here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/12/01/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-december-2021/) for details.\n\n# Multiplayer\n* **How does multiplayer work?**  \n  See [Multiplayer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer) on the wiki.\n\n* **Is crossplay supported?**  \n   All PC players can play together, whether they're on Linux/Mac/Windows or GOG/Steam. [Console crossplay isn't supported](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1036993838613651459), and mobile versions don't have multiplayer.\n\n* **Is split-screen supported?**  \n  Yep, split-screen was added on PC and console in Stardew Valley 1.5.\n\n* **Will Android/iOS get multiplayer?**  \n  There are [no current plans for multiplayer on mobile](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1262068497086967808) (including split-screen multiplayer).\n\n* **Will the 1.6 update apply to my current game?**  \n  Yes! New updates always apply to existing saves.\n\n# Other\n* **Can I transfer saves between devices?**  \n   You can [transfer saves](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Transfer_a_save) between Android, iOS, and PC (Linux/Mac/Windows).\n\n   Consoles unfortunately don't let you access the save files. The Switch version also has a different format that's not compatible with other platforms (the format used by other consoles is unknown).\n\n* **How do I take a screenshot of my full farm?**  \n  See [this guide to taking farm screenshots](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/how-to-share-your-farm-and-use-stardew-planner.152/).\n\n* **If I buy the game on one platform, can I get it for free on a different one?**  \n   If you buy it on PC, you get the Linux + macOS + Windows versions; if you buy it on PS4, you get the PS4 + PS Vita versions. Otherwise each platform is a different edition with separate development, so you'll need to buy it again if you want it on a different platform.\n\n* **Where can I report bugs?**  \n  1. If you use mods, see the [troubleshooting guide](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Troubleshooting) first.\n  2. If you use mods and the bug disappears when playing without them (by running `Stardew Valley.exe` directly in [your game folder](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_folder)), report it to r/SMAPI or see [Modding:Help](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Help).\n  2. If it happens without mods, report it in the official [bug report forum](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/), which the game developers keep an eye on.\n\n* **How do I use or create mods?**  \n   See the pinned thread in r/SMAPI for more info, and feel free to ask questions in r/SMAPI!",

I\u2019m wondering now how best to go about it. I browsed through some of the resources here, are these still valid (read: up to date)? like the permanent missable content i have to watch out for?

            "Learn from my near mistakes:\nI use the automate mod (which I adore) and I had an idea to set up an elaborate crab pot empire with attached worm bins and fish smokers to keep the rube goldberg money machine printing. \n\nTurns out the Fish Smoker needs coal (which I imagine most other people realize) and even with the artisan/angler perks, the fish should have a base price of 90g to compensate for the 250g a piece of coal costs in Year 2. Crabs and lobsters are the only crab-pot fishables that have a base price greater than 90g, so smoking anything else from those pots will end up losing money. \n\nFYI - Most normal tier fish have a base price less than 90g while most silver+ fish have a price greater than 90. The tier carries over while smoking, so in a reverse of fruits and vegetables, you'll want to process your highest quality fish and just sell most of the low quality stuff.",

I wouldn't worry beyond following those and chipping away at the CC.

            "There's not really any \"doing it wrong\" in the game. Apart from the choice between restoring the Community Center or not, almost everything else can be changed at a later point, though some things are quite costly to change. For most things, like crops, community center items and fish, the worst case is that you need to wait until next year before you get another shot. The most intricate parts of the community center bundles involve getting quality (gold star) crops and all the fish, where some fish require certain weather, time and/or season to be caught.\n\nAll the seeds are profitable, so plant what you want, just try to keep a steady cashflow going as lacking money is the one thing that might block you from progressing. Take some notes of things you need to remember, like quests or birthdays you want to gift someone an item for. As you keep doing one activity, you will skill up in it and become more efficient in it, spending less energy and getting higher quality items and more profits.\n\nIf you truly want to min-max everything in the game and quickly get to maximum profits and do everything, it will be overwhelming for sure. If it helps, you can make up some rules on what to do on each day based on your luck and the weather. If it rains, you don't need to water, so you have a lot of time to clear debris on your farm, organize chests, cook, craft and hand out gifts. On lucky days, it's very useful to go to the mines as you will find ladders quicker. If you are able to progress a full 5 floors in the mines, the elevator will let you start from there. And attempting to clear 5-10 levels every lucky day is a nice goal. If you have trouble there, you can craft staircases that turn into ladders when plopped down on the ground. Costs 99 stone and can be crafted after reaching mining level 2.",

Explore, talk to villagers (even the mean ones), do quests from the bulletin board, go into the mines, do the community centre when that opens up, etc.\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to play, but it CAN seem overwhelming at first, especially if you don't know the game well enough to have any kind of set plan in mind.

Leveling your skills gives you access to new equipment that starts to make everything faster and more convenient. \n\n>It also seems that by the time I walk to town, my character needs to sleep, so then it's time to walk home.\n\nThis might be due to having planted a bit too much for your current set of tools ie. it takes you all day to water everything because you have a basic watering can and no sprinklers. Which is fine - you'll make a lot of money and level farming up quickly that way. But maybe try planting just a bit less next season so you can spend some time in the afternoons going fishing, mining, or foraging.\n\nAlso check out the community centre, it gives you a steady progression of goals + rewards.",

            "Well for your grandfather's side of things it's rather simple actually. Have high relationship with many different villagers, at least 8, max out pet, make at least 1m gold, level up your skills to at least 30 in total, complete the community center, get to bottom of the mines, have access to the sewer, then completely ship every crop or artisan good, catch every fish, complete the museum, upgrade the house at least twice and be married. Now not all of this needs to be done. If you have made 1m gold then you are more than half way to the requirement to max out your grandfather. Even if you don't max him you can always just go to his shrine again and he will judge again till he is happy. Best part of the game is you can go at your pace. No rush to do anything, can always try again next year.\n\nBut If your trying to get the most stuff done, I would at least focus on planting 15 of every crop and shipping them and making all the artisan goods you can and ship those also. plus try and catch all the legendary fish, because the fifth one can only be caught in spring but have to get all the others from each season first, and the sewer naturally. Maxing out all your skills will help, fishing gets easier with more skill points and better fishing poles.",
            "Really depends on how you're playing. Optimized playthrough you can have max hearts with everyone (14 on spouse, 8 on other romance options, 10 on everyone else), shipped one of everything, polyculture+monoculture achievements (shipping 15 of every farm crop, shipping 100 of one farm crop), completed CC, reached 100+ in Skull Cavern, crafted one of everything, fished one of everything, fully upgraded house, have a kid or two (optional), completed museum (unless you have one or two artifacts that keep eluding you), and reached Perfection (or nearly there). Plus a bunch of other spoiler-ly stuff that's part of the path of reaching all those goals.\n\nBasically it's possible to nearly 100% the game by end of year two. But odds are if this is your first playthrough, you're likely not close to that, so just set your own goals based on the above stuff.\n\nOne tip though: if you want to go for Perfection, that requires a ton of money. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one common method is to set up an Ancient Fruit farm in the Greenhouse, since it produces high-value fruit year-round in there. Getting that up and running takes a lot of time since you need to start with a single Ancient Fruit plant and turn its recurring production into more seeds through the Seed Maker until you eventually fill the Greenhouse completely with Ancient Fruit plants. So it's best to get started early on that if you want to go that route.",

            "The big tips with skull caverns are:\n\nYou can get a desert totem by trading 3 omni geodes for it from the desert trader. This will help you start your next skull cavern run earlier in the day. (every hour makes a difference) You can get staircases by trading Jade on Saturdays. You can also get spicy eel (which is a great buff for a deep run) by trading rubies.\n\nYou need a large stack of highly healing food. Most people either use gold star cheese (which you can make in bulk from large milks) or they buy food from Gus. Comparing the cost and healing of various options, salad is the easiest option to just buy in bulk.\n\nYou also need bombs. The key to go quickly is bombs. Buy a bunch from the dwarf - for a full day if you want to make it down to level 100, you probably want 100 or more bombs. If there's more than two or three rocks within bomb distance, throw down a bomb.\n\nIf you totem in at 6-630am, then just bomb your way down with the rare staircases (primarily for infested levels), you can hit level 100+ relatively easily. You don't need to be quite that aggressive to get plenty of iridium and stone, but even 60+ should get you a good amount. Deeper is better though - iridium spawns go up aggressively with depth.\n\nDon't worry about hitting yourself with the bombs by the way. You can just eat a salad later to get up. Oh, and last tip is just keep fighting till 2am - passing out due to time just gets you 1000g penalty (never items lost), and you'll likely get far more than 1000g worth of stuff with an extra couple hours in there.",
