        "content": "*The mods of /r/sex make it our policy to review the rules of the sub on an ongoing basis, tweaking items as necessary.  In an effort to stay abreast with the growth of the sub and with the evolving moderation that requires, we have decided to re-sticky the updated rules to serve as a reminder for our membership.*\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nr/sex is for civil discussions pertaining to education and advice regarding your sexuality and sexual relationships. It is a sex-positive community and a safe space for people of all genders and orientations which demands respectful conduct in all exchanges.  There is **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CREEPY/HARASSING BEHAVIOR here** \u2014 in posts, comments, messages, or any other contributions. No exceptions.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis is a large community dedicated to an extremely popular topic.  If you wish to participate, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with our rules of conduct **BEFORE** you participate here.  Failure to do so will result in your removal from the community.  \n\n**PLEASE READ** the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index) with the most asked and answered questions - **BEFORE POSTING!!** Posts that do not follow the posting guidelines in the FAQ will be automatically removed.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**THE /R/SEX RULES**\n\n**1) ENGAGE CONSTRUCTIVELY AT ALL TIMES.**   \nThis means ensuring that ALL of your contributions here are constructive, on-topic, mature, sex-positive, civil and respectful.  Disrespectful conduct will see you banned from the community on the spot.  Hitting on other people, asking for pictures (joking or not), making any sort of sexist comment or insult, body shaming, or trolling of any sort will result in your immediate ban.\n\n**2) DON\u2019T SKIP THE FAQ OR THE FORUM RULES.**  \nWe\u2019re serious about this. Dozens of posts get removed every day because they\u2019re covered in the FAQ or violate the forum rules.\n\n**3) DON'T OVERLOOK PAST POSTS.**   \nWe\u2019re serious about this, too. Many questions may be new to you, but are very common in our community. Before you submit a post on a common topic, search the forum.\n\n**4) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE SEX POSITIVE.**   \nWe demand that consenting adults be free to express their sexuality as they see fit. Kink shaming, slut shaming, and similar conduct will not be tolerated.  Links or references to sex negative communities or websites (No Fap, Porn Free, etc) will not be tolerated.  Attacks on the lifestyle of other consenting adults will not be tolerated.\n\n**5) POSTS SEEK ADVICE, COMMENTS PROVIDE IT.**   \nThe main forum is focused primarily on posts seeking specific actionable advice for distinctive personal situations. Giving advice should primarily be done in the comments. General discussions are often allowed, so long as they adhere to the group rules and restricted content guidelines. If you want to make an exception, please request approval from moderators.\n\n**6) DO NOT TROLL OR ENGAGE WITH TROLLS HERE.**   \nDon\u2019t try to challenge, question, tease, fight, or outwit trolls here. Instead, use the Report button to alert moderators, who will review every single reported item.  Trolling of any sort merits an immediate permaban.\n\n**7) ALL DISCUSSION MUST BE DIRECTED INTO THE PUBLIC FORUM.** Do not seek private conversations here, via Private Message or any other method. And do not seek to draw attention or clicks to an outside site of any type (unless you have received prior moderator approval, such as for academic research projects). Every comment here must be a clear attempt to engage with an ongoing public discussion in the forum. Violations of this rule will result in permanent bans without notice.\n\n**8) RESTRICTED CONTENT** \nThis sub is generally only for seeking advice, education, or discussion about sex and sexuality. We restrict or forbid many types of content here.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n**EXAMPLES OF CONTENT RESTRICTED IN /R/SEX:**\n\n**1) PROMOTIONAL POSTS.**   \nThis means any post containing any kind of promotional element, especially one which seeks to lure traffic to another site or promote a product. Links to specific product descriptions are permitted if they\u2019re PRECISELY on-topic in the context of the post, AND the post itself is clearly seeking advice in good faith.  If you're trying to sell something, conduct market research, etc - these posts will get you banned.  Linking to sex-positive blogs or podcasts is allowed, provided you make an effort to start a conversation here about the topic and use the link as supporting material.\n\n**2) LINK POSTS.**   \nLinked material must be sex positive and precisely on-topic to stay up here, and needs to be introduced with a workable framework for discussion. Please see the posted [Link Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/linkpolicy) **BEFORE** you post links!  Bare links to youtube, images, blogs, podcasts, etc are prohibited.\n\n**3) ACHIEVEMENT POSTS.**   \nThese include appreciation, humblebrags, \u201cI just had to share,\u201d \u201cI just want to say,\u201d etc. These belong in the Daily Sexual Achievement Thread, not in the main forum. Posts which are JUST sex stories belong somewhere else entirely \u2014 like r/sexstories or a similar forum.  \n\n**4) LOW EFFORT MATERIAL.**    \n\u201cDoes anyone else...?\u201d, \u201cIs [X] normal/weird?\u201d, \u201cIs [y] wrong/bad/okay?\u201d, and so forth.  Human sexuality is incredibly varied; yes, someone else likes what you like, and labels like \"normal\" or \"weird\" are meaningless - and in a sex positive community, we do not allow any moral judgments against sex acts or behaviors that are consensual.  Title-only posts, posts with no effort at an actual conversation will be removed and may get you banned.  Comments that consist of nothing but memes, \"this\", \"lol\" and such are highly disfavored.  If comments do not further the discussion, they may be removed; a pattern of these may result in your ban.\n   \n**5) SEEKING FAP MATERIAL.**   \nDo not ask for sex stories, do not ask for the hottest/strangest/most unusual/etc encounter someone ever had.  Do not ask for lists of other people's kinks.  \n\n**6) PORNOGRAPHY, EROTICA, OR PERSONALS.**    \nYou may not post or link pornography or erotica here.  You may not share pictures of your genitals here - even if you are seeking medical advice (if you need to post a picture, you need to be going to a doctor).  You may not recruit sex partners here, look for dirty chat, ask for someone to private message you, etc.\n\n**7) DISRESPECTFUL CONTENT.**   \nPersonal attacks, insults, name calling, or disrespect of any sort are not allowed here.  Sexism, racism, or any type of hate speech will result in your immediate ban.  This is a community for **ALL GENDERS** - refusing to acknowledge a trans individual's gender flies in the face of this, and will result in your ban.  \n\n**8) OPINION SEEKING, POLLS, VALUE JUDGEMENTS, OR VALIDATION POSTS.**    \nThis forum is not for simply collecting opinions - \"do you think [X] is hot?\", \"Women, do you like [Y]?\", \"What is your favorite sex position?\" and so forth.  This is not a forum to discuss your penis size, breast size, labia size, ask about other body image issues, or ask for feedback on your photos.  See the /r/sex FAQ for help regarding body image issues.  Do not post your pictures and ask people to rate or critique you.  Do not ask if given consensual sexual interests are good/bad/okay/wrong, etc.\n\n**9) ACADEMIC SURVEYS.**   \nThese require prior moderator approval. Moderators will review the question formats and will review the documentation of institutional ethical oversight (please provide). Non-academic surveys are seldom allowed.  Please contact the moderators BEFORE you post a survey or study.  \n\n**10) GENERAL RANTS, ESSAYS, EDITORIALS, VENTS, CONFESSIONS, PSAS, AND AMAS.**    \nThese don\u2019t belong in the main forum unless you have obtained prior moderator approval. Save them for story-based forums. Or Tumblr.\n\n**11) FREQUENT/FAMILIAR TOPICS.**   \nThese are addressed in either the FAQ, past posts, or both.  In case you are confused, this means that we **do not do penis size posts here.**  \n\n**12) VAGUE TITLE/TOPIC.**   \nIf a moderator can\u2019t identify your issue or the type of advice you\u2019re seeking, your post will be subject to removal.  Titles should be at least several words long and adequately express what your post is about.\n\n**13) NONCONSENSUAL OR ILLEGAL CONTENT.**   \n/r/sex is for the discussion of consensual sex among adults.  We do not permit posts that advocate pedophilia, bestiality, rape, or incest here under any circumstances, nor do we allow these topics at all in most instances.  Note that BDSM and CNC (consensual nonconsent) are perfectly valid topics in /r/sex.\n\n**14) OTHER OFF TOPIC ISSUES.**    \nThis is not the place to discuss politics or religion, to seek dating advice, to ask for how to pick up women, to rant about how you have never had sex.  Posts that appear to be dedicated to stirring up arguments - particularly about hot button topics like circumcision, the evils of pornography and/or masturbation, and other toxic subjects - will be removed and will result in swift bans.\n\n**15) IMPORTANT NOTE ON DISCUSSIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.**  \nSexual assault is an important and emotional topic which can be discussed (constructively) in r/sex. But posts which simply seek opinions about whether a given scenario counts as sexual assault do not do well here. This is true for several reasons, including the fact that assault laws vary by jurisdiction, and we don't encourage debates about jurisdiction issues here. Therefore, we ask that you refrain from describing a scenario and then simply asking \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d Instead, ask for specific advice: About how to respond to the scenario, how to avoid it, or how to proceed with next steps. **Posts which simply ask \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d are subject to removal without notice.**\n\n**16) POST LENGTH.**   \nFor ease of reading and reviewing, please get to the point of your post quickly \u2014 in the post title, first paragraph, etc. Consider adding a tl;dr to long posts.  Posts which are inconveniently long \u2014 over 600 words, approximately \u2014 are subject to automatic removal. Also, line and paragraph breaks are VERY HELPFUL for readers and reviewers \u2014 walls of text that lack these are subject to removal for readability.\n\nFurther information about the /r/sex rules and policies can be reviewed on the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules).\n\n***\n\n**Other Relevant Sub-Reddits:**\n\n\u2022 [BDSM Community](/r/BDSMcommunity)\n\n\u2022 [DeadBedrooms](/r/DeadBedrooms)\n\n\u2022 [Dirty Pen Pals](/r/dirtypenpals)\n\n\u2022 [Gone Wild](/r/gonewild)\n\n\u2022 [Ladyboners Gone Wild](/r/ladybonersgw)\n\n\u2022 [LGBT Sex](/r/lgbtsex)\n\n\u2022 [LGBT](http://reddit.com/r/lgbt)\n\n\u2022 [Normal Nudes](http://www.reddit.com/r/normalnudes)\n\n\u2022 [One Y Chromosome](/r/OneY)\n\n\u2022 [Polyamory](/r/polyamory)\n\n\u2022 [Redditor for Redditor (Personals)](/r/r4r)\n\n\u2022 [Relationships](/r/relationships)\n\n\u2022 [Sex Stories](/r/gonewildstories)\n\n\u2022 [Sex Toys](/r/SexToys)\n\n\u2022 [Swingers](/r/swingers)\n\n\u2022 [Transgender](/r/transgender)\n\n\u2022 [Two X Chromosomes](/r/TwoXChromosomes)",

He was larger than I expected, larger than I've seen IRL before,  and some positions were a little tricky for it. If I tensed up at all he either couldn't move or was pushed out. Just looking for tips and tricks to make it more fluid for both of us I guess! I think the most successful position for both of us was a modified spoons style."

        "content": "Hey everyone. Gonna get right into it. I\u2019m 26 M and I eat my own cum, I can\u2019t explain why tbh lol it\u2019s easy for me to clean up and ig there is something erotic about it, i\u2019m still horny after i nut too. \n\nI\u2019ve done this since I started jerking off basically. I dated my ex for about 5 years and i would always lick it off her when i was done. once she started birth control i was able to cum inside her and from there i ate it out of her after sex. \n\nFast forward, i\u2019ve been single and dating for about two years and have been on a couple dates and when those led to something I would wear a condom and cum in it but resisted the urge to eat it.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to this girl for a few weeks and we went on a few dates but yesterday my roommates out of town so I invited her over and we had sex. she was on BC so she let me cum inside her. after that i went down on her and started eating her and my cum out of her pussy. I was so turned on since I haven\u2019t been able to do that for almost two years. \n\nShe enjoyed the eating out session but was grossed out that I did it after i came in her and saw me actively licking it. Today texted me today and asked if i was gay and told me it was disgusting. \n\nGoing forward, is this something I should warn girls about? It\u2019s almost instinct for me to clean it up and taste it. \n\nEdit: I want to clarify about the condom part. The way I wrote sounds that I REALLY craved my condom jizz but when I was writing it I was trying to convey that cumming in the condom turned me off of from eating it that way. There really was no urge to eat cum if it\u2019s not on or in the girl i\u2019m with. if my cum ever shot on the bed i wasn\u2019t going out of my way to lick the sheets lol ",

            "\"I would wear a condom and cum in it but resisted the urge to eat it.\" bro what \ud83d\ude2d some shit Light Yagami would say",
            "Not gonna lie, I think the act of eating it is unappealing. BUT I would never make someone feel gross by projecting my own feelings about it. I wouldn't need a warning per se, but at least a \"can I eat you out?\" before actually doing it. \n\nAnd for me, there's ways I can get around the gross feeling. For one, I would just look at it as you want to lick me so bad you don't care your cum is there and that's hot.\n\nIt's super fucked up she said those things and there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need to give some big warning, but maybe just ask first.",
            "I don't really understand if you're seeking realistic advice or not. this is a sex positive sub and let's be honest the majority of the response is here are going to be based on fantasy. \n\nIt doesn't really matter how we feel something is a double standard and dealing with reality. The reality is that when dealing with women in real life not the individuals you find on this sub. Meeting a guy who would do this is probably going to shock them. \n\nAnd it's not because it's objectively bad it's just abnormal. So unless you want to elicit a response like the one you got communication would be key.",

            "NGL I would be weirded out if you came in a condom then slurped it out the condom as even as a woman that\u2019s not some shit I\u2019d do. The condom would make it taste gross. But tasting yourself isn\u2019t disgusting. She has some clear sexual biases and even some homophobic tendencies. Not A person you\u2019d want to sleep with again regardless. Even if it was unappealing to her, insinuating you are gay because of it is crossing a line. \n\nI think you might run into more women like this as a lot of them exist. If it\u2019s something you really enjoy then I would definitely give them a heads up. You don\u2019t have to be blunt and say you enjoy eating your own cum but could just tell them you love eating wet pussy after you\u2019ve filled it with cum. Sounds sexier and also reinforces pleasure for her.",
            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gay but I also would grossed out by it.  Everyone is different in their preferences. \n\nYeah, I think this is a little outside of the usual expected vanilla sex that happens with no discussion. I think this should be discussed before it happens. It\u2019s okay if you like doing it. It\u2019s okay if someone else doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s probably best that both of you are aware of how each other feels before it happens.",

I think this is great, and I don\u2019t really understand why it would ever bother anyone, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be very common. So it may be best to discuss it prior to sex.",

            "I do it too and my girlfriend loves it. None of her ex-BF ever did it - they were grossed out, but it was always her fantasy. Now I do it, lick her out, then kiss with her. Sometimes she sits on my face and smears the cum all over my face, I penetrate her with my tongue to lick her inside and get everything. Then she kisses me and licks my face. I love the mixture of my cum with her pussy juices. I can feel the taste of both. :)\n\nSo, don't worry. She's just not the right type of girl for you. :)",

            "Well, I guess that\u2019s a reminder that it\u2019s important to feel people out before showing off a little kink. Especially one that involves baby batter. If anything make the narrative about your lover. \u201cLook what you made me do. Fuck it makes me want to bust in you again.\u201d Ya know? Something to keep their head in the game, so to speak. \ud83d\ude0f I mean what you actually think about it, your reasons are your business. Not every detail needs to be shared. Nobody cares that you quality check your own oysters. Lol sorry she was a lame. I hope you find your silver platter princess soon. \u2728",

            "Tbh that\u2019s fucking hot \ud83e\udd23 just gotta find girls that think it\u2019s sexy. My fianc\u00e9 will sometimes lick my \ud83d\udc31 once he\u2019s finished inside and it excites me to go all over again!",

While I wasn\u2019t bothered by it, I can see how some women would be skeeved out by it especially if they didn\u2019t get a warning. I think it\u2019s important to discuss kinks and turn ons ahead of sex so boundaries can be set, or decisions to walk away can be made before things get awkward or weird. So to answer your question, yeah you should probably take the time to have a discussion with future partners as a common courtesy at least.",
            "I personally think it's hot and useful when a guy cleans up after himself with his mouth (except for the condom one, I think that's kinda weird), especially since I can't do it with my sensory issues and sensitive gag reflex. I suppose you could bring it up to a new girl and maybe break up with this one? That's just what I would do though. Keep living your truth and someone out there will appreciate and love every part of you for who you are.",

            "She shouldn\u2019t have said that, but I would be grossed out if you wanted to do it every single time. Like the compulsion aspect would make it pretty obvious to me that it\u2019s not about you thinking you\u2019re doing it to pleasure me. Especially when you\u2019re doing it when you\u2019re alone. And the fact that you had to resist the urge to eat it out of a condom is very strange. Condoms smell disgusting, and nothing needed to be cleaned up at that point.",
            "As a woman I eat my own cum.  I lick it off my fingers, I like putting a dick in my mouth after it\u2019s been in me, I kiss the lips and mouth that have been eating me out\u2026. \nGuys find that hot.  What\u2019s the difference when a guy does it.  Nothing! It\u2019s hot.  You\u2019re ok with yourself, you own it, you like it, do it if it turns you on.  Maybe the fact that she thinks it gross reveals her own inhibitions??",

            "2 things- since you said she enjoyed the eating out, that means she really did or at least faked that she did. Either way it\u2019s very immature and selfish to then the next day make you feel as if the whole thing absolutely grossed her out and make you feel insecure about it. Idk about yall, but if something that was repulsive to me was happening during sex, I would t be able to just fake that I was cool with it, let alone enjoy it. \nSecondly, It\u2019s actually not \u201chighly unusual\u201d but in the realm of \u201cnormal sexual behavior\u201d is definitely a more taboo activity. (And yes, there is a deference between the two). I\u2019d save that activity for more established relationships, where you have a better idea of what she\u2019s about/ in to or feel until you comfortable potentially being told she wouldn\u2019t be into it without feeling like a freak.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you should warn girls about per se, but if it\u2019s something you really fetishize and want to do every time, it might be worth bringing up casually when discussing your various kinks.",

            "For her to assume you are gay bc you did this is pretty ignorant and immature. I say move on. I think she should be happy you went down on her after sex since usually men finish before women and this seems like a good solution to that. But it boils down to you two not being sexually compatible. If she\u2019s not into it and it makes her uncomfortable, it is what it is. If you enjoy it, and it\u2019s not hurting anyone, you should find a partner who is also into it.",

            "I really don\u2019t like the way she said that to you\u2026 in no way does that make you gay. Usually guys I\u2019ve been with have been disgusted by their own cum and won\u2019t even kiss me after a bj even if I\u2019ve brushed my teeth. I lick myself basically by sucking a dick or fingers after it\u2019s been inside me so I personally see nothing wrong with this. I guess you should bring it up in the future like how I bring up the little things\u2014 I like being choked, called a good girl, etc. but I don\u2019t want you to feel ashamed for it because it\u2019s not wrong in any way. I\u2019m sorry she did that to you- I know how it feels to be shamed for your sexual preferences and it\u2019s not very nice.",
            "Wow. I agree with the consensus that eating at a girl after having cum in her is HOT af firstly. Also I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird and as someone else mentioned, girls will go down a guy after he\u2019s fucked her and no one bats an eye at that so I don\u2019t see why the reverse is any different. \n\nShe sounds immature and lowkey homophobic and I would date someone else if it were me as that\u2019s likely only the tip of the iceberg with her.",

Those are probably the same dudes who would finger a girl then insist on shoving those fingers in her mouth like it\u2019s supposed to be degrading. They\u2019re the ones who need to get over it, not you. Nothing wrong with tasting yourself.

I know, easier said than done and some things you won\u2019t find out about until you have sex. It\u2019s inevitable.

            "Woman here. \nPersonally big fan of eating my own cum and also a big fan of guys eating their own cum out of me. Also a big fan of people who do autofellatio or different positions to eat their own cum. So to me what you've described is very hot and I wouldn't have been grossed out, I would have called you hot asf. \n\nBUT most people, especially guys, aren't into eating or even tasting their own cum. \n\nI don't know if you've heard the saying \"a real cook isn't afraid of their own serving\" but there's so many people, on this sub as well- commenting under posts of girls complaining about how their boyfriend won't kiss them after them having given them a blowjob.\n\nI think it's more of a societal norm and disgust of tasting something your own body created. I mean (most people at least) wouldn't eat their own shit or drink their own piss. Some people won't even hold the wound in their mouth after having cut their finger- because it's disgusting to ''eat/taste\" your own blood. Nobody licks their sweat from their own armpits. It's all fluids that our body creates that go out of body and in most cases we let them go out. \n\nI think a big part is also the fact, that it's different areas. As in if you swallow your own spit, that's okay. It's normal. Spit is in your mouth and your mouth is on your face. If a tear runs down your face and you lick your lips afterwards and taste the tears- that isn't disgusting. It happens. So taking cum- which is created in a different area- to a whole different area of your own body ( To your face- your mouth specifically) is you doing the action purposefully. Which then if course, isnt normal or natural. But its weird. \n\nI think really, you have to decide for yourself if you want to stop doing it, continue doing it or warn people about it. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't warn people about it, because some people will defenitly back off the moment they hear something like this but maybe in the action they'll like it. Or maybe before you go down on the woman, you can warn them. Some might decline, some might say \"fuck go  for it\". It will be a new experience for some, probably most though.",

(when in some culture, men find oral sex so degrading, they won\u2019t have their wife do it as they respect her too much, and believe it\u2019s only something sex workers or gay men do) so you know, that type of attitude ranges all over. and i guess this was just such a tender and mutually respectful and loving way of viewing performing oral sex. \n\nthis was a guy i was seeing for a couple months in college, and im very happily married and sexually satisfied, and indeed have shared this story with my husband! but yea i do still think about this moment sometimes, not even in an arousing way like as masturbation fantasies or something, but more in fascination way. like i just thought it was a really pure and powerful and natural expression of sexual intimacy. \n\nlol if you read this far thanks for reading! i smoked a j and kinda rambled a little (lot?) there",

The squirming started and I assumed it was a good thing so I kept going, he kept squirming, moaned & groaned.... next thing I know he's rather aggressively pushing me off and he was squirting pee all over his steering wheel and dashboard \ud83e\udd23 I learned something that night and I still play that dangerous game from time to time.",
            "I hate to admit it but she\u2019s right.  It sometimes takes you to a higher level",
            "And we dobsquirm, big-time",
            "As a giver of BJs, this usually what I do. Just a few seconds to show my appreciation for letting me enjoy his member, but when I feel I\u2019m about to get the \u201cOooookkk\u201d and pull back I ease off. I mainly read body language, but communication is best. \n\nOP, if you want to try to be covert and sexy about it, maybe mention it in a sexting convo. Then after ask, \u201cwould you really like it if I did ___?\u201d For easy confirmation.",
            "Haha this gave me the mental image of my hubby when I keep going, we refer to it as a turtle on it's back(legs flailing everywhere in all directions), it's great and I aim for it! I know he'll stop me if it's too much for him to take.",
            "I wish that stopping the stimulation or interrupting/distracting from the orgasm right when it starts were this obvious thing people wouldn\u2019t do but it\u2019s not.\n\nCouple years ago I was with a woman who would put her face by my dick and stick her tongue out and right when I started ejaculating would stop jerking and put her hand over the head so it wouldn\u2019t shoot everywhere.  Like I have zero problem with someone not wanting to do any particular thing in bed and I didnt ask her to do anything - she just escalated the porno vibe then just sprung that surprise sudden de-escalation of the energy/display of eagerness at the beginning of my orgasm. I just can\u2019t imagine why she would do that - like she didn\u2019t understand how orgasm works.",
            "I actually prefer her to stop when I start to cum and just let me unload in her mouth. It's always been better for me that way.",

            ">Sometimes, deepthroat while I cum down the throat. \n\n>Other times take just the head and suckle it while I cum in the mouth. \n\nYeah, I'm the one who didn't make sense...",
            "Just give til it hurts.",
            "What is it about swallowing that is particularly desirable?",
            "Imo it\u2019s better as a surprise\u2026 it\u2019s already impressive enough she\u2019s making her boyfriend cum from head\u2026 if my woman was doing that, I\u2019d be grateful, but if one day out of the blue I came from head and she randomly starts swallowing and keeps sucking\u2026 I\u2019m going to the closest jewelry store and proposing \ud83e\udd23",
            "That's a keeper for sure.\nYour wife should wear that like a badge of accomplishment.",
            "So she didn't go for the soul, she went out for blood.",

            "My husband agrees so usually I\u2019ll suck a moment or 2 longer and if he signals that it\u2019s too sensitive I stop. Sometimes he will even push my head down and keep it in a position he likes.",
            "Haha it\u2019s the best it\u2019s funny as hell to see them squirm like that and I never new they could pee might have to try harder next time \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I love when they have to pull you off and it makes the suctiony popping noise lol",

            "Your question doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n\nBut, in an effort to answer\u2026 when the guy gets close to cumming, the one giving the BJ deepthroats them, so that when they cum they are fully \u201csheathed\u201d and cumming directly in their throat. No further stimulation from the penis owner is needed, as they are in the middle of the climax, and the feel of the throat itself adds anything extra they might need.",
            "My answer is in the context of what OP can do while her BG bf cums. Those things are all things I\u2019d like to see my partner do while I cum. \n\nIf you ignore the context of OPs question, sure, it doesn\u2019t make sense. When taken in context though, it makes sense.",
            "Not sure. Maybe it\u2019s the completion of the orgasm without a change of rhythm. Hard to explain.",
            "It\u2019s better to communicate even if surprise is more sexy",
            "She can have it; I don\u2019t use it a lot these days \ud83d\ude0c",
            "That's because she does. I swear I've seen my soul leave sometimes when my wife finishes me off. Just like in the movies, it just drifts away.",
            "Idk if it happened cause he was young and new to the sex game like me or if he had to pee beforehand or what. Ive tried it with 3 of the dudes I've been with since then and it only happened again with one of them. It's my 2nd favorite surprise.",
            "Im afraid I'm not following your metaphors.",
            "To be honest, what I\u2019d LIKE to enjoy\u2026 just wish my partner would do all that, lol.",

            "The situation varies imo\u2026 if it needs to be communicated then yes\u2026 but I can promise you the guy nutting off head isn\u2019t complaining\u2026 so when she surprises him with the swallow and keep sucking\u2026 he might buy a ring \ud83e\udd23",
            "Let her go for it, but the joke is on her. I sold mine for pennies on the dollar yeeeears ago!",

            "I had a weird experience after being at a urologist and they lidocained my urethra and I was so confused as I was not told the end of the sentence but realized as the pressure built into my kegal and realized that I was on a peepad. Fast forward to a week later and I was gooning in the bathroom and I had replaced the bath water twice . I had to get off as my alarm went off for work so I had not realized how long it was since I peed and I had full pressure on both gates!!!! I had no choice but to take the lead and I started to climax and I started to gush my chest with full force and I felt the piss and I had been thinking that it was going to get backed up but I was going for the best 2 minute orgasm as I was in porno pump mode and I was struck by another stronger orgasm every time\u2026. I was unknowingly going to get struck with the same luck as my GF and I had been an hour into our love making and I felt that I had told her about it before but we were not in bathroom and the couch was somehow falling apart as we were trying to get the liberator functioning and I explained that I was somehow going through a fantasy and that I wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer as I had a bit of a hard time knowing that I was about to ruin my orgasm if we halted for a piss break\u2026\u2026 I am so happy to do it but she was not as pleasured by it.",
