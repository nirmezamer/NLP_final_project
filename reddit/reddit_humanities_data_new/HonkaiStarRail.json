I got to like 900 AV or something I think against Argenti and only got 6100 points. I'm thinking gearing and using Gallagher over FuXuan here in case he can help with the breaks. Acheron doesn't feel great in this fight as you ult and kill all the summons, and by the next time Acheron ult is up the summons are back you deal barely any break damage to Argenti so the fight takes ages.",

            "Guys, how are you all building your chars regarding the stats?\n\nI was always just building my characters as I feel it and didn't even think about stats so deep before (I clear all game modes on max stars so that isn't even an issue for me), but I just thought how you should build your character properly. So my question is: when you want to achieve 160 spd on a character (or any other stat whatsoever), do you aim for the value while seeing your character stats in characters menu, or do you try to reach that value when summed with other buffs during the battle?\n\nE.g. I have a character who is 151 spd, but with Ruan Mei he is 160, so I achieve that spd value. Should I really get that 160 spd\u00a0*without Ruan Mei*\u00a0as a plain stat, or is the char ready to rock right now with RM spd buff etc.?\n\nBecause if I build my char at 160 spd, with RM they become even more speedy with roughly 170 spd. Is it implied that you always build your char \"as is\", and then enjoy your extra spd from RM, or do you rely on that buff from other supports to get that 160 spd in battle?",

Ideally you want Sparkle since she is SP positive even with using Skill every turn, but Bronya also works with some creative play.\n\nBut tbh to me, focusing on the more recent teams like Firefly may be better if you haven't already since new contents seem to catter to them. However not to say building DHIL is a bad idea.",

One of the next couple bosses is quite a bit more difficult and a lot of people get hung up on it. That one is going to be much easier with Gallagher, March and 2 dps characters.  Overall Gallagher and Lynx are the top 4\\* sustains and should be highest priority if you don't have limited sustains or Gepard.",

It seems for a long term strategy if you're looking to 100% these modes, it might be worth building an ice team anyhow, centered around March 7, Ruan Mei, and either Jingliu or Misha, as some of the most extreme challenges are a lot easier with the remembrance features.",

            "I didn't say that it's an exact metric, but that it's more likely.",

            "No. don't suggest talia for RM. do you know why RM runs vonvacq? for the 5% ERR allowing you to 3T ult, also more BE isn't needed on RM in break teams",

Harmony MC to increase her break effects, Gallagher because he does fire damage and allows her to heal when she attacks (which she does often) and Asta because she also does fire damage and buffs speed to let Firefly attack more often.\n\nUID: 619048916",

            "My best team that helped me clear MOC 12 on full auto is composed of Firefly, Harmony TB, Gallagher, and Ruan Mei. I believe it's the best team composition because the AI can understand the synergy, which helped me clear MOC 12 on full auto. It's crucial to note that if the AI can build synergy, it means the team is well-suited for the task. Realistically, the other three characters enable quicker break effects, and Gallagher provides almost 100% uptime on the heal-on-hit effect, which was originally Luocha's specialty.\n\n  \nUID: 800964046",
            "A nonconventional team for people missing Ruan Mei (and who already went for mono quantum set ups) would be:\nFirefly, Harmony Trailblazer, Silver Wolf, and Fu Xuan.\n\nTrailblazer currently is a must have with Firefly boosting her damage by a ton via super break while boosting the break effect of the whole team. \n\nSilver Wolf for her debuffs/defense shred, pretty decent break efficiency, but more importantly a weakness implant of imaginary for HMC or Quantum for herself and Fu Xuan. This alleviates some cases where firefly is the only one that can do break damage depending on enemy variety.\n\nLastly Fu Xuan to keep everyone alive and having a debuff immunity buffer while keeping the variety of elements low for Silver Wolf's implant. Alternatively Gallagher will work just as well sacrificing sustainability for damage and sp generation as he's already fire element.\n\nHopefully this aids the Silver Wolf havers or those whom want to play something else besides the traditional FF, HMC, Ruan Mei, and Gallagher team!\n\nID: 101633822",

Gallagher can sustain (while also improving break effect for Firefly) while Robin and Trailblazer provide a helping hand for the team, enabling further damage and super break.\n\n I also think this team is suitable for having a party! Robin brings the music and sings, Trailblazer dances, Firefly is the cheerleader and watcher from the audience and Gallagher brings the snacks. This team is suitable for gameplay and lore as well n.n\n\nID: 19602446",

Herta's FUA is there for clean up just in case enemies survive. HMC bc HMC and firefly are inseparable (also extra BE).

Her ult also reduce toughness regardless of weakness type, so it help Firefly and Trailblazer access to super break. currently mine is at E0, so gonna save for rerun later.\n\nTrailblazer: Enable super break.  \n\nFirefly: Preferably E2 (at least E1). fire weakness implant considered as debuff. so, Firefly can generate up to 6 stacks for Acheron in one Ult with E2. E1 will also let Acheron use skill every turn.\n\nNihility Unit: Preferably matching enemy weakness to break faster. Maybe upcoming Fire Nihility can do the job since enemy will have Fire Weakness almost all the time. Can use Welt if enemies have Imaginary Weakness\n\nUser ID: 64134053",

However, I also have Dr. Ratio who likes debuffs and does a lot of damage with follow-ups, letting him synergize well with Gallagher\n\nFinally, I'd really like to get Guinaifen (very cute, very important) because of her explosive damage and Firekiss debuff, which also allows her to synergize with Firefly's weakness break.\n\n-Ideally- this should be a really fun, fast, offense oriented team that can act as a solid team 2 to my current Clara team and maybe finally allow me to do stuff like Pure Fiction :D\n\nUID is 603394050",

It helps that I got his E2 yesterday so he can clear debuffs too. Oh, and Ruan Mei is just doing research on TB and Firefly throughout all this, of course.\n\nThe team is actually okay SP wise thankfully.

Some have noted the irony of the strong synergy between Firefly and RM due to the swarm connection so it'll be interesting to see if the two have any interaction in future storylines...\n\nAnd the dark horse...\n\nSUSHANG! On this particular stage I used her and her chicken slinging ult to soften up break bars so Firefly could nail the super break damage. Naturally she is not the only character that can do this but the skill+ult+skill combo boosted by Ruan Mei's skill shreds toughness on single targets.

            "I used Harmony MC, Firefly, Ruan Mei, and Himeko. \n\nThough the team lacks sustain, it is quite fun to see all those high break numbers while the enemies are weak and broken most of the time. Additionally, each of them still synergizes well with the other. To begin, Harmony MC and Ruan Mei will primarily serve as breaking support, delay actions, as well as buffers for dmg wise and reducing toughness bar. This, in turn, allows Firefly to trigger super breaks at ease in multiple turns, combined with her LC if you happened to own one, you could potentially kill big enemies before they even got a turn or two. Meanwhile, Himeko will provide some good extra dmg from her aoe skill, ult and especially the follow attack since you will get super break dmg as long as Harmony MC's ult is active and enemies are weakness broken, which can be easily achieved and maintained. With all this aside, however, I'm aware that you may often end up having some skill points issue with this team comps, but in depending on the case, this can be offset with Firefly's E1 and certain lightcones such as Bronya 5\\* LC or even as far as Ruan Mei signature LC. Overall, you could use the team as a way to challenge yourself and see how far it could get you (have fun!), if not, it would be ideal to use this team in a simulated/divergent universe and the likes to compensate for other certain factors like survivability and lack of healing/skill points. \n\nMy ID is 604953074",

For me it felt out of the blue and rather just slapped in the face with it.
