If you want to talk about the issues surrounding Trump, the warrant, 4th and 5th amendment issues, the work of law enforcement, the difference between the New York case and the fed case, his attorneys and their own liability, etc. you are more than welcome to discuss and learn from each other. You don't have to get everything exactly right but be open to learning new things. \n\nYou are not welcome to show up here and \"tell it like it is\" because it's your \"truth\" or whatever. You have to at least try and discuss the cases here and how they integrate with the justice system. Coming in here stubborn, belligerent, and wrong about the law will get you banned.

In the AP article, it mentions that certain people have been listed as \u201ctargets\u201d and/or \u201csubjects\u201d of the investigation. Though, it does not mention whether or not Trump has been identified as someone who is either a target or a subject. Trump has not been public on Truth Social about receiving such a notice either. Is it safe to say that he will not face any sort of legal exposure for this? I remember seeing that Guiliani had been notified of his criminal exposure months ago it seems. \n\n**If not, why, and does this mean that he - in the end - will not have any criminal liability from this or any 1/6 actions/inactions?**\n\n**My other question would be, IF Trump is in fact a \u201ctarget\u201d instead of a \u201csubject\u201d, would we even know if he was the target? From my understanding, the target doesn\u2019t get informed that they are the target, rather only subjects for large conspiracy cases.**",

            "Becoming an expert on anything doesn't just take reading a lot about it. You need to practice it in a way where it's applied - whether that be in scientific models, the courtroom, or elsewhere. Part of what makes an expert an expert is that they've had enough life experience to thoroughly vet and test their knowledge. Additionally, if you rely on your expertise for a living, you're less likely to throw it away by giving lackadaisical or bad faith takes(although this still happens, including in law).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with not being an expert and still being interested in something or actively a part of it - I do a lot of volunteer work relating to climate change, and a climate scientist would still absolutely smoke me in conversations.\n\nHowever, where it does go wrong is when people aren't an expert and don't consider that there's limits to their knowledge. The internet has created a lot of self-appointed experts because they've read a few hundred tweets or watched a few YouTube videos on something, and it makes having discussions difficult because you have these types going \"well, I've read a lot about this from my favorite influencers or tweet aggregators who disagree with you, so you must not be the expert.\"\n\nIt makes finding communities where discussions online that don't inevitably have people wanting to establish themselves as the authority on a subject without expertise difficult. If you aren't an expert and can't even back up what you say with sources or something, anything concrete to point as an example, there's no reason to be speaking as if we're anything but equals.\n\nThat's especially my beef with folks swooping in with obvious misinformation off Twitter, TikTok, etc., etc. - every hot button topic has a new conspiracy surrounding it within days, and it makes getting to the actual conversation that needs to happen rooted in the facts next to impossible.",

            "Now after a long spell in Mexico , Andy got that irresistable urge, many folks get, for home, and getting up to your old ways. The business in Maine long since concluded \"exhonorated in abstentia\" they said....that eager young prosecutor having now moved to New York from his tour through Bangor and Boston and now found himself living just blocks from old Andy down right by the subway with a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge one way and the United Nations the other, not but a few steps from his basement appartment. Long since having settled into private practice as a forensic accountant Andy had found himself in the ironic position of his firm working for Brooklyn and Manhattan DA. \n\nLong since retired, but he got the call , and figured one last job....one last good deed, to set the scales right as it were. He often thought of the patience he'd learned in Shawshank those many years ago, he thought of Linda and all the mistakes he'd made leading up to that terrible night; he sometimes though he could forgive her, and perhaps he had....but his mind wandered back to this impossible problem.....glancing at the stack of Manilla folders, 1/2discarded receipts stretching back decades, and over at the org chart that he'd pinned in his office, just 6 people in the \"inner\" circle, Don, his sons' their lawyers....the sea of lawyers, fair to say there wasn't a year gone by they hadn't \"spend\" anything less than a million dollars on lawyers, sometimes that much on a single firm or consult..... \"follow the money Andy....follow the money.....\" the technicians were kind enough to put everything into an Excel chart, Russian funding, Chinese funding, \"Other\" funding, Saudi funding .... for a country with a law specifically intended to prevent as much, old Don had quite a lot of \"funding\".\n\nThis  gnawed at him, that same way, old Bogs had, not the violence of course....the impunity....the surety the Sisters operated with, rape, beatings, murder over and over...for years....dozens of other inmates.....and it wasn't anything less than the Warden himself, that put an end to it....for his own reasons ... of course. \n\nSo Andy put the finishing touches on his findings, the forensic accounting that tied it all up, the dozens of Excel sheets that made it clear to anyone with a 200 IQ what they'd been up to, from bait and switch to high crimes of treason , there was even evidence of selling those missing documents from that property down in Florida.\n\nAnd the other thing that kept knawing at him.....they wouldn't do anything....the prosecutors , all the lawyers....it was just too much damned work, it wouldn't be the first time he'd spoken with one of Don's old lawyers or accountants and the \"strategy\" that seemed to fit the facts was that everyone just kept hoping \"someone else\" would do that lifting....but there it was filed and ready to go.....of course the question still haunted Andy, the Elwood Blatch problem.....of course they wouldn't kill Andy, he'd used a particular alias for this whole job, unless someone went looking for Alexi Dumazi of Brighton Beach, it's unlikely anyone would follow that up. Russians were always good for keeping secrets....even from other Russians....and of course they aren't about to actually help their patsy get off. More than one \"associate\" was clear that if Don ever actually needed help , none would ever be forthcoming....the money was already spent, Don's time of \"usefulness\" long past. No , in fact Andy was counting on the post-it on top of the Russian workup \"\u0413\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0443\u0440 \u0434\u043e\u044f\u0442\" something about milkinig chickens and don't believe what work you've been told....do it yourself was what Andy took away from his adventures in Russian accounting.\n\nBut he was so very tired.......perhaps this time.....the job had gotten the best of him.....worn down to the nub....perhaps like that old little axe, Andy glanced across the room to that small little nubbed rock hammer.",

I also think Jamie Raskin specifically intends to force republicans to vote on a very plan text bill that they believe those who have committed insurrection against the united states should be allowed to hold office.   But it won't work because they'll just kill the bill in committee with a voice vote.   He'll never get them on the record.   Still he can take his swing and have a few minutes in committee hearings asking why we are listening to yet more testimony about stoves when you wouldn't even support this bill going to the floor.   Why are we pretending you care about this country.   He'll get some sound clips and the people on MS NBC will compliment how he \"gave it\" to the republicans.   Don't get me wrong, I think Raskin is one of the better ones, just not in a good position to actually do anything effective at the moment.\n\nThere are no rules or norms any more.  I would put trigger rules into place making it a ethics code violation with immediate impeachment and removal from any further judgement until the senate has cleared or confirmed for a justice to overturn this bill in part or in whole as unconstitutional.   Gloves are off.   Take them out.\n\nEDIT: Heck, If I had the votes for it.  I would craft legislation which stated specifically that the court erred in their opinion and created a miscarriage of justice failing to follow established rules of law by accepting a case without a live controversy for 343 design and that the decision reached their is void and the court is ordered to vacate their decision and instate that of the lower court.

If Mr. Trump really hopes to drain the swamp, says Mr. Hamburger, cutting these agencies back to constitutional size would be a terrific start.\n\n> Mrs. DeVos, for example, has spent her life promoting school choice, and her husband founded a charter school. It is difficult to imagine an Education Department under Secretary DeVos ever sending out a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to bully universities into expanding the definition of sexual harassment and then encouraging them to handle allegations in a way that has turned many campus tribunals into Star Chambers. Not to mention making a federal case about bathrooms. \n\n> \u201cOddly enough, the danger is that Mr. Trump will not think big enough,\u201d says Mr. Hamburger. \u201cTo paraphrase him, the impact of changing the way Washington issues rules would be YUGE\u2014and it would make him a historic and transformative president.\u201d\n\n> Federalist:\n\n> The violation of the former president\u2019s freedom illuminates the damage done to the many thousands of other Americans who have been subjected to unconstitutionally issued search warrants.\n\nTrump\u2019s freedom wasn\u2019t violated by a warrant because it was signed by a magistrate, or for any other reason.

And actually doing anything about it at this point would crush the court's integrity with the public. And that's the only thing Roberts seems to care about which is why they bothered investigating in the first place.\n\nSimplest answer is probably the correct one. Alito did it to protect his majority because he's a pugnacious idiot that decided to play politics. And it fits him like a glove.",
            "Appointing someone with no subpoena power to run the investigation is a good way to pretend to be doing something about the norm-breaking, while simultaneously making sure that there won't be legal consequences for the norm-breaker.  If Roberts sincerely thought someone stole the draft, he could have referred the matter to law enforcement.  Not doing so is tacitly acknowledging that the leaker could not be charged with theft, ie it's one of the justices.  Since the draft was 3 months old and came out 1 week after a WSJ article quoting a leaker that Roberts was trying to convince Kavanaugh to decide narrowly (ie rule for Mississippi without overturning Roe completely), cui bono implies that one of the other 4 conservative justices (Alito and Thomas being the most likely by far) leaked to put it into public that Kavanaugh signed onto the original opinion, therefore marking him for conservative rage if he flipped and joined Roberts.

Then again, it is *The Federalist*, which does a supreme disservice to its namesake publication.\n\nHamburger routinely refers to magistrate judges pejoratively as \"non judges,\" but Article III judges as \"real judges.\" He cites [28 USC \u00a7 636](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/636), which enumerates the powers of a magistrate judge, for the proposition that \"district courts can assign the non-judges 'such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.' \" This statement ignores the other *enumerated* powers expressly granted to a magistrate judge by Congress, such as \"all powers and duties conferred or imposed upon United States commissioners by law or by the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts.\" \n\nAnd let's talk a walk over to Fed R. Crim. P. 41(b):\n\n>(b) Venue for a Warrant Application. At the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government:  \n>  \n>(1) a magistrate judge with authority in the district\u2014or if none is reasonably available, a judge of a state court of record in the district\u2014has authority to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property located within the district\n\nSo that pretty much torpedoes his legality argument. Both Congress and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure agree that magistrate judges can issue search warrants.\n\nThis part\u2014\n\n>He therefore is not a judge of the court, but merely one of its servants. \n\nIs also demonstrably false under Rule 1(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which is helpfully titled \"Definitions\":\n\n>(3) \u201cFederal judge\u201d means:  \n>  \n>(A) a justice or judge of the United States as these terms are defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7451;  \n>  \n>(B) a magistrate judge; and  \n>  \n>(C) a judge confirmed by the United States Senate and empowered by statute in any commonwealth, territory, or possession to perform a function to which a particular rule relates.\n\nThe rest of his disingenuous op-ed is not a legal argument, but an attempt at a persuasive one; i.e., magistrate judges *shouldn't* be able to issue search warrants.

But for that reason I\u2019m not sure the Federal Magistrate Judges Act or the Rules of Criminal Procedure really address his argument. I think Hamburger would just say the statute or rule is unconstitutional to the extent it confers Article III judicial power on Article I judges. \n\nThat said, I think Hamburger sort of glosses over the history of magistrates, and I am not convinced the signing of a warrant is a uniquely judicial power. I think there is a good argument that the Founders real concern was just having the warrant approved by a neutral party separate from the Executive\u2014not necessarily a \u201cjudge.\u201d\n\nThe petty offense exceptions are a good example where Hamburger runs into trouble. He is fine relying on history until history shows that English and American courts allowed non-judges to hear petty offenses (and thus, why the Supreme Court has held that magistrate judges may also hear petty offenses and some misdemeanors). He says the Constitution changed this by preserving judicial power in \u201call criminal cases.\u201d  But the Founders did not consider petty offenses to be \u201ccriminal cases\u201d in the first place (unlike more serious felonies).",
            "My favorite part is: \u201cThe U.S. Constitution vests the judicial power of the United States in the Supreme Court and such other courts as Congress authorizes. That is, it leaves no room for the judicial power of the United States to be exercised by any other court or any judges except those who sit on such courts. This bodes ill for federal search warrants signed by magistrate judges and other judicial officers who are not judges of the courts.\u201d\n\nCompletely ignoring that magistrate judges are in fact \u201csuch other courts as congress authorizes\u201d",

In most districts, magistrate judges handle pretrial motions and hearings in civil and criminal cases. While most civil cases are tried by district judges, magistrate judges may also preside over civil trials if all parties consent.\n\n> Like other federal judges, all full-time magistrate judges are paid the same salary, regardless of where they serve or their years of service.\n\n> The position and authority of magistrate judges was established in 1968. By federal law, magistrate judges must meet specified eligibility criteria, including at least five years as a member in good standing of a state or territory\u2019s highest court bar. They must also be vetted by a merit selection panel that consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from the community.

            "I'm not going to read through the entire motion, but I'll call out the misstatement of law in the first sentence of paragraph 3 at page 2, just to illustrate how desperate this motion is. \n\nHere, Bannon writes:\n\n>Accordingly, Mr. Bannon \u201cshall\u201d be released if his case \u201craises a substantial question of law or fact,\u201d that, *if accepted*, would result in reversal, a shorter sentence, or a new trial. Id. (emphasis is Bannon's).\n\nWhat 18 USC 3143(b)(1)(B) actually says is:\n\n> unless the judicial officer finds\u2014 ... that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in\u2014 (i)reversal, (ii)an order for a new trial, (iii) a sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment, or (iv) a reduced sentence to a term of imprisonment less than the total of the time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal process.\n\nBannon hangs everything on that \"if accepted\" phrase because his legal argument is entirely without merit, meaning that it is extraordinarily unlikely to result in reversal, an order for a new trial, etc.  Under the Bannon formula, *any* argument would be grounds for a stay pending SCOTUS review because if the standard is *any* argument, *if accepted*, dictates the stay, literally any argument will work to gain the stay (e.g., the argument that says that any sentence of imprisonment greater than 1 month constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment *is* frivolous, but *if it were accepted*...it would not be frivolous).  In other words, the Bannon position would require the Court to completely ignore what is actually written in 18 USC 3143(b)(1)(B).  He goes on to set this up as some sort of circuit split between the Ninth Circuit and the DC Circuit, but the split is actually over the threshold that the putative question of law must reach before it is sufficient to possibly satisfy (b)(1)(B)(i).

I'd tried so many times over the previous 17 years to quit, but always went back. \n\nThankfully, even a minor stroke was enough to scare the shit out of me and give all that up. While I don't miss cigarettes anymore -- so fucking nice not to have to be saddled with the costs, both financially and physically, of smoking anymore -- I *do* still miss alcohol. I'd already been cutting back since I turned 30 once I could *feel* how much worse my body reacted to it than it did in my 20s, but after the stroke, it just wasn't worth the risk. \n\nI got incredibly fucking lucky that the stroke barely affected me in the long term; I can still walk, talk, and think clearly while there have been people younger and better shape than me who'd been left permanently disabled by worse strokes. So pulling the plug on alcohol seemed like a better trade-off.

            "Most of the information in these filings was already known, although it has been memory-holed to some extent because the investigation fizzled out after the Egyptian bank stonewalled for long enough that the DOJ just gave up on the investigation.\n\nOne new and potentially momentous piece of information jumped out at me though. On p. 20 (PDF numbering), the court wrote,\n\n> [Redacted Egyptian bank] argues that complying with the subpoena would require violating Country A's Banking Law, Country A's Anti-Money Laundering Law (\"AML Law\"), and unspecified law in Country B.\n\nLater in the PDF on p. 48, in a separate memo, the court specifies in a footnote that, \"Country B is the People's Republic of China.\"\n\nWhat possible reason would an Egyptian bank need to worry about breaking Chinese law by providing information to a US prosecutor about a $10m transfer from their bank (in Egypt) to Donald Trump (in the US)? I cannot think of a single reason that does not involve some or all of the funds originating in China.\n\nSupposedly Ron Rosenstein told Mueller not to dig too deeply into Trump's finances, so this appears to be the only real probe of Trump's finances as they relate to foreign election interference. What he so poisonously refers to as \"the Russia hoax.\" The Egyptian bank's stonewalling made it impossible for Mueller to proceed with the case as Special Counsel because the rest of the investigation had concluded and it wasn't clear whether the Egypt investigation would go anywhere. So he closed up shop and submitted his report to Barr, handing the rest of the Egypt investigation off to a team at DOJ, which promptly did absolutely nothing about the investigation until it was quietly dropped during the height of the pandemic when the public was distracted, to say the least.\n\nSo this probe never went anywhere, and we should all be very concerned about that. If there was ever going to be a smoking gun demonstrating Trump's corruption, it was always going to be financial. Following the money was always the best strategy and Rosenstein knew precisely what he was doing when told Mueller not to pursue that angle. He was crippling the Mueller probe from the get-go. It is incredibly concerning that a case like this was just summarily dropped, despite a large volume of evidence suggesting a Chinese-domiciled entity or person transferred the enormous sum of $10m to Trump so he could fund his campaign for the last few weeks of the 2016 election season. Given how close that election was, that amount of money could very well have been decisive, and thus it's entirely possible the CCP put Trump in the White House. Making him literally the Manchurian Candidate.\n\nEdit: [Here's a more reputable source than me that summarizes the broad strokes of this strange Mueller subplot.](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/trump-campaign-donation-investigation/index.html)",
