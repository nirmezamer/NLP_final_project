            "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe are in the unique & exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. We\u2019re not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money we\u2019ll get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. \n\nSome give-away ideas we are tossing around:\n\n-\tOne month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.\n-\tA copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era\n-\tA game designed to help you and your partner grow closer \n-\tDonating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. \n\n\nAgain, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.\n\nI wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered."

        "content": "I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.\n\n---\n\nYou know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all \"A+++ would ride again.\" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.\n\nYou can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for \"break up with them\" and \"get rid of them\" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:\n\n1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. \n\n2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. \n\nThe majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened\u2014your account\u2014with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. \n\nThe number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:\n\n* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.\n\n* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because \"once a cheater, always a cheater.\" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**\n\n* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**\n\n* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**\n\n* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**\n\nYou can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.\n\nBasically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.\n\n---\n\n##TL;DR: \n\nThe vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.\n\n(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare.

            "Also there seems to be an overreliance on arbitrary \"rules\" like \"age gap bad\" (obviously some age gaps really are bad but five years in your 20s shouldn't be such a big deal IMO) or \"high school sweethearts bad.\" It's true that sometimes certain things like that can cause problems, but if the post isn't asking about something that is very obviously related to one of these \"rules,\" there shouldn't be so much focus on stuff like \"you're dating your high school sweetheart, that's Bad, break up.\"",
            "I'd just tag on that posters pay attention to all advice posted, regardless of the upvotes/downvotes. The hivemind here can be brutal. \n\nThis is PARTICULARLY problematic when advice gets legal advice adjacent. Sometimes the right thing to do and the smart thing to do, don't line up. This sub will upvote the moral choice, every time (alright, I guess this is a little hyperbolic). Don't treat any of the advice you read here as wise/informed. Read it with a critical eye: the repercussions of acting on our advice will be yours to deal with. Read our advice as relationship advice ONLY: there's good reason why we aren't allowed to give advice on legal matters.\n\nTake the advice as if it's coming from your salty, newly single bff that considered using ivermectin for non-FDA approved reasons. We aren't experts and most of us have been burned.",
            "Kind of solid advise. When you ask strangers for advise who dont know you they can only advise based on what info you give and its very hard for them, for us, not to connect those sittuations to similar of our own.

            "**100% this!**\n\nHalf the posters here also are just looking for support on how to \"be right\". Think of the kind of person who comes to a website to get ammunition to bring into the relationship. You can see the poster going to their Partner, \"See, reddit agrees with me! You are abusing me and toxic. We are incompatible and I am perfect. So F off. Wait, you are mad and hate that I went to reddit to win an argument using bullshit logic? But they say I will be better off alone. I am so lonely. I am going to go to reddit and get revenge.\"\n\nYou can smell the villain arc in so many posts. If the post isn't asking for advice about their own behavior, assume they are using anything you say as a way to fight their partner.",
            "noticed that too",
            "Absolutely. I see so many comments  that say things like \"call the police\" about things that aren't illegal, like - as much as you might WANT some things to be illegal doesn't mean they actually are.

        "content": "It\u2019s gonna be a long one\u2026\u2026.\n\nTLDR: Yesterday I thought I was accompanying my husband to his neurologist appointment. On the way down he told me that not only did he have a one time affair with a man, he contracted HIV from this person and found out the week prior from blood work from a unrelated medical procedure.  We were in fact not on the way to the neurology, we were actually on our way to the HIV clinic.\n\n\nI (38F) have been married to husband (51M) for 16 years, together for 20. He had 2 children when we met that I adopted later. We have one biological child together. We have had a solid 20 years, in love, good partners, good parents, good sex, we of course argue, but it\u2019s always been respectful and never crossed any boundaries, just overall a great marriage. Of course I wouldn\u2019t be on here if that was the end of it\u2026\n\nHusband has MS. He was diagnosed in 2021, but lesions were first found in 2012. He has a \u201cpresumptive\u201d diagnosis because his lumbar punctures have always been \u201cnormal\u201d. The last year, he seemed to be progressing really quick. His doctor also started transitioning to retirement so we moved to a new doctor within the same practice. He had a routine MRI earlier this year and the doctor called to tell us results and it was weird? She mentioned a lot of non-ms \u201cissues\u201d and ended up saying she wanted another LP and more labs. LP was mid May. \n\nDuring the last year, but really about 7 months, I noticed my husband started acting different. He was hiding his phone in weird ways (like had a procedure and refused to let me hold his phone?), was kinda holding it to the side so I couldn\u2019t see his screen, just overall I felt like something was off. He did go on Prozac at this time and told me he was anxious about results, etc. To try to be a good supportive partner I chalked it up to anxiety, stress, depression. We discussed his phone and that I thought he was hiding something from me and he said he was not, reassured me, I moved on. He\u2019s also always been kinda weird about doctor\u2019s appointment and me going with him. It\u2019s always bothered me bc I want to be supportive and as he has progressed, I\u2019m moving in to a caretaker role and it\u2019s not even that I want to be there, but I have to know what\u2019s going on with him to be able to care for him. \n\nEarlier this week, he told me his neurology appt was Friday, doctor wanted to talk to him in person. I\u2019ve been spiraling. I was sure this was not going to be good news. He said at one point he didn\u2019t want to me to go. He even said he needed to stop by the office after work so he\u2019d just let me know what the doctor said. All week I assured him that I loved him and that he wasn\u2019t a burden, no matter the results. I felt like he was opening up, he agreed to start therapy. He then agreed to let me go with him to doctor appt.\n\nYesterday, we are at the hospital area, neurology is to the right, other hospital parts to the left. I try to turn in to the parking garage and he told me to keep going. He then is asking if I really love him, do I mean what I say about always being with him, etc. he then said that he had got some results back about 8 days ago. And that the results were going to affect me also. He said his blood results showed he was HIV+ and that he made a huge mistake 6 years ago and had a one time sexual encounter with a male. (Side note: we are both bi-sexual. We are very open to new sexual experiences, but it\u2019s him and I only. We don\u2019t swap or have other partners. I\u2019ve always felt very safe with him.)\n\nHe was not bringing me to his neurologist, we were at an HIV clinic. Obviously, finding out my husband cheated, had HIV, I likely have HIV all in about 20 mins was  a really bad way for him to come clean.\n\nThanks for sticking along, but there\u2019s more. \n\nI had an HIV test done, obviously assuming I was positive. But I was not. I\u2019m negative. How?  If he had an affair 6 years ago, that\u2019s the only person and only time, we had a decent sex life (unprotected sex twice a week?) from the time of the affair up until ~January. Late 2023/early 2024 his depression kicked in (I thought) and he has not had an interest in sex. Really he\u2019s had no interest in me. We\u2019ve had sex twice since December. I admit, I\u2019m not well versed on HIV. I learned a lot yesterday. I know that is harder to contract HIV in PiV, but 5 years of PiV and I\u2019m still negative? I\u2019m going to my gyn next week for std testing and a check up. I will be asking lots of question. \n\nI feel like a fool. I\u2019m hurt and very angry. This is still so raw. I gave him chances yesterday to come clean with ALL of it. Any omissions or lies I find out about today or later is immediate divorce and he\u2019s aware of this. I just feel like it\u2019s not adding up. My heart hurts, I want to continue building the life we have, grow old together. But I don\u2019t know if I can move forward and actually forgive him. The betrayal is killing me. I feel dumb for even considering staying. We will start couples therapy next week, I\u2019ll continue my regular therapy, he\u2019s agreed to see a therapist. But none of that matters if I can\u2019t trust him.",

            "It was absolutely not a one time affair. In fact I\u2019m willing to bet everything I have (not much but still) he wouldn\u2019t even have told you about the HIV if he didn\u2019t have MS. He was very happy betraying you and leaving you in the dark, infecting you with who knows what. He\u2019s just doing this because he needs a nurse and that\u2019s NOT YOU. You\u2019ve given enough of your life to this man? You were 18 when you got together and he was 31? This is not a good man. You have A LOT of life left to live is this how you want to spend it?",

He is already disabled and his condition will get worse, so if you stay, you will sacrifice the rest of your life to a cheating asshole. There's only one choice - don't cover for him, leave and be open about the reasoning - he cheated and contracted the worst std possible. It's your chance to have a normal life, don't waste it before you are too deep in the caretaker's role.",

            "The cheating might have been forgivable, plenty of couples work through that. But he put your life at risk, repeatedly, for years. That is atrocious, and may even have been a criminal act, depending on where you live. You cannot seriously be considering couples therapy with this person!

A similar scenario happened to a family member, but this was back in the 90s and I was just a kid so I didn\u2019t really understand everything that was going on. However, I knew my uncle had an affair with a woman who was either hiv+ or already had aids and my aunt found out somehow. They divorced immediately and she got full custody of my cousin. He died, very quickly. Yet my aunt leaving was the best decision she made. She protected her health, her future and her child. She\u2019s been with a kind, silly, full of life man for over 20 years now and has never been happier. \n\nYour husband is a predator and a disgusting person. He groomed an 18 year old child when he was a 31 year old man who already had two kids. You became a bangmaid and babysitter practically overnight. He stole your youth and has had you being his caretaker in some way or another your ENTIRE adult life. Ffs, run as fast as you can. This was not from a ons six years ago, as another Redditor said, hiv has a six month incubation period and you noticed he got weird around last year or a bit earlier. He doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you or his kids because he could\u2019ve exposed them too with his unbelievable selfishness. If you choose to stay, choose to continue to waste the next 20+ years of your life, then you alone will have to suffer those consequences. What he did, exposing you, is criminal and vile and not something one does to the person they supposedly love. Divorce and take what you can from him. The fact that you\u2019re considering any other option goes to show his grooming has had the results he wanted. Get therapy please.",
            "The fact that he got so squirrelly about his phone 6 months ago means that there was probably an affair that started around that time.\n\nAlso him being 31 when you started dating at 18, that\u2019s almost grooming. He saw a young girl that he could take advantage of. Why did he and his ex split? Did he cheat on her too?\n\nHim not having anyone left isn\u2019t your fault or your problem.

HIV is a life changer however.

Set a user flair to participate there. For more general recovery advice see r/supportforbetrayed.  \n\nYour insistence on complete transparency is spot on.  You need to know what you are dealing with here. In the reconciliation sub there is a saying that reconciliation cannot begin until the last lie has been told.  The only reason I might trust him on the 6 years ago issue is that there\u2019s no reason to place his cheating so far in the past.  It doesn\u2019t make him look any better than if it were 6 months ago.  Then again you were seeing secret-keeping behavior over the last few months too.  \n\nTo help him understand how important the truth is, read him this (with appropriate modifications):  https://www.survivinginfidelity.com/documents/library/articles/discovery/joseph-letter/\n\nA final thought:  as the wayward he will have to take the lead in rebuilding trust, helping you heal, and in general repairing the damage. Reconciling takes years.  Can he put you first for years considering his care needs?

It happens, but is no guarantee for the future.\n\nNot to say that he definitively didn't cheat more, just saying it's possible.",
            "I know I'll get crucified for this but when I see a 31-year-old with kids start dating an 18-year-old and then married her...... Sorry, I suspect he has no idea where he got it because he can't narrow it down.",

Find out the truth yourself which is in that phone.  Also find yourself a lawyer because he endangered your life and get a consult.  You\u2019re going to have time get tested again in 6 months because he may have gotten this disease within the year.  Again look for the truth and then press him again.",
            "I just want to kindly point out, OP, that the very first questions he asked you were questions around if you love him enough to stay. He did not care about your health at all. Think about that and know that the right thing would be to leave this selfish man. Also, it definitely wasn\u2019t one time 6 years ago. Deep down, you know this. Leave before you contract HIV too.",

He didn't tell you about his positive status because he cares about your health and wants you to get tested. No. He told you because his symptoms are probably getting worse and he expects that you will be taking care of him if or when his condition starts to deteriorate. You will have to give him his medications, take him to appointments, hear certain information, medical terms, etc. Eventually, you were going to find out anyways so he decided to tell you.",
            "Don\u2019t feel dumb about wanting to try  and work it out. Don\u2019t let anyone shame you. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of people on here making assumptions about people they don\u2019t know (that\u2019s reddit right?). It may have been a 1 tome affair 6 years ago, it might not have been. Try and filter that nonsense out. \n\nFrom what I have read, is that you shouldn\u2019t make any decisions in regard to staying or leaving for at least 6 months. You just had a bomb dropped on you. The idea that you could make a sane decision now, is not likely. \n\nIt\u2019s time to look at some hard truths. Look at the reality, not the ideas, not the potential, not the fantasies. \n\n1- can you trust yourself again? Everything you thought you knew just went through a spin cycle and you don\u2019t know what is true and what isn\u2019t. The life you thought you had wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s less about trusting him again and more about trusting you. \n\n2- what are his actions? Do his words and actions match? Looking at the present day, do you want to continue life like that? Often, we fantasize about the what if\u2019s and miss what is going on in the now. Hope holds us back for seeing things for what they are. \n\n3- was the marriage as good as you thought it was? I don\u2019t know about you, but I know, I tend to repress the bad parts. I will make myself forget about all the bad. If you were content, clearly, he was not. Did you miss the signs he was giving you (and by the name NOT blaming you for what he did). \n\nWhen you put all of those things together and can look at things objectively, you can make decisions. Yes, I understand the gravity of the disease he put you at risk for. I am not minimizing that. Anyone who engages in that behavior puts their SO at risk- whether it be disease, a crazy unhinged other betrayed spouse, etc. Only you can decide what you can handle, what you want out of life, and what\u2019s best for you. I\u2019m rooting for you whichever way you go.",

My God the lack of respect.\n\nI also think theres a good chance he only told you because his doc insisted, or he was pretending to the doctor that you knew and the doc somehow called his bluff. Knowingly having sex with someone when you are HIV positive is sexual assault.\n\nI think there's more truth still to come out. I think his behavior is self serving. I think he doesn't deserve your caretaking as he declines.\n\nI dont know how you could ever trust him again after this. You are still young. Dont waste your entire life caretaking this selfish man.",
            "You believe it was a one-time encounter and he just got unlucky? Really?",
            "I'm so sorry you are going through this. No one has a one time affair, if he did once and got away with it, he certainly did it more times. The fact that he puts your health at risk is absolutely unacceptable. Divorce him, dump him to the curb. He only considered his wishes when he did it and now that everything comes to this he wants to drag you into it!! For what? So you can take care of him? Come on!!!\n\nYou are still young, you still have a lot to live. You deserve to be respected and loved.",

            "I wonder if it was easier for him to contract HIV because of MS compromising his immune system? If you find out let us know!",
            "It is understandable to leave him after this. \n\nRegardless of the number of times, he's cheated at least once and didn't take precautions for his health or yours. HIV isn't the death sentence it once was, but it is still a serious condition that takes work to manage. His cavalier attitude towards everyone's health is almost bigger than the cheating to me.",
            "So you didn\u2019t contract hiv? You\u2019re lucky. I\u2019d be so happy about that that nothing else would matter",
            "100% agree he\u2019s a disgusting disloyal selfish asshole.\n\nBut I want to clarify, responsible people living with HIV can have health and fulfilling sexual relationship without passing along HIV. U=U means undetectable equals untransmittable. Furthermore, PrEP also prevents infection in those who don\u2019t have HIV",
            "I think I\u2019m struggling connecting the part that this happened 6 years ago and that the entire time I\u2019ve been exposed. I feel like the fact that I\u2019m negative is a glaring signal that I\u2019ve escaped it and should just move on.",

Imagine if you had to advise your best friend: her husband contracted HIV, and still continued to sleep with her, knowing full-well that their partner might contract an incurable illness? You\u2019d tell her to bolt, and bolt quickly. Right?",
            "Totally appreciate the advice! I am definitely not thinking clearly right now\u2026.so excuse the next part of this, because well maybe it just that I do need to leave. I think part of it is that he doesn\u2019t have family to rely on. We have children together and I don\u2019t want to just leave him with no one. Is it that he cheated? Or how he told me he has HIV? Or that he was careless enough to contract it and then not get checked after the affair?",
            "Just to be clear\u2026.he didn\u2019t know that he had hiv until last week. \n\nDoesn\u2019t excuse the fact that he should\u2019ve been worried about it for 6 years and he should\u2019ve been checked after the affair.",
            "Yep. OP think about dating a teenager yourself at 31. What\u2019s your initial gut reaction to that idea. You\u2019re not that far removed from 31 yourself.",
            "What do you mean? I was there, so it was his first visit. I intend to talk to my gynecologist next week about the timeline. It seems like hiv can go with no symptoms for 10 years.  He has regular blood work and there hadn\u2019t been anything until early this year when his white blood cell counts were higher than normal.",
            "Thank you. I learned a lot about HIV yesterday. I know it\u2019s absolutely possible that he did contract 6 years ago and that I may just have been incredibly lucky. But I don\u2019t want that to cloud my judgement either, because the truth is he did cheat, he did it irresponsibly and this is the result.",
            "I agree. It was manipulative. I had given him lots of chances to come clean about his test results for weeks. I thought that was what he was hiding. That his MS has severely progressed and he was scared to tell me that.",

            "If you believe it\u2019s been six years then you are in denial. He is trickle truthing you. It doesn\u2019t matter that you threatened immediate divorce if other stuff comes out. The math isn\u2019t mathing. He\u2019s already proven to be a liar. He is lying through his teeth because he needs a caretaker. Why would you spend the rest of your life taking care of someone who betrayed you like this and put your health at risk like this? Being a caretaker to a loved one is hard. I know that first hand. And that is when the relationship hasn\u2019t suffered from lies and betrayal. Don\u2019t let him guilt you into staying. It isn\u2019t fair for him to use his MS as a weapon against you to stay.",

            "It\u2019s a giant glaring signal that he betrayed you and gave no shits about endangering you. He is a person who can lie to you , to your face, every day for 6 years.

Someone that can so casually lie and betray is not going to think \u201c oh, forgiveness, thank you, I will spend the rest of my life trying to be a better person and show my joy and gratitude\u201d. He only told you because he could no longer lie. There was no moral epiphany. Lawyer up- the person you thought you were married to does not exist, that future was NEVER an option, this cheating POS who didn\u2019t even care enough to wrap it when cheating is the real guy.",

Think of it as if he did give it to you because it is not peaches and cream\u2026 my step grandfather is a hot mess, he\u2019s undetectable because of medicine but his life is miserable, his insides fall out frequently & had he not broken his back in February he would\u2019ve likely just drank himself to death",

            "If I\u2019m doing the math right you were 18 and he was 31 when you first got together. You were barely legal and he was a grown man with children. Sounds to be me the inappropriate behaviour started back then when he groomed you. Then he cheats, has unprotected sex exposing himself and later you for years. The cheating was a betrayal. But the fact that he didn\u2019t care about your health, never got tested for STDs. And the way he was manipulating the situation right until the end not telling you about his diagnosis where you were actually going and why and then he has the audacity you use your declaration of love to guilt trip you. The betrayal is next level, you\u2019re still young don\u2019t get stuck with this cheating lying POS and end up being his caregiver, he doesn\u2019t deserve your forgiveness ,love or loyalty",

            "How about the fact he cheated and also didn\u2019t use protection when he cheated then continued to have unprotected sex with you putting your health at risk?\n\nIt was (apparently) six years ago. He could have gotten himself tested in the months after it happened but has continued to put you at risk for all that time.\n\nNow he\u2019s trying to GUILT you into staying with him.",

            "It definitely wasn\u2019t a one time mistake 6 years ago \u2026 Wonder how many other people he has spread HIV to.",
            "you wouldn't be negative if he had HIV for six years and you've been having unprotected sex for those six years, you'd absolutely have caught it by now. you weren't taking prep i assume, no prevention, no way it wouldn't have spread once in the hundreds of times you guys have had sex since.",
            "It is possible for you to be negative, even during the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis people who contracted it didn\u2019t always give it to their partners, it can be dormant for a longggggg time. \n\nThe part that doesn\u2019t add up to me is that he only found out about it recently. If he hasn\u2019t been interested in sex with you since December then maybe he found out then. But why did he randomly get an HIV test? What prompted him to get an STD test? If I were you I\u2019d demand access to all of his medical records and STD testing. But really this is unconscionable, he betrayed you.",
            "Yes I believe he may be lying about it being 6 years ago\u2026you can also get hiv from kissing if his gums bleed for example not just sex. The chance of you not getting it in any way and having unprotected sex with him is so small. I really think he\u2019s being dishonest about this.",
            "Do not wait! Leave. The information you have now is more, far more than enough to make that choice.",
            "Doesn\u2019t matter if it was one time or a hundred, if it was 6 years ago or 6 days.  The fact is he cheated on you during your marriage.  He\u2019s lied directly or by omission every single day since.  He hid his AIDS diagnosis from you.",
            "Yup. That's also my opinion. He needs someone to take care of him.",
            "Firstly, you can never let him touch you again. The man has exposed you to HIV. Thank god women are less likely to catch it with unprotected sex. You need to realize how lucky you are and get the heck out of this bad situation",
            "Run, he is going to whine  and manipulate and play the \u201cpoor me\u201d card. You have been caring for him long enough that it feels like your responsibility, it is not. You accepted those responsibilities when he was lying to you about the terms",
            "Find more evidence. You need it. This all happened VERY RECENTLY. Dont believe nothing and dont let him touch you you are a woman now and you have to give a good example to your kids. Some things must never be forgiven.",
            "Sweetie, I don\u2019t think you need any more evidence to prove that this man does not care about you like you deserve. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\nHave there been other times where he\u2019s put his wants (I.e sex) before your basic needs (I.e monogamy/loyalty/trust)?",
            "I\u2018m sure it\u2019s hard to accept that you threw so much time away for a disgusting, lying cheat. It\u2019s horrible to see your life in pieces without any of it being your fault. But I still beg you to open your eyes and leave. He groomed you at 18, made you raise his kids and now he wants you to waste the rest of your life on being a caretaker for him despite his actions. \n\nCheating alone *may* be something people can work through, but cheating *without at least being safe* should be non-negotiable if you respect yourself.  \n\nEven if you honestly believe the story about him contracting it from a one-time thing six years ago, he knew he fucked someone else, he knew they weren\u2019t being safe, he knew he was putting your health and in fact your life at risk every single time you had unprotected sex. \n\nBut of course there\u2019s also the fact that there\u2019s no way he\u2019s telling you the truth now. If he had caught it six years ago and you\u2018ve had sex regularly up until January, the odds of you still being negative are so slim I\u2018d actually be interested in someone doing the numbers. Plus you *know* he\u2019s been hiding something from you for about a year.",
            "Not sure that\u2019s fair. Naive on purpose? I\u2019m trying to gather all the facts and make the right decision. We\u2019re talking less than 24 hours here.",
            "You need to discuss this with a physician or charity specialising in this subject, get the stats from an expert.",
            "That's not necessarily true. Do some more research.",
            "That isn't true, my father didn't contract HIV during 5 years of a relationship ; she blessed him with Hep C though. She also wasn't in treatment & shortly after their split up (max two years iirc) she died to AIDS.\n\nIf you're having regular sex with a HIV+ person over years, the chance getting it are obviously higher than during one time but there absolutely are people that get lucky & don't get infected.\n\nI also think it wasn't 6 yrs ago, due to his secrecy over the phone being rather recent but that still doesn't change that she doesn't need to be infected even after years of exposure. Especially as they don't seem to have regular sex, chances drop even lower.\n\nLet's hope she also lucks out on that one!",
            "This is not true. The chances of contracting HIV though PiV is actually fairly low, all things considered. So it is possible, but how possible is what I want to get a medical opinion about.",
            "Yeah this has been a big shock, you\u2019d do well to take some time for yourself and maybe stay with family or friends who can better support you for a little while at least.",
            "There are no facts to consider other than he is endangering your life willingly and repeatedly and without your consent. He is a disgusting worthless excuse of a person and you are accepting it if you stay.",
            "The chance of a man giving it to a woman is higher though than that of a woman giving it to a man.",
            "This man is still lying to you. You're getting caught up in details because you are trying to find an excuse to stay. Bottom line, he doesn't cars about respecting you and he doesn't care about your health. Why be with a man who didn't particularly care if you contracted HIV and subjected you to a lifetime of having to manage that illness and stigma?",

He barges in the room and goes off on me, saying he\u2019s sick of me being lazy and all I\u2019ve become is fat and unattractive. I\u2019ve been super skinny all my life and have recently put on a tummy pooch, probably from the munchies and just becoming an adult woman. I don\u2019t have my 16 year old body anymore, but he let me know he misses \u201cwho that girl was\u201d.

I\u2019m 120 pounds 5\u20196. What if I ever get pregnant or go through a medical ordeal that causes weight fluctuation?\n",

It is not feasible for us to look like teenagers for the rest of our lives. Body types, genetics, medical conditions, and other things can also play into weight gain. In general, women can more easily hang onto weight as well as naturally have rounder tummies as our bodies need those things to accommodate a pregnancy.

Do it for yourself. Start taking steps to quit smoking and begin integrating healthy physical activity, healthy foods and vitamins into your diet. \n\nAll of this being said... the fact that he feels it is ok to badge into the bedroom at 10pm while you are tired and getting ready for bed after a long workday, and berate you, that is super concerning. Even if you legitimately had a concerning weight issue, any decent partner knows that this is a topic to approach sensitively.

But he did. \n\nDo you want to go many more years worrying about another one of those? Do you want to stress about starving yourself down to his ideal, which sounds incredibly unhealthy? And as the comments said\u2026what if you got pregnant? Can he deal with the post-pregnancy body alongside all the sleepless nights as a new parent? (Or would that just be you alone parenting because he\u2019s also a child?)",
            "It\u2019s actually just above underweight. Same height as you and I let people convince me I was fat when I wasn\u2019t underweight anymore.\n\nI gained a ton of weight cuz of medication and ED cycling and wish I could have been Happy at 120 or 145.\n\nDon\u2019t let him convince yourself there\u2019s anything at all wrong with you. If he\u2019s not okay with someone changing, he shouldn\u2019t be in a long term partnership",
            "The issue isn\u2019t your weight, it\u2019s the fact that your bf decided to approach the issue by verbally attacking you, with no discussion, just insults.\n\nThat\u2019s not acceptable.",

He\u2019s probably really struggling with his addiction and withdrawal from weed. And it\u2019s brining out the ugly side of him. And, if you\u2019re still smoking weed while he\u2019s quitting then he\u2019s probably extremely jealous that you \u201cget to\u201d smoke weed, and he doesn\u2019t. \n\nEither way, I don\u2019t think this is really about you. He\u2019s angry and you\u2019re in his proximity. He\u2019s well out of order, and you should do your best to not internalize it. \n\nAnd unless he apologizes, and gets over his withdrawal and addiction issues in a timeline you can handle, then he might have done irreparable damage to the relationship. And that\u2019s something he\u2019ll have to deal with, possibly solo, when he\u2019s fully sober.",

THIN. At your height it is bordering too thin/underweight. he wants you to have the body of a child and that is truly disgusting. i sincerely would leave anyone who would have the audacity to yell at me over my weight and call me lazy after a 9 hr shift AND i work more than they do. \n\ni\u2019m 5\u20193 and 130 lbs. sometimes more, sometimes less. i\u2019m an athlete my whole life and i\u2019ve even been a fitness trainer, and never, ever was \u201cthin enough.\u201d though i\u2019m happy to say i no longer think this way or agree with the notion, i never achieved that \u201cmeth chic britney belly\u201d i was after. it just is not possible for my body to do. i always have a little pooch, no matter how clean i eat or how much i exercise. \n\ni don\u2019t have any issues dating though (honestly quite popular if i can toot my own horn lmao), because there are plenty of people in the world, fit and otherwise who understand that people grow and change and that weight fluctuates for fucking everyone.

That\u2019s not even what matters though. No one should be with a partner who makes them feel like they\u2019re not good enough based on what their body looks like at a given time. OP might decide she wants to get more fit and active, for her own reasons, but her bf seems to want her to be an eternal teenager. He\u2019s not life partner material.",

It\u2019s recognizing that something which worked before, is no longer working, and allowing you and the other person to both move forward into future good things. Relationships change and end, and recognizing that isn\u2019t giving up. \n\n\nIt\u2019s like resigning from a job which you were happy at for years but no longer feel fulfilled in. You gave it your best and had a lot of happy years, and it\u2019s not good to let bad years pile up and overpower the good just because you feel guilty for letting go!",
            "there was a lot that was wrong with the relationship, I was not perfect by any means at all, but I saw what I didn't like about myself and changed. begged my ex to change since he always said he wanted to change as well, it was all talk on his end and complaining that nothing good was in his life. I still struggle, as I loved his family and knew them like the back of my hand, but I felt like a shadow in his family and I was the bad guy when it came down to his mom or me. I'm sad it had to end, but how else could I thrive knowing I felt like an outsider with people who didn't get to know me? I'm thankful we're on good terms, it is hard knowing my ex is struggling more with this emotionally than I am, but I hope this is the change he needs to improve himself. it's not my issue to hold his hand through every little issue he deems is the end of the world anymore.",
            "It\u2019s not giving up. It is unhealthy to stay because of the sunk cost fallacy. When you\u2019re in a relationship that is toxic, that is abusive, if you are in a relationship that is making you unhappy, if you feel you have to walk on eggshells, if you\u2019re realizing there are red flags\u2014when you leave, you are choosing yourself and your happiness. That is not selfish. That is loving yourself.",
            "The moment he comes barging into the room and starts going off on me, that\u2019s the moment I start making plans. I\u2019ve been with my husband over thirty years and between the pair of us we have had some size changes during that time, that never changed the way we treated each other.",

            "No he's just taking his self hatred and hard time out on you. Honestly he may have been the right guy for you when you were 16 but now you are both very different than you were back then and it's OK to let this one go and learn more about yourself and what you need and want in a partner. You can't change him.",

        "content": "My partner and I have been intimate for about two years now. He is often very insistent that he still loves me even if the sex isn\u2019t great and he doesn\u2019t want me to feel embarrassed, but I\u2019m having a really hard time pleasing him in bed. Here are some things that he has been critical about: \n\n1. My facial expressions during sex are not flattering\u2014I have since been very mindful of my face and making sure I try to look attractive \n2. Not being vocal enough\u2014I have tried moaning more which didn\u2019t help because of point #3\u2026 \n3. I don\u2019t talk enough\u2014which I fixed by telling him how good he feels, which positions feel good, what spot to say in, when I feel like I\u2019m going to finish which didn\u2019t help because of point #4\u2026 \n4. I don\u2019t move enough. This one I really really struggle with. Like when I am in missionary I try kissing him, try putting my legs around his shoulders, try pulling him in and moving him up and down against me. When we are doggy style I literally just cannot force my body to move, some women may be able to relate but that position is just paralyzing to me but I am able to arch my back all the way! And when I am on top he doesn\u2019t like when I grind back and forth which is really the only way I finish, and doesn\u2019t like when I bounce up and down because he says it hurts. All in all he says I\u2019m not very \u201cgraceful\u201d. His ultimate criticism is that I am not \u201cworking with him enough\u201d and moving with him but I just can\u2019t figure out what that means because this brings me to point #5 \n5. I don\u2019t have rhythm he says. So when I try to rotate my hips against him or also move when we are in missionary or side lying he says that I am not moving right and ruining the flow. \n\nI truly am starting to feel bad. He says that he loves me so much and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so ashamed but I really don\u2019t hear anything positive at all except for that I am attractive. There\u2019s been many criticisms from the beginning and I barely finish myself because I\u2019m so focused on making him happy. The only thing I know that I am good at is head which he doesn\u2019t let me do anymore because he wants sex to last longer. \n\nI genuinely wish there was like a tutorial or something, we were both virgins and I truly don\u2019t have experience. I feel like I\u2019ll never live up to his expectations and really need advice. I know some comments may say to not stay with him if he makes me feel this way but that is not an option for me right now. Sex tips are so appreciated, thank you! ",

Sex when love is involved is about the intimacy between the partners. \n\nHonestly, I'd ask him where he got these conceptions and expectations about what sex should be and look like, when you're the only person he's ever had sex with.\n\nIf he says porn, then you could remind him that they are professional entertainers and ask how he'd feel if you couldn't enjoy a night out with him, because he doesn't look and dress like a GQ model",

            "As a seasoned old lady in my 30s - sounds like your fiance has a porn problem and is trying to shift the blame onto you. How would he feel if you critiqued everything he did in bed? You sure you want to marry someone like that?",

Do you tell him what you like? It sounds like he doesn\u2019t care judging by how he doesn\u2019t want you to be in your favorite position (on top) yet expects you to do all of his favorites. \n\nIt sounds like this guy wants a porn star to fulfill his fantasies. This sounds much much deeper than sex this is a red flag on his character. \n\nAlso, sex is not good when you don\u2019t feel confident and have anxiety about pleasing your partner. It\u2019s only good when both people want to be there and want to please each other.

            "1. You know what is attractive to good men? Facial expressions that indicate you are really enjoying yourself during sex. You know what is attractive to shitty men? Acting like you are starring in a porno.\n2. As for being vocal, this one really depends on the person. As a woman, when I'm trying to orgasm it helps me to be quieter, it's less distracting and I can focus on getting there. When the goal is making him cum I do usually do up the vocals a little more so that he feels good. No harm in a little performance enhancement as long as you are also able to orgams at least once during sex.\n3. This is a two way street. You have made a good effort to be vocal since he likes it, I just want to make sure he is doing the same. I often find that men will demand the woman gives a sexy performance and they they are just really quiet with maybe a few grunts. Like no sir, you need to give some moans, some dirty talk, and tell me I feel great too!\n4. Some positions can only have one person doing the majority of the movement, but it sounds like you guys don't really have a flow or rhythm worked out which is a bit odd since you've been dating for 2 years. If you constantly have mismatched thrusts that can ruin the sex. I would suggest trying more slow and sensual sex rather than trying to figure out a jackhammer beat together. This sticks out to me \"And when I am on top he doesn\u2019t like when I grind back and forth which is really the only way I finish\". Our bodies can cum multiple times in one session unlike men. Get your rocks off and then focus on fucking him in a way that feels good for him. Sex is a give and take, sometimes a positions is about getting you off and sometimes a positions is about getting him off. Cuming together is great, but sometimes both partners have be selfless and do a positions they don't like as much because they other person loves it. This applies to him as much as it does you.\n5. See point 4. Try out different speeds ways of touching him in addition to the sex. I would also look up advice on how to position your body during cowgirl. Our vaginal cavity isn't straight up, it's titled a bit backwards so you have to lean forward a little when your sitting on him to ride smoothly. It's like a diagonal up and down movement with a scooping motion from your pelvis, kind of like rolling (tuck your core in). I would also try reaching one hand behind your and touch him while you move and keeping the other on his chest for stability\n\nThere are tutorials. Avoid heavily produced porn, look for amatuer stuff, and there are TONS of guides and illustrations online.",

Anything as long as you don't enjoy it. Don't be natural and make your actual pleasure a day joy face, Don't use the motion almost every woman uses to have sex on top...\nThe way you make love is 100% absolutely perfect. This sounds like negging and unrealistic BS. He needs to accept that sex is also about You, for You, and if he wants you to make crazy porn noises and motions and be vocal he needs to make you cum instead of demand better acting. This sound so gross for him to say any of this stuff. This sounds like He wants a doll not a person. Nobody looks pretty when they have an orgasm but most of their partners think they look like a goddess. Most people look like they are in pain or on fire or something.

When you love someone, and she looks like she\u2019s having a great time, then that always looks awesome. \nUnless he changes the way he looks at sex, he will never find satisfaction anywhere. He is focused on pleasing himself rather than focusing on making love to you. If his mind was on pleasing, loving, and appreciating you, then he would find enjoyment in being with you. Instead he\u2019s using you to masturbate while tearing down your confidence.\n\nThere may still be hope. This is his first time.

At the very least, he thinks that real sex is supposed to look like porn, which means he is not invested in you, he just wants you to pretend to be a porn actress. I'm surprised that you want to put up with that.\n\nI think you need to accept that you will never please him, because he doesn't actually love you for who you are. He doesn't love the natural movement of your face, the true expression of your voice, the way your body naturally moves, the way you interact on a basic instinctual level. There is nothing wrong with you at all! This is a him problem, and you will never be able to fix every single one of his tiny complaints, because he is choosing to find fault rather than to find pleasure. Does he make you feel safe, adored, cherished, beautiful, funny, better, smarter? Does he make you happy? Does he ask you how you want to be touched in order to achieve the best orgasm? Does he explore your erogenous zones and spend time working you up into a lather until you cum over and over and over again?\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that sex with someone who truly loves you and wants to seek your pleasure is a completely different experience than this. This man is treating you very poorly, and not in a loving way. I would be shocked if any good sex could come from this level of criticism. Fundamentally, pleasure comes from release, not from tying yourself up in knots trying to have an \"attractive\" face, and faking things that you aren't feeling. \n\nYou can read the Emily Nagoski book  \"Come As You Are\" if you want to understand more about sex, but I truly don't think you can do anything to make this better as long as he thinks that the \"problem\" is you and not how he is choosing to behave in bed.",

I can tell you right now he doesn't know anymore than you and it boosts his ego to himself to make those comments to you.

He's probably watched porn most of his life and doesn't even have the experience to realize that that's not how it is in real life 99% of the time.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, he just wants something different and is attempting to make you feel like you need to provide that. You really don\u2019t owe him that. You could go find someone that talks to you about  their preferences without trying to make it feel like your fault.",
            "Sounds very suspicious. Such high unreasonable standards... Ive had a relationship where the girl didnt have any experience, bit instead of bitching I taught her and simply adapted to her own style.

            "Just want to add I had a similar issue with an ex, it felt like we could never get into a matched rhythm and he made me feel a little less than skills wise and always took the lead. After being with many people since, I realized it wasn't me it was him. He was trying to set the rhythm in every position rather than feel the rhythm and energy between the two of us. Wish my current partner we are both actively matching eachothers rhythms, and tbh if i'm on top then i'm setting the rhythm!! I'd be annoyed if i was having fun in cowgirl and my partner kept tryna throw me off my rhythm. Your man may have a similar issue with trying to set the rhythm all the time instead of feeling it from the energy between the two of you. Just my two cents.",

You definitely want to be enjoying feeling pleasure, versus worrying about what he thinks about you or what you're doing with your body AT ALL. Has he asked you what YOU want?

He sounds very demeaning and unwilling to accept that you are a person and sex/intacy isn't a show or pornographic act, but should be a comfortable, safe, intamate moment to connect with the one you love. He is not showing you love by criticizing you and making you insecure. This is not normal or healthy. Do you really want the feel this way for the rest of your marriage or your life? It's not your job to fit his fantasy mold. He seems very misguided, either because of porn, or mysogy, or both, but trust that you are very likely not the problem here. You deserve better.",

Does he criticize you in other aspects of the relationship?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Let me yell it for the peeps in the back: You don\u2019t have to stay in a bad relationship to \u201cmake it work\u201d.

The fact that you are both the only person that either of you have slept with probably has a lot to do with it as well. If the only reference point he has is porn he might think that's what sex is actually like. Idk he should be working with you as well, more concerned with your mutual pleasure/much less one sided.

He watched to much porn and expects sex to be like in porn movies ( it\u2019s not) 2. He is trying to ruin your confidence, both personal and sexual. Some men do that just, both conscious and unconsciously. Sex is about discovering yourself and each other. It\u2019s not about making \u201cgraceful\u201d faces. Fuck that guy, sounds like a bully",

If he continues to have these unrealistic expectations, then neither of you will probably ever be happy having sex with each other. And if he wants you to be a better lover, criticizing you is not the way to do it. To be honest, you both need to be in other relationships and have different experiences. Learning what you like and don't like, learning what works and doesn't, learning how to properly communicate what your needs are, and what your boundaries are is found by trial and error. Sometimes, you can experience that with a single partner. Sometimes, it takes many. But at the end of the day, you have to do what makes you happy.",

You need to just be focused on properly angling your hips/legs and enjoying it and stimulating him. I also think doggy style where you\u2019re the one twerking is a super weak movie mostly created in porn for the visual. You should again just be angling to take him in in the most stimulating way, and rubbing your clit lol",
            "Please please please forgive me for laughing! But your boyfriend is full of s***. He expects you to me expectations that he's cooked up in his head. He needs to go out on the streets and get a real freaking leave you alone. What he's asking you for it's not love it's acrobatics and his image what sex would be like from looking at too many pornos. \n\nWhen my boyfriend got out of jail after having been gone for a really really long time I was looking forward to getting him back into the swing of things. We were pretty active before he left so I was looking to be pretty active after he got out. \n\nOn our first encounter when he got out, this SOB slap me on my ass, called me a b****, and grabbed me around my neck!  I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE MY CLOTHES OFF YET! We were still in the foreplay mode.\n\nI sl\ud83d\udca9pped him back. JUMPED out of bed and told him never to call me a bytch again. And, if he ever thought he was going to choke me again I was going to k\ud83d\udca9LL him. \n\nHe looks so shocked. He looked at me and said, \"I thought that's the way you women liked it?* We didn't do that kind of shyt before he went to prison. It wasn't going to start today. I know that he got all that from all of them tall tales the boys told when they were sitting around gen pop as well as all the porno they watched in Prison. \n\nI had to let that 15 year relationship go. Not to mention, he was a lot younger than he was still stupid.  Fine as hell... But stupid.\n\nThat wasn't happening, baby! All those things that you mentioned in your description sounded just like my dude. Now mind you come I was already that way. When we got together I taught him a whole lot of things. Being vocal and active were part of it! But, not being freaky to the point of abuse. That was not part of the package.\n\nThose requests of your boyfriend reminded me of my now X.  \n\nFirst of all, you sound very inexperienced when it comes to sexual activities. Don't worry about that. You've now been educated after his experience with your freaky boyfriend.  \n\nBut the next time that you think you are in love with someone, you can use all the things that you learned with your freaky boyfriend and turn them into loving gestures hopefully having someone who responds to you in the same way. You've learned some things now. But you learned them the wrong way and you did the wrong thing by trying to acquiesce to this freaks demands. \n\nYour boyfriend is a weak, insecure, puzzie, and a  control freak that probably used to masturbate to Sears catalogs when he was a little boy.\n\nLove yourself and find someone to truly love you. Then show him how you've learned to please a man and how he can please him. \n\nThis one right here is not the one. I repeat HE IS NOT THE ONE FOR YOU. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GIVING HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS BREAK YOU DOWN AND RUIN YOU. \n\nIF YOU DO GO BACK AND YOU DO GET BROKEN DOWN AND RUINED, REMEMBER SOMEONE ON THIS SUBREDDIT WARNED YOU. \n\nDON'T YOU BE STUPID, TOO!",

I've never heard of a straight man being so utterly uninterested in sex that all he can do is criticize his partner. also, wether he's straight or gay, please stop blaming yourself. the problem lies with him, I can almost guarantee. either porn has completely jaded him sexually, to the point where nothing is exciting or good enough, or he's struggling with his sexual identity and rather than deal with it, he's passing the blame to you. most guys would be elated to have a partner who is willing to make noise, talk dirty and get whatever kind of freaky for their pleasure. there are so many red flags coming from your man, I can't list them all. do you really want to waste your youth on a man who does nothing but criticise you in response to your heartfelt effort? who blames you for his sexual dysfunction? if you move on, you'll likely find that sex is better with people who care about pleasing you as much as you care about pleasing them and this guy does not. he isn't even trying but cuts down everything you do.

Whatever the reason, by making you feel so bad about yourself he gets to be in control of the situation and makes sure you only see yourself as bad and blame yourself.\n\n\nThe moving goalposts prove it's negging rather than just impossible porn standards. If he wanted you to just act like a porn star he would be happy when you do that. But he's not. Whenever you change a thing and do what he wants he finds a new criticism. He makes you feel bad all over again.

            "Maybe I'm way off here, but this sounds like a variation of the \"but it was just a joke\" method of verbal abuse. You know the steps, they go like this: \n\n* say something really mean about the person, making sure to pick a tender subject that is guaranteed to hurt\n* when the target protests, respond with \"geez, I was just kidding, can't you take a joke?\"\n* repeat at random moments until the target is a sobbing blob of glup.\n\nIn your boyfriend's case, he is using what he thinks is \"constructive criticism\" to destroy your self confidence. The goal is most likely for him to avoid taking responsibility for his lack of enjoyment of sex. He has probably created a concept of how sex should be that is completely unrealistic, so you will never be able to meet even the minimum standards that he has established. If he can think of enough things to complain about regarding your performance, then it's all your fault. When you complain, or start crying, he comes out with the \"but I love you so much, and you shouldn't feel ashamed\" drivel.\n\nYou should probably seek out therapy, both for yourself and for the two of you as a couple. If he is genuinely trying to improve the sexual experience for himself via the constant criticism, therapy should help him see how unproductive his approach is. It should also bring his imaginary ideal of what sex should be like back down to earth, giving him more realistic goals to work toward. Finally, therapy may get boyfriend to realize that the problem is at least 50% his fault, and that if he wants to have a lasting relationship with you he better stop blaming the bad sex entirely on you.\n\nYou need to realize that what your boyfriend is doing to you is not normal. Most guys his age would be happy to have sex with a sock. For him to have these extensive lists of what you are doing wrong sounds like abuse to me. Most couples make minor adjustments in their techniques in response to their partner's requests, but these are usually infrequent and easily resolved. What your boyfriend is doing is setting out goals that are impossible for you to reach. \n\nYou may not be able to resolve this issue; it really depends on what is motivating your boyfriend to criticize you so frequently. He is going to have to make some pretty significant changes in his behavior, while you need to build your self-confidence. It's a big order, and I wish you luck. Just remember OP, what is currently going on is not acceptable behavior on your boyfriend's part. If it continues, don't be afraid to cut your losses. Life is too short to put up with what you are going through right now, and there are plenty of men out there who are kind, and who truly value their partners. You need to find one of those guys for yourself.",

It also sounds like his expectations come from porn consumption \n\nMy advice is to learn what YOU enjoy in bed. Experiment alone, solo.

Tell him you think you should split up, twist it a bit to say he shouldn't have to put up with such bad sex so he can go find someone better. See his reaction. He will probably say no, he loves you and you can keep trying to be better. But be insistent. Say you have tried your best and can do no more, you really feel you should break up.  Bet he begs you not to. Ask him why he wants to if tge sex us so bad. Be pushy. Get to the truth. And no matter what the reason, I would still be tempted to end it.

Obviously porn is not indicative of real people but it might give you some ideas.\n\nDoggy style is the easiest position to move with, you just move in a rhythmic back and forth and you can stay in control by varying the speed. You can also add a little circular movement (like hula hooping) for added satisfaction. Watch some dancing video of girls grinding and practice yourself.

            "Almost 30 and I second this for sure. Men who watch too much porn suck in bed. The authenticity just isn\u2019t there. It makes the connection part of sex almost nonexistent, which makes it much much less fun. Unrealistic expectations, too much pressure to be theatric. The way he\u2019s talking down to you, he honestly just sounds like a total dickhead. What a turn off.\n\n\nYou\u2019re both virgins and he\u2019s saying you\u2019re the problem? How would he know that? He may lie about watching porn, but everything you\u2019re describing is what an insecure man who watches too much porn is like. You guys also may be sexually incompatible, but in my experience when two people have a strong connection both parties shift to meet the other and make it a good time. Sounds like he\u2019s not doing his part to meet you. He sounds selfish and too judgmental. Which is quite a bit his problem and shows that he\u2019s hanging on to his pride and not doing is part to satisfy you and instead using you as a prop. Probably because his brain is screwed up from too much porn. \n\nThis is an extremely hard problem to tackle bc \u201cbut everyone watches porn\u201d. Which is partially true, but there are many men who understand it for what it is, use it sparingly and it doesn\u2019t change the chemistry of their brain/ the dynamic of their relationship. It\u2019s an important thing to be honest and communicate about it, but it\u2019s the easiest drug accessible and lot of men jeopardize their relationships for it out of arrogance.

It was so hurtful because I really thought things were going better but I guess not.

I became really uptight and self conscious during sex, to which he then picked up on and asked why i wasn\u2019t enjoying it. Never again. This man admitted to saying all these things because he was worried i would leave him. I will NEVER sleep with someone I can\u2019t just be myself and loose all inhibitions to be in the moment.

But I've not had a partner complain about anything I did this much or my facial expressions nor movements or sounds \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I understand I probably had more experience than you, but even with my first boyfriend who we were both virgins at the time with - didn't complain. \nNot to mention my current partner who says he's never had this good sex with anyone else before me (the feeling is mutual tbf), comfortably communicates about sex and listens in and out of the bedroom (eg: what he liked most, what he liked me saying/doing, asking me what I liked most, etc..), but we also talked about what we liked and what we were into before we started getting intimate and now we refresh on that too every now and then to make sure :) \nI think you should definitely sit down and have a serious conversation with him about how you feel and that something has to be done about it because although you don't want to break up with him, ultimately if you're not made to feel good, I don't see it lasting forever unfortunately. Good luck!",
            "Gurl, this is really awful, he is just cruel. Most men who WANT to have sex would not behave like this. \nMy take after having experienced a partner like this is that he\u2019s tearing your confidence down and setting you up for further abuse. Just because he\u2019s not violent, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not abusive. \n\nHe\u2019s setting impossible standards and then moving the goal post as you attempt to achieve his request/demand. \n\nThe hot/cold behavior is really bad for your emotional & mental health! This will break you down over time and could make you into a shell of yourself if you don\u2019t learn how to set some boundaries. \n\nIf you really think he\u2019s worth it you could go to therapy, but if he is narcissistic or covertly abusive\u2026.therapy can actually be dangerous. \n\nThis is a BIG deal. You shouldn\u2019t sell yourself short and trivialize these events and his shitty behavior. Because he is young and clearly has was zero emotional intelligence\u2026.you might be able to teach him how to be a little less abrasive and lovingly give feedback, but that\u2019s a lot of emotional labor. \n\nI do wonder along with other redditors if he watches a ton of porn and has unrealistic expectations. Have you asked him about his porn consumption? \n\nA good partner would want to satisfy you yet he\u2019s more concerned with how you look than how HE is making you feel sexually which makes him a BAD LOVER. \n\nThere are men out there who want to satisfy you and enjoy it. Sometimes chemistry doesn\u2019t match with people even though you want it to. You might have sex with another boyfriend in the future and it just flows.\n\nHe\u2019s putting everything on you and creating massive insecurities that will impact you in the future\u2026.this could have lifelong effects if you don\u2019t nip it in the bud soon.",

It is not this nerve racking performance where you need someone directing, and the main player needs to get all her cues and poses right for it to be a success. That is just bullshit, and I don\u2019t know if he actually believes the things he is telling you, or if he is purposely trying to insult and make you feel bad so you don\u2019t leave him or something. I\u2019m not sure which is worse. \n\nThe faces people make are usually considered a turn on for the other partner. It shows you\u2019re doing a good job and your partner is having a good time. Same with the vocal stuff. The grinding and instinctual movements you are doing is literally what sex is all about\u2026 finding that rhythm with your partner. Not one person deciding the rhythm, and then telling the other their rhythm is wrong. \n\nThe more I think about this, I honestly think your partner is negging you. I think he is trying to make you so self conscious and nervous about your sexuality that you won\u2019t ever possibly feel sexy enough to want to do it with someone else, ever, ever again. I think he is trying to make you feel like shit, and make himself seem like he knows everything. It\u2019s disgusting. \n\nIf I was you, I would get out now hun. You are so young. You don\u2019t need this kind of toxic manipulation in your life. Sex is supposed to be a loving act, the closest you can ever feel with your partner, and he is turning it into a horrible school lesson that you can never get right. I can\u2019t imagine how much this has already affected your confidence, and it is only going to get worse as it continues.

Instead of telling you what motions feel good to him, he just criticizes you. That's not a good communicator, that's not someone who makes good partner material. \n\nA lot of women can't move in doggy position. There are a lot of tutorials out there for how to ride on top and other sex positions, to make it feel good for both of you. \n\nI'm sorry he is being such a jerk. I will be honest though, I would not marry someone like him. We change so much as we age, you want someone who wants to learn and grow with you, not someone who criticizes you without trying to find a solution and makes it all your fault. It's not all your fault here, not even close. You aren't bad in bed, he is bad at communication. \n\nI went through some issues and sex became not possible for a bit. I'm married and this started to put a strain on us. I finally opened up about my struggles and we worked on solutions together. We kept our physical intimacy together without sex and that really helped us. \n\nNow I'm doing much better and we're having to relearn what my body likes. I'm so thankful to have a partner who I can talk to and who talks to me as well. This would not have been a good journey if he wasn't willing to communicate and work with me. If he had blamed me for the issues, that would not have been a good outcome. \n\nMy point is, is this the type of person you want to grow old with? What do you want from your partner?

Honestly, most women get off best with hands or mouths or toys, without any penis in the picture at all. And because of this, sometimes taking turns is the only way to make sure everyone gets what they need. This man was a virgin when you met. He is not a sex expert. He\u2019s not even good at sex. I know this because sex with him makes you miserable. And your enjoyment is the ONLY measure of whether or not he\u2019s any good.

His insecurities are being projected onto you, without a care of the outcome.\n\nI also fear that you are unaware of the consequences staying involved with a man who's narcissistic traits are his driving force.\n\n\nOP- start really paying attention to the dynamics outside the sexual aspects. \nDo you feel like you can be your true self without being criticized? \nAre you always thinking about his reaction or feelings on every move you make?\nCan you breathe? Do you feel more at peace when he's not around you?\n\nI am a 40yr old woman. Here to give you advice that I wish I would have had (even from strangers), because I learned blindly:\nIf you question his love, it's just not there the way you want/need it, and you will never be truly happy.\nMore likely, your future will be spent in misery. And the woman you are rn, will be a lost soul who you will have to journey to find again.\nPlease leave while you still have no children together",

            "Of course he doesn't ask about her pleasure. Her grinding on top is the only way she can cum, and he complains that he doesn't like it. I know that for guys, that position usually doesn't really do all that much for them.\n\nMost guys still wouldn't complain about it, because WHY WOULD THEY? They get to lie back and enjoy the amazing view of their lady having a good time with their dick. \n\nHe obviously doesn't give a damn about her pleasure.",
            "I agree with this. My first thoughts were not of his possible use of porn, but of his manipulation tactics.",
            "Honestly it\u2019s not reflective of how he treats me outside of sex, although we do have other issues that could be another post in itself. It just feels like every time I do what he wants there\u2019s another things wrong",

            "My partner doesn\u2019t laugh *at* orgasm per se, but he becomes like hypersensitive afterwards so if I do anything like run my hand over his chest, touch his neck or face, anything like that, he\u2019ll bust out laughing. It\u2019s kind of adorable!",

            "Yes, I suspect it\u2019s going to be very damaging. I have gone through a similar situation, and it screwed me up way more than I realized. It wasn\u2019t until I got out of it that I realized just how messed up my head got. And I was plenty experienced, too.",

You being hurt isn\u2019t a priority. It\u2019s a nuisance. \n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t tie yourself into knots for a man who isn\u2019t able to be apologetic and accountable for his own actions.",
            "Yes. That is implicit.",
            "Absolutely! It would probably be better for her to get out of there, but I know human nature and love and we tend to try everything we can first. And not knowing the rest of their relationship, it could possibly be just this one thing (though it is a pretty bad thing) and it could be worth it for her to fight through it. I know I wouldn't, though. Been there, done that myself.\n\nThat said, OP... watch out for one thing. YOU don't need to be the only one trying to change or fix it. Sex is a partnership, and it is the responsibility of both partners to \"find a rhythm together.\" If the only thing he can do is criticise you and not find ways to better himself as a partner, then he is not worthy of you. By all means, try your best to please him... but expect the same in kind.",
            "I am reading this back now and it is not brief but I don\u2019t want to leave details out so I\u2019m sorry about that!! \n\nFor example, we got engaged last March. I was really excited about it because we had the greatest relationship imaginable at the time. I was a little curious how we were going to get through it with money being so tight at the time but I was elated nonetheless and bought a wedding dress right away so we could elope later in the fall just like we talked about. \n\nThen he said no to the whole thing because his parents wanted to be there (they have been extremely abusive to him like\u2026 choking and screaming and verbally abusive to him through his life\u2014and treated me poorly all through our relationship) but chose them over our dream. It wasn\u2019t until recently that he was willing to discuss an elopement again (does not want a big wedding, didn\u2019t specify what he wanted and would get irritated whenever I\u2019d bring it up. He now led to three elopement photographer meetings getting cancelled and is now apologetic but says that I am irrational for everything not being on a perfect time frame\u2026 when I compromised everything I wanted about an engagement to accommodate him. The whole thing on top of his unresolved issues with his own depression have really led to some apathy and it is heart breaking. He doesn\u2019t view ANY of this the way I do and is extremely happy with me which makes it all the more confusing.",

Just when you think you\u2019ve heard it all (like the guy who left shit smears on a woman\u2019s sheets during a hookup, then blamed it on her nonexistent menstrual period), then another story comes along and shocks you!",

            "What\u2019s concerning is that they\u2019re engaged (and if you see OP\u2019s other comments, it sounds like her fianc\u00e9 has been a pretty big a-hole when it\u2019s come to their wedding), and she\u2019s never been with anyone else. So, she has nothing to compare the way she\u2019s being treated. Once she gets married\u2026 oof.",
            "He is happy you are letting him mistreat, own and enslave you. He is happy you are revolving around him. He is not happy WITH you, because you are not happy. He is happy making you unhappy. He is happy you are letting him get away with this. \n\nHe has childhood trauma that he is reenacting with you. He is relieving himself of his pain by displacing it into you. You are describing every abusive relationship.",
            "I'm seeing a pattern here of you working extremely hard to please him so that you can achieve mutual happiness and him making it increasingly impossible to do so while claiming he's happy. Maybe he is happy, but if he's happy while making you feel insecure and unhappy, that's its own problem.\n\nYou say you've been intimate for two years and you got engaged a little over a year ago - how long have you been together in total?",
            "He\u2019s not happy with you. He\u2019s happy *manipulating* and *using* you. There\u2019s a difference.",
            "This isn't just a sex problem. This here also shows he is putting others before you and he belittles you about this too by calling you irrational. It doesn't sound like he cares about your needs or wants at all. It sounds like your needs are only respected when they align with his and with the other people he cares about. \n\nBack to the sex thing- I agree with the other commenters that he has porn brain. He expects you to perform FOR him rather than have sex WITH him. Sex is about sharing something intimate. You are your most vulnerable in that, and with the right partner you can totally let go and just feel. \n\nI've been with my husband about as long as you've been alive. My husband actually really enjoys it when I get \"ugly\". When I make \"unattractive\" sounds and faces, he knows I'm REALLY into it and that excites him more. He also knows it's a privilege to witness me that vulnerable. And for my part- I wouldn't give someone that privilege again if they were that judgemental about my vulnerability. \n\nYou say it isn't an option to break up, but I think you should plan your exit. Find a way to make it an option. Early in your relationship is when your partner usually is the most complimentary towards you and the most self sacrificing. If he's already swung the other way before you are even married, that doesn't bode well for your relationship in the future. He's already taking you for granted and you haven't even hit that stage yet.",

There are many free versions but here is one: https://dn790007.ca.archive.org/0/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf\n\nI know I\u2019m a stranger on the internet but I implore you to read it. It is just amazing reading and powerful. It should be required reading for every young lady before she starts dating. \n\nI don\u2019t know your situation but I do know that is  knowledge is power, it\u2019s not just some saying lol If it doesn\u2019t help you see what is going on \u2026 it\u2019ll help a friend of yours. \n\nOk that said.

            "Does he bring up \u201cthe past\u201d? My ex-husband shut me down every time I tried to discuss something that hurt me and wasn\u2019t solved. But HE would bring stuff up that happened 3 months before (or 3 years). Do not stay with a guy who acts like that. This is NOT OK. Abusive relationships don\u2019t start with physical aggression. The emotional, psychological abuse comes first. They groom you before they escalate. Please pay attention to red flags. Don\u2019t ignore them, don\u2019t look for excuses for them.",
