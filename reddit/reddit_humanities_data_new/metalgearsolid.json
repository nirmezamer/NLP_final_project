        "content": "Hello\n\nFrequently Asked Questions are pretty darn frequent these days!  Liking or Not Liking the Master Collection is also a very frequent topic.  \n\nTo address this we're taking two steps:\n\n1) We are updating the [FAQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/wiki/faq) in terms of technical/objective information.  There's probably a bit more we could change, add, and remove as we go, which we will, but for now this gives us something to point people to when we remove frequently asked questions.  If you're feeling generous or helpful, you could also leave a link to the FAQ on someone's repetitious post, or even answer it, when you report it.  Feel free to leave suggestions for the FAQ!\n\n2) Asking you to have your say here on the Master Collection debate.  Nobody wants to stifle genuine discussion or archival of what's been changed, what's been messed up, what's been done well, what could have been done better etc.  So please take the opportunity to answer the question 'What's the deal with the Master Collection?' in this thread.  Posts about this or that comparison, change, or whatever are getting repetitive with, more importantly, the exact same debates playing out over and over in the comment threads.  Nobody is going to change their mind and nobody is learning anything new any more.  \n\n*We aren't completely going to remove these posts outright because it's still an important topic*, but we will prune them for the most active, or the stuff that isn't just turning into more shitfights, whatever.  This thread will be a resource we can point to so that the information itself isn't buried, but the front page isn't just the same argument over and over again.  Please post your comparisons, videos, links to threads you've already made and so on here, as well as your well-reasoned, calm and polite written appraisals of the Master Collection Volume 1.",

            "Master Collection Versions\n\nPS5 Version: Pretty good. Seems to be the version with the most work put into it, as it is the only version to have properly rendered textures.\n\nSeries X Version: Many rendering issues. If possible, play the HD Collection through backwards compatibility instead.\n\nSwitch Version: Has frequent rendering and framerate issues. Go with a different version if possible.\n\nSteam Version (No Mods): Has the most problems of them all. Refer to the pinned bug/glitch mega thread for more info. Also, if you have weaker specs, purchase at your own risk, as MG1&2 and MGS2&3 may not run.\n\nSteam Version (With Mods): Extremely high quality experience. Easily the best version if you\u2019re willing to put in the work.",

            "Honestly, the Master Collection (on PS5 anyway) is pretty good. If you really wanna hate yourself, start with the MSX games, but if you want to enjoy life, I'd just start with MGS1. They explain what happens in MG1&2, so it's not that bad. I recommend to play in release order, so that the story unfolds as it was being written, and once you finish 3 you could go back and play MG 1 and 2.",
            "I can only attest to the PS5 version of the Master Collection, so...\n\nIt's totally serviceable and fine. If you've never played the MGS series before and you want to dive in, then it's a perfectly fine and convenient way to play. Sure, some might gripe about the resolutions or framerate of a PS1 game, but none of these things will have an impact whatsoever on your enjoyment of the series. \n\nYou still get to experience the stealth gameplay, awesome voice acting, superb presentation, awkward controls, and ridiculous plots of all these games. None of the minor technical issues of these ports will be noticeable to you, honestly.\n\nThe technical issues for the PS5 version of the collection are mostly noticed by purists who have played these games to death and can spot a minor difference a mile away. Again, for me personally, none of these issues REALLY matter all that much (except for missing analog controls for MGS1. Seriously wtf?)",
            "I can't speak for the other platforms or versions but so far, Snake Eater on PS4 is basically the HD version with altered controls. CQC actually works  without being a pain in the arse!",

            "My experience so far playing the Master Collection on Steam (with an Xbox Series controller, if you care to know):\n\n8-direction movement and slight input delay are hardly ideal in MGS1, but otherwise I don't think it's a *bad* way to play it, just one that takes getting used to. I'd still rather put up with control quirks than compromised content like in the old PC port. And hey, patches are on the way, so maybe they'll get fixed. In the meantime though, it's my understanding that the versions of the game on any PlayStation system from before the PS4 are better options if you have them (I do not.)\n\nMGS3 has really given me nothing to complain about, especially knowing I can boost resolution and texture filtering myself if I really want to. It feels like out of the main 3 games here, this is the one they knew they wanted to get right, and I'd basically say they have. I hear the Switch version isn't that bad either in spite of the limitations--guess it's the apology for the 3DS version, lol.\n\nHaven't touched MGS2 yet, may return to update about firsthand findings there when I have.",
            "I don't know if this really fits here, but it didn't feel like it was worth a whole thread. \n\nI'm getting the urge to do an MGS5 replay. I haven't played it since it came out. Considering legacy collection Volume 2 is likely to include it, should I wait? Do we think Konami is going to be able to bring the resolution and frame rate up to modern standards, considering how badly they bungled Volume 1? Planning on playing on PS5, as I still have my MGSV and GZ discs from PS4. \n\nAdditionally, is there any chance in hell they finish the game with this re-release?",

            "Metal Gear Solid 3 is such an amazing game and is my favorite one. It was the first Metal Gear game I played and did not regret it. MGS3's story and unique gameplay hold up without any need for sequels or prequels. If you are curious about Metal Gear, MGS3 to me is like Zelda Ocarina of Time- it's just a classic title that defines what the series is. If you are just genuinely curious about Metal Gear, MGS3 is actually a good place to start.   \n\n\nThere are two stories in Metal Gear, the story that happens in the game and the overarching story that takes place over multiple generations. You can understand MGS3 from scratch and start to unravel the bigger plot by playing all the games.",

MGSV just plays like enough third person shooters where you can learn the other mechanics on top of that. It also helps MGSV is the most forgiving game due to the sortie prep nature of the whole affair, with custom loadouts, weapons and buddy system at your disposal.\n\nThat being said I wish there sustenance and true stealth missions, luckily if your on PC you can use mods like Inf Heaven to really tweak mission parameters.",

There's two titles going WAY back as far as the NES, which do come in the new Master Collection. But...those are kinda for hardcore fans, so wouldn't recommend starting there. Metal Gear Solid for ps1 is probably gonna be the best place to start. And then in order from there on out. MGS for ps1 is a bit dated, but still functional. And you get enough back story to know what happened in the NES iterations.

Its expanded Japanese manual contains more artwork, including character portraits with English names, which you can see [here](https://archive.org/details/MetalGearJP/page/n9/mode/2up). It gives faces to the people you'll meet and contact in the game.\n\nThis should hopefully put the game in context for newcomers and make it easier to play, since none of this is included in the game itself (fairly standard for 1987). Finally, killing prisoners can make the game impossible to complete, so don't do it.\n\nFor MG2, wait past the intro credits without pressing any buttons to see its backstory.",

And I don't think the Patriots are really addressed in PW other than the fact that they exist and that Paz is working for them.",
            "Well, despite its graphics updates (wich really don\u2019t work on the majority of the consoles and ports since you need very specific settings like RTX graphic cards), the gameplay is the same as it was 10 years ago and as you said it is not outdated. \n\nAnd I say it\u2019s the same thing with MGS games. If you think they are outdated, you should look some of the videos some mods can do, without changing the gameplay.",

            "Specifically WHO Paz was working for is talked about in PW. Which is the same WHO that was behind the patriots as it's revealed in the end of MGS4 with *Redacted* wheeling him out in the graveyard scene.",
            "Nah that's a huge stretch and honestly Minecraft was a bad example for your argument.\n\nThe huge stretch is referencing mod support that is obviously not from Konami. Microsoft keeps Minecraft updated both graphically and gameplay wise. The old versions didn't even have a recipe list, you had to figure it out yourself. They updated mobs and overhauled the terrain generation multiple times.\n\nIf you wanna support MGS that's great, but don't lie to yourself and others by claiming the games aren't outdated in the most recent release. Let's cross our fingers for Delta and hope for the best.",

If anyone cares about my ranking then it\u2019d probably go:\n1.Solid(he\u2019s just so cool and honestly motivational on how even though his life is so tragic he keeps on moving forward all well being a good altruistic person he doesn\u2019t let all the tragedies in his life weigh him down well getting his mission done)\n\n2.Naked Snake aka Big Boss(I absolutely love his story in MGS3 it\u2019s basically Anakin Skywalker\u2019s from the prequel trilogy. He starts off as a good patriotic, a little bit more goofy and lighthearted person compared to Solid Snake, but after finding out the truth in the end about the boss he becomes morally bankrupt rouge warmonger as we see in the future games, we get to witness the tragic fall of a good hearted hero into a cold warmongering man. The reason I have him below Solid is because well I absolutely loved him in MGS3 I don\u2019t feel as strongly in his other games like peace walker and MGS5 which I\u2019m just not the biggest fan of story wise and no Hayter didn\u2019t help)\n\n3.Solidus(this spot is probably a hot take but he has to have one of the most unique motivations and thematic symbolisms in a video game ever kinda off the merit of how unique and bizarre MGS2 is in general, I also like how he\u2019s a anti villain rather than anti hero even though he could\u2019ve easily been made into one, he\u2019s still a morally bankrupt person, as to where I think most games would\u2019ve tried to make him a sympathetic anti hero throughout, but not Kojima he made sure to show through his dialogue and actions that even though his actions are noble he is going about it in a completely wrong way on top of just doing some unnecessary cruel things in the past and present not caring about anyone else\u2019s lives all well coming off as quite arrogant I think) \n\n4.Liquid (even though I just wrote Solidus a love letter Liquid is still a close third for me simply because he\u2019s just such an entertaining villain whenever he\u2019s on screen)\n\n5.Venom(really not that much to say about him honestly because he has like 5 minutes of actual dialogue throughout MGS5)",
            "Solid Snake feels the most developed.  Big Boss is cool but I dont feel like his games were as much about him outside of MGS3 and Peace Walker.  He feels like an entirely different character in 4.  Like, in 3, Portable Ops and Peace Walker he feels a lot like Solid Snake and that feels like it was done to make players comfortable.  But outside of those games he doesnt feel like the almost every man kind of guy anyone could talk to that he is in that prequel trilogy.",

He's had opportunities to acquire power but overall he chooses to do the right thing by his friends and the rest of the world. Hell he saw his brothers his father and the most powerful people all get corrupted yet he stayed strong. Gotta respect it",

It could've stopped anywheres after 3, PO, or Peace Walker, but then V happens and rather than take the opportunity to show Big Boss becoming more villainous and expanding on his side cast, it doesn't really do any of that and derails PW instead.\n\nSolid Snake didn't have this problem, but people's opinions on MGS4 can be mixed.\n\nPersonally, I think MG1/2 and MGS need to he remade at some point, because as presented, MGS3 is just really pleasant all around, whereas MGS was a bit rougher than I remembered, MG1/2 don't follow the current gameplay, and MGS2 isn't fully Snake's story.",
