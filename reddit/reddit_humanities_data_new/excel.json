Now I reckon I'm the best excel user at my company; using things like pivot tables, formulas like index match, macros often.\n\nMy role is changing to be more involved in accounting (such as management accounting) and financial reporting (preparing several kinds of budgets for various projects with supporting work such as transaction lists, BVAs, forecasting).\n\nI feel it I should try and develop my excel to a level further beyond but I'm not sure what would be most beneficial, cost effective and time efficient?\n\nIn the past, I always felt the excel certifications were never worth it and when I skimmed a few recently, I actually felt I have developed my excel skills independently to a level above most of them, although maybe someone who has done these can give better insight.\nI'm interested in learning about power query, power pivot, power BI. Also, maybe learning more about VBA or even a coding language like python (I have had several people tell me I should have taken up programming based on how I operate my excel sheets)\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar position or has knowledge and insight about this, would be grateful!",

            "We can\u2019t tell what role you started in here.  If you were outside accounting and moving in, I\u2019d recommend strengthening your accounting skills.  Your Excel skills are probably at this point better than most people I know in my team.  The arcane art of accounting speak does not always require much IMO, beyond skills in Pivots, Query, and dashboards.  But depending on your company size, that may be meaningless.  I just came from a multinational company with two Financial analysts who were solid in SQL. Moved to a family owned company with 2 \u201cFinancial Analysts\u201d whose advice to me when I started was \u201cdon\u2019t touch that area because that\u2019s *live data*.\u201d Points to a Pivot, pulling off a VBA Query, pulling financials out of Microsoft Dynamics.  I laughed when each said it\u2026wait\u2026\u201d\ud83d\ude33 Oh you think that\u2019s for real!\u201d  Then I slowed them dumb magic tricks, and now they let me do whatever I want to their Pivot. But you can\u2019t bluff your way through accounting because you must dot your Is and cross your Ts. And maybe that area is newer knowledge compared to your last position.\n\nIt\u2019s always easier to learn when you\u2019re on a team of highly skilled people.  If you\u2019re in your early career, you might consider the advantage of joining a bigger team, where you\u2019re not the smartest guy in the class.  There\u2019s usually money in that. Good luck.",

Lets say the company is using google workspace , then u can connect to it for whatever u see possible \n\nBut yea if the company is worth it, it\u2019s not necessarily a good thing to flaunt all these coz after all we\u2019re \u201ceasily replaceable\u201d but definitely look into these as part of your personal skill set",

            "Build things yourself. Identify a dataset that gets regularly updated (and ideally is large) and needs reshaping in some sense; automate that in power query. Then, once you're comfortable with dumping the output into a data table, try instead making it connection-only but with \"add to data model\". From power query you can then create a pivot table and do all your things, and then you'll see a bunch of other functions like measures and relationships that you can use to connect datasets together and make efficient calculated columns. \n\nI recently developed a reporting spreadsheet using power query, but the dataset was 800k rows a month so I quickly ran into excel's worksheet limits. But I could take it out of the spreadsheet and into the data model -- now it handles a decade of data, 40 million rows, on pivot tables. An absolute sea change, and now with power pivot's relationships I can simplify the queries and do \"lookups\" with similar ease.",
