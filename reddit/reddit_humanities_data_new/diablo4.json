            "Aaaaan, Blizzard does it again... it was too good to be true. Seeing an update on a Sunday (a new feature even !) really gave me hope that things are finally changing and they started caring about us, players... guess I was so wrong.  \nHow can you call th is a mid-season patch when you don't even twweak end-game content aother than lowering some bosses HP? Game clearly suffers from lack of engaging end-game content, and some serious class blance issues . \n\nSo here are some things I think will make people leave again after a few weeks. Just because Blizzard didn't bother touching any of them..\n\n- The lack of (at least) material drops in Pits after killing thousands upon thousands of mobs. OR AT LEAST ANGELBREATH... \n- Not being able to play with friends on an equal chance of masterworking mat drops \n- LACK OF AN ACTIVE TRADE / LFG channel and not being even able to chat in a bubble... not to mention lack of an auction house or at least a personal shopping / display stash where others can buy your items (similar to vendor).\n- NM dungeons being too easy and limited to 100.. \n- The tempering easily bricking valuable items with no chance to recover\n- Enchant and tempering chances to roll valuable/needed affixes.. tempering 4 times and getting the same stat on an item just sux ... \n- Vendor interface needs to let you rebuy ALL ITEMS you sold in the past 15-30-60min...just make them appear in empty slots of buyback.. seen lots of ppl actually selling their items in bigger bulks just because... \n-  ...well just because SAME KEY BINDING FOR FAV/JUNK ITEMS IS RETARDED !\n- AGAIN AND AGAIN - LACK OF SOME EXTRA STASH SLOTS (although you have room for 2-3 more on the left and on the right of the interface)... JUST GO SEE LAST EPOCH'S brilliant brilliant stash system... \n- The attack power being 100% irrelevant - missing damage/defense calculation formulas or a more detailed explanation at least ...\n- Lack of more visual hierarchy on items - If I have like 15 uniques of the same kind... at least let me see which one is better without having to check all those decimal numbers item by item.. or at least let me group items by kind and sort by affix values or smth..\n- The lack of mob health values or percentage display on health bar... or some DPS meter for players to assess their chances \n- Lack of visual hierarchy on already tempered / soulbound items\n- Lack of a button to sell-all X items in char invetory.. \n- The abyssmal interface of the paragon boards with not even the boards names and order written in the top corner. Simple as that...\n- Visually tweaking boss abilities so they stand out from for example Necro shit it puts on the ground.... I can never tell what's bad and what's good... or what's bad under something I know it's good. \n- Improve the HELLTIDE ITEM HAULING TO VENDOR... \n- Add an overlay map that you can always see.. EVERY ARPG has one, but not DIABLO 4 !!\n\n\nNone of these were addresed in any way... I don't say they should all be implemented, but at least have some polll about them or listen to friggin' players ... note that these are just ideas and I NEVER SAID SHOULD ALL GO IN THE GAME or smth... but at least a few of them would be nice and show players that someone actually cares about wehat they rant about...",

            "Let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room over Barb buffs. Let\u2019s be honest, what makes Barb op this season is tempering buffs. Bash cleave damage tempering. Thorns while fortified tempering. And dust devils tempering. It\u2019s not like basic skill damage, core skill damage, or weapon mastery damage has been balanced or changed. It\u2019s always the added stuff they put in, instead of balancing and making powerful what already exists.\n\nThe only class that has had that kind of change is necro minions.\n\nSeasons before it was always some broken min maxed thing that made barbs or other classes op. Why can\u2019t all basic, core, and mastery skills with all classes have a chance at end game content?",

            "Why can't sorc get a W in these patches? They need more damage. They only have 1 or two viable builds that are reasonably attainable. It makes me so sad knowing that a guy swinging a sword does expelonentually more damage and is econentially tankier than a sorcerer who has control of the elements at their fingertips. \n\nFor how squishy the sorc is, they need more damage ON EVERY SINGLE BUILD. Blizzard letting us down yet again. \n\nOnly one lightning skill has ever been viable in any season, and that was one season of lightning orb, and it WAS ONLY VIABLE BECAUSE OF A BUG. I honestly don't understand. Why even have a sorcerer this game if you don't know what the hell you're doing.",

So far I'm up to 70 in a few days and killing anything in sight. when this barb hits 100 it is going to embarrass the druid so bad and the worst part is it's more fun t o play on top of it.",
            "If that passive did ADDITIONAL poison damage... but taking away instant damage to make it poison doesn't make much sense except to proc other things.. and the idea of BUFFING it to make it LESS instant damage just feels like a joke to me sadly :\\\\",

            "I'm running a poison werewolf build and the patch is going to make my build way more powerful.  Boosting poison plus increasing aspect of the Alpha's companion bonuses will make my poison pack able to quickly kill.  Have just started pits, so I will see how high the build can go.  But at the same time, rabies+alpha+mad wolf's glee has been killing it for me all season and has been fun for me to play.",

            "Flay has poor mobbing without holy bolts. Since it relies on rupture for aoe dmg that doesn't scale with tempers.",
            "Heck, even before this you'd still see it on twisting blades because you could at least proc it through puncture.",
            "I\u2019d say that thorns absolutely should have been a more central part of the class from the start. Which is to say, if it was a part at all. But now with how much has changed since launch, reworking the class just for this one spirit boon feels like a waste of time\u2026.\n\n\nWhich is why they\u2019ll probably do exactly what you said lol",
            "Consider it acknowledged.",
            "They have",
            "Watch fireside chats and streamer interviews. They have said they agree.\n\nIt will get addressed eventually.",
            "Pretty sure its on their radar as something players want",
            "They\u2019ve literally discussed it in multiple Q&A.\n\nIt has to do with how the actual boss dungeon zones are programmed and need to reset.",
            "They have acknowledged this - it was talked about in the last round of interviews Blizzard did with content creators prior to season 4 launch (I think Adam Jackson talked about it). They said this wasn't how dungeons were designed and by the sounds of it significant changes were required to add this. It definitely seemed like something that was on the radar for them.",
            "Boss rooms should be exactly like blood maiden.  Would be cool to have four summon alters and each alter you fill adds more loot.  Then you could also have groups fill one alter each to make group farming rotations smoother.",
            "Yeah, and this is the kind of quality of life improvement they've made in the past, like letting you TP directly into nightmare dungeons.",
            "Well... I would totally be ok with a vendor unlocking caches from the bosses if you can kill them fast enough and you have killed them a few times already. You have killed varshan 5 times i less than 3 seconds?  Varshan cache is unlocked in a boss merchant. At least the duriel/andariel mats \n\nThe exit-reset-enter-walk-summon-oneshot loop to burn the materials is terrible and need a rework. The ice beast is even worse. Just a time sink. Not fun or challenging.",

Just in time for the expansion.\n\nThis season was fun, got my first lvl 100 character, but I just can't take the loot grind. Playing every day for a couple of hours has given me ONE 2GA item. Every single fucking day doing the grind and that's my price.\n\nI hit my personal wall and it's the god damn loot grind.",
            "Weird, my golem necro had no issues getting up into the 90\u2019s and would farm 85\u2019s for MW gear with 4-8 MW level on most stuff and maybe 2 or 3 pieces that had more than just 1 GA (no GA\u2019s on talent point stats).\n\nYou have to change your play style a lot though once it gets higher because you will get one shot easy. So basically pretend you\u2019re MC Hammer while your golem is the kool aid man.",
            "Barb should be able to get to around 90 pretty easily with 4-8 MW on good gear. I have MW 4 on boots, amulet, and helm, and 8 on the rest and got to pit 97. I wouldn't say I have outstanding gear either, a few have one GA and a few could be upgraded if I got a useful GA.  \n  \nFor reference I'm at  \n57% Crit Chance  \n841% Crit Damage  \n647% Damage vs Close  \n297% Damage while Berserk  \n65% in all Resistances",

            "Or maybe Stygian Stones, I feel it would be a good compromise and they're tradeable.\n\nEDIT: Although this would create a problem of it being too valuable and nobody doing Tormented Bosses to save on them. I think best solution is really a new currency or item for that.",
            "I personally think scattered prisms are too easy to get for them to allow temper rerolls. I have 717, although granted like \\~400 are from farming goblins over the last week. But even before they buffed the droprates earlier in the season, I had 100 or so.\n\nI think a better solution is to just make smaller incremental changes and see how they feel/play out. If I was Blizzard, I'd first maybe not allow the same temper stat to be rolled twice in a row (this is a big frustration when you get 3 of the same stat in a row that you don't want), allow players to keep an existing roll, like you can with enchanting, and maybe better categorize temper stats. Some temper manuals have stats for 3 or 4 different skills in them and you specifically only want one of them, whereas the other 3 are often useless for your build. Some temper manuals already do this. The \"sandstorm\" manual for dust devils is a good example. Each stat in that manual is specific to dust devils stats, so even if you don't get the one you're looking for, the item is still very usable, or you can juggle it around with other items etc.\n\nI think these changes alone would really help and we could see from there if we still need to make more.",

            "It's very silly that I can have the same number of aspects as other classes, and still wear 2-3 game-changing uniques. I don't even have to make the choice between one-hand and two-hand when it comes to powerful aspects. My \"tough choices\" are whether I want to use a 2H Axe for more of one kind of damage, or a 2H Sword for more of another kind of damage.",
            "That was a fun gaming session broski \ud83d\udcaa",

            "Happy people spend money.\n\nI figure more people play barb than any other class.",
            "I mean, yeah that\u2019d be ideal, but let\u2019s not pretend that most of these changes are based on player feedback. Blizzard balances based on numbers, which is why it\u2019s so confusing that Barb gets more buffs and tweaks when they are clearly in a much stronger place than 3/5 classes.",
            "Barb flay build literally is one of the highest pit clearing builds currently and it got nothing but buffs lmao.",

            "Non of the paragon nodes are X multipliers, they are all additive.",
            "In context a 1% buff can be a bigger change than it seems\n\nLike changing Glass Cannon from 3/6/9% to 2/4/6% shouldn't be thought of as a 1,2,3% change, it's a 30% percent reduction in the added damage\n\nOr Combustion going from 2% to 4% per source... the numerical change is 2% but it's effectively doubling the bonus",
            "Meanwhile my gf rolled a thorns barb, right now it's 90 and she's carrying me (a 100 Druid with all level 4 masterwork) in the pits, I might just quit playing.",

Tornados and spew volcanos from my ass and decimate my whole screen. Diablo 4 doesn\u2019t allow me to play my windyboy fantasy.  I get to play a rapid dog that farts tornados.  Great",

            "Can you tell who ever is handling changes to stop buffing barbs and to buff sorcs. I\u2019ve played a sorc every season and they consistently perform like shit while getting one shot. I\u2019m fine with being one shot if the damage output is the highest of everyone. That is the definition of a glass cannon. But sorcs can\u2019t output enough damage to kill things to survive. The only viable build is a immortal flame shield build which makes it impossible to kill end game bosses. I also doubt the intent was to create an immortal build anyway. Buff sorcs skills and paragons in a meaningful way please. \n\nPs. All of our paragon and glyphs that require \u201cchilled\u201d or CC is useless against bosses. Either apply cc debuffs without affect or remove/change some of those requirements. \n\nThanks.",
            "Lmao that is so true",
            "Yeah the system is good but definitely needs a pass through to refine affix groups even if they don't ease the limitation on amount of rolls.\n\nTo expand on the scattered prism idea would be to increase the amount needed for every extra roll added to an item. Burning through the 100 or however many you have pre goblin event would happen pretty quickly, even on a single item with bad rng (or fishing for a perfect roll), which would be good imo. Doubt the community at large would be okay with that though lol.\n\nThey are easier to get now (was a bit of an overcorrection when they buffed it in typical blizz fashion), but some of that is also due the slowdown of finding upgrades in endgame so they pile up. Spreading their use into another system would put more pressure on their need.\n\nI'm also mostly okay with tempering as it is now but with the amount of noise around the issue a change is inevitable. Bricking to me is whatever but I know I'm in the minority on that. Would prefer something like your solution, but if they go the material route I don't really want to see a brand new tempering material and definitely want them to avoid full resets, and definitely don't want it to be basically automatic or free.",

            "but the rest of us understand how multipliers work, so keeping the marketing speak out *doubled the damaged for x passive* actually means a .001% increase in multipliers doesn't do it for us chief",
            "Yup. Played dolmen earlier this season. Super fun idea, horrible execution. \n\nIf they fix it to pull enemies inward rather than pushing them away + fix the \u201ceye of the storm\u201d issue + make it so wallers and suppressors don\u2019t instantly drop your dps to zero\u2026. then we can talk.",

This could work with poison. Maybe it would be too busted but thorns is very one dimensional in a boring way. When you put it that way - that the entire class needs near-redo, I\u2019m a lot more interested in them integrating thorns instead of throwing them out. \n\nLightning thorns though\u2026 imagine the possibilities.",

Don\u2019t allow them to drop yellows or regular legendary gear.  To offset the item count drop, have them drop gem shards and angel breath, maybe prisms, crafting mats, or a health pile of gold exploding.\n\nWHY?:  The change to resummon without exiting and resetting is a huge welcome bonus, but it wont necessarily \u201cfix\u201d zoning back to town to sell if we\u2019re getting flooded with loot per run of basically 99.9% salvage/sell.\n\nThe problem is if not, people are going to obviously \u201cinventory dump\u201d junk in a corner/on the floor which is going to rapidly clutter the boss arena, to the point it\u2019s going to be annoying/to much on screen.  Anyone who\u2019s been in a group with friends who dump outside the dungeon knows exactly what I mean, it quickly becomes a screen saturated with trash loot.  It\u2019s cool to see it the first few times, but after awhile it\u2019s actually annoying.\n\nThey can still leave non tormented boss versions as is to drop regular loot as people might still be gearing up and might need that gear, even if it\u2019s not GA.",

Yes it will be less tedious to get to the loot, but if you routinely one-shot the boss right now, this will reduce the task to \u201cclick altar, click boss, pick up GA. Click altar, click boss, pick up GA\u2026\u201d It\u2019s going to be a bit on-the-nose for literally \u201cfarming a boss\u201d don\u2019t you think? Like, FarmVille farming?

It eliminates the Dungeon-crawl aspect from Diablo, which was sorely lacking before, but which I guess will get replaced by whatever Raids are going to look like\u2026 \n\nEDIT: sorry, people are commenting to say that this is an improvement compared to how it is now but kinda missing the real problem. I should have said disappointed, not \u201ctorn.\u201d Like, yes I agree it\u2019s gonna be SUPER fast but the most viable method of getting the best items is basically a slot machine room now. \nAnd I TOTALLY understand that some people fucking LOVE slot machines (to the point that it\u2019s considered a mental health problem) but this is ultimately a reduction in the game cycle, whereas a real improvement would have been additional actual content and opportunity for challenging fun. I\u2019m playing the \u201clong term health of the game\u201d card - this doesn\u2019t fix it, it makes the underlying problem more obvious.\n\nAlso when they showed off the clip of this during the stream, Duriel\u2019s giant dead body was still sitting there while the new Duriel spawned in. They might wanna fix that corpse-layover or else we won\u2019t be able to see the fight after 10 rounds lol",

However, that approach was still available to those who wanted to and was a good method for target farming specific uniques. \n\nI don\u2019t have a better answer for D4 unfortunately because I do like that there is a deterministic way to farm specific uniques\u2026maybe up the chance for mythics to drop in other WT4 activities so boss spamming isn\u2019t hands down the most efficient method.",

I expect that the Sorc will do a bit better in that end game content as it is more tuned towards their strength.  I would also expect Pulverize Druids to excel in it since that build felt really strong when you had 3+ targets to fight.\n\nAgain not saying balance is perfect, I just think people look at balance in an absolute way like the current end game mechanic is the only thing that defines balance and it isn't the best way to look at it.",

I suppose it's not *that* different from farming Baal runs bitd, especially since some people waited years for their chosen drop, but I think there's some extra pepper on the slap when you have a potentially amazing weapon brick out on you.

In the process, coverts the yellow into the legendary and rerolls the stats, with the potential to GA the original affixes. The process shouldn't be cheap and the new item loses one temper charge, the resulting item can be imprinted again to another yellow and, again, loses another temper chance. This process cant be repeated up until the temper rolls are 0. This gives yellows a purpose and basically gives bricked items some value and more chances to reroll at a cost and eventually brick.",

That would be organic risk, it is also under user control.\n\nOn the other side you can just slap a mandatory roll mechanic with a hard failure mode and call it a day.\nThere are people who get a rush from succeeding against synthetic odds like this, but as far as i know, it is one of the traits that people with gambling addictions usually have.\n\nSo far, the tempering reroll mechanic is what has been keeping me away from the game this season.",

            "Yeah, thank god they chose to appease the ~5% of the playerbase who probably buy most of their gear on 3rd party sites or have a gambling problem, instead of the rest that will probably just quit instead of farming 200 hours to finally get one upgrade in gear only to have it roll the same useless stat 5 times in a row.\n\nThank GOD they chose that.

The problem is that for many of the options, only _one_ of the rolls has any effect at all on your spec while the others do not. If you don't roll the one stat you wanted, the item is an instant downgrade no matter how many greater affixes it has. \n\nThey don't need to increase the amount of rolls or make it unlimited, even if honestly I don't see the problem with being able to reset the roll counter with another gold sink. What they do need to do is make sure that me not hitting the one temper I want doesn't mean I get a temper that does absolutely nothing for me. Instead of having four different options saying \"add x% chance to cast [skill] twice\" they should do something like \"add x% chance to cast core skills twice.\" The other three options could be other things that are still useful, like \"after casting a core skill four times, the fifth explodes for x% extra damage\" or \"casting a core skill has an x% chance to mind control enemies hit to fight for you for five seconds.\" Something like that anyway. If instead of targeting each individual skill they instead come up with effects that affect _all_ core skills, you would not be bricking an item no matter what you roll. There will obviously be an optional choice as there always is, but with proper tuning, the other options would still be good and usable.",

You made a declarative statement that system works a certain way, with no proof, then are dismissing anyone who disagrees with you because they don\u2019t have proof? \n\nHaving a few bad experiences is not proof of anything. Weighted tempering doesn\u2019t even make sense - people are going to be looking for different affixes for different builds, so If it weighted against one build it would weighted towards another. \n\nThis would be easy to prove. Someone could just try to temper, say a bunch of weapons 500 times trying to get a specific affix and see what the percentages are on results.

Also GAs aren\u2019t required to do the end game so as long as you have a legendary bow with decent affixes that\u2019s all you NEED. Then the bonus WANT of GA tempered items should be risky",
            "I agree with you in general, but if that perfect item took 200 hours to drop and 20 seconds to brick, you won't see most people willing or excited to grind for another item like it. It needs to be balanced somehow. Just like removing bricking would make the system pointless, the extreme slog of finding GA items that even have the fix you want and then immediately becoming salvage is total disrespect to the players time imo.\u00a0\n\n\nI've thought maybe just splitting all the tempers in half and having more temper manuals may be a good idea but perhaps make it too easy. I'm not sure but there is a solution somewhere out there",

I would be okay with there being a fee we could pay, whether in mats or gold, to eliminate 1 Tempering affix from the list when rolling to increase our odds. So if there was 5 possible choices, maybe we spend double the cost of the Temper and eliminate one of those and drop it down to 4.

If they just increased the number of temper rolls, decreased the effectiveness of each temper but allowed multiple rolls on a given stat you would have a crafting system much more like Last Epoch\u2019s excellent one. It would still be rare to get perfect rolls, but you would consistently get a good item rather than it being either godlike or vendor trash.",
            "I think items should drop with tempers, and you still get one free. That way loot can still drop as good, instead of everything being just a base for the item it becomes. \n\nThis has no downside, and adds back the thrill of an instant equip upgrade",

And main stats such as max life and strength are more likely to be seen, which you can see when looting gear also and is also a good thing as most specs want those core stats.\n\nTempering however, nah, theres no reason for it to be weighted.

            "Let's unpack it anyway since I'm bored.\n\nName me a single build in the game that can be ruined by \"\"\"bricking\"\"\" a low(est) roll on FCR or IAS item. Name one. And mind you, we're talking about a single item here. \n\n2 25% FCR spirits on a hammerdin or sorc? Extremely easy to shore up the missing FCR to hit your 75% breakpoint. Your build is NOWHERE NEAR bricked if you can hit that measly 75% which is extremely easy to do.\n\nFCR then. On what build exactly? Zealot? Pitbarb (lol what is Frenzy)? Yeah just completely \"\"\"bricked\"\"\" with that low IAS roll on the Grief, nevermind the Fana aura or the million other ways to increase your IAS.\n\nIf it takes you an entire year to find an item base as well as the runes to make said runewords, I can actually confirm you're retarded and or didn't play LoD (hint you can actually trade for shit).\n\nI'd tell you to also use your brain but I think you're lacking the required affix for it kek",
            "I did not say they were going to remove bricking. But the system will function like enchanting with limited tries. Mark my words! \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo you will do your first freebie, then get to keep your roll or try for another one. I cannot see any other way to give us agency over it.",
            "It also has nothing to do with ARPG's.\n\nARPG's are allabout grinding for that perfect drop that FINALLY gets you to min maxing, not about finally dropping something godlike just to throw it into a slot machine to see if the gods are smiling upon you.\n\nThe drop is the ARPG Looting experience, not the tempering.",
            ">  a BIS item in a week\n\nYes a BIS item in a week, singular. The idea that you have \"nothing to chase\" in \"a few hours of gameplay\", as you claimed, is completely fantastical bollocks. Even with no bricking, anyone who wasn't a streamer being fed items by his devoted catamites is going to take many weeks to get even close to BIS. Multiple months. And that's playing pretty serious amounts, not \"a few hours of gameplay\".\n\nHow long do you think seasons even last? You people want to spend 8 hours a day farming for 3 months straight and still come up short? Because that's what you seem to be saying.",
            "Your reading comprehension is not good.\n\nGo reread what he said and then delete this comment.",
            "No, I should play only games that reward me for time spent. \nAnyway thanks, I'm thinking to stop playing this season already, as I didn't find single better item I have equipped for 2 weeks.",
            "I don't disagree. But rng is and always has been a part of it. That was my point",
            "Nice! I really like that idea. Tapering how many times you can reroll with each reset feels like a great middle ground.",
            "Well, since they're saying they need it then I would imagine they're at the \"absolute endgame\".",
            "sure you don't need that. but thats the final chase loot of the game. And that should be the final chase loot of the game. not some 1/2GA with the right tempers.",
            "Yes there is \u2014 you\u2019ve added back in more stats to sift through in your inventory when a large part of the point of this whole overhaul was knowing at a glance if you have a good base.",
            "I know, and I'm saying an item dropping with base Tempers is functionally just the same (but worse) as just giving players +1 Temper reroll.\n\nI mean I guess the one difference is it wouldn't be BoA until you Temper it.",
            "I do agree with the person you replied to that _finding_ the loot should be the hard part. Finding it and then bricking it feels awful and makes me want to stop playing for the rest of the day more often than not.\n\nThey should rework tempering in such a way that each of the options you could roll is at least _useful_ to any build. Rolling a bonus on a skill that I'm not using should not be possible. They should instead make bonuses that affect all skills in a certain category, but each in a unique way. That way rolling the \"wrong\" temper would still be useful even if it's not the best option.",
            "Wait I\u2019m confused. You just said you have seen multiple 3 GA items\u2026 just like I did.. but I\u2019m insanely lucky? I\u2019m confused. Are you being bad faith in order to support my argument? LOL",
            "I think if they provide relief through things like GA items getting more tempers (and more on top of that) we can have the best of both worlds. But if tempering didn\u2019t brick it sounds like you would have been done with the season really fast",
            "Well me and the 200+ blizzard employees that upvoted this just don\u2019t agree I\u2019m sorry. And since my dad owns Blizzard you\u2019re never getting rid of tempering AHAHAHAHAHA OUR EVIL PLAN IS WORKING",
            "This is why I still subscribe to the cope of tempering junk items - if RNG is seeded, that means there can be a string of possible results that are completely the same so working your way through a couple attempts MIGHT work, depending on how the RNG is coded.\n\nIf the RNG seed is simply a background number that works across all items, then the strategy works.\n\nIf it's ***item*** dependent though (results are tied to the item regardless), then you're screwed either way.\n\nI liken this to the Decoration sniping from MHW - ostensibly RNG but actually a fixed string of results - people discovered how to work their way through the list of results until they got something good.",
            "\ud83d\ude2e This is a brave soul",
            "Fair enough.",
            "Nothing wrong with yoloing your gear man. It's a game not a job.",
            "Why are you lying?\n\nThis is your comment:\n\n>The issue is how affixes are weighted.\u00a0\u00a0 The whole system needs a rework not more temper chances.\n\n>Edit: so unless someone posts evidence otherwise the math I am seeing actually shows my claim of tempering being weighted is wrong, it's not.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n>Still stand by my point the system needs a rework, it does not feel good in its current form\n\nYou are still saying that it's weighted, you are still asking others to disprove your own baseless argument and you make no mention of how you pulled it out of your ass.\n\nSo, once again, where is the edit showing how you pulled the weighting out of your ass?",
            "Eschuta could be rolled very badly lol",
            "hint you can actually trade for 3GAs in D4. Lol if you are talking trading then your arguments are invalid. You NEVER run out of items to brick if trading is involved, but since you don't look bright enough to figure this out, I am afraid I have to point it out for you. Eventually you will have what you want, provided you can trade for the 3GAs you need.",
            "Oooh I\u2019m sorry. I misunderstood. I thought you meant like the resource cost just keeps getting higher",
            "Oh I did I think you might need to reread it!",
            "You probably found some better ones but bricked them, that was my experience at least. I agree with you though. If I wanted a way to lose my items through gameplay I\u2019d go back to hardcore.\u00a0",
            "I think it'd be neat. If you make it costly enough to sting a little, you still get to apply that feeling of pressure to the player, which is the second best part of these games, and still have a much higher chance of applying that feeling of winning and relief, which is the best part. You can reasonably have both!",
            "The first 3 stats still have to be good dude.",
            "How is it worse?",
            "He said he has zero but has SEEN a few. Which means that they are not only super rare but when you actually find one the chances are the affixes are bad so it's not worth keeping.\n\nLet's use your own example. \n\nYou found 4 GA items in 40 hours. Out of those 4, how many were usable? Then let's do the math, let's say you're playing a Druid. You have 10 items slots. Out of those 10, let's assume you're using 2 uniques for your build. \n\nSo in a perfect world where items don't brick, you need an average of 80 hours of gameplay to find your 8 3GA and fill your item slots. \n\nA person that works 9 to 5 and has a family doesn't normally have more than 1 hour / day and maybe 5 more hours over the weekend. So 10 hours a week of gameplay. That's 2 months to fill your item slots with perfect gear. AGAIN, THIS IS IN A PERFECT SCENARIO, where you found 1 3GA item with the exact affixes you need one every 10 hours and they don't brick.  2 months our of a 3 months season. And that's only ONE character, most people like to build multiple characters per season and I used the druid as the example cause it has less item slots.\n\n\"Oh, but you don't need perfect 3GA items to do everything in the endgame\" \n\nNo? Streamers and whales have barely passes pit 150.\n\nIf your goal is to just complete a character that can destroy helltides, I agree, you barely need any gear, but lots of people like to chase the best gear possible or at least close to it. The way the system is now, unless you RMT or have gear spoonfed to you cause you're a popular streamer, you won't ever come close to that. \n\nI'm not one of those people that feels the need to have perfect gear, but I totally understand where they are coming from and most important of all: Diablo is a looter game, I'll repeat, looter. \n\nThe excitement should come from the loot you find. Right now, finding an amazing item is not exciting, it's actually anxiety inducing since the item has a great chance of becoming trash. I found a couple 3GA items and I wasn't excited at all even before seeing the affixes (Which were pretty bad). \n\nOn the other hand, every single time I drop a divine orb while playing POE I get a dopamine hit cause I know I'm building my wealth and getting closer to that mageblood. I never dropped one myself, but I can imagine how it feels to drop a full mageblood or a mirror.  This is what I miss on D4. There aren't enough exciting drops. Dropping that Ber rune on D2 felt amazing, I wanna feel that with drops on D4 instead of feeling anxious before tempering an item.",
            "There is no best-of-both-worlds when you can brick an item at the blacksmith AFTER you find it.  Thats what im saying.  They have moved the excitement to town. I dont want to be excited in town.  I want to sell/drop off my loot in town and be excited to kill monsters.  I dont want a slot machine to tell me if the farming was worth it.\n\nIts not a dealbreaker yet.  Yet.",
            "You need reading comprehension that is not what that edit says, have a good day troll.\u00a0\u00a0You are literally only the second person to read it that way",
            "That's what they deserve for not playing a cold sorc.",
            "Your main argument was that you can \"brick\" builds in diablo 2 in the same vein that you can in diablo 4 and my main argument is that your attempt to compare the 2 games is disingenuous and not based in fact/experience. I merely pointed out that it can not and should not take you an entire year to make a runeword because you can trade for any and all items. I'm aware of the (limited) trading options in diablo 4. \n\nYou still have not provided any kind of examples of bricking builds in diablo 2. Perhaps you don't understand what bricking actually is?\n\nDo i want +light radius on a piece of gear? No, not really. Do I want +14 life after each kill on a piece of gear? No, not really. But do I want them IN LIEU of something useful? Fuck no because that would be retarded aka rolling damage to distant enemies on a barbarian weapon. Shit like this literally cannot happen in diablo 2 because that game actually has a well thought out loot/gear system. Hence, you cannot brick an item. 25% fcr spirit? Not bricked. 2 of those, plus a magefist and 1 10% fcr ring and i'm now over the 75% fcr breakpoint. Perfectly viable and even strong build.\n\nI could go on but you're just an idiot and I feel like i'm getting dragged down to your idiot level.",
            "Well said!!! Gotta keep that balance without trivializing the experience! \n\nI just hope the devs can find that balance. Otherwise, I fear tempering is just going to be in a shitty place until they do.",
            "Which has what to do with what I said about adding reading time when sifting through your inventory, a thing they just went to great lengths to cut down?",
            "I just explained.",
            "It\u2019s worse because a random bow drop could have any tempers on it, even if you make it so only rogue tempers are rolled on it, it still is pulling from all relevant rogue manuals, whereas if the devs granted +1 temper roll instead of your change, the player would choose which manual to temper from. Still not guaranteed, but pulling from 5 options instead of 20 or whatever results in better odds for the player.",
            "I'm #3 then. I understand what you mean now that you've explained it, but it's not the easiest sentence to read.",
            "Well, I certainly wouldn't want to be responsible for you reading more",
            "Just imagine this - Two free tempers. No category restriction. The same amount of rerolls. Where is the downside here?",
            "I did not say to do this instead of +1 temper rolls. And yes, it could have any temper. Even ones better than what you have available, and ones you just don't want. However, you have the exact same amount of opportunities to reroll them. It is in fact, +2 to the total potential rolls you can have, since you have two free ones to begin with. Is this making more sense now?",
            "Thanks, see this is useful feedback.\u00a0 I'll re-write it\n\n\nChanged, hope it's more clear for you",
            "The reason you don\u2019t have anything to offer except a snide remark is because your idea does, in fact, have a downside that Blizzard specifically addressed with the Loot Reborn changes and it\u2019s okay to admit that. Cutting down time spent in town by reducing reading 5 affixes per item to 3 was a HUGE thrust of all the changes in the first place.",
            "How is there no category restriction when the Temper is already on the item when it drops?\n\nThat's the downside. You don't get to choose what category the free temper is.",
            "I understand what you\u2019re saying bro \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc making me laugh seeing how often you\u2019re trying to explain this and people just aren\u2019t quite getting what you\u2019re saying. I think it would be cool to see gear drop with tempers."
