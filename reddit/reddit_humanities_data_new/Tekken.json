But the song is soo fucking fire!\n\nI'm also tripping balls right now. Hehe\n\nGlad I finally decided to search for a tekken sub! I have tons of questions on how to get better. Been playing since I was 5 years, I'm 32 now. Man, time is a bitch. Booting up Tekken 7 for the first time on PS5. \n\nI've watched a lot of videos and they've used abbreviations for square and triangle (triangles seem like the sub meta rn lol) etc., and a lot of the movements such as the Korean backdash seem a little intimidating, but I'm always up for a challenge. Before we could afford/my Parents even thought we would need internet; I thought I was hot shit for knowing a 10 hit or two! Lmao. Seeing what some people have elevated this game to is amazing!\n\nI have taken far too much of your/my time to read/type this so, much love guys!",

I use a Ps4 controller and I have a question: Right now I play with this layout:\n\n\\- R1: 2+4\n\n\\- R2: 1+2\n\n\\- L1: 1+3\n\n\\- L2: 3+4\n\n\\- L3: 1+4\n\n\\- R3: 2+3  \n\n\nThis layout has been very good for me, but I have a problem when doing the 1 + 4 buttons, I grab the controller normal, not claw grip or anything, just normal, like playing any other game. The problem is that I actually do not use the L3 (1+4) because it feels weird and I actually go faster by switching to claw grip for a second to press those 2 buttons, but still I think that is a little bit slow. Any suggestions about this? I play mainly King, I need 1+4 for example for the first part of the rolling death craddle.",
            "How do I deal with fighting a character ive never seen before or maybe only once in a hundred games? I just got my 100th win on Steve and my next game was against an Eliza. Needless to say I lost badly barely understood what she was even doing then they denied the rematch. Do I just ignore the rarer match ups? Accept that once in a hundred games I just have to lose to an Eliza or Ganryu? Or is there some \"trick\" to dealing with matchups you dont know and are unlikely to ever face often. I mean it can be hard enough to simply understand what to do against King not mention the other 50 people doing god knows what. Thanks.",
            "I have always liked playing Tekken, as I like okizeme and many friends of mine are better than me at it. But for some reason, the game didn't really click with me as I've always felt sloppy at it. Too many things I was failing at once.\n\nHowever, lately we've been playing Tekken 3 and holy shit, this game is sick. Being able to actually react to stuff is satisfying as all heck. I've come to the hypothesis that this happened because it being a PSX game, it has to have simpler graphics, and so the visual input is easier to process.\n\nI'll keep playing Tekken 3, as that's where the fun's at for me, but for whenever I want to play the game I actually have:\n\nWhat are some ways to make Tekken 7 more visually toned down without missing out on the essential information?\n\nExamples of things I want to turn off for matches: [low-mid-high attack indicators]\n[that weird flash for when you go into rage]\n[the bloom of some visual effects some character do when landing powerful hits]",

I keep getting into his gameplan because I get impatient when he's always blocking or keeping out. I got annoyed and salty the more I played this match up. I watched videos about Alisa's strengths and weaknesses, I also did punishment training in training mode, but I guess it's not enough. I also get open up by Alisa, maybe because I don't know her mixups. I say this about high standards and pressure because my thought process of why I get annoyed was \"imagine if this is a tournament, I feel like I'm trash\" \"I want to experience playing in a tournament for the fun and experience. If I can't handle this, then I dont think I'm worthy.\" My friend said this mindset is unhealthy and I agree, it's just that it's gonna take a lot of time to change that mindset of mine. \n\nWe're both 1st dan, btw. \n\nAny thoughts about this would be appreciated, thanks.",

I watch YouTube guides, try to implement the coaching, but it feels like nothing is working? It feels like no matter how much I play I can\u2019t progress. Everyone I play seems to have an ungodly amount of skill way higher than mine. It presents the question. Are the very most beginner ranks flooded with smurfs or am I just that bad at Tekken and need to find a new hobby, because this is dreadful.",
            "Guys I can't win a single round, why can't I press buttons without getting countered meanwhile my opponent is free to do whatever they want and hit me no matter what?

What am I doing wrong?",
            "I feel like the knowledge checks and cheese in this game has gotten out of hand, combined with the janky tracking and inconsistent sidesteps im really holding out hope for T8 to put a damper on the nonsense situations but it looks like this is baked into Tekken at this point. I don't think mid evasive moves are reasonable and some characters have really obnoxious okizeme that just feels bad to go up against. \n\ng3t g00d scrub.

Its nice being able to clutch a round or two, but IDK if going quick match is better to learn or I just learn in ranked and risk losing points.\n\nI moved from ranked because I am still barely yellow rank and having a hard time, I move to quick match and have an even worse time. \n\nIDK wtf to do my god...\n\nI might just quit this game. After 3 weeks trying to learn Paul, getting stuck at yellow ranks, doing unranked matches and getting blown up there (granted to people of higher rank than I), watching videos, doing replays, labbing more, etc. I just can't get it. \n\nLike I said I moved to unranked today after getting myself back to Assailant and don't want to lose it again so I go play some casual matches and just taking L after L. 3 weeks and its just constant losses.

Before this I only played anime fighters like GG, UNI, and Blazblue so I know there wont be a 100% accurate comparison. From the games i've played, Chipp was probably \"my\" character.

So, how can I improve further than this by using practice mode? Should I keep working on my fundamentals? Should I start to learn combos with her? or researching on how to counter moves everytime I played an online match? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, does anyone have a hard time using the xbox 360 controller to play this game?

When I was in low ranks it was usually pretty straightforward: look for punishable moves that you missed, see if there are any holes in that string they spam, and that's it.\n\nNow when people have started altering their approach I'm sometimes just stumped. As an example, what should I look for [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAb_Zkout_4)? My opponent isn't spamming, isn't being too trigger happy, just kinda hovering around. Yet whenever I try to pressure, I eat a launcher, and if I don't, I'm getting outpoked.\n\nWhat am I overlooking?",

I also liked how Dragunov feels when I was playing him but I don't know much else otherwise. Steve just looks really cool but I keep hearing that he's super technical and difficult so it's kinda shying me away from playing him.\n\nI haven't tried Julia and Lidia hands on yet but I was interested in them due to some clips and content creators/pros talking about them.  \n\n\nSo out of all of them which one would be the best?",

I have some problems with a lot of moves from the characters, one example i can give, is the Steve gatling gun. i play on a controller. but i'm not super annoyed on this because i'm a new player and don't have the ideal coordination and sometimes i panic lol...i played the story mode, and got to online matches because that was the thing that i wanted to play the most, and i had some good games specially with zafina. but i couldn't manage to get too far. i faced some people that was very good on their characters, i remember of one kazuya that had like 300 games with him and i was matched with him. he wasn't like super good, but he was some steps ahead, and this was a bit sad, but i always give my best to fight the others, it doesn't mean if their 20 ranks above me, if i can land a combo on them i'm already happy. i'm thinking on coming back, because i miss my characters, and want to play this game. so i was wondering what are your suggestions. and also, how do i face those players that only walks backwards and spam only one move?

If it's Eliza for example, find a good Eliza player, ideally one better than you, have them run some sets with you in between you labbing the character. Play actively, listen to their advice and develop your game plan in the matchup and fix your mistakes. 10x more effective if you can play offline. Maybe find another Eliza player and play them as well to get some experience with different playstyles, flowcharts etc.\n\nEDIT: Also, no there are no tricks. These matchups are complex and you need to familiar with the situations they present (eventually). Good spacing, movement, whiff punishment is great and universal but it's only a piece of the puzzle. You can only really start playing the matchup 'properly' once you have accumulated that required knowledge and experience.\n\nBut again this is the great plateau that people reach long after they have learned all their characters stuff, so please don't worry about these fine details at least until you are a thousand hours in.

            "We see this question all the time. The ranked system is not intuitive, but once I've played enough, you'll see that it makes sense.\n\nYou're rewarded most for defeating your immediate peers. Those battles are always worth the most. You're rewarded slightly less for defeating someone one rank in either direction (if the person is one rank above you, you do win slightly more for beating them than if you beat someone one rank below you, and you lose slightly less against the higher rank than you would a lower rank). Fighting someone two ranks away still gets you a small chunk, and then three ranks or more away you only get a negligible amount.\n\nThis prevents boosting (a higher ranked friend helping you rank up), and it prevents higher ranks from being disincentivized to fight lower ranks. If you won a lot of points for beating someone way higher than you, then the shift in points would have to be balanced by having you lose a lot for losing to someone way lower than you. But then the problem would be that fighting someone of a lower rank would be a high-risk, low-reward situation.\n\nAdditionally, it's not really uncommon for a lower rank to take out a higher rank in a one-and-done situation. Green ranks play like fucking animals and so it's not uncommon for a red rank to be playing \"semi-good Tekken\" and to be taken aback by someone just throwing out random moves. Overly rewarding what amounts to dumb luck wouldn't be good.\n\nSo: you demonstrate your fitness for the next rank through consistent performance against your peers.",

You are unfamiliar with playing vs real opponents so the experience of doing that throws you out of your mojo.\n\nAnother thing you could do is write down 3 or more launchers that each have their own distinct combo.

If the opponent's moves are always beating yours, it's because your moves are always coming out later. That could be because they're in an advantageous position, it could be because they're doing quicker moves than you, it could be because you're hesitating, etc.\n\nIn regards to blocking, there are two ways to block and three main types of attacks: standing block will beat highs and mids but lose to lows, while crouching block will beat highs and lows but lose to mids. If you can never hit a blocking opponent, it's because you aren't doing the types of moves that beat their guard. If your blocking never works, it's because the opponent *is* doing the moves that beat your guard.",
            "It depends on the attitude you wish to take it. I'll share some stories of the 3 types of people who I met in locals who said similar things to yours and what happened when they kept their views up.\n\nThe first one is the Tekken enjoyer. He's an owner of a gaming lounge who got into Tekken when we held a tournament at their place and is a steve main. He never bothered learning the matchup nor learn the gimmicks but enjoyed Tekken the most as long as he get to b1. This is the mentally JDCR have ([see video](https://youtu.be/AWmPrlkTodo)) when he wants to have the most fun in Tekken. Just spamming electrics and hellsweep and then leaving when it no longer works.\n\nThe second is the tournament player. This guy was obsessed with finding the most optimal options, is a meta slave, practices a lot, and whatever practice he can do. He still has fun especially when he wins games but admits that labbing is one of the most tiring things in the game. He also gets hella salty when his mids gets crushed or when he gets caught by a gimmick but nevertheless, accepts it as part of the game and will lab his mistakes later on. If you are a competitor, you have to accept them as a part of the game. The best example I can give is Obama commentating on Shroud's attitude in the AT&T MK tournament ([see video](https://youtu.be/YkNwVQ6uTUE)). There is also Leffen trying out Tekken but takes the opposite route where he simply acknowledges the depth of the game but gives up on it because it is too time consuming.\n\nThe third is the scrub and is the most common and my favorite type of player in the offline setting. The scrub excretes salt whenever he gets hit with the same setup, move, gimmick multiple types yet refuses to lab nor ask what it is they can do to avoid it even when I'm right next to them. I still remember the time someone threw their controller when I hit them with the 5th LC calli roll and the reaction of the people around us. The solution for these people is to simply refuse or avoid these gimmicky characters or whatever you want to call them and convince themselves that it is the game that is at fault. Look at mainman (see clips [1](https://www.twitch.tv/themainmanswe/clip/ObliviousAlluringRaccoonFUNgineer?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time),[2](https://www.twitch.tv/themainmanswe/clip/TenaciousTangentialDragonflySuperVinlin?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time),[3](https://www.twitch.tv/themainmanswe/clip/DullCrispyStingrayMoreCowbell?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time)) and see how he copes with the things you're complaining about.\n\nThing is, many FG games we have today also have their fair share of bullshits and Tekken's recent iterations are evolving to combat this. In T7 we have punishment training, replay feature, recommended options, RA and powercrushes. In T8, universal getup options have been revamped and getting up is much more safer than it ever was.  Now I doubt you are a competitor so what I advice is to be an more of an enjoyer and focus on what you enjoy the most out of the game. Watch Diaphone's video on his 1 week Tekken challenge ([see video](https://youtu.be/UxpyxI2AeRU)). He first started as an enjoyer when he focused on his fundamentals, became a tournament player when he saw good progress, and then evolved into a scrub when he stopped seeing progress, got hard stuck at warrior-juggernaut rank, and kept saying how the game is just full of gimmicks (a type of \"its not me, its the game\" type of attitude). Later on, he changed his mindset by going back as an enjoyer by focusing on what he enjoyed the most which is his whiff punishing and then saw great progress as a result. With you playing more, you will no doubt run into many of the things you're complaining about but you'll also be familiar with them given enough time.",

            "You can't control whether you counter hit - your opponent has to attack you in order for it to work. The more aggressive your opponent is being at pressing buttons, the more opportunities you have to counter hit.\n\nSo, the most common way to get a counter hit is when your opponent attacks, you block, and your opponent immediately attacks again. Your opponent's second attack is generally at frame disadvantage, so if you block and then attack immediately you can counter hit. This happens a lot if you get good reads on aggressive players. \n\nOnly, the window to counter-hit is super small - you usually just a few frames to press the button, which isn't enough time to react and make a decision, you have to commit. Especially playing online I find that most of the time to get counter hits you have to buffer your attack and press the button while you are still blocking. Otherwise it won't come out fast enough.\n\nMaster Raven has an additional complication with this - she has a counter hit launcher with a quarter circle forward to start it. Quarter circles forward cannot be buffered - you have to input them when you're done blocking, which will take most people at least a few frames, which probably loses you your frame advantage and counter hit. This makes them very hard to use for conventional counter hits, especially online. \n\nIn other words, Master Raven's qcf1 counter hit launcher \"requires some execution.\"\n\nI'm not a Master Raven player but to practice counter hits I might try to use someone with an easy fast counter hit launcher like Steve or Miguel - just block and press b+1 immediately - you will counter hit if your opponent attacks a second time.\n\nAnd from there you get to mind games and stuff.",

            "If you feel that way then it is probably a good idea to play some matches.\n\nIf you haven't played at all yet then you should start playing some matches as you don't really understand the context of what you are labbing/watching and can't incorporate it properly without match experience.\n\nFor labbing I would focus on dealing with problems that you notice when you play and at the start like most games it is about stopping your opponent from getting away with stupid stuff. Most people at low level do things which gives high reward for low effort and don't really care about risk so you can either force them on defense where they panic mash/freeze depending on player and kill them for that or you can punish all their risky offense.

And also in other fighting games spamming the \"special moves\" your fighter has is part of what makes playing the characters more fun.

            "Hi! Been playing Tekken for over 20 years, 10 competitively.  \n\nThe biggest mistake I realized with new players is that they should try play multiple characters at once the moment they start; with a 60+ character roster, that won't help like you think it would.\n\nSure find a character you like first, but then stick with that character. Learn the basics of the game with the character and play a long time. What you what do is actually plateau in skill with one character,  then branch out to multiple,  by doing that you will actually surpass that plateau mechanically. \n\nI peaked with Kazuya first in T6 then went to Jin, but after peaking with Jin I had enough skill to basically pick up any other character (especially Mishimas), with a general mechanical understanding of certain movies and how to actually use them. So, when I actually went back to those characters,  I surpassed that plateau, understand?\n\n\nIf you pick a character, I would suggest a Mishima, especially Kazuya, he's rough and gritty, but he's a character who forces you to play the basics of the game, or otherwise he will not be played effectively. Also, since he has some semi-universal moves (I.e flash punch, God, Fist, Spinning Demon), you can break into other Mishimas easier.\n\nEdit: One more note, at the end of the day, practicing something in lab and pulling it off on an opponent is two entirely different things. Labing help go over certain situations, should they arrive. You will most definitely want to use it to build up the MUSCLE MEMORY, which is the most important part. Worrying about backdashing to the end of the ring might seem like the most viable thing to learn, but honestly your opponent can't hit you from that far to begin with. \n\nAlso, set up your sidesteps and side walks. Knowing your characters juggles--or every other characters for that matter-- is honestly maybe about 20% of the game and I'm being very generous with that percentage. The thing with juggles as the moment they get put into the air, hits immediately start damage scaling. The most damaging things you can do is perhaps a full string combo on someone's back or side without them ever leaving the ground.\n\nLearn your moves completely, and EVERY MOVE HAS A USE.\n\nIf I can lead you to one piece of advice that turned me into a pro, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SIDEWALK OR STEP. Just teach yourself to set certain things up, if you get hit or miss, not end of the world, but at least you set something up and failed and you have a CLEARER INDICATION AS TO WHY.\n\nI've learned more from my defeats then ever from my wins.\n\nHope this helps.",

Unless you're a pro or streamer, you're playing the game to have fun.  So do what's fun.  If you're not having fun playing Leroy, play someone else.\n\nIn my experience, sometimes taking a break from a character is what I needed and then I come back to them feeling refreshed and with renewed motivation to get good at them, because I've learned what I like about them by playing someone else.  And sometimes I just find another character I like better.  And sometimes I like both characters and I just want to play both characters and that's fine because I have fun that way.\n\nI'm maining Alisa, but sometimes I get frustrated playing Alisa.  Sometimes I'll play Zafina.  I like her and think she's cool, but I struggle with her, so I get frustrated if I play her too much but I have fun with her when I'm in the right mood.  Sometimes I'll also play Azucena.  I play Azucena when I'm tired of being defensive and poking and punishing (my normal preferred playstyle) and just want to play some dumb aggression.  And that's fun too.  \n\nThe other day I was getting really frustrated with Alisa, on the verge of a ranked promotion but then went on a big losing streak.  So I switched to Azucena and basically just spammed running 3,2 and simple LIB mixups for a while and actually ended up higher rank than I was on Alisa.

Some of the people you fight might be experienced Tekken players who are just starting in Tekken 8, or people who've played a bunch on other characters but are just starting to climb with an alt (if you see someone with a much higher Tekken Prowess than you, that usually means they're higher rank on antoher character).\n\nThe other thing is just that it's normal for people to have very lopsided skillsets in low ranks, and sometimes you'll end up against someone whose skills just line up in a way that they crush you.  Maybe someone just has a good offense that you don't know how to defend against, and their defensive skills suck but you never get the chance to find out because you're just getting crushed by their offense.  This is especially easy in Tekken 8, since it rewards aggression so heavily - the grey health mechanic can help getting comebacks from a bad start if you get a turn on offense, but the big damage can also mean you can loose extremely quickly if you don't manage to get a turn.  I've played plenty of one-sided matches against opponents where I knew our skill was close just because one of us managed to aggro the other down.",

That is the first step to solving the problem:\n\n> I absolutely collapse when my opponent runs their aggression on me\n\nThere's two ways I like to practice that\n\n- Going to replay mode, taking over at a spot where you didn't know what to do, and try different things until you figure out what works\n- Find someone who's an X main, where X is a character who ran you over recently, and then run a long set against them.

The first frame it becomes active on is the 13th, and it remains active for one additional frame after that (the 14th). This is *not* the case with her RD.\n\nThe former is the difference between the move's startup frames *once the input is complete*, and the fastest the move can actually come out in practice *taking the input into account*. Kazumi's RD is a f,f move, and those always have at least one extra startup frame from the input.\n\nThis is because f,f moves, like her ff+1+2, actually need to be input as f,n,f,f+1+2. The 1+2 has to be input at least one frame after the second forward. In neutral, this means there are an additional three frames from the input: one frame of forward, one frame of neutral, and another frame of forward *before* the move actually starts. But since the first forward and neutral can be buffered during recovery frames (like blockstun or the recovery of another move), in buffer scenarios that can be cut down to just one extra frame (for the second forward input).\n\nSo, Kazumi's RD always comes out 13 frames after you complete the input. But because of that input, it can never actually be faster than 14 frames. You can block punish a -14 move with it if you input it perfectly, but not a -13 move.

If you block his snake edge you should wait a bit and then do your launcher. \n\nAgainst Zafina know that she has the strongest back dash in Tekken, so do not whiff against her. She also has no standing i15 launcher, making Ali kick into mid a not so shitty option. Do not use highs against her, use mids that hit low to the ground, such as DF+1 and DF+2. Lows are good as well, FF n+2 is your friend.",
            "Get super comfortable with d/f+4, I think that's your most consistent option. Otherwise, d/f+1 hits pretty low as well.",
            "You'll often need to use invisible lows to open up your opponent. Lucky for you, you're playing two characters with an arguably top 10/5 low option. For Ganryu, d/f+3 and for Negan, d/b+4. Once they open up, you can start getting more aggressive with CH mids or +frame block options, but overall you're on the right track. Just make sure you're doing the incredibly strong lows, mentioned earlier, and not something overly risky.",
            "To be aggressive you have to understand what is the gameplan of your character and condition your opponent so that they play into it.\n\nNegan, for example, has really stupid mids. They're very good, they leave you at plus frames and this gives you time to pressure them. But as you may have noticed, only doing mids leads into nowhere, so if they're never crouching Negan has three good reasons to make them consider doing so, those being d+3 for a less risky option, d/b+4 for an intermediate risk and d/b+2 as a high risk high reward low.\n\nWhen you have used these lows a couple times they will start crouching or trying to crush them with hopkicks, that's why you don't spam lows, you just use them to make your opponent think about crouching and then go back to using your much more threatening and much safer mids. This is a basic example of conditioning them, which is what you should always be doing, adapt to what they do and condition them into doing what you want, which of course, is crouching.",

            "Most actions in Tekken need to play out completely before your character can act again. A small minority of actions, however, can be interrupted by other actions; this is what's called a \"cancel.\" Eliza has a relatively unique ability (shared only by Geese and Akuma) to cancel attacks into other attacks. You can find the attacks that do the cancelling under \"Special Move\", \"EX Special Move\" and \"Bloody Drive\" in Eliza's Move List. Attacks that can be cancelled from are left unlisted in-game but community resources, [like this one](http://geppopotamus.info/game/tekken7fr/eliza/data_en.htm#page_top), have done the work of finding them (in this particular case, they're marked with an orange \"c\").\n\nIn a match, you do these cancels by first inputting a cancellable attack, and then inputting a \"Special Move\", \"EX Special Move\" (you'll need one red bar to do these) or \"Bloody Drive\" (you'll need two red bars to do these) before the cancellable attack has completed. That's all there is to it.\n\nCancels matter for Eliza because they heavily augment the functionality and damage of her attacks. For example: her d3 low goes from a meek looking foot prod to a multi-faceted tool that can knock her opponent down, pin them to a wall, or start/expand her combos. d3's cancel is particularly important because she *severely* lacks ways to build a lead without it. This is what that guide meant by \"you either learn cancels or you don't bother playing the character.\"",
            "Geese's and Marduk's ground grabs are not the same. Some grabs are breakable just like regular throws (King, Marduk) and some are guaranteed (Geese). Depends on the specific grab.",
            "In certain situations the attempt is guaranteed (for example a wall combo)\n\nOther than geese, you can always attempt to break the grab (it's always either a 1 or 2 break)\n\nOther than that, they can't ground grab you if you get off the the ground. \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude09. But that's where mindgames take a role",
            "Oh okay! Appreciate the explanation \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Just to expand on this if anyone wants further context, ki-charging (pressing all four buttons at once) makes your next hit a counterhit, but you cannot block while the buff is active.  \n\nSome characters have setups with it that are legitimately nasty.  In Tekken 7 (need to check if it still works in 8), Xiaoyu can ki-charge after a knockdown near the wall and go for a d/b+3 when her opponent is about to stand.  d/b+3 is a very quick, safe low that does little damage, but on counterhit she can follow up with f+1+2, which leads to a combo against the wall.  It's a nasty little setup, can't do it every time but it will absolutely catch people slippin'.",

            "Yup, people assume that just because King has the best grabs, it's not worth grabbing him yourself.",
            ">  I think the trick is you need to know when to low block and learn your opponent's patterns.\n\nThis is literally nearly impossible unless you've been playing for years or unless they're super obvious with really slow lows, though. Some characters have insanely fast lows that open you up.\n\nI guess my point is \"just block\" is not very helpful advice in a game where you can get opened up extremely easy by tricky lows and one that rewards endless aggression. I'm TRYING to seriously get better at looking at my opponent and blocking more, but I almost always lose when I do that. However, when I mash? Even against better players, I win more rounds and more games. Not a good feeling at all.\n\n>  I've noticed that low blocking (and of course low parrying) is very very rewarding - either the opponent is super behind on frames when you block their low jab so you can punish OR you've ducked their high so you can launch with like a while standing 2.\n\nYes but this opens you up to mids, the most damaging moves in the game. In fact, I've won many games by simply conditioning with lows aggressively, then going into mid launchers when they expect another low. Almost no blocking or defense on my part.",
            "Pretty much this.\n\nYou are putting in the work, which is more than i can say,\n\nYou should give yourself some slack. Just because you are not seeing improvement doesn't mean you are not improving.\n\nKeep it up",
            "Huh, that also sounds like a good reminder that you don't have to memorize EVERY single combo. This greatly cuts down the filler which helps people like me alot lol",
            "That's something I'd definitely recommend practicing. At fewer minus frames it's hard, but punishing a -18 move with Electric should be pretty doable.",

            "This comment has brought me to something I would have missed in my lifetime, thank you",
            "Weird because SF females have been jacked since alpha",
            "So Asian players are the reason? Damn them",
            "And then Lidia became Nina clone lol",
            "The toned muscle mod for females shows otherwise. All the clothes fit as normal",
            "That sounds so cheap :/",
            "Wrong game, but I feel the same about Akuma. He used to be super buff but he had a thin waist and straight legs. His proportions made some sense. His waist was narrower than his shoulders\n\nModern Akuma in sf6 is a grotesque caricature of a pile of muscles. His waist is the same width as his shoulders. He is shaped like a barrel",
            "They did hwo so dirty \ud83d\ude14",
            "Well SF fans are horny for everyone",
            "in Japan men being too muscular \\*might\\* be viewed as homosexual\n\nwomen being too muscular is viewed as too masculine and not attractive",
            "Apart from Marisa, what SF females are jacked in sf6?",
            "There were a lot of people in the US complaining about the musculature of the women. I don\u2019t really see the problem since they\u2019re fighters, but they insisted that they look like men.",
            "Yeah by Asian beauty standard muscle mommy dummy consider unattractive and woman above 30s \n\nIt is pretty much Namco tradition by this point",
            "It's not that the women had muscle tone. Nina's shoudler were just too wide. Christie's too. You can't deny it was overly wide for a woman muscular or not. that was the main complaint. Kunimitsu and Zafina had toned physiques but not wide shoulders so they could have unique bodies without it.",
            "Because those mods are just textures and normal maps, not actual mesh. This doesn't change the fact that all the characters use the same base, with the exception of non-human characters of course.",
            "I didn't like the design of Akuma either. I thought I was the only one...",
            "lol, are Tekken fans above sexual desire or something?",
            "When thry say \"jacked\" they meant have defined muscles. Pretty much every female character in sf besides maybe Lily is one shape or form \"jacked\"",
            "Damn those insecure losers as well",
            "I mean, It does look like they used a male model, slapped some tits on, and a pretty woman\u2019s face and called it a day. Still hot but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Every single male fighter in Tekken also has unreasonably wide shoulders\n\nIf you stood next to Jin on the bus or train we would probably gawk at how roided up this guy is",
            "Well Tekken fans are gay and terrified of sexy women showing some skin \n\nJust look no further than this sub",
            "SF females are have no more defined muscles than your average real woman. The men on the other hand are comical",
            "Anyone who doesnt like what i like is insecure, right? Clown.",
            "I mean I\u2019m gay and I demand both men and women show more skin. Give us muscle dommy mommy\u2019s",
            "Gay dudes love seeing sexy women and celebrating them. This unnecessary change is on those dudes with fragile masculinity who can't handle anything but barbie dolls.",
            "I think youre missunderstanding what they meant really considering you defaulted to marisa immediately. They were more so talking about how you can still see defined muscles for the female characters of sf. Something you dont really get to see with most female characters in current tekken (atleast until Lydia imo). When they say \"jacked\" they dont really mean they want female characters to all be marisa level of definition",
            "No you moron, insecure men complaining about how muscular the women are in the game. That lead to the change for this game.",
            "The issue is complaining about it. Just don't play the video game character then, it's not like she's going to be your wife.",
            "That sounds bi",
            "Damn bro really knows contemporary society really teaching Chomsky a lesson",
            "Again, youre equating people not liking something that you like with being insecure. Imaginenshsming normal ass dudes for not liking muscular women with broad shoulders. If you like that shit. Cool, but dont disparage people who dont like it as insecure. Its a clown ass take.",
            "Ah so people voicing their opinion about the character designs is a problem now?\nIt just sounds like youre trying to shame people for not enjoying your fetish.",
            "Bi is gay",
            "You're insecurity is showing bro.",
            "That's you projecting. When every female character is already skinny, if you can't deal with a few being buff, that's just your mental problems.",
            "Maybe I gay then",
            "Isn't Bi a superset of Gay?",
            "Not at all.",
            "How is it me projecting when it is literally what you just said?"
