I assume the poor exchange rate could be temporary, and the NOK could bounce back, but that could take years, if ever?\n\nI've been thinking of looking for a financial advisor with specialist knowledge in this area, but I've no idea where to find one, and I assume that they'll take a hefty fee for their services.\n\nThe money I have in Norway is around 600-800k NOK, I also have a small amount of shares there.\n\nThanks. :)",

Be as precise as possible but you must still be aware that bonuses, overtime etc will knock the estimate and could cause the basic rate restriction to be changed and then cause under and overpayments.\n\nWhen PAYE was designed, it was when everyone had one job and that was usually for life.

He left me his clothing to choose what I wanted to keep and do what I want with the rest.

        "content": "Hi all. I wrote a post a couple of days ago about having a 3100 mortgage a month on a house we would buy for 720. Our monthly expenses come up to 6500 and our joint income is 8000. General consensus is that the mortgage is very high considering it is a 35 year term and taking that much out does make me worry. However if we live in the house for apptox 8 years of the 35 year term and sell it afterwards does this change the situation? I.e. we can just about afford it now but it comes with huge lifestyle sacrifices but I'm worried how this changes when we have children etc\n\nEdit: the other expenses are as follows \nTravel: \u00a3680\nBills: \u00a3500\nFood: \u00a3600\nCouncil Tax: \u00a3220\n\nThis doesn't include other outgoings, going out, gym fees, needing to upgrade car, house or life insurance and then any other income going into savings",

            "No one knows.\n\nIn 8 years you might be earning twice as much and interest rates might be back at 0.25%, which which case you'll be fine. Or your salaries might stagnate, interest rates could double, and you'll be completely screwed when you try and remortgage.\n\nHouse prices might have doubled, and you can sell and make a nice profit. Or we might be in a recession and you'll find yourself in negative equity.\n\nAnd having children will both significantly increase your costs, and mean that either one of you stops working or you need to pay someone else a lot of money to look after your children for you - neither of which you can really afford if you're that close to the wire.",
            "Can you clarify what your question is? I don't quite follow sorry.",
            "Need a better breakdown of the 3400 and a clear question. On the surface you\u2019re sailing close to the wind but you possibly aren\u2019t depending on the 3400.",
            "Your question doesn't seem any different from the previous one. No one knows what will happen in 8 years. The fact you're stressing about it probably means that 3100 is too high for you personally. Wouldn't bother me but everyone is different.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep with that size mortgage \ud83d\ude02 would be in constant fear of one of us loosing our job, you need a pretty big emergency fund in case the worst happens, probably 20k at least",
            "This is quite inefficient as you're paying a lot of interest on a high value mortgage up front.\n\n  \nAlso it's a lot of stamp duty to pay for a house that you'll scale back from going forward.\n\nPersonally I'd avoid. Take a lower value property and plan to move somewhere larger when you have children.",
            "I\u2019d look at the other \u00a33400 that\u2019s included in the monthly expenses.\nI\u2019m guessing leased cars/holidays/savings are a part of that?",
            "Is the house worth not having(or at least less) holidays, not replacing cars for an extra 3 years, less meals out?\n\nThose lifestyle adjustments would likely covers the difference.\n\nMortgages get relatively cheaper over time due to inflation. (With everything else being equal).\n\nBut as others have said the volatility is in income, house price, interest rates, kids, health, life itself.\n\nPersonally I've found a that being stretched for a few years is worth it. But I've not had a life crisis at the same time.\n\nMake an informed choice, just don't skimp on lifestyle adjustments and get into consumer debt.",
            "Two of you are spending \u00a3600 a month on food? \u00a3680 on travel? With a further \u00a3500 on other bills? Respectfully, that's an insane budget and you should be fixing this before buying neck end of 3/4 of a mil property.",
            "Calculation should look at few things.\n\n1. What is the cost of renting in the same area. And the what is that in relation to interest payments vs. Capital repayment. When you look through that lens, at least you are banking repayment, and interest should be covered if you need to rent the place out or if you move to interest only repayment temporarily (on that note check that kind of mortgage, as you can usually overpay but you have some comfort should things goes south. \n\n2. Earning potential vs interest hikes.\n\n3. Single salary income, what happens if you are without a salary for 6 months.\n\n4. Children are expensive especially in the first 3 years. \n\n5. Make sure the place can accommodate children. If they come along they start taking a lot of space.\n\n6. Feel confident in your decision not necessarily comfortable.",
            "Do you have or plan to have children? If you do, this budget will never work.",
            "I think you may actually be better off renting as you will mostly be paying the interest anyways. \n\nWhy not buy a cheaper house and pay it off in 8 years and then use it to buy another house? You don't even have kids. You do not need to make yourselves miserable! \n\nIt's just weird. Like people on lower income spending 1/3 salary on a car loan.",
            "3100 pcm for a mortgage on 8000 is ok if you have minimal expenses, what the fuck are you spending 3400 pcm on without a child? Anyway, in your position a 3100 pcm mortgage is totally unaffordable imo with 6500 committed spend, if you have a child you would go bankrupt pretty quickly.",
            "I don\u2019t really understand the question but in your situation I\u2019d just buy a cheaper house. You\u2019re engineering a stressful position for yourselves that may drag out for a decade.",

Although that\u2019s a huge budget so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s not your situation?\n\nIf the 6500 includes the 3100, then you have 1500 a month spare, and you\u2019ll probably be fine if you don\u2019t go crazy and spend it all\u2026\n\n8 years is a long time, even if it\u2019s a fraction of the 35 year mortgage, what is your plan if one of you loses your job, or can\u2019t work? You mention children, unless you have a great maternity / paternity pay package you\u2019ll be losing income, and need to spend money on the kids (Kids are expensive, really expensive).\n\nDon\u2019t have savings? Do you have a safety net? Could you buy a smaller house and upgrade when you need the bigger house?",
