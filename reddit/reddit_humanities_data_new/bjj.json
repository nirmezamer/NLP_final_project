            "Inside heel hooks are definitely the strongest, that's just fundamental leg structure. Maybe the switch because everyone's hyper aware of defending them?",
            "I can answer this pretty easily:\n\nCross ashi is a positional attack mostly, you use it to pin the opponent, sweep him if need and setup a pass or a back take. All of these work because the opponent NEEDS to hide his heel the best he can. Catching up the heel in cross ashi is quite hard on good guys (the very well known principle of \"hiding the heel in the same rotational direction they use to escape the entanglement).  We can use tricks to help with catching the heel (I am super partial to shoelace ashi mysef to slow down the rotational escape) but it's still hard. A good way to get the heel is to switch to 50/50 variations and another one, which has been brillantly used by Taylor Pearman at his trial (but also more or less Gordon himself against his nickrod ADCC finals) is to use the heel hiding movement from cross ashi to transfer the leg to the outside for an outside heelhook from inside ashi. From there you can break the leg but you can also, if you somehow miss, follow the rotation to land in outside ashi just like in a \"classical DDS reap exposure\". \n\nSo yeah the leglock meta is basically getting to cross ashi, transfert the leg to the outside and finish it there.",

            "That's not totally true.\n\nYou can put counter twist pressure with your legs from inside ashi too. It's harder and more subtle than in outside ashi but sometimes you don't need much strength to break the leg.\n\nYou should absolutely be prepared to transfert from inside ashi to outside ashi byt following the rotational escape though because sometimes you miss the break from inside ashi itself\n\nThe people who have trouble finishing inside ashi heelhooks have those because they are used to the bridge finish (which is not my favorite at all). People who are used to counter twisting mechanics pull it off well most of the time",
            "He didn't use cross ashi to finish it. By definition, there is no outside heel hook from cross ashi. He passes the leg across his body into inside ashi where the outside heel hook is available and finishes it from inside ashi position.",
            "This is very true, they\u2019re only boring if you get stuck deep and don\u2019t know how to escape and counter. Combining a turning escape with things like bolo or another attack on the opposite leg leads to great sequences both for spectators and for hobbyists.",

Sure I'll defend it the best I can, but overall I prefer not to roll with someone who's using them heavily in their game and if I happen to find myself in that situation I'll tap early \n\nHonestly, I don't know why all the downvotes. Perhaps the \"boring\" part came off condescending. What I really meant was that they are not interesting for me to learn.",

            "He admitted on JRE to spend hours every day harassing people who insulted him once years ago telling them to kill themselves and such. To be clear this is what he admitted to doing while going on the biggest podcast in the world to make himself look good. He dedicates like 8 hours a day to harassing people online by his own admission.\n\nI\u2019m very anti censorship but you can\u2019t possibly read this without thinking \u201choly shit what a fucking asshole.\u201d\n\n**Transcript from JRE MMA show 109:**\n\nLike sure, some things that I do, I, like first of all, I only attack guys who have started shit with me or started shit with my team or inadvertently or passive-aggressively. You talk shit about our team or myself. The problem is I just go way further than is necessary. They start at level two, and I just go to level 1,000 right away, and I just don't stop. They talk shit about me like 2015 and 2021, and I'm still just berating them every day. I just go way overboard and that's what people get upset about. But I never actually attack someone who hasn't started with me first. It's just funny, the dedication to shit talking. It's a full-time job. But now I can't even do it because Instagram just erases all my posts. Really? Yeah, Instagram, I just stopped pretty much using Instagram. I just post once a day or once every other day now.\n  But Instagram deletes. If I go on and I comment something and I attack a hater who attacked me and retaliate, 60% of my posts just get erased now. So I would spend hours a day on Instagram. It's like a full-time job. But now it's not even worth my time because I know that if I go on and I write, you know, 30 comments, 20 of them are going to get erased. So it's not even worth my time dealing with it anymore. What do you think is going on? You think someone's reporting them? I think it's a combination of people reporting it.\n  And I think it's just the algorithm is like, had been like, has a hit on me. And I think that like, like, as it shows you your violations, I have, like, hundreds of violations, like, 300 violations. Like, I tell people to kill themselves and stuff. So, like, now they just started threatening to delete my account, and they delete, like, all my comments. So it's not even worth going on and attacking people. Like, because normally it's fun for me to entertain the fans by attacking the haters. Yeah. But now it's just, like, Instagram just Instagram just erased like 60% of my shit.\n So it's not even worth attacking people because you spend six hours online and four hours and we're useless because all your comments just get erased. So even if you just have a post and they leave the post up, if you have comments under the post, they'll delete your comments? They'll delete my comments. Yeah. What? Yeah.\n  I didn't even know they did that. Yeah. Yeah. They delete comments all the time. Like people attack me, I retaliate and then then they start to, uh, and then we go back and forth, and then, like, the whole comment section gets erased. So you spend, like, four hours on a comment thread, and then the original comment gets erased, and then before you know it, like, you just spent four hours on Instagram, and it was all useless. What the fuck is wrong with them? It just, it just drives me nuts. I don't understand why they do it. And it just getting worse like it's not it's not getting any better so now I just got go on like once every once every day or so once every other day I just promote like a fight coming up or an instructional that's coming out and then I just I don't even bother arguing with people what about videos can you make videos like YouTube videos or or talking shit in the Instagram video will they delete that uh depends on depend i mean if people report it they pretty much just because i have so many strikes against me they pretty much just if someone reports it they just instantly delete it and they don't even give me a chance to fight it anymore they're just like yeah fuck you you had so many violations that they uh they just erase it but um i definitely i can do some stuff uh but it's it's getting the window of what i can work with is getting smaller and smaller by the day so it's just like i it's just it is one of the weirdest problems to have to be the best in the world at something and then have someone like instagram like deleting yeah comments and posts.\n\nI'm like perma-banned on Facebook. I get like 30 banned days, I'm okay for like two days, and then they just ban me for 30 days. They'll go back and they'll find shit from like 2015, like this goes against community standards, ban for 30 days, ban for 30 days, ban. I've been like, the last year I probably had like four active days on Facebook, and then I'm just banned for the next 30 days every single time. It's just like, I can't even use it anymore. How do you have time to do that though with all the training? So that's what I do for fun. Like most people watch TV. I just go on Instagram and I attack people. Like I get home. I eat my food. I'm like eating my food and I go on and I'm typing and I'm like \u2013 I tell Nat. I'm like, man, I just crushed this guy on Instagram. I can read the thread. She's like, yeah, it's going to get deleted. And then 30 minutes later, like, oh, this goes against hate speech. So it's just like I always used to do it for fun, but now it's not even fun because I just waste my time doing it. Now, obviously, the next course of progression for a guy like you would be MMA. Yeah.",
            "Yeah people are hating him because his different political opinions. Honestly that's crazy.",
            "That\u2019s what makes it even more impressive. His style is the very essence of bjj, that the most technically proficient person can defeat someone even stronger and more athletic. Listening to Craig Jones\u2019 recent podcast visits backs this up, he says Gordon isn\u2019t the most naturally gifted athlete, but he\u2019s the most technical, and the technical proficiency wins out. \n\nHe\u2019s not even a true heavyweight and he\u2019s beating people that outweigh and out muscle him with absolute ease and he almost always wins via submission. And not just via submission, submission that he calls out ahead of time. Literally winning any way he wants. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what matches you\u2019ve been watching but Gordon\u2019s are an absolute masterclass on positional dominance and finishing matches. I\u2019d rather watch that than a 2-2 guard pulling stall fest won on advantages.",

            "Having people in 2024 still refusing to accept how knowledge heavy leg locks are is something I really do not understand.\n\nAs you said, leglocks add a super cool layer of attacks, defenses and counter attacks to nogi.\n\nPeople don't remember or never were into grappling before heelhooks became a real thing... it was awful",

            "Well I have black belt in Judo. But also in BJJ, I guess I'll return mine? :D  It is true that I have background in striking as well and I do struggle sometimes with how far BJJ has moved away from fighting. I still enjoy the meta of the game when rolling, but not so much watching it.",
            "Just to make the point that disliking him is a pretty reasonable response considering how he behaves.",

            "The fuck? You don\u2019t dislike Putin? Hitler? They don\u2019t know who you are. Weird prerequisite to dislike someone."
