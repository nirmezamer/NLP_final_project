        "content": "##**>>THE SIDEBAR<<**\n---\n\n##**Troubleshooting**\n\n**If you CANNOT SEE ANY NSFW POSTS**\n\nChange your account settings to enable NSFW content [by clicking here.](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/) \n\nTick the 'I'm over 18 years old.....' box ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/qAPtyKeh.jpg)) and **SAVE** those settings.\n\n---\n\n##**When to upvote**\n\nIf the ***title of a post*** gives you a ***compelling choice, upvote!*** \n\nCompelling choice means that **one option encourages you to click and the other option discourage you from clicking**. Don't just upvote because you liked the actual outcome. \n\n---\n\n##**What is Original5050?**\n\nAn Original5050 post provides two possibilities in the title with only one actual result. Since you don't know which you'll get until you click the link, you have a 50/50 chance of getting one or the other. When the sub first started, this was the only way to make 5050 posts. You can submit an Original5050 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).\n\n##**What is True5050?**\n A True5050 post has two options in the title with two possible results. It will randomly pick and give users one of the two options. These posts are given a **[TRUE]** flair. Use [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) to create a True5050 post. \n\n**View Only True5050 Posts**\n\nIf you only want to browse True5050 posts, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiftyfifty/search?q=flair%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). This will filter out all Original5050 posts for you.\n\n**Submit a True5050 post** \n\nGo to [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) and enter both options there. The site will generate a link, which will randomly switch between both outcomes. Submit this link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).\n\n---\n\n##**Rules for Comments**\n\n**DO NOT** link the outcomes of any posts in the comments. Users that do so ***will be BANNED.*** This applies to True5050 and Original5050 posts. Asking for links/DMs is also banworthy. \n\n----\n\n##**Rules for Submissions**\n\n**I. Title Formatting**\n\n>Your title has to start with [50/50], have two clear options in your title (one must be good and one must be bad), and include either \"NSFL\", \"NSFW\" or \"SFW\". \n\n>Formatting example: [50/50] Bouncing boobies (NSFW) | Man Disembowelled in Pool (NSFL)\n\n>**One option should encourage people to click and the other option should discourage them from clicking.** If an option is just neutral or boring, the submission will be removed.\n\n\n\n **II. Only Use Approved Image Domains**\n\n>Post have to be hosted on [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Giphy](http://giphy.com), [Postimage](http://postimage.org), [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com), [Minus](http://minus.com), [YouTube](http://youtube.com), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), [Liveleak](http://liveleak.com), [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk), [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) or directly on /r/FiftyFifty. \n\n**III. No Illegal Content**\n\n>The following options are **NOT PERMITTED**, *even if it's only the made-up option*:\n\n>* Propaganda (Perpetrators are producing & sharing content to encourage their worldview like the Christchurch shooting video or ISIS executions)\n\n>* Content which authorities asked the public not to share (like the images of Bataclan after the terror attack) \n\n>* Rape or Molestation\n\n>* Child or Animal Porn\n\n>* Animal Cruelty\n\n>* Dead or Injured Children\n\n>* Depictions of Suicide / Intentional Self-Harm\n\n**IV. Descriptive & Clear Options**\n\n>If users click your link, they get either the first or the second option. Both options have to be descriptive & clear. \n\n>* **Descriptive:** It's not necessary to interpret your title. Before clicking the link, users know exactly what 2 options they can expect. Do not insert your opinions about the content in the title. \n\n>* **Clear:** It's not possible to confuse the 2 options. **Instantly** after clicking the link, it's clear which option the users got  - without relying on context (like video titles or 18+ warnings).\n\n**V. True5050 for Porn, Cute Animals & Spoilers**\n\n>The following options **MUST be in True5050 form** ([5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com)), *even if it's only the made-up option*:\n\n>* Porn (sexualized nudity, actions or body parts)\n>* Cute animals\n>* Spoilers \n\n**VI. Other Forbidden 50/50s**\n\n>* Memes or low effort posts\n>* [Self-Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (Instant perm ban)\n>* Fake or hacked nudes\n>* Trans, gay or male porn as bad option\n>* Loud noises / Jump scares\n>* Opinions (like naming a song a bad option just because you don't like it)\n>* Mentioning your connection (like \"My dog\")\n>* Villains as the Good Option (like Hitler)\n\n**VII. Moderator discretion**\n\n>Mods reserve the right to remove any offending post or comment *at their own discretion*. You may appeal any mod action taken against you, but you're not entitled to a response.\n\n----\n\nPS: This is an exact copy of the sidebar.

            "damn forgot about coldnessinmyheart.",
            "It\u2019s real. The \u2018wrinkles\u2019 that look like fabric creases are older SH scars.",
            "Looks like something on hellraiser",
            "that is not self harm that is self maiming, holy shit",
            "Holy shit, was not prepared to see that. I did not take the warning seriously enough",
            "That one was kinda crazy",
            "I remember first downloading tiktok around 2022 and seeing this account showing off different types of cut on legs.",
            "this looks like sfx makeup thing tbh i don\u2019t think it\u2019s for real\n\nedit : oh my god unfortunately it\u2019s real",
            "The skin is so fuckin pale Makin it look fake",
            "My little cutting board \ud83e\udd70",
            "Its fake right? Ni way tjats real",
            "\u0130s she posts on reddit or twitter (\u0131 foud the pic on google)",
            "From experience it\u2019s definitely real",
            "Unfortunately it\u2019s real. The girl was notorious for how she would post pictures of her cut legs and how deep the cuts were. In some pictures she cut so deep that the bone was exposed\u00a0",
            "I really do think they have a condition where you can\u2019t feel pain because how the actual fuck do you do something like this to your self without passing out from extreme pain or shock at least.",
            "I think she was posting on message boards like 10+ years ago.",
            "Is she still alive?",
            "shit I thought those were wrinkle marks from the skin shrinking but... are those scars?",
            "Exactly this could by classified as a torture method at this point. And they are able to do it over and over intentionally.... Its bizarre",
            "It actually doesn\u2019t hurt that much if the blade is sharp, just like a bad paper cut. \n\nUsually if you\u2019re this messed up there\u2019s also drug or alcohol abuse involved too which further numbs it.",
            "It depends on a lot of things but the physical pain isn't necessarily that severe. The shock however would absolutely be overwhelming to the point of causing serious nausea or unconsciousness for the vast majority of people. I really don't get it. These wounds would be crippling and take several months to heal. You would be able to do absolutely nothing constructive in that time. Trying to claim accident/injury compensation would most probably result in mental health sectioning or police involvement. If they aren't suicide attempts then this does absolutely nothing to alleviate any psychological pain that you might be going through. Would literally be healthier to shoot up heroin every day. I'm not trying to be judgemental but I truly don't understand it.",
            "If you didn't pass out from blood loss first.... Geez"
