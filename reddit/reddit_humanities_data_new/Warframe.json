Some of her Abilities apply **Judgments,** increasing enemy damage vulnerability by 50% for 10s. \n\n**Ability 1: Light\u2019s Judgment**\n\nCreate a well of light that heals allies and hurts enemies. Those who enter the well will be highlighted by Judgment.\n\nLight\u2019s Judgment is Jade\u2019s Railjack Kinesis ability. \n\n**Ability 2: Symphony of Mercy**\n\nCycle through three songs that strengthen allies.

Enemies cannot hurt your allies while wounded by Evensong\u2019s arrows. Kills with Evensong empower ally weapons with Multishot. \n\n**Unique Trait - Evensong Devotion**\n\nDamage dealt by Evensong's arrows applies 7 stacks of Puncture Status, which reduces the target's damage output by 100% and increases their Critical Chance of damage taken by 35%. Kills with Evensong activate Evensong Devotion, a buff that increases Multishot by 35% for allies.\n\n  \n\n\n**How to Acquire Evensong:**\n\nAcquire the Evensong Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg)\n\n**New Thrown Secondary: Cantare**\n\nIn moments of despair, let the battle resonate with song. Cantare\u2019s blades lodge into the battlefield and return upon reload. When returning blades strike enemies, Cantare empowers allies with increased Reload Speed. \n\n**Unique Trait - Cantare Chorale**\n\nCantare's blades have a 300% Critical Chance when they return upon reload. Strike enemies with returning blades to activate Cantare Chorale, a buff that increases Reload Speed by 20% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Cantare:**\n\nAcquire the Cantare Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg)\n\n**New Scythe Melee: Harmony**\n\nHarmony triumphs over hate. Heavy Attacks condense Status Effect damage into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills empower allies with increased Status Duration. \n\n**Unique Trait - Harmonic Resonance**\n\nHeavy Attacks condense all Status Effects that deal damage over time into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills activate Harmonic Resonance, a buff that increases Status Duration by 30% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Harmony:**\n\nAcquire the Harmony Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n**Jade\u2019s Ensemble Buff**\n\nWhen all three weapons are used together they have a unique buff! Evensong, Cantare, and Harmony sing together. Their buff effects are doubled.\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1979-jade-new-weapons-bugs/) on the new Weapons in the dedicated Feedback Subforum. \n\n[b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg)\n\n**NEW GAME MODE: ASCENSION**\n\nThe Stalker\u2019s stronghold is under intensive assault from marauding Corpus forces, but what they\u2019re after must remain safe. You\u2019ll need to initiate an emergency evacuation before embarking on a grueling ascent through enemy-infested elevator shafts to the Extraction waiting for you above.\n\nVisit the new **Brutus node on Uranus** after completing the Jade Shadows Quest to assist Ordis in gathering Vestigial Motes! This new non-endless mission unfurls in three stages:\n\n**Stage 1 - Mote Collection**\n\nThe Corpus have set up **Mote Collectors** to extract energy from the air - Ordis has taken them over, so you must defend them while they complete extraction!\n\n**Stage 2 - Ascension**\n\nOnce you have extracted the Motes, they must be transported in their **Extraction Capsule** top-side! To do so, power the elevator using **Ionic Capsules** dotted throughout the map, or dropped from enemies. As you approach them, they\u2019ll be marked with a small green waypoint! Keep your eyes peeled for extra-glowy **Boosted Ionic Capsules** that offer an additional power and speed boost. Once picked up, use the Alternative Fire to throw them at the Extraction Capsule to power your ascent!\n\n  \nPlayers can keep up with the ever-rising gameplay with increased jump height (thanks to a special Air Support deployed by Ordis), and via jump pads littered on various platforms. Should you take an unfortunate fall to the bottom of the map, use the jump pad at the bottom of the elevator to catch up to its height. \n\n**Bonus Objective:**\n\nAlong with the Ionic Capsules, players may come across **Sister Beacons** hidden throughout the map, identified by the soft pinging noise they emanate upon approach. Collect three of these to summon a Sister of Parvos, who will spawn once you reach the top of the Elevator shaft. Defeating the Sister will reward you with 5-7 Vestigial Motes and a chance at a new Arcane, listed below (8-10 Motes and a guaranteed Arcane on Steel Path). Sisters of Parvos will also drop Steel Essence in Steel Path Ascension missions.\n\n**Stage 3 - Extraction**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made it to the top, escort the Extraction Capsule safely to extraction and defend it from Corpus foes along the way! Should enemies manage to deplete the health of the Extraction Capsule, its progress will stop briefly and the health will regenerate, at which point it will continue on its path once more. \n\n**Rewards**\n\nSuccessfully completing an Ascension mission will award players with 11-13 Vestigial Motes (16-18 on Steel Path), as well as a reward from the mission drop table, including:\n\n  * Jade\u2019s Component Blueprints\n  * Endo\n  * Relics\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint \n\n\n\nFor a full overview of the Ascension Drop Tables, please review our[ Drop Tables site](https://www.warframe.com/droptables). \n\n**Releasing Vestigial Motes**\n\nVisit Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury during Operation: Belly of the Beast to exchange Vestigial Motes for various wares, including: \n\n  * Jade Main and Component Blueprints\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint\n  * New Arcanes (read on below to learn more!) \n\n\n\nOnce Operation: Belly of the Beast ends, Ordis will relocate to the Drifter Camp and offer his wares there. He finally got a job, yipee!\n\n**New Arcanes**\n\nEnhance your Arsenal with these new Arcanes! Acquire these new enhancements from Sisters of Parvos spawned in the new Ascension game mode, or exchange them for Vestigial Motes via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nStats below are shown at max rank. \n\n**Arcane Ice Storm (Warframe)**\n\nOn Enemy Frozen: Gain +2% Ability Strength and +2% Ability Duration for 15s. Stacks up to 20x.\n\n**Arcane Battery (Warframe)**\n\nGains 0.30 maximum Energy per Armor point, up to 1000 Energy. \n\n**Secondary Surge (Secondary)**\n\nOn Ability Cast: Next shot gains a Damage Multiplier for every 200 current Energy, up to x8. \n\n**Secondary Fortifier (Secondary)**\n\nGain 1 Overguard for every 100 Damage dealt to an enemy\u2019s Overguard. Deals x8 Extra Damage to Overguard.\n\n**Melee Afflictions (Melee)**\n\nEnemies affected by Status Effects gain 6 additional stacks when they're knocked down or flung by melee attacks.\n\n  \n\n\n**New Semi-Auto Fire Mods**\n\nThese new Mods can be equipped on Semi-Auto Fire weapons only, and prevent their firing speed from being modified once equipped. \n\nTarget Juno Sapper Moa enemies in Ascension missions to earn these Mods!\n\nYou can identify which weapons are eligible via the Arsenal if their Trigger type is \u201cSEMI\u201d. \n\n**Semi-Rifle Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Semi-Pistol Cannonade**\n\n+300% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Shotgun Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**New Status Damage Mods**\n\nThis mechanic was originally introduced with Dante, and we have dedicated a whole series of Dual-Stat Mods to it! Increasing your Status Damage stat increases the damage per tick for Statuses that do damage over time (specifically Slash, Heat, Electricity, Toxin, Blast, and Gas). \n\nEarn these Mods from new Juno Sapper Moa enemies found in Ascension missions!\n\n**Rifle Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+0.6 Punch Through\n\n**Melee Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed \n\n**Pistol Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Reload Speed\n\n**Shotgun Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage  \n+60% Magazine Capacity\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1981-ascension-game-mode-bugs/) on the new Ascension game mode in the dedicated linked Feedback \n\nSubforums. \n\n[7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg)\n\n**NEW EXIMUS UNIT: JADE LIGHT EXIMUS**\n\nIntroducing a new Eximus Type: Jade Light Eximus.\n\n  \nPlayers will find them in all missions where Eximus spawn, where they will face the threat of Jade Light on the battlefield.\n\nThese new foes will target up to 2 players, and will summon a beam of Jade Light that follows them and deals increasing damage the longer you are in contact with it. Players can either avoid the Jade Light until it dissipates (~8 seconds) or attempt to destroy the beam by shooting at the top of it \u2014 or kill the Eximus unit itself, of course. Once a Jade Light is summoned, the Eximus' Ability will go on a short cooldown before another can be cast.\n\n[b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x90](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/thumbnails/b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x900.png)\n\n**OPERATION: BELLY OF THE BEAST**\n\nJUNE 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET - JULY 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET\n\nParvos Granum is attempting to harvest Volatile Motes to make his own Jade Light Eximus army, and only you and Ordis stand in his way. With Ordis\u2019 help, you can commandeer the Mote Collectors and put an end to Parvos\u2019 plans. \n\nVenture to a secretive location (discovered in the Jade Shadows Quest) at **Brutus on Uranus** to preserve Jade\u2019s legacy! Fight against the Corpus to earn new and returning rewards from previous Operations.\n\n**What You Need To Know**\n\nOperation: Belly of the Beast requires you to step into this shrouded location - only those who have completed the **Jade Shadows Quest** are permitted to do so. \n\nAfter finishing the Jade Shadows Quest, players will have access to a new node on Uranus: Brutus. Here they can access the new Ascension game mode and access Operation-specific missions. Successfully foiling Parvos\u2019 efforts will reward you with special Volatile Motes, which can be exchanged for Operation rewards.\n\n**What You Need To Do**\n\nWhile Operation: Belly of the Beast is live, players will have access to special nodes that allow them to take on Parvo\u2019s forces. In these missions, all Eximus units you face will be empowered by Jade Light - meaning the only Eximus units that will spawn are Jade Light Eximus. You can help Ordis in his mission to stop Parvos in one of three ways:\n\n  * Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)\n  * Operation Alerts\n  * Stalker Joins the Fray\n\n\n\n**Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)**\n\nIn traditional Operation style, the new Brutus node on Uranus has its own Operation variant. Play Ascension as you know it, but with all Eximus units spawning in as Jade Light Eximus. On top of the regular Ascension rewards, each Operation mission will award players with 4-6 **Volatile Motes** (8-10 on Steel Path), which can be traded for rewards via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nSummoning a Sister of Parvos will also earn players an extra 1-3 Volatile Motes (2-4 on Steel Path), as well as her usual drops.\n\n  \n\n\n**Operation Alerts**\n\nIn addition to the Brutus node on Uranus, timed Operation Alerts will appear across the solar system that will also reward players with 10 Volatile Motes (15 on Steel Path). These non-Ascension missions will have normal gameplay, but will feature increased Eximus Spawns, and will only feature Jade Light type Eximus. Look for these time-limited Alerts appearing every half hour or so as an alternative method to earning Volatile Motes. \n\n**Stalker Joins the Fray**\n\nVisiting Ordis in the Larunda Relay not only allows you to earn Operation Rewards, but also lets you call on an old foe to assist in your efforts. In speaking to Ordis, selecting the \u201cA Shared Purpose?\u201d option will allow you to join another Squad\u2019s mission as Stalker. Doing so will reward you with the usual mission rewards, but at risk of losing them all should you be downed.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nNo Operation is complete without rewards, and Ordis has collected quite a few offerings for you to choose from. Ordis can be found in the Larunda Relay in the Navigation Room, where he will trade Volatile Motes for rewards.\n\n**Community Progress**\n\nBelly of the Beast comes with a Community Progress segment, tracking the total Volatile Motes collected by players.

Our goal is to reduce the friction necessary to engage in optimal play, so we\u2019ve:\n\na) Simplified the number of Health Types\n\nb) Redesigned how Faction Resistances work \n\nc) Increased the visibility of the new vulnerabilities in normal gameplay flow \n\nInstead of having 13 Health Types, we have simplified them into 4:  \n\n\n  * Health\n  * Armor\n  * Shields\n  * Overguard\n\n\n\nNow, these Health Types only serve to differentiate between Status Effects and Abilities that affect them, such as Magnetic hindering Shields, Corrosive stripping Armor, or Viral amplifying Health damage.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed the system so that Resistances and Vulnerabilities are **no longer tied to the previous Health Types**. Resistances and Vulnerabilities are now based upon the Faction a player is engaging with. \n\n**Star Chart \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d**\n\nVulnerabilities are now listed in The Star Chart mission nodes! Here, we aim to recommend the appropriate per-Faction Resistances, which will then universally affect that specific group.\n\n**The Star Chart** now shows Faction Resistances per node. Aligned with the present Faction, **Vulnerabilities and Resistances** will be listed to communicate the \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d options best used against any specific Faction or location.\n\n[66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg)\n\nSub-Factions will also have different Vulnerabilities and Resistances from their primary counterpart. The three main Sub-Factions are:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer\n  * Corpus Amalgam\n  * Deimos Infested\n\n\n\nViewing Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances now also depends on where the player is within Warframe\u2019s Story. The Factions (and Sub-Factions) will be unlocked via:\n\nFactions:\n\n  * Grineer: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Corpus: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Infested: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Orokin: Unlocked after **Phobos Junction.**\n  * Sentient: Unlocked after **The Second Dream Quest** completion.\n  * Narmer: Unlocked after **The New War Quest** completion.\n  * Zariman: Unlocked after **Angels of the Zariman Quest** completion.\n  * Murmur: Unlocked after **Whispers in the Walls** **Quest** completion.\n\n\n\nSub-Factions:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: Unlocked after **The War Within Ques** t completion.\n  * Corpus Amalgam: Unlocked after **Jupiter Junction.**\n  * Deimos Infested: Unlocked after **Heart of Deimos Quest** completion.\n\n\n\n**Simplified Faction Resistances**\n\nWith the removal of Resistances/Vulnerabilities being tied to Health Type, they will now be Faction-specific.\n\nDefault Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Grineer: Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n  * Corpus: Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Magnetic**\n  * Infested: Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Heat**\n\n\n\nFactions by Quest Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Orokin: \n    * Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Viral**\n    * Resistant**** to**Radiation**\n  * Sentient: \n    * Vulnerable to **Cold** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant**** to**Corrosive**\n  * Narmer:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Toxin**\n    * Resistant**** to**Magnetic**.\n  * Zariman: Vulnerable to **Void**\n  * The Murmur: \n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant to**Viral**\n      * Rogue Necramechs also fall under these Vulnerabilities and Resistances.\n\n\n\nSub-Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: \n    * Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n    * Resistant**** to**Heat**\n  * Corpus Amalgam:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Magnetic**\n    * Resistant**** to**Blast**\n  * Deimos Infested:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Blast** and**Gas**\n    * Resistant**** to**Viral**\n\n\n\nWith these Resistance and Vulnerability changes, we\u2019ve made a notable decision to make **Impact** deadlier towards the **Grineer** , while making **Puncture** deadlier towards the **Corpus**. This is a departure from the previous system, however, we believe that these two Statuses are more suited for these specific Factions.",

            ">We\u2019ve improved enemy spawn logic in Excavation missions to decrease the wait time between completing Excavators.\nThis addresses the player reported issue that it often would take far too long for enemies to spawn when moving from one Excavator to another.\n\nAFTER TEN THOUSAND YEARS I'M FREE",
            "Since**Impact Status Effects** enables **Mercy** actions, we found that it wasn\u2019t all too effective against **Corpus** due to their lower Health counts compared to their **Shields** , while **Mercy** killing **Grineer** is more accessible due to their innate tankiness. The **Corpus** can deliver incredibly high amounts of raw damage, allowing for **Puncture** to naturally play effectively into limiting their damage potential.\n\n**Armor Adjustments**\n\nImportant Note: We have not changed player Armor. This only applies to enemy Armor!\n\nEnemy Armor scaling in its previous current iteration meant that Armor Stripping was almost an all-or-nothing game, especially at higher levels. This resulted in players focusing on Armor Stripping as a way to tackle Grineer at higher difficulty content. Our goal is to reduce some of the extreme damage reduction offered by Armor at high levels, and make partial Armor Stripping more feasible. \n\nTo do so, we are making the following changes: \n\n  * Armor has a maximum cap of 2700 Armor (90% Damage Reduction).\n  * Armor has a minimum cap of 200 Armor.\n  * Steel Path no longer increases Armor values.\n  * Grineer enemies have increased Health scaling.\n  * Altered the formula for Armor Reduction to increase the effectiveness of Partial Armor Stripping.\n    * For reference, currently around 50% of Damage Resistance came from just 300 Armor, which is why complete Armor Strip felt so needed at higher levels.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, our goal was to make partial Armor Stripping a more valuable tool. By capping enemy Armor and adjusting how Armor is calculated, a partial Armor Strip will allow players to engage with high-level Grineer more easily - meaning max Corrosion stacks against an Armored enemy (reducing the Armor by 80%) will feel more impactful due to the new distribution of Damage Resistance from Armor values). \n\nFull Armor Strip is still valuable, but we wanted to even the playing field so players didn\u2019t feel forced to build around it.\n\n**Shield Adjustments**\n\nImportant note: We have not changed player Shields. This only applies to enemy Shields!\n\nThe Grineer are tankier by design, but the Corpus try to make the difference through their Shields. However, Corpus Effective Hit Points (EHP) are significantly lower, making them often trivial to deal with by comparison. Our goal is to reduce the discrepancy between Grineer and Corpus time-to-kill (TTK) by making Corpus Shields a bit more challenging and interesting to fight. \n\n**Changes to Enemy Shields** :\n\n  * Shields now scale more quickly starting at level 80. This means stronger Shields than before as players fight higher-leveled Shielded enemies. \n  * Shield Recharge Delay is now unified across all enemy types.\n  * Shield Recharge Delay now has a minimum and maximum length depending on how much damage has been dealt to enemy Shields.\n    * The more damage dealt, the slower enemy Shields will begin recharging, so if you can\u2019t outpace enemy Shields right away, you can chip their Recharge Delay down within a maximum and a minimum.\n      * For example, if enemy Shields break at any point, it automatically acts as if 200% damage (which becomes the maximum delay) has been inflicted on those Shields. However, if an enemy absorbs 99% damage (so 1% of their shields left), their accumulated damage taken now sets their Recharge Delay in the middle of their respective minimum and maximum delays. Should they Recharge and you deal another 99% damage to their Shields, they\u2019ll have absorbed 198% damage, taking them to the maximum Recharge delay of what that scaled enemy can have.\n  * Shield Recharge Rate scales with enemy level, recharging at a faster rate for higher-leveled enemies.\n    * Shield Recharge Rate will also accelerate while Shields are actively Recharging.\n      * Shield Recharge Acceleration Rate\u2019s base multiplier greatly increases after level 80, resulting in faster Recharge rates at higher levels.\n  * Steel Path Shields are now multiplied by 2.5x, in place of the previous 6.25x. Steel Path Shields were doubly-applying the multiplier unintentionally.\n\n\n\n**Effective Hit Points (EHP) Adjustments**\n\nEnemy stat scalings, such as Health and Shields, now grow faster as enemy level increases, in compensation of the loss in Enemy Armor and to make Shields more engaging to deal with. \n\n**Changes:**\n\n  * After Level 75-80, enemies receive increased stats, such as Health, at a slightly increased rate to prevent EHP stagnation.\n    * It\u2019s important to note that the increase in Health scaling is not meant to match the EHP values seen by previous levels of Armor. \n\n\n\n**Status Effect Reworks**\n\n**Blast**\n\nOur goal with Blast is to invoke an immediate and on-death effect to emphasize explosions. \n\nNow, instead of enemy inaccuracy, you **detonate** your enemies! When dealing a Blast Status Effect to an enemy, the following will happen:\n\n**Blast Changes:**\n\n  * Upon inflicting a Blast Status Effect, individual stacks will cause a mini-explosion, and a max stack count of 10 will inflict combined damage in a 5m radius\n    * After 1.5 seconds, an individually incurred Blast Status Effect deals a percentage of base-inflicted damage per stack-explosion and over 100% of base-inflicted damage for a full (10 stack) explosion.\n  * Status Duration will increase the delay before the Status Effect applies and depletes.\n  * Removed the previous Status Effect of inaccuracy.\n\n\n\n**Cold**\n\nWith Cold, we want to fully realize the fantasy of slowing, freezing and shattering your enemies. The existing Cold Status mechanic of slowing enemies is unchanged, but now has a new mechanic upon applying Max Stacks - freezing your foes!\n\n  \n\n\n**Cold Changes:**\n\n  * Cold now has a maximum cap of 10 stacks (was 9).\n  * Applying 10 Cold stacks to a foe will make them **Frozen** for 3 seconds. Frozen enemies cannot move, will not recharge Shields, and receive double Critical Damage. After the Frozen effect wears off, 3 Cold stacks will remain. \n    * Bosses, such as Alad V or Kela De Thaym, will be unable to be Frozen since they cannot accumulate 10 Cold stacks.\n\n\n\n**Gas**\n\nGas often lacked effective readability, making it difficult to distinguish its presence from the enemy or yourself. We\u2019ve introduced enhanced visuals so that when the Gas Status Effect is active, you\u2019ll be able to recognize it more clearly.\n\n**Gas Changes:**\n\n  * Added VFX on top of the target affected by a Gas Cloud to clearly show an effect is active.\n    * In addition to current and new VFX, Gas VFX now also more clearly shows the radius of the Gas Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect around a given target to better understand its impact on surrounding enemies.\n      * If a player is inside the radius of the Gas DoT, the visuals are reduced for them to maintain visibility, similar to Frost\u2019s Snow Globe. \n  * Gas VFX now has billowy volume to better present presence.\n  * Gas VFX now has additional floating particles around the smoke.\n\n\n\n**Magnetic**\n\nMagnetic has received a few buffs to increase its effectiveness against Shields and to hammer home the power fantasy of overloading enemy Shields.\n\n**Magnetic Changes:**\n\n  * Damage to Nullifier Bubbles has been increased\n    * Minimum Damage raised to 300 Damage per shot.\n    * Maximum Damage raised to 1200 Damage per shot.\n    * Additionally, we now show the minimum and maximum damage numbers against Nullifier Bubbles, with Magnetic attacks displaying the buffed damage shown above, while non-Magnetic sources will display the original, unbuffed damage.\n      * Known issue: Clients see the incorrectly unbuffed damage from Magnetic sources, which is strictly a UI/visual bug. Magnetic sources will continue to deal increased damage towards Nullifier Bubbles despite the incorrect numbers displayed. We will look to resolve this in a future Hotfix/Update. \n  * Reduced Shield Regeneration by a percentage per Magnetic stack against affected targets.\n  * Upon Shield/Overguard Breaking a target, the enemy will now be dealt Electric Status damage for a percentage of Max Shields/Overguard per Magnetic stack while also forcing an Electric Status Effect.\n  * Magnetic stacks on an enemy with Overguard now allow for bonus damage to Overguard, similar to how Magnetic affects Shields. \n\n\n\n**Warframe Changes**\n\nWith the above changes to Resistances and Status Effects, we took a look at Warframe abilities and made some adjustments to compliment the changes.  \n\n\n**Frost Rework**\n\nFrost, the definitively-themed Cold Warframe, has received a rework to better situate him for how Cold works with this Update! While Frost dealt icy attacks to his foes, the Freeze from his hit was not tied to Cold Status Effects. With the update to the Cold status, we have also amended his kit to properly use Cold Status Effects to Freeze enemies! \n\n**New passive - Fortifying Freeze:**\n\nCold Status Effects applied by Frost Abilities have their duration increased by 100%. Frost gains 50 Armor per enemy inflicted with Cold Status within 15m.\n\n**Freeze (1st Ability):**\n\n  * Adds required Cold stacks to freeze instead of simply freezing to both initial hit and AoE interactions.\n  * \u201cDuration\u201d is now known as \u201cFreeze Duration,\u201d indicating how long an affected target is Frozen.\n  * Doubled the baseline Area of Effect component of the projectiles.\n  * The Area-of-Effect aspect now scales with the Ability Range stat. The Area-of-Effect Radius is now present in the Ability description. \n\n\n\n**Ice Wave (2nd Ability):**\n\n  * \u201cDuration\u201d is now known as \u201cFreeze Duration,\u201d indicating how long an affected target is Frozen.\n  * **Ice Wave Impedance Augment Changes:**\n    * Leaves a frozen trail for 12s that adds a Cold Status Effect per second on enemies in contact with it.\n\n\n\n**Snow Globe (3rd Ability):**",

The damage increase (500%) from the previous hold charge is now applied to the now default tap cast. \n  * Its AOE now has a 100% guaranteed Heat Status Effect. \n    * Previously, it only had a 50% chance to apply this effect. \n  * Increased radius from 2m to 3m.\n    * Previously, its max range with fully charged cast was 2.4m. So we\u2019ve bumped it up to 3m for all casts. \n  * Added an \u201cImmolation Meter\u201d stat to inform of the amount of Heat Fireball generates for Immolation. \n\n\n\n**Immolation (2nd Ability):**\n\n  * Reduced the Energy Per Second cost when at max Heat from 10 to 4. \n    * We want to make it easier for players to maintain its Heat gauge at max. \n  * Added an \u201cImmolation Meter\u201d stat to inform of the amount of Heat that is passively generated by Immolation. \n\n\n\n**Fire Blast (3rd Ability):**\n\n  * Energy cost now scales based on the Immolation\u2019s Heat gauge\n    * 75 Energy (at lowest) all the way down to 25 (at max). \n  * Fireblast\u2019s Heat Damage and Armor reduction now affects bosses that are by default vulnerable to Armor stripping abilities (ex: Captain Vor), as well as Acolytes and Demolishers.\n    * Its knockdown effect will not affect those listed above that are CC immune. \n  * Improved hit detection so that enemies at varying heights in relation to you (above or below) are hit by Fire Blast. \n  * Added an \u201cImmolation Meter\u201d stat to inform of the decrease in Heat generation overtime. \n  * Added an \u201cImmolation Meter on Cast\u201d stat to inform of the % of Heat Fire Blast removed from Immolation when cast. \n  * **Augment Mod Changes:**\n    * **Healing Flame:** Now converts all over healing (gaining Health points while as max Health) into Overguard. \n      * Description now reads: \u201cEach enemy hit heals by 25 to 50 depending on current Immolation level. With Ember, over healing grants you Overguard.\u201d\n      * This only applies to Ember herself and not to Fire Blast on other Warframes via Helminth. \n    * **Purifying Flame:** Ember will now also benefit from the Status Effect cleansing and Status Immunity when hit by the ring of fire. ****\n\n\n\n**Inferno (4th Ability):**\n\n  * The Heat damage per second from ring of fire can now trigger Heat Status Effects. \n    * For a boost in its CC effect and to give it a more lasting effect on impacted enemies. \n  * Added an \u201cAngle\u201d stat to better inform of the on-screen LOS checks. \n  * Added an \u201cImmolation Meter\u201d stat to inform of the amount of Inferno generated for Immolation. \n\n\n\n**Other Ember Changes/Fixes:**\n\n  * Moved Ember\u2019s Passive icon from the Buffs Bar to be above the Immolation Gauge.  \n[5955ca67d49876d2f6c32bac782d5c67.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/5955ca67d49876d2f6c32bac782d5c67.png)\n  * Fixed recasting Ember\u2019s Fire Blast while another Fire Blast is active resulting in the original Fire Blast not armor stripping or interacting properly with the Healing Flame Augment.\n    * Also fixed recasting Fire Blast with a different Ability Strength than the original cast resulting in the first cast taking the Ability Strength of the second cast.\n  * Fixed Purifying Flame Blast UI Buff appearing to end earlier than expected. This was a UI-only issue and did not impact gameplay.\n  * Fixed Fireblast not showing its Altered stats in the Helminth screen. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**Gauss Thermal Sunder Changes**\n\nGauss\u2019 Thermal Sunder has been updated to properly reflect the mechanics of Cold, as he is one of the few Warframes capable of fully Freezing targets with Thermal Sunder!\n\n  * Tapping Thermal Sunder**during Redline** will now apply 10 Cold stacks - resulting in the same full Freeze. Its duration scales with the duration of his Ability.\n  * Tapping Thermal Sunder will add 9 Cold stacks on the second tap if it hits a target already affected by a Cold Status to reach full Freeze.\n\n\n\n**Atlas Petrify Changes**\n\nAtlas\u2019 Petrify interacts with Freezing and Resistance values. As such, he\u2019s received a few changes to clarify and enhance the mechanics of his ability.\n\n  * All enemies caught within the cone are now instantly turned to stone. Petrified enemies have their Damage type modifiers increased by +50% (does not scale with Mods).\n    * Added a \u201cDamage Vulnerability\u201d stat to Petrify to communicate this mechanic. \n    * Petrifying Frozen enemies will retain the Frozen Status Effect, but the petrification will override the enemy visually.\n\n\n\n**Baruuk Reactive Storm Changes**\n\nWe\u2019ve updated his \u201cSerene Storm\u201d Augment to properly adapt to the new Vulnerabilities, rather than the optimal Health Type as was before.\n\n  * Adjusted Baruuk\u2019s Reactive Storm to utilize the new Vulnerabilities system rather than the Health Type system - Reactive Storm will behave the same way it did before, but we\u2019re just ensuring it works properly with the new system!\n\n\n\n**Modular Companion Changes**\n\nModular Companions from Son are also now adjusted for the new Resistance system. Mutagens will be based upon Resistances instead of Health Types. \n\nPredasite  |  Vulpaphyla  |  Elemental Resistance  |  Physical Resistance   \n---|---|---|---  \nLeptosam  |  Adra  |  Heat  |  Puncture   \nChiten  |  Elsa  |  Electricity  |  Slash   \nArioli  |  Zarim  |  Cold  |  Impact   \nMonachod  |  Phijar  |  Toxin  |  Slash   \n  \n**Miscellaneous Changes**\n\n  * Codex Changes: \n    * Enemies now have their Resistances and Vulnerabilities more clearly labeled in their Codex entry by Faction. \n      * Previously, only the Damage Type icons were present and were labeled as green/red depending on whether it was a resistance or vulnerability. For a player who is unfamiliar with these icons, this was not entirely helpful. \n      * Now, these icons are partnered with their written name and are categorized under a Vulnerability/Resistance header. Additionally, combined elemental damage types have the damages that are used to create it in parentheses. \n    * Health values are now indicated in the Codex entry. \n  * Removed Armor Scaling from Eximus Units due to the Armor Cap implemented. \n    * With the cap, Armor Scaling is unreliable in increasing the difficulty of eliminating Eximus Units. To compensate, Eximus units have had their Health and Shield multipliers increased by 50%.\n  * Status Effects no longer inherit Energy Colors, so players can more easily identify when an enemy is affected by a Status Effect.\n  * Damage Resistances (from Mods such as Shock Absorbers) have been added as a secondary stat to the Armor Stat on-hover.\n    * Tau Resistance was already reflected on-hover for Armor Stats, now other damage resistances are given the same treatment. \n  * Tooltips for Status Effects in the Upgrade screen UI now include what they are \u201cEffective Against\u201d and its \u201cDamage Efficacy\u201d. \n  * Unified terminology for the following Status Effects throughout the game: \n    * \u201cBleed\u201d is now \u201cSlash Status Effect\u201d\n    * \u201cIgnite\u201d is now \u201cHeat Status Effect\u201d\n    * \u201cConfusion\u201d is now \u201cRadiation\u201d\n    * \u201cDisruption\u201d is now \u201cMagnetic\u201d\n    * \u201cCorrosion\u201d is now \u201cCorrosive\u201d \n      * These Status Effects have long been using the above terms interchangeably to describe the same thing. So, in an effort to prevent confusion when interacting with these, we\u2019ve updated all mentions to their proper term. We\u2019ve also fixed inconsistent capitalization of Status Effects throughout the game for consistency. \n  * Zealoid Prelate will now cleanse himself of Status Effects during invulnerable periods to prevent Cold Status Effects unnecessarily slowing the fight.\n\n\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1971-enemy-scaling-status-effect-rework-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1977-enemy-scaling-status-effect-rework-bugs/) on the Enemy Scaling & Status Effect Rework in the dedicated Subforums. \n\n**DUVIRI ADDITIONS & CHANGES**\n\n**New Decrees**\n\nSourced from our incredible Design Council, a new set of Decrees now have a chance to appear in Duviri to bolster your efforts to escape Dominus Thrax\u2019s vicious cycle. \n\nThe creative minds in the Design Council came back with more ideas than a Maw could eat up!

Maintain the laws of alchemical science in the Undercroft with the addition of the Alchemy mission type. \n\nLike most things in Duviri, completing an Alchemy Undercroft mission is different from how you know it outside of the Spiral. Here\u2019s what you can expect: \n\n  * Players must fill 2 Crucibles in order to complete an Undercroft mission or to move to the next stage in the Circuit. \n    * There is no Conversion Progress mixing stage in the Undercroft - players do not need to destroy Distressed Pipes while the Crucible mixes the elements. \n  * Dax Enemies will drop the required Amphors for the active Crucible, while other enemies will drop them at random. \n\n\n\n**General Alchemy Change (applies to Duviri and standard mode):**\n\n  * Slightly reduced the amount of Amphors required to fill up an element in the Crucible for Squads of 3 or 4 players.\n\n\n\n**Pathos Clamps Rewarded From Undercroft Portals**\n\nPathos Clamps are now rewarded from completing **Undercroft Portal side objectives**(story stage Undercroft portals do not reward Pathos Clamps) in the Duviri Experience! This is in addition to the current Decrees, Arcanes, and Steel Essence (if played on Steel Path difficulty) rewards. \n\nUndercroft Portals completed on standard difficulty have a guaranteed reward of 1 Pathos Clamp for completion, while those completed on Steel Path have a guaranteed reward of 3 Pathos Clamps. \n\n**NEW PLAYER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**\n\n**Debt-Bond Farming Changes**\n\nWe have revamped Solaris United Bounty Drop Tables to increase the amount of Debt-Bonds earned across the board. Our goal with these changes was to increase Debt-Bond drop rates, but not affect rare or desired items already in the Drop Tables. \n\n  * Moved Debt-Bonds from Stage 1 to Final Stage, but increased drop rate significantly for every Bounty Tier.\n    * Running the first Bounty Stage was a common practice to farm Debt-Bonds, and while we wanted to increase Debt-Bond drop chance, leaving them in that Stage would only incentivize that behavior further. \n    * With these in the Final Stage Drop Table, players who complete all the Bonus Objectives will have an extra kick at the Debt-Bond can, since the Bonus Objectives reward comes from this drop table. \n  * Increased existing Debt-Bond drop rates in Middle-Stage Drop Tables (Stages 2, 3, and 4, where applicable).\n  * Removed lackluster \u201cfiller\u201d items from the Uncommon and Rare reward tables: \n    * Level 5-15: 3,000 Credits\n    * Level 10-30: Tepa Nodules\n    * Level 20-40: 3,000 Credits\n    * Level 30-50: Tellurium\n    * Level 40-60 (including Narmer and Steel Path): 500 Kuva\n  * Replaced 10k Credits reward in Level 40-60 Bounties (including Narmer and Steel Path) with rare resources (Neurodes or Orokin Cells).\n  * Slightly adjusted Garuda Blueprints and Synth Mods drop rates to accommodate changes above, but we did our best to avoid increases or decreases over 5%. \n  * Reduced the Credit costs of Ticker\u2019s Debt Bonds by 50%. \n    * Previously, the cost would randomly roll between 5k - 350k Credits depending on the bundle offered. Now, it\u2019ll roll between 2.5k - 175k. \n\n\n\nFor a full overview of the Drop Table changes, please review our[ Drop Tables site](https://www.warframe.com/droptables). \n\n**Voidrig Acquisition Improvements**\n\n  * Players who haven\u2019t completed The War Within are now prevented from equipping the Necramech Summon to their Gear Wheel. \n  * Further amended the Voidrig Blueprint build requirements to require less investment in the Necralisk Syndicate, reduce overall farming time, and include resources that can be found in the regular Star Chart.\n    * Voidrig Casing Blueprint:\n      * Replaced 8 Stellated Necrathene (Rank 2) with 30 Faceted Tiametrite (Rank 0)\n      * Replaced 5 Cranial Foremount (Rank 4) with 140 Lucent Teroglobes\n    * Voidrig Engine Blueprint:\n      * Replaced 1 Biotic Filter with 4 Parasitic Tethermaw\n      * Replaced 6 Cabochon Embolos (Rank 3) with 10 Orokin Cells\n    * Voidrig Capsule Blueprint: \n      * Replaced 2 Scintillant (locked behind Master Rank 5) with 3 Morphics \n      * Reduced Spinal Core Section cost from 15 to 12, as players can get a maximum of 2 per fish\n    * Voidrig Weapon Pod Blueprint:\n      * Replaced 40 Thaumic Distillate (Rank 2) with 40 Purified Heciphron (Rank 1)\n      * Replaced 6 Trapezium Xenorhast (Rank 3) with 30 Purged Dagonic (Rank 0)\n  * Moved Damaged Necramech pieces from Necraloid\u2019s offerings in the Necralisk to Father.\n    * Players are given the Voidrig Blueprints upon completing the Heart of Deimos, but the majority of the acquisition path is hidden behind The War Within. While we initially added these items to Necraloid in Update 34: Abyss of Dagath, we found that players still had difficulty finding them, especially if they had not yet progressed in the Main Story Path. Moving them to Father is lore-consistent and should help reduce the grind further. \n\n\n\n**Awakening Quest Improvements**\n\n**Starter Warframe Color Customization**\n\nWe have added the ability to select one of three color presets (composed of the free colors in the Classic Palette) in the starter Warframe selection screen for Mag, Excalibur and Volt in the Awakening Quest. The selected colors remain during the Quest and afterwards until the player changes them from Arsenal. \n\n[aecc0d8aab66f1e476fcfe31135e36c3.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/aecc0d8aab66f1e476fcfe31135e36c3.jpg)\n\nYou can reset to the Warframe\u2019s default colors by hitting the \u201cX\u201d icon next to the color options. \n\n  \n\n\n**Awakening Quest Checkpoints**\n\nWe have added checkpoints to the Awakening Quest so players who leave part-way do not have to start from the beginning when they return. Players will be notified once they hit a Checkpoint, and will get a preview of the remaining checkpoints they need to complete to help them better understand their progress.\n\n[4e1e3fa392b4130b23ca433cf41d4d5f.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/4e1e3fa392b4130b23ca433cf41d4d5f.jpg)\n\n**Other New Player Experience Changes and Fixes:**\n\n  * Updated the TennoGuide path to include suggested Nodes in addition to Quests/Junctions up until the Mercury Junction.\n    * This change offers new Tenno the most optimized path to progress through Venus in their Main Story path. New player experience is a delicate balance of guiding players on what to do next, while maintaining player agency in their Warframe journey. \n  * Moved the Unda, Venus node (Spy mission) so that it is no longer required to complete to get to the Mercury Junction. \n    * Spy missions are a bit advanced for new players who are still learning the ins and outs of parkouring. So we\u2019ve moved Unda away from the main path and onto a branch of Venera so that it is optional to complete. \n    * The new path to the Junction is now E-Gate > Fortuna > Kiliken. \n    * Increased enemy level range of the Unda, Venus node from 4-6 to 6-8 now that it follows Venera (which has a 5-7 range). \n  * Replaced ammo drops from storage crates at the start of the Awakening Quest with resources, as players do not have weapons at the stage they appear. \n  * Updated the Bullet Jump tutorial text in the Awakening Quest to read \u201cHold\u201d instead of \u201cCrouch/Slide\u201d to better inform players on how to perform Bullet Jumps. \n  * Added a flashing icon that points players in the direction of Glass Shards in the Saya\u2019s Vigil Quest when using a Scanner. \n  * Removed the Mastery Rank requirement from Maroo\u2019s Bazaar. \n  * Reduced the difficulty of the enemies in the Corpus spy drone defense sequence in the \u201cTalk to Thursby in Fortuna\u201d stage of the Vox Solaris Quest. \n    * These enemies (notably the Terra Shockwave Moa and Terra Trencher) were rather dangerous for new players who may not be equipped to handle them, so we replaced them with more manageable enemy types. \n  * Fixed enemy pathing issues at the start of the Awakening Quest. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**UI ADDITIONS, CHANGES & MORE**\n\n**Loadout Customization From Navigation**\n\nYou can now change your Loadout directly from Navigation! Instead of running back and forth from the Arsenal when you need to make a change before jumping into a mission, you can now do so conveniently from the Navigation screen. \n\nMost actions you can accomplish in the Arsenal you can do here: \n\n**Change Loadout:** Selecting this option will bring up all of your available Loadout options to swap to. \n\n[f470520400bbf84e081c8e46064fad8e.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/f470520400bbf84e081c8e46064fad8e.jpg)\n\n**Warframe Options:**",

Config B now has the same Mods as Config A. \n  * Added a little indicator to show the Polarity of the Slot when a Mod with the wrong Polarity has been equipped onto it.\n    * Gone are the days where you\u2019d have to remove the Mod to see what Polarity is hiding behind it, you can now make informed Modding decisions without having to do so!  \n[341dc6416cae86849233b498245c8de5.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/341dc6416cae86849233b498245c8de5.jpg)\n  * Added a sound FX when equipping an Arcane Adapter to a slot in the Upgrade screen. \n\n\n\n**Stat UI Changes & Fixes**\n\nIn the Dante Unbound Update, we reworked the Warframe, Weapon, and Railjack Stats UI to reduce the sometimes overwhelming visual noise and instead put focus on just the most important information. With Jade Shadows, we continued those efforts by taking into account the player feedback and bug reports we received from the rework. \n\n**Changes:**\n\n  * Added a dynamic diamond icon next to stats that changes states depending on equipped Mods:\n    * This icon always appears next to \u201cCore Stats\u201d (visible at all times in the stat screen) that have Secondary Stats nested within them to indicate that hovering over it will show the tooltip. \n      * In an effort to clean up the screen, it wasn\u2019t obvious enough that Secondary Stats existed. While not as important as Core Stats, players should still be able to easily identify which of the Core Stats contain other relevant stats. \n    * Dynamic States: The following states are also reflected in the Secondary Stats tooltip to inform players that they are also affected. \n      * Increasing stat beyond the previous values will prompt a green arrow to appear above the diamond to communicate the increase.\n      * Decreasing stat below the base values will prompt a gray arrow to appear below the diamond to communicate the decrease. \n    * [2349a13690797166810c5cd59b781b9a.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/2349a13690797166810c5cd59b781b9a.jpg)\n\n\n\n  * The following is related to and was also listed above in the Resistances & Status Effects Rework section:\n    * Damage Resistances (from Mods such as Shock Absorbers) have been added as a secondary stat to the Armor Stat on-hover. (This is related to and listed above in the Resistances & Status Effects Rework section). \n      * Tau Resistance was already reflected on-hover for Armor Stats, now other damage resistances are given the same treatment. \n    * Tooltips for Status Effects in the Upgrade screen UI will now include what they are \u201cEffective Against\u201d and its \u201cDamage Efficacy\u201d. (This is related to and listed above in the Resistances & Status Effects Rework section). \n  * Conditional stats will now remain visible after unequipping the Mods that prompt them to appear so that players can see the comparison with/without the Mods. They will disappear after leaving and returning to the Upgrade screen. \n  * Shield Recharge rate is now displayed as a flat value instead of a percentage of total Shield value. \n    * Let\u2019s use Xaku\u2019s base stats as an example of how this stat will now appear in the UI (their stats have not changed, just how it is displayed):\n      * Before: \u201c9.6% per second\u201d\n      * After: \u201c31.5 per second\u201d\n  * Added a Damage Falloff Secondary Stat to the Melee Slam Attack Core Stat: \u201cDeal X% Damage to enemies on the edge of the impact zone.\u201d \n  * Moved \u201cReload Speed\u201d back as a Core Stat instead of nesting it within \u201cMagazine\u201d. \n  * Added a Void Damage tooltip in the Operator stats UI to show its efficacy stat and Status Effect description. \n    * Now reads: \u201cDamage Efficacy: X damage to Zariman.  \nStatus Effect: Highly effective against enemies with Overguard Health and Sentients as it resets their damage adaptation. Void creates a bullet attractor sphere on the target that attracts and concentrates further attacks.\u201d.\n  * Added an Overguard tooltip to Rage, Archwing, Necramech and Hunter Adrenaline Mods, due to their new interactions with Overguard as of Update [35.5.6](https://www.warframe.com/updates/pc/35-5-6). \n  * Reordered Charge Rate stat to the top of the list for Bow and Charge weapons, and renamed it to \u201cCharge Time\u201d. \n  * Changed Melee Follow Through stat to be represented as a percentage instead of decimals. \n  * Added measurement units to Weapon stats:\n    * Ex: Added \u201cs\u201d for seconds on the Melee Heavy Attack Wind-up stat and \u201cm\u201d for meters on the Weapon falloff stat. \n\n\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n  * Fixed Valence Bonus stat sometimes rounding up decimals when viewed in the Arsenal or when purchasing from Ergo Glast.\n  * Fixed Precision Intensify not properly displaying Ability Strength stat increases for the following Exalted Abilities in the Arsenal: \n    * Excalibur\u2019s Exalted Blade\n    * Baruuk\u2019s Serene Storm\n    * Titania\u2019s Razorwing\n    * Valkyr\u2019s Hysteria\n    * Ivara\u2019s Artemis Bow\n    * Mesa\u2019s Peacemaker \n    * Sevagoth\u2019s Exalted Shadow\n    * Wukong\u2019s Primal Fury\n  * Fixed Chat Linking unowned equipment (Warframes, Weapons, etc.) resulting in fewer stats being listed than if they were owned.\n  * Fixed certain Incarnon Weapon stats showing as \u201c0\u201d and the UI showing a comparison state as if Mods had been equipped, when in fact they had not yet. \n  * Fixed the Wind Up stat increasing in UI instead of decreasing when Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed Mods are equipped. \n  * Fixed the Chilling Reload Mod\u2019s Reload Speed stat going red instead of green when increasing its rank. \n  * Fixed Paris Prime\u2019s Status stat tooltip not showing a breakdown of \u201cchance for each Status Effect type per hit.\u201d\n  * Fixed stats not updating in the UI while modding Companions in a Relay/Town/Dojo/etc. \n  * Fixed repeatedly hovering over Praedos\u2019 \u201cDrifting Grace\u201d Incarnon Evolution incorrectly increasing a Warframe\u2019s Sprint Speed stat in the Arsenal UI.\n  * Fixed the following Warframe Aura Mods not affecting the Ammo from Pickups stat in the Arsenal UI: \n    * Rifle Scavenger\n    * Pistol Scavenger\n    * Shotgun Scavenger\n    * Sniper Scavenger\n  * Fixed the Critical Multiplier from Braton Incarnon\u2019s \u201cPrelude of Might\u201d perk not being indicated in the Arsenal stats (this was strictly a UI issue, the stats increase was applying).\n  * Fixed Ruvox Incarnon\u2019s Damage stat not updating from Impact to Puncture when transformed to Incarnon Mode in the Arsenal stats. \n\n\n\n**HUD Changes**\n\n**Improved HUD Scaling**\n\nWe\u2019ve changed the HUD Scale option so that the HUD now scales proportionally to the player's game resolution!",

            "There is ONE use of them, which is expedite suffering builds for disruption. Very, VERY niche, but still there nonetheless. And who knows, maybe they have some other niches. It\u2019s better for them just to add new mods anyways just so that no meme build gets left behind.",

In other words, it *isn't* a choice, and therefore isn't a good game mechanic. \n\n  \nAny time that a game offers a \"choice\" but there is only one \"correct\" option means it's not actually a choice and it's poor design.

            "Previously, the HUD was what we call \u201cFixed size\u201d, where the HUD elements were of a predetermined size that did not automatically scale to accommodate different resolutions. Players who used the game resolution 1280x720px (the \u201cFixed Size\u201d resolution) would see the HUD at the initial 100% size we made it for.\n\nHowever, if players set their game resolution to 1920x1080px, the HUD would then be 66.6% of the size we initially made it for. This led to players having to manually change the HUD Scale in the settings.\n\nNow, we have changed the HUD to scale proportionally. The HUD Scale is now based on the player\u2019s game resolution, and with that the HUD Scale 100 proportionally looks the same at every resolution.\n\n[3c33805115d868c6646070238751f550.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/3c33805115d868c6646070238751f550.jpg)\n\n[12ddcec1b32f49461985893b6c9948df.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/12ddcec1b32f49461985893b6c9948df.jpg)\n\nMaking the game resolution wider does not continue to increase the size of the HUD. The HUD Scale is now going off whichever measurement (horizontal or vertical) is lower than 16:9, and with that, it will use the smallest axis as its anchor.\n\nPreviously, the HUD Scale option ranged from 1x to 3x (Scale 100 - 300). Now, we have changed it to 0.5x to 2x (Scale 50 - 200).\n\n**Please note** : With Jade Shadows, we have set the player's HUD Scale option to 100(%) so that players don\u2019t get blasted with a super-sized UI. To make adjustments, go to Options > Interface > HUD.\n\n**The following numbers show the overall HUD Scale difference from before vs. now:**\n\nSome expected numbers based on the aspect math at 100 HUD scale:\n\n  * Old 720p - 100 scale = New 720p - 125 scale\n  * Old 1080p - 100 scale = New 1080p - 80 scale\n  * Old 1440p - 100 scale = New ~63 scale\n  * Old 4k - 100 scale = New ~42 scale, so no longer available\n\n\n\nOther way around at new default HUD scales, should be equivalent to:\n\n  * 720p: 80\n  * 900p: 100\n  * 1080p: 120\n  * 1440p: 160\n  * 4k: 240\n\n\n\n**HUD Mod Pop-Ups**\n\nPreviously, any Mod that you acquired as a drop mid-mission would take up a considerable chunk of your screen, no matter the Mod. So we\u2019ve made HUD changes to minimize the impact of these Mods: \n\n  * Mods that you already own will now appear minimized at the bottom-center of your screen (like Resources), while new or Rare Mods will appear as they have previously.\n  * Common Mods will appear at the bottom of your screen with a Bronze tag and a singular diamond, and Uncommon Mods will appear as a silver tag with two diamonds. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**General UI Changes & Fixes**\n\n  * Damage Numbers have received an overhaul to make it easier to see while damaging an enemy. Damage number \u201cflyoffs\u201d (the way the numbers appear and move off of damaged enemies) will now \u201cfly\u201d further based on distance from target, to ensure you can aim to hit the target easily without numbers blocking your view.

With both status damage *and* status duration though, I guess that'd be a net buff, but I can't imagine many builds being able to fit all of that.\n\nThe only real difference between the two is that status duration also extends the length of CC-like effects like cold or radiation, or I guess the damage amp effects of corrosive or viral.",

For reassurance, the upgrades themselves have not changed, only their descriptions. \n    * For example, Incarnons which previously contained the phrase \u201cIncrease Critical Chance by |VALUE|%\u201d now read \u201cIncrease **Base** Critical Chance by |VALUE|%.\n  * The Magistar Incarnon\u2019s Evolution II Perk \u2018Crushing Verdict\u2019 has been changed from multiplicative follow-through to base follow-through. This means that the value also changed from +100% to +40% to maintain the same effect. Players should not notice a functional change.\n  * The Nami Solo Incarnon\u2019s Evolution II Perk \u2018Master\u2019s Flourish\u2019 has had its text corrected.

For example, a Heat icon will now properly display with any mention of \u201cHeat Damage.\u201d\n  * Unowned Captura Scenes are now indicated by an \u201ceye\u201d icon instead of a \u201cLocked\u201d tag. \n  * Changed the \u201cEquip\u201d button in the Arsenal to say \u201cSwap\u201d. \n  * Changed confirmation button from \u201cGive\u201d to \u201cConfirm\u201d in Bird 3\u2019s Shiny Treasures screen. \n  * Added a subtle on-hover glow to Decrees to make it clearer which one is being selected. \n  * Updated Inbox sender icons to have consistent backgrounds. \n  * Added a \u201cLast Equipped\u201d label to the last-equipped Relic in an endless Void Fissure mission. Relics with this label will always appear at the top of the Relic selection screen in-mission. \n  * The Void Fissure tab in the Navigation Screen will now appear if you have previously owned a Void Relic, even if you don\u2019t currently have any in your inventory. \n    * Previously it would only appear if you owned Void Relics (and had the Void Relic Segment installed in your Orbiter). \n  * Updated the damage type icons to their colored versions to improve visibility in the following UI areas (not exhaustive):\n    * Arsenal Stats\n    * Simulacrum\u2019s enemy tooltips \n    * Lavos\u2019 HUD\n    * Alchemy mission HUD (including icons over Amphors) \n    * And more! \n  * Fixed Syndicates with negative reputation saying they are ready to Rank Up when they are at the max amount of negative Standing instead of the minimum. \n  * Fixed being unable to scroll through the list of Warframes in the \u201cInvert Tap/Hold Abilities\u201d setting. \n  * Fixed the \u201cInvert Tap/Hold Abilities\u201d menu opening up blank. \n  * Fixed \u201cHow To\u201d option appearing on locked Nightwave Acts.\n    * Players will gain access to the \u201cHow To\u201d pop-up once they have completed the Nightwave Act\u2019s prerequisites to avoid spoilers.\n  * Fixed issues when swapping from a PlayStation controller to a keyboard to type in a text box.\n  * Fixed the tutorial button missing in the Arsenal when using a controller.\n  * Fixed the Cedo Daybreak Skin displaying the \"This is a cosmetic for Cedo, which you do not own.\" regardless of Cedo ownership message on-hover in the \u201cTune in to Nora's Mix Vol. 6\u201d preview screen.\n  * Fixed Attachments Appearance Menu for Railjack Crew not allowing players to customize energy tint. \n  * Fixed Necraloid showing up in the Sanctum Anatomica Fast Travel menu for players who are not Rank 5 in the Cavia Syndicate. \n  * Fixed Open Squads always appearing as 0 regardless of actual Open Squad count when selecting missions from the Chrysalith Elevator. \n  * Fixed interacting with a Terminal while a Glaive and Incarnon Form Pistol are dual-wielded resulting in only the Incarnon Form reticle being used. Now it should properly swap between Dual-Wield and Incarnon reticles depending on aim state. \n  * Fixed simultaneous inputs for Transference, opening the pause menu, and opening chat resulting in the Menu screen being aligned to the Warframe instead of the Operator/Drifter.\n  * Fixed opening Decree Menu simultaneously with another context action in Duviri (ex: playing Komi) resulting in the Decree Menu overlapping the screen. \n  * Fixed Circuit \u201cReward Ready to Claim\u201d indicator appearing on top of other UI elements in the Navigation menu. \n  * Fixed the Mod pick-up pop-up overlapping with the Squad panel in-mission. \n  * Fixed the Dual Wield (Glaive + Pistol) reticle not being affected by HUD scale settings. \n  * Fixed Friends list not displaying the correct enemy level and faction (Grineer instead of Murmur) for friends in a Deep Archimedea mission. \n  * Fixed Clients seeing the Incarnon Evolution challenge UI popping up in Duviri for unowned Incarnon Weapons (players cannot evolve these weapons as they do not own them, so the popup was misleading). \n  * Fixed the Squad Equipment menu at times not appearing in Relays, Towns, Maroo\u2019s Bazaar, etc. \n  * Fixed Ash\u2019s Smoke Shadow Augment missing its HUD buff indicator. \n  * Fixed Conservation markers at times not showing the closest target after completing a Capture. \n  * Fixed the Earth Razorback Armada node overlapping with the Orbiter in the Star Chart. \n  * Fixed chat window sometimes moving after joining a mission as Client. \n  * Fixed various controller-specific UI elements in the Upgrade Screen. \n  * Fixed Region Chat\u2019s history not properly updating when returning to the Orbiter. \n  * Fixed reloading reticle remaining on the screen if Voruna\u2019s Ulfrun\u2019s Descent is cast mid-reload. \n  * Fixed cursor being able to leave the Game Window when interacting with the \u201cReview Logs\u201d terminal in the Sanctum Anatomica.\n  * Fixed \u201cReactant Collected\u201d UI tracker lingering in HUD after completing Void Storm and Omni Fissure missions. \n  * Fixed the ability icons overlapping with the stat box in the Arsenal UI. \n  * Fixed Index Mission Progress screen having broken UI elements. \n  * Fixed the Valac Europa node\u2019s Crossfire Faction saying \u201cGrineer VS. Corpus\u201d instead of the intended \u201cCorpus VS. Infested\u201d. \n  * Fixed \u201cMission Failed\u201d End of Mission screen showing again after exiting Arsenal if they had just returned from aborting/failing a mission. \n  * Fixed Infested Salvage Alerts not informing players how many rounds they have to complete in the UI. \n  * Fixed an issue where the mission results screen wouldn\u2019t open while in the Orbiter when activating the \u201cView Mission Progress\u201d input.\n  * Fixed an issue where Melee weapon Unique Trait text would become unreadable in the Arsenal Upgrade screen due to the text overlapping while a Stance Mod is equipped.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n**FINISHER CHANGES**\n\n**Unified Finisher Mechanics**\n\nBefore explaining the changes, let\u2019s define a few terms and basic concepts about Finishers:\n\n  * **Mercy Kills:** Available on specialty enemies when they reach certain health thresholds.\n  * **Finishers:** Available when a move \u201copens enemies to finishers\u201d.\n  * **Ground Finishers:** Available after certain effects which knock enemies down. \n\n\n\nAll of the above count as Finishers for relevant Mods, Arcanes, Abilities, etc. Mercy Kills differ slightly as they are specific to your Parazon upgrades which do not apply to other Finishers.\n\n  \nIn order to make utilizing finishers easier, we have updated how they function to unify their mechanics: \n\n  * Increased the Finisher context action distance for Finishers from in front or behind from 2m to 3m.\n  * Ground finishers are now performed via context action instead of automatically via Melee Attack input. This should allow players to execute Ground Finishers much more reliably.\n    * The \u201cGround Finisher\u201d context action will appear on enemies in range who are open to Ground Finishers.  \n[b71a32796499087a93b6b863f219ecec.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/b71a32796499087a93b6b863f219ecec.jpg)\n  * Updated the Mercy Kill context action with unique visuals to clearly distinguish between Mercy Kills and Finishers.  \n[bc44797143af5c4df805c02c25aec63a.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/bc44797143af5c4df805c02c25aec63a.jpg)\n  * Updated the overhead icon displayed on enemies open to non-Mercy Finishers.\n\n\n\n**Enemy Size Scaling**\n\nWe\u2019ve taken strides in reducing how we scale enemies whenever a Finisher is used against them!\n\nBy default, Finishers cause enemies larger than your Warframe (ex: Grineer Bombard and Corrupted Gunners). This had the risk of causing some strange visual issues on the enemies that weren't ideal. \n\nWe\u2019ve audited the contact points between the player and the enemy with all Melee Weapon animations to resolve these graphical sizing mishaps! \n\nWhat this looks like is:",
            "I tested the shotgun version of this mod with Wisp and can confirm that this mod blocks the fire rate increase.",
            "* If a point of contact is present between the player character and an enemy, such as a chokehold or grabbing a limb, enemy scaling will persist.\n  * If there is no physical point of contact between the player character and an enemy, the enemy scaling doesn\u2019t occur as it isn\u2019t necessary!\n\n\n\n**Scaling Fixes:**\n\n  * Fixed an issue where Finishers on Corpus Crewman and Grineer Lancers would stretch their spines. Like an untrained chiropractor. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**NEW VIDEO SETTING: REDUCE FRAME LATENCY**\n\nWe have added a new Video setting: Reduce Frame Latency!\n\n[12f5539aa59ac7be3347950aacab3ea1.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/12f5539aa59ac7be3347950aacab3ea1.png)\n\nThis option can reduce the time between when you act (eg: fire your weapon) and when you see it on-screen (muzzle-flash, tracer etc) and should make the game feel more responsive.\n\nSurprisingly, this option actually needs **less** VRAM than normal, particularly for high-resolution (4K), ultra-wide, or HDR displays; having more memory VRAM free can reduce texture streaming pops and improve performance by keeping more textures in cache which might compound the effect of making the game feel more responsive.\n\nIf you are using a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) display with a technology like Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync, or you have disabled Vertical Sync (VSync), there should be no drawback at all to using this option.\n\nYou may find, however, for fixed refresh-rate displays, particularly at lower frame-rates, that this option might make the game feel less cinematic: your average frame-rate should be the same but some frames might arrive sooner or later and slow camera movements might feel less smooth.\n\nOur hope is that, given Warframe\u2019s typical fast-paced movement, none of the drawbacks will be obvious and the improved responsiveness will enhance your sense of immersion.\n\n**While it is currently disabled by default we would encourage everyone to try enabling it so we can gather feedback to decide what the best default should be.**\n\n**Note:** The setting will not take effect until you restart the game.\n\nWhile we have exposed the option for DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 on PC we have not exposed it for other platforms yet (it has been tested on some though, notably Nintendo Switch, where the VRAM savings are very tempting).\n\nPlease let us know how it feels to you (please include your system specs so we can make sure we get feedback from a wide range of systems). Hopefully with your help we can decide if it makes sense to enable it by default.

The Citadel room remains untradeable as it is the default, as well as the Ballroom as it is an event-specific reward. \n\n**General Additions**\n\n  * Added the **Cavia Arcane Collection** to Loid\u2019s \u201cArcane Dissolution\u201d Offerings - this Collection has a chance at the following Arcanes:\n    * Melee Fortification \n    * Melee Retaliation \n    * Melee Animosity \n    * Melee Exposure \n    * Melee Influence\n    * Melee Vortex\n    * Melee Crescendo \n    * Melee Duplicate \n  * Added Fast Travel to the Gear Wheel in the following areas:\n    * Dormizone\n      * Duviri, Arsenal, Operator, Drifter Intrinsics, Acrithis, Somachord, and Decorate Dormizone\n    * Maroo\u2019s Bazaar\n      * Set Up Shop, Arsenal, Maroo, Varzia, and True Master\u2019s Font (for MR 30+ Tenno) \n    * Cetus\n      * Konzu, Arsenal, Hok, Fisher Hai-Luk, Old Man Suumbaat, Nakak, Master Teasonai, Quill Onkko, and Mission Entrance \n    * Fortuna\n      * Eudico, Arsenal, Rude Zuud, The Business, Smokefinger, Ticker, Legs, Roky, Little Duck, Briefing, and Mission Entrance \n      * [2638924339ca4cd1215b79882ca35de4.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/2638924339ca4cd1215b79882ca35de4.jpg)\n    * Necralisk\n      * Mother, Arsenal, Father, Son, Daughter, Grandmother, Otak, Loid, and Mission Entrance\n    * Chrysalith\n      * Quinn, Hombask, Cavalero, Archimedean Yonta, Arsenal, and Zariman Navigation\n    * Sanctum Anatomica\n      * Fibonacci, Tagfer, Bird 3, Loid, Necraloid, Arsenal, and Mission Entrance\n  * Added a \u201cWeapons Enabled\u201d Toggle in Captura Settings to specifically enable/disable Operator Amps. \n    * Note: This setting is re-enabled after switching back to Warframe from Operator. \n  * Added a separate \u201cSwap Weapons\u201d binding for Railjack.\n    * Previously players could unknowingly bind over this functionality as it was not listed in the Key Bindings screen.\n  * Added an icon above planets in the Navigation Menu once a player has completed all of its nodes.\n    * Both Normal Path and Steel Path track planet completion separately, and have their own unique icons to denote completion!\n  * Added a \u201cFire Manual Trigger Weapons Continuously\u201d setting to the Accessibility menu.\n    * Toggling this on will allow you to shoot manual trigger weapons (including Semi, Burst, and Charge Trigger types) continuously on a singular input. \n\n\n\n**CHANGES**\n\n[eac888d7210afbda442e8ef6914a709c.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/eac888d7210afbda442e8ef6914a709c.jpg)\n\n**Ceno & Vahd Suit Now Available For Drifter **\n\nBecome one with the Ostron as Drifter! The Ceno and Vahd Masks, Pauldrons, Greaves and Apparel have been converted to fit the Drifter and can now be equipped on them. \n\nPurchasing or crafting any of these customizations will include both the Operator and Drifter variants! For those of you that already own Ceno/Vahd items, the Drifter versions will be added to your inventory upon downloading the update and logging in. \n\n**In-Game Market Change:** Operator Suits that can also be used on Drifter now indicate such in their Market screen. It reads \u201cThis item provides cosmetics for both Operator and Drifter\u201d. \n\n[a4075185f4208ba667dd749d16958462.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/a4075185f4208ba667dd749d16958462.jpg)\n\n**Line Of Sight Improvements**\n\nAs a continuation of our efforts to improve LOS systems within Warframe, which have been ongoing since Dante Unbound, we\u2019ve made further strides towards improving how we handle these checks.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, we\u2019ve improved the consistency and performance of the underlying LOS systems within the game by handling how we detect unrendered targets, in addition to improvements we\u2019ve made in recent hotfixes. \n\nAbilities that use LOS checks already have been updated to this improved technology! Additionally, with these improvements, we can now easily shift over any Warframe Ability that relies on LOS checks to be seamlessly migrated to this new, more accurate system, meaning we\u2019re able to act faster on any outlying offenders that may arise. \n\nTo name a few Warframe abilities that benefit from this with Jade Shadows:\n\n  * Gara's Passive\n  * Nyx\u2019s Psychic Bolts\n  * Inaros\u2019 Scarab Swarm\n  * Wukong\u2019s Primal Fury\n  * Gyre's Rotorswell\n  * Styanax's Axios Javelin (Vortex)\n  * Xaku\u2019s Grasp of Lohk\n    * This also fixes ragdolled enemies not getting targeted by Grasp of Lohk weapons. \n\n\n\n**Deep Archimedea Changes & Fixes**",
            "Ye so ill probably use it on Lex, with galv stacks 60% fire rate and 60% multishot isnt as nice as gaining punch on Lex base form and some wall collision ignorance on the incarnon plus the massive DPS increase",
            "* As mentioned in Devstream #179, Deep Archimedea and Netracells now award Standing with the Cavia Syndicate. Deep Archimedea will award 15,000 Standing upon completion of the third mission with any modifiers (or none at all!) and Netracells will award 5,000 Standing per completed Netracell. \n  * Reduced the duration reduction of the \u201cAbbreviated Abilities\u201d Personal Modifier from 75% to 50%.\n  * Changed how Deep Archimedea\u2019s \u201cUntreatable\u201d Personal Modifier interacts with Health Orbs in the following scenarios:\n    * **Lavos\u2019 Universal Orbs:** Energy can now be gained from these Orbs when picked up, but not Health (as intended with this modifier). \n    * **Equilibrium Mod:** Energy can now be gained when picking up Health Orbs, but not the other way around (as intended with this modifier). \n      * A \u201cHealth Pickup is blocked\u201d HUD pop-up will now appear at the bottom of your screen to help provide more information in the scenarios above.\n  * Changed \u201cUnified Purpose\u201d\u2019s description to better explain what this Deviation does: \n    * Now reads: \u201cEnemies can target and destroy Conduits.\u201d\n  * Toned down the intensity of Void explosions caused by the \u201cPostmortal Surges\u201d Risk Variable. \n  * Made the following changes and fixes to the \u201cPowerless\u201d Personal Modifier to improve its functionality:\n    * Added an icon to the HUD to indicate the required number of kills. When the kill count requirement is met, the icon will disappear.\n    * Fixed Powerless blocking Ability effects from other players interacting with their kits.\n    * Fixed Powerless preventing players from using Transference.\n    * Fixed Powerless not properly applying to Clients.\n    * Fixed an issue where Powerless would appear to not countdown following the first mission, causing the player to be unable to finish the Modifier\u2019s requirements to remove its detriment.\n    * Fixed Powerless not progressing from Squad kills while in a Necramech.\n  * Fixed Clients not receiving Research Points from their selected Individual Parameters equipment if invited by a Host active within a Deep Archimedea Mission.\n  * Fixed the HUD buff icon for the \u201cKnifestep Syndrome\u201d Personal Modifier remaining visible regardless of whether or not it is actually active.\n  * Fixed an issue where Client\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have their suggested/chosen Deep Archimedea equipment count towards the activities reward track if invited by a Host already in a Deep Archimedea mission.\n\n\n\n**Assassin Drop Table Changes**\n\n  * Increased (Shadow) Stalker\u2019s drop rate for Despair, Scimitar Engines Blueprint, Hate, War, and Broken War to 11.73% each.\n    * Dread\u2019s drop chance has been reduced on both Stalker (64.8%) and Shadow Stalker (41.33%) to compensate.\n    * Note: The Drop Chance of rolling a reward from this Drop Table is unchanged (i.e. 50%). \n  * Wolf of Saturn Six now has a guaranteed (100%) Weapon Part drop per kill, increased from 35%. \n    * This drop rate was originally designed for The Wolf of Saturn Six Nightwave Series, where a) all players were marked with his Death Mark and b) he had an increasing chance to spawn in-mission while the Series was live. Now, players farming the Wolf Sledge can only do so via Wolf Beacons, so drop rates have been amended with this in mind. \n\n\n\n**Feral/Wild Kubrow Fur Updates**\n\nIn the Dante Unbound update we updated the fur on Companion Kubrows to give them a more realistic look and feel. To reiterate: \n\n  * Improved lighting and shading response in different environments for better texture resolution. \n  * Improved fur density so that it looks softer and fluffier.\n  * Added depth to fur color and shading.\n\n\n\nWe have applied the same upgrades listed above to the following wild Kubrow-type/adjacent creatures: \n\n  * Feral Kubrow\n  * Drahk \n  * Sentinel Stover\n  * Vallis Kubrodon \n\n\n\n**General Changes**\n\n  * You can now replay the Whispers in the Walls Quest! \n    * To re-experience the trials and tribulations between Loid, Albrecht, the Cavia and the creeping Indifference go to your Codex > Quests > Locate the Whispers in the Wall Quest and select the \u201cReplay Quest\u201d button to begin again. \n  * In order to better manage data, we have added a maximum amount of Adversaries (Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos) that can be stored in the Codex\u2019s \u201cUniverse\u201d tab. \n    * If a player reaches a total of 150 Adversaries (Converted or Vanquished), they will be prompted to make space in their saved history by deleting entries before confronting a new Adversary. This is accomplished by using the \u201c**Relinquish Adversaries\u201d** option in the Codex.   \n[927b40d5a75a2d05dc516ee1d0bbb2b6.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/927b40d5a75a2d05dc516ee1d0bbb2b6.jpg)\n    * Please note that any Converted Adversaries will no longer be in your inventory if their history is deleted. This is reflected in the confirmation message given when you attempt to Relinquish an Adversary.\n  * We\u2019ve improved the Warframe neck animations so that they no longer turn their head like an owl and distort their head/neck.   \n[1d9b282b6219d734794124f2f7c60760.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/1d9b282b6219d734794124f2f7c60760.jpg)\n  * Improved the responsiveness of holding the Melee Attack input to perform a throw for Melee weapons with ranged attacks (ex: Sigma & Octantis). Pressing and holding the Melee attack input now throws after one swing instead of two. \n    * As a result of this change, it is now easier to activate Tennokai with Glaives in the window it is available. Prior to this change, the second swing could prevent you from hitting Tennokai before the timer ran out. \n    * This also fixes multiple issues with thrown weapons and Tennokai: \n      * Fixed Wolf Sledge not benefitting from Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed Mods or Tennokai\u2019s Wind Up Speed bonus. \n      * Fixed instances where the Wolf Sledge\u2019s Tennokai Heavy Attack would not complete (the animation would halt halfway-through and leave players stuck mid swing until they Melee attacked again). \n      * Fixed an issue where throwing a Glaive manually (ie. by releasing the Melee attack input instead of auto-throwing) would consume and waste Tennokai unnecessarily.\n  * Trading Legendary Arcanes now requires you to be Mastery Rank 11. \n    * It\u2019s important to note that only the player trading requires MR 11 and not the receiver. \n      * We needed to address an issue with exploitative Legendary Arcanes farming and ban-evasion account creation used to trade Legendary Arcanes. Other options we experimented with had the risk of innocent players getting caught in the crossfire of the ban-evasion subjects. When we took a look at Trading stats we found that a very small number of players below Mastery Rank 10 trade Legendary Arcanes, and therefore decided to go this route. This is purely a means of deterring the bad actors and ensuring legitimate trading for players. \n  * You can now trigger an early start to Void Armageddon waves by interacting with Exodampers. \n    * The long period between waves was originally added to give players time to set up beforehand, but for some this wait period was not necessary, so we have added a way to expedite the process for those who want to jump right in! \n  * Defense missions will no longer be unnecessarily extended whenever enemies are affected by Nyx\u2019s \u201cMind Control\u201d or Garuda\u2019s \u201cBlood Altar.\u201d Instead, they\u2019ll work similarly to Revenant\u2019s Thralls, where invulnerable enemies don\u2019t count towards the remaining enemy tally required to progress to the next wave. \n  * We\u2019ve improved enemy spawn logic in Excavation missions to decrease the wait time between completing Excavators.\n    * This addresses the player reported issue that it often would take far too long for enemies to spawn when moving from one Excavator to another.\n  * Topaz Archon Shards have been changed to grant Shields from enemies hit by Blast Damage to enemies killed with it.\n    * The description in-game has always stated \u201cKills\u201d but this was not actually the case - Shields were being regenerated from enemies hit with Blast Damage. While we understand that this changes the efficacy of the perk and deviates away from what players have been used to, the change was made to avoid photosensitivity issues resulting from Shields breaking and recharging quickly in certain scenarios (ex: Mesa\u2019s Peacemaker Regulators with Blast Damage).\n  * Changed the Braton Incarnon Genesis\u2019s Evolution III Perk (On Punch Through Hit: 20% chance for 10% Ammo restored) to give 10% of the Braton\u2019s Maximum Ammo instead of 10% of an Ammo pickup.\n    * On an unmodded Braton Prime, this means the Perk will now give 60 Ammo instead of the previous 8 Ammo when it triggers.",
            "* Updated Market Blueprint descriptions for Warframes, Archwings, Archwing Weapons, Necramechs, and Weapons to more clearly outline the free path to earning them.\n    * Descriptions have been standardized to include important details such as:\n      * Quest or Mastery Rank requirements\n      * Syndicates they are acquired from\n      * Specific missions or Planets to farm on\n      * Brief instruction on how to acquire necessary keys or currency (ex: Mutalist Alad V Coordinates, Kullervo\u2019s Bane, etc.) \n      * And more!\n    * While the Wiki is an invaluable resource for many players, our goal is to increase access to key information in-game as a starting off point. For those looking for more in-depth farming tips, the Wiki, our drop table site, and other community-made resources are king. \n    * Fixed a variety of Warframes and weapons having incorrect or missing Market Blueprint descriptions. \n  * Updated and standardized resource descriptions for a variety of resources, components, keys, and tokens. \n    * Since The Duviri Paradox update introduced the ability to see resource descriptions on-hover in your Foundry - in addition to already being able to Chat Link them - we feel it is especially important that these descriptions include a general overview of how to acquire these items. These are not meant to be comprehensive, but still offer enough detail for players to farm them successfully. \n    * Updated descriptions include (but are not limited to) the following:\n      * Necralisk Tokens, Debt-Bonds, and Orokin Matrices\n      * Rare Gems requiring specific mining tools\n      * Damaged Necramech components\n      * Items acquired from Invasion missions\n      * Items with special acquisition paths (Anomaly Shards, Kullervo\u2019s Bane, etc. )\n      * Dragon Keys\n      * Sentient Cores \n      * Variety of items missing planet or node names, and more. \n    * Note: Fishing resources have yet to be updated to this new standard. \n  * Advanced Nosam Cutter can now be used to acquire Rare Orb Vallis Gems (Zodian and Thyst).\n    * Now both the Advanced Nosam Cutter and Sunpoint Plasma Drill can be used to mine all rare gems across landscapes. \n    * Also updated rare gem and mining tool descriptions to better communicate these requirements. \n\n\n  * The following Mods are no longer eligible to be traded or sold from Inventory. Essentially, they have been given the same treatment as Mentor\u2019s Legacy to prevent players from removing Mods that can only be acquired once. If you have already sold the following Mods, you can submit a ticket to our fantastic Support Team at [support.warframe.com](http://support.warframe.com). \n    * Mountain's Edge Stance Mod\n      * Awarded from completing The Duviri Paradox Quest. \n    * Thermia Fracture Rewards - these were already untradeable, we\u2019ve just also made them unsellable from Inventory: \n      * Amalgam Serration \n      * Amalgam Organ Shatter \n      * Amalgam Barrel Diffusion \n      * Amalgam Shotgun Barrage \n    * Daily Tribute Milestone Login Rewards these were already untradeable, we\u2019ve just also made them unsellable from Inventory: \n      * Primed Vigor \n      * Primed Shred \n      * Primed Sure Footed\n      * Primed Fury\n  * Switching through the different Verse of Dante\u2019s Final Verse will now play the associated video preview for the Verse you have selected instead of looping through the same video for all. \n  * The VFX of Excalibur\u2019s Exalted Blade has had a visual refresh! The energy emanating from the Blade has an all new flow to it. \n  * GI Lighting Changes & Fixes: \n    * Adjusted ambient GI lighting in the Orbiter for better contrast in the lighting. \n      * This also improves the lightning in the Arsenal, which we received feedback on being too dark for the purposes of fashion framing. We have more changes and fixes planned for the next update.   \n[6ecefabf3605c405d7b5bce642d80e95.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/6ecefabf3605c405d7b5bce642d80e95.jpg)\n    * Updated GI Lighting in the Helminth room, including improvements to the pond beneath the floor to increase fish visibility.\n    * Adjusted lighting throughout the Orbiter to feel more realistic based on direct vs indirect light sources.\n    * Updated the lighting on various waters in the Drifter Camp so that the waterfalls aren\u2019t glowing white and blown out at night. Also fixed being unable to see the fog over the landscape when viewing it from the Orbiter window. \n    * Fixed GI lighting shadow issues with Decorations in the Orbiter. \n    * Fixed some indirect lighting in the Orbiter to help alleviate areas that were far too dark. \n  * Synced Last Gap\u2019s controller haptics with the heart beat sound. \n  * Improved the frequency of appearance for the new Albrecht\u2019s Laboratories tiles that were released with Dante Unbound.\n  * Updated older Grineer decals to improve resolution and quality.\n  * Changed Tenet Diplos to continuously burst fire at already marked targets while aiming and holding the firing input. \n  * Argon Crystals are now automatically waypointed when dropped by enemies or resource containers in-mission. \n  * \"Parkour Velocity\" mods now affect a few more parkour-related activities:\n    * Increases velocity when wall running parallel to the wall\n    * Increases velocity when wall jumping away from a wall\n    * Increases the instantaneous velocity change when performing a double jump\n  * Updated the visual materials on the Dread, Hate, and Despair.\n    * This change also made many untintable areas now tintable (notably all of the metal on the Dread).   \n[b52c07d12eb55deab8a0106b8a9354e7.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/b52c07d12eb55deab8a0106b8a9354e7.jpg)\n  * Updated the \u201cFrom on High\u201d Nightwave Act description to include K-Drives. \n    * It now reads: \u201cKill 100 grounded enemies while soaring above the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, or Cambion Drift on your K-Drive or Archwing.\u201d\n  * Removed the Kuva Sobek from Conclave eligibility due to not being Conclave balanced. \n  * Updated Lavos\u2019 Valence Formation Augment Mod description for accuracy (the Augment itself has not changed, this is only a description update).. \n    * It now reads: \u201cCasting an Ability imbued with extra Elemental Damage applies that Element as a 200% bonus to your weapons with guaranteed Status for 20s.\u201d.\n  * Adjusted Ordis\u2019 Camera angle and gave him Idle Animations in the Drifter Camp during the New War Quest.\n  * Your Warframe falling into a void while in Transference will no longer cause a screen fade-to-block which deactivates your Warframe\u2019s abilities. \n    * Players often hop into Operator/Drifter mode to traverse gaps, but doing so over a void would reset your Warframe once they hit the teleport volume. If you ever experienced a fade-to-black while Void Slinging over a void, this was what caused it! Now this will no longer happen, provided you are in Transference when your Warframe falls into the teleport volume. \n  * Kuva and Tenet weapons with 58% Elemental Bonus or above will now automatically round that value up to 60%.\n    * Players who have existing Tenet and Kuva weapons (including those pending in the Foundry) with 58%+ Valence Bonus will have this value rounded up to 60% upon logging in after downloading the update.\n  * Increased the window for players to join an in-progress mission when playing a Star Chart node for the first time. \n    * Previously, the window was much smaller for first-time joiners, to avoid them missing key cutscenes or transmissions that appear at the start of the mission. The unintended result was that many players ended up starting a new session and playing the mission alone.\n  * Made a small adjustment to ambient sounds in the Strata Relay. \n  * The Warframe Launcher will now display \u201cDownloading new content\u201d once the download actually starts.\n    * Previously it said \u201cChecking for new content\u201d when both checking and downloading the content.\n  * Reduced the damage of the Juggernaut\u2019s ranged spine strike. \n    * The amount of Toxin Status Effects it caused could be difficult for newer players to tackle, so we\u2019ve reduced it to make it more manageable. \n  * Updated the Helminth Ability \u201cExpedite Suffering\u201d description for accuracy (the ability itself has not changed, this is only a description update).\n    * Now reads: \"Condense all Slash and Toxin Status Effects into a single damage instance.\"\n  * Updated Dante\u2019s Fourth Ability \u201cFinal Verse: Tragedy\u201d description for accuracy (the ability itself has not changed, this is only a description update)..\n    * Now reads: \u201cTwo Dark Verses cast in succession attack enemies. Damage Over Time from Slash, Heat and Toxin Status Effects accumulates in a single blast.\u201d\n  * Updated the Templar Prime Operator/Drifter Transference Suit Collection to clarify its usability by both the Operator and Drifter.\n    * Now reads: \u201cThe dress uniform worn with pride by Harrow's faithful legions. Includes the full set for both Operator and Drifter.\u201d\n  * Updated Nezha\u2019s \u201cDivine Retribution\u201d Augment description for accuracy (the Augment itself has not changed, this is only a description update).\n    * Now reads: \u201cStatus Effects spread to all speared enemies. Spear explosions scale by 1.5x of remaining Slash, Toxin and Heat Status Effects. Base Radius is 14m.\u201d\n  * Changed the Update Screen to use release date (year and month) instead of the update numbers for the listed Updates. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**TOP FIXES**",
            "* Fixed Dante\u2019s passive only applying to enemies who were scanned in-mission. Now it should apply to enemies who were fully scanned before the mission started. \n  * Fixed Sevagoth\u2019s Shadow not benefiting from the Shadow Haze Augment Mod on enemies inflicted with Death\u2019s Harvest. \n  * Fixed being unable to Auto-Melee as Chroma while Spectral Scream is active. \n  * Fixed held items (Datamass for example) causing visibility issues with the Grimoire equipped. \n    * The item will now be hidden when aiming and/or firing with the Grimoire to prevent it from blocking view. \n  * Fixed being unable to throw Voidrig\u2019s Necraweb Grenade. \n  * Fixed the \u201cLoid\u201d fast travel option in the pause menu taking you to the front of the doors to the Sanctum Anatomica instead of directly to him. \n  * Fixed the Host\u2019s invisibility option for Warframe abilities (Semi-Cloak or Glow-Cloak) overriding Clients\u2019 invisibility option. \n  * Fixed Melee Crescendo stacks vanishing after Host migration for Ash players that collected them with Blade Storm while holding a Primary Weapon. \n  * Fixed Host and Client going back to completely different areas when the Host aborts, but still remaining in the same squad (e.g. Host returns to Obiter, while Client returns to Cetus). \n  * Fixed an issue where one player using Transference would close the Ability menu for everybody in the squad. \n  * Fixed being unable to use Last Gasp if the \"Ability Menu\" controller binding has been replaced with \"Activate Selected Power\".\n  * Fixed the alt-fire not throwing discs in Duviri Enigma Puzzles if the player has a Melee weapon equipped. \n  * Fixed the Derivator Crewman\u2019s energy dome showing through Grendel when feasted, and partially limiting his movement. \n  * Fixed being unable to cast/cancel abilities or attack as Wukong after ledge grabbing during Cloud Walker\u2019s cast animation. \n  * Fixed loss of function (invisible weapons, being unable to reload, etc.) as Wukong after hitting a teleport volume while in Cloud Walker. \n  * Fixed loss of function as Valkyr after entering a Nullifier Bubble during Hysteria.\n  * Fixed Saryn\u2019s Toxic Lash affecting Clients damage numbers by displaying the wrong damage values (UI only issue). \n  * Fixed loss of function when attempting to leave Submersible Archwing in the Grineer Sealab Tileset. \n  * Fixed Shade\u2019s Ghost Mod randomly deactivating while surrounded by enemies who are in range.\n    * This was because Shade would choose one target to trigger invisibility, meaning the effect would end once they were killed. Now this Mod\u2019s effect is no longer tied to one target, so the invisibility will persist so long as players do not engage in behaviors that will disrupt it. \n  * Fixed Zephyr\u2019s Tail Wind not deactivating while the player is in Bleedout. \n  * Fixed cases of players receiving a different rotation reward than what was displayed in-mission. \n  * Fixed a case of the Total Eclipse Augment offering a permanent Eclipse buff for Clients if another player also casts Eclipse. \n  * Fixed being able to dislodge Fragmented enemies from Garuda\u2019s Blood Altar. \n  * Fixed function loss for remaining player(s) if both Host and another Client leave at the end of a round in The Index.\n  * Fixed Mirage\u2019s Hall of Mirrors clones not shooting Incarnon Form weapons unless they had hit enemies before the Incarnon Form was triggered.\n  * Fixed being unable to progress in Void Armageddon Bounties after completing the Bounty requirements. \n    * Prior to this fix, players would be forced the extract after completing the Bounty requirements. Since this is an endless mission type we want to give players the option to stay and complete more Rounds if they wish. \n  * Fixed the Temporal Prime Ephemera causing Focus Badges to be oversized.\n  * Fixed lighting glitches and intense bloom when switching between certain weapons (notably the Tenet Grigori) in the Arsenal.\n  * Fixed being unable to jump as Operator after using Transference mid-movement.\n  * Fixed the Onos Evolution V challenge (Complete a solo mission with an Incarnon Weapon equipped in every slot) not completing when entering Extraction in Titania\u2019s Razorwing form.\n  * Fixed Onos\u2019 Incarnon Form projectiles hitting enemies that are directly behind the player instead of where they are firing. \n  * Fixed the Distressed Pipes in Alchemy missions not properly resetting after being destroyed with a high damage weapon, which could lead to a halt in mission progress. \n  * Fixed Zephyr and Nyx being unable to acquire Decrees in Duviri while Tail Wind hovering or using Absorb, respectively.\n  * Fixed the increasing likelihood of not receiving Void Traces in Railjack Voidstorms when opening Relics over multiple Voidstorm missions without resetting the session.\n  * Fixed K-Drive Board Slam kills not properly tracking for Clients for Yareli\u2019s \u201cWaverider\u201d Quest Challenge.\n  * Fixed an issue where Auto-Melee wouldn\u2019t work while on a Zipline.\n  * Fixed Mag\u2019s Magnetize Ability not taking effect when casted onto a target ragdolled by her Pull Ability.\n  * Fixed Mag\u2019s Magnetize Ability causing ragdolled enemies to float, jitter around or fly away. \n  * Fixed an issue where repeatedly using Transference in the Orbiter would cause the Warframe to lose functionality.\n  * Fixed recasting Hydroid\u2019s Plunder ability causing its Armor buff to stack indefinitely.\n  * Fixed Ivara\u2019s Artemis Bow not benefitting from the Galvanized Aptitude Mod. \n  * Fixed The War Within Quest replay not starting immediately due to players being unable to select the first stage \u201cInvestigate the Reservoir on Lua\u201d node in the Star Chart. \n  * Fixed Operator\u2019s Appearance switching to a different Appearance Config Slot than what\u2019s selected after using Transference to and from Warframe in Orbiter. \n  * Fixed the Prime toggle not applying to Protea Prime\u2019s Abilities when a TennoGen Skin is equipped.\n  * Fixed an issue where Client AoE/Radial damage was not being absorbed into Zephyr\u2019s Tornados. \n  * Fixed the Pack Leader Mod reducing the amount of Overguard on a Companion if they already have the Mod's max amount (+1200).\n  * Fixed Mag\u2019s Magnetize sometimes not working when cast on ragdolled enemies. \n  * Fixed Protea\u2019s Temporal Erosion Augment being able to armor strip allies, instead of just enemies as intended. \n  * Fixed Dante\u2019s Wordwarden not sharing Noctua\u2019s elemental damage to squad mates if Dante is a Client. \n  * Fixed enemies in Grendel\u2019s gut triggering the Energy Exhaustion personal modifier in Deep Archimedea. \n  * Fixed area of effect of Inaros\u2019 Sandstorm remaining indefinitely if a Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos performs a finisher on Inaros while in Sandstorm. \n  * Fixed Chroma\u2019s Guardian Armor Augment not triggering Archon Intensify when healing allies. \n  * Fixed Grendel being able to fire primary weapons in Pulverize after casting Aquablades with the Surging Blades Augment equipped.\n  * Fixed being unable to use the Fishing menu if the Ability Menu controller binding is unbound. \n    * Now, when switching between mouse and controller the button callouts will reflect the \u201cClassic Controls\u201d. You can also now use the back button to exit the gear picker without having to pick something. \n  * Fixed being unable see Mirage\u2019s Hall of Mirrors clones in Grendel Locator missions if you have a Companion equipped. \n    * Also fixed being unable to Melee Attack after casting Hall of Mirrors under the same conditions. \n  * Fixed getting permanently slowed by a Gruzzling after casting Mag\u2019s Magnetize on it and letting a Warframe stand in its slow field while in Operator mode. \n  * Fixed cases where the Extraction timer would no longer count down for remaining players post-Host migration. \n  * Fixed Grendel losing momentum when casting Abilities while in Pulverize. \n  * Fixed being able to apply 5 Puncture Stacks to VIP enemies with Overguard, instead of the intended 3. \n  * Fixed Murmur enemies not properly ragdolling when caught in Khora\u2019s Strangledome. \n  * Fixed Archon Nira not engaging in combat and floating in the air after the end of the intro cinematic. \n  * Fixed Dante's Pageflight Paragrimms targeting inactive enemy turrets, such as inactive/undamageable Orokin or Corpus turrets. \n  * Fixed weapons in Incarnon Mode (notably Paris Prime and Dread Incarnon) dealing less damage to enemies trapped in Zephyr\u2019s Tornadoes. \n\n\n\n**OPTIMIZATIONS**"

        "content": "So I don\u2019t ever post on my Reddit account but I do sort of lurk around reading posts here and there and I\u2019ve been reading different reactions to Jade Eximus. Personally, I found them fun and encouraged more active gameplay out of some of the more afk builds that are becoming more common, and introduced an actual challenge beyond extreme level/ armor scaling. But THIS was so bad I had to post it somewhere hoping that this is some sort of bug. And this happened to me TWICE beforehand. \n\nExplanation (skip this paragraph if you can see lol):\nIn this clip you\u2019ll see that the Hyldryn is staying on the target to provide shields to the defense target while I cast Tentacle Swarm to provide crowd control in the area while I go to kill an Eximus that was in the area. Another Jade Eximus appears and (apparently from BEHIND A DOOR) targets the Hyldryn and in FIVE SECONDS absolutely shreds the defense target, causing the mission to fail. The eximus I tagged was the only one I could see in the area.\n\nIn what universe is this fair? An eximus that can attack from what appears to be more than double my cc range, is not effected by my cc anyways, and can shred a defense target faster than anyone can have the opportunity to react. I\u2019m happy to have challenging content but this is just excessive. I understand that it\u2019s not good for allies to stand on the defense target as it can get hit by stray bullets and draws more enemies to the target but even in those cases you have a good while to clear the enemies from the area or move before it gets out of control. It\u2019s actually kind of ironic because the Jade Eximus seem to be made ignoring all the restrictions most warframes have to follow. They have incredibly strong damage with no obvious LOS check all with ridiculous range. This isn\u2019t a challenge, it\u2019s just straight up impossible to handle. \n\nSide note: Why do eximus abilities effect defense targets anyways? They\u2019re already difficult enough being immune to all cc, I don\u2019t see the point in them nuking the defense target too.",

            "This will probably get buried under all the comments here but allow me to clarify a few things. \n\n1. The damage is perfectly fine on players and as I state IN THE POST I absolutely welcome a unit punishing AFK players \n\n2. My problem is not that it punishes AFK players, it\u2019s that the punishment ends the game for everyone who\u2019s actually playing properly \n\n3. Im not the hyldryn? I know how to play around the eximus? Im genuinely confused at how someone else going AFK is MY \u201cskill issue\u201d. \n\n4. Just to be absolutely clear: if the hyldryn went down as punishment for being afk, maybe even a noticeable amount of damage to the objective to encourage players to rally back to the area, that would\u2019ve been fine. It\u2019s the fact that the game ended faster than I could even notice the health bar depleting that\u2019s bothering me. \n\n5. No \u201cjust subsume\u201d is not a good counterpoint",
            "I see too many people saying \"don't afk on the objective!\" Like the person is just unaware, but what if they do it on purpose?\n\nThis is an extremely effective grieffing tool and will absolutely be used as such, let's see how those opinions change when people start trolling on purpose",
            "I agree completely. My genuine concerns with this isnt that it\u2019s too strong, it\u2019s the ability it gives the toxic players for griefing. Anyone who is targeted by the jade eximus who wants to fail the mission for everyone now can. I hate that there is toxic players in this community but it is a sad fact. I\u2019m assuming they are going to remove its damage on defense targets when they realize this. \n\nSide note, don\u2019t just say play solo. If an enemy is forcing the entire player base to play solo it\u2019s a problem with the enemy.",

You stop to respond a message and you are dead, you want to write something to squad, you are dead, wanna use Mesa's 4 for more than 4 seconds, you are dead. I think its a cool mechanic but the damage is off the charts. I played Belly of the Beast on SP for a day and it looked like a green laser hydra, you shot 1 laser and 2 more would appear, i think i spent more time looking up and destroying lasers than playing the actual mission.",

Kick them out asap instead of this bs. It's completely unnecessary and we already had 2 different eximus that targeted you with damaging bubbles. Rocket League for example doesn't even wait 1 minute to kick afk players.\n\n-Nothing stops the afks to be dead the entire mission while you complete it for them. Or respawn right at the end.\n-Neither them running some immortal frame like Revenant and doesn't helping for any reason.\n\nI know those things because I've been getting those afks on my squads, especially the first case. I got some prints and clips from a guy just running around on sp circuit, not that would change anything. Still I'm right here having my invisible operator taking dmg while reviving a squad mate, then instantly being dead when going back to frame, resulting on two people down.",

We can see them. Most require LoS.\nThe jade eximus is blasting the objective (thanks to the afk one) from a different realm, all the while the team is engaging with the game and looked away for a sec.\n\nBy the time the objective HP really dropped, it was too late for anyone on a different side of the map to intervene.\n\nThis was not a Demolyst, this was not a Hemocyte or something else that is a boss unit, it's a god damn eximus, a random elite enemy.\n\nSo, in a mission a player can, either by malice or distraction instantly end the mission for you in the time you look away, no warnings because that's a \"elite random enemy\" and the objective doesn't give any warning sound off.\n\nImagine if I could simply void dash the capture target off the map and he doesn't get respawned, but instead is deleted, mission failed. If i could actively add NEGATIVE progress onto an interception console.\n\nThat would be horrible, that would be dumb. \nI'm not playing league of legends, i don't play Warframe to be at the mercy of some random guy.\nThis has to be changed, it has to, or the incursion of trolling and frustration would be catastrophic for the game's health.",

You don't know which one is targetting you because they can do so from behind pillars and WITHOUT BEING ON FULL ALERT LEVEL. I've had them target me when the enemy didn't even know where the fuck I was. I've had them target me alone in a room with no visible eximus from the door whatsoever. You basically just get fucked by a random laser that moves and does too much damage for it to be worth emptying a full clip on the orb that spawns it.\n\nAlso nothing else in the starchart deletes defense targets like this so of course no one is going to be always looking at its health bar.

That made me instantly think of the lvl 30+ solo defense with 0 damage on the objective riven challenge, that I've failed so many times due to a fire eximus ignoring Frost's shield and things like that. \n\nWhile I absolutely love the addition of this new Jade Eximus, I don't feel like it makes the game more challenging, but rather a pain in the ahh most of the times, still think it might not need to be \"addressed\" by the devs, maybe just a little tweak and give the community time to adapt to them",

I used to play Gauss Prime in Steel path Void Cascade and I could go from objective to objective in 10-15 seconds tops assuming I don't hit my head on too many walls. \n\nThe other thing I have is with this hatred towards afk playstyles. While I do agree that it's better for people with two button stay in one place builds like Saryn to go solo, just as how you like to run and gun around the map, what makes others happy and feel powerful is staying in one spot and watching mobs die. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean people should be punished for it. It was the same when Kuva Bramma and Zarr were at the peak of their power. It was peak in terms of enjoyment I had for the game and they just nerfed it because people were crying that they couldn't do anything (??) while people destroyed the whole map with bramma. I just hate it when devs listen to the people that listen to people that aren't even doing the hardest level content in the game, and fuck it up for the people who do. Kuva Bramma in endless in steel path and even SP Void Cascade was so much fun. Hell, in endless I could've just gotten someone with bramma and solo carry for 15-20 minutes while we either watch something on our phones or second monitor and switch out. It was so good back then not only because of how strong it was but how convenient it was. It's not worth running it these days if I have to get all ammo economy mods I can shove onto my build and also carry ammo refills if I want to have the same experience as back then.\n\n  \nRant aside this doesn't even look like steel path, so idk. One thing I want to add is if you don't like that someone is doing an afk build, what's stopping you exactly from dipping and requeueing? You don't get a penalty for leaving the mission before it ends anyway. In a way, crying for the devs to punish afk players is the same thing as what the afk's are doing. You are not any different.

            "\\*\\*EDIT: It seems like people read this and think I'm advocating for AFKing, so let me make this clear: I'm not.  I'm advocating for being able to take a four second pause every once in a while because life exists outside of the game.  Certainly, you could pause in more convenient locations than others, but a misplaced pause shouldn't end the mission.  Having a defense objective go from 100% to 0% in four seconds flat isn't good game design, no matter  how inconveniently you've placed yourself. \\*\\*\n\nI will push back on this a little.\n\nPeople need time to sneeze.  Or take a drink.  Or go to another tab for a hot second and go five seconds back on a video 'cause they missed what was said.  Or talk to a loved one.  The game shouldn't be so punishing as to force people to be glued to a screen 100% of the time, excluding all other inputs in their life.\n\nFuthermore, the beams can charge up from off-camera, and the noise isn't audible if you have the volume down low. (I keep my volume to a point where I can hear gunshots and a handful of sounds and not much else; I had no idea that there was a charge up sound for the beams until someone pointed it out in another thread.)\n\nAnd, just in general, the beams shouldn't do this much damage to an objective.  Nothing should.  That shit is wild.  Even if they noticed and slid to the left, it would still do an incredible amount of damage to the defense objective as it followed them, leaving the objective in a much more vulnerable state for future rounds, wherein another beam can just casually pass over it and end the mission in just a few seconds.\n\nI'd be astounded if this isn't hotfixed soon (or, if it hasn't been already).",

            "This is the first time I've seen a mechanic in this game that can, in the right circumstances, be used to troll in an mission objective failure. \n\nOnce word gets around, some sad sacks will start ruining the fun for others just because they can. \n\nBut apparently, this lot are just going to take it and go, \"oh well, hahaha, skill issue I guess. Hahaha\".",
            "It doesn't even need to be immunity, it could even be 60-99% damage reduction.",
            "Do you really think everyone should be 100% focused on the game to the point where they can shot on a ball in 5 seconds when there's little to no indicator that the objective is being obliterated?! Don't Don't say about the health bar, that thing is minuscule when compared to everything drawing your attention",
            "I thought it was a bit obvious, so let me clarify:\n\n**THE JADE LIGHT CANNOT TARGET ANYTHING EXCEPT PLAYERS**, and require Eximus to have both line of sight on a player, and have it as a current target.\n\nIf eximus had other non-player targets, this wouldn't happen. If players pay attention, this won't happen. If players stay AFK in literally every single spot except the objective itself, this won't happen.\n\nBut if someone insist on fullfilling all those conditions at the same time - yes, i guess that makes Silence mandatory for them.",
            "I would say \"play solo\" more than \"skill issue\" in fact because i don't consider being paired with good teammates as a skill.",
            "So the thing is, mobs spread their targeting over the players and the objective. If a player is near, they'll most likely target them first.\n\nIf 2 of the 4 people afk on the objective, guess what? \nThat's 3 of the 5 mobs focusing them. The jade was maybe targeting the player, but slammed the objective down in the same dunk.\n\nSay the guy went to afk somewhere else, he'd be dead, probably, but the objective wouldn't have caught collateral damage.\n\n\nThe exact same thing applies to Blitz eximus. If you stand on the objective, they'll focus you and turn the cryo pod into a broken museum piece. If you stand anywhere else, you will probably get merked, but thr mission stays up.\n\n\n>Like, seriously, even if someone does AFK, you can just go about your business and still get through it.\n\nNo, actually. That's what this video shows.",
            "True that\u2019s just shitty game design, warframe difficulty is next to non existent historically, afkers were never an issue in a timesink game of repetitive (to the point of needing second screen with some sort of webinar) grind, adding some random bs one shot ability won\u2019t magically make gameplay exciting.",
            "It's also \"stinkin thinking\" to expect DE to change something because some people are stubborn and can't stand 5 feet away from the defense objective and can't adapt to New changes. This thing is literally the easiest to avoid... Until the general playerbase dont adapt to \"just stand away from the def obj\" just play solo instead of complaining",

            "Because it IS my, or my teammate's, fault. I'm being seeked by a nuke and stay/get close to a defense target in a defense type mission. I'm paying the price for my own stupidity.",
            "issue is it deals more damage the longer it hits, so even with 99% damage reduction it would still deal a fuckton of damage, just need longer to ramp up",
            "That depends - What does 100% focused mean to you? You don't need to sweat to destroy a green bauble.   \n\nThe health bar is small yes. I rarely, if ever, look at it. So no that's not my argument.   \n\nBut the beam is bright and huge, not much else was there to draw OPs attention - 5 seconds is eons in a fast paced game. I reckon if you don't frequent places like Reddit, discord etc, and don't communicate much in-game (Which is fair) you wouldn't know how the beams function or that you could destroy them.  \n\nBut OP did, and didn't attempt to do anything to counter it. That's all im saying. This might be OPs first interaction with it destroying an objective and its reasonable to not think about the beam being able to destroy it - But now he knows and it shouldn't happen again, granted that he decides to destroy the laser.",
            "There's no point in making an ability mandatory on all frames to counter trolls and/or idiots, the devs should make defence objectives immune to gameplay sabotage by not letting the jade light vapourise them or even just not letting the jade light damage them, either works. That's an issue the devs should fix though, not something you should changr your gear to accomodate.\n\nNever accomodate trolls and people who go afk on top of the objective, that's just normalising gameplay sabotage as if ruining a mission isn't a dick move.",
            "Wait, you mean you haven't unlocked the discord frame that filters trolls from your matchmaking? /s",
            "But the blitz eximus has a cooldown on its abilities. It can't kill a defense objective in a single it.  You have way more time to react.\n\nAs for your last bit, I meant before Jade. And they still can.  I have no doubt in my mind this shit is getting nerfed.",
            "I think the idea is actually good, but it needs a lot of \"except when\"\n\nIt should, given its damage, not damage objectives for example\n\nI also just yesterday experience whats basically spawn killing. The laser killed my sevagoth as i loaded in, i revived myself, but since the laser kept on my sarcophagus, the moment my shadow returned to it and i got into the self revival animation i got blasted again before i could move, causing me to go back into shadow. \n\nSuch things are fine to overlook when you just introduce them to the game, but shouldnt happen once people realize its issues",
            "You're missing the point.\n\nFailure takes time, in warframe.  In any other game mode, you have much longer than four seconds to react to a mission going south.  A hull breach in railjack gives you a minute.  The capture target has to run through the level.  Survival missions take like a minute thirty of zero activity to reach 0 life support.\n\nNothing in this game takes a mission from 100% to 0% in four seconds flat.  At least, nothing used to.",
            "My dude.\n\nYou're not paying the price for your own stupidity if it's someone else being stupid.  You understand that, right?"
