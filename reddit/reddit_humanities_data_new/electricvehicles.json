Fortunately, I\u2019m in a financial position where that isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nI am interested in the IONIQ 6, EV6, ID.4 Pro, and EX30.\n\nFrom a value perspective, does it make the most sense to just wait until the end of my lease and then turn it in with penalty, or buy it out, in order to maximize incentives from Kia for repeat buyer, all else equal?\n\nWith typical Kia residuals, should I enter into another lease or do it an outright purchase (depending on APR) to minimize monthly cost and total cost? Would I be better off just outright purchasing assuming APRs are crap?",

            "Has anyone used NACS to CCS ~~CCS to NACS~~ adapters?  I needed to fast charge Saturday night out-of-town.  Closest charging station was a Tesla which is not compatible (afaik - I didn't check).  I found an Electrify America station that got me to 80% in 10 min.  There are LOTS of Tesla charging stations around here and on routes I'd like to use.  Anyone have experience with the adapters?",
            "Hello everyone,\n\nWe currently own a Tesla Model 3.\n\nWe\u2019ve hit a bit of a dilemma. Our family is about to grow from four to five! When our newest member arrives, our children will be 5, 2, and a newborn. Our two oldest are quite small for their ages.\n\nCurrently, our eldest is sitting rear-facing in a huge Britax Max-Way Plus, but it's time to transition to a forward-facing seat. My wife strongly believes our 2-year-old should stay rear-facing for another year, which complicates things. I might be able to convince her that it\u2019s okay for our 2-year-old to face forward now.\n\nI've been searching for the most narrow car seats on the market, but haven't had much luck. The ones I\u2019ve found so far don\u2019t fit well with the rear-facing baby seat.\n\nI also looked into the Multimac solution. It seems very well-made, but it would cost us around \u20ac3,800 after import taxes. That\u2019s a lot for car seats, but still cheaper than getting a new car.\n\nSpeaking of new cars, I've checked out some electric options. Unfortunately, there aren't many that solve our problem without being significantly more expensive than our current Model 3. For example, I could trade in our Model 3 for about \u20ac26,000, but the cheapest ID Buzz I\u2019ve found is \u20ac44,000. Do you have any suggestions for EV-options that solve our problem without breaking the bank?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your advice and viewpoints on this!",
            "Has anyone in Arizona been able to find a dealer who: 1) is educated on how the Used EV Credit works, 2) is registered to participate, and 3) is willing to honor it?\nI\u2019ve been to 5 different dealers in Phoenix looking at EVs who check all the boxes for the used EV credit but it\u2019s frustrating the lack of knowledge from both sales people and finance managers.\nIs it really that difficult to find a place that will do it?",
            "I am planning on buying a used EV, I found a used 2021 Chevy Bolt with about 40,000 miles. Is there anything I should be cognizant of when I go to look at the car? This is my first time getting an EV and I am particularly concerned about its range since my commute will be about 65 miles each way. Besides checking what the car says the range is, is there anything I can do to check the quality of the battery?",
            "So I am new to electric vehicles. I\u2019ve owned only gas cars so far. My wife leases a Corolla and I own a Jetta. Her lease is up in February and we are looking to get an SUV to replace the Corolla. I have wanted to go with a 1 electric - 1 gas car strategy for a while but I don\u2019t know much about the EV market. We are looking for a small to medium sized SUV. Something like the Nissan Rogue for size. What are ya\u2019lls recommendations for suvs in that size? For budget we\u2019d like to stay under 40k USD if possible. We live in North Carolina. \n\nNo children and none planned for years. Single family home. we both commute three days a week. Hers is ~10 miles and 30min. Mine is about 35 miles and 40min. The idea would be this car would be shared and could be used for all the commute time if the schedules line up right. For charging we\u2019d at minimum get a \u2018slow\u2019 charger (is that the right term?) it would depend on cost if we splurge for one of those very fast charging systems.",
            "We are shopping for our first EV and want something small, so we're likely looking at either a Kona or Bolt in the $20k range. \n\nSince we live in New England and it gets cold in the winter I want to make sure we can pre-condition the cabin (and battery?) while the car is still plugged in each morning. \n\nThe Bolt trim levels and options are easier to find info on because they are all EVs, but I'm having trouble figuring out which trim/options I need to look for on the Kona to make sure we get heated seats and the ability to remotely heat the cabin while the car is still plugged in. Do they all have that ability, or is it only on certain trim levels?",
            "I\u2019ve been playing around with the idea of trading in both my vehicles toward a new or used EV. My father is concerned that during winter, it might not start during the coldest parts. I live and work in north east Ohio. I work 7pm-7am and have no way to charge it while I\u2019m there. Are his concerns legitimate? If so, are there EV\u2019s out there that handle winter well?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s 80 miles round trip for the commute and needs to have AWD because our driveway sucks in winter.",
            "I've been driving a PHEV for the last 11 years and I'm ready to buy a real EV. I  don't want to spend a ton of money on a new car and would love to take advantage of the EV tax credit. I've also got two teens in my house and am mindful of what my insurance will cost when they start driving. Any advice to offer about cars I should be looking at? The Tesla Model Y LR and Model 3 LR are both compelling, particularly now that both qualify for the tax credit.  I've heard the ID.7 may also apply later. And I know Hyundai is also offering discounts. What other EVs will soon be eligible?  \n  \nMy situation:  \n  \n\\[1\\] I live in the Washington DC region  \n\\[2\\] Hoping to spend < $40k-$45k  \n\\[3\\] Looking for an EV built on a car chassis, currently happy with the size of my Prius PHEV  \n\\[4\\] I've been looking at the Telsa Model Y / Model 3, Hyundai Ioniq 5 / Ioniq 6, and Volkswagen ID.7  \n\\[5\\] I'm not in a huge hurry to buy, but want to take advantage of the EX tax credit before a potentially hostile Republican administration gets rid of it.  \n\\[6\\] I work from home and put maybe 8,000-10,000 miles on my car annually... mostly on short trips, but also on much longer road trips. I would appreciate a vehicle with a decent range and ability to charge quickly.  \n\\[7\\] I'm in a single-family home and am currently using a normal wall outlet for my PHEV.   \n\\[8\\] I will install a proper charger once I switch to an EV.  \n\\[9\\] I have two teens and a 55lb dog, which some would think is too much to cram into a sedan. But we've taken my Prius on all sorts of road trips rather than my wife's ICE SUV just because... why waste gas?\n\nI should also mention my wife isn't ready to go full EV, so our household will also have a hybrid to use if needed. Thanks!",

            "I have a 2017 Ford Focus Electric with 60,000 miles on it. I still get around 100 miles per full charge. In spite of having constant air conditioning problems during our Texas summers, I otherwise love the stupid vehicle and have had no other problems with it.\n\nI am the second owner and it has been paid off four about 3 months.\n\nThe battery is still under warranty for another year, and Carvana is offering me $8,000 to sell it to them.\n\nWould I be smart to sell it before that warranty runs out and purchase another vehicle?\n\nI'm looking at a 2017 Chevy Bolt. That car's battery was replaced under recall in Dec. 2001, so it's under warranty for another 85,000 miles or until Dec. 2029.\n\nIt would have more than twice the range of my Focus. It does have more miles on it (close to 100,000).\n\nIt's going for $11,000., but it's eligible for the $4000 EV tax credit. That plus the added $8000 from the sale of my Focus would put me a little head, dollars-wise.\n\nWould I be stupid to do this, or stupid to pass on it?",

Similarly, the checklist (IRS publication 5866-A) says \"Taxpayer must not have claimed this credit in the 3-year period prior to the sale of the qualifying vehicle. Unsure if you qualify?

            "I've been driving a 2019 Kia Niro PHEV and absolutely love it. It almost gets me to work and back on a single charge. Love the EV aspect so much that when the gas engine turns on, it feels something is wrong with the car - the engine sound, vibrations and sluggish feel. Plus hate having to fill in gas (every 2 months) and do oil changes. So I know for sure that my next car will be an EV. Looking at used EVs and two stood out:\n\n- 2021 Model Y, AWD, 130,000 km\n- 2023 Kia Niro Wave EV, 12,000 km\n\nBoth have the same price. I know what to expect from the Niro EV. I'd like to check if I can use my existing snow tires with that one, so it'll save me another $1000+ of not buying new wheels + tires for winter. And sunroof can open. Plus cooling seats in summer is a big win! \n\nBut the Model Y also looks like a great option. I use Waze a lot, so I know I will have to get used to their own apps. But that's a nominal issue. Sunroof can't open, but is panoramic. Also, not sure if this comes with cooling seats, as that's been a great feature in the Niro. \n\nI often drive with my bikes in the back, so I know for sure that both of these will have no issue with that. I will still install a hitch, but I feel safer with the bikes in the car. \n\nAny suggestions?",

An adapter will do nothing for you until Hyundai/Kia/Genesis and Tesla complete the process of adding the former's vehicles to the latter's network.

Bottom line, they are way less likely (11 times less likely per million miles driven) than an ICE vehicle to have a fire. But if they are on fire, and that fire involves the battery, the current thinking is to just let it go to completion.\n\nAt the end of the day, if the high voltage battery pack is involved in the fire, there's nothing anyone is going to do to put that fire out. The fire is self sustaining, creates its own oxygen during the exothermic breakdown of the catalyst, and you can't cool the thing down. You can literally submerge the car in a tank of water for a week, pull it out, and it'll start back up again. You can put a fire blanket over the car, but when it's removed at some point in the future, the car will reignite. There's just no stopping that train, so the best thing to do really is sit back, protect exposures, and let it go. It'll be over in about 30 minutes when all of the available fuel is consumed. Otherwise, spend a few days putting 30,000 gallons of water on the fire and you'll end up with the same result.\n\nThat's a hard thing for a firefighter to do -- to just sit back and do nothing. We are trained to aggressively attack fires, and this is a complete shift in mindset. So yeah, your friend is correct in some ways -- currently firefighting techniques don't address battery pack fires. But we still respond to crashes, still render patient care, and will put our lives on the line if there's a person's life involved. But if it's just property, it's best to just let it happen.",

            "Doors have worked without electricity for thousands of years - for good reason. Someone is always looking for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.",
            "It's sad to say that door handles are now one of the things we pay attention to as we consider different EVs.  It's not just Tesla, obviously; lots of other brands have electrically operated handles that could fail in an emergency, or for that matter in a non-emergency.\n\nNot that mechanical handles are perfect; I had to replace one in my 500e.  But they're less imperfect.",
            "probably happens with ICE cars every day, when people don't know how to use their manual overrides.\n\nonly makes the news when its an EV",
            "Maybe doors should have fucking handles and a slot for a key",
            "With double block some cars will not open without battery. The ones that you can\u2019t open from the inside to avoid theft. You need to go in from the trunk or brake the glass.",
            "Industry disrupter",
            "So do the tesla doors. They have a manual overide for a reason. However this is a likely flaw for a lot of new cars with electric locks when their 12 volt runs out. \n\nIn situations like this a old fashioned manual lock or carrying a glass breaking in your wallet can be. A life saver.",
            "To be honest I think you're actually wrong, as at least on ICE cars the manual override is a fully mechanical one that only extremely excessive rust could possibly cause it to not function anymore.",
            "Right? I don't mind whether the handle is jutting out, or recessed in a concave 'hole', or is a upward-actuated flip-handle as long as its there.  But this 'anti-handle'(relatively speaking) idea is a little too backward indeed.  As for keys I have to agree, many people use fobs daily but at least the few times its somehow needed there is still slots on the front door(s) - aside to of course powered hatches/trunks being keyed too since many of them at least can be physically manpowered reopen even if the electrical side long stopped working.",
            "What modern car still has a slot for a key? All modern cars will keep you locked out if the 12 volt dies.",
            "no, that's pointless. not many people carry the physical key anymore (ie: a keyfob that has an actual metal key hidden in it), and therefore it's not helpful if the car has an actual key slot.\n\nie: i drive my car using only my phone as a key. or sometimes i take the key fob (no, it doesn't have a key in it). therefore i have no metal key.",
            "Agreed, and although not related to this topic I still wanted to mention that I only got a Tesla taxi once and not surprisingly the driver had to handle the rear door both times due to the lack of any 'normal cues' on how to use it .. and hmm now to also think that theres literally no physical non-battery backup for the doors just makes it sound a much more nutty design thats for sure.",

There was a story a few months ago about a woman who drowned in like a 5 ft pond in her Model X. She was conscious and using her phone to ask people to help but they couldn\u2019t get into her vehicle in time because the glass was reinforced.\n\nLook up the death of Angela Chao.",
            "Teslas also have manual overrides",
            "the problem is not the mechanism failing, its the useless meat sack that drives it not knowing how it works or if it even exists.",
            "That\u2019s blatantly not true. Ioniq 5 and 6s have a hidden key slot in the driver\u2019s door handle to open the door when the 12v is dead.",
            "My car's keyfob has a little physical key inside of it and you can use it to unlock the car if either the cars or the keyfob's battery dies. I thought it was pretty standard on most cars.",

            "Mine does. I have a spare key in my fob",
            "My 2024 Volvo has a metal key in the fob and a hidden keyhole behind the door handle. If the battery (either the car\u2019s or the fob\u2019s) dies, I can still gain entry.",
            "Wrong. Most of them do; even the ones with an electronic door release. The BMW iX has a slot hidden under the exterior handle. The Corvette\u2019s slot is in the intake right behind the door. \n\nTesla is the exception, and you\u2019re being a fanboy making assumptions about the rest of the industry based on your tiny little bubble. Get outside.",
            "The ID.4 has a keyhole under the drivers side handle, and the key is inside the fob.",
            "You're talking about yourself. Phone as a key is just beyond dumb. But you do you",
            "You shouldn't have to partially disassemble your bumper, jump it to open the front trunk, and charge the 12V battery to be able to get in your car.",
            "Have you seen the little stick on bumpers from Ace Hardware they have to put on their steering wheels to find the blinker \u201cbuttons\u201d? \n\nHomie made cars LESS car and that\u2019s absolutely not what anyone wanted.",
            "There is a physical backup from the inside. Also getting in after powerloss just requires a 12V battery.\n\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-34181E3A-B4A7-4658-906A-38C6647B5664.html",

            "They assume emergency responders have ways of opening stuff.\n\nAnyway you apply 12v to the leads that are tucked behind a little hatch on the bumper and it pops the frunk, then you can charge the 12v battery. Not something you would do if there's a baby in danger, you'd break a fucking window like right away, like before someone with tools and shit even has time to get there.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Teslas have cabin overheat protection that has probably saved tens of babies lives at this point.",
            "Right next to your ability to read. This is a problem with modern luxury cars. It's a trade off between security with not letting people in and this far less common situation.\n\nEdit. If you lose your 12v in the wrong situation and you are inside a unlocked car. What do you think happens?",
            "People break the glass to steal stuff out of Teslas all the time...",
            "On the Model 3 and Y, they're only on the front doors.",
            "Oh I\u2019m surprised the ID.3 still has that, a lot of manufacturers don\u2019t make them like that anymore. That was a popular design 10-15 years ago but now many are just doing fobs with no back up key and push to start.",

            "Does that matter",
            "The key is only useful to open the door (singular, only the driver's), the car doesn't have a keyslot for the \"ignition\". On the other hand there's an inductive reader in the cupholder so you can start the car even if the fob has a dead battery.",
            "It's just a \"solution\" looking for a problem, bro. There are plenty of cars with flush door handles that also have keyholes underneath.",

            "No..... that's not how this works.\n\nYou see, normal cars have a physical key. Even inside those electric \"keyless\" fobs. When the car loses power (both hv and 12v), you can always use this physical key to override and get in.\n\nI own a Tesla and an Ioniq 5. Our Ioniq 5 had the notorious 12v failure. Car is sitting dead and I still got in with the physical key.\n\nMy third car is a gas car.
