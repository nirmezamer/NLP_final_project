It happens every now and then, but we have had ***four*** different threads targeted in the past few weeks. Specifically, these threads are being targeted by either bots or dedicated individuals who are mass reporting threads [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/15gloux/chesterzodacom_digital_doctor_scam/), [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17nnv6c/beware_cody_kerns_sergio_troconis_justin/), and [this pair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17exqbt/stocks_scam_using_whatsapp_groups/) of [threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17exf81/stocks_scam_on_whatsapp/) (ETA 11/27: [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/151nyat/beware_of_chester_zoda_course/) is now being brigaded, bringing the total up to 5 threads being targeted). Spammers are reporting these for ridiculous reasons that are unrelated to the content of the posts, including:\n\n* Scambaiting\n* Personal information\n* Spam\n* Off topic\n* Sexual content containing minors\n\nSpammers aren't just targeting the OPs, but also the commenters as well. The brigading will target commenters making general observations, or sharing their personal experience with these businesses.\n\nALL of the individuals named above present themselves as public figures, and have their identities intertwined with their businesses.\n\nI want to outline the following important information to all 600,000 of you in this sub.\n\n1. Brigading **WILL** be addressed with Reddit. We have worked to get these threads reinstated by contacting Mod Support and reporting the abuse of the reporting/voting system. I have checked all of the above threads in incognito mode and they are now visible again to users who are logged out.\n2. If a thread manages to get removed due to this mass reporting, please send the team a Modmail. We will contact Reddit to get your post reinstated, as we can see all of the reports contained in your thread.\n3. If you are shadowbanned by Reddit's automated bots due to mass-reporting of your thread, contact us via Modmail if you suspect this has happened. You can still communicate with us, and we can try to help you. You should also contact Reddit yourself through [this reporting form on ZenDesk.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#:~:text=You%20will%20escalate%20these%20requests,to%20contact%40reddit.com)\n4. If you are harassed by individuals named in your thread, use the reporting form to report the abuse, and contact us directly. If you have screenshots of PMs you have received, please upload them to Imgur and send them to us via Modmail.\n\nI'd also like to outline this brigading has drawn attention to these threads which are several weeks old, and has allowed us to approve comments that were caught by Automod or were automatically removed due to mass reporting.\n\nStay safe, all. Keep sharing your experiences, keep asking your questions about potential scams (whether they have been posted here one time or a million), and always stay vigilant.",

            "Reddit does have some good back-end mechanisms in place to combat spam. Subreddits can turn on filters to automatically queue comments from suspected ban-evasion accounts, has filters that catch spam and automatically remove it, and generally catches recovery scammers who post here pretty quickly; when I get to the queue, see a  recovery scammer comment, and get ready to ban them, 9 times out of 10 Reddit has already suspended the account. When these brigaders are engaging in spammy behaviors, Reddit is catching them. \n\nThe brigading is a pain in the ass and I don't think there's an easy solution. These people generally aren't spamming to the point that the Reddit filters are picking up on it, and they're likely not in the same geographical location so there isn't one or two IP addresses causing trouble.\n\nSo far, we've been able to manage the annoying brigading here ourselves, and Reddit has been pretty good about restoring threads and handling users when we report them for reporting misuse.\n\nBut I do agree, there needs to be more done. At least Reddit isn't like the cesspool Meta/Facebook, where they don't give two shits if scammers/spammers run amok on their platform. I've had Facebook ignore blatant scam reports from me, and it's gotten to the place where they say my only recourse is an ombudsmen group to handle my concern with Facebook for ignoring my reports.",

            "AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the fake/false payment scam. The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. It's also common for scammers to [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam.

            "AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the fake check scam. The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (online or in real life), you deposit a check and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards, Western Union, or cash). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money. The bank will take the initial deposit back , and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

So I found this sponsored site called cerebrum IQ on google and decided to go for it.\n\nAfter taking, it asked for my card to sign me up for a subscription that I could cancel any time. So like a dumba#s I put my card info in and tried to cancel.\n\nThing is I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll actually go through with the cancellation since it just seems like an automated bot just sending me emails without any form of receipt.\n\nDoing some research now, Ive heard stories from people being charged 50 bucks weekly with no way for them to cancel on the site.\n\nAfter trying to contact them through their email, they reached out and said my cancelation supposedly went through and that they are now processing a \"GDPR\" withdrawal which will take a month to finalize. Whatever that means lol.\n\nThing is I really don\u2019t know if the site saved my card info. And if somebody now has my bank account details\u2026\n\nSo what's the safest option for me to do?

Since its a weekend rn I can't contact my bank abt it.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please reach out.\n\nGuess in a way the website really did test my IQ..\n\n**EDIT: To all future \"scam victims\":**\n\nThe site uses deceptive tactics to try to trick you into signing up for an expensive subscription that you were unaware of. Cancelling the subscription is made to be overly difficult and even then they may not follow through with your **cancellation** request.\n\nAs such,\n\nYour best bet is to freeze your bank account immediately.\n\nContact your bank and ask for a new card, your bank will usually get you a new one within a week for dirt cheap (if not for free).\n\nIf you paid with an online service (APPLE PAY, PAYPAL), just google for ways to cancel the transaction from going through. However, you may still want to consider replacing your card nonetheless.\n\nAfter you make sure your financials are no longer tied to the website.

If that's true, you're paying to improve taking their test rather than actually increase your intelligence. Seems pointless. For those wondering, I got a 98 IQ score from Cerebrum IQ.",

        "content": "I got a call a couple of weeks ago.  The number was blocked, but I had just had several minor home emergencies come up and wasn't really thinking and answered it.\n\nIt was my bank (they identified the correct bank, and asked for me by name), saying they had noticed some fraudulent activity on my card.  They wanted confirmation that several charges were fraudulent, so they could lock the card, reverse the charges, and send me a new card.\n\nWell, that's happened at least three times before, though not recently, so nothing unusual.  Just another chore.  They went through about four charges, giving the time, place, and amount.  None were me, of course.  It was hypnotic; going through a bank routine I'd done several times before.  They said they removed the charges.\n\nThen, with all that cleared up, they wanted me to verify I could log in to the mobile app as well.  Which... was odd.  How would stealing my card information have impacted that?  But logging in to the mobile app is safe, so I did.\n\nThey mentioned, without being prompted, that the charges they discussed were already removed and would not show up in the app that I was now looking at.  Except... no bank moves *that* fast.  Least of all mine.  But again, *not* seeing fraudulent charges was no cause for concern, so I dismissed it.  But the two things were starting to wake me up from the \"just following along with the bank to get this cleared up\" hypnotic state.\n\nThen they (after asking if they could send a text) texted me a link so that I could verify the web portal worked too.\n\nI didn't want to go find my super long and random password that is normally managed by an app on my computer that stores things like that securely, and anyway those little red flags were still niggling at my mind and *holy fuck they just asked me to click a link* ***they*** *sent me and enter my bank password.*\n\nWell *that* woke me up once I realized it.  That's when it sunk in what they were doing and what they were after.  Suddenly I realized a bunch of other security things my bank does when I talk to them over the phone (like voice passwords) hadn't happened, and I'd failed to note their absence.\n\nI hung up, and started poking around on my computer.  The bank account website they sent me was convincing - except that only the name and password parts actually worked.  And the source code was full of hidden text to disrupt search engine attempts to locate it.  And it was registered to an empty lot in a nearby city.  And after a failure or two to make sure you're typing your password correctly, it re-directs you to the real thing with a pleasant confirmation message that everything works now.  \n\nThe best I could do is get it taken down, and I'm sure they've put it back up somewhere else.  It was clearly code they'd been using a while despite the site only having been registered for two weeks.  How many people's life savings do you think they stole in two weeks?  I loose sleep over it.\n\nBe careful out there folks.  They could have taken everything I've worked for and everything my family depends on just because I answered the phone while tired and distracted.",

            "Just a heads up to everyone here coming from a banking fraud investigator for a major bank in Canada,  when your bank calls you to verify suspicious charges on your credit card,  the card is already blocked and no other transactions can go through until the agent verifes if you were attempting those transactions. \nThe fraudster will always ask you to either click a link or send you a text with a code to block your card and will always try to implore a sense of urgency to confuse you.\nWhen your actual bank calls, there's absolutely no urgency as the card is locked and will either get unlocked if they verify that you were actually making the transactions or will be replaced if you weren't. \n\nAlso, fraudster can and often spoof your banks phone number and when questioning them if they are truly your bank, they'll point out to look at your phone to acknowledge that it's your banks number and name appearing.\n\nThey may also tell you they'll send you a \"test text message or email to verify that your card is truly locked and the message is actually sent by your bank to ask you if you're making a large purchase at XYZ online store.  The fraudster will tell you to answer YES because it's a test. But it's actually them making a purchase with your card and you're telling the bank that you're accepting the purchase as valid.\n\nAlso, a bank agent when calling you will never ever ask you for any personal information. They are the ones calling you, they've already verified you by calling the verified number on your file.\n\nLastly, when you confront them saying that you have a doubt and prefer calling the bank yourself, they'll try to keep you on the phone by telling you there are long wait times and more fraud can be put on your card while you wait. \nWhile a real bank agent will very politely tell you that they'll leave a note on the account that you were uncomfortable with the outcall and will call back. And they'll tell you to call the number in back of your card. \n\nRemember, if the bank calls you, the card is already locked and no other transactions can be put on it.

            "Same thing happened to my dad. Started off a retired millionaire. Over the course of 6 years, he has sold everything plus ran every credit card or loan imaginable. My uncle covered the cost for him to file bankruptcy, but he immediately did a car title loan right after. He is days away from being evicted, which he should have already been a year ago. His landlord is a family friend, but he has even borrowed from him, and now he's owed thousands in loans and rent. He is always asking me for money or gas all the time. He started working as a janitor cleaning toilets. He thinks he has a girlfriend. When I first found out about the scam, he hadn't been poisoned yet. He still trusted his family and was only in like 250k. I got all the info like you did and started sleuthing. Usually, the scammer will take the last name of one of their full brainwashed demented men. Like my dad. They will insert themselves into their family tree. From that info, you can find previous victims like I did. Reach out to their family, and they will be glad to talk to your dad and try and warn him.  Didn't work for mine, though. I then got the FBI involved, and they told him everything to disprove he had a girlfriend. We changed his number and all that, but he went back to getting scammed. A lot of times, they will use people like my dad to open us bank accounts that they can control. So they receive bank transfers and wash money easier. A lot of banks don't want you wiring a bunch of money to shady accounts. My dad is being scammed out of his health. He won't eat to send them his social security checks. If your dad still has money and is cognizant enough, the best thing to do is hire a prostitute or another female who you can trust to randomly meet him one day and exchange numbers. Pay her to go on a date or whatever, but her story needs to be that she will be leaving the country soon.  You need to scam save your dad with something they can't offer, a real woman who can FaceTime or he can meet a few times. She needs to be jealous and get extremely mad if she thinks he is talking to his \"ex\". The more you fight, the more they will isolate your dad from you. Eventually, he will be a shell and could cost him his life. It's crazy, but had I paid a prostitute right from the jump, I could have saved years off his life and not see my dad homeless. You have to think like a scammer in order to save him. Your dad prob got on match.com because he was lonely, he needs that void filled first. someone who can retrain his brain away from the scammers.

            "Hi /u/rpsls, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.\n\n[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \\\"recovery agents\\\" or hackers.\n\nWhen they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.\n\nIf you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.\n\nRemember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The apps were legitimate bitcoin trading apps.

It went through my ISP and landed on coinbase's website.\n\nShe said she was going to show me how to cash out the next day after I \"had a 39% gain on my $100 investment\"\n\nI thought what the hell, it looks self explanatory enough, I'll cash out myself. And that's where the trouble lies, the wallet gives you errors when trying to send bitcoin. \n\nBut apparently if you let them \"show you how to do it\" they'll allow you to actually withdraw your money by granting you access or whatever, so now you trust them and throw all your money in.\n\nGuys, this isn't your regular scammers.

The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \\\"recovery agents\\\" or hackers.\n\nWhen they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.\n\nIf you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.\n\nRemember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.\n\nThe scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).\n\nEventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.\n\nIf you know someone involved in a pig butchering scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning to help them understand what's going on: https://youtu.be/vu-Y1h9rTUs -\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What they did was change his money into crypto tokens and transfer those to one of their wallets. At the time I saw all this, the money was still there. They never touched it. \n\nSo we went to the police with all the info and they actually traced the funds along the block chain until it reached a \u00e4n official exchange. They didn\u2019t give us much hope, but they said they might get the exchange to block the tokens before they can be exchanged into real money and then disappear. \n\nThose scammers have to exchange it into real money at some point and they have to use a regulated exchange for that. It\u2019s not a sure thing and it might take some time, but at least there is a slim chance to get luckily. \n\nI feel for you, though. I\u2019m so angry at those low life scum assholes.

The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \\\"recovery agents\\\" or hackers.\n\nWhen they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.\n\nIf you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.\n\nRemember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I thought it was new neighbors getting their address confused. However, it's happened 8 times and has already been paid for when we've asked (and no, the drivers would not just give me free food - I asked on the 7th and 8th times because I was starting to get pissed lol). One driver said that the caller said his house was in my backyard. There is no house there. I live in a single family home. This is also creepy because the delivery driver was walking around my backyard looking for the house, which lured me outside to talk to him. I will no longer be answering the door and will be speaking through my doorbell camera.\n\nI also learned from other neighbors that those new neighbors who I thought were getting confused are out of town, so it can't be them. Those are also the only 2 neighbors who could possibly be construed as living behind my house the way the street is laid out. When I explain the situation to the drivers, they call the number that ordered it, but they never answer. It actually happened twice from the same restaurant within 20 minutes.\n\nHere's where I messed up. Thinking it was new neighbors, I texted the number from the receipt and told them to please update their address in their ordering app. They didn't respond, and now I'm realizing that they have my address and now my phone number. Maybe that's what they were trying to get the whole time to steal my identity. That was dumb. Another concern is maybe they're casing my house to find out when I'm home. At first I thought that was unlikely since the orders have already been paid for, but they could be using stolen credit cards.\n\nI did some internet sleuthing that I learned from Catfish and found two people tied to that number (one is a man tied to that number. An email for a woman was also tied to that number). The address listed is on the other side of the metro 30 miles away, so there's no way they are ordering food in my neighborhood to be delivered to their house. I found both people on Facebook, and they are Facebook friends with each other, so I'm pretty sure it's them.\n\nAny ideas on how to get this to stop and what precautions I should take? I will work on freezing my credit this weekend and changed my Google password already. I also blocked those two people on Facebook so I won't show up on people they may know and give them more info about my identity. Should I go to the police? Any advice is appreciated. TIA.\n\n",

            "This is what I had hoped originally.",
            "I do think it\u2019s a stolen credit card scheme at this point. I\u2019d be so pissed if my address got banned from food delivery because I order too.",
            "All these thoughts crossed through my head, and I like the theory that it\u2019s just someone far away testing out credit cards to see if they work. I\u2019m in no legal matter, and I have no reason to believe I\u2019ll get served. But still the random people showing up at my door is unsettling, so I\u2019ll only answer through the doorbell if at all from now on.",
            "Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done every time. I don\u2019t want to involve myself in whatever is going on",
            "I wouldn\u2019t mind that so much if the drivers actually let me keep the food lol.",
            "Yeah, casing the house is what I was worried about",
            "Let\u2019s find out. Keep sending it lol. I\u2019ve always rejected the deliveries, but now I\u2019ll just accept them I guess",
            "Yes, it doesn't look like it's anything for you to be worried about.\u00a0",
            "Till the law comes knocking at your door over stolen cards.",
            "That\u2019s totally what I think now, so I feel better",
            "Maybe they\u2019re not sure how high the credit card limit is and are trying for smaller transactions?",
            "That\u2019s so bizarre. What do they gain from doing this, assuming it\u2019s not accidental? Even if it\u2019s paid from stolen credit cards, they don\u2019t actually benefit from this whatsoever.",
            "It\u2019s when someone secretly lives at your place without your knowledge. Like in the attic or some space that is rarely used.\u00a0",
            "Have you seen the movie Parasite?",
            "Do you have a sister somewhere between the ages of 30 and 50 currently able to locomote within the West Coast of Florida, and does she like Pizza? I might try the same thing.",
            "Why would they not let you keep it? It's your address!",
            "Perhaps, but what can OP do about that?\n\n\u201cHello. Police? Someone keeps ordering a sausage and egg McMuffin meal for me.\u201d",
            "Go about your day's activities. It's nothing you should be fret about.\u00a0",
            "That's the usual M.O. Small transaction to test the card, large tranaction to steal something worthwhile. But this pattern is a red flag to cc companies; we've gotten calls from fraud departments confirming we were NOT buying plane tickets to Tahiti (or whatever -- we weren't) and explaining there was a prior ten-dollar transaction, and that combo aroused their computers' suspicions.\n\nMaybe the food-order test transaction is an attempt to stay under the cc company's early-warning radar.",
            "I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re casing my house to see when I\u2019m home or if they were waiting for me to text them, and now they have my address and number to steal my identity. Idk if I\u2019m being paranoid, but it\u2019s just so bizarre.",
            "This sounds like a thing to be worried about. I've never thought about it before. Thanks for mentioning it.\u00a0",
            "I told them I didn\u2019t order it, but maybe next time I\u2019ll just say thanks and keep it lol. They were worried about trying to deliver it to the right person and were calling them.",
            "Yeah I started to think they were testing the limits when they sent a huge order and then sent a small order from the same place within 15 minutes. Seems it would be the other way around, but maybe the orders went here backwards. Oh well. I\u2019m over it.",
            "Can you change your phone number? If you are that worried. Might be worth it. And more cameras/more home security prob worth the peace of mind, like the other person said.\n\nMake sure locks are good and windows secure. My apt has bars on my windows that are accessible by a porch or something because of where I live, but it is not very nice aesthetically (i cover the bars with nice looking curtains).\n\nVery weird though, be safe",
            "Have you considered posting on RBI ? I\u2019m wondering if this is appropriate for that subreddit.",
            "Sounds suspicious. I've never had any food delivery in my life where the driver wanted to verify who I was. Sounds sketchy. You may want to contact police. Also, if you're a woman, then it's even more likely it's a stalker who is playing games.",
            "Is that like a Reddit FBI? I did some digging on the phone number but could use some real sleuths!",
            "They weren\u2019t actually trying to verify my identity. I voluntarily told them I didn\u2019t order it, so they were like oh shit, well we should figure out who did so we can deliver it. But stalkers and other creepy shit have come to mind.",
            "Door dash attempts to verify, but it really depends on the driver",
            "Yeah, pretty much. Check out the rules for their subreddit and see if it would apply to your situation.",
            "Oh, makes sense.",
            "Dominos driver here. If the person at the door said they didn't order the food, we call the number on the receipt. If no answer and the person said they don't want it, back to the store it goes. \n\nOn occasion it will be a friend ordering a surprise meal for a friend, but we generally get a heads up on those."
