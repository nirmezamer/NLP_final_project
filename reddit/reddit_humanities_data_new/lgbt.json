            "I know my comment will probably be at the bottom as time past by, but thank you for making this thread. \n\nAs someone who is unfortunately in FL and done a semester abroad in Sydney, Australia, the climate of Florida and Australia, is completely different than what I used to be dealing with for the past few years in FL. The US scares me more and more as time past by, and idk how it got so badly (more than usual, specifically for LGBTQIA+ Rights) in terms of bills passed and hatred that is not only promoting by news stations and social media but the misinformation that may or may not effected people's close relationships with family, friends, loved ones and their communities. \n\nThe news of Anti LGBTQIA+ Bills makes me heavily cautious for the future and our safety, BUT, This is a GOOD resource in creating this thread for people who lived in America or those in other countries following US news that can still be informed in real time without bringing the energy towards the rest of the subreddit (with exception of huge development which is TBD). I will be following this thread and hopeful of some positive news that can surprised us between now and in the future. \n\nMost likely, we all are gonna be watching closely for the US November 2024 Election which everyone's mind is towards the possibility of Project 2025 starting up IF Trump is re elected again, which is scary thought to think, however, the best thing that ANYONE can do currently is to make a plan to VOTE. \n\nCheck your registration status and update any information IF you're ELIGIBLE to vote within your local district and states website. Make a habit of doing so when your information needs to be updated/according to your states voting regulations that may says you need to do for every cycle. DO NOT ONLY VOTE when it's the Presidential Elections BUT make the TIME to do so CONSISTENTLY within your LOCAL COUNTIES and STATES. The politicians we have in the House and Senate effects on what type of policies and other federal bills gets viewed and have attention towards. DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THE CANDIDATES, DO NOT PICK BLINDLY since then you be wasting your vote and you don't want that. \n\nEVERY SINGLE VOTE MATTERS, and we all need to be properly represented for changes to happen and that can't happen if we throw in the towel. Some things are out of our control such as the Current Supreme Court Justice which is a completely different story or other things that would take away the theme of LGBT subreddit (no need to list them & being vague for that reason) HOWEVER, Voting is pretty much the ONLY thing we can attempt to do via Mail in or by in person without putting ourselves in Danger by advocating or protesting. \n\nThe November 2024 Election will have effects on a global scale whatever we want to acknowledge it or not. It wouldn't be just a USA problem but it will have the potential of giving a green light to politicians in proposing other copy cat/similar policies or bills to pass in their own countries (such as Alberta, Canada) within the LGBTQIA+ Community or have unrepairable results of other global/national issues beyond what we can currently speculate. \n\nDo your part (IF ELIGIBLE) to VOTE and if you can't, that's cool, but try to start thinking of how your current states law is for LGBTQIA+ and think of survival, in other words, of alternative plans. If you are a LGBTQIA+ Youth or a Young Adult that wants to go into university or trade school, Start looking up places that will not limit your rights but can also give out federal aid or scholarships for you to attend. Check out other subreddits such as Student Loans, or your potential uni state and college to get more information beyond what you may learn online thru research. Determine if the amount of loans throughout the duration of your program (including dorms or off campus accomodations if escaping from bad living situations) is acceptable for your career paths. Don't go hundreds of thousands in debt if you not gonna see pay offs from it, and you can figure that out through other subreddits like Career Guidance, Career Advice, and potentially more.\n\nFor LGBTQIA+ Adults, IF you are capable of moving states without having to deal with financial, family obligations, work & career opportunities or other similar circumstances, then that would be suggested IF the state you live in is bad or on the verge to be down the toilet. But moving is difficult and expensive, so I suggest during a major pros/cons before doing so since it's not a decision to make easily especially if you have dependents, and others to consider within your decision but not everyone has that ability to do so unfortunately (I certainly can't for at least a few more years) and if you decide to stay in your state, do what you can to be safe that should be everyone's priority no matter what decisions they are making related to being apart of the LGBTQIA+ Community.\n\nAnyways, once again thank you Mods for creating this thread and I hope my comments can help a couple of users be motivated to vote, keep in mind their options for safety and potentially career advancement in a different state (if theirs are not good) and just overall being mindful of the current regulations without being overwhelmed until we have more concrete information as time gets closer for the November Election.",

            "Project 2025: What is to be done, and how we can combat it\n\nSo I wanted to make this post because I keep seeing more and more posts concerned about this. This is EXTREMELY important and everyone, even those outside the US, need to know what this is about. For those who are unaware: Project 2025 is essentially a planned fascist takeover of the US, starting with Trump winning the 2024 election. \n\nWhat this entails is terrifying to say the least. The existence of queer people (trans people in particular) is completely outlawed, all of us can be tried and imprisoned in *CONCENTRATION CAMPS* for the crime of existing. And this is only a small part of the larger plan, queer people may be the main targets, but this affects everyone. This is literally the rise of the Nazis, only in the US rather than Germany.\n\nAll of us are scared, and rightfully so. We all know something needs to be done, but what is it exactly? The easiest and most obvious solution is to vote for the democrats in this election. But this doesn't just make the fascists magically disappear, they will try again in 4 more years if they fail, the root cause of the rise of fascism will not ever be addressed by the democrats, as they are merely one side of the same coin. This will delay the inevitable rise of fascism, but this delay allows us to prepare.\n\nAnd what do I mean by prepare? I mean arm yourselves, learn how to shoot, educate those around you, and most of all do not sugar coat a single bit of this. Our community is one part of the larger class conflict inherent in this crisis. Moderate politics are done for, the only ones providing a long term solution to the far right is the far left. The communists, the socialists, etc. and they (along with the entire revolutionary proletariat) are your greatest allies. \n\nIt is time to wake up, this isn't democrats vs republicans, this is the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, and there is no easy way out of this. It is time to put an end to this once and for all, and ensure that fascism never gets to rear its ugly head ever again.

It's interesting because the LGBT community embodies everything I love about anti establishment, raging against the machine and bucking the system.

Someone who spends their entire time seeking out the vilest transphobia, homophobia and hate they can, only to repost it to your timeline to 'dunk' on or disprove it or whatever, you shouldn't follow or engage with them. Even if you think it's the right thing to do, even if you like them, even if it feels akward to do it, unfollow, block, mute etc. \n\nWith that out of the way, the thing you can do, is built local and remote community. Join discord servers, get to know LGBT people locally, work up to hosting or attending social events if you feel able. Having people around with different skills, having a support structure, it is something that can really help when you feel bad. It can really help you feel good and hopeful.\n\nOn a larger scale, the LGBT community has survived and thrived though worse.

            "For starters, the if you are talking about the American Equality Act, it hasn\u2019t passed and given the current anti-queer political movement, aimed particularly at us trans people, I would not expect legislation like the Equality Act to actually pass for at least another decade. If you are talking about the British Equality Act, it is actively being taken apart to remove protections for trans people that were included in the original law passed in 2010. So the goal is not achieved and the fight is not over and at least for those of us on the inside (particularly for us trans people, I believe) right now the outlook on our rights looks darker than it has appeared since at least the so-called \u201ctrans tipping point\u201d of 2014. Truthfully it\u2019s a little bizarre to see an ally with the belief that \u201cthe goal is achieved and the fight is over,\u201d even with the caveat of your \u201cbut is it?\u201d because from the inside things genuinely haven\u2019t looked this negative since I started transitioning about 5 years ago. I don\u2019t mean this as criticism, but instead as just a reflection of my realization that my trans positionality makes me particularly sensitive to the changing climate surrounding trans issues in ways that even allies can\u2019t relate.\n\nPerhaps the best thing you as a cishet ally can do is educate your family and friends on trans issues. To help educate you probably need to do more research, media made by trans people like Whipping Girl by Julia Serrano or Disclosure by Laverne Cox are interesting places to start. From there checking in monthly or even weekly with the massive influx of anti-queer laws being passed (and officially enacted into law, unlike the only introduced Equality Act) all around the country could help give you ideas for next moves, like perhaps reaching out to elected officials or helping queer people organize protests. To be quite frank, as we continue to take losses in the trans rights political game, the rights of the other LGBT+ communities are increasingly in peril, as well as the rights of other marginalized groups. All of these political movements are being targeted by the same strain of (pseudo?)fascism we call Trumpism here in America, but this reactionary movement is global so if you are located outside of America take my advice but move it to your own politicians. \n\nAlso, should Trump get re-elected there is a very real chance that the decline of queer rights will only accelerate as democracy itself quite possibly ends in America\u2014a goal that American conservatives are increasingly speaking openly about. Even though the general political machine is faulty, problematic, and borderline rigged by the Electoral College, anything you can do to keep Trump out of office is likely the most pressing work you can do to be a \u201cgood ally.\u201d Again, same can likely be applied to your own political machine if from another country\u2014eg, getting Tories out in Britain or keeping the worst of the worst out of politics if in Australia in order to avoid going down the same path of queer scapegoating other Anglophone countries have taken. I know you said you aren\u2019t a fan of the system, but culture comes downstream from the law and our most obvious impact on the law as citizens in relatively democratic countries comes from the election process\u2014this doesn\u2019t mean stop your activism at electioneering but it does mean that the most direct political impacts can be made through that process.",

Biden is choosing this year, of ALL years, to alienate his voters and give Trump a fighting chance. So, I'm afraid that a Trump presidency isn't unlikely. Meaning, all of us being GENOCIDED, isn't unlikely. And that makes it really fucking hard to want to continue being alive.\n\nI guess it doesn't help that I also have OCD. It just amplifies my fears, and makes it hard to believe any time someone actually says it ISN'T likely.\n\nObviously I'm gonna vote, but I'm in a red state so I don't know how much that'll really matter.\n\nGenuinely, this feels like the last year I'm going to live. How did things GET this fucking bad.",

The more I watch his videos he posts the more you understand his view. And I will take my chances I hate trump now and america can use a new president to be fair. Strictly my opinion and im sure we all have one.",
            "Things got like this because Republicans got into all the trifecta supermajority without notice and this is all political motivated primarily to get votes of bigot evangelicals a rather large demographic. For sure it's very well thought out but it's just too over the top I think even for evangelicals.. but still... \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\n\nAnd not it's not the last year you're going to be alive trust me unless you let it be the last. The affect of hatred is pure poison for sure and that's what we all feel. I have had some difficulty with just knowing I'm hated some suicidal ideation last couple years.  But somehow I have been able to turn it into rage and just focus back on them and countering the hatred however I can.. That usually involves engaging trolls who are invariably really low IQ types. My goal was simply to make them look stupid and then leave... There isn't much else I can do really. I do live in a state that is trifecta red bigot also and our governor Kim Reynolds is a DeSantis wannabe who has wasted all her time on the culture wars and accomplished nothing else I don't see her being reelected. Truth is prosperity increases wherever Republicans aren't and it wasn't always like that but most sane people can see that. \n\nI have some friends I work with that are life long republican and are appalled with what the Republican party has become and quietly will vote Democrat again. That's probably what happened last time. My grandmother was Republican and she never thought the way these ones do. They aren't all the maga types and can't really blame them for just quietly voting against their own party seeing the far right attacks anyone who disagree with them in true bully fashion. It's amazing the 3rd grade mentality of the typical maga moron. \n\nI really think they have once again picked the wrong hill to die on. Most people in the country can see they we were here for decades and for there to suddenly be some LGBTQ agenda to make everyone queer is absurd to any rational human. Everything they say has been said before they just parrot the same old nonesense that only really stupid narrow minded people buy intoc these days. \n\nAll the anti trans conspiracy theories like hormones being given to children like candy and \"butchering\"  them and danger from trans woman using the correct bathroom or locker is all very easily debunked even logically it makes no sense. The fact that they keep parrot this stuff went actually lie to create laws just destroy their credibility because most Republicans people (not the politicians) are basically honest people so that kind of dishonesty is obviously a stain. \n\nBut for sure they will increase their efforts leading up to the election if we know wtf is going on and their real motives it makes it easier to let it go a little, at least for me it does.. \n\nI'm trying to hopefully help you see some positive things and not doom. And there are times where we just have to turn it off it takes practice but you can do it too.  \n\nIf ever you need to vent I'm all ears. \n\n\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",
            "i dont have anything to say to help, but i just wanted to let you know youre not alone. I resonate with these feelings a lot too. \ud83e\udec2 but i agree with you about the voting and hoping part, i like what you said there",
            "I used to not care as much that I was hated either, but dealing with hate and dealing with the fact that your existence is illegal and they can just bust down your door and arrest you are two totally different things. And I still don't know the extent of just how illegal it'll be. Like, could I get arrested just for talking about my transness on Discord with a friend? I just don't know the extent of how bad it's gonna be. But with a full on right-wing dictatorship run by the most evil people in the country? It's definitely gonna be really bad I'd imagine.\n\nThere are definitely reasons to be hopeful though. Just the other day I used all the resources my mom showed me to help someone else who was feeling suicidal because of these right wing freaks. And in doing so I also learned that a whole 40% of Republicans are willing to vote against Trump. 40% of your own side not voting for you is bloody HUGE. That's just HUGE.\n\nBut then I go onto threads that discuss Project 2025 and my mood is dampened again by all the people saying we're just fucked if Trump wins, game over, ect.\n\nThat's why I'm just trying to block it out now, I think about it enough. It's on my mind 24/7 and that's not healthy. If I don't try to stay optimistic I'll just go insane, but it's so damn hard to stay optimistic with all the things people are saying.\n\nIt does help that one of the only people telling me it WON'T happen is someone that keeps up with politics, though. Hell, my mom even met Obama in person once. So when she says it won't happen and that things will most likely be okay, it's more comforting coming from her because she probably knows what she's talking about. So I'm making an effort to stick to what SHE says, and not what people on the internet are saying.\n\nAnd another thing she says is that a lot of the times, politicians, especially Republicans, do things KNOWING damn well that they won't actually work out, just for the sake of scaring people and distracting from what's going on. And, given how evil and snakey these people are, I fully believe that. That definitely sounds like something these people would do.\n\nReally, I think the OCD is just what makes this as bad for me as it is.  \nOCD is a true nightmare to live with and it really doesn't help you in the case of scary news.\n\nBelieve me, they don't call it 'OBSESSIVE' compulsive disorder for nothing. It's hard not to obsess over these things, and when you obsess over them it becomes so much worse.",

            "I really like your hair c:",

            "Pretty shitty when you don't think a parent is a parent. Glad they made a somewhat positive decision. But it is pathetic that it wasn't a common sense thing already. Still a let down that they didn't recognise her as a mother though.",
            "A comment from og thread:\n\n\nPlease note that this decision by the court REFUSED the transgender woman's request to be recognized as the child's \"mother\". It forced her to be recognized as the \"father\", otherwise the child would not get benefits.  \n  \nThis was not what the parent wanted, and is the default way in cases like this as Japan does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nSocial media is strange. Another thread about this exact case framed it as \"court refuses to recognize transgender woman as the mother\", and people were criticizing Japan as being backward.\n\nBut in this thread, they are getting praise...?",
            "Not a great thing, the court official recognized her as misgendered against her wishes",
            "Maybe someone can fill me in on this, because I was under the impression that if you want to change your gender marker in Japan you need to be unmarried and have no children under 18. The article says she changed her gender marker soon *after* the birth of her first daughter, a daughter which she was apparently recognized as the \"father\" of at that time. Did the law change at some point or what's going on here?",
            "Here\u2019s the full article for context:\n\n\u201cJapan's top court on Friday recognized a transgender woman as the \"father\" of her 3-year-old daughter conceived using her frozen sperm and born to her female partner after legally transitioning, in the first such ruling.\n\nScrapping a high court ruling, the Supreme Court recognized the parent-child relationship of the woman in her 40s, who was assigned male at birth and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2018, and her second daughter, born in 2020, using sperm preserved before her transition.\n\n\"If a child cannot seek recognition because of a gender change, he or she cannot receive support as a dependent or become an heir. This is clearly contrary to the child's welfare and interests,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe Tokyo High Court ruling in August 2022 said the trans woman can only be recognized as the parent to her first daughter born before the legal gender change, but not after, resulting in different parent-child relationship statuses for the daughters.\n\nThe decision came despite both children being confirmed as biological children of the woman and her partner through DNA tests.\n\nThe woman applied for recognition as a parent of two daughters at a local government after switching from male to female in 2018 between the two births but was rejected.\n\nThe family then sought a legal remedy, filing a lawsuit with a Tokyo Family Court in 2021, but the court did not recognize the woman as a parent for both daughters.\n\nJapan does not recognize same-sex marriage. The country's law on gender dysphoria requires surgery to remove a person's reproductive capabilities to register a gender change, but a top court decision in 2023 said that was unconstitutional.\u201d",
            "Did they get it right though? They\u2019re recognising her as the child\u2019s father, and not mother like she\u2019d petitioned. \n\nIt\u2019s better than having no legal relationship to her kids, but it still means it is impossible for Japanese kids to have more than one legal parent sharing a gender.",
            "People don't read past the headlines internet 101. Also people like Japan until they remember it's conservative.",
            "Probably a result of Japans koseki system being outdated as fuck as it still is not possible for same sex couples to be in it. Japan is one of those countries where it truly baffles me that its not legal yet to be in a queer marriage.",
            "She's still legally the child's father",
            ">The country's law on gender dysphoria requires surgery to remove a person's reproductive capabilities to register a gender change  \\[...\\]\n\nAnd that's textbook eugenics. Mind you, Finland had the same requirement until last year, much like equal marriage rights started to be rolled out, with some earlier exceptions, only around ten years ago, so it's not like Japan's that much behind countries generally seen as progressive. It's still eugenics, though.",
            "I agree with you of coarse as they absolutely should have recognised the parent as a mother. But the result is still a baby step forward rather than backward. Progress is progress.",
            "That's not what I'm talking about. She had a child prior to changing her gender marker and another child after, but as far as I know you're not supposed to be able to change your gender marker if you have a child."
