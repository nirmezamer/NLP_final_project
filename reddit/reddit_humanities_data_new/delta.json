            "It is unlikely that he is a legal service animal but he looks like such a good boy that pets and ear scratches would be a perk of sharing a row with him. And he looks a little scared, so extra points for comforting one of God\u2019s Creatures, whether Great or Small.",
            "Even if it is a 100% legitimate service animal, it\u2019s usually a very big no-no to have their SD come up to anybody on a flight, a restaurant, or any place else they\u2019re required to be in their best behavior. \n\nNow sure, sometimes you\u2019re walking through the store and someone surprises you and immediately goes to pet the dog and you roll with it instead of dressing them down in public for disregarding the best that says \u201cIGNORE ME IM WORKING\u201d and \u201cSERVICE DOG, DO NOT PET\u201d but I digress.\n\nBut also chances are it probably isn\u2019t legit or the dog is improperly trained and/or the owner is not properly trained or stupid.",
            "Given the number of animals who are killed by neglect or depressurization or left in the sun on the tarmac when they travel in the cargo hold of the airplane, if I absolutely HAD to fly with my dog somewhere, he would be in the cabin with me. \nBut I would never make him fly just for fun. It\u2019s way too stressful.",
            "id be stoked to have that as a travelling neighbor haha",
            "I have a severe allergy to dogs that when combined with my asthma leads me to having severe asthma attacks. The aftereffects of which can last days and leave me unable to walk further than a few meters before needing to sit down to take a break and breathe. You can imagine how inconvenient that would be in an airport.\n\nThis is clearly not a service animal and sitting beside it would be a nightmare scenario for me. Is it too much to ask that dog owners be a little considerate and stop pretending that their pet is a service animal?\n\nEdit: I would like to add that I really love dogs, it's just that my body and brain can't seem to agree on how they feel about them.",
            "That is ridiculous.",
            "Look, I have 3 dogs but it\u2019s getting ridiculous on planes now. Hire a dog sitter like the rest of us. Now people are bringing cats. How about those of us with allergies? All of this service dog/emotional support animal stuff is a crock. 95% are fake but everyone is to scared of backlash to say anything.",
            "I\u2019m sorry - it doesn\u2019t matter how cute he is that is entirely unacceptable. My mom is terrified of dogs and she would lose her shit if some dog popped up on her lap mid flight. There are rules for a reason",
            "My neighbor on my last flight had two itty bitty chihuahuas in a pet carrier he brought on our flight. They were perfectly well behaved and only came out when their owner made sure I was ok with it.\n\nYour neighbor sucks.",

            "My partner and I did this with our therapy dog a few years back. We don't have any special needs of our own and didnt claim to, but the dog is trained and certified for comforting vulnerable populations. The airline accepts this as a good enough reason to rent a seat to the dog.",

            "That's a heeler.  Definitely not a service dog, but great dogs nonetheless.\n\nHope you had a pleasant experience nonetheless.  These dogs are bred for working and need tons of exercise.  Most are very smart, well behaved, and bonded to their humans.",

            "I\u2019d rather have this guy! Over the sick Asian gentleman who sat beside me from Narita to EWR, coughing and throwing up in the bag and asking for hot water all night. Felt terrible for him, but please man. Stay home!",
            "Cute guy but I agree this is not cool. I flew home once with a bomb-sniffing lab. He was an incredibly good boy and the owner/handler got the bulwark seat and he just curled up at his feet. But he also took up foot room from the others in that row. \n\nHonest question though: if I fly say to Europe and want to take my dog do I have to crate him in the cargo area of the plane?! We are planning a month stay in a couple of years and I was trying to imagine how that would go.",
            "Such a sweet baby. I wish there were better options for people who need to fly with pets. Putting them in cargo is so dangerous. That new dog airline is a cool idea but it\u2019s $$$$$.",
            "Leave your damned dog at home or put it in cargo.  .  Emotional support\u2026. People need to heavy up.  A lot of dogs can\u2019t stand the changing pressure and will whine and cry for the flight.  Much like when I hear an infant screaming a plane \u2026. It\u2019s almost always caused by air pressure change.  I see people on here saying their dog would do fine except it would try to climb on laps and get kisses.  If it\u2019s truly a service dog and trained right it should ignore anyone but their master.",

            "I am surprised someone hasn\u2019t started an airline that caters to people who want to fly with their dogs.  I\u2019m not talking about that dumb super expensive one that is for rich people (Bark Air).  I mean the ability to purchase a seat for your dog and have other dog lovers on the flight.  We get pet sitters because I think it would be too traumatic and stressful for our dog to fly underneath (even with anxiety meds).  Or, we just drive even if it\u2019s 1000 miles.  If I could buy a seat for my dog, I would. (for the record, my dog hasn\u2019t flown, and I haven\u2019t gotten papers for him from Dr. Internet)\n\nEdited to say I would be thrilled to be next to a sweet dog on a flight, if I got to pet it.  The dog in this pic looks really sweet and cute.",

            "Honestly, I have no problem if they are well behaved. Since delta is draconian about transporting pets (they don\u2019t allow in cargo either, unless military), I am fine with people trying to pass them. Maybe delta should also transport pets in cargo like other airlines.",

            "That looks like a very sweet pup!\n\nThey should not have been in this situation, however.\n\nIf I were in your shoes or within a few rows I would have been laid up with respiratory distress for days after. I know folks with phobias who would have been very upset.\n\nEven people who love dogs or \u201cwould rather sit next to a doggo than a stinky human, I hate people lol\u201d have to understand on some level why this is a problem\u2026 right?",

            "Why is everyone that makes positive comments about how much they like the dog getting downvoted? JFC some Delta passenger must really hate animals. Y\u2019all need to check yourselves. Our human species is pretty deplorable. I said what I said. Down vote me 1000 times. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really disgusted by this thread.",

            "Man a lady brought a nice looking dog and my wife freaked out.  Dominicans from the DR think they are disgusting so I offered to trade seats with her.  She said no and had another lady trade with her so I couldn't sit and play with the dog and \"mess up\" my clothes.\n\nI was so disappointed.",
            "Have a feeling you called the dog over \ud83d\ude18 considering how well behaved and relaxed he looks at window seat under his Pa. Good on owner for first class seat \u2014 more room for the dog to lie down with less distraction as economy serves for dogs.",

            "A service animal would not jump up like that licking.  This is either someone faking that it is a service animal to get it to be able to fly in the main cabin or it's just an ESA which is not covered under the ADA.",

I wouldn't do that to my dog because I know 1) Our cover would be blown immediately because he would go up to everyone asking for pets and giving kisses, and 2) it would be a stressful environment for him since he's not trained for it.\n\nThat said, I would still take most dogs being next to me on a flight than some of these kids...and adults.",
            "Just a reminder to everyone as well (I\u2019m prepared for the downvotes, so bring them). \n\n*You* as a passenger can ask any questions you want of a \u201cservice\u201d dog owner!  \n\nYou can, for example, ask:\n\nWhat the dog is trained to do. \n\nWhat training the owner has done to make sure the dog doesn\u2019t bite and/or use the bathroom. \n\nWhat the name of the trainer is.\n\nThe last time the dog was de-flea-ed. \n\nWho did the service?\n\nWould you mind moving seats since I do not like dogs?\n\nDo you mind if I hiss at your dog to establish the hierarchy of this flight?\n\nThe dog owner can of course say no or ignore any of these questions, but you do not need to silently accept this the way regulated airline employees do.",

Ohhhh but both dogs were SuCh GOOD BoYssss and had NEvER done ANYyyyything like that before \ud83d\ude44\n\nLook, I love dogs. I do. They're better than all of us humans. I'm severely allergic to them, so OP's  scenario would be pretty bad for me even with the precautions I take for flight \"just in case\". But some owners are downright delusional, which makes things pretty unsafe. And delusion and entitlement go pretty hand in hand. It's lucky that this dog seemed friendly and nothing set it off, and lucky that OP was fine with the interaction. But I'm really tired of the delusion and entitlement especially at 30,000ft.",

I get the same feeling that I did when I was attacked whenever I see a bigger dog (I actually own a very small poodle).  I hate it, and have tried to push through, but I\u2019m not sure how I would react to being in such closed quarters as a plane! PTSD sucks.  \n\nThat dog looks sweet though. \n\nPeople have to remember that there might be people like me that have had a traumatic dog experience\u2026.or God forbid, just not like them.",
            "I flew with my certified therapy dog (he regularly visited hospitals and other vulnerable settings regularly) a few years ago. The airline required documentation from the certifying abency. They also did a great job of considering other people. They boarded us first and seated us in the very back. The attendants checked with our neighbours before they got to their seat. We disembarked last. Nobody was surprised, and anyone uncomfortable would have had a chance to swap with someone who wanted to cuddle with a retreiver on their flight. We were even sat downstream in the airflow, where risk of allergens is minimized.\n\nThese things can be managed well. It's hard for a fellow passenger to know, except that OP seems not to have been checked for compatibility with dogs.",

After sitting on the plane at the gate for about 30 minutes for a \u201croutine\u201d engineering inspection, the captain announced the flight was cancelled. A new part needed to be shipped from the UK. This was a full flight. \n\nVirgin handed out papers saying we\u2019d be rebooked within the next 3 hours for another flight. I needed to be in London to catch a connecting flight to Scotland on another airline tomorrow morning. The uncertainty in Virgin\u2019s piece of paper was too much for me.\n\nI hopped on the phone immediately with Delta. The first agent I talked was super nice, but couldn\u2019t get me anything until the 12-15 hours later. I would definitely miss my connecting flight. At first, I thought this is my fate, and I decided to wait for Virgin\u2019s rebooking. \n\nBut, I saw there was a direct tonight from JFK to Edinburgh tonight, so I figured I\u2019d roll the dice and ask to get on it even though, in Delta\u2019s view, London was my final destination. \n\nI called back Delta, and I explained the situation to the agent (without mentioning Scotland). She looked through all the flights to LHR, and she could not find anything to get me to London to make my next flight. Then, I asked, \u201cLondon is not my final destination, and I\u2019m really trying to get to Edinburgh by tomorrow afternoon. Is there any possibility that I can be rebooked on that direct flight tonight to Edinburgh?\u201d\n\nShe told me to hold, and she would look. She came back, and said, \u201cSir, you reservation has been updated, and you are now on the flight to Scotland tonight. Would you like an aisle or window seat?\u201d\n\nI was stoked and beyond thankful, but it was followed with a little hitch. Virgin hadn\u2019t released my booking back to Delta, so while had a reservation, I couldn\u2019t get a boarding pass. I saw Edinburgh in my itinerary for the day in the Delta app, but I couldn\u2019t check-in. The super friendly agent patched me through to Delta\u2019s \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d to resolve the situation. \n\nI was having this entire conversation at Gate A5. While I was on hold with \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d, I had time to go retrieve my checked bag from domestic arrivals in T4 and walk to the Sky Priority check in counter. \n\nI met Stella at the Delta check-in counter. Explained to her the situation, and she took over. She said I\u2019m going to do my best to get this settled for you. She got on the phone, while I was still on hold with \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d and got it done. She got me a boarding pass and she sent me on my way. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to post this until I was wheels up, but I\u2019m on my way to Scotland now over the Atlantic on schedule thanks to a really awesome Delta phone rep and Stella at the Sky Priority check-in at JFK.

        "content": "On a flight from ATL to Dayton last week, I saw an economy passenger try to sneak her bag into the first class overhead bin space.\n\nTo her credit, first class was full, but there was still bin space. The attendant pulled her bag out, gave it back to the passenger and told her to take it back to her row and find space there. \n\nNo one in first class complained. I did hear the attendant say that someone who had stuck a carry on under their seat might want to use the bin space.\n\nAnyway, it was nice to see the rules enforced. ",

Nowhere else is this a custom where we try to block out all natural light in the middle of the day. I understand if the sun is shining directly through the window. Or maybe, like has happened with me, I\u2019m trying to get a baby to nap. Why do people not want sunlight in the middle of the day? Sun helps with our circadian rhythm and can elevate mood.\u00a0",
