We've previously been pretty lenient with what we allowed to be posted so long as it wasn't overt violations of those rules, but we've been getting a lot of feedback from users who are tired of the innuendo and the amount of reports and unsubs seems to support that. This is your sub and we'll moderate it how you want it moderated. To that end, the following rule changes are now in effect:\n\n* All comments consisting of any \\*ist/\\*phobic innuendo or generalizations = permaban. We previously just removed these comments if they weren't overt violations, but that approach didn't work.\n* All posts of minors = permaban. We repeat it over and over and there are a dozen school fights posted a day.\n* Any posts or comments that get removed by Reddit = permaban.\n* Obvious bait titles = permaban.",

Companies all train people to just cooperate, let robbers go, and make sure to get a good look at them for the cops. If amazon doesn't train you to to not fight back it's way riskier. If you got hurt or died defending amazon property you/your family could sue the shit out of amazon. And they'd win if they had reason to believe they'd lose their jobs.

So he would probably be wearing a mask. Like why would it not trigger from a new driver?  it knows if you use a Cell phone. I also figure since she doesn't know her route till that morning, she would have to have communicated where she would be going to be mid route and probably pick a better spot that isn't right where people leave the depot in broad daylight. Idk maybe they're that fuckin stupid but even a child could come up with a better plan. I feel like this was maybe a domestic where dude waited outside her work, managed to run in front of the vans till he found her and then all this started. Or he is a random hijacker who didn't know fuckall about the cameras and gps's and shit.\n\nEdit: according to the news he ran up, opened the door, she grabbed the keys and he yanked her out of the van, a lot of amazon workers keep their seat belt buckled and justout on the shoulder strap. and theb punched her in the face a few times.
