            "For some reason I am having issues using SteelSeries GG and Medal for capturing clips for my gameplay on my PC. They will detect the game, and then not detect it. GG just refuses to capture clips of any kind, even on desktop capture mode, and Medal, if it clips, has corrupted files. \n\nMy Apex Pro keyboard is also having issues with the backlighting and frequently glitches and will just go black instead of going to my game's lighting profile or even the default desktop profile. I've done a PC reset (I barely installed Windows so it was nbd) and it's not working.\n\nWindows Game Bar seems to work, and OBS will record, but only if desktop mode is active, I can't record using Game Capture on OBS.\n\nEverything was fine until I upgraded to Windows 11, and then I tried rolling it back and it's still having issues. Do I need to just do a clean wipe of my drive and start all over again? What is causing these issues?\n\nFor GG, I'll tab over to the game, I'll see it on my other monitor say it's recording, and then my keyboard flashes, goes dark, GG says no game detected, but then has a banner saying GG is recording.\n\nZero idea what's going on.\n\nEdit: And please don't suggest other recording software, I want to know what's going on because I've used both these programs for years with no issues and now my keyboard and clipping software refuse to work correctly since going to Windows 11 and reverting back to 10.",
            "Hi, so I'm trying to hit the new elden ring DLC, I played the previous game on an older 60hz monitor, since then I upgraded to a 144hz one, however the game looks weird and not smooth at all, on the other hand it looks really smooth on my 60 hz monitor, I've tried reducing the refresh rate and playing around with freesync/variable OD and other settings without success. Any Idea on how can I make my game as smooth as intended? I heard the disabling v-sync integrated in the game worked, it worked for me in kakarot that also has 60fps limit, but elden ring doesn't have this feature, appreciate any help. Thanks!",

So I rolled back my driver but the problem continued. I then tried to install many different game ready drivers but nothing changed. I then tried using a DDU and installing the latest driver but nothing changed. I then ran DDU again but this time I installed driver 537.58 as I heard it is the most stable Nvidia driver, however this did not resolve the issue. (I don't know if this is related to the issue, but everytime I use a launcher to run a game a new document is created titled \"launcher\" followed by a number.)\n\nAnyone know how to fix this? Thank you in advance",
            "Can you change the specific language of a physical copy of a game into English?",
            "Hi, here is the spec sheet for your laptop: [https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Legion/Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H/Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H\\_Spec.pdf](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Legion/Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H/Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H_Spec.pdf)\n\nYour laptop has two M.2 SSD slots, which support 2242 or 2280 module sizes. You can expand your storage by adding another SSD from any brand as long it's one of the two sizes. Your Laptop also supports up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM with 3200MHz or 2933MHz frequencies on two SO-DIMM slots.  I personally wouldn't recommend trying to mix and match RAM and instead buy 2x16GB or 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM. (The \"SO-DIMM\" is important here, because of the form factor). Something to keep in mind is a note in the document saying that \"installed memory is actually 3200MHz but may run at 2933MHz due to processor limitation\". \n\nHere is an image of your laptop without the back cover: [https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/\\_processed\\_/b/0/csm\\_Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H\\_Innereien2\\_72310f66ac.jpg](https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/_processed_/b/0/csm_Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H_Innereien2_72310f66ac.jpg)\n\nYou can see the RAM modules in the middle and the M.2 SSD slots on both sides.\n\nOpening a laptop can be a little tricky sometimes. Here is a video of somebody opening a Lenovo Legion 5: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD-1ThQn4Zc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD-1ThQn4Zc)",
            "The spec sheet says yes. Easy to check to be sure, just open it up.\n\nLaptop memory uses the SODIMM format, not full-size desktop. Ideally get the same speed and latency as what you have to avoid problems. You can check this using CPU-Z.\n\nSSD is a bit trickier because the laptop has one large slot (M.2 2280) and one small (M.2 2242). If you already have a large SSD you need to buy the small type.",
            "Yes.",
            "Cheapest is used, but there are too many combinations and prices to recommend. A ~10 year old PC with a GTX 960 is way more than enough for Morrowind and AoE2, or a laptop with a GTX 1050.\n\nFor building a new system yourself, Ryzen 5600G or GT fit in a ~$500 build, which is the lowest you can get using new parts and is cheaper than a laptop with comparable performance. Enough for what you want, not quite for AAA games from the last 5 years.",
            "You can go into bios and enable it. XMP is essentially a manufacturer overclock and is usually stable depending on you CPU\u2019s memory controller",
            "You can try forcing Vsync off through drivers. Nvidia control panel or AMD Adrenalin.\n\nIt's also possible to remove the 60fps lock but online components will be disabled.",
            "> I don't know if this is related to the issue, but everytime I use a launcher to run a game a new document is created titled \"launcher\" followed by a number.\n\nCan you elaborate on that? What launcher and what is the document, does it contain anything?\n\nDownload the free demo of 3DMark on Steam and run it. At the end you'll get a score and see a bunch of graphs. Take screenshots of everything, upload to imgur or somewhere else, and paste the links.",
            "Ok so do you think this ssd would work?\nCrucial P3 1TB PCIe Gen3 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD, up to 3500MB/s - CT1000P3SSD8 https://a.co/d/03ht7qNF\n\nAnd for ram it sounds like I can add another module but it has to be the same one I already have, or change both so they match?",
            "Oh ok, so ideally should I open it up to check what I have then? I've only opened it once to clean the fans but recently I've just been running low on storage that's why I want to make these upgrades",
            "Thanks, already tried that :/ no success, the only thinks that makes it close to my other monitor is maxing out variable OD, but the game looks so crispy, almost like it had no antialiasing, I will have to try out the 60fps unlock, thanks!",
            "Yeah. Even though the spec sheet says you've got empty slots, it could be outdated or simply wrong. It's also for \"Lenovo 5 15imh05h\" rather than your specific type, the specs could differ slightly."

            "When you create a game for everyone, you create a game for no one.  I think thats why a lot of AAA games became souless and generic games overtime because they try to cater to everyone and eventually appealed to less and less people. O=ne of the best parts of Elden Ring is the interactive difficulty slider which makes it very accessible while keeping the original spirit of the game intact. There are many ways to \"cheese\" the game via optional ingame mechanics. \n\nYou have the NPC summons via ashes that you can also upgrade and level. You have the actual NPC summons near fog gates like in previous games. You can summon other players to help you through the area and with the boss. You can explore a majority of the map without killing a single boss and grab upgrade materials to max your weapons out. You can over level the area and kill bosses at high levels.\n\nIf you want a harder experience you just limit yourself, don't use the summons. Stay region locked and don't overlevel and don't use the thousands of 1 shot buff builds and bleed/frost builds.",

            "Elden Ring shines because its difficulty is seamlessly integrated into the lore and the world itself. You can adjust the game's difficulty to your preference, and both easy and challenging experiences are equally rewarding.\n\nIf you want to make combat easier, you can find items, weapons, clothing, skills, and upgrade paths that help you achieve that (you can literally 1 shot bosses). This approach, which requires players to explore and use their brains rather than a simple difficulty slider, is what makes Elden Ring so successful.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the hardcore crowd that purposely limit their skills / levels to make their playthrough punishingly difficult. This game has it all, for all players.",

Even Renalla that I found very tough, if you use everything the game gives you is easily achieved in a dozen tries, I'm not Dan Gheesling I will not spend 1 month trying to beat a boss because I have to have no vig or some other reason, I believe you should play how you like but you have to consider that a game difficulty should not be adjusted to the challenge you set for yourself.",

Although, with the continuously additive design of these games the past 14 years you wonder where they\u2019ll end up if they keep going. At some point you lose the essence and it\u2019s just overdesigned nonsense.",
            "I just wish they invested more in quality of life that keeps good difficulty in the game (the terrible buffering of actions after 4 second stuns, frame locks, camera improvements for mouse). And honestly I hope future games have less getting stuck in animations, like you cant use an ability while turning sharply, it feels kind of random, but this is just one example.

They've also added several mobs with tens of thousands of hitpoints and multiple hit target locking combos that will stagger and kill you if you get hit. It's like many of the trash mobs are rune bear - levels of annoying. This, combined with graces that are often 40+ minutes apart, has me really tempted to respec into my troll infinite stamina fingerprint shield build that I once used, but even that wouldn't work because they also really enjoyed adding massive 360 AOE 90% hp attacks to most bosses this time around.

That would simply be an \"easy\" starter. A character class that starts with a significantly higher level than the rest, starts with better armor, has a better starter weapon, has a flask with more uses up front, and is loaded with essential items at the start. \nThis approach wouldn't dramatically change the experience, it would simply reduce the potential frustration from people who give up on these games after the first 3-5 hours, when they are at their weakest and die easily from very basic early game enemies.",

Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy \u2014 which, in my eyes, would break the game itself.\u201d\n\nCan't say I really agree with that statement. People playing in different difficulty settings can still get a similar sense of achievement after overcoming similar hurdles. Like, say there's a boss called Bossy McBossface. A person playing on Normal might struggle against him in that difficulty, while some other player might struggle playing on Hard. Both would get a sense of accomplishment after beating the boss. We have to remember that people have all different skills, and what might be hard for someone could feel easy for others.\n\nOr are we forgetting about \"Let me solo her\"?

There is almost a hardware solution for any disability, you can even 3D print gear to help people these days.

It's nowhere near as interesting as actually fighting them and learning the moveset. The latter parts of ER have bosses so oppressive that you end up with the worst of both worlds - fighting someone like Maliketh without summons is just fucking awful because you never get a chance to actually hit him due to him jumping around all the time, and playing with summons is just way too easy and you beat him first try.",

One of my friends figured out hyper armor and realized he was better off trading hits and healing off the dmg. Someone will look at this and say hes not playing the game right cuz ur suppose to dodge every hit and learn the patterns instead of trading. Another example is my gf who enjoy traversing the world but hated struggling with bosses and didn't \"get it\" until she realized she could summon others to tank for her while she blast the boss with magic. \n\nEveryone's experience throughout the game is going to be different but they will all feel the sense of accomplishment and thats what keeps players coming back.

            "I think there is another reason why Elden Ring's bosses are not as fun. Elden Ring has the most character customization of any FromSoftware game. It must of been extremely difficult trying to balance all the playstyles in the game. Which probably explains why the bosses all have AOEs, combos, range attacks, charges and wind up attacks.\n\nBloodborne doesn't have this problem because there is very limited playstyles. There is a handful of melee weapons, guns, and spells. The game encourages close combat to land parries and visceral attacks. As such, FromSoftware can design bosses specifically for the player on an intimate level. Creating those incredible moments that sticks out.\n\n(Side note: I spent an hour trying to come up a response why Elden Ring's bosses are so problematic. It finally clicked when I focused on the differences between ER and BB. So thank you for bringing that up and making me appreciate BB more)",
            "Wholeheartedly agreed. Soul of cinder's combo looks stupidly short compared to the most irrelevant mob in ER. I really want more duel style bosses, rather than big guy that explodes everywhere and hits you with AOE evem if you dodge it, new dancing lion is the primary example of this, not even talking about the camera.\n\nExploration is still the strong suit of elden ring but I think they dropped the ball on bosses just to make them look epic. It is great, but balancing around summons is really apparent and makes the learning curve a literal wall.\n\nAlso they cancel recovery frames by reading your animations, and keep doing 360 hits completely ignoring attack commitment souls games are known for.",

The DLC is not just for people who think that elden ring is getting too easy, but the vast majority of people who just want _more_ of the game.",

And God the dlcs have always had over the top difficulty.\n\n\nDs3 dlc (the ringed city specifically) was insanely harder than the base game. Bloodborne has always been the \"easiest\" (not implying it's easy persay) due to the rally mechanics and faster movement granting some leway in fights.\n\n In my opinion bloodborne, darksouls/elder ring/demon souls, and sekiro are all hard but in different ways. Bloodborne rewards the aggressive, ds/er rewards the defensive, and sekiro rewards endurance. Granted there are exceptions in every game but I just don't find it fair to compare them. Certain playstyles always preform better In thier game. \n\nElden rings dlc is pushing the boundary. In 3 weeks there will be strats that will trivialize it.

Plus without difficulty options it allows the devs to put all their focus on refining the experience/difficulty, rather than the often unbalanced feeling of most games with a \"hard\" mode. But as you said, it's good to have different games that offer either of those options, I wouldn't want all games to take this approach either.",

Steam charts peak playerbase is 900.000 and current is 500.000, that means that more people bought the game in the last two years and didn't play at release;  also means that many people bought the game and didn't even tried to play it; and lastly, it also means people played it when it came out but did not come back after that (even after the dlc released).\n\nNow, steam achievements says that 30% of the players finished the game, and if that is in fact true and we count that all the 12M players played the game (which we know it's not true, it's probably closer to 7-8M or less), 4M beat the game (30% of 12M).

It's not like other games where you have other systems and things you can enjoy, From Software games have little story aside from lore, the rpg systems are basic, if you skip the fighting or mod away the difficulty it's just a boring slog.\n\nThe furthest I ever got in a souls game was Elden Ring, and I did it by looking up all the weapons and different ways to to make things easy for myself. I tried blind when it first came out, hated it, quit. I made good progress and got to Altus plateau after beating the previous areas. And that's when I realised how bored I was. I wasn't having fun at all, it never clicked, nothing. So I just stopped playing.\n\nNow I enjoy Elden Ring by watching speed/challenge runs of it.

            "Elden Ring still has roughly the same base weapon classes that you have in DS3. Ashes of war or mixed physicks don't make any real difference.\n\nWhile in DS1 you can easily become overpowered by focusing on a magic build, they've since managed to keep those inbalances relatively in check unless you build deliberate glass cannon builds with very specific weapons (e.g bleed in DS3). In DS3 a magic build was easy at the start, then became pretty rough going until you get quite a bit further in the game. Even then at no point you start 2-3 shotting bosses or anything.\n\nThe real difference in ER is the ability for the player to summon NPC helpers at any time in a boss fight. In previous From games, the player was always solo unless they summoned another player or NPC player before the fight. To compensate for this, the game scaled the boss level by the number of players. By comparison, I think spirit ash summons in ER don't scale the boss level in the same way.\n\nSo From has started building those fights around the idea that players will summon help. Only problem is that they did absolutely nothing to overhaul the enemy AI to be able to handle this. It's still the same where a boss will focus on one enemy at a time while the rest can safely whittle down its health. \n\nInstead they decided to throw those long winded attacks to catch veteran players used to dodging anything, added a lot more long combos, AOE and grab attacks, and made the average boss health pool pretty large.

I do not, for instance, like Escape from Tarkov even though I'd like to. It's just too punishing for me in a way I personally feel is reductive, but that's just fine. That game does not need to be for me. I'll find another.\n\nAnother plus of having one single difficulty that I don't see talked about much is leveling player experiences equally. It's so interesting hearing about some ridiculous way someone else beat a boss because I know exactly how hard it was. That type of social aspect is diminished pretty significantly by difficulty options.\n\nI don't mean to talk your ear off, I've just never responded to threads like this despite reading them all the time.

Valheim we quit playing because you couldn't carry ores through portals and sailing was insanely tedious, although I hear that the option to do so has been added.

            "What a lot of open world games fail to understand is that you don't *put* content *in* the open world. The open world *is* the content. Give the player a set of well-crafted mechanics that are omnipresent throughout the world, some basic objectives to lead the player around it, and let them find their own fun. You should be able to remove every map marker, every mission, just reduce everything to the open-world systems, and the game should *still be fun*. It's why GTA continues to be so successful. I've known plenty of people who play GTA just to fuck around with the cops and go on rampages, and don't bother to interact with missions or other designer-made content at all.",

If they really wanted everyone to have the exact same difficulty then there would be one set of weapons, one set of armor, and no XP. Every encounter would be predetermined and balanced around one set of weapons and one pool of health. There's already ways in the game to scale the difficulty, so adding one more doesn't seem like it should be a big deal if it allows others to enjoy it.",
            "> The easy mode in this game is summon ashes or the coop system. \n\nAs much as I like Elden Ring and am more in the \"no sliders is part of the design\", I would have to disagree with your characterization here.  \n\nThere isn't an \"easy mode\" in Eldenring. Some playstyles may be stronger and more optimal than others but that is not what a difficulty adjustment is. Games with and without difficulty sliders will have more optimal and meta playstyles, but the difference is how much a player is forced to play optimally. \n\n\nNot having a difficulty slider does fit Fromsofts vision more, but that does come with real downsides in accessibility.",

            "As the other commenter said, It's prequel Hollow Knight was an indie darling. The kind of game that only comes around once per console generation. So a sequel would have more than a ton of hype around it. \n\nMore than that though, I think the bigger reason that fans have been so rabbid about it is the fact that it really feels like it should have come out by now. \n\nSilksong was announced in Febuary of 2019, or over 5 years ago. That in and of itself isn't remarkable. Games certainly can and have taken longer to develop. Even indie games. But what is remarkable is the fact that in June of that same year, it had a playable demo at E3 courtisy of Nintendo's showroom floor. Now, I don't know about you, but if a game has a playable demo available at what was the biggest gaming event of the time? I would feel fairly confident that it was getting pretty close to completion. Within a couple years atleast. \n\nAnd then, 3 years later, we got a new trailer for Silksong through Xbox's June 2022 showcase. And it should be stressed that Microsoft actively advertised that anything you saw in the showcase would be released within 12 months of it. So we DID have a general release window from that trailer. But, as you've gathered, it hasn't released. The game was delayed and; if memory serves; Team Cherry didn't announce this fact until  the very end of the 12 month window; if not after it had already passed. \n\nBut to top it all off, The Developers; Team Cherry; have been *remarkably* silent about the whole ordeal. When you see people complain about \"radio silence\"? That's not an exaggeration. I think we've gotten maybe... four big news drops sense it's reveal? The E3 Demo, the Xbox trailer, an article in Edge Magazine from early 2021, and a Blog Post about a year after the reveal trailer. That's at best a single news drop per year at the current rate.

            "Yes, and the only reason Hollow Knight even released when it did was because the dev team was running out of money. No chance of that this time around, they are all multi-millionaires. They can work on it as long as they like.",
            "I mean, the first game took them 3-4 years to make, and based on what the developers have said, Silksong is about 2-3 times bigger. From the outside looking in, the development time for Silksong seems to track.\n\nI'm not saying it's ideal. Seven years is a long time for any game. But I just think people have unrealistic expectations for a 3-man dev team. We don't know what kind of work schedule they operate on or what kind of things they deal with outside of work that might eat in to development time. Bigger studios that rely on crunch can deal with that more easily, but someone on a 3-man team being out of work for whatever reason is probably going to impact the speed of development more noticeably.\n\nIf these guys are trying to stick to 40 hour work weeks and are taking vacations and sick days at a reasonable rate then it makes sense to me why it would take them such a long time to finish this game, if it's as big as they say it is.",
            "I get it. I'm not a huge fan, but I recognize that it's an excellent game, so I can understand the hype for the sequel. I just think people might have unrealistic expectations of a 3-man team. 6+ years is a long time, but from what they have said it seems like this game is 2-3 times the size of the original, so the length of development kind of tracks. I think the first game took like 3-4 years for them to make.\n\nThe biggest consideration is how much the speed of development will be affected when one of them gets sick, takes a vacation, or has some other event in their life that has to take precedent over work. Larger studios can deal with this much easier, but with only three people it's a totally different story. They may also just be practicing a much healthier work-life balance, especially if they are flush on cash from sales of the first game. I'd be doing the same thing lol.\n\nI can 100% agree that some more transparency on the game's progress would be good. I think a lot of people just want affirmation that the game is in fact *not* in development hell.",
            ">What it was supposed to be, and what people paid for, was DLC for the first game. \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but the Hornet DLC was a funding milestone (the $56K milestone) that was reached during the course of the campaign. Nobody paid for the Hornet DLC specifically. If you pledged $10 (the lowest pledge option available) or more, you received a digital copy of Hollow Knight and the Hornet DLC would be a free add-on once it was released. I suppose if people are upset and complaining that they didn't get their full $10 worth out of Hollow Knight because it never got the Hornet DLC then that's one thing. But I just don't see how the base game alone is not a high enough value that it honors the minimum $10 pledge.\n\nRegardless, I can agree that there's still a void here that needs filling. The right thing for Team Cherry to do would be to provide backers with a fair discount on Silksong if/when it releases, or perhaps give them free copies entirely. I'm pretty sure they are self-publishing the game, so it should be within their power to make that happen. \n\nAnyway, this situation is a prime example of how game crowdfunding can be so messy. Milestones are an easy pitfall for developers to fall in to, and lots of people have the wrong expectations when it comes to pledging money to a campaign. It's not the same as pre-ordering an upcoming game or buying an unfinished game that's in early access. With crowdfunding, you are simply funding a developer so they can take their *concept* for a game and try to make it a reality. The problem is, concepts and ideas are in a constant state of flux during a game's development cycle, and this can lead to things like a game growing in scope or initial ideas and features being cut for technical or logistical reasons. That's why making promises for free DLC through milestones is a risky endeavor. People will naturally view that milestone as an immutable part of the base product's value, and if a developer changes course with that milestone or they end up unable to fulfill it then you get situations like this.",

            "> There are games made by single devs that managed to get released before Silksong. \n\nOk, but there are numerous factors at play which makes this kind of a moot point.\n\n* The most obvious: size and complexity of the game.\n\n* Studio size and developer skill/experience level:\n  * How big of a difference does having 3 people vs. 1 actually make?\n  * Developers with more skill and experience might get more done on a day to day basis compared to those with less skill and experience.\n\n* Work-life balance: \n  * What kind of schedule do they operate on? \n  * Do they deal with any chronic illnesses or conditions that require time off?\n  * Do they need time off in order to care for family/loved ones?\n  * Do they have to work a second job for additional financial support?\n  * Do they take annual/seasonal vacations?\n\n> At this point if the scope is too large for 3 folks to handle for 7 years, maybe it\u2019s a sign to dial things back.\n\nPerhaps. But we aren't in a position to decide whether or not Silksong is too large in scope for Team Cherry to handle. That's up for them to decide for themselves. Hopefully the game does come out and it's as good as or better than the first game and it will have been worth all the blood sweat and tears that they poured in to it. We can only decide for ourselves whether or not we care enough to keep waiting.\n\nMore importantly, they are not the first indie studio to bite off more than they can chew, and they will not be the last. Iconoclasts was a 1-man endeavor that took 8 years to make. Great game. Should that guy have dialed things back? I dunno, it might not have turned out as good. Crosscode was made by a dozen people and took a decade to make. *Incredible* game. Should they have dialed things back? Hard to say. But it was their first game ever and they completely knocked it out of the park, so perhaps 10 years was the amount of time they needed to make the game so good. The point being, this is kind of common with big indie projects. They take a long ass time to make, for better or worse.\n\nAnyway, I totally get why people are growing more concerned after all this time since the first game became such a wild success and people want to see more. But at the end of the day Hollow Knight was an ambitious project by a very small team, and that hasn't changed despite their success. Team Cherry didn't go the route of other indie studios and hire a bunch of people and expand. They chose to remain small and, apparently, have grown *more* ambitious. We can only wait and see if they succeed again.",

They've done it once already with the base Hollow Knight They know what they're capable of, and if they want to scale it back, all the better, because then they wouldn't have made \"false promises\"  to their fans by having to scale back development if they had talked too much and then had to go back on it. \n\nRemember that HK offers over 40 hours of content, in the base game alone, and they are building on that. Every flower is hand painted. Every frame hand animated.\n\nAs someone in software, bloat often comes from executives demanding changes that werent in the plan, and then that new plan doesnt get communicated or properly elaborated on and then a half assed solution gets built, due to conflicting requirements needing to be stapled on top of what was supposed to be cut and dry.\n\nScope Creep is definitely avoidable, especially if there's a competent leadership and developer behind it. And seeing as the team has already delivered a MASSIVE game with minimal bugs (Well, except all the... yknow, bugs) I have no doubt they went into it with a plan.\n\nIf they've expanded that plan, it will be between very close knit people, not a team of 30-40 people that all have different ideas of what that plan should be. Not some weird \"IT NEEDS A CRAFTING SYSTEM LIKE MINECRAFT\" from an exec that has no idea what state the project is in or where the project was supposed to go.\n\nAgain, they probably did have internal delays, 2020-2022 was a rough time for any team, but they also have no reason to rush. They are rich for life.\n\nIt's the same for Haunted Chocolatier. Work naturally doesn't happen as fast when people are already successful and their isn't a NEED for income.",
            "Nah I doubt this. The devs have every single reason to want to communicate with the community if their development is going better than what the community thinks. There are no upsides and only downsides to not communicating if they're doing well, and no downsides and only upsides to communicate.  \n\nSo clearly something is not going well, because no sane dev would allow false rumors about them to be popular when they could easily debunk them",

They both similarly had a lot of stretch goals but SK gave us an expansion campaign every 1-2 years instead of waiting 7 years.
