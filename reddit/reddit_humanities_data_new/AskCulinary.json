Outside of that go wild with it - brand recommendations, recipe requests, brainstorming dinner ideas - it's all allowed.",

            "This is more like a cleanliness question. Besides a splatter screen, what other tools/techniques can i use to minimize oil splatters. I like to sear bacon, fish, meats etc.",
            "this is an odd question, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any good answers. One of the things I enjoy most in life is food, cooking, baking. Lately because of some depression, and continuing loss of vision I seem to be losing my passion to cook. I still immerse myself in the science of it, reading, yada yada yada. But I just can\u2019t seem to muster up the passion that I used to have. Everything is so much more difficult to do, so much more frustrating, and not having the visual feedback, well, you can imagine what that\u2019s like. just like to know if anyone has any ideas and how I can get my passion back, it\u2019s truly one of the only things I have leftu",
            "I dont want to make an entire post for a single question that I havent had a proper answer to on the web.\n\nI made some food for dinner, I used some gochujang in the sauce for pulled beef. When I tasted it all I got was a really salty taste I put towards the oyster sauce and soy sauce I used. I didnt taste any spice. \n\nQue my fiance who instantly starts sweating and huffing about the spiciness of it. Note: his tolerance is 0. The spiciest thing he can eat is doritos SCH.\n\nSo, how come my food tastes spicy to him (visibly red lips and sweat) whereas all I could taste was salt?",
            "ok so back when i was a kid 90s to 2000s there was supposed to be this super sour candy and all the commercials said it was a whole new thing becase it was made from super sour anti sugar \n\ni figured it was just a gimmick but trying to look up anti sugar candy just gets me sugar free candy and how you can lose weight when you stop eating sugar  \n  \nim guessing it was **Sour sanding** or **Citric acid**   \n  \nany ideas ... im fairly sure i didn't make it up",
            "What is the best way to cook Kasekrainer without all of the cheese leaking out? I grilled on a rack on medium high and most of it seemed to come out. Fortunately I laid foil underneath so I was able to scoop it up and plate it, but I'd like to keep as much in the sausage until eating if I can!\n\nEdit: The sausages I have are actually already cooked, so it's just a case of reheating them.",

            "I'm going on a fishing trip in Canada soon, catching mostly walleye and lake trout. This is our second time doing it, and we're looking for ways to do more than fried fish every night. Any ideas? Already considering fish tacos, ceviche, and Thai fish cakes, and that might be good enough, but I'd love to get some other thoughts. Can't find much inspiration from google under all the fish fry recipes. Thanks!",
            "made beef stragnoff using [recipe ](https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/beef-stroganoff-4/3574df69-6fc1-4473-a0a6-582ff24c8779)and i thought to simmer it a little longer than the recipe using rump steak, however it tasted more chewy and less flavourful compared to the first 5 minutes of simmering. i simmer it for around 30 minutes as i thought it would develop better if i cooked it like stew. \n\ni do realise this could be partly due to the rump steak and made it tasted more gamey? \n\nis there a reason it tasted worse when simmering longer? \n\nwhy does simmering work for stews but not particularly for beef stragnoff? would it have worked if it was a different cut of beef?",
            "Hi i lost power the other night from around 9 pm to 3am and was wondering if the eggs I got from the supermarket should be thrown out. I live in USA",

            "Odd perhaps but certainly not unheard of. Hell, I do this for a living which fundamentally changes how one feels about the experience of creating something as visceral as sustenance. When one experience dims, another can creep up to take its place and in those crossed wires may be some truly unique feelings. \n\nFor me, the act of making food is a full body experience- often because I am running from one potential disaster to another lol. For example tho, I stop adding eggs to p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux when I hear the batter *slapping* the side of the bowl, my hands tell me when dough needs a rest from kneading and I can use the jab of a finger to tell the temp of a steak [that one took a LONG time to develop.] You might want to try to make things outside of your normal comfort zone- perhaps more frustrating but if you can let go a bit, something new can spark a new passion. Using hands and nose differently.\n\nBread is incredibly tactile. I've worked with some bread geniuses [all of them mad scientists]-  they anthropomorphise their doughs [A Boy Named Sue is my favourite starter name] and can tell where they are in the process by touch. Playing with different types of starters can be very engaging- just ask all the people who took it up during the pandemic.  A beautiful blend of the scientific yet tasty.  I am well versed in pastry but if I am bored, my crew will throw a recipe for pain au chocolat at me and watch me twist in the wind but even the mistakes are delicious. Let yourself enjoy the f-ups. And watch Amaury Guichon on YT to induce envy. Maybe try to do his chocolat work. In order to feel inadequate of course lol.\n\nAnother great tactile challenge is pasta making. And damn it pays off. My favourite is Evan Funke. American Sfoglino. And the Pasta Grannies on YT are the best. I kick myself in the butt when I see some 102 year old gran making some rare pasta they only make in her remote Tuscan village. Who needs fancy molds when you have ancient gnarled hands lol.\n\nThen there's smell. I have to produce a unique amuse bouche everyday so we keep a huge library of elements that we mix and match, use to garnish, etc. to keep them interesting. We do a lot of pickling, fermenting and dehydrating. Smell and taste are intrinsically linked [hello there Nose Dive by my hero Harold McGee] so I find it fascinating to discover how products develop over time. Ties food back to our ancient forebears- make jerky, learn about fermented sausage, watermelon rind pickles [my Texas is showing]. Follow how flavours develop over time, temp, environment. \n\nHope that gives you a little something to ponder. Hang in there ; )",
            "Sushi rice is probably best. Nishiki short-grain should be something in the Calrose family, most likely.",
            "Eggs can be left out, for a surprisingly long time, yet suffer no ill effects.\u00a0 Crack in a bowl, and give it a long, slow whiff. Your nose...-knows.",
            "I like this answer, better cooking technique. And going to try other techniques like sous vide",
            "good call, i was thinking of how to reuse the oil. i could just collect it in the baking tray and pour it out!",
            "thank you so much! An inspirational talk from my culinary coach! Lol don\u2019t know if I\u2019m at the point where I can trust my SHU pastry to my hearing, but I\u2019ll have to work on that now! i\u2019ve tried to look at my particular challenge. It\u2019s just another hurdle to overcome is one would technique.\nthanks again I very much enjoyed your post",
            "Also true! I don't even souz vide but if you somehow have splatter with that, I'm afraid you're doing it terribly wrong :P",
            "Exactly what I do \u2013 and if I'm making eggs at the same time, then some of the rendered bacon fat finds its way into the pan with the eggs."

It'll be 5 days of shooting, and as far as I can tell from the schedule, I'll only have to provide one meal (just lunch, though I do think it would be nice to have snacks/finger food available for the entire day). It'll be around 30 people every day and from what I can tell, the budget for catering is about $480, meaning a bit less than $100 a day. I really want to do a good job and provide good, nutritious meals, but is $100/d not too little? It'll be my first time catering and I'm a little worried about the limit of options",

            "I would say no, unless you're able/willing to cook. You can do snacks for $3 per person per day, but full nutritious lunch will be hard. Maybe if you did Costco wraps or something like that. \n\nIf you are willing to cook, and you've never cooked for 30 people a day for 5 days, I would not recommend that route.",
            "Would you be doing this as some kind of favour, or is this part of a business you're running?\n\nYou're working on a budget of about $3 per person per day. I don't really see how to make any profit while providing anything better than PBJs, goldfish crackers and tap water. And even then it's questionable, once you account for the time spent shopping, preparing and setting up on location. \n\nI can understand that a student film production has limited budget. But they'd probably spend more money on a homemade sandwich than they are offering you for the catering.",
            "Eh, how about pasta? Pasta e fagioli goes a long way. Bulk tortillas instead of bread. Other days can be stuff that stretches...stews with rice, soup, etc. chicken thighs can be had for cheap, marinate in some yogurt aioli and grilled or baked. Not much room for profit in any case though.",

            "Not a business at all, I was originally supposed to just manage the location as an unpaid gig, but they are now considering having me provide for the crew. I love cooking, so I thought this would definitely be doable, but now that I've done some research on catering it's all quite daunting, given the low budget. Thank you for the insight, I'll have to bring it up in the next meeting then.",

E330 is food-grade citric acid, and the naturally-occurring chemical responsible for the sour element of most citrus fruits. It also lists \"natural citrus flavour\" as an ingredient, but I'm betting citric acid is doing most of the heavy lifting here.\n\nYou can buy bags of citric acid to cook with online or from certain specialty stores if you're lucky. Just don't use too much. It's very powerful stuff.",

You can def buy this from anyone that carries Boiron pur\u00e9es.\u00a0\n\nTo me it\u2019s like a lime and a tangerine mixed together but with the intensity of yuzu.
