It is not that easy to govern a country but also to find international solutions to problems\u00a0\u2026\"\n\nHard to disagree with any of that.",

            "As I sit at work early on a Saturday morning, tired, alone, and literally just watching ice melt for a few hours, I ended up thinking back to the calling of the election. There was that first mini-gaffe where Sunak strongly promised a woman he would pass a new law before the end of Parliament in the morning, then dissolved Parliament that afternoon. \n\nThere was a lot of discussion at the time on if he had meant what he said, but then in those couple of hours suddenly decided to call the election with no warning. Or of he was always planning to call it that day and was lying to her about passing new laws.\n\nThe betting scandal makes it pretty obvious that Sunak knew ahead of time he was calling the election, so was clearly lying to her. It's not a big surprise as everyone by now knows how little regard he holds for other people, but it's incredible just how readily and easily he finds deceiving random people for even super short term gains.\n\nIronically it still leaves the possibilities that either he still only decided literally the day before, or he trusts his own team so little that he had to wait until the last possible moment to tell them, and then they were still so incompetent they managed to cause him yet another scandal.",

Farage deserves the exact same treatment.\n\nedit: I wouldn't care if I agreed with a candidate on every single issue except this one. This one is a make or break.

            "The main question to me isn't will Farage's comments on Russia cost him votes, because it seems to me very plain that they won't. What I think is probably more interesting and what time will tell is whether any on the Tory right after the election wipeout will jon him. \n\nAfter all, with the traditional donor streams locked down by Labour, money's going to be tight. Some have already been flirting very strongly with the Orb\u00e1nist right in Europe and far right in the US through networks like the New Conservative movement, both of which are either soft on Russia or openly courting Putin as an ally. I could very easily see the Tories going the same way as the Republicans in the US in finding their commitment to NATO significantly less firm than it is right now.",
            "Farage had a unique chance to rebrand Reform as the new Tory party with a focus on immigration and more in touch with the working class.\n\nAfter praising Putin and being anti-NATO he's just proven his party is just another loony party that's a threat to national security.\n\nHe may not lose many extreme voters but he's put an absolute ceiling on how many votes the party can get for the next few elections.",

It\u2019s long been the case and it\u2019s a common feature of the populist right on both sides of the Atlantic (think Trump, think Orb\u00e1n). They have a curious soft spot for the Kremlin and a hostility to NATO, which means on this issue they have more in common with Jeremy Corbyn, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and others on the anti-West far left.*",
            "gotta hand it to Farage. Never in my life did I think there would be a situation I'd consider voting Conservative.\n\nYet, if my choice was Reform or Conservative because no other party has a chance to win? I'd be voting Conservative. Thank god I live in a strong Labour seat tho.",
            "I've felt like I needed a break from the election, but it just keeps sucking me back in. \n\nBut then I see the BBC top story is JK Rowling criticising Labour on women's rights and that has definitely given me the motivation to ignore politics for the day!",

Another reason is the risk averse nature of investment capital in the UK. The set up costs to create a decent mortgage business would be dramatically higher than that of current accounts. That would require large amounts of capital for return reasonably far in the future. It\u2019s areas like this that the country should prioritise investment. An incredibly profitable industry is dominated by clunky old dino companies that cannot be fixed. There needs to be incentives for companies to try. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll get real growth.

            "Of course. The whole point of the Reform UK project, just like the Tories, is to rebuild Britain to become a tax haven for the wealthy and a sweatshop/forced labour colony for the rest of us. This is what Brexit was all about. \n\nYou don't need workers rights or proper wages, you don't need free healthcare, affordable housing or a benefits system, you don't need human rights... all this is 'woke' nonsense. \n\nIf you think Farage is 'telling it like it is' and all this stuff they're taking from you is going to be replaced, I suggest you go have a lie down and stay well away from plastic carrier bags and sharp objects.",
            "\"People who pay more tax benefit from tax cut shocker\". \n\nI'm not shill for Reform by any stretch, but these headlines (which can apply to any income tax cut by any party) very much fall into \"bear shits in woods\" category. \n\nThat said, the 40% threshold is too low. What was originally sold as a tax that only affects the highest earners is now starting to catch a lot of fairly ordinary people on fairly ordinary career trajectories.",
            "Well, all the fiscal drag and tax polices for the past 20 years benefited the low earners. 10% of population pays 60% of income tax. And let's not forget that we have one of the highest marginal tax rates in the world. \nA high earner in UK pays scandinavian level of tax without the benefits that comes with it ( like no free tuition, no free childcare, even worse, you no longer allowed to use childcare funded through your own tax money , and so on ). Being a high earner in UK is a bad return on investment compared to most of the countries IMHO.\n\nAnd before you throw shit at me. The high earners are not the problem. They're the solution. Higher earner \u2260 rich. Those are still people that work for a living. Doctors, engineers, IT professionals and so on. Currently what is happening is that we got a 8 milion NHS backlog and doctors are reducing hours not to hit 70% marginal tax rates. IT professionals and remote workers moving abroad for a better standard of living and lower taxes. That's what crab mentality gets you, a worse off society without growth.",

The willful blindness of the population on this conundrum means that we get mainstream political parties who don't want to level straight with us about the trade-offs, and allowing Reform to inflame the narrative that we can have a tax-cutting bonanza without negative consequences will make the job of building trust between the mainstream parties and the general public even more difficult in future, thus further eroding trust in politics.",

            "People still go on about Thatcher because she was frank about what she stood for, what her objectives were and how she was to go about achieving them (qualities I feel Corbyn shares).\n\nFor many people she made education easier to access through Student Loans for accomodation, she made the poorest home-owners by selling them their state housing at high discounts needing only small deposits, she helped us through and out of the energy/oil crisises curbing inflation by crushing the unions that keps insisting on raising wages (causing more inflation) and which had policies of overstaffing reducing our productivity, she made reforms so that unions could no longer coerce their members into joining and so that no strike would be held without a proper vote & process when before the country was often brought to its knees in strikes that the union members weren't even fully behind.\n\nAnd at what cost? The decimation of some communities of their traditional jobs, the humiliation of signing up for the doll, the landscape of a proud industrious nation being pulled back into the reality, the reality that we had lost the advantage of being the first to industrialise and other nations of greater populations and resources were able to do many things better than us, an inevitable consequence where we wonder what it means to be a 'service society'.\n\nAnd indeed had she reformed the planning system and built houses at the same rate she was selling them into the private hands of the poor, we wouldn't be facing many of the problems that we face today.\n\nWhere we do agree is that to sell some assets makes sense, others do not, and I do think privatising utilities & infrastructure that is natively not competitive was an idiotic move by her and her successors.\n\nNow where do reform stand? To bring back industrialisation where it's feasible to do so. To reform the planning system. To reduce immigration until we're back on our feet. To bring back utilities into 50% public ownership.\n\nI'd rather them or Corbyn to lead our country than the Store-Brand Tories & Labour that claim to represent the values of their parties and the fence-sitting Liberals.\n\nSo yes. People do have a great deal of good to say about Thatcher because she had guts and she defeated communism and that same devotion to her duty turned out to be a double-edged sword only because so many subsequent Prime Ministers did nothing to respond to the rising challenges for decades. She would not have coasted like every single one of her successors did, until Blair came to power and did many things that unfortunately exaccerbated previous problems.",

The original notion is that as we get older, we accumulate wealth, we have a house, a family, and a pension pot. Middle-aged people with these things value stability over revolution, so gravitate to conservative attitudes, which are about maintaining the status quo.\n\nBy taking an anti young people stance like the tories have done and delayed this wealth accumulation, you end up with a middle-aged group with no reason to want to maintain their status quo.

            "Sunak and Starmer are right. Farage is saying that Poland, the Baltic states and other countries with a pretty recent history of being invaded by Moscow shouldn\u2019t have chosen to protect themselves by joining NATO. Finland and Sweden did not feel a need to join NATO until Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. \n\nAnd Putin\u2019s views on Ukrainian autonomy and independence pre-date the expansion of NATO: there is a clip of him from the early 1990s in which he complains about how Lenin gave autonomy to Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire. He has repeated these views ever since: he wrote an article in 2021 entitled \u201cOn the Historical Unity of the Russian and Ukrainian People\u201d and his invasion speech of February 2022 was a long lecture about why the collapse of the Russian Empire and the USSR were bad things.",

I can imagine putins glee at getting his men into high office in the two countries which have traditionally been seen as the leaders of the western world.",

The interests of the UK don\u2019t really change, the brief stays the same.\u00a0\n\nEnsuring the war continues in Ukraine is in the interests of the UK. It drains Russian resources, valuable info can be gathered to adapt doctrine, we can test the effectiveness of our equipment,\u00a0and importantly the US/UK can show they will defend the rules based order they impose on the rest of the world. We can also get revenge for Salisbury.\n\nEverything else is just propaganda and noise. Russia isn\u2019t seeking to rebuild its empire, it isn\u2019t seeking WW3. It can\u2019t because of NATO. Ukraine is very important for Russian national security. Ukraine left the Russian sphere of influence, and now Russia wants it back. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nA war in Ukraine has been predicted for decades anyway, well before the revolution.

Indulging in racist / nationalistic rhetoric and associating with far right activists,  conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, climate sceptics, Nazi sympathizers, etc. is bad enough - but openly parroting the lies of an authoritarian dictator engaging in a brutal, unprovoked war of aggression based on paranoia and revanchist delusions, as part of a broader effort to rebuild the Russian Empire and weaken / outright destroy the 'West', *has* to be recognised & responded to as the Rubicon-crossing moment it is. \n\nHe is no longer a 21st Century Enoch Powell; he is a 21st Century Oswald Mosley.

What he's saying is just a dog whistle to pro-Russian scum that he's on their side but worded so he can deny it and say he meant something else if challenged on it.\n\nPeople who support Russia and want us to cut off Ukraine and force them to surrender don't say that openly, they veil it with crap about NATO expansion and \"let's talk about peace deals instead\". The pro Russian ones know *exactly* what he means.",
            "Tbh, I think most people aren't pro Putin. Or anti climate change. Even amongst their supporters. There's a small group of red pill 4chan young people who are. Most people like them because of the immigration stuff. I bet most other people don't know/don't support the Putin or anti climate change stuff. That's the thing with been a single issue party when your other stuff doesn't go down half aswell.",

They're both trans women.\n\nAsfaik \"red pill\" spawned from gamergate, popularised by 4chan, and then morphed (alongside gamergate) into a general catch all term the far-right use as a bastardised version of \"woke\" (the original meaning of it anyway).\n\nAs for why, well 4chan being 4chan viewed the Matrix as a metaphor for people \"waking up\" from being controlled by either women (for your misogynist users of the term) or some nebulous \"NWO\", often Jewish (for your generic far-right users of the term).\n\nEdit: Looks like the Reform candidate is using the term as the latter, generic far-right antisemitic meaning.",
            "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-53692435\n\nI mean, it's close enough.\n\nThe intention is there to make it a trans metaphor overtly but it didn't make it production. It's still quite queer coded.",

            "I'm really not sure, very torn sometimes. If the left wants to head off the rise of something awful  the concerns of working class social conservatives will have to be adressed.  That doesnt mean throwing x or y group under the bus, just raising most peoples living standards enough  that scapegoats arent required.",

            "It probably gained more traction after Gamergate but The Red Pill was created over 2 years before Gamergate happened.

            "Someone else already posted the first link as a reply - I hadn't seen that before and I replied to them.\n\nYour other two paragraphs, I'm afraid, completely lost me.\n\nBut if \"red pill\" is another word for \"woke\" (which itself seems to be the new \"politically correctness gone mad\") to one group while also being a symbol of trans identity for another, with origins shrouded in overtones of misogyny and antisemitism, then it sounds a little like its the absolute perfect internet argument topic! All you need is to throw COVID in there somehow it'd be complete.\n\nWhich is a good point for me to step back. I'll let our colleagues in the YouTube comments section take it from here.",
            "Huh. Interesting! Thanks for sharing that.\n\nThe article notwithstanding, I think I'd still maintain that in the released film it's a pretty subtle metaphor that could apply equally well to any other \"becoming aware of the truth\" paradigm, even if the author's inspiration came from one particular set of experiences.\n\nIn other words, there's plenty to criticise Reform candidates for this election, but I'll give them a pass on not picking up on this one! If they want to use the \"red pill\" and \"blue pill\" as symbolic of something to do with voting for them or not, that's fine by me.",
            "Honestly I thought it was a cheesy movie with a lot of action scenes innovatively using slo-mo inspired from Descartes 'evil demon' concept.\n\nI definitely need to re-watch it and pay more attention xD I was probably too young to pick up on all the 'queer-coding' mentioned in other comments.",

That\u2019s how deep the right wing propaganda has run in this country.",
            "\"Woke\" was originally a progressive term, used by the African American community, as shorthand for \"aware of racial prejudice and discrimination\". It was only later that it was bastardised as a term of mockery by the right wing, as you said turning into meaning \"it's PC gone maddd\".\n\nBut nobody uses \"red pill\" outside the far-right, even if it was originally a trans analogy. It has been totally coopted and anybody unironically using it will be an unpleasant person.",
            "Not quite. If you have taken the red pill you have woken up, which is not the same as being \u201cwoke\u201d. Look up Based and Red Pilled.",
            "Yeah, AFAIK \"red pill\" is more used as \"you've been woken up to the conspiracy\" (which they take to include all forms of \"political correctness\") rather than the older use of \"woke\" which is woken up to the oppression of the powerful and originated in black communities.\n\nRed pill guys would view \"woke\" as part of the conspiracy against them, along with feminism (which is why \"red pill\" and \"pick up artist\" go hand in hand).",

I wouldn't be surprised if it were something like 25% real people, like those articles the other day of people trying to see if the reform replies on tiktok were real.\n\nBut a lot of the troll factory work used to be done by hand using the kind of tools that businesses use for managing social media accounts, before LLMs and the like. If it's people in an office in a low income country getting paid to do it, rather than fully automated bots like Twitter's pussy-in-bio swarm, it doesn't really make it better.",
            "Ironically a lot of the policies on the left would help the working class. Harsher taxes on the wealthy would mean better funded public services, investment in green infrastructure would mean long term sustainable economy and jobs, stronger worker rights would mean, even if you are native or immigrant, you would have the right to strike and negotiate for better wages.\n\nAnd yet, right wing media has poisoned the well to the point where if you even mention these things you are branded as loony lefty liberal.",
            "That would have been an interesting story element for sure - and played nicely into the idea of computer gamers generating a character who is entirely unlike them. I could imagine it confusing things for the audience though, especially back when the film was released.",

            "Yeah, indeed.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion on it in general. It depends on the work for me.\n\nIt seems at least rude and at worst unhelpful to completely ignore any comment from the author on their work. If they tell you they were inspired by X, or thinking of Y, or definitely not writing about Z then that deserves some attention.\n\nSimilarly, it can't be true that \"I interpret work A as being a metaphor for B\" is reasonable for all possible values for A and B. Sometimes it's just going to be nonsense.\n\nOn the other hand, it feels unnecessarily exhausting to have to keep up with whatever an author (perhaps even a corporate author like a studio) happens to want to add or correct or reveal about their work. Or the author who insists that some scene that can perfectly well be understood as C is actually about D, when the text doesn't make the case particularly strongly.\n\nAnd there's something quite tedious about the sort of super-fan who insists you can't possibly understand Luke Skywalker's arc in the original Star Wars (which is about as simple as an arc can get) without textbooks worth of context, as though it were a religion.\n\nSo yeah. I'm somewhere in the middle? Mild cold of the author? Sprained ankle of the author?",

            "One of the most confusing aspects, to my mind, was why one\u2019s Matrix presence necessary bore *any* resemblance to one\u2019s physical form in the first place, given nobody observed the physical form.",
            "i suppose the reason would be the same one that the matrix needs to be a copy of the real world right? to put humans in a cage they cant see. Given they have their bodies perhaps an avatar that diverges from their body would give them a kind of dysphoria and threaten to break the illusion?\n\nI dont know why the robots cant just ket them up to eyeballs in their little battery?"
