Almost every chatter that comes to my stream is asking what ideas I have for my channel/offering their ideas to \"help\" my channel grow.

Does anyone know what these chatters are actually trying to offer? How do I prevent this from happening in the future? I don't have any bots set up to moderate chat as of now, and I don't necessarily want to remove them as they give my channel follows and engagement, which I have none of at the moment.

All these so called \"artists\" who solicit through chat are guaranteed to be using the same free emblem generator site.\n\nIf you really feel like your overlay needs something, either design one if you are capable to do so, or look on streamelements. They have a whole gallery of free to use overlays that often come complete with several scenes (starting soon, gameplay, just chatting, break and ending).\n\nThese can also be personalized.",

I just don\u2019t entertain them once I see that self advertising message. they can fuck right off, and if they don\u2019t leave themselves and are persistent it\u2019s a ban.
