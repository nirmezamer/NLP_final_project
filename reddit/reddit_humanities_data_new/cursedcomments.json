The mod team is working hard to remove as much spam as possible but we cannot spot them all.\n\n**Why are spam bots bad?**\n\nOther than being unwanted because they repost rule-breaking content, spam bots are bad because they are usually scam accounts or accounts that get sold to scammers.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below or send us a [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcursedcomments).\n\n*-The cursed team*",
