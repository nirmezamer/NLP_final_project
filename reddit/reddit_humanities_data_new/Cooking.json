            "I'm marinading whole chicken leg pieces to have with rice later. My question is, is it safe to cook the rice with the left over marinade in a rice cooker?\n\nI'm basically wondering if a rice cooker gets hot enough to kill all the bacteria in the marinade from the raw chicken.\n\nThanks in advance.",
            "What is the best way to store and open package of bacon?",
            "I didn\u2019t know I needed to soak my asparagus, I just rinsed it like a regular vegetable and roasted it in olive oil. It\u2019s gritty so I think it still had dirt on it, can I wash it a second time and then throw it in the air fryer to heat it back up? I don\u2019t want to waste it.",
            "I bought a lb. of skin-on salmon that consisted of two fillets.  I removed these from the plastic tray they came in and placed them in a glass container in the freezer.  Now they are stuck to the glass container.  I want to thaw and eat only one fillet and leave the other in the freezer.  Does anyone know how I can achieve this, considering that they're stuck to the glass container?  I figure I will have to thaw the container with both fillets inside at once.",
            "I just finished thinning my 3 yr old apple trees.  Is it safe to use the baby apples to make pectin? I am wondering if there is too high a concentration of cyanide in under developed apples.",
            "I just ordered some mussels (St. Jacob scallops) ate like 2 and started to feel that they actually taste strange- like they left a bitter/spicy taste, as if I you'd eat a nutmeg or ginger (edit- i found a better comparison- as if you chew some rosemary leaves) that numb, lingering feel on the tongue. Waiter told me its cause they added some pepper, but damn I know the difference between hot as in spicy and tongue numbness you can get from some things. I know its mostly glassballing here, but how are the chances that these scallops were bad?",
            "I always put it in tupperware. Bacon has a tendency as any meat to oxidize quickly and become grey",
            "I've never had to soak asparagus - are you sure it wasn't just some seasoning making it gritty?\n\nFrom a food safety standpoint you're fine to rinse it and cook again, but it'll probably be overcooked",
            "Could it have been Szechuan pepper on them? That makes your mouth weirdly numb.",
            "I put it in a gallon ziplock bag so I can squeeze out all the extra air",
            "After I posted this I went and tried another piece and it was fine, I wonder if the first piece I tasted was slightly over looked when I rinsed them. I also may have over seasoned it and that was making it gritty, who knows."

Labor intensive stew (Latin Americams have each their own take and so do different households and reguons.

I have an apartment and can't even have a grill so it makes it extra enticing to go home for good barbecue!! He never cooked while I was growing up so this is a relatively recent hobby and my goodness we are so glad he ventured out.",
            "I just loved \"sloppy joe\" night.  Going wild with the tangy ground beef mix, scooped onto soft hamburger buns which nearly dissolved, and lots of pickle slices on the side as a \"vegetable\"  LOL.  1960's for the win, baby.",
            "For my kids who are 27 and 31 its my chicken and dressing ( my dressing is a mixture of half no sugar cornbread and toasted french bread. ). \nAll their friends who eat with us say it\u2019s the best. \nAlso, my homemade chicken and dumplings ( the flat rolled out dumplings not drop dumplings).  I made a big pot, put the leftover a big gallon bowl. My daughters boyfriend came over the next day.  They were missing. He ate the entire bowl. I was his music teacher, he said I didn\u2019t know my music teacher Mr C, could make the best Dumplings. \nToo funny.  \nNow he always ask me to make chicken and dumplings for him.",

And the sauce and ricotta was always well seasoned.\n\nThe other dish was her meatloaf. Yea j know, it's nothing really to write home about. But she always made a spcal sauce to go with it. It was just a ketchup glaze, either. It was a base of ketchup, brown sugar, worchestershire, and a bit of yellow mustard.",
            "My stepmother does a really, REALLY nice veal schnitzel with mushroom gravy.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s been my favourite since I was a child. It\u2019s one of the first things I asked her to teach me when I left home\u2026and I still don\u2019t get it right, so I come over for my schnitzel fix.",
            "My mom uses left over turkey and pinto beans from Thanksgiving and toss those into a crock pot with green bell pepper, corn, potatoes, green chile, and turkey stock... she calls it her \"green chile\" stew and it's very different than any green chile stew you can get at a New Mexican restaurant, but I crave it more than anything whenever fall hits. Tried like crazy to recreate it, so far no dice. It smells, tastes, and feels like home.",

            "Mom used to make French dip sandwiches the day after she'd make roast beef. No grocery store delis in those days where we lived.\n\nWhat I loved best was she would just make a whole bunch of sandwiches, not just one each, and serve them on her large cutting board. Eat as many as you could. \n\nThat was so good.\n\nDamn, I miss my mom.",

            "Lasagna, specifically my grandmother's recipe.\n\nGrandma also made a cookie that is just pie dough slathered in butter and cinnamon sugar, then rolled up into a pin wheel before baking. She called them Hoosier cookies. I think they go by many names depending on the region you're in. She brought them every Thanksgiving and the only person in the family she taught to make them is me.\n\nAlso my grandma's pumpkin pie. It's the original Libby's recipe on the side of the can. The one made with sugar and evaporated milk, NOT the one with condensed milk. The texture of the custard is so much softer and creamy as hell. My mom makes the condensed milk version and it just doesn't compare. \n\nI'm sure you can tell that I have much stronger memories of my grandmother's cooking. My mom is a good cook, but Grandma is the best.",
            "My mom used to make a dish we called \u201cCompany Pasta\u201d because she always made it when company came over. It\u2019s fast, easy, cheap, and delicious, and I have such intense nostalgia for it. I can still see the big bowl she served it in.\n\nIngredients:\nOne box pasta (we always did penne)\nOlive oil \nOne onion, chopped or diced \n4oz tomato paste (can or tube; can eyeball it)\nOne can diced tomatoes (whatever size you have)\nOne log goat cheese (6-8 oz to taste)\nPlenty of fresh basil, chopped\nSalt & pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\nBring water to a boil and salt generously.\n\nSaut\u00e9 onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt until translucent. Add in tomato parts and stir until onions are evenly coated. \n\nAdd pasta to water.\n\nAdd canned tomatoes to onion mixture and stir well. When the mixture bubbles add the goat cheese and stir occasionally until the cheese is completely melted. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and mix in the chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nCombine pasta and sauce in a large bowl and top with a few extra ribbons of basil if you have any left. Enjoy!",
            "I'm the Mom and Grandma who cooks what the kids want now.  They always ask for at least one of the following and if they are staying for a week? Well, let's just say that they get every single thing on the list before they go home.\n\nChicken and Dumplings  \nMaryland Spring Chicken  \nLasagna or Stuffed Shells  \nMexicali Casserole (an old casserole from the back of an egg noodle bag)  \nBaked Mac n Cheese  \nBeef Stew  \nSwiss Steak and Spaetzle\n\nBreakfast ALWAYS is my pancakes.  And for longer stays they also request biscuits and gravy.  And the spoiled brats usually talk me into making pizza for lunch, kettle corn for movie snacks and homemade ice cream with tarte tatin for dessert.  Yep, I said spoiled brats.  They have me wrapped around their little fingers and they know it!",
            "Honestly, anything. \n\nI'm in my 30's and to this day have never had a sit down meal with my parents/sibling, let alone a home cooked one. They were always working and when they weren't, neither really cooked. \n\nKids spell love T-I-M-E. Just build the memories when they get here and the rest will happen organically.",

I make my own now: I stuff as much lemon, onion, and garlic into a bird as I can, add a bay leaf if I'm feeling fancy, and if I'm feeling EXTRA fancy I will stick a spoon under the skin to loosen and then stud the breast with butter and chopped garlic (under the loosened skin). Roast at 400 until the meat thermometer says it's good.\n\nBonus: I also dream about Dad's classic summer barbecue...",
            "My favorite thing as a kid my mom made was meatloaf. Seasoned with french onion soup mix, oatmeal as the filler and a lot of ketchup. Now I make my own meatloaf from scratch and usually improvise the seasonings so it's different every time. As an adult I tried the old onion soup method and it was just ok. Mom was never a very good cook. Lots of Mac and cheese, hamburger helper and shake n bake.",

            "Stamppot or pannekoek.  \nStamppot is basically mashed potatoes seasoned with a little bit of vinegar, mixed together with veggies. You can top it with unsweetened applesauce or sauerkraut. My absolute comfort is broccoli and carrots with chicken sausage mixed in, topped with both sauerkraut and applesauce.  \nPannekoek is like a thick crepe. Growing up, it was bananas and whipped cream inside--which is still a favorite.  \nI know how to make stamppot, but I occasionally bother my mom to make pannekoek when I visit!",
            "For me, it\u2019s sopa de alb\u00f3ndigas which is a traditional Hispanic soup with meatballs with potatoes and other veggies.\n\nBy the way, the rice and gravy with the jalape\u00f1o Mac n cheese sounds so good",

            "Neither of my parents particularly like or excel at cooking, but my dad made some bomb ass chili when I was growing up. Super economical and infinitely adjustable, so he was able to dial it in. Also, like most stew-y  big-pot-of-stuff meals, it's even better as leftovers.\n\nHe doesn't remember his recipe, but I don't think that's important. Find a basic recipe and adjust it to your taste. Then, if/when you have a family you can adjust it further to better accommodate them. Maybe your kid loves animals and wants to be a vegetarian when they turn 8 (literally what happened with my sister) - no problem, take out the meat and put in black beans for protein. Maybe your SO hates onions - you should probably break it off because that's insane, but alternately, throw in some carrots to replace the sweetness you lose from sacrificing your onions.\n\nIt's hard to irreparably fuck up. It's cheap. It can feed a crowd. It can be about as healthy as you want without feeling like rabbit food. It doesn't need to be pretty.",
            "My dad learned how to make enchiladas. I always like them. we are not Mexican. they were nothing like restaurants but still good.\n\nboth my parents passed away years ago. They never made anything for me as an adult. I long surpassed them in the kitchen. If anything I cooked for them.",

            "Breakfasts were my favorite, cooking with my dad. Didn\u2019t matter what we were making. So when I visit, he and I always cook breakfast together. Most recently it was sausage/cream gravy over homemade biscuits, with hashbrowns made from freshly grated potatoes (I detest the frozen shredded crap) and eggs sunny side up. Totally gluttonous.",
            "Arroz con gandules",
            "My nana\u2019s meatloaf. The meatloaf itself is a pretty standard recipe I guess (although it does include curry powder, which is a little unusual) but the special sauce for basting it with is lit, never had another one like it.",

            "My mom does the best hamloaf. It's a very midwest dish. And then hamloaf sammys the next day, so good with crisp lettuce, mayo on white bread. My dad made the best pancakes. It was the only thing he could make besides steak but I miss his pancakes the most.",
            "If my mum were still alive I would ask for gnocchi and empanadas, both made entirely from scratch. On different days though because one of those is enough for a day!",
            "Pasta Salad. It was omnipresent at Mom's side family affairs. I've had the recipe passed down, but somehow it's never tasted as good as Mom's, which also never tasted as good as Grandma Betty's.\n\nFettucine al dente, diced tomato, green bell, summer sausage. Wishbone Italian Dressing. McCormick Salad Supreme.\n\nWishbone/McCormick circa 1993 are very different products than their current offerings, unfortunately.\n\nI've been a fan of the recipe for 35 years, I'll continue to be a fan for 35 more. And you can bet I'm experimenting every single time I make it to get as close as possible to that 90s pasta salad vibe.\n\nThus concludes the Ode To Grandma's Noodles.\n\nEdit: Runner up, Mom's Lasagna. When you smell that tomato-wine-cheese combo walking in after school, you know it's about to be a good night and you better get your homework done fast so you can be early to the kitchen and get a good corner piece.",

            "My mom had this insanely good recipe she called Chicken Dijon. We have no idea what the recipe was sadly.\n\nWe lost my mom at a fairly young age to cancer. My mom was a military wife and mother of a big family so all recipes were long-since stretched with other ingredients to save money and feed growing kids. For the longest time her cancer treatments seemed to be going ok so we had false hope. By the time anyone thought to ask about recipes she had lost the ability to speak or really comprehend.

            "My parents are passed on but when I was a kid my Mom would experiment with different variations of Cottage and Shepherd's Pie. She finally settled on one that was tomato based but I actually ended up making up my own which was a beef gravy based one.\n\nI also like to make Chicken and Dumplings and Chili Pie with a corn bread topping. I like meat based casseroles, stews, soups, pot pies, stuff like that. I'm also big on hand held meat pastry pies and have about a dozen different ones I like to make from different countries. \n\nWhen my Dad was still alive before he got sick and lost all interest in food I used to make different casseroles and meat pies because I knew he'd at least try those and it was real food unlike the Stouffer's meals he'd practically live on if you let him. \n\nMy Mom rarely cooked except on holidays. Most of the time I ended up cooking for myself and later I'd end up just making big pots of pasta sauce, stews, chili or soups so they would eat real food too. Otherwise they'd just exist on eggs and sausages or bacon for breakfast and whatever bar food was available any given night at whatever place they ended up doing Happy Hour at. \n\nI was cooking whole meals by the time I was 10. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks. My Mom taught me a little. She wasn't a bad cook most of the time but I'd say at least 3/4 of her recipes involved boxes or cans and rarely more than a few steps. She never really cooked much from scratch. \n\nI am admittedly lazy when it comes to making baked goods from scratch. I will often start with a mix and add stuff rather than start from scratch and sift flour and all that. But mostly when it comes to eating regular food I like to cook mostly from scratch from fresh ingredients. \n\nThe only major cheat when I am cooking stuff like soup is that is I do like Better Than Bouillon and will always add some even when I make stock from a chicken. I don't mind chicken stock but I like it a bit richer and thicker, and I get that with the BTB stuff. \n\nMy soups are always hearty with thicker broth like stews or chowders. With rare exceptions I don't like thin broth soups much. \n\nThese days I have to watch carbs because I'm diabetic so I have to work around the potato/crust thing. I can't make things like Cottage Pie or Pot Pies as much as I used to. I tend to make chili and soup more. Every once in a while though I've still got to have some kind of meat pie.\n\nI'm definitely a meat and potatoes/pasta person. Most of my favorite down home meals involve one or the other so restricting myself to a more low carb diet can be hard...",

Look up Andrew Zimmern's recipe; he has recipes for it in a number of places, all of which are different from each other. (The only problem is it requires boiling noodles which puts a lot of steam into your kitchen.)\n\n*Wurstsalat* is a cold and filling meal and it keeps well if you want to make a huge batch of it and eat it for multiple meals. I've made it a number of times with varying levels of authenticity in the ingredients and no matter how you make it, it's all good. Just make sure your wurst is precooked as this is a no-cook recipe. I recommend using a better pickle with this rather than a low end one. (Note: you don't have to cut things into sticks if it doesn't make sense. As long as most ingredients are about the same size, it's okay if you slice the sausage into rounds/use precut pickle chips/etc.) [https://www.daringgourmet.com/swiss-wurstsalat-sausage-salad/](https://www.daringgourmet.com/swiss-wurstsalat-sausage-salad/) Feel free to double the dressing if you like. We like to pair a crusty bread with it for some carbs and to dip up the juices afterward.\n\nFor slow cooker, I do a pork shoulder with Puerto Rican & Cuban flavors. I double the mojo from [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/cuban-roast-pork-shoulder-mojo-recipe) (but only put half on it), cook the pork via [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/puerto-rican-pernil-slow-cooker-recipe), then go back to the first recipe to pull the pork & make the sauce with the leftover mojo. It's even better if you add fresh cilantro for the sauce, but still totally delicious without it. Makes a ton and the leftovers are spectacular: freeze 'em for later or have fantastic tacos on day 2 or 3.\n\nAnd there's always the idea of a some kind of *grazing tray* for dinner. Some combination of charcuterie, cheese board, crudit\u00e9s, relish tray, with some kind of flatbread (or crackers) and dips or spreads. You can go Italian antipasto, you can go Middle Eastern/Mediterranean mezze, you can go German with Abendbrot or Brotzeit, you can go Korean with a bunch of banchan or Spanish tapas inspired, or mix it up with whatever you have in the fridge. I try to keep meats, cheeses, crackers, pickles, dips, and fruits (dried or fresh) and nuts around specifically for this kind of easy but flavorful meal.\n\nYou can do as much or as little actual cooking as you like. Like for the mezze I might make falafel (or heat up some premade kibbe from Trader Joe's) but everything else is premade; if I'm really feeling like cooking, I may make my own [hummus](https://www.foodiewithfamily.com/homemade-hummus/) (so easy, so cheap, makes a ton, you can vary it a million ways) or baba ganoush (which is basically hummus, sub the chick peas for roasted eggplant) as well. But if all you want to do is buy stuff and arrange it, that's totes valid as well & I do it too.\n\nBut my old standby for eating while being hot, it's hard to go wrong with *pimento cheese spread sandwiches* and cubes of cold *cantaloupe* from the fridge. Maybe even have some *gazpacho* if you're feeling fancy, or switch out the sandwiches for some *Saint Andre cheese* (goes AMAZING with sweet ripe cantaloupe.)\n\nAnd, for my money, nothing beats a good cold *tuna salad sandwich*. ;)",

I meal prep what I can on Sunday for the family. \nThin sliced steaks - sometimes called \"minute\" steaks(as is or sliced for salad)\nBadia Complete Chicken/thin sliced pork loin (salad & sandwiches) \n(Badia Complete is somewhat similar to Mrs.Dash)\nBbq chicken (as is or diced for BBQ sub sandwichs)\nMinced beef & cheese sub sandwich (Philly sub style)\nPasta salad \nChicken tacos (crock pot meal)\nBbq ribs ( crock pot then air fryer)\nCrock pot pulled pork sandwiches or nachos\nBeef tacos or nachos\nWe eat just about anything BUT hamburgers and hot dogs on 100 degree days.",
