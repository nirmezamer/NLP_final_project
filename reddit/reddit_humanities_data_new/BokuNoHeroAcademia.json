            "Anyone got any theories on who the guy shuffling around in the street was?\n\n\nLooks like he was tied up with some sort of straight jacket and mask and those scissors were used to cut him loose.",
            "\"Hey uraraka can we talk?\"\n\n\"Your new haircut sucks I'm sorry\"",
            "Finally Shoto says something!  \n  \nI liked his introspective thoughts on how AFO was born and came to power during chaotic times.  \n  \nIt seems that Deku both noticed how Uraraka and Shoto still have some emotional baggage from the war. Uraraka seems to be forcing herself to appear like her old cheerful self, while Shoto is probably ready to see his brother in that giant Bacta tank at the end.",
            "All those people who said Shinso will replace somebody in class 1A was correct....\n\n\n\n\nExcept instead of it being Mineta like they had wanted it was Aoyama lol",
            "Hori\u2019s gonna fuck around and make this epilogue at least two volumes (I\u2019m very much okay with that)",
            "Is the crying person in the second last page someone we know or is that someone new",
            "A new chapter begins?! Year 2 baybeeeeee we'll see who this scissor wielding character is and probably check in on all the villains who have survived.",
            "Why do I feel like Hori is more excited to write the epilogue than he was writing the final arc?",
            "Horikoshi mixing in some tension and mystery even into the epilogue, nice.\n\nInb4 that's not a life support system for Dabi but a generator built around him \"Hey it's free clean blue seeth energy.\"",
            "Can't see his face but Endeavor probably looks down as fuck seeing Toya like that.\n\nBut at least he's keeping an eye on him like he promised when he torched AFO.",
            "Any ideas on who this mystery character walking the streets by them self is?",
            "Man imagine your crush telling you that your old hair was better \ud83d\udc80",
            "Mawata Fuwa:...Wait, I actually get screentime now going forward?\n\nHori: Moreso by default with the trio gone! GL!",
            "\"So yeah, we're going to have to delay that big romantic payoff until you don't look like the background drummer in a third-rate punk rock band\"",
            "I predicted that endeavor was going to quit as a hero, but my prediction was wrong.\n\nEndeavor is in a wheelchair so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be in a hero.\n\n I guess it depends, if he\u2019s going to have those robotic legs.",
            "Come on Uraraka, just come out and say it. You two have both been at deaths door. Now is the best time to just say it!!",
            "Vote Nezu for Prime Minister of Japan!\n\nHave no worries Mirio, you'll be fine, you're Japan's Ass after all.\n\nDr. Yoshi was worried about Bakugo's heart, he has to \"take it easy\"... does it mean he has to keep calm and not scream, to not risk an heart attack? Is this heaven?\n\nLooks like Jirou has a prosthetic for a whole lost earlobe.\n\nAdieu, Aoyama :( Even announcing his leave while introducing his replacement.\n\nMineta didn't seem to act lewd but I understand if Aizawa wanted to be safe. \n\nAll that focus on Mawata Fuwa now, revealed as even some top student and leader of her year, is so funny. Hori introduced her and 2-A in Ch.254, gave her a profile page saying \"will they ever appear again? You can bet they will\". Then nothing but her cameo in Ch.422. Hard to shake off the impression that Hori didn't get time and opportunity to feature her a bit more. I didn't want to be reminded of the Aizawa expulsion retcon, though.\n\nOchako acts far too happy-go-lucky, and Izuku is looking through that. Meanwhile, my dear... just shave the whole hair off and let it regrow evenly.\n\n\"Hello Endeavor, Dabi's leftovers are in that fridge\" - Looks next chapter is going to be for the Todorokis. 10th anniversary incoming (and a possible additional reason for the extended break this time).",
            "Hm. Part of me wonders whether we're gonna get a timeskip where we get to see everyone as proper heroes in the final few chapters - like, something about Jiro just having a prosthetic over her missing ear and no one commenting on it, nor anyone commenting on anyone else's new scars sorta bugs me? Not as much as other minor things that've happened in the final few legs of the story, but still!",
            "Bakugo trying to remain calm so his heart doesn\u2019t give out again lmao. \n\nTodofam stuff feels like it\u2019s gonna be heavy\u2026",
            "Dabi/ Toya still being alive is hilarious. Like that man has been a barbecue stick for years I guess nothing\u2019s gonna affect it. \n\nGood to see the big three made it\n\nOchaco with what\u2019s important lol\n\nCould that be Shigaraki or all for one?! Dun dun dunnnn. All for one with a back up back up back up plan.",
            "Horikoshi sorry but you ain't gonna make Mawata Fuwa work when you don't give her much screentime to show off her character before this. Seriously I've seen people saying they have to google her name to know who she is.\n\nDecent ending for the Big 3, Aoyama decided to not join class 2-A and being replaced by Shinsou, and Shoto/Uraraka decided to not express their feelings. Pretty good chapter.",
            "I loved Mirio's speech, extremely poignant\n\n  \nThe \"running\" gag was pretty hilarious too. Esp coming off Ep 4 \n\n  \nGod Bless",
            "This was a very great heavily dialogue chapter!\n\nI love the fact that this chapter is releasing where everyone is graduating \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI love that funny little anime classic gag, where everyone was falling backwards \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt was great to see the whole students be together in class, again \n\nIt\u2019s sad to see Aoyama leave \ud83e\udd72 but nice that we will have Shinso for UA!\n\nAlso damn Endeavor is in the wheelchair and Dabi looks like he might be in a very bad state \ud83d\udc80",
            "It is maybe a little bit jarring going from the first years being enormous contributors in literally saving the world to being like, \"Oh man it's crazy we're senpais now\"\n\nBut I guess that's kind of the point of heroes-as-a-profession where you just have to wake up and get back to work (or school) the next day regardless",
            "One big question that is left hanging and unanswered (though of course I expect it to be addressed in the next few chapters) -- with Deku effectively Quirkless, does he continue at U.A. ? We know he's got embers of OFA left. Curious to see what kind of resolution there is:\n\n* Unlike All Might who was injured critically, and because OFA was powered up even more by the time Deku passed it on, he will had plenty of Embers left for a whole Hero career\n* He'll have to be careful with limited Embers and will only be a Hero long enough to help rebuild and/or establish his friends as new Symbols, then retire after graduating U.A.\n* He'll somehow have a Quirk going forward (either Shiggy passed along something with the final fist bump, or Deku gets rewinded, or Embers shenanigans end up staying permanently, or Awakening a new Quirk, whatever)",
            "Is that meant to be Dabi/Toya in the final panel?\n\nDoesn't look like him.",
            "Wait Dabi survived? Also who was the guy before? Guess this is the period of chaos with everybody scarred from the chaos.",
            "Real question because I guess I wasn\u2019t paying attention enough but like they said that Edgeshot was going to die to save Bakugo, but did he cause like he was around for quite a while is he still alive or is he dead and part of Bakugo? Or is just part of him part of Bakugo",
            "You know after thinking on it, what if that mystery character is a character we don\u2019t know who is supposed to be the new AFO/new villain born in a world of chaos like Shoto talked about. \n\nBut this time he\u2019s saved by Deku before he ever goes that far not letting him fall into the wrong hands like Tenko did with AFO. \n\nI loved this chapter overall and it seems like the epilogue will be long and I\u2019m absolutely here for it.",
            "I'm so excited to see what Hori does with Uraraka and Deku here. This is around the time shonen couples get set off on a green flag. So I'm interested to see what he does here. \n\nAlso, her dissing his terrible haircut is the highlight of the chapter for me.",
            "So it seems we can say the Final War Arc is over. What do we call this arc now? The Reconstruction Arc? The Epilogue Arc?",
            "Just like the Sports Festival, Ochaco puts on a cheerful front but Deku knows it\u2019s not how she really feels. She\u2019s upset over Toga. Unlike the Sports Festival, Deku will successfully comfort her.\n\nIf Dabi\u2019s alive, it\u2019s ironic. The villain who wanted to die the MOST is the one who lives in a fate worse than death, utterly failing in his goal. While Shiggy and Toga both die, they do so peacefully and with dignity, after doing at least one good deed and getting what they wanted (acceptance for who she is, being reassured that the society that created him is destroyed).",
            "Plenty of other people have said it, but the new guy is definitlely some 'villain in the making' who will be saved by the new society/heroes post Shigaraki. He's walking up a flight of stairs in the panel where his hand is on the wall, so he's probably been tied up in someone's basement and is now free due to the destruction. Some people have said he's wearing a straitjacket, but I reckon those things around his neck look like zip-ties.",
            "Jeez!! Uraraka literally pulled a Lamar on Deku cuz of his yee yee ass haircut",
            "As *cute* as no-anger-Bakugo is... **I hope it IS only for recovery period.** Lol \n\nBattle [raging](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0409-010.png)\u00a0 [feral](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0405-015.png)\u00a0 [Bakugo](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0406-010.png)\u00a0 [goes](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0409-003.png)\u00a0 [hard](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0410-004.png)\u00a0 as [FUCK](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GCLRsJRWkAAawmh.jpg:large) & was [PEAK](https://scans-hot.leanbox.us/manga/Boku-No-Hero-Academia/0405-016.png) manga content. Absolute savage. It's a standout in the way Hori draws him & no other student is like this (& goes back much more than JUST during finale). \n\nPlus, Horikoshi didn't give Bakugo much personality besides [ANGRY. ](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/c8/0e/83/c80e83ce1c5986def57bb4080eda5e77.jpg) [FOUL. ](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/3a/49/65/3a49655b1cf7981033626fe6e3fdcb6b.jpg) - [MOUTHED. ](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/17/0a/7c/170a7cd7a0c9d9e820db9d4455a54f21.jpg)  [GOBLIN](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c4/2a/73/c42a73f7781d6313a5769953da248aff.jpg). Lol So, without it, he's just... chill & in bed by 8:32pm \ud83d\ude06 \n\nI always loved the idea of \n\n- him softening a bit, \n\n- but still remaining the resident asshole \n\n- horrible at press interviews, \n\n- with an angry loud potty mouth, \n\n- grumpily helping his friends, \n\n- helping civillians while \"USE YER FUCKING HEADS\" & [\"NO, I don't want your free cakes!!\"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYy3zn1XsA417Bu.jpg) Lol \n\n**It was fun to imagine kids cheering him on as parents GASP & cover their ears.** \ud83e\udd2d \n\nI thought he reached almost a perfect balance in Deku Retrieval arc. So, I'm hoping he goes back *some*, eventually.",
            "Looks like next chapter will be the Todofam resolution, really hope all the major plot lines get similar attention. There\u2019s a lot left unresolved.",
            "The way Shouto words his lines here makes me wonder if they\u2019ll be turning Dabi life support off. Or maybe that\u2019s the intention but he wakes up somehow. I could see Endeavor and Touya living in the I first home while the rest of the family lives in the new one that was constructed (unless it was destroyed in the war).",
            "View in your timezone:  \n[June 30th at 8AM PDT][0]  \n\n[0]: https://timee.io/20240630T1500?tl=Chapter%20425%20Official%20Release%20-%20Links%20and%20Discussion\n\n\n^(_*Assumed PDT instead of PST because DST is observed_)",
            "I like that Ochako and Shoto are trying not to worry Deku even though they're obviously the most traumatized classmates... I would love these two to have ONE actual conversatio  before the manga ends since their both important to the protagonist and have quite a lot in common. Actually I'd love an update on Toga too, is she dead? Looks like Dabi is still alive for now, maybe not for long though.",
            "First, Mineta didn\u2019t deserve that from Aizawa, all he did was call Toru a goddess. Not to mention he\u2019s grown from his initial pervyness.\n\n\nSecond. People say that might be some new villain at the end of the chapter, but personally, I feel like it\u2019s meant to be a parallel to Shiggy. It being a kid who\u2019s just lost his family, who might have been a bad one, which would be why we see a panel of a front door to a house. But I think they\u2019ll be used to signify the change in hero soviet from this, by someone actually helping this kid. Preferably not a hero, since it\u2019ll reinforce the point that not only heroes need to be better, but society as a whole",
            "Ngl, I was laughing my ass off when everyone fell on their backs for the gag and then continued being on their backs with serious expressions during Mirio's speech.",
            "That last page is almost 1 to 1 of what I imagined \"post war\" Endeavor going to Dabi be like. The only difference is that I thought that Dabi will be able to respond to him.",
            "Was that endeavor on the last panel?",
            "All I\u2019m gonna say is the mystery man looks very much like Tenko, right down to the scar under his right eye. I personally think it is Tenko, but only time will tell.",
            "This really didn't feel like part of an epilogue, but like a new arc entirely. It's kind of weird. I wonder if we're still on track for it ending. It's possible that Hori changed his mind over this past year (plus this is a cash cow).\n\n\nI know it probably won't happen, but I'd love if the series continued as a more slice of life and fluffy story. I don't know that it even needs Hori to be heavily involved for that to happen at this point. He could take on a more consulting role while someone new takes over.\u00a0\n\n\nI know I'm high on copium here, it would just be nice to see the kids graduate and have a happy life, and we get to see society heal and improve. If any series deserved a Boruto treatment (Beku?) or a long running anime of the studio just doing original content, it would be MHA.\u00a0",
            "I can't lie, I was waiting for an instant confession from Uraraka and was so upset at the distancing. But, funnily enough, what I wanted would have rung hollow\n\n  \nThey need, not just her and Deku, but all of the to process that while they succeeded, they don't feel like it. They need to address their current situations. Would like to see their development individually and together from this point\n\nGod Bless",
            "I feel so vindicated by understanding Horikoshi's writing style enough to know that even though he's working towards the end of the story, he *still introduces new stuff into the story.* Now we have this mysterious person and it begs the question of how long this epilouge will be and what their usage in the story will be lol\n\nOther than that, another great chapter for the epilouge arc. Mirio's speech was great, and I love how his character consistently reinforces the message that laughter and smiles will be what leads to a bright future. I love seeing the graduation, esp since Tamaki had a hopeless feeling and thought they wouldn't live to see it.\n\nShinso is in class 2A and that's real cool. I'm sad Aoyama is leaving *but* I think it's a good decision in the end. I like how he's another character alongside Endeavor and Bakugo who seeks atonement as a way to improve themselves. Him leaving doesn't mean he gives up as a hero either, but feels like he wants to restart things by his own volition, and I respect that a lot.\n\nI think we're building up to something with Deku given that panel we had of him after Mawata Fuwa talks about understanding the reason to be a hero, and Deku isn't able to have a proper conversation with Todoroki or Uraraka given their similar circumstances trying to save their respective villains.",
            "Do you guys think 1) it's ending, or 2) this was the first saga of a longer story leading to something better, since Horikoshi has some storytelling practice and has established pretty big popularity? I'm personally hoping it's the latter, as I thought the story was needlessly truncated in places and should have been longer.",
            "Tamaki being an adorable bean as always.\n\nWow that Mirio speech was so emotional \ud83d\ude22 dang \n\nFarewell Yuga Aoyama I'm going to miss his fabulous personality\n\nAwesome Shinso join the class.\n\nAgreed with Ochako that hairstyle seriously need to go.\n\nWho is this mysterious guy walking? A potential new villian perhaps?\n\nPoor Endeavor seeing Toya in that state must be heartbreaking for him.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable chapter.",
            "Who is the person waking in the rubble at the end?",
            "Good god it feels like it\u2019s been forever since we last saw the class in a classroom doing school shit since the cultural festival and joint training arcs! \n\n\u2026\u2026.Damn I feel old now for some reason! lol \n\nHmm I wonder who this new villain is and what he can do? \n\nYay shinso is now in class 1A(2A now!) \n\nAnd now the long awaited conclusional epilogue keeping up with the todoroki! XD \n\nAnd holy shit THREE WEEKS!",
            "So\u2026 how is deku still in the hero course? Isn\u2019t he quirkless again? Or does the ember he talked about give him residual powers like it did for All Might? I reckon it\u2019s just because he sacrificed his powers to save everyone they were like yeah sure stay in the class.",
            "also hero society hasn't changed because deku reached out to a villain, it has changed because now, there's no being of nearly infinite ability to interfere in peoples lifes getting in the way of people getting help.\n\nbecause say what you want, no one raising their voice to alert a random cop or hero of that weird bleeding child only makes sense if afo was floating in the sky using some quirk to stop people from doing so. because if you invested months, maybe years in fucking with one of your arch enemies families, you're not gonna leave it up to fate if someone demands a hero or cop takes care of this little freak. \nwhich is actually the go to reaction of normal people in this hero society. you raise your voice about something being wrong and then someone alerts heroes and they come",
            "I've seen the theory that this black haired guy is just some rando who has the potential to become a villain due to the circumstances society finds itself in being similar to when AFO was born, and Deku will be able to \"save\" this person from going down a dark path, somehow alleviating his dour mood. I feel like this would be a fake-out of astronomical proportions as you're undoubtedly supposed to think of Tenko when this guy appeared in the chapter. The black hair, the covered mouth, the focus on the hand at the start, the character literally walking out of the darkness anew, the way it appears right before we get an update on the League. It would also be like handing Deku another consolation cope prize like All Might did last chapter when he's obviously torn up over Tenko specifically.\n\nThe overhaul theory sounds truly conspiracy-ish but when I lay it all out it makes a lot of sense to me. Shigaraki professed that he still wanted to be the hero to the league even after losing his hate, hate that was forced onto him by AFO. This moment just straight up hasn't been addressed in the narrative. Deku heard that from Shigaraki and it's likely a big reason why he's so unfulfilled now. So then the question remains how will it be used? Well I think the answer is simple, he is gonna save the league.\n\nLets play out how perfectly the restoration quirk awakening would be. First, it's another plan by AFO blowing up in his face. It's kind of messed up how AFO controlled Tenko's life from his birth to his death. AFO was the reason he had to die. This has always been something that didn't sit right with me because the victim having to die due to the abuser just ain't right. I expected Shiggy to die going into this arc but not caught in the crossfire like he was. If the overhaul quirk awakened into it's restoration side then it would be a final middle finger to AFO.\n\nNext, in this chapter we can see that Dabi is more than likely not dead. This is big because it was always up in air about whether or not he would be dead when he was scorched to the bone. But if he's alive, why? So we can watch them pull the plug? We already got Endeavor crawling to his \"dying\" son begging Dabi to let him have it. That seemed like a perfect moment to kill him. Yet he's still alive seemingly, why? Because his physical state is so dire only something incredible could save him, like the restoration side of overhaul. Spinner as well. Who would be able to remove his excess quirks? I assume Toga is in a bad state as well, easy fix. This is how he can become their heroes. We can also receive that line that I think many of us who are invested in the Deku/Shiggy dynamic wanted to hear but never got, \"You can still be a hero\". Answers another question, where the heck was Tenko's rising ch when every other character who got an origin received a rising. I assume, if this theory comes true, that the chapter where overhaul awakens or he saves the league would be, \"Tenko Shimura Rising\".\n\nIt's also a perfect capstone to Shigaraki's line of thinking, \"why was I born with these hands that destroy?\". Shigaraki went through the entire story doubling down on this idea that all he can do is destroy, so it would be the perfect irony if he ends the series with hands that can restore as well. These are just the thoughts that have been swimming in my brain since the leaks. I'm not fully convinced, because as I said it is undoubtedly conspiracy-ish, but I see the vision.\n\nEdit: This also leaves out what Mirio is talking about in this chapter the turning of a negative back into a zero, not even a positive. The chapter from before the war where we check in on the league before the battle is titled, \"The Story of how we all Became Heroes, Part -1\". I think if the theory is correct then this just gives the game away. This chapter has never gotten a follow up despite the hero version getting repeated entries through the war. My theory is that this is because we will get a chapter titled something long the lines of, \"The Story of how we all Became Heroes, Part 0\". I assume this will symbolic of the league after they've been saved, \"starting at zero\" from the negative that was their villainy. It wouldn't surprise me if the last chapter where we see the league is titled this as a capstone to their journey.\u00a0",
            "All Dabi ever wanted was for Endeavor to look at him\u2026. Now he\u2019s finally looking at him when it\u2019s too late\u2026 damn Hori is a poet",
            "So Dabis in that machine\nbut anyway wonder who that new guy is. probs some new dude for deku to save tbh\n\nbut hope manga doesn't end here at 2A",
            "For a second I thought we'd time-skipped to 3rd year, but phew, it was just the senpais' graduation. I bet the new 1st years are thinking they dodged a bullet.\n\nDeku and Uraraka look like they've got a LOT on their minds with all those close up shots.\n\nThank god class a still have Eraserhead as homeroom teacher, we're not ready for that to change after 10 years of status quo. Much of the environment has changed, but that much has stayed the same and it'd be too weird to change now.",
            "I have no idea whats going on, this chapter was a little all over the place",
            "Awww, Nejire is too cute\n\nSad to see Ayoama leave, but nice to see Shinso finally become a full member of the class. Thinking about it, also interesting to see Deku still in the class. I wonder if he still has any embers at this point\n\nSetting up a new villain(s)? But crying, mouth covered, while in a straight jacket\n\nAnd who's the person in front of the TV? Endeavor? \n\nWonder how many more chapters as a whole will be? Can't wait for 426 on the 30th\n\n6/18 EDIT: So I just thought of this, I can't call them class 1.5A anymore lol",
            "Damn, Dabi's alive after all that?\n\nSo people are thinking the guy stumbling near the end is a new antagonist for the next arc? I thought he might be spinner but without all his scales or whatever.",
            "do you think that we'll get to see the new first years and third years? I was always super disappointed we never got to see any previous second years except for like 1 or 2 characters! The fact that none of them were significant enough to appear in the final war makes the world feel a lot smaller to me.",
            "What if it is actually Deku's father? He's been gone long enough and the little we know about him is that he breathes fire, mouth covering, what if Inko rarely talked about him because he ended up being a villain and she found out after they got married and left after finding out about her pregnancy. Then, he was attracted to AFO because of his power and ended up in max security early on. When the jail break happened, it's possible that he wandered about trying to follow AFO but was unable to find out info and another villain or the heteromorphs captured him or something similar which brings us to him escaping finally. Or it's not remotely related to the Midoriya's, and it'll be someone who is on their breaking point but gets saved before going full symbol of evil.",
            "So is this it for Deku? The final embers of OFA will burn out after a few months and he'll be quirkless. I know he already became the world's strongest hero and saved the world, but seeing as the end of this chapter foreshadowed another villain entering the scene, it's kind of disappointing to see Deku losing his power. I know it's already been debated to hell and back whether Deku should end the series with a quirk or not, but personally I think he should. He's a hero, he'll never be satisfied as long as there are people out there who need saving and he can't help them. \n\nAnyway, I'm sure Horikoshi will work something out, but it really doesn't look like he'll be getting even a fraction of his peak power back.",

MHA is an immensely bankable property for its rights holders and it\u2019d be very fitting for the torch to be passed to someone new, just like when one run on a comic book ends and another begins. Personally, I\u2019d be invested in seeing our heroes make it through years 2 and 3, especially with potential relationship developments like Deku and Ochako, and Denki and Kyoka (maybe even Katsuki and Ejiro, god willing). I think I expected everything to be wrapped up neatly following the defeat of the villains but I\u2019m glad it hasn\u2019t, even if it isn\u2019t to set up a successor. You don\u2019t bring about societal change just by physical beating the worst actors.

Midoriya's feeling the effects of everything that's happened and especially of not really being able to save Shigaraki like he wanted to since it was far too late for that, so perhaps being able to help this guy is what gives him a direction he needs for the future in regards to how to try and fix the flaws in hero society.",

This leads to Shiggy Vestige revealing itself to Deku and saying the guy is wrong. \n\nDeku then accidentally uses decay on the guys mask, and Shiggys vestige says some form of \u201cyou need a way to fight, but you also need a power as kind as you\u201d and deku then uses his other hand to regen the villains injury, and Talk No Jutsu\u2019s him into redemption \n\nThen using the fully decay/regen quirk from shiggy Deku goes and heals Spinner who recognizes his friend Shiggy is there.",

So, suddenly, \"Shigi's timetable sped up\".  We rushed straight into the Dark Deku arc, which while good marked Deku pretty quickly coming back to UA.  But because we skipped what should have been months, Deku wasn't ready to deal with Complete Shigi.  So, here comes Star to \"weaken\" Shigi in a pretty cool, but unmeasurable way ... that the story likely didn't really need.  Before she was killed off, with her \"Problematic on a Writing Level\" quirk.\n\nMy genuine guess, at least in original concept, is that there was supposed to be a more robust \"Deku Gone\" arc in between Paranormal War and Dark Deku.  Going: Paranormal -> Deku Away -> Dark Deku -> UA Traitor -> Final War.  With parts of \"Deku Away\" being clunkily thrown into later parts of the story, and Stars and Stripes being the hammer to smash the story onto the new rails to the Final War.",

AFO said they stripped Overhaul until it was only Decay but like.. you know, it's AFO. The guy who has plans blow up in his face all the time. His arc is essentially defined by it. If the theory were to be true then we wouldn't be talking about decay. This is another thing too, the theory assumes a quirk awakening. We don't know what Overhaul could do after a quirk awakening. Obviously this is the weakest part of the theory, because it assumes something we could not possibly know atm, but that is the thought process. \n\nWe are just gonna have to agree to disagree about the physical similarities.

It was the characters, their interactions, the humor, basically all the beats between the action sequences.

            "I'm in actual awe of Dabi's voice actor's ability to manipulate his voice so precisely. Incredible work.",
            "Shoto\u2019s crying in the next week preview, I can\u2019t take it. This fight must\u2019ve hurt him on a very deep personal level. Dabi absolutely trashed Shoto with everything that he has, the voice actor did a perfect job portraying Dabi\u2019s hatred and jealousy toward his \u201cperfect replacement\u201d really well.\n\nI like how the anime expands more on Toya\u2019s mental breakdown. The kid got it rough even before he stir-fried himself into oblivion.\n\nAnd we still have Todoroki Family Epilogue next week, the timing is absolutely nuts.",
            "Dabi and Shoto's VAs totally killed it in this ep!!",
            "You know what? Its Good! I bet they are going to cook more when Dabi Awakens",
            "DIRECTION\n\nOST\n\nVOICE ACTING\n\nCONSISTENT ART\n\nGOOD MOVEMENT \n\nHoly shit.... I actually felt something in my bones similar to Season 1-3.... very powerfully made episode. I'm very happy with this new direction we have",
            "Dabi's backstory was done wonderfully, the whole atmosphere was done so well and it was even expanded. His emotions and devastation were palpable.\n\nThis was definitely the best animated episode so far. The fight itself had moments which I loved, especially Dabi's moves. But I gotta say I was a little underwhelmed with how Shoto's Glacial Aegir was animated, didnt look much like a ultimate move. It wasnt bad at all, but fell flat compared to the previous atacks. I think it needed a little more impact.\n\nStill definitely a very good episode especially on the emotional delivery. The voice actors were absolutely fantastic.\n\nVery curious how much they are adapting next episode, are they doing the whole endeavor fight or split it in two episodes. I think it would be best to do it all in one episode. And since a new poster for the episode was released to promote it I think that will be the case. A lot of the very strong animators werent used this episode either so I am also expecting them to appear either on the Endeavor or Bakugo episode. And both are great choices, although personally I would prefer Endeavor to have a little more love animation wise (I absolutely love his fight).",
            "The dabi vs todoroki fight ends in the anime and the closure for the todoroki family is happening in the epilogue chapters of the manga next week. Coincidence? \n\nI think NOT! lol but no I\u2019m actually being serious here am I crazy or what?\n\nAlso this Agni Kai was the best one since zuko vs azula! XD",
            "THAT WAS INSANE",

            "shoto's final move felt like it lacked spectacle and impact, kind of a bummer. Him doing it twice made me think the second time would be the one they animated 10/10 but no, kinda dull twice",
            "they cooked fr the child scene literally made me cry bro",
            "Man the voice actors was amazing this week\ud83d\udd25",
            "The best part of Dabi is, when he woke up he wanted to apologize to Rei and others for his behavior, he was even willing to give up his desire to be a hero just to see a healthy family.Dabi himself said that he only wanted Endeavor to be good, he didn't care about others.",
            "Almost every fire move felt dull and different compared to the manga hell spider, jet burn and especially glacial aegir that was completely different from the manga\u00a0\n\n\nAnimation level was slightly above average honestly\u00a0\n\n\n\n8/10 at best for this adaptation\u00a0",

            "I could feel the heat and anger through my TV it was so powerful.\n\n\nUsing the Kimi No Chikara ost for this fight was nothing short of perfect.\n\n\n\nTo think this just the tip of the iceberg of firepower any of the Todorokis are bringing this season. It's going to be insane when Dabi wakes up",
            "I'm seeing comments about the ultimate move being underwhelming, but what? That was insane. It was a mix of peaceful and powerful at the same time. I thought it was amazing. Easily top 10 episode of the whole series. They really did an amazing job on this. Can't wait to get the BluRay and have it undimmed.",
            "Hori how did that sunflower dude survive that fire?\u00a0\n\n\nThe fade Dabi was running on Shoto was RUTHLESS. Poor kid, gotta deal with one of the worst father\u2019s AND brother\u2019s in this verse.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Loved all the flashbacks to help the moment build-up. Shoto calling out Dabi for making his own choices to kill with a flashback of him murdering was perfect. The fight was good but final move was slightly underhwhelming. Animation is either being saved for Endeavor fight or Gearshift.",
            "SHOTO'S SMILE. My soul and heart omfg.  \nOkay, me fangirling aside. What a stellar episode.",
            "what a fantastic episode! All of it!",
            "They nailed the backstory and the voice acting but I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed in the fight a little. Both shotos and dabis attacks don\u2019t feel as powerful as they looked in the manga.",
            "everything perfect besides the actual fighting. oh well",

            "Agreed. Shimono Hiro deserves WAY more appreciation and recognition for his work as Dabi alone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHe's definitely one of my favourite voice actors by far and he always puts his everything in every role he plays.\u00a0\n\n\nHis screams in this episode legitimately gave me chills and made my jaw drop with how raw and primal the emotions in his voice were.",
            "I agree as well in the timing cause that doesn\u2019t just happen.",
            "Bro those punches were BRUTAL! Shoto has every right to hate this dude, worst brother ever but he doesn\u2019t hold any resentment towards him. He\u2019s too pure for this world.",
            "When does Dabi\u2019s voice actor not kill it? Dude is a goat",
            "Yeah the Endeavor fight by far has AFO's most diverse moveset in the story. It's a really good fight in the manga plus Bones loves Endeavor, they always put extra effort in his fights.",
            ">Very curious how much they are adapting next episode\n\nYeah, last week I was speculating that both this episode and the next one would cover 4 chapters each, as that would let the next episode end on AfO getting burned to a crisp (the end of the first section of that fight).\n\nBut nope, today's episode only did 3 chapters, so I can't imagine next episode covering the entirety of that fight now (5 chapters). Guess the next one will be 3 chapters as well, as to at least keep the final two chapters of the AfO fight together.\n\n***\n\nHmm, a continued rate of exactly 3 chapters per episode would mean this season ends on chapter 391, which would be a terrible place to end. 386 (I Am Here) has often been speculated as the season's end, but at this point that'd mean a lot of very slow episodes. 390 (end of Dabi fight pt. 2) could work, but would probably still require a good chunk more padding like last week's episode (some of the chapters ahead are pretty short too). Then there's the option of ending at chapter 395, end of the Toga fight, which I still think and hope is where it'll wrap up for now.\n\nAnd I'm still holding out hope the final few pages of chapter 386 gets moved to be the post-credits scene of the season finale. That'd be neat as a teaser for the All Might vs. AfO rematch.",
            "They\u2019ll probably cut half of the endeavor fight and fill most of the episode with emotional flashbacks",
            "Best animated? Even compared to Deku vs Overhaul? I mean I loved this fight but you said it yourself, the final move was kinda\u2026 underwhelming?",
            "It\u2019s intentional. Author\u2019s sometimes line up manga events to match the anime episode, hence Gege lining up the sealing of Gojo >!with his death.!< Hori himself has done this as well, Bakugo being killed by Mr. Smiley >!within the same week he gets turned into a donut.!<",
            "Eh... Peak animation is a very large stretch. Even the final \"big move\" was all a still frame. No impact shot no nothing. It all felt so flat. Sure the fire was pretty but everything else was a let down",
            ">Animation level was slightly above average honestly\u00a0\n\nYeah i thought Star and stripes vs Shigaraki looked better but i still thought this episode was good",
            ">Almost every fire move felt dull and different compared to the manga hell spider\n\nThat as been my main problem with shonen anime since the late Shippuden. Some aspect of the action and fights just feel so dull, mainly because they have to slow down the action to fit the 20min format, so everything drag, is unbearably toned down and lose all dynamism.\n\nBy comparaison look at certain anime fights like in DBZ where you could feel every blow, impact and shockwave to that of DBS. The scene where Dabi use hell spider or punch Shoto on the ground. Aren't those fire punch? Aren't we supposed to hear some form of deflagration sfx, roaring flames or whatnot?\n\nThe importance of effects in media where actions and fights take place is not to be understated, and I think some anime have been lacking in that department for a while. Fabulous dynamic actions pieces we often have in these manga is lost in translation to anime, and I doubt it's only a matter of production cost.\n\nOther than that the episode was beautifully directed and I absolutely loved the soundtracks. Anyone know the name of the one that is playing during the flashback at the 9min mark, and the one during Shoto's Flashfire Fist?\n\nEdit: Here, explained it plainly.",
            "I KNOWWW.\n\nUgh, he could've been a lot more sympathetic if he didn't kill innocent people. But then again, he IS very mentally unstable so, I guess that's their way of showing he just doesn't care what he does if it hurts his dad in some way. But I guess Horikoshi was never trying to make dabi fully sympathetic in the first place, so it works.",
            "Sunflowers are not just part of your garden, they\u2019re part of a nation! The Ukraine use the sunflower as their national flower. Whilst in Kansas they chose the sunflower to represent their state.",
            "Right? In the manga at the time, it was kind of muddled. But damn, Dabi was punching him like a man on the street, holy heck.",
            "Should have clarified. I was speaking about only this season.",
            "Hmm interesting info. Thanks",
            "Mr who ?",
            "Imagine trying to put down this episode",
            "I mean, at the end of the day\n\"Peak animation\" here is subjective. \nIt's a very large stretch for you.\nFor me, its a bit of stretch.\nFor them, its exactly how it is.",
            "Get out of here with that flat shit lol. It's easily a peak animation episode.",
            "Not really. DBZ had a lot of staring. TOP has almost 60 episodes of constant fighting. I think thats the longest in any anime where very episode has a fight.",
            "Ohhh my bad homie! Yeah it was definitely the best so far. Agreed there. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re saving the best for the Endeavor fight or the Deku Gearshift moment.",
            "That laughing dude in the OVA.\u00a0",
            "Yea? So what. I had high expectations and they weren't met",
            "Sure your expectations are very low and that's fine :)",
            "How can you watch this and say my expectations are low...some of you have insane expectations. We had some incredible talent on this episode.",
            "Because it was just a good standard episode? U act like my hero is incapable of crazy good animation? It's been shown time and time again they can do it if they want. Compare this moment to any of them pls. it IS NOT INSANE to have those expectations",
            "But that's the thing. The animation on this episode was pretty insane. It's okay that you did not like the way they did things, but the the animation itself was super strong.",
            "It was good but not mind-blowing. It was just consistent good animation but it never reached the epic scale it could have.",
            "I think you just did not like what they did. They went pretty all out for such an action packed season imo."

And so he can last some time without any immediate issues until the ambient hits him with that common cold left right goodnight\n\nI could easily be wrong, im not a doctor lol.",

Even more messed up is that kid is confirmed to be the doctor's grandson.",

The writing is SO GOOD, it's honestly beautiful, and Horikoshi's biggest achievement was introducing Mirio then almost immediately making him the most compelling character in the entire manga.\n\nThis is why for all its flaws, and they are very real, for all of its serious pacing issues, for all of the issues with MHA, I can't just say \"Oh yeah the writing isn't that good\" or \"It's just a generic battle shonen\".

Her motherly character, her devotion to duty, her design, her quirk.\n\nMasterful, just like Lemillions arc.\n\nBut I disagree that its bad he was written out for so long, infact I kinda thought him coming back almost ruined his character arc\n\nI think the overall story could have been much better had he actually died and have that be a more pivotal moment for Deku, kinda like Kite in HxH.",

As the story progressed, culminating in this fight, he easily became my favorite character.\n\n2. Watching these exact scenes, I thought to myself that what would be the absolute peak move would be for Deku to literally come exploding through the wall to save him.

I mean Mirko kinda too with how he literally just tore her body apart every time she was on screen/panel. \n\nI think the series had a legendary first half, then you could very quickly tell when Horokoshi was trying to wrap it up.

Mirio as well is a greatly utilized comparison to Deku but there just isn't enough there for me to attach to him like the other hero characters we do know. His power is cool, and I'm not gonna act like his moments aren't great, but he's very milquetoast compared to other side characters who are genuinely amazing. He definitely served his purpose in the plot as well so I never really got the idea that he was underutilized. We have a very hard time actually critiquing how Hori utilizes side characters because many let their own attachments to the characters take over and we don't realize that some characters come, serve their purpose, and sit in the background until another apt moment comes to utilize them. It comes with being a side character. Speaking of when those moments come, I actually think his return in the first war is a genuine low point for the series because of how interruptive it was and how it's right before Compress' biggest character moment in the series, somehow making that worse by association.\n\nI do like his stuff in the final war. Him getting an actual laugh out of ShigAFO in that sick spread of Deku arriving was so funny.",

There are far better moments in the series that capture the essence of what the series is all about.

Like, I didn't really expect him to do much after Paranormal Liberation Arc as he just returned and wouldn't have any reason to engage with Shigaraki there. Hell, I didn't expect to be as prevalent in first half of the final war when Miruko, Bakugo, Nejure, and Sun eater facing off against Shigaraki, yet he was the main one who was putting up a decent \"fight\" against Shigaraki besides Bakugo of course.",

I know Mirio didn't do much damage-wise, but at a time when Shiggy felt unstoppable, seeing someone not named Deku flat out get in the pocket with him throwing hands *while simultaneously shittalking to the point of giving him EMOTIONAL DAMAGE* was fucking based. Mirio didn't carry the damage but he certainly carried the stall. Everybody would have been dead on Deku's arrival if it weren't for Mirio.

It makes LeMillion look badass without it becoming sadistic.\n\nThe anime couldn\u2019t expand on that 5 minutes without looking sadistic and making the scene boring, so their only option was showing stills of the 5 minutes (which also looked boring), or skipping the stills which people would have even been more mad about.\n\nIt\u2019s just an issue with the different mediums.",

When did I wish ill on them?\n\n\"Hope this helps.\"\n\nWhy would you calling me weird then making it invalid to critcize art help? No, it doesn't help, it objectively - that word again! - harms discourse.",

I also wish we got to see more of Mirio taking care of Eri after the school festival arc.",
