        "content": "People have been telling me that their posts I've been removing actually shouldn't be removed because they are \"personalized\" and meet the \"off my chest\" criterion.  I'm going to explain this is greater detail with plenty of examples so what type of posts are allowed is more clear for everyone to understand.\n\nPersonalized in this case means that what you're posting has to be directly related to you (this would include a close person, such as a family member).  And it can't be something that's impacting a large number of people unless it has a specific application to you.\n\n**Examples of valid \"personal\" posts:**\n\n\"I just found out I owe a bunch of money on my taxes!\"\n\n\"My parents just found out they owe a bunch in back taxes and might go under!  I wish I could help them!\"\n\n\n**Examples of \"impersonal\" posts:**\n\n\"Taxation is theft!\"\n\n\"Don't you hate it when you have to pay taxes?\"\n\n\n**What is meant by being an \"off my chest\" style post?**\n\nAn off my chest style post is you getting something off your chest that's personal in nature (so, both related to you or someone you know quite personally and has a direct impact on you or them that isn't generalized) AND that is a story, situation, hope for the future, or some other type of direct situation.\n\n**Note:  Opinions, hot takes, asking generalized questions not tied to a valid post, political commentary, talking about things that have nothing to do with you SPECIFICALLY, generalizations, etc. do NOT count as off my chest style posts.**\n\n\n**Example of valid off my chest style posting:**\n\n\"I stubbed my toe and cried today.  I feel so humiliated.\"\n\n\"My friend is transitioning and it feels like they're becoming a different person, but I want to support them.  It just feels like I'm losing them.\"\n\n\"I lost my job due to [insert cancel culture thing here].\"\n\n\"My parents hit my kids and I don't want them to ever see or touch them again!\"\n\n\n**Examples of invalid off my chest style posts:**\n\n\"Stubbing toes is the worst thing ever.  Does anyone else agree?\"\n\n\"Transitioning fundamentally alters a person to the point where they aren't even themselves anymore.\"\n\n\"Cancel culture is bullshit!\"\n\n\"Children should not be hit!\"\n\n\"As an (insert group here), I feel that (insert opinion here).\"\n\n\"I like X TV show.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know how to fix a broken headlight?\" (we've gotten these before, lol)\n\n\"Not ALL men/women...\"\n\n\"[Insert any commentary on any hot-button topic here.]\"\n\n**Note:  You can give your opinion on a personalized situation, but your whole post can't just be the opinion, and it has to be something that's meaningfully specific.  But you cannot stand on a soapbox and preach it.**\n\n\nIn some cases, a post may be removed that can be reworded to \"fit\", but the majority of the time there isn't a way to reword a post to \"fit\".\n\nI am quite aware that this kills a large portion of what the sub used to allow, but after seeing the types of post that are now front-paging that simply weren't allowed to before due to all the flaming and getting the same hot takes over and over again, I honestly can't help but feel like this was a net positive.\n\nAlso, my removal of your post for not following the rules has nothing to do with whether or not I personally agree or disagree with the post.  I've removed something from every major category recently.  I'm also pretty good about explaining how posts don't fit the criteria if asked on any given specific.  This absolutely sucks for me.  I've removed over 500 posts in the last 4 days.  I hate this, but the benefit to the subreddit is substantial, so I'm going to keep this going as much as I can.\n\nAlso, if a post is up that violates these rules, 99/100 times it's because I'm sleeping.  I may also make a mistake or another mod might approve a post that was removed by the automod and not my manual flagging.",

But if I were to remove posts in *support* of that (even just to be fair), it would be because I'm \"transphobic\" in my moderation, and \"transphobia isn't a political issue\".\n\nOf course, both sides assert that their political statements aren't political in nature and if we allow generalizations and opinions in general, someone will obviously and clearly make a political one regardless.",

Censorship is when you take specific ideas and \"ban them\".  We aren't banning any given idea, ideology, or what have you.  Rather, we have created and are enforcing rules that *all* people have to follow.\n\nThe post saying, \"Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization\" is banned in the same way the post saying, \"Black lives matter shouldn't be a political statement!\" is.\n\n> I'm going to enjoy watching your sub burn to the ground.\n\nIf it wasn't on fire, we wouldn't have been proactive in putting out said fire.

It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...\n\n**Reddit Moderation!**\n\nWhat could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!\n\n`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`\n\nOn to more serious matters,\n\nWe are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.\n\nSo what does moderating actually entail?\n\n* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.\n* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.\n* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.\n* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.\n* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.\n\nIf you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.\n\n[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)\n\nThese apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",

Women have been conditioned to accept less than the bare minimum. It's definitely changing, but for a lot of women it's hard to risk being alone and giving up those fantasized securities. But also sometimes it's an inescapable feeling of being unworthy of more. I've been blessed with a wonderful partner but I had to tolerate a lot before we met but I told my fiance if we don't work out I'm never dating men again.

And there are a lot of men who are aware that a lot of women will tolerate below the bare minimum that they don't have to. It's a lot easier to hop on an app and find someone new than to actually be willing to do better. I think the \"male epidemic of loneliness\" reflects this, if this weren't generally the case it wouldn't be such a widespread issue reported by men and women who are single and childless wouldn't be the happiest demographic. I'd say a lot of data suggests it's an accepted common theme with men in heterosexual relationships therefore often difficult to avoid entirely.

You are filled with grief, fear, anger, pain beyond belief, dumbness, resignation and every other emotion causing you to be left feeling completely destroyed. I know this story. It was exactly my story too\u2014 give or take. \n\n20 years. Two kids. A great marriage. A partnership all our friends envied. Until it wasn\u2019t because he was falling in love with a coworker. \n\nThe only things I can tell you are these: as hard as some days are going to be you must go on. If only for your children\u2014 for now. You are going to spiral for a while and might develop Broken Heart Syndrome. Your chest will hurt and feel like there\u2019s a weight pressing on it. Your bones will ache and your veins will feel like they are filled with broken glass. You will not sleep or eat. You might feel suicidal. You also might think you can handle all of this and not need help but do not follow through with that. Follow the advice of your lawyer. Take the help offered from your doctor. Take medication if you feel it might help. Seek counselling. Understand that in a year how you are feeling right now will not how you will feel then. Time will help soften things. I promise that. \n\nThe main thing I need to advise tho, is that no matter how tempting it might be, you must refrain from ever bad mouthing your husband (or the mistress)to your kids. Don\u2019t fill them with the details or your anger and pain. They will see you struggling with it anyway. It will be painful enough for them. Explain to your children that your husband is unhappy in his life (but NOT with them) and that he needs to figure out how to be happy but in his own space. If they ask about divorce say you don\u2019t know yet. All that stuff doesn\u2019t matter right now. Just THEY matter but whatever happens they are staying in the same house (do not move) and everything will be ok. This might be a lie. Doesn\u2019t matter. Say it anyway to them. They need to feel safe and loved. Disparaging their father will cause nothing but pain to them. It will also backfire and make them loathe the part of you that was too weak to be silent for them. I know that part too because my own mother did the opposite in her divorce from my father and I hated her for it. Weaponizing children is a vile way to try and make your own pain less.

He was funny, kind, stood with both feed on the ground, we were successful together and then after 18 years together he cheated on me. And he even had the nerve to tell me, it was not what it seemed, although I read his messages to her, where he wrote her that he is completely in love with her. And that they spent the night together. I left him immediately. This had been 7 years ago and my desperation of the first 1 or 2 years turned into full blow disgust for him. Thank god, we didn\u2019t have children and weren\u2019t married, so that I was able to cut contact completely. But I remember the first years crying almost every night, and the question what I did wrong that it went this way. And why he decided to cheat instead of leaving me if he was unhappy. I always saw him as an honest person (Surprise: obviously he wasn\u2019t). The lies even after everything was on the table and there was proof from different people that told me, his own messages to her and to colleagues that were involved so that he told me he would go to a certain barbecue with these colleagues but in reality he went to her\u2026 these lies from him even AFTER our breakup \u201cthat it was nothing serious and they were just friends\u201d were the ones that broke me even more. I don\u2019t really have any good advice beside go to your friends and family. Never take him back. It was not an accident, it was his decision. Separate as soon as possible (either he or you move out) and try to find stability in new hobbies with other people (learn dancing or gardening or whatever) this will distract you, the hobby will bring you fun and you will get to know new people. Focus on your children and your job. And try to get through the next months as good as possible. There will be a lot of tears. Soooo sorry. Stay strong.

            "If this can help in any way, and I understand I\u2019m going against the grain. Sex for women is a serious commitment of vulnerability. You\u2019re letting a man enter you and you\u2019re submitting in the sense that you\u2019re trusting them with your body. It\u2019s generally a very intimate moment where, for most women, they need to legitimately like the guy if not have feelings for him. \n\nFor men, most of the time, it\u2019s genuinely no different than masturbation. It\u2019s basically living out porn (to put it into context). It\u2019s to essentially masturbate but with another woman in mind/involved. \n\nFor a woman to cheat, almost every time it means she\u2019s done with the relationship/it\u2019s over. For a man to cheat, if not caught, it rarely means it\u2019s over. And no matter what anyone says, monogamy is unnatural for men, but out of love for our partners, some of us cannot even consider cheating. \n\nFor women, one man, who can protect them and provide long term is the most evolutionarily advantageous. For men, having sex with as many women to increase odds of healthy off spring, is most evolutionarily advantageous. \n\nSo there\u2019s a major disconnect, we\u2019re literally opposites in this context, and cheating is the end of the world from both sex\u2019s perspective. Men, know what it means when it a woman cheats, and women, project what it would mean for them to cheat into men, and what sex means for them, not realizing, in reality, odds are, the guy was pretty much doing emotionally the equivalent of jerking off. Most of us know the damage, however, so sex with another woman is not an option. \n\nI say this, not to try and absolve him of his sin, but if it may lighten the emotional blow even a smidge, it was worth noting. The pain associated with cheating isn\u2019t usually just the physical act, but what the physical act means. And to be honest, odds are, for him, it really meant nothing, particularly in face of what your relationship meant to him. He made a major mistake, and he likely didn\u2019t grasp the gravity of it all given what the sex likely meant/didn\u2019t mean to him.",

In hindsight, do you think there was anything missing for him, whether it be love, sex, or communication?\n\nI'm asking to try to understand what exactly he found in her that he didn't find in you.\n\nI'm not suggesting that this is your fault at all, and I understand that if he cheated, the responsibility lies with him. I'm prepared to be misunderstood, but I really want to understand what drove him to cheat.\n\nMany women describe their partners as perfect and caring, apart from the cheating. This suggests that things might not have been perfect for him. Sometimes, we don't realize something is missing for our partner because we feel fulfilled ourselves.\n\nMy heart goes out to you, and I am truly sorry for what you're going through.",

Do you ever just greet him with head and a warm meal with no expectation of reciprocation because he\u2019s the love of your life?\nChances are he loves you, your kids, your businesses, and the life you\u2019ve built together more than life itself. \nI\u2019d bet the other woman is just a pressure release valve and/or he was caught up in chase and feeling attractive/pursued again.

Who we love and who we like fucking can be different things, and while who we love (that\u2019s you) will always be that one person, who we enjoy fucking is interchangeable, and not very different then  jerking off.\n\nMaybe before you throw away your whole life, try broadening your horizons.

That\u2019s with you.\n\nHaving that urge doesn\u2019t mean we have to do it, but it means a part of us will always want to, and that doesn\u2019t make us bad people.

You only value your wife enough to stay loyal to her and not hurt her if you have a good sex life? That poor woman if you told her what you're telling OP now I feel bad for her that she's with someone who would try to break down her self esteem. Instead of taking accountability you put the blame on her to make her think your fuck up was somehow partially her fault. \n\nI don't even think all cheaters are the devil. Some people just make really bad decisions however how you handle your bad decisions is what determines your character. If all you do is try to shift blame instead of admitting you were completely wrong you're kinda shitty.\n\nHis reasons don't matter, that's the big thing y'all don't get. The actions suck regardless. Even if it's loveless or whatever y'all know that you're going to hurt your partner you just don't care. That's why it sucks and I'm sure you understand that. You know what you're doing whether it's for love or for just sex is going to emotionally wreck the person you claim to love and you don't care enough to not do it. So maybe OPs husband isn't some evil person that intentionally set out to crush her heart but he does lack care for her feelings or care enough about this life they built because he knew the end result and did it anyway. \n\nThis method of trying to scare your partner into staying with you by telling them their life is gonna suck is so gross. Your putting responsibility for your bad actions on them instead of just owning up. There is no agency for OP to take it was his decision just like cheating on your wife was your decision. As much as I'm sure you love to think she drove you to do what you did it was all you. \n\nY'all think being without you is oh so miserable when really it's great because you've cut a toxic thing out of your life. How do you even know OP wants another husband? Hate to break it to you but you're not a prize and not every man is as selfish and red pilled as you are. You know there are single dads and also men that are capable of caring for kids that aren't theirs just. \n\n\nBut all of that is redundant because the kids don't need another dad. They already have one unless you think he's gonna fuck off after the divorce because if he does he wasn't worthy to be a dad in the first place. Maybe OP will find someone else, maybe she won't but at the end of the day it doesn't matter because having a significant other doesn't make or break a persons happiness unless they take advice like this and stake the entirety of their self worth on it.",

I don't understand why you would rather break someone's heart than just use your hand or a toy.  Sex drives go down if you can't handle that without stepping out of your marriage you're just weak whether you're a man or a woman. Act like you give a shit about them and communicate to try to find a solution. Is your marriage really so weak that a sex drive going down is enough to crumble it? Of course I'm not naive enough to think sex is a nonfactor in relationships but for the love of God it's not everything. It sounds like you only value your partner based on how much they do for you sexually, it's odd.\n\n2. I'm not sure what the point of this metaphor was as  it doesn't really relate to anything we've talked about but decisions like that require two yes's if one person doesn't want to do that those ppl aren't compatible and shouldn't be together. That doesn't necessarily make the other a bad person though it just means they want different things.

Guy missing one or two things and woman who won\u2019t budge and asks him to give up what drives him to his very core.\nNo wonder vast majority of divorces initiated by women.\nAnd second point is absolutely valid.

            "LMAO you communicated after damage was already done and yes it's ok for anyone not sleep with someone for whatever reason. That's how consent works. You can't be selfish for not giving something to someone a person is not entitled to especially when ' that 'something' is a persons literal body.  But hey if it's selfish to respect myself by not having sex purely for someone else's benefit I'll be that and proudly too. Your view on sex is kinda weird to be honest I mean really \"drives you to your core\" that's batshit. \n\nYou don't just have sex with ppl to make them happy you do it because you both want too and whatever reason comes after that. There are plenty of reasons a sex drive would decrease the answer to solving that isn't cheating. Which is my whole point, like I said sex is important but if you weaponize a lack of it to justify your bad decisions yeah my response to you is tough shit. Be a grown up and talk it out instead of ruining your marriage. If you think sex is one of the most important thing in a relationship then I don't even know what to tell you. That's just really sad to me. Like I thought you're just another cheater that can't take accountability. \n\nYour view on divorce is also just wild. Just because someone initiates the divorce doesn't mean its their fault. If one partner hits the other and the hit partner files for divorce is that divorce on them? What about if they lie or steal constantly? This whole \"you initiated so you're at fault is stupid and you know it. Not every divorce is terrible and if you don't want to be divorced just treat your partner with respect. Also being divorced doesn't automatically mean the dad disappears he's still their dad. Just because he's no longer married to their mom doesn't make him not their dad. So what the hell are you talking about, a good dad finds ways to still be involved with their kids after a divorce. If he can't then he probably wasn't that good a dad to begin with. You should never keep an unhealthy relationship going just for the sake of the kids it's no better than a bad divorce. \n\nAnd as for your bs scenario sex decreasing is not as big a deal as rearranging and uprooting your entire life. If you think it is I urge you to touch grass or something to bring yourself back to reality. The problem isn't that things change it's the severity of said change. There are ways to get around a decrease in sex depending on what's causing it there aren't any ways to get around having a completely different view on how to live your life. \n\nNow while I enjoy pointing out the flaws in all your logic, or lack there of, I think I've made my point. Probably not to you cause you live in delulu land but to any cheated on person that so happens to find your comments and in a moment of weakness actually starts believing this crap.",
            "If you keep reading some people have suggested that she waits before she pulls the plug. It\u2019s a tough and personal decision to make. I wish you the best.",
            "Ok well it\u2019s great to talk it out with your partner as I did but ultimately talk isn\u2019t going to do it. So are you going to dig deep and f$&@ your hubby or go down on him even when you\u2019re not in the mood or not? \nAs I said from outset you don\u2019t understand or seek to understand the importance of sex to men. You can call it sad or whatever but so is your need to be with a high status man who is a great provider. We don\u2019t give a shit about you being those things but if I quit my job and want to live off the land like a pauper are you ok with me saying \u201ctough shit\u201d when you complain about having to toil in the dirt? If you love me, you should be happy whether I have a job or status or not. Is that fair?\n\nAnd yes, you can pick extreme examples of domestic abuse if you like but the vast majority of divorces end for far more trivial reasons (I wasn\u2019t happy\u2026boohoo) and were majority initiated by women.\n\nThe state of our divorce rates, broken homes, broken culture should tell you we have a problem and maybe your \u201cfuck him just leave regardless of kids/life built\u201d attitude is not helping."

        "content": "Today after my roomates and I had just gotten back from getting some food in town there was a knock on our door. The older woman on the other side said that she had seen us come in from our car and was wondering if we could help her. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a damsel in distress, I need help moving a couch, I just can\u2019t move it.\u201d \n\nAt first my roommate started saying that both he and I had to work soon and we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have the time. The woman pleaded with us and offered to pay us. Why not. On the way over she mentioned that the couch was \u201creally gross.\u201d But nothing more.\n\nWe follow her into the apartment and we\u2019re met with a couch that has dark blood stained all over one end. You could see where it had dripped down on the sides, splattered at the top. There was a pillow sitting there drenched in blood and mucus matter. We were taken aback. The woman added quietly that her son had died recently within this past week. I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near the biohazard, and the smell was awfully indescribable. \n\nMy roommate, M and I stuck around and helped her move the couch outside so it could be loaded into her husband\u2019s truck and thrown out. \n\nThe woman gave us each $20 and looked deep past my eyes and into my soul when she said \u201cGod bless you.\u201d I noticed even more blood on the floor of the living room, you could see that the couch had been sitting right there, as there was a straight edge to one side of the puddles. \n\nWe left and I felt so upset afterwards I went into work early and explained it all to my manager and then went back home. I felt shaken up inside and out, my hands were shaking, I would tear up thinking about it, sometimes just sobbing uncontrollably. \n\nI felt upset by all of this, but I can\u2019t imagine how the two of them feel. If they had anyone else they wouldn\u2019t have pleaded with some random kids to help them with this.",

            "We found out that the man had passed about a week or two ago. This morning there were ambulances and cop cars out front that none of us had seen. We weren\u2019t aware of this until it was in front of us.\n\nAbout a week ago around 3 or 4 AM when I was up late drinking I heard a loud bang or a pop that I thought had sounded like a gunshot. I was drunk though, so I sat and listened for anything else. No dogs barking, no one moving, thought I was imagining it. Now I\u2019m wondering if i had heard that man take his life. \n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly how he died, it\u2019s obvious he had taken his own life, and we all assumed it must\u2019ve been a gunshot because of the amount of mucusy matter was around. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen anything this horrific in my life, I\u2019ve never even seen a body at a funeral.",

In general, the average human being isn\u2019t meant to see death like that, and you should not feel any pressure to \u201cget over\u201d your experience. Take your time. What you saw and heard counts as a trauma, and should not be taken lightly. Trauma affects everyone differently, so it\u2019s okay to seek out counseling, even if you feel like your experience wasn\u2019t \u201cthat traumatic\u201d compared to what other people have gone through.\n\nTake care :)",

There was so.... so much. It was honestly the most traumatic part of his dying and I can't imagine how much worse it would be if it was my kid's life blood I was trying to clean. \n\nYou did good, honey. You did real good. For what it's worth I'm proud of you.",

I helped her and her other sister boyfriend clean up what was left of him. The fluids were everywhere and so were the maggots and flies. I will remember that for the rest of my life.

She goes through the worst thing can happen to a parent. I\u2019m sure she knew you absolutely wouldn\u2019t help if you\u2019d knew beforehand, needed help desperately and on top wasn\u2019t able to get the words out.

Plus, maybe the different generation on top, like men don\u2019t really have problems with this. Or that\u2019s what told herself.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you had to encounter.

It\u2019s just a thought because I know a lot of elderly people already feel guilty for asking for help with little simple things just because they feel like \u201cburden\u201d in this busy world.

            "OP, I don't know 6 this is helpful at all, but I get it. \n\nMy step-dad took his life in 2020. To his credit, he tried to make it as untraumatic as possible for us, particularly my mom (my sis and I did not live at home). He shot himself while he was inside one of those cargo containers people strap to their cars, think Thule brand stuff. He had it in the garage. It honestly did what he wanted it to - it contained all the blood and other matter, and other than my mom lifting it open (knowing what she would find, based in where it was), she didn't see everything (though she saw more than she ever needed to). \n\nHowever. His plan didn't take into account what happened when the coroner would remove him from the container. When I got the call about what had happened, and even the 20 minute drive there, they hadn't moved him yet. It was an hour or two later, and the victim's advocate was super useless, but something got mentioned about cleanup (they took the cargo container). My sister and I looked at each other, and then told mom we'd get the things out of the garage he had gathered around him.  There were blood stains, from when they had to pull him out, and then a blood trail, drops, from there to the sidewalk where the coroner parked. My sister lived a few houses down the street, so she gathered my mom and took her to her house. My BIL and I spent the next hour+ doing everything we could to clean up every last blood stain - put on the driveway, in the dark, cell phone flashlights blazing, scrubbing with Dawn and then bleach and then any cleaner we could find. \n\nIn the end, we just didn't want my mom to see any blood. We didn't want her to deal with that on top of everything else. It sucked, I didn't cry during it but for weeks afterwards I would close my eyes and only see bloodstain I needed to clean up. It eventually faded away, and I would do it again in an instant to save someone from having to deal with it. \n\nI'm sorry she sort of \"tricked\" you, but please know you helped her more than she could ever tell you. And please check in on her. \ud83d\udc99",

My neighbor owned a few rentals and had a death occur in one on a lazy boy. He said the chair was cleaned but he left it on the road and the next day someone took it. Messed him up a bit.

I tried conventional therapy and it helped me get some perspective, but didn't help with the images in my mind and feeling horrible about it. The EMDR and hypnotherapy took just 2sessions.",

When you look back when you didn't help and your aware it can haunt you in a different way if you helped, and theres something about positive action that helps ypu resolve the trauma.

The part that kept me going, is that this was a way that I could help people, so that I can take the brunt of it, not them, and yes, they know what happened, but at least the next time they see it, its not pools of blood and brain matter everywhere, its clean, smell is gone, everything disposed of properly even if they need to get new flooring, walls, ceiling or what not, at least they're not spending hours seeing the horror of what's taken place.",

And even if when these behaviors are slight they still affect your job/education, your friendships, and your own view of yourself.",

            "I used to have a maid service and we referred biohazard cleanup and bedbugs to two other places that specialized in it, and there was a gunshot suicide they quoted like 65k for. That's where that number came from- that was Austin, Texas about 8 years ago and that crew did a lot of work for the city after murders and such. I didn't know if that was a particularly grizzly cleanup but that was the number I passed on to the customer. \n\nAnd yeah, a funeral can absolutely wipe a family that's living paycheck to paycheck out. It's really sad. :( One of those things where I wish basic cremation was covered for all taxpayers because damn, it's salt in the wound when a poor family loses the breadwinner in an accident and then they have to scrape up funeral costs on top of everything else, it just seems so needlessly cruel. I'd rather my tax dollars go to that than a lot of other things to be honest.",

When someone is found dead, it\u2019s absolutely standard practice to have both police and medical personnel. So the man took his life a week ago, someone probably called the cops today to do a wellness check on him, and they found his body on the couch. The police and medical personnel responded to the emergency but they don\u2019t have to clean up afterwards. The man\u2019s parents (the elderly couple in this story) were the ones who were left to figure out how to clean up the mess in the apartment. They likely don\u2019t have enough money to hire a professional biohazard cleaning crew since they now need to pay for a funeral. So they had to resort to asking the neighbors (OP and his roommates) for help. The elderly folks didn\u2019t need the ambulance. Their son\u2019s dead body did.",

Tetris has been proven to help when played after a traumatic event. \n\nOP, there are free websites that allow you to play right there on your phone too. \n\nAnd if need be, EMDR is good for this kind of stuff too. It helps you process trauma and makes things easier. Just because you are alright now it doesn\u2019t mean intrusive thoughts won\u2019t pop up later on.

I thought when you said he'd died over a week or so ago, I thought he'd been found dead and body removed over a week ago, but parents were just sorting out clearing the sofa today. So I was thinking there'd be no need for several cops and ambulance etc so was worried something could have happened to the parents from the shock. But my mistake, I realise although he died over a week or so ago, he was only discovered today hence the police and ambulance coming to remove the body etc. \n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through that. Those parents will never forget your help and generosity in such a difficult time. It's awful for you guys to have had to see and deal with that, let alone the parents. Can't imagine. I do hope you get some support for what you went through, and as others have suggested, you and your mates should play tetris after a trauma like that as its meant to help reduce the effects of ptsd and trauma memory etc. And if you continue to struggle, don't be afraid to seek some counselling. \n\nYou did a very generous deed, in such awful circumstances, but those parents will be forever grateful.",
            "Ooooh OK, I was miss reading things. I thought when he said the son died a week or 2 ago, I thought police had removed the body then, but it's only now the parents were sorting out removing the sofa etc. And then the next day op sees police and ambulance there. So I was thinking if the body had been removed over a week ago, there'd be no need for ambulance and multiple police, but I get what you're saying now. He was only discovered yesterday or today, and that's why police and ambulance were there to recover the body. \n\nAppreciate you clearing it up for me. I got confused with when each thing happened etc. So was concerned something could have happened to the parents after going through that trauma etc. Its bad enough of a trauma for OP to go through seeing the gruesome sofa, and blood stains etc. But for the parents thats horrific. No parent should have to clean up their child's suicide and blood. I think in situations like this it's a shame the council don't have a cleaning service (free of charge) to clean crime scenes like this. Or at least a low nominal fee contribution, because not many families would be able to pay such an expense, but it's a huge trauma to clean up something like that. So awful for everyone involved.",
            "Couldn't care less",
            "Depends on the conditions. Sometimes it is hazard specialists (usually working with or contracted by the police). Around me, everything besides the body is the family's responsibility. There are \"crime scene/unattended death\" specialists that you can pay to have clean/remove the area affected professionally. After my dad's suicide my sister and I did it so that my mom didnt have to. Since it is a biohazard it isn't cheap to pay for the services. We did it though as we wanted to be respectful of his things to try to preserve what we could for our mom.",

I saw it on Reddit a few years ago and after witnessing a homicide the day after my brother was killed, I remembered it and gave it a try, if only to have something else to focus on. Normally trauma shuts me down and keeps me from leaving the bed, and I can't really discuss it or ask for help for months or years. Not gonna lie, it's been hard as hell still and I do have PTSD, but considering the magnitude of what happened this time compared to how strongly I responded to the other things I've been through without playing Tetris, I'm seeing improvement pretty damn quickly. I feel like I developed fewer triggers from it as well. I'm honestly grateful for everyone who posted about it because I don't think I would have managed to survive if I hadn't had that immediate help.",
