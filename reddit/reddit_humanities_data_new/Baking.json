She told me the theme was lemon and let me know what colors she wanted, but beyond that told me I could do whatever I liked. I recommended she hire a local bakery near us for the job, but she was very excited and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so I hesitantly agreed. The party is tomorrow and I made the cookies in the first picture two days ago so the icing would have plenty of time to set, but it\u2019s been nearly 100 degrees and humid every day this week and we live in an old house with bad air circulation. I used the same icing recipe I always do (normal results in the second photo) but either I royally (\ud83d\ude2d) fucked up or the temperature is ruining the texture. Either way, please send help. She\u2019s coming to pick up tomorrow and I spent several days making, baking, and decorating 5 dozen cookies for her that look like this and I\u2019m so embarrassed \ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t think I have time to scrape and redo them all at my crappy amateur decorating level, but if I pulled an all nighter and gave it a hail mary would they set? Or if heat/humidity are the problem would that be even worse? For reference, my partner did a test for quality control and said they\u2019re very yummy, but I am still freaked out. Any advice appreciated. \n",

It was either from over beating the icing or my apt being too humid. The oven trick was taught to me by the cookie elders.",

If there\u2019s anything I think would be helpful, I\u2019ll report back. \n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself! They look good despite their irregularities and most importantly taste good.",

            "Don't be too hard on yourself - they look pretty and you set expectations accordingly with your friend. If they really aren't drying, your problem is probably that the icing itself is overmixed. If you push a finger onto it, does it feel spongy? That, plus the slightly pitted look, are usually signs of overmixing. If you scrape and re-do, I would try it with a fresh batch of icing. (As somebody who does a lot of decorated sugar cookies and has had my fair share of last minute oopsies, I'm sending hugs your way!!)",

The comment said that: \"Typically people buy these to make jerky or dried fruits at home, but I read this tip on a cookie blog and I love my dehydrator! Not only does it keep the cookies crisp and fresh, but it also helps your icing dry faster and more evenly.\"\n\nIt may not fix the icing but it sounds like it may help to keep the humidity from affecting the cookies. Hope this helps a bit!",
            "I think they look fine. You were very forward about your comfort level for this project and think you did everything in good faith to deliver. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.",
            "My first reaction was; Oh how cute!!!!! I want those now!!!",
            "I would be over the moon to receive these. \n\nMy mom bakes sugar cookies around holidays, but mainly during the cooler part of the year because the humidity here DEFINITELY messes with them. If I were you, I wouldnt scrap the work youve done, especially if it will take you not sleeping to be able to redo them. \n\nThey are super cute and have a homemade charm about them. Be proud of your work!",
            "This will sound hokey, but if I saw these and heard that they'd been made by a family friend, I would find the slight imperfections endearing. They're genuinely beautiful, and clearly a lot of skill went into them. But even pros get a hiccup now and then. They still look mouth-watering! And knowing they were made with love only makes them more delicious, truly.",
            "If a family friend made these for my shower I\u2019d eat them all. And be so appreciative. I\u2019d eat anything my friends made for my shower, but these look delicious.",
            "Humidity is definitely working against you. Three options.\n\nFirst: prep icings into bags. Allow to chill before, and immediately after. Keep chilled until service if possible.\n\nSecond: remove humidity in your work place. Homemade swamp cooler with a paint bucket, a fan, and dry ice. \n\nThird: say fuck it. Try to ice on fly after it's chilled to a point. I've got about a decade of experience, and I even find this one hard.",
            "It\u2019s always easier to be critical of your own work. I personally think these are beautiful and look delicious! \ud83d\ude0bAs a close friend, I\u2019d be blown away and so grateful for your hard work!",
            "Are there other decorative elements you could add to the ones that you think need the most work, like edible glitter or pearl sprinkles? Candied lemon peel! Candied lemon slices (ultra-thin) would cover the top of one of these wonderfully. White chocolate drizzle.",
            "What? I absolutely love them!! Leave them alone and go get some rest \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf4b",
            "I honestly think they look great. Perfect? no. But seriously, they look really good. I get it though; it\u2019s easy to get in your head about it and start spiraling. BUT if these cookies were made for my party, I\u2019d absolutely love them and I\u2019d appreciate it \ud83e\ude75 Make peace with yourself (and the cookies \ud83d\ude02), and get a good night\u2019s rest for the party! xoxo",
            "The first couple of batches I did had that same texture. My mistake was to continue adding water to try to thin the icing out but then using my mixer to incorporate. I finally figured out I had to mix by hand with a spatula to get the proper consistency \n\nTo be clear, use a mixer to do the initial mixing, but then when you\u2019re ready to thin to flooding consistency, use a spatula",
            "Honestly, your pics made me happy - like a little bit of sunshine to brighten anyone's mood. So pretty.\n\nI'm not a baker, but I am a chocolatier, and if you want to talk about having temperature issues look no further than me making my own chocolates and displays for my wedding in July. I had to block off the 2 doors into the dining room area in our old house with mattresses and had two A/C units running full blast just so the chocolate would set.",
            "They both look amazing! I live in Arizona and I would buy the second set in a heartbeat. Don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect! That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong today, everything has to be Martha Stewart! Remember, I\u2019m sure she is amazing, but she also has a staff. The lemon ones with afternoon tea absolutely",
            "They look cute, but I can understand why you're not happy with them, because they aren't up to your normal standards.  If you aren't able to fix them or redo them, don't beat yourself up over it, things happen.\n\nJust be transparent, contact the customer (friend) and let them know what happened.  Provide pictures and ask them how they want to proceed, they may choose to cancel the order, ask for a discount or just be happy with what they get.\n\nMake sure you let them know that you're ok with whatever option they choose, you may lose out on time and money, but you've gained experience and that's how businesses work.\n\nBTW the second photo looks amazing and I know you can get right back into making them properly again, don't let this negatively affect your confidence!",
            "This happened to me once! While working at a bakery with years of experience under my belt \ud83d\ude05 The royal icing is over mixed! If you whip too much air into your royal icing, it\u2019ll never set/dry. I ended up having to scrape the icing off all the cookies and redo them with a fresh batch of icing. I had to redo the cookies because I worked at a bakery and the customer was paying a lot of money and expected the cookies to be individually wrapped in cellophane bags so they definitely needed to be dry. I definitely think you shouldn\u2019t beat yourself up about it. They still look super cute and taste yummy! I\u2019m sure all the guests will enjoy them \ud83d\ude0a",
            "They look good. Everyone knows it's hot, they shouldn't expect a miracle. Also, may I suggest that you work on saying \"no\" and sticking to it?",
            "Compared to my efforts those are amazing",
            "I genuinely don\u2019t see an issue here. I love the way they look! I think they turned out great, op!",
            "I'm an amateur, too, so I can't advise much around bakery,  but try not to feel embarrassed.  It is understandable,  and I can see where you are coming from. A good sign you can notice that it could be better, yet you did what you could with your current skill and situation. Your friend took a risk hiring you. If she wanted perfection, you hire a professional, not someone who never even dared to sell products.  I don't think you were scamming her or anything.  They are cute enough and taste good, and your partner is still alive, so you are doing well in what matters the most, so cheer up!",
            "I honestly think they look amazing.   I watch a lot of cookie TikTok\u2019s and I know I couldn\u2019t do this.   I\u2019d be happy with them as is. I had to zoom in to even kind of see what you are upset about.   They are great.   Don\u2019t stress.   And if they taste good, even better!!",
            "I\u2019m not a baker, but I had to read few comments and then zoom in again to understand what\u2019s going on and why you need help, cause these cookies look so good and I want to have some now!",
            "they're so pretty!",
            "I think they look super cute! You did a great job!",
            "My impression when I saw them was those look nice bet they taste good.",
            "These are pretty cute though",
            "Nah you good",
            "Looks great!!! If they are sticky could you put them in the fridge?",
            "I think the cookies look good. I was thinking they look very cute for a non professional baker",
            "Serve them! They still look really cute!",
            "Well they are absolutely beautiful to me",
            "I think these are awesome! Sure there's room for improvement but these look fab.",
            "These look delicious!! The icing texture is fire",
            "OP, I just had this happen to me a few days ago and did some colored sugar \u201caccents\u201d to hide some of the more egregious parts. They looked a little better, no one complained so I guess I got away with it???",
            "I\u2019d be happy if these were my bridal shower cookies, super cute:)",
            "Omg these look delicious! I love how light and airy your icing looks! And it\u2019s so white! Are you okay with sharing the recipe or the basic recipe to get it like that? Mine is never fluffy or thick looking (I rarely bake but when I make Christmas\u2019s cookies the icing isn\u2019t very pretty). Thanks! I bet everyone will love them tomorrow!! You did amazing!",
            "They really are beautiful cookies - hope she appreciates them!",
            "Looked at the pictures and didn\u2019t realise the \u201cproblem\u201d till I read the text.",
            "i would eat all of those they look so good!",
            "They look so cute and the most important factor is taste\u2026 don\u2019t be so hard on yourself!",
            "How do they taste?",
            "I love these! I soon as I saw the picture I wanted to know if I could buy some. There is nothing wrong with them.",
            "I'm so sorry this happened! Your cookies are beautiful, and you went above and beyond for your family. Don't beat yourself up. Severe humidity is rough!\n\nI promise you the cookies still look 1000 times better than my hair in humid weather. \ud83d\ude2b",
            "It's all about presentation. Set them out on the fanciest trays you have maybe crystal. Try to make them look like you sell them in bakeries. They look good to me.",
            "Honestly, I thought it was intentional and a total vibe at first. Something about the aesthetic of the middle lemon cookie really ties it all together and they\u2019re pretty consistently the same texture. Feels fun and summery and almost a bit beachy.",
            "The second plate is GORGEOUS! Such beautiful colors!",
            "im obsessed with your teal and orange ones, i hope you got this OP!",
            "Hey you are actively trying. Practice makes perfect. They are cute thanks for sharing!",
            "These look amazing! What is wrong?",
            "Hi! The secret is to dry the cookies in a dehydrator or oven. Dry them in the oven at 40-50 degrees Celsius for 4-6 hours depending on the size. \ud83d\ude42",
            "I'm late to the party but I really hope the oven has dried them out and you're feeling less stressed! I think they'll look brilliant on some fancy plates and the little inconsistencies in texture won't notice once they're all laid out and ready to be eaten! (Sometimes the smoothest, best looking iced cookies are rock hard and horrible to eat, so you could say you've deliberately made them softer for reasons of taste.)",
            "I think they look great!  I knew the theme before I read your post so I don\u2019t think they are as bad as you think. I don\u2019t think they are bad at all. I hope the oven thing works for you but if not I would be happy to have these at a party.",
            "I know it\u2019s not much help, but the right people will come along. It takes time to find and then develop true friendships. The cookies are beautiful.",
            "I'd still eat those cookies OP. The artistry is great, once you get the icing down they are gonna look awsome.",
            "First, they look fine. Just call them whimsical. Second, cookie storage. One assumes you could not fit them in your fridge, correct?  A cheap ice chest and some ice and ziplock bags, layering them between wax paper would work.  Just a thought though probably too late now. Good luck. You\u2019re definitely a good person no matter the outcome.",
            "So creative and pretty! I love them! \ud83c\udf4b",
            "Thank you! I have tackled this setup and am hoping for the best \ud83e\udd79 I very well could have over whipped, in which case, c\u2019est la vie \ud83e\udd72, but I\u2019m still attempting the oven solution and so far it seems to have helped some! Will let it keep going and see what happens, but I never would have thought to add heat to the hot-house equation to help fix the situation. Thank you for passing on knowledge from the cookie elders, you forever have my gratitude \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Make sure to prop your oven door open. Cookies still need airflow to dry.",
            "Cookie elders!!!!! I would like to have a dinner party and invite the cookie elders. Maybe by the time the dessert course rolls around, I will have asked them to demonstrate their knowledge and have a warm delicious cookie from the cookie elders. Gosh, Iove this phrase!!!!!",
            "OP i would try this and if they still turn out the same, just explain to them that the weather wasn\u2019t in your favor. im sure they\u2019ll understand, especially since they taste delicious!",
            "Would a convection oven on low heat be good for this?",
            "Thank you \ud83e\udd79 I have been moved to tears by all of the kind words and helpful advice on this post. I appreciate your (and everyone\u2019s) willingness to help a stranger!",
            "I'll be right over!!",
            "Right?? I\u2019m a little tipsy, but my first thought was that those cookies look dope and I would eat the hell out of them.",
            "Came here to say something like this. I think they look great.",
            "Right?! They are so pretty, I particularly love the color play. I'm jealous because I could NEVER",
            "I\u2019m a casual baker and agree. I\u2019d still make a comment about not wanting to eat them because they look too pretty- even in humidity!\n\nBest of luck, but I bet they\u2019ll be a hit.",
            "Yeah I see no problem. I only see deliciousness.",
            "I did the same exact thing! OP, these look great. :)",
            "Me too!!",
            "Right?!",
            "I was thinking the same. Shimmer powder or edible glitter can go a long way in covering mistakes. It will reflect the light and make things appear a little smoother, even if they\u2019re not.",
            "That comment may have been meant to be kind, but if I were OP that would just make me feel worse. May I suggest you not give unsolicited advice to someone who is clearly already upset about a situation?",
            "You do not want to put cookies with royal icing on in the fridge!!! It has the opposite effect.. it keeps them from drying out because of the lack of air and draws in moisture from fridge.. double bad times!",
            "I'm pulling for you op! Please let us know how it goes! They look absolutely beautiful to me",
            "They look beautiful to me too.   Good luck!   I once threw some edible flowers on top of my mistakes.   Everyone goes through challenges.",
            "You\u2019ve got skill though. Once you get the icing issue figured out they\u2019ll look phenomenal. Keep it up!",
            "How did they turn out after the oven? I honestly think they look great. I would be ecstatic if my friend did this act of love for me. Hope you and your friend are happy with the results!",
            "You\u2019re welcome. Oh that\u2019s wonderful to hear. Joyful, moved tears are amazing. \n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for B! Your username is delightful btw.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://littleviews-crafts.com/high-humidity-issues/) is (seemingly to me) a solid resource about humidity issues & troubleshooting them. \n\nI\u2019d say, try to let some nervous or self critical thoughts flow away like morning fog.",
            "Honestly when I saw the post I was like what do you need help with, eating them? lol",
            "It's delightfully different for a change!",
            "Same. Like I see the difference between them and some picture perfect lined cookie buuut these are better. I like the lemon in the middle most, but all the color smudged ones are amazing as well. Id be STOKED to receive these. Well done OP. -Cookie Elder (cuz I loved the term \ud83d\ude02)",
            "Giving unsolicited advice on a post where OP is asking for advice?? \n\n> Any advice appreciated.",
            "Oh! That\u2019s why I suggested ziplock bags to seal them. I am sorry if that is a bad idea.",
            "this is so wholesome\n\nedit to add: OP the cookies look great!",
            "This is some wholesome shit right here. We need more glitter bloods in the world.",
            "I took that to mean just baking/cookie advice \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "It's ok.. just 100% the wrong thing to do with sugar cookies. So I thought I should comment, in case someone took your advice! They can't be sealed before they're dry either, they need air to dry. Shoving them in a warm oven or a dehydrator works wonders,  but never store them in the fridge. (I wouldn't even put them in completely wrapped if they were dry already, as condensation tends to get in the bag). Unused royal icing (still wet and in a piping bag/sealed tub) can be stored in the fridge, but as soon as it's on a cookie it needs to be air dried, when dry you need an airtight ambient container. \n\nI do a lot of cookies.",
