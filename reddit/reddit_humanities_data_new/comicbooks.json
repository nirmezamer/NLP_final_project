It also serves as a way to consolidate discussion to a single thread and talk about what books are popular here on /r/comicbooks. That does not mean other threads aren't welcome, this is just a place to start that's easy to find each week.\n\nThe thread is populated with comments meant to direct the discussion of each book. Based on a recent community decision we're expanding the Top Ten and populated the thread with titles appearing on Ten Percent or more of submitted pull lists. If a title you want to talk about is not listed, simply add a comment with the title and issue number first and comment below. There is also a comment dedicated to the discussion of WPL results linked above.\n\n**Spoilers will follow**, but there's no harm in tagging them as such.  Each title in the Top Ten listed below is linked directly to its corresponding comments to avoid seeing details from other books.

            "Wow, **Spawn** makes the discussion thread in the first time in...forever?! Guess I *have* to comment :)\n\nSpawn, now powerless, injured and on the run, flees from the vampire  empire, accompanied by a new potential ally. \n\nLook, on the writing front - it's the same as always. Neither McConville or McFarlane are good writers. There are interesting big picture moves going on, but the way in which it's conveyed and structured is...poor. And the book (as always) is desperately in need of an editor. The writing, especially the ever present \"narration\" that swamps the story, is clunky and heavy handed.\n\nNow the good stuff. *Brett Booth's* move from the thoroughly enjoyable **Gunslinger Spawn** was a great loss, but his arrival on the main, core Spawn book is an absolute boon. He continues to bring an \"*over-the-top*\" 90's look and feel to the book that, frankly, fits the character like a glove. Some of the splash pages and double page spreads are incredible (*if* you're a fan of the tone the book is going for).\n\nWill this issue convert, well, *anyone* who wasn't previously interested in Spawn and his universe? Hell, no. \n\nIf you know exactly what you want from a Spawn title, and are happy to live with the \"quirks\" the title has always struggled with, are you going to enjoy the book? Damn right you will.\n\n\"Spawn! It's **exactly** the book you think it is!!!!\"",
            "The great things about this comic are Jimmy having Mxy\u2019s powers (and Mxy being a powerless civilian, which is interesting) and traveling to the Fifth Dimension to recruit the Justice Imps to save the world with help from Dick, Kara, and the JLA; and Clark, Bruce, and Bat-Mite traveling through dimensions (i.e. Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, and First) before returning to the Third Dimension, with Bruce telling Bat-Mite that Bat-Mite missed all the Silver Age adventures he had with Bruce and that he wants to do a final team-up with Bat-Mite. Also, Clark and Bruce seeing their future selves.\n\nMark Waid has done an excellent job on expanding Mxy and Bat-Mite based on their experiences encountering the World\u2019s Finest. Overall, this comic is great!",
            "I like that the Scrooges of the entire multiverse were able to defeat the Scrooge-Above-All with help from the Council of Gyros and multiple versions of Donald Duck (which makes sense, given that it\u2019s his 90th anniversary), before they told the Scrooge-Above-All that family and adventures are what makes them whole. \n\nI also like that we get to see an epilogue where the Scrooge-Above-All have a Christmas party with his counterparts and that he told them that he was able to spent time and have adventures with his family, since he wasn\u2019t able to meet them on Bear Mountain in 1947.\n\nJason Aaron has done a great job making sure that we get to see an Uncle Scrooge adventure that has been spread across the multiverse. The artists did a great job on it, and all of the covers (aside from the Frank Miller one, which is meme-worthy) is impressive (including the Alex Ross cover, which looks glorious and impressive and is like the artwork of Carl Barks). The missed opportunity should\u2019ve shown Huey, Dewey, and Louie (of the multiverse) helping Scrooge defeat the Scrooge-Above-All, but at least they told him about the multiverse.\n\nOverall, this comic is great, and I hope Disney and Marvel will release one-shots of Disney characters later this year and next year (if they\u2019re up to it and/or if the fans like it)!",
            "I hope they do more of these. It was cool to see Scrooge deal with more comic booky tropes. I just kind of wished they did more with the multiversal Scrooges, like one of them was his Ducktales counterpart or something.",
            "I like that John encountered Olgrun\u2019s grief and pain after being freed from his control, while a construct of Ellie, lrons, and Natasha saved Shirley from harm. from the Star Shroud. Also, Guy saving Sheperd and working together to save John. Overall, this comic is good!",
            "\u201cNo, Hermod, these men are nihilists there\u2019s *nothing* to be afraid of.\u201d",
            "I like that Bruce tried to do whatever it takes to save his clone from being aged up before the he cloned sacrificed his hand so that Bruce could have his hand back before he died in piece. I also like that Bruce got his money, house (although it\u2019s a new manor since he told Savage to keep Wayne Manor because he\u2019s going to find a way to defeat him because new status quo), family, and Selina (who told him about her adventures in Tini Howard\u2019s run, in which they laugh because it\u2019s ridiculous and dumb) back. Overall, this is a good comic and sets a new status quo for the Batman Family after Absolute Power (which might be a lackluster event).",
            "Loved this issue, tough picking my favorite this week between WW and Batman",
            "First issue I've enjoyed in a while. Love the idea of a new home named after Alfred. Also a nice surprise to have Steve Lieber on some of the art, I've missed his work",
            "I liked this one a lot :) despite the ups and downs of the Failsafe Saga, I like this end result. Hope that what comes fulfills the promises of this issue",
            "The panels/pages of Wonder Woman and Cheetah at the campfire are utterly gorgeous\n\nThe Wonder girls are so cute together",
            "Book of the week for me, easily. Standout writing and stunning interior art everywhere you look. King and Sampere have been creatively knocking it out of the park on this Wonder Woman run.",
            "It\u2019s just Diana and Barbara fighting each other for days before they reconciled and saved each other. Also, even though Diana and Barbara encountered each other since the late \u201880s, they don\u2019t personally know each other. At least we get to see a mentioning of Pricilla Rich (whose pre-Crisis Earth-Two self last appeared in the first Crisis and whose pre-Crisis Earth-One/New Earth/Prime Earth self died) and Deborah Domaine (who was cured by Diana off-panel after the first Crisis). Same thing with Tom King continuing Barbara\u2019s redemption since the forgettable and bad Cloonrad run. Also, Diana still saying, \u201cNo Thank You,\u201d to have a modern and memorable catchphrase like Superman and Batman. Meanwhile, we have the Wonder Girls (Donna, Cassie, and Yara) going on the Invisible Plane to rescue Diana. I like that they want to save Diana while having a friendly banter. The missed opportunity should\u2019ve involved them talking to each other about how they became Wonder Girl, join the superhero teams, deal with romantic relationships and continuity problems, and team ups with Diana. Also, Yara is practically Diana\u2019s Robin because sharing mantles and having a sibling bond. Overall, this comic is okay at best.\n\nFor the Super Sons backup, I thought it was wholesome for Jon and Damian to teach Lizzie how to fly a kite. Also, Jon telling Damian to learn about humility as an old chum because Damian is vengeance and night and Kite Man (Hell Yeah!) teaching Lizzie how to fly a kite. Overall, this is a good and wholesome backup!",
            "KITE MAN HELL YEAH :)",
            "\nA gorgeous-looking book, as always. Sampere is the reason to buy this book, plain and simple.\n\nAs for the plot...It remains kind of loose. Cheetah is back to hating Diana this issue, but then returns to being good or at least good-ish by the book's end, which I'm not really a fan of. It turns Barbara into yet another Paula, or Valerie, or Vanessa, or Cale, or Medusa. Is it too much to ask for the most famous and recognizable Wonder Woman villain to remain a villain?\n\nThere's also the bit where Barbara tells Diana that she is the only one who knows her, and...It doesn't really hit, mostly due to Meta-text. This version of Barbara has only existed for eight years, and even if we are working with a hodgepodge of post-crisis continuity with Rebirth overlaid on top of it (I think), Rucka's Rebirth story is the only tale where they really share a strong connection.\n\nIt's kind of hard to swallow because unlike when Lex or Joker tell their archenemies this, there isn't really a well of stories with Diana and Barbara understanding each other personally on some level that I can fall back on to fill the gaps. I guess if nothing else it is kind of interesting to see Cheetah being remolded in real time.\n\nAlso, the space alien learning the human art of speaking that looks like Yara makes another appearance. Good for her.",
            "A clever, visually inventive story that uses the comic book format itself to pull off some cool storytelling. One of those tales that can *only* be told in a comic book, it couldn't work anywhere else. \n\nMy (small) peeve is that Constantine is bordering on being self-parody at times. It feels a little like *Campbell* is channelling Butcher from **The Boys** rather than the (admittedly at times sweary) cunning and clever JC.",
            "I like that an alternate future Eddie (and Venom) became the narrator so that he would tell us about two universes where he never became Venom. It\u2019s interesting!\n\nFor the first part, I like that the Venom of Earth-1048 (aka the PS4 Spider-Man universe) refuse to join Knull\u2019s army during the King in Black back in 2018 before he returned to his universe.\n\nFor the second part, it\u2019s shocking and surprising that the Avengers of another universe were killed by Venom.",
            "It\u2019s hilarious that Jen and Jack found out that Ransak and Karkas used her apartment for something important. I like that Jen traveled to the Impossible City with Carol so that she could meet up with the Avengers before she and Jack has a talk about her JLI in the Avengers and him being back from the dead. Also, Thor and She-Hulk awkward moment since they used to date in Jason Aaron\u2019s Avengers run in 2018. Overall, this is a good comic!",
            "It\u2019s just Jessica and David talking about The Assembly before Jess teamed up with the Assembly to defeat The Screamer. Let\u2019s hope that they realize who Gamma Rod really is so that that can defeat him and Viper and make sure that Jess will save her son Gerry from Hydra and Echidna. Overall, this comic is okay.",
            "Huh, so MJ really didn't know.\n\nNot quite sure what to think about this issue. Checchetto's art is amazing as always, and the fight scene with Kingpin vs Harry and Peter was cool. The cat is finally out of the bag and the Parker family knows Peter is Spider-man, and they are all mostly okay with it (for now...)\n\nBut as an ending for the first arc, it lacks a certain...pizzaz? Or maybe hook for the next part is the right phrase. We could have used a few panels of Fisk plotting his next move, I think.\n\nOh and does anyone know if Kingpin's new Super-strength tattoos are a deep cut to anything?",
            "great issue. im really interested in seeing how USM's sales are doing compared to ASM, considering it has double the pulls here",
            "Fisk: I have cameras everywhere\n\nPeter: Lets take unmasked MJ for a ride\n\nYeaaaah about that",
            "This issue was phenomenal. I was a bit worried based on the previews, I didn't want MJ and Peter to go through relationship drama because of his hero life, mostly because we've been there and we've done that already in many other books, this was rephrasing, this is peak fiction.",
            "No drama. Just support. This is a good family. Peter and MJ are raising good kids. That\u2019s nice. \n\nAnd MJ granting Peter his name is *chef\u2019s kiss.*",
            "The great things about this comic are Peter and Harry working together to have their first encounter with the Kingpin (resulting in Kingpin seeing them very soon) and Peter telling his family (aside from May, since she\u2019s kept it four four months) about him being active as Spider-Man (resulting in Richard and MJ to be surprised and impressed and for MJ to support Peter\u2019s activities as Spider-Man, with her giving the Spider-Man name to him). Jonathan Hickman has done a great job on Peter telling his family about his Spider-Man life, with his family supporting him with little worry because they know he\u2019ll be okay. Let\u2019s hope that the family will get to see Peter in action as Spider-Man. Overall, this comic is great!",
            "As usual, Ultimate MJ is just the best.",
            "We eating good this week folks",
            "That ending put a big smile on my face. Excited to see how the family deals with everything going forward, since things are clearly gonna get messy",
            "A great new addition to the EU. I made a discussion post about this issue. There were ups and downs for me, but overall I\u2019m loving how EU gives us two minis from the GIJoe world at a time to catch us up to speed on the heroes and the villains. I don\u2019t know Watters\u2019 work all that well but I think he did a good job at building a foundation for the story to come inside this mini, even if that came at the expense of having *more* dynamic pages inside this issue itself.",
            "Bruno Redondo makes everything look so good.",
            "It just Dick being passed out by Shelton before he framed Dick as Heartless. That\u2019s it. Also, Zucco (who should\u2019ve remembered his pre-Crisis and pre-Flashpoint death) learning that Dick is Nightwing. Also, Damian having knowledge of every escape route in every building he enters. Overall, this comic is okay.",
            "An action-packed penultimate issue, as the story of Jace Boucher seemingly races towards its conclusion. *Brombal/Fuso* are a great pairing, and their arcs have pumped some much needed life and pace into this title.\n\nOne thing I did find slightly surprising is the introduction of overtly supernatural elements towards the climax of the issue (trying to avoid spoilers here). Yes, I realise this book and SIKTC are all about hunting and killing *monsters*, but the twist at the end of this book kind of took me by surprise, and opens up some interesting possibilities moving forward.",
            "One of the most interesting trends I see on a month to month basis is that Wonder Woman often gets Pull of the Week, while not garnering anywhere near as much engagement or discussion as the other big releases.",
            "It\u2019s just the Titans feeling Vanadia from control (in which I was right about that) before she was killed by Dark-Wing Queen Raven (in which I was half right about that). I feel bad that Vanadia was killed by Dark-Wing Queen Raven, but it was expected since Tom Taylor mashed several storylines in his book to make sense for him and not make sense for us (like his two Jon Kent books). Also, it\u2019s likely that the next three issues will end with the Titans saving Raven from Evil Raven and Evil Raven realizing that she does care about the Titans because they\u2019re her family. My only criticism is making every Raven storyline about her being evil because we\u2019ve seen this storyline for 40 years and that it\u2019s unnecessary. Overall, this comic isn\u2019t terrible, but it\u2019s not good either.",
            "I like that Ben was able to remove Peter\u2019s Spider-Goblin persona before Peter thanked him for saving his life. This is the only good thing about this comic. The rest is just Kamala seeing J.
