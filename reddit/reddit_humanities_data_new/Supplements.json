        "content": "Hello, everyone. \n\nOne of our main goals for this sub is to keep the discussions as honest and informative as possible. In the spirit of transparency, we have to inform you that we get messaged semi-daily with companies requesting permission to advertise and market on /r/supplements. There are also far more companies that will skip this and just directly go into the sub and link to their products in the comments. In many cases they will also create new threads that are pure and unapologetic advertising and self-promotion. \n\nWe want to make it clear that **marketing and advertising is unacceptable in /r/supplements**. We want to keep the discussion by users, for users. If we'd allow companies in, the sub would be ruined very quickly.\n\n**What to avoid:**\n\n- A Reddit username that is also a brand name\n\n- Obvious or subtle marketing, self-promotion, and/or advertising\n\n- Customer research\n\n- Linking to your website which sells supplements\n\nThese rules are in-line with the [Reddit anti-spam policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/submit):\n\n> If your contribution to Reddit consists primarily of submitting links to a business that you run, own or otherwise benefit from, tread carefully. Additionally, if you do not participate in other discussions or reply to comments and questions, you may be considered a spammer and banned from Reddit.\n\nDoing any of the aforementioned things will in all likelihood lead to a permanent ban. Appeals may be accepted in some cases if the user is a long-term contributor to the sub and only made an innocent mistake. There will be no appeal for companies that create new accounts with brand names and come directly to /r/supplements with the intent of marketing, doing customer research, and advertising.\n\n**What we accept:**\n\n- Links to blogs or websites that discuss, compare, or review supplements in a neutral/scientific fashion (examples: examine.com, labdoor.com, personal blogs, etc.). However, if we suspect that the link in question is subtle advertising, we will remove it. There's also different ways to link to blogs/articles. For example, the best way would be to create a text post and summarize the article you want to link to. At the end of the post you simply link the article as a [source](www.placelinkhere.com). This is perfectly fine and it shows us that your main focus is to spread good information and not to self-promote. Direct links to well-known websites like examine or labdoor are fine as well.\n\n- Links to research, news, or anything else relevant to supplements. Though the rules about advertising and marketing still apply\n\n- Discussing brands and their quality: Feel free to share your opinion on brand quality. If we suspect you're doing undercover marketing you might be warned and/or banned (i.e. if you say: \"I really liked x supplement it gave me a lot of energy! You can buy it *here*, *here*, and *here*. And *here's* a discount code you can use). \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts below :)\n\n~ The mod team",

        "content": "BE INFORMED THAT THIS IS ALL ANECDOTAL.\n\nM - 24\n\nHello everyone, after taking fadogia agrestis & tongkat ali for nearly 8 months straight at elevated dosages (yes, I know that\u2019s stupid), I have come off \u201ccold turkey\u201d about a week ago. My regiment was to take it 7 days a week. I\u2019m not a big believer in \u201c5 on, 2 off\u201d ; as it is completely wrecking your blood concentrations & keeping your body in a constant state of hormonal imbalance. \n\nFirstly, I\u2019d like to say that in this time, I had elevated my testosterone from 500ng/dl to 800ng/dl. Originally, I had felt great; elevated sex drive, great vigor, and mood enhancement. However, like anything else, it\u2019s shine starts to fade after prolonged use, and I was no longer feeling the benefits. However, I assumed that this was now my \u201cbaseline\u201d and continued to utilize the supplements. \n\nWell, after my most recent labs, I had noticed an elevated kidney profile (not damaged, but elevated) and decided it was time to come off. HERE is where I messed up. I had assumed that the 300ng/dl jump wasn\u2019t substantial enough to make me feel any certain way, and so I came off \u201ccold turkey\u201d. Holy shit. \n\nDay 1: I was absolutely fine and felt no detrimental sides. All was right with the world.\n\nDay 2: Slightly more anxious, but bearable. \n\nDay 3: Ehh something is wrong. I don\u2019t feel like myself. I\u2019m starting to feel like a \u201cshell\u201d of my former self. It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling other than the world just seems \u201cgrey\u201d. I have slight drive, and little to no motivation. \n\nDay 4: Something is absolutely wrong. The world is dull and grey, I have no motivation to get out of bed, I slept horribly, I woke up anxious, my vigor had been zapped, and I\u2019m freaking out. \n\nDay 5: FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK. I knew something was horribly wrong when I woke up. I still went into work and fulfilled my responsibilities. However, the moment I hit my bed; my chest locked up, heart rate went through the roof, began to shake, could barely move, and my mental health went straight to the floor. Full on panic attack. \n\nDay 6: I woke up feeling more normal than I had the previous 3 days. I\u2019m more-so back to day 2(ish). I woke up with an erection (which I hadn\u2019t since day 1 of stopping). However, still not my \u201cnormal\u201d, of how I\u2019d felt before touching this stuff.\n\nI think that alongside my test plummeting, my estrogen has also been tanked. My estro was on the higher side while on these supps, & i\u2019m assuming that when they were discontinued, I completely destroyed my e2 ; i.e. my hormones are all outta wack & i\u2019m like a woman going through menopause. Like seriously. \n\nWas wondering if anyone else had experience something similar? Either on these supplements or not. And if so, how long was the recovery process? \n\nTo conclude, don\u2019t be like me and take these thing irresponsibly thinking \u201coh they\u2019re over the counter, it\u2019ll be fine\u201d. Yes, even otc supps can jack you up. Play it safe. \n\n\n",

I\u2019m a little confused because I\u2019ve also read that it can be stimulating for some people. I know everyone reacts differently but is it normal to feel sleepy? Should I take it before bedtime instead? I have pretty bad insomnia/sleep anxiety so I\u2019m wondering if this would help. \n\nAlso want to note that I\u2019m feeling itchy and my face feels flushed. From what I understand NAC can increase histamine? Does this go away over time?",
