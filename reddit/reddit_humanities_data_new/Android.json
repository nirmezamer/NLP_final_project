            "This thought process is why companies get away with locking down the OS and pushing developers out.

There's no practical way to make edits in one app and have those edits show up in the other app. It's insulting. You're better off sharing as a pdf from the Samsung notes app.",

            "Any used phone for that budget will absolutely annihilate this phone.",
            "Hilarious that for that same price in like 2016? The Redmi 4 prime had 3gb of ram too and similar storage, and a 1080p screen. Surely they'd be able to at least put 128GB and 6gb of bottom shelf ram in it 8 years later...",
            "just don't bother with these lowest tier budget phones, everything is so slow",
            "this is a ripoff for sure",
            "Still overpriced for the spec",
            "G36 shouldn't be acceptable anymore. At worst case unisoc t612 or helio g85.",
            "There's a slightly better A3x with T603",
            "Also no NFC in an era of tap to pay (not necessarily a deal breaker, just an annoying omission)",
            "I have Redmi A1 in the family with Helio A22 and 2gb ram. Its slow as hell and very glitchy. Even with stock android its barely usable.",
            "Wait isn't this phone from like 2018-19?",
            "I don't know about the CPU but I still have an old phone (>5 year) with 3GB of RAM and it is fine for light usage.",
            "I can't imagine using 6gb of ram on Android with how badly optimized the operating system is. 3gb would be a nightmare.\n\n3gb is fine for IOS, but the idea of anyone releasing an Android phone with less than 8gb is insane.",
            "No NFC? Strange...",
            ">\u2022extremely inexpensive\n\nIts 130USD about 200AUD.\n\n200 AUD can get you the[ Moto G54 easily](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/search/node/moto%20g54)\n\nhttps://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=12543&idPhone2=12822\n\nYeah, nah.  Its a garbage phone.  Needs to be sub 100USD/150 AUD at the minimum.",
            "Yep, even if they're likely not to be supported anymore and will run an old version of MIUI (I'm very familiar with Xiaomi devices, so I can't talk too much about other brands). For what it costs or less a Note 8 Pro, even the Note 9S/Pro, can for example be found with far better hardware.\n\n0.08MP auxiliary camera?",
            "You might be confusing it with Mi A3 which was a different line, this is Redmi A3.",
            "Not strange. NFC is not available in many budget phones. It's also region dependent.",
            "Says $90 for me \n\nVersus $170 for MotoG54 \n\nSo almost double the cost",
            "would much rather just have a note9/s10 at that point, my poco f5 cost around the equivalent of 400 aud"
