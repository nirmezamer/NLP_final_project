        "content": "**1. There's a lot of Persona 5 games! Which ones do I get?**\n---\n\n  It is recommended to start with Persona 5 Royal. Please note Royal specifically, not \"Persona 5.\" While a different game, it is missing content compared to Royal. \n\n  If you want to read more about the different games, please read below:\n\n  1. Persona 5 (P5) is the vanilla game, often called P5 Vanilla or base game. It goes from April to December in-game.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Royal (P5R) is the updated game, released after Persona 5. It has the base game + Royal contents, which is sprinkled within the base game and then has another semester in the January month.\n\n  Note that you can't use saves from P5 for P5R.\n\n  There are requirements to getting to the bulk of the Royal content, ie Third Semester/January.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Strikers (P5S), or Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers, is a sequel to P5/P5R, but it doesn't mention P5R characters. It is a musou game similar to Dynasty Warriors.\n\n  If you want more P5 after beating the game, you can buy this next if the other Persona games don't interest you.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Tactica (P5T) is an SRPG compared to the previous games. It's set somewhere during February but before P5 Strikers.\n\n  You can play this game before or after P5S. This does not narratively affect P5S.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Dancing (P5D), or Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, is a rhythm game where you watch characters dance.\n\n  It's not narratively connected to anything, but it is best played after P5/P5R.\n\n  1. Persona Q 2 (PQ2) is a dungeon crawling game in the vein of the Etheryian series that includes the Persona 3 (both the original [Remake a good one to play] and Portable) and Persona 4 casts.\n\n  Best played after the P3, P4, and the base game, but it is set around November, so you can play it after the 7th Palace.\n\n  It is only playable on the 3DS.\n\n  1. Persona 5 X (P5X) is a mobile gacha-game based on an alternate world. Its main cast is another set of Persona users in the P5 timeline, and the OG cast does make cameos. It first came from China is slowly releasing in Taiwan and Korea. \n\n  No official English version yet.\n\n**2. How do I access P5R's new content: Third Semester?**\n---\n\n  You only need to get Councillor to Rank 9 by 11/17. On 11/18, you'll get Rank 10 automatically as a cut-scene.\n\n  You may have heard Justice and Faith are required, but that's based on old news when P5R was just released. They give cutscenes, fleshing their characters.\n\n  For the True Ending, you do not need Justice nor Faith, but they give extra scenes.\n\n  For more information on Councillor, Faith, and Justice requirements for extra content, check this [spoiler comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/177o7sp/compiling_some_subreddit_guides_and_tips/k4w5m15/).\n\n  For more tips: \n\n  1. If you want to access both the Vanilla ending and Third Semester without replaying the game:\n      1. Create a back-up save file on 11/17 afternoon while Councillor is Rank 8. DO NOT LOSE THIS FILE.\n      2. DO NOT DO Councillor Rank 9 on 11/17. Instead, do something else on the main save file.\n      3. Proceed with the game into the Vanilla Ending.\n      4. Return to the save file from Step 1, and do Councillor Rank 9 on 11/17.\n      5. Proceed to Rank 10 on 11/18 and towards the Third Semester.\n\n  1. It's X-month! Will I make it to the Third Semester? \n      1. Unless it's very late into November, October and November has a lot of availability. Theoretically, there are 9 days in November before 11/17, but I highly suggest not to do this.\n\n**3. I need help on 5th Palace/Okumura's Boss!**\n---\n\n  Use the command !OkumuraGuide. You can also check the Guides on the sidebar for the same guide.\n\n  [Here is an example of how it works](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1cjlilu/persona_5s_subreddit_faq/l2grg4i/)\n\n**4. I need help on the Royal/Third Semester Boss!**\n---\n\n  Check this [spoiler comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/16wbkkt/how_long_does_this_boss_take_to_beat/k2wxcxa/).\n\n**5. Guides**\n---\n\n  I typically use [GameFaqs for guides](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/260936-persona-5-royal/faqs/78212).\n\n  Thank you, u/ZOLTANstudios, for [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLWmcW6PYv0T4Mcfwy18Xxh859q_GQtkkRa6KOV9Rog/edit?usp=sharing) that contains a list of Personas for tracking, traits, itemizations, etc.\n\n  Thank you, u/lazy_bread442, for [an optimized P5R NG+ Builds guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/hi1be8/p5r_new_game_plus_optimized_builds_with_steps/).\n\n  Thank you, u/bryanktr, for [a guide testing P5R's Battle Mechanics](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gksz73/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_1_damage_boosts/).\n\n**6. Fusion Calculators**\n---\n\n  There are 2 main Royal calculators:\n      1. [aqiu384](https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/p5r/personas)\n      2. [Chinhodo](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/list)\n\n  I prefer using aqiu384's calculator since it also gives the level ranges for Treasure Demon fusions, which Chinhodo is missing.\n  aqiu384's calculator also has itemizations, skills, and they recently added a way to calculate how to get a specific Persona.\n\n**7. Need help with Maxing Confidants without a day-to-day guide?**\n---\n\n  Try reading this [guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/l3hicr/algorithm_to_maxing_all_confidants_in_a_single/?share_id=ZZi7GGl0EGSedByKPzOfW).",

However, it doesn't change the fact >!you do get out of prision!<.",

It's literally the final frames of the game. *No* other confidant gives extra scenes *within the game ending*. Yoshizawa doesn't, for instance.\n\nThere's literally someone on the sub as we speak asking \"how do I get the secret ending\" (that is, the one where >!Akechi appears at the station!<) and being told flat-out \"you only need Maruki for the true ending\".\n\nI know better than to think I'm going to change your mind, but that's misinformation. It's not answering the question the user asked. It is simply not true.\n\nedit: like, if you're really wedded to this \"the postcredit scene during the game ending that you only get if you get the true ending is not part of the true ending\" thing, then surely you could say \"there is a postcredit scene after the true ending that is longer if you max Akechi's confidant\" or something? But don't just mislead people, c'mon."

            "A lot of people are super biased about the romancing. I would say play however you feel like playing. For example, if you date Futaba in-game (which some players hate), that\u2019s fine too! Its a bit of a roleplaying game for the most part and Joker is like 16 or 17.\n\nYou could also choose all of them and see what\u2019s what, but you better prepare for the consequences in the future.",
            "Reject the opinions of internet strangers, Embrace romancing your hot homeroom teacher",
            "While the canon is that of a highschooler, they do provide options for all audiences playing persona. \n\nGatekeepers are stupid and you should ignore them. If you think Kawakami is hot, fuckin go for it. If you think Futaba is hot, also go for it.\n\nPlus if you were to show me all of the characters in persona and say they were based in universities, I would probably believe you. A lot of anime in general tends to have that strange trope.",
            "Some people like being upset. This is true even outside of PS5. You can't make sense of nonsense because that's by design, and lets them stay upset.",
            "I believe it's the developers inclusion that they have a problem with, which is perfectly valid. I also find the decision kinda icky.\n\nJust because I'm not forced to engage with the content doesn't mean you can't still have problems with said content.",
            "People take this shit way too seriously and romance discussions often feel more heated than political discussions. Either way, you get a lot of name calling and bad faith arguments from both. Personally, if someone is romancing Kawakami, I'm going to assume they're doing so because they're romancing as themselves...unless their arguments are unironically defending pedophilia, which some do.\n\nLikewise, if someone romances one of the thieves, I'm going to assume they're doing it because they think that character works best as Ren...unless they're horny posting in a way that makes it clear it's for their own personal pleasure. And some people do that too. The pedophilia from both sides is creepy, but it doesn't make up all the shippers on either end.\n\nPersonally I'm in the camp that likes to pair characters together. I really don't get the appeal in \"romancing as yourself\" especially since the romances aren't written to accommodate that mindset. But I don't begrudge anyone who does want to play the game that way either.",
            "Hey man, welcome to the club. Anime characters aren't real, but some people will be mad for the sake of being mad and apply real world rules on anime character.\n\nThis is as stupid as seeing a criminal in a movie stealing a car, they start crying and bitching cause stealing is bad, like bruh... no shit.\n\nYou don't have to like all the characters, but stories are for the sake of telling stories.",
            "How you approach the subject of a romantic partner depends on how you see the game. Some people envision themselves in that situation, and under the assumption that they're 20+, they would prefer to pursue relationships with people their age and feel icky about doing so with high-school aged people. Others morph their perspective to fit the role of the high school student and will thus flip the script; they'll want Akiren to date a fellow high schooler and not want an adult-teen romance on their conscience. Others still simply won't care either way and won't prescribe real world morality to a fantasy game. Others yet still will abstain from romance altogether for any number of reasons. The game was built with all different approaches, hence why all these options exist, and none of them are the one and only correct way of viewing the game. What you're seeing in action are the various sides of the community refusing to acknowledge the others as valid, so it's a fools errand figuring out who's right when none of them are. Just play the game however feels right to you.",
            "thats a good take on it, my advise is to not give much of a fuck to any of that, there is a lot of people in the internet on the lookout to be offended by something.",
            "Truthfully, just ignore them. Play the game, romance who you want. Heck if your a completionist romance everyone. Those people cant be happy and simply can't enjoy the game.",
            "**I'm not sure what the question being asked is?**\nAnyway.\n\n* Yes kawakami (Your teacher) is a Romance. \n\n* Yes its 100% Optional as are all the Romances. \n\nAnyone who would say that Ren (Joker) is a groomed character is clearly someone who should have their opinion card taken away. That or they have never played Persona 5. \n\nKawakami for me is second best girl right after Futaba.\nIts a video game at the end of the day, so its not that big of a deal. \nRegardless Op Have fun with P5 its really good.\n\nLastly!\nIt should go without saying but... If you are a Minor In real life, plz dont date adults. If you are an adult in real life, plz dont date a Minor.",
            "This is one of my favorite games of all time; and I think it\u2019s weird that you can romance adults as a child. Just let me be an adult in one of these games already.",
            "Kawakami is MVP. She'll come over and give you a massage on your hardest days, so you can go out and spend time with someone else.",
            "Kawamommy For Life And Secondly it's your game bro so do what you want and unlike kamoshida it's up to you as the player to do it so if you don't like that sort of stuff just steer clear of them my guy it's your game not theirs.",
            "If you like the any romance confidant and want to ship with them, just go. People have different opinions and preferences, so of they don\u2019t like certain confidant doesn\u2019t mean you have to follow them.",
            "Just romance qho ever you want, every romanceable option can be questioned either by you being a pedo, the romanceable one being a pedo etc, but all in all, ots just a game and joker isnt getting groomed and you are not a pedo for interacting with minors inside of the game",
            "It's optional \n\nPeople are just upset it's an option at all",
            "Enjoy the game however the hell you want, really. It's more of a debate within the canon of how things work where you take the character at face value, but your own experience is your own experience.",
            "That\u2019s just kinda the thing. Lots of people view lots of things differently, so yeah. I personally don\u2019t like the adult confidants because even if they are optional, there still at heart the same people, so yeah\u2026 and also most of the subject matter in them is weird. And also I always found those whole arguments against people who romance the minors weird cause like, your playing the role of a 16-17 year old, it makes sense that you would date someone in your age range.",
            "It's optional. If you played P3R, then you know Ken right? In the portable version, Femc can romance Ken. I just skip all the guy social links lmao. There's also an option to reject them. It'll break the link though. But that's only in Persona 3 i think.\n\n>!Shinji is my romance for FeMC!<\n\nJust enjoy the game. I romance all of them on my second playthrough of P5R. Lmao cause why not.",
            "Yeah those people are stupid. My personal head cannon is that joker can date anyone around his age, because the adults would amount to pedophilia. But that\u2019s my personal head cannon and unlike the people who complain, I don\u2019t care about who other people choose to romance. It\u2019s just a very good game, not real life",
            "What is love?",
            "I think its weird that the devs included it but if you want to romance the teacher that is 100% your business",
            "Joker is underage, so dating younger characters isn't that of a big deal to me.\n\nI have always been attracted to older women when I was young. If there weren't any laws regarding that, then I would've dated older women back then.\n\nAll that I'm saying is that I don't mind what others think of the game; I'd like to enjoy it through my own lenses",
            "If you really want to get groomed by the teacher, do it. No one can stop you",
            "It is groom or to be groomed",
            "It\u2019s just a game, people are chronically online. Don\u2019t worry too much about it",
            "I personally could not romance some characters because it would feel weird; one of them feels too much like a sister, some of them are creepy adults. But that's just me. I got no problem with anyone's choices, and no one should. It says nothing about you as a person, it's just about which characters you like.",
            "I think it\u2019s fine to not like the inclusion of it. Though I think it\u2019s mainly for people who don\u2019t wanna romance high schoolers. But I think people often underlook Kawakamis character because of it",
            "One group says you shouldn\u2019t romance the teens because they\u2019re underage. Another group says you shouldn\u2019t romance the adults because Joker\u2019s underage. \n\nBased people know they\u2019re just cgi models on a screen",
            "I heard the game instantly sends a signal to your nearest law enforcement agency and puts you on the infamous list depending on your choice.",
            "The only real choice is to romance everybody and let the haters square that circle.",
            "Look at them, wandering around like a clown.",
            "That means there a tons of players romancing Futaba and the fandom doesn't even notice and honestly I think it's better that way.",
            "I named my Joker \"F***ing Kawakami\" just so the classes knew who I was going to romance.",
            "It's so weird that the first arc of the game is \"This teacher is despicable because he wants to date students!\" and then later there's the option to date Kawakami. It feels inconstant.",
            "3 dots connect to a rectangle",
            "Until I read the subtitles, I thought Junpei was saying \"clowning around like a clown\" and I was all, how else would a clown act?",
            "You just made my day.",
            "Yeah. It\u2019s a good storyline imo but she\u2019s not my favorite LI",
            "For me, my personal issue is that Futaba should be with anyone BUT Joker. I could see her with Yusuke, Ann, Ryuji, Kasumi, et cetera, but... Joker just feels like they're better as friends tbh.",
            "Yoshizawa going \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 F***ing Kawakami, yes?\u201d",
            "Just saying kamoshida raped and sexually harassed the female students i don't think its comparable",
            "The teacher is despicable for way more beyond dating the students but yeah",
            "Unfortunately I suspect for many particularly male players, combined with the maid outfit its a fantasy element.",
