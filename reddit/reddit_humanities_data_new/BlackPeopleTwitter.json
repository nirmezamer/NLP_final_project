            "I thought it might be interesting for some here to read one translated article on the Ruud Gullit blackface fans at the Dutch-Poland EK football game. (disclosure, not black, but American in the Netherlands. Don't like blackface)\n\n[https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/artikel/5455901/verkleed-als-ruud-gullit-en-daarom-racistisch-ik-stop-ermee](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/artikel/5455901/verkleed-als-ruud-gullit-en-daarom-racistisch-ik-stop-ermee)\n\nDressed as Ruud Gullit and therefore racist? I'll stop doing that then!\n\nUsually the Orange supporters abroad get the news in a positive way, but some supporters dressed as Ruud Gullit get criticism for their black-faced faces. That would be racist. For one of Gullit's doppelgangers, it is the reason to stop his imitation.\n\nThe fake Ruud Gullits were visible in many photos and images. The British newspaper Daily Mail writes that there is criticism of Dutch fans with black-strict faces. \"Netherlands fans are accused of doing 'blackface' in to dress up as legend Ruud Gullit at Euro 2024 victory over Poland,\" the newspaper headlines.\n\nOne of Gullit's doppelgangers says anonymously to RTL News that he himself gets 'only nice reactions' as a look-a-like from Gullit. Yet today he decided to stop. \u201cThat fuss made me think. Perhaps it evokes unpleasant feelings in others, even though I really adore Gullit and therefore imitating him. I will accept that sincerely.\u201d\n\nPreviously, he was of the opinion that his black make-up, as he calls it himself, is a tribute to Gullit. The former footballer became European champion in 1988 with the Dutch. \u201cI\u2019m a perfectionist, which is why I\u2019ve looked at the details. I also wear the lottery shoes that Gullit had on.\u201d\n\nOn X are for -and opponents for the Gullit look-a-likes. Critics, especially from abroad, refer to black petioly and say: there you have those Dutch again, with their blackface tradition.\n\nOthers find this kind of response to the Gullit imitations but exaggerated. They see it as something fun and don\u2019t understand why you shouldn\u2019t make a look at a footballer\u2019s attention.\n\nIf white people make themselves black to look like a black person, it\u2019s called blackface. Several researchers showed that tradition is racist because it originated in times of colonialism and slavery.\n\nSociologist Aspha is an expert in the Dutch colonial past. Blackface was created at the time, with the goal of ridiculing black people. As a result, it is hurtful, even if it may not be intended or with the intention to imitate your football hero, Bijnaar explains. \u201cIt easily rolls out of your mouth that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. People ignore the impact of that intent.\u201d\n\nBee to ask if supporters also dress up as well-known white footballers of that time. \"Would there have been fuss if supporters disguised as the brothers De Boer?\"\n\nThe 'Gullit' that RTL News spoke, says that he chose Gullit, because Guus Hiddink is much more difficult, according to him. \"And maybe I would have been a good John the Wolff if he had been very big in 1988. It was Ruud.\u201d\n\nAbroad, there is often little understanding for Dutch people who do not understand that the face of black face is racist, as is also evident from reports in the media.\n\nAccording to Bijnaar, this has to do with the Dutch self-image. \u201cWe see the Netherlands as a tolerant country, we think we can say anything. It comes from arrogance. Who are they to say that we are not allowed to carry out our traditions - by the way?\"\n\nSociologist Bijnaar thinks it helps to listen to someone\u2019s objections. \"You can also say: I want to know what the other person thinks, what that stumbling off is in.\"\n\nShe thinks people should make more space in their heads and their hearts for those who feel hurt or racist. \u201cIt\u2019s empathetic when you say: I didn\u2019t realize that the effect of my actions brought you about it. My apologies, I won't do it again.\"\n\nThat is what the imitator we spoke to now does. \u201cIt turns out that I bump in people\u2019s heads. That's the last thing I really want. So I decide to stop.\u201d\n\nRuud Gullit himself\n\nEarlier, the man said that he is curious what the former footballer of the Orange thinks himself. \u201cIt does something to me. I try to get in touch with him myself to ask if he thinks it is racist what I did.\u201d\n\nRTL News has tried to reach Gullit to ask what he thinks of the fuss, but did not get a hold of him.\n\n\u00a0",

A 30 and 50 likely have less distance in this regard.  Hence why 30-50 would be seen as less bad than a 20-40.  \nThose early 20s girls dating late 20s guys are liable to be a fair bit less mentally mature than their bf.  Exactly how much of a gap there is is pretty variable, though, so I'd have to refrain from judgement until I knew the two better."

She had a flat belly the entire time and started having what she described as stomach cramps all of a sudden.\n\nThey gave the child up for adoption because they were both 17 at the time.

My work had to send me home multiple times and gave me medical leave to figure shit out. Went to a specialty clinic for several different tests, ultrasounds, uncomfortable discovery procedures; nothing abnormal was found. Got put on a specific BC hormone regimen and it cleared it all up. That was back in 2015ish. It started happening again last year (to a lesser degree) and once again a change in the hormones fixed it. \n\nThankful for my doctors listening to me and coming up with solutions when an obvious cause hasn't been found for me.

Most people do not comprehend exactly what happens during pregnancy. How organs are moved out of the way. How your teeth can fall out because placenta will take all the calcium that it needs whether you have enough or not. How joints will become so flexible that it is very easy to dislocate them as the body prepares the pelvis for delivery. How it can throw your hormones so far out of whack that you can be perfectly healthy before pregnancy and die before you give birth of high blood pressure from preeclampsia. Pregnancy is not seen as a major medical event when it very very much is.

I was diagnosed 15 years ago, tried every thing to help with the pain, all the birth control the damn surgery to remove what they could (it would just grow back), my diet went down to nothing that had any taste, was working out 5 days a week and nothing helped.   I had a hysterectomy 3 months ago, and the only thing left is one ovary to avoid having to go on hormone medications. I'm no longer in pain every single day, I have a bad day, probably 4x  month from the pain because my endo was stage 4, so it's on my colon and such as well.  However, I'll take the being laid up 4 days a month over 20+ days a month from the pain.  My heart goes out to you and the person above you with endo.\n\nMy only advice is to find yourself a good doctor who specializes in endometriosis and will take your pain seriously. I dealt with years of doctors that didn't take me seriously, told me the pain was in my head, that I was being hysterical, that I was clearly an addict (despite my always negative drug tests), that I developed severe depression that I'm now having to battle.  Towards the end before my hysterectomy I was making trips to Colorado for the green to help with the pain but my doctor supported me and was the one who suggested it after the pharmacy refused to fill a script for 10 pain meds for me. Don't let the doctors get in your head and tell you you're wrong or don't know your own body.  \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry about your diagnosis, and all my positive thoughts are with you on this journey.  It's life-long as there is no cure, not even a hysterectomy is a cure because it can grow back even without a uterus.",
