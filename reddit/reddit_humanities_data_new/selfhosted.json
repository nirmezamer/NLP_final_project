        "content": "#Welcome to /r/selfhosted!\n\nWe thank you for taking the time to check out the subreddit here! \n\n##Self-Hosting\n\nThe concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Taking away the \"unknown\" factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. \n\n##Some Examples\n\nFor instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud\n\nOr let's say you're used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. \n\nThe possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. \n\n##Subreddit Wiki\n\nThere have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no *officially* hosted wiki, we do have a [github repository](https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki). There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the [reddit-based wiki](/r/selfhosted/wiki)\n\n##Since You're Here...\n\nWhile you're here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important **[rules](/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules)**\n\nWhen posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn't fit in another category, we will get it added! **[Message the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted)** to get that started.\n\nIf you're brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.\n\n[Awesome Self-Hosted App List](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted)\n\n[Awesome Sys-Admin App List](https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin)\n\n[Awesome Docker App List](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker)\n\nIn any case, lot's to take in, lot's to learn. Don't be disappointed if you don't catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We're available to help! \n\nAs always, happy (self)hosting!",

Other rPi is external proxy, VPN and secondary pihole.\n\nThe 'server' is also serving as NAS, so has some RAID disk configs, and is the one hosting game servers, essentially because it has 128GB RAM, Nextcloud, Jellyfin and other file related services.

It made it impossible to link points to a specific user, hence statistics calculation was imperfect and any other user, signed up to Dawarich, could see other users' points. Since the introduction of the necessary usage of API key to send geolocation data from mobile apps (both OwnTracks and Overland), this is no longer a problem. Points are being linked to a user and the ones that were created before this change are linked to the very first user in your Dawarich system automatically.\n\n# Imports\n\nRecently, Google announced sunsetting the storage of user location history on their web platform, moving it to user's devices instead. Users can now order a Takeout from their own devices. And looks like this Takeout has a different format from the two they already have (Records.json and Semantic History Location). Unfortunately, I don't have an example of such an export file, but as soon as I have one, I'll work on supporting its import to Dawarich as well. For now, Dawarich supports Google Takeout's Records.json and Semantic History Location, GPX files and OwnTracks export files. More to come.\n\n# Map\n\nI love how the heatmap looks like on Dawarich's map, and how routes started to look a lot better after I introduced rules to split them, but this last change requires a bit more explanation.\n\nIn the first versions, Dawarich rendered one single route that connected all the points on the map. It made the map kind of unreadable (see the screenshot). One of my friends suggested splitting routes based on time and distance between consecutive points. The idea looks like this: points are being connected to form a route on the map, unless the time between one of the points and the other is more than 1 hour. If that's the case, these points are not being connected, and the route ends. The same goes for distance: if the distance between two consecutive points is more than 500 meters, the route ends. These conditions are working on an \"OR\" basis, if one of them is true, the route ends.\n\nThese settings can be changed by a user in the Settings section starting release 0.7.1\n\n[Before route splitting](https://preview.redd.it/bw3y675t9x7d1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aeaa8ee6d33f0ce17556491265de7213b20fdd6)\n\n[After route splitting](https://preview.redd.it/ewwfc981ax7d1.png?width=3434&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec0497afd81362c7a625a994e40a99270e5b4bb)\n\n# More to come\n\nThe development of Dawarich doesn't stop. I have plenty ideas, most interesting (in my opinion) are:\n\n* \"Fog of War\" mode (if you know, you know)\n* API to read points, import data, and so on\n* Notification system to make events happening under the hood more transparent for the user\n* Update statistics to render more information\n* Monthly/yearly digests of your data and insights\n\nThe list is not exhaustive, more you can see at the [development board](https://github.com/users/Freika/projects/3) or suggest in the [discussions section](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/discussions) or right here in the comments under this post.\n\nAny questions, ideas, and contributions are most welcome!\n\n  \nP.S.

            "OK finally lol (not against you)\n\nI was lamenting recently on a lack of self hosted, FOSS <track my location> platform.\n\nCurrently I denote my GPS location before snapping my photos, but I was hoping on a better method of streamlining that so I could leverage my phone + my own service without relying on Google to keep track\n\nI don't know much around the security implications of GPS on my device, but I assume the data on the phone is what this uses and parses?\n\nThanks for the project.  Looking forward to it",
            "No idea what it is.",
            "Wait so you're saying that I've had the tab with your previous post open for almost 4 months? Damn.\n\nI guess the docker container should be my excuse to finally try this out.",

            "Will check it out, thanks. I've tried OwnTracks a few times but the documentation focuses on the wrong thing and it seems hit or miss if it works on Android. It never seems to 'just work' for long.",
            "Looks interesting, will definitely check it out, thanks.\n\nWondering if it'd be doable to have Home Assistant (which already tracks location) update the location instead of using a separate app, should be just an API call I assume?",

            "hmmm I'll definitely try it",
            "I love the way the interface looks. I see value in the tracking. I don't quite get the logic of Overland, but that is a whole different story.\n\nIt records 'points' 10 times a minute just laying around on my table. I believe google's tracker is not that... diligent. I'd be happy to check in with the location once in a while unless actively asking the app to track my every step. It might be a configuration issue, of course.\n\nGreat job!",
            "Amazing idea and great to see Google sunsetting or enshittifying services spurs FOSS alternatives to step it up and for the community to grow for them.\n\nTwo questions however:\nHow does this app handle multi-device location reports and possible conflicts?\n\ni.e. you have two phones, one is with you, on the go, the other back at home or somewhere else, stationary, but possibly reporting minimal movement due to GPS signal jitter especially without line of sight to satellites.\n\nBonus question: considering Google's Takeout data typically will only have the last 18 months of data I'm considering importing several takeouts to cover a more complete history. If those takeouts overlap, will Dawarich dedupe them?",
            "This looks cool! Which app would you suggest for tracking location? OwnTracks or Overland?",
            "I currently use Traccar for location tracking because it integrates well with Home Assistant.  I've had some minor issues with Traccar, so I'd love to try an alternative.  Is there multi-user support?",

            "This looks pretty awesome, thanks!\n\nI saw the e-mails about changes to google's location history and was curious what alternatives there are.   I have a bunch of json files with my location history created by Tasker, but it'd be nice to be able to import my google location history instead.\n\nI used to use owntracks but had no idea it was still being maintained.  I'll check it out again.   Overland for android looks like it is no longer maintained though.\n\n> unless the time between one of the points and the other is more than 1 hour. If that's the case, these points are not being connected, and the route ends. The same goes for distance: if the distance between two consecutive points is more than 500 meters, the route ends. \n\nAny idea how this looks for flights or long train/car rides?   Flying you probably won't have gps/data at all, but I'm wondering if it's look weird when driving through some rural areas without signal too.",
            "Maybe I'm missing something, but should a user import both Records.json AND the monthly Semantic History Location files? Or is either (individually) sufficient?",

            "This looks fantastic, rather than own tracks, think there's anyway to use the home assistant app? It already does my location (I use it over tailscale/wireguard vpn) battery stats and a bunch more...",

It's not a complex feature, so I'll add it in the future.\n\n  \nMy Takeout exported whole 12 years of location history, but anyway, there is a check to prevent creating points with same datetime, latitude and longitude. You can even try to import the same file multiple times, points will be created only once. So yeah, there is a deduplication feature :)",

I\u2019ve took a closer look at the app. It seems that your setting prevent the database from receiving/saving too much extra data, but it does not affect how the app keeps looking for and analyzing all the data points. It still does actively work in the background, drain the battery, but then discards the points that do not fit your criteria before submitting them to the server. I will test a bit more though as I would love to see how it goes.",

E.g. I have one that turns wifi on if my gps says I'm near my home, and another that saves my gps location to a .json file every 5 minutes or so.\n\nIt can also send http requests, so I might try and use it to send to the owntracks api endpoint to see if it works.",

I've got one for my Nikon and it only cost like 30 bucks.\n\nOn android the setting is settings > location > location services > Google location accuracy.\n\nThat submits nearby WiFi and Bluetooth devices to Google and they return enhanced accuracy information (based on data scraped by Google's street view cars) to help the phone get a fix more accurately than gps (or glonas / Galileo) alone. If that's turned off your phone's location is not sent to Google but photos are still tagged.",

I didn't mind the when, I definitely cared about the where.\n\nI've had the history settings turned off for a long time now, years and years, but I've always removed geotagging from my phone.  I can use Darktable to manipulate and do batch work on my raw photos so I'll be adding local geotagging information based on the day/project I was working on that day \n\nImmich is going to be part of my stack soon, I lost a drive and have been in a limbo state, so trying to get things sorted out now and ahead of getting a new setup working in my environment",

Immich's app of course deliberately doesn't do that Immich can build it's map but presumably you are in control of your Immich instance.",

            "Yeah at the time it was a big no-no and being able to share albums with my wife was a nightmare without a solution that didn't have cross platform support \n\nI use a really mashed up rclone/rsync setup currently because it works for my needs, but not for sharing and for having a non cloud based setup.\n\nI also had a plan to keep an off site GPS tracking service that doesn't rely on Google maps etc so this + Immich are going to be good companions moving forward"
