Thanks for the cutting-edge legal analysis there.\n\nThe Establishment Clause literally stands for the principle that the government cannot mandate a religion. That's it when it comes to the actual text of the Constitution, everything else is a gray area of what amounts to \"establishment\" of a religion. Current precedent, all of 19 years old, has held that a state courthouse can't post the 10 Commandments in its hallway, even if it is posted with secular items as well, but a state park can have a monument  to the 10 Commandments as long as it is partially secular. That is where the line was drawn, and both decisions were 5-4, so it's not like SCOTUS sent a particularly strong message here.\n\nTo be clear, I too think this crosses the line, but the point is this isn't some clear and flagrant violation of the Constitution, just you're own personal and clearly non-legal interpretation of the Constitution.",
            "The establishment clause means you cannot create a state church. This is specifically referring to the common practice of European countries where you have things like the Church of England or the Church of Sweden.
