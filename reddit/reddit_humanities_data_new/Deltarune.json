Until confirmed otherwise, Kris should be referred to with they/them pronouns.\n\nIf you're wondering why it matters, or anything else, for that matter, [this very well-written post* contains the answer to almost any question you could have; please give it a read!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/uj8m5i/frisk_chara_and_kris_are_nonbinary_and_why_it) It's not long, and is broken down into easily digestible images.\n\nIf you get into arguments about it, nothing is going to become of it. It will be removed. It just makes a lot of extra work for the mods, and makes a bunch of people angry. So please don't do that!\n\nThank you for understanding <3 If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them under this post, assuming I haven't had to lock it. Trans rights are human rights, have a nice day, bye! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n*^(Although the post specifically discusses the topic of Kris being nonbinary, which is not considered an objective fact by the mod team\\*\\* & subreddit rules, it effectively answers many questions about Kris using they/them anyway, so I've linked it.)",

But this sub is so violently transphobic that they won't listen and will continue to come up with any pathetically desperate reason as to how Kris somehow isn't nonbinary. It's sad that nonbinary people have to prove that they exist and that woman and men are just accepted automatically. Like so many people on this sub pull the \"I'm not transphobic but...\" garbage. Like no, you are and you're not hiding it as well as you think you are. Trying to come up with reasons to misgender someone and deny them their nonbinary identity is transphobic. Accepting Noelle as a girl based on her appearance and being referred to as she/her but not Kris, Napstablook and Seam being nonbinary because never look at the camera and say they are nonbinary is transphobic. Is it that hard to see someone being referred to as they/them and just respecting that's who they are? Stop trying to fit everybody into unnecessary boxes for your own convenience.",

They got, like, 28 downvotes. Not even any corrections or help, only downvotes. The time before, I explained that it was so hard for me to care because of everyone else being an a hole, and some piece of shit made fun of the fact I had self worth issues. How much of a pathetic excuse for a person do you have to be to be like this.\n\nThe thing is, this is just for Kris.

            "Yeah but remember in other languages there is no way to pronounce people with a non-binary pronoun. Like in German there is no pronounce that could be used for non binary without it being completely grammatically flawed or not ok to say that to a person like the word \u201ees\u201c wich is like \u201eit\u201c in English. So when I talk about Deltarune and Undertale with my friends here in Germany I just gender the characters based on their name. Chara sounds feminine and their relationship with Asriel feels like a brother sister relation so when I speak in German refer to them as a she. When I talk about Kris in German I refer to them as he because their name is a typical boys name and the relationship with Asriel seems like a brother and brother relationship to me. But don\u2019t worry when I talk in English I use they/them but it sometimes happened that I refer them to the pronounces I use    when I talk in german.

It's gross watching mods power trip and enforce theories which have no definitive proof. It's all based upon wishy washy interpretations of a piece of art which hasn't been completed. Who are you to dogpile someone who played the game with Kris in their mind as male or female and now refers to them as \"he\" or \"she\"?\n\nDoes it really get your knickers in that much of a twist that you have to ENFORCE correction of a fictional character's theorised pronouns?

However, this is also a commonly used thing in many other games to \"blank slate\" the character and allow the player to better insert themselves into the story as the mc. I'm aware these games are different. All I'm saying is it's art that gets interpreted different ways by different people, as all art does, and there's nothing wrong with that. There's no need to fight over and it and become obsessed over it.

But, really, the entire theme of Kris's character is that they aren't the player and aren't up for interpretation. Their pronouns are they/them. \n\nPeople misgender Kris as he/him almost 99% of the time they're misgendered, and it's no coincidence. I get it, Kris is a stereotypically male name. But non-binary people can have masculine or feminine traits. You can portray Kris as the most masculine person in the world and yet still have them use they/them. \n\nWe mention transphobia in these discussions, because, well, a lot of the time, it *is* a bit transphobic. It comes from the place of \"Kris is a masculine name and therefore I'll refer to Kris as a dude\" but this is an idea that actual nb people unfortunately have to deal with *all of the time.*",

            "Bruh.",
            "Wait, what? People care *this* much?\n\nLook, I understand that Kris is canonically referred to by *they/them* pronouns, and for the duration of this message I will refer to them with said pronouns. However, why this seems to be such a big deal to people beats me. I've read a few responses below, and I'd like to address a few of the arguments made:\n\nThe point of \"Kris is a character the player controls and is therefore a self-insert\" is very quickly refuted by claims that Kris is a character separate of the player, as is indeed heavily implied throughout DELTARUNE. While it sounds like a compelling refutation, I can't help but disagree. Yes, Kris is separate from the \"player\" entity, but we still *control* them. They are still the vessel we take control of throughout the (so far) first two chapters of the game. It would not surprise me if it turned out that Toby has intentionally made Kris' character and the dialogue surrounding them ambiguous of gender, in order for people to be able to identify to a higher extent with the character they control. After all, identification is to the end of seeing yourself in the character, so it would make sense for Toby to give some space to the player if we're *literally controlling Kris ourselves* most of the time.\n\nKris *could* be non-binary, to be sure, but there is currently insufficient evidence to make either claim. This is very different from claiming things that are blatantly contradicted, like \"Alphys isn't lesbian\" or \"Asgore is a woman\" or whatever (though I really don't care about those either...). So, while Kris is most definitely a separate entity from the player, it is still entirely possible for them to be used as a point of identification.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, Toby Fox never corrected anyone. When people spoke to him, referring to Kris as, say, \"He\", Toby would use *they* instead indeed, but nowhere was anyone corrected. It's once more entirely possible (and, in my estimation, *likely*) that Toby simply indicated his lack of preference toward the actual gender of the character. \n\nWhat, then, about the representation argument? Yes, representation is important, but if you force everybody to say what you're saying, and if you care enough about it to put it into a moderator's message, then *of course* people are going to resist. If anything, be glad that Kris is so frequently interpreted as being non-binary, *that's* representation. If you tell everyone to conform to your speech, you're only going to create friction from both sides. This is a great piece of media that we should all be able to enjoy and share in our own ways, why force your interpretations of it onto others? Better yet, why force anything at all? If I were to claim that Susie were a dude, I would be *wrong,* most obviously, but who cares? It's a **game**.\n\nPeople enjoy said game how they desire to, they make up their own narratives and ideas of what \"Character A\" is like, and their story is their truth. Breaking Bad's creator Vince Gilligan put it beautifully when he said this about a narratively eyebrow-raising moment in his acclaimed piece of art: \n\n*\"I think anyone who has an opinion on it has as valid an opinion as I do. (...) This show is yours, at this point, as much as it is ours, and you own it as much as we do.\"*\n\nIf we go and make a fuss about anything that anybody says, then this fighting will never end. Do we really care that much about how people refer to a *fictional* character in a videogame? Is it worth harassing people over something as minor as this? If I were part of the NB community, I would love for everyone to be able to express their own thoughts and feelings on this game in a manner they feel comfortable with, and I certainly wouldn't want to be represented by a community that gets hostile whenever someone intentionally refrains from referring to a fictional third-party by the pronouns I would like them to. This hostility will only lead to more division, it won't mend anything if you reduce the active community to no more than the subset of those willing to comply. \n\nBigots exist, and people can be pretty darn stubborn indeed. Perhaps many people indeed just don't respect the non-binary community, but that's not what this is about.

            "how does kris being supposed to be a self insert character, but then later be revealed not to be makes them any different from characters that have their own story and up to interpretation?as you said, this fact changes the conception that kris is not us,but their own character who makes them as equal of a character than any other one,with unique personality and everything.that\u2019s what this twists adds to their character.however there are plenty of characters who have their own story, and were not self inserts from the very start, but still have their gender up to interpretation.the difference between them and kris is that kris had this twist, but in the end they both got to be their own character entirely.the thing about gender being up to interpretation does not mean necessarily projecting your own gender in the character.if that was the case then i would agree with you, that way of seeing it is not the right one.up to interpretation, in the way that i mean is that of just deciding for yourself what you think they are with no projection of your own gender whatsoever.seeing it in this way doesn\u2019t go against their character twist and their own story still stands.the use of they/them in the nb meaning does contribute to kris\u2019 character arc and what it means,but it still is just a interpretation with no definitive proof.the other use of they/them as in a gender up to the player to decide is also just a interpretation, one that doesn\u2019t add as much to the twist as the previous interpretation but is just as possible, for the reasons i said before.if you have definitive proof that the first interpretation is absolute and leaves no room for any others,please show me.otherwise, we can\u2019t say for sure which is the one unless toby fox himself says it",
            "absolutely, the best and probably correct theory currently is that nb, but the fact is if it isn't confirmed, hard enforcement is just not the answer to someone just referring to them (kris) incorrectly/differently; i think the best strategy is just wait for the game to make kris's gender [more] obvious and let the real bigots out themselves and get banned",

That's actually the whole reason these types of toys exist: for practicing social skills.\n\nI'm sorry people made you feel uncomfortable.

We make a vessel and then get it discarded and suddenly we\u2019re controlling this completely different person with their own identity.

It can feel validating to a non-binary person to hear people respecting NB pronouns, and it can be disheartening to see people just saying \u201cThey/them is up for interpretation.\u201d It can be the difference between them feeling comfortable in a space, and them feeling ignored and shut out.",

            "Reading the amount of stuff Toby has listed that the team has to do to have a content complete/draft playable version and begin testing for bugs and smoothing out (the steamroller), Toby hopes to have this done by the next newsletter. Which we can expect to be sometime in June at the earliest, August at the latest, since he does a summer newsletter around this time. If the team can have all this done by a few months from now and they are able to keep this pace (maybe continue to speed it up, Toby is very positive about the growing of the team and the great functionality of all the new team members, for all we know they may push past their own expectations), I anticipate that by the start of September, Chapter 4 will be content complete and on its way to be completely smoothed out. After that we would need to wait for translation into Japanese and Chapters 3/4 would be done completely and ready for release. \n\nCould be copium but when you lay it out in a scheduled manner and take in mind they are keeping on track to get to their internal deadline, my personal guess (what I hope for the most) is that everything will be complete by the end of the year. My best case scenario prediction for the release of the chapters will be Christmas 2024, and worst case scenario sometime later next year. I don\u2019t think they will have enough time for all smoothing and translation to be done by Halloween which I have seen people hoping for the most as of now. \n\n\nWe need to keep in mind that there could be bumps in the road that pushes back or slows their progress. My guarantee guess is that Chapters 3 and 4 will release no later than 2025. Keep your fingers crossed for the next progress update sometime in July/August most likely. If Toby announces all of the game\u2019s content is complete and they are playing through the game to fix stuff like he hopes to, I think it will be highly likely we will be seeing the game before New Years. Let\u2019s trust in Toby and the team that they can do their best to give a great new experience for us all.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this, but the overall pace and growing team size with producers and new developers to quicken the schedule only speaks good for our predictions on later chapters progress to be quicker. Even with the factors in the speeding or slowing of Chapter 4\u2019s progress, this is overall a positive for all fans of Deltarune.",

Kinda interesting, makes me wonder that at some point maybe after Toby is finished with DR, he could show us stuff like UT's version of Susie aka \"Suzy\".\n* Finally Asgore and Flowey getting screen time in a Newsletter! Yay!!! Hopefully he finally gets merch next.\n* Asgore cut it in the shape of Toriel and Undyne did it in the shape of Alphys. hee hee. This supports my theory that Toriel and Asgore getting back together is an actual possibility.\n* Fun Papyrus and Flowey interactions!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* I can't believe people are saying \"yeah its coming late 2025\" after this update. Toby literally said:\n\n>It's my hope that the next time I update you, a first pass of the entire Chapter 4 will already be at least halfway crushed by a steamroller\n\n* The impression I get is that their internal deadline is Halloween. There would still be stuff left to do after finishing the videogame part, but i'm guessing we'll get Chs 3&4 in december or maybe november.\n* Ralsei having direct parallels with Flowey, I'm curious what those people who argue that \"ackshually Ralsei has nothing to do with Asriel\" have to say now. Also, Hat Ralsei! I wonder if this means we'll see Hat Ralsei again in the game.\n* I already made a separate comment about it, but Toby's description of \"FALLEN WING\" is exactly how i think Gaster's character will be like. A \"fallen angel\" (666) who lost a \"piece\" of himself, and a parallel to not only Toby himself but creators of games/art in general.\n* Ghost cousins interaction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* After 6 years i hope Toby really meant it when he said he hasn't burnt out making the game.\n\nAbout the Papyrus Interview sequel:\n\n* HOLY CRAPSTER!!!!!!! This is the first time Flowey has interacted with a character that isn't \"us\" on-screen, like, ever. And it's with Papyrus!!! I'm so happy.\n* ...Wouldn't it be fun if the Smash thing was an actual hint that Sans is joining the next Smash game? I think it would be very fun...\n* OFFICIAL MEW MEW DIALOGUE PORTRAIT!!! I love it, mew. Now that I think about it, she's had more presence in these letters than i'd have expected, I wonder if that means something.\n\n>\"BUT THINK ABOUT IT. EVERYTHING YOU EVER WROTE... WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SOME ANNOYING, DIFFICULT TO READ FONT!\"\n\n* ...I couldn't help but think of wingdings.\n* Sans wearing a hat and speaking in cursive reminds me of Lancer putting on a mustache and changing his name to little boy.",

That the things you wanted to achieve are floating away from you in the sky while you lie there, fallen in a crater, your wing torn off, never to grow back. Bitterness grows, and you feel like you may never leave the ground again.\n\n>But\n\n>That's not true.\n\n>You can still fly.\n\n>That's what this song is about.\n\n>Just before the intense part of the song, there's whispering. These are like the magic words that let you do anything. And as long as you say them you cannot lose.\n\n>Even if you lose a piece of yourself, even if it feels like you can't get up anymore, you can. You can fly with one wing. You can fly without any wings.\n\n>So, keep singing.\n\n>Keep singing.\n\nA \"fallen angel\" (666) who lost a \"piece\" of himself, and a parallel to not only Toby himself but creators of games/art in general.\n\nIt's literally so close to my ideas of Gaster that i'm actually doubting them because it's hard to believe Toby would just lay Gaster's entire character like this at us.",
            "That was actually a surprisingly detailed development update. I think Toby learned his lesson after some of the earlier updates were rather vague and misleading. It sounds like Chapter 4 really is the first chapter whose development is going smoothly. Hopefully, with the new producer and other team members, future chapters will go similarly well.\n\nBased on what we were told, it sounds like Chapter 4 should be fully implemented or close to that point by the next Undertale anniversary. However, it's important to keep in mind that there are more things that need to happen to a chapter afterwards before it can really be considered ready for release. Given that Chapter 3 wasn't mentioned at all (for the first time), I think it's safe to assume it has yet to reach that point. So surely, Chapter 4 will also spend a while in that development phase. I think that's the main reason why Toby still thinks it's too early to announce a release date. I'm not sure if it's realistic to hope for it to still be this year, but it should hopefully be close enough to it that we'll at least see it announced before the year is over.\n\nOther than that, the extended Papyrus interview had some pretty funny gags. There's clearly nothing important in it at all this time, so I think by now it's fairly safe to say that we won't be getting any more meaningful information about him and Sans before the time has come for the game to reveal it.\n\nThe paragraph about Fallen Wing was expected, but nice. But the technical side of things doesn't seem to have been set up correctly. Getting a vocal-free version of the song would indeed be cool and unexpected, but the link isn't working. There's also an image that appears to be the product of a failed attempt at embedding the song's YouTube upload in there. That one specifically is a particularly awkward mistake to make because you can't retroactively fix it for the emails, only for the web version.\n\nSo overall, I guess I'm satisfied. We got plenty of development info out of it. Not much else, but that's already good.\n\nEdit: Okay, the link to the MP3 file works now. It's kinda neat, but unfortunately just a small snippet of the song. The full thing would've been far more interesting, so it's unfortunate such a version isn't available for sale. The YouTube video also works in the web version, but obviously not in the emails.",

If I only had this information, I\u2019d still guess a late 2024 release date would still be very much up, right? Maybe November or December, and not October, but still. \n\nBut then he says \u201cthe release is still quite far\u201d which, considering we have already waited over 2 and a half years since the chapter 2 release, can\u2019t mean just a couple of months, right? So form me, that really indicates at least an year\u2019s wait; which would mean around mid-2025, or even late-2025, for the 10th anniversary of Undertale (which I find a bit disheartening, but oh well).\n\nJoining these two peaces of info, I\u2019m currently guessing we\u2019ll get a release date in the next newsletter. And I\u2019m still aiming for a early 2025 release (like, february, after the team comes back from the holidays), and that maybe Toby is just being cautious about his language in order to not get everyone too hopeful about a release he isn\u2019t even 100% sure of.

A predicted Christmas release is most likely as long as the steamrolling phase is announced in September. \n\nOn the other hand, if the content is done by July and they are beginning steamrolling then, our situation would be even better than expected. Though if they exceed their own expectations, I still think they will release on Christmas in order to maximise the time needed for them to smooth, translate, and port. \n\nThis is all in speculation for my best case scenario. If content is still being worked on by September then I think we should anticipate a 2025 release. Most probably earlier in the year, but 2025 nonetheless.

And, at least some of the team will be moved over to Chapter 5!\u201d\n\nTo me, steamrolling is how Toby refers to essentially \u201cflattening out\u201d the content of the game itself, play testing, bug testing, then fixing those bugs and making sure the process is as refined as possible. This is essentially the last step of truly making a game before releasing it to the public, as the game needs to have every bit of content complete in order to go through the whole game from start to finish and observe every little intricacy created in order to fix and revise it. Though for Deltarune it isn\u2019t the last step, as translation into Japanese is then done after the game is done, and then the game must be ported to the Nintendo Switch for release on that platform as well. \n\nFrom what I understand, Toby\u2019s hope is that by the next newsletter, they will have finished all the content (which he has laid out just before the quoted parts above in the newsletter) of Chapter 4, and the first phase of bug testing/play testing, bug fixing and smoothing out is at least halfway complete. Usually multiple phases of play testing will be underway in order to identify various things at different points to have a show of all the variables possible, by essentially pushing the game to break so any players when the game is released try various things out and cannot accomplish it, basically like a clairvoyance of the developers, as they will need to go through with this mindset in order to find every little thing they can.",

I really believe Toby didn't want us to wait more but at the same time I'm convinced he will be trying to deliver the best he can.\n\nIMO I don't believe it will happen this year. It would be absolutely rushed.",
            "No, I live in chile",
            ">It doesn't mean it will go faster. It depends on what work needs to be done and what Toby wants to release as finished product. \n\nSure but I would be surprised if Chapter 34 released at the end of 2025. Seems to late.\n\n>There might be a still work around Chapter 3 (translation takes time) Toby didn't talk about. Also if there is a more amount of lore in Chapter 4 than Chapter 3, translation might take more time and that's a thing Toby has rather limited control over how fast it goes.\n\nToby mentioned that localization is being worked on about three months ago, in the Winter Newsletter. I don't see why he wouldn't do that next time. Of course translation takes time, but Ch4 Japanese localization shouldn't take almost a year more than Ch3 Japanese location. How long translation takes mostly depends on the amount of dialogue, not lore. \n\n>IMO I don't believe it will happen this year.

            "> It would be absolutely rushed.\n\nThat is a very bold claim to make. It would not be rushed at all, and I don't get where people are making this conclusion from.\n\nI expected to hear a much smaller % of the stuff being done in the next news letter. What we got was a report that a large part of the development is almost done. A single event, some cleanup on bullet patterns, and a few map screens? Thats very, very little that needs to be done and then you still have like 3-4 months of cleanup (with more manpower and focus than ever) to just make the end of THIS year.",
