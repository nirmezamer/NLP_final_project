        "content": "Hi, i\u2019m not too sure how to start this, but for context i\u2019m living with my boyfriend in an apartment complex, second floor, and i think someone\u2019s been stalking me or trying to get in. \nSince we\u2019ve moved in i\u2019m usually alone here, my bf works long hours and gets home around sunset, and i\u2019m usually taking care of the house. this is our first place together and it\u2019s been amazing but i feel like i\u2019m paranoid.\ni keep hearing stuff or noticing stuff has been moved, turned on, or shut off, and so has my partner. recently i heard and saw someone trying to pick my lock and get in, but i think they heard me so they ran off.\nit looked like the guy that watched me move in that refused to talk to my dad when he asked what he wanted.\nsame guy was following me around and standing outside my livingroom window listening to me and my bfs conversations.\nbut last night we got home late, locked the door and went to bed after we changed, we heard keys and stuff being moved in the night but we thought it was our neighbors.\nwhen we woke up our tv was completely gone, and a pair of my underwear and keys.\nhow did they get in\nThis is getting so much worse by the day, i\u2019m really scared. My bf is a pretty big guy, 6\u20194 230lbs but i\u2019m 5\u20194 100 pounds flat and 17.\nI changed the locks this morning but i\u2019m still scared. \nwhat do i do?\n\nAs for weapons, this is the best i can do i think\n (https://imgur.com/a/o3SnD0o)\n\nPolice have been contacted, checking the buildings cameras and what not, moving as soon as possible\n\nThanks for all the advice, will be using it, i don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe me or not, safety is my only concern right now\n\nupdate: i think that person just tried to use the keys they took for the door, i ran to the door and just saw them running out of the complex, definitely a man, and i\u2019m not spending another night here.\nme and my bf came back 2 am last night, locked our door, ate and nothing was moved at all, so we went to bed, fan on, door closed, i woke up to the door wide open, front door unlocked, stuff gone, and dirt all over the floor and then called the police.\n\nLeft again today and shut all the lights off and locked the door, left the apartment as it is to go to my parents, came back to grab stuff and the lights were all on and doors were opened but the lock was still locked. i\u2019m so confused \n\nwe\u2019re installing a little trail cam we found at our parents house, hopefully will catch something.\n\nstaying somewhere else for the night, update in the morning.",

Their illness convinces them that some group of people are trying to ruin them and can hack their brains, the police are usually in on it too. One of the more fascinating things I learned was that the first documented case of someone claiming brain hacking was in the 1700s, weird how the delusions have stayed pretty consistent for hundreds of years. There was a study that found that people who \u201cexperienced\u201d gangstalking had much more lasting mental damage than people who had an actual stalker. \n\nThis is not directed at OP, the story here is sus but it doesn\u2019t really have the characteristics of the schizophrenic stuff I\u2019ve seen.

Then I couldn't decide what to eat because all their food sounded weird so when I got to the front of the line and they asked me what I wanted I panicked and just ran away.

My neighbor essentially created a dam with their addition, so now water backs up and floods between our homes and into the back of my yard. Then it has copious standing water for several days when it rains. Thankfully, my home itself is built on slightly higher ground, but sometimes the water rising quickly (been as high as 5-8+ inches deep before with normal rain), makes me incredibly nervous. We bought a cut lot, not built on fill, which is nowhere near a flood zone to avoid water issues.
