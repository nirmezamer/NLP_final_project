Thanks for bringing it back!\n\nRARBG was my favorite even though its not really a site for the list. Great for one stop shopping Games, Movies, TV, Music and XXX so easy to use as everything was so organized for a public site. Sad to see them go. They always had the latest scene releases for games and more importantly they hosted game updates and re-releases etc.\n\nFitGirl is probably my current fav for games but again don't game much nowadays. I just buy the games these days and I down games for demoing. Hate direct download sites give me torrents any day. IGG is good example of why.\n\nStreaming or constant online connection will or is killing P2P games. Hell these days most games are indie or budget titles. AAA's are hard to come by or take a really long time.\n\nXXX no probs with those. Have dozens upon dozens of member and public sites. Games I can always buy. XXX? The wife and kids wouldn't like that. And PRON makes games look dirt cheap ; )",

Identify wich one is the dlc by creating a new character. \n c. leave the dlc saves alone and continue with step 4.\n d. for step six the source file is the ORIGINAL SAVE and destination file is the NEW DLC SAVE.\n e. for step 7 the steam id MUST BE THE NEW ONE, the folder WHERE THE DLC SAVES ARE. very important.\n\n2.COPY the saves to a new folder and delete the from the original.\n\n3. Open elden ring and create new character. \n\n4. INSTALL MODS: elden ring save transfer and save recover. might add links later.\n\n5. OPEN SAVE TRANSFER, Select the save you want to import: THIS IS THE ONE YOU COPIED. (source file)\n\n6. Select the save to where your characters will be copied: THIS IS THE NEW SAVE. Here you also select what characters you'll transfer. then just transfer and finish. (destination file)\n\n7. OPEN SAVE RECOVER: https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/295\n The steam id are the numbers from the folder where your saves are. Remember to run as admin. Select RUN and wait till the program finishes. \n\n8. DONE :D enjoy dlc.",
