        "content": "The bay area is the focus of a lot of political controversy, both for legitimate issues in the area and in comparison to other, politically different areas around the country. The discussions about these issues often attract very strong opinions from users who only come to the subreddit to argue about them. This causes lots of extra work for us moderators, and also draws otherwise rule abiding users into heated arguments. We have decided to address this by restricting such discussions to only established members of the subreddit. We don't want to favor one political viewpoint over any others, so we run a moderation bot that applies the same, unbiased criteria to all posts about politics or crime.\n\nWhen commenting on these posts, the bot will automatically remove your comment without notice if you don't have an established history of commenting or posting in the subreddit. We intentionally aren't stating the exact requirements, or how close individual accounts are to meeting them, but they do require a low, but consistent amount of commenting or posting over a period of several months. If you do comment on one of the posts and your comment is removed, it doesn't count towards your accumulation of history, but there's also no penalty for doing so.\n\nPosting has the same requirements, but also requires that you not have posted a political/crime post in the last week. We also require that all such posts be only a link to a news article or official statement from a reporter or official. No self posts, image or video posts are allowed on these subjects.\n\nThese filters will be automatically applied if the flair of the post is \"Politics & Local Crime\". If you don't meet the requirements for posting and try to get around the filter by posting under a different flair, you can be automatically banned.\n\nThe restrictions do not apply to non-controversial posts under any other flair, so feel free to post and comment on everything else the bay has to offer.\n\n\n\nNew rule changes, flairs and updated styling\n\nHello everyone! We've given the sub a bit of a makeover, here's a summary of the changes.\n\n### New Rules:\n\nWe've rewritten the whole rules list. For the most part this won't result in any enforcement changes, but will hopefully make our rules more clear, give people more detailed report reasons to use and let us moderators give more clear feedback when removing comments and posts. Here are the new rules\n\n1. No poor or hostile behavior\n * No personal attacks or hostile language against your fellow redditors. Hostile language against public figures and organizations is allowed as long as it's not overly egregious.\n2. No racism or other hate speech\n * Do not directly or indirectly suggest someone has done something because of their race. Pointing out other people's racism is allowed as long as it doesn't cross the line of being a personal attack.\n3. No advocating violence\n * Don't suggest or glorify that people should be killed, maimed or shot, either by vigilantes or the legal system. Recommending people legally arm themselves is fine as long as it's not accompanied by any suggestion of wanting to use the weapon against someone.\n4. No duplicate posts\n * If a topic has been posted in the last few days, only posts with substantial new information are allowed.\n5. No advertising\n * Advertising anything that you or anyone associated with you makes money off of is not allowed. Giveaways, fundraisers and bayclub membership posts are not allowed. Pet adoption posts are allowed. Recommending free events or groups is fine. Send us a modmail if you are unsure whether this applies to your case or to ask for an exception.\n6. No unverified or mislabeled crime posts\n * All posts about crime need a news article from a reputable organization or a statement from a state official or police force. They also must be correctly flaired.\n7. No unverified contact information in missing person posts\n * Posts about missing people can only recommend contacting a police department. They can contain the publicly available phone number for the police department, but not any other numbers. Lost pet posts are fine and don't have this restriction.\n8. Posts must be about the bay area\n * Topics that are relevant to the bay but aren't directly in the bay are allowed, such as news about a wildfire blowing smoke through, or people getting trapped on the road to Tahoe. But there must be some relation to the bay area.\n\n### New Flairs:\n\nWe have updated the list of post flairs and also turned on the setting to require post flairs on submission. This will hopefully make the subreddit a bit easier to browser, while also cleaning up enforcement of our enhanced moderation on politics and crime posts. Here are the new flairs\n\n* Politics & Local Crime\n* Events, Activities & Sports\n* Work & Housing\n* Traffic, Trains & Transit\n* Food, Shopping & Services\n* Fluff & Memes\n* Scenes from the Bay\n* Earthquakes, Weather & Disasters\n\nWe're open to adding a couple more flairs if these prove insufficient.\n\n### New Style:\n\nWe've updated the banner image, subreddit icon and style colors as well as a lot of other minor detail settings.\n\nBig thanks to u/MistaKimsta who [took the picture used in the banner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ghf8i5/rolling_hills_of_east_bay/).\n\n### Updated enhanced moderation:\n\nWe set up the enhanced moderation bot a couple years ago and it's proved an invaluable tool for allowing discussion about controversial topics between people who actually use the subreddit, while excluding those who just come here to brigade the sub. There were two notable issues we're addressing with today's changes.\n\nFirst was people not adding the politics or crime flairs to the post, which meant enhanced moderation wasn't turned on till hours later when a mod came around and changed the flair. This should be resolved by requiring flair on all posts now, and automatically banning people who intentionally chose the wrong flair.\n\nSecond was a small subset of people making the majority of the political/crime posts. This will be resolved by restricting such posts to one per week per user.\n\n[You can read more about the details of the enhanced moderation changes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/195xvo5/restrictions_that_apply_to_political_and_crime/).\n\n### Open to feedback:\n\nIt's been a long time since there were any substantial rule or style changes to the sub, so we're very open to feedback about all these changes. And especially the sub icon, banner image and the list of post flairs.\n\nWe hope this makes the subreddit better for everyone!",

As such would it be alright to call said person out including pejorative such as stupid or idiot.\n\n>X groups of people deserve Y negative treatment b/c they are X\n\nA blanket and stereotype statement such as above is obviously wrong b/c there is no way an entire group of people in the hundreds of thousands or more all behaves and believes the same.

So would calling these people personally out be poor behavior\n\n\n[Very crude but relevant quote why some people should be called out.](https://youtu.be/E7Sr-cpFwUc?si=vwjhVUOiZGbOYXz-)\n\n\n\nAs for icon change of the sub, it\u2019s so generic I had no idea it was the Bay Area sub.\n\nWhy not just a picture of the Bay Area map as icon picture?\n\n[This one](https://149725886.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/map_04-20-21_300dpi_27.22x18.13_inv2318c-scaled.jpg)\n\n[This topography looking one](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/c2/5f/22c25f1ca3d529d2dbe80fc8d2eb8c73.jpg)\n\nBridge Icon would make sense too since we have several bridges connecting each bay side",

            "Of all the changes, I\u2019m most relieved about no more Bay Club membership posts. Even though it usually gets posted about a meme, what about the show that shall not be named? They already do so much marketing which is what they\u2019re known for and here, made fun of for, but sometimes the excessive posts feels like free publicity for a shitty org. \n\nEDIT: there are many informative comments on these posts denouncing the org and show but \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d A limit on these types of posts could be useful.",

It's been getting really sad and not at all like the actual bay around here.\n\nEDIT: My only feedback is the flair titles feel excessively long. Some are longer than the actual post titles. Would you consider shortening them in the future once they've become more established?",
            "*\"...but they do require a low, but consistent amount of commenting or posting over a period of several months.\"*\n\nI'm skeptical of this rule. My guess is there are a lot of people on Reddit and this sub who don't comment much and rarely or never post on the \"controversial\" topics (politics, crime), and from my perspective that's good. \n\nPeople should comment when they feel they have something to say, or are excited, appalled, strongly supportive or strongly opposed, or surprised by an issue or a post. \n\nThey shouldn't feel forced to comment regularly just to maintain access / status. \n\nIf someone comments that they don't comment much or at all, but a particular post moved them in some way to respond--that's actually better, in my view, than someone who comments on anything and everything (and I write that as someone who can comment a LOT on particular days). \n\nI don't feel having a history of regular commenting or posting should be a gateway requirement to having your voice heard when a controversial topic comes up. \n\nI understand your goal--not to be submerged by 'outsiders' rushing in to debate a controversial topic--but I think it might have the unintended effect of reducing the echo chamber to exclusive blathering by a subset of people who comment all the time--and maybe *too* much. \n\nI do support having a subscription to r/BayArea to comment on certain types of controversial posts. \n\nYour thoughts, moderators?",
            "\\+1 for the updated flairs and absolutely appreciate your moderation efforts! When I first saw the new icon, I thought I was in the wrong place \u2014 but it definitely helped flag the fact that new updates were put into place. Thanks for the explanation.",
            "I wish you all the luck in the world with this. Back when I was a mod here (for about six months), the constant hostility and fighting was a constant psychological drain, and it eventually made it impossible for me to do the job. I hope you are able to combat and contain the monster that I could not.",
            "I think this is good. The only thing I notice on some forums is that people seem to be able to get away with innuendo or sarcasm that strongly implies a personal attack, but then directly calling it out might get you flagged. IMO the innuendo is just as toxic if not moreso. Just something to consider.",

That is a small but crucial difference.\n\nIf you want to go around saying some sort of general negative observation such as like I don't know, people who don't pick up after their dogs are selfish and obnoxious, go right ahead but please try to be polite despite the fact that people who don't pick up after their dogs (for example) are not in any way polite.",

            "Yes those are gone. They just weren't getting any activity. We might replace them with something else, but we'll give it a bit before deciding.\n\nThat's good feedback. I did that in the hope it would make it more obvious there was something special about them so people would read the stickied comment before having their own comments removed. But like you said it's a bit ugly. I'll think about removing it.",
            "There are a handful of users who post most of the crime posts in the sub and this change was directly targeted at them. Now they can only post those once a week and there's already been at least one thread automatically removed. So it does seem to be working.",

            "I would love to just have broad categories and make the names shorter instead of putting a bunch of names on end. But honestly this is the best I could come up with while still making it obvious what goes where. And it's still not really enough, I've realized that complaints about PGE don't cleanly fit in any existing flair.\n\nIf you have any specific suggestions for shortening things I'd love to hear them.",
            "Our general view is that if you aren't willing to contribute regularly to the sub outside political posts then you aren't allowed to participate inside them. Regardless of your intent.\n\nWe just don't want people who are only interested in commenting on political posts and nothing else.\n\nIt really is a very low threshold and the only important thing is that your history is spread out over a fairly long timeframe. I've had many, many people complain about it in the two years the bot has been running and there has not been a single case of a legitimate user being accidentally caught by it.",
            "This is valid criticism. We'll give it a bit to see how people feel and consider either softening the colors or even just making them all the same color.",
            "The primary intent of the rule is to not make it the mods responsibility to figure out if a specific event actually happened in the bay, and recently. If it's just a random twitter account with a video we can't know for sure so we'll remove it. But if it's a reporter or something, like Dion Lim, then we know at least she's not lying about it happening and we'll allow it.",
            "Insulting people falls under rule 1, \"No poor or hostile behavior\".

Are thefts going up?\"*  \n\n(My catalytic converter was actually stolen this way last year, although I didn't post about it.)\n\nWould that post be automatically be taken down because: (a) it includes an image? (b) It doesn't cite a news article or a police advisory about recent catalytic converter thefts in my community or the Bay Area? (c) instead of just 'reporting' the crime I posit a possibility / question about rising crime rates rather than citing a statistical source?\n\nI suspect no one--including the moderators, and me--wants the sub to be overrun with NextDoor-type posts of *\"I saw this and I think it's suspicious...\"* \n\nBut does posting about \"grassroots\" first hand crime experiences that might reflect a trend trespass on the rules?",
            "Thank you! That makes sense.  \nOn my part, I personally try to double check to see if the video or picture is legitimate and actually happened in the Bay Area. \n\nIt's important that we allow legitimate posts from social media because these days many news orgs get their news directly from X or, from X then it gets posted here on Reddit and if it goes \"viral\", then they talk about it.",

I\u2019ll wait til it\u2019s safe to get back in the left lane then. Other cars are passing left now. Aaand you\u2019re now weaving around, passing on the right.

I\u2019ll just signal to get back in the left lane once it\u2019s\u2026well I\u2019m going to wait while that jeep swerves across 4 lanes to the off-ramp, why didn\u2019t you start getting over like a mile ago? K cool, now I\u2019m in the left lane, looks like there\u2019s some traffic, huh no we\u2019re just all going like 60 now because there\u2019s a Prius with it\u2019s lights off 3 cars ahead going that slow. It\u2019s 9pm and raining, turn your lights on. And speed up or merge right! Everyone to our right is going faster than us! Shit I\u2019ll merge to the right so I can pass GODDAMN WERE YOU IN MY BLINDSPOT THIS WHOLE TIME?? How did I not see your huge lifted truck with your \u201cblue lives matter\u201d flag? I\u2019d honk but you\u2019re probably buzzed and packing heat.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, here in the Bay, people are driving fast, but there\u2019s some order. The left lanes are faster, if you wanna drive the speed limit you generally are in the 2 right lanes. There will always be maniacs who weave on the highway, but here they tend to stay in the left 2 lanes, or maybe even signal when they\u2019re about to pass you!\u00a0",

Sure it happens here, but far less than most of the rest of the country.\n\nDrivers are generally assertive here, but at least consistently so. I can anticipate that all the other drivers will be assertive/aggressive and drive accordingly. \n\nBaltimore is a shit show. CO between Denver and Colorado Springs is Mad Max mayhem. Washington state is passive, oblivious, and takes special pride in driving side by side across all lanes of the freeway going exactly the same speed. Most of the Midwest can\u2019t merge for shit, camps in the left lane, and takes personal offense to being passed. NJ/NY are\u2026well their own hellscape.

There are a few places in the Bay Area that feel like this, but it\u2019s not everywhere. Driving in Miami or Ft. Lauderdale in January has been downright scary, and is reflected in them having some of the highest insurance rates in the country. \n\nSure some Bay Area roads are very congested, but are relatively chill compared to other places I\u2019ve lived and visited.",

And because of the number exits taking up lane 1 and big rigs in lane 2, lane 1 has turned into the speeding lane while the left lane gets backed up.

Before high school, some of the kids I knew were somewhat worse off, and others were somewhat better off than most, but we generally all fell into the same lower-middle- or middle-middle-class milieu. So high school was a revelation. Status distinctions that had been entirely obscure to me came into focus. Everything about you\u2014the clothes you wore, the music you listened to, the way you pronounced things\u2014turned out to be a clear marker of where you were from and whether you were worth knowing.\"\n\n[The upper middle class is ruining all that is great about America.

For a bit, I tried instead, I went to a large state school as a child prodigy and because that makes me fascinating, I have friends in high places.

And besides that, even within tech there's plenty of folks with lower paying jobs who do not live in Los Altos or Atherton, went to local schools, can only rent east of 101 and shop at Costco.\n\nFunny thing, most of our friends are coincidentally from the midwest, the low-key, unpretentious hardworking type, I guess we pretty much found our niche.

It's one of those safe topics people talk about if you have nothing else to talk about but if you are more substantive, then it's not hard to just continue a conversation thread about other things.\n\nI don't know how to easily break out of this but you might want to look into more hobby based activities. Hiking groups, photography groups, etc. I know there's always going to be a big tech circle in all those popular hobbies, but there's a lot of people who aren't tech overachievers too. Try to force yourself out of your comfort zone and talk to those folks instead.",

            "You bring up a really fascinating point that this book I\u2019m reading called *Psychopolitics* by Byung-Chul Han is actually about.\n\nIn most of rest of the world, you are subconsciously taught that certain job opportunities, life experiences, and self-improvement \"won\u2019t happen to you.\" For example, you will never become a part of the royal family, prime minister, etc. You will most likely be in the same economic class as you were born, so you may as well do what you need and be good at it too. \n\nWhat we mention above being taught in other countries, is what Byung calls \u2018negative power.\u2019 When the ruling and aristocracy tell the working people, \"No, you can\u2019t do this,\" \"No, you can\u2019t do that,\" that is them asserting negative power.\n\nHowever, very, very recently in history, corporations especially have realized they don\u2019t need to actively force their workers to work harder. In fact, these corporations can convince people to want to force themselves to work harder by what Byung calls positive power.\n\nThis \u2018Hustle Culture\u2019 you see and hear about, this strong sense of self-centered individualism, and loss of community can be partly, if not mostly, blamed on positive power.\n\nPositive power works by corporations telling individuals something like this:\n\n\"You CAN be anything you want. You can be a millionaire, you can be the CEO of any company, you can own all these fun toys, you can go party in Dubai, you can even be \u2018old money\u2019 just like me! BUT you have to work as hard as you can to always be a better version of yourself than you were yesterday. So what do you say? Do you wanna be a millionaire/billionaire and CEO with all these fun toys like ME, or do you want to be some loser who is happy with what they have in their \u2018mediocre\u2019 life and who focuses on their inner well-being and personal relationships with the people around them?\"\n\nSo how this works is that they, the corporation, can no longer be labeled as \u2018the bad guy\u2019 because they\u2019re hyping you up! They\u2019re no longer limiting you; instead, they tell you that YOU are limiting yourself if you\u2019re not pushing yourself to be a more productive worker than you were yesterday. They\u2019ll say, \"If you\u2019re not a millionaire, you\u2019re just not working hard enough nor being smart enough with your money.\"\n\nBecause of this, we focus so hard on ourselves because we\u2019re told we can, and if we aren\u2019t, we\u2019re settling for mediocrity. When in reality, upward economic mobility may happen to a few, but in the end, we burn out, which can last years, and we ultimately just stay in the same social class. Along the way, since we\u2019re so focused on getting ahead of everyone else, we also isolate ourselves from our neighbors, our communities, and we lose touch with who we are and our role outside of ourselves\u2014all of which have long-term societal consequences.",

You can be brain-dead idiot but having Harvard puts you in the club and gives you that douchebag arrogance. Unfortunately, it turns out that often takes people further than raw intelligence.  In fact, passed the junior levels, the raw engineering skills rapidly diminish in value.",

If you look around social cliques, it's not surprising software engineers hang out with other tech folk. Car people hang out with car people. Maybe what OP needs to do instead is look for hobby based groups instead of building friends from tech circles only. That might help, but just arguing that OP isn't normal isn't productive either when a large chunk of our economy and jobs are tech jobs.\n\nIf the discussion is just \"I'm normal but the tech people aren't,\" I don't see how that really answers anything except to sound elitist by excluding groups of people.",

Backup camera--again I'm fully capable of backing up and parallel parking on my own but having a car with and without the backup camera makes me appreciate the benefit even more.\n\n3. Safety: Most cars are better designed than ever with more airbags standard than even the most fully loaded car in 2002. Side airbags are standard now, rear airbags are becoming popular, etc.\n\n4. Automation features like even TACC are a huge help in longer drives and reduce fatigue significantly. Lane keeping where it's close to auto steering are actually super helpful on road trips provided you use them properly--be attentive like you're driving, but it reduces so much stress.\n\n5. Infotainment systems whether its Android Auto or Carplay to allow not only safer navigation but also higher quality entertainment.\n\nI get the /r/personalfinance view of driving a Corolla forever, but I do think most people moving to the Bay Area for work can at least afford a new car every 7-10 years and appreciate some of the new features. Again maybe the price isn't for everyone, but I truly do think the new features are significant.",

In today's economic climate, where the costs of living are already high, hidden fees further strain consumers and reduce overall satisfaction. This decrease in customer satisfaction often leads to reduced tipping, directly impacting the hardworking individuals in the service industry. These hidden charges ultimately harm working-class people who rely on tips to make ends meet.In a free market, transparency is crucial. Consumers should always have access to clear and honest pricing to make informed decisions based on their budgets. Deceptive practices undermine this principle and erode trust between businesses and their patrons.I urge you to consider the negative impact this bill could have on both consumers and workers and to vote against SB 1524.

And there\u2019s apparently nothing on the horizon for utilities that are burning the state down and making us pay for the cost by [raising rates 100% in 10 years](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/national-investigations/pge-rate-hike-california/3302833/)\n\nI think housing will ultimately be the issue that flip flops the state if it happens. California is building many houses but none of the new construction will have any impact on prices. That\u2019s the one that people will lose it over and actually change their vote.",
            "The current elected Democrat leaders for sure need a wake up call. The CA voters have been taken for a ride for quite too long. Come November is where voters should come out in huge numbers during primaries as well.",
            "Same. Fuck these guys",
            "I think it was 11-0? The committee is 11, at least. Five of them self-identify as progressive by virtue of membership on the Assembly's Progressive Legislature Caucus: Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, Isaac Bryan, Liz Ortega, Christopher M. Ward, Buffy Wicks. \n\nMy point was not do a No True Scotsman or purity test but to say the people I saw continuing to want it in office were progressives and asked if they saw others of different political philosophies pushing for it. \n\nIf one were to purity test, I don't know that all of them would pass. None of them are my rep, so I don't know a ton about them. CA's most recent push for a state-wide singlepayer system seems to have stalled out primary because Buffy Wicks, as Chair of the Assembly Standing Committee on Appropriations didn't bring it to a vote. Which is especially odd, as API for CalCare points out in their [plea to Assemblymember Wicks](https://apiforcalcare.com/letter-to-asm-appropriations/), it \"is a policy-framework-only bill, it has zero fiscal impact on the state budget.\" So like, she calls herself a progressive. Do others still consider you that when you're out there slaying single payer healthcare? Idkidk",
            "I\u2019ve been to Quince twice back in 2016ish. Dont recall this being there but @ 28% I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in that shithole. Place ain\u2019t cheap - but 28% would make me homicidal on their staff. Fuck them",
            "to be fair, for most high end restaurants, you are only expected to pay the service charge. Tips on top of it would be accepted but are not expected",
            "I\u2019m a sociopath for pointing things out ? Ok lol hey you voted and worship these politicians I guess you are at fault as well. Vote better next time.",
            "If people could \u201cbe better\u201d we wouldn\u2019t need laws.",
            "It only passed committee",
            "Yeah I\u2019m sure you can. I\u2019m just saying for most people they probably wouldn\u2019t want to go down this route and burn so many hours.\n\nFor me, I\u2019ll make a good faith effort to avoid surcharged restaurants, and I\u2019ll ask for it to be removed. If they do not, I won\u2019t leave a tip.",
            "No? Newsom, Pelosi, and other California progressive politicians are struggling for cash?",
            "What? \n\nLet's take a look at our progressive co-sponsor, Mr. Wiener. \n\nhttps://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=32203683&default=candidate\n\n$5.8 MILLION dollars in donations. I mean, it may not be \"a lot of money\" to you, but for a typical progressive voter it very much is.",
            "No, you're the one arguing restaurants shouldn't face consequences including lower sales because they're merely doing what the law allows. As though they have no agency and neither do consumers disgusted by their practices.\n\nAnd for some reason you're putting everything on the shoulders of politicians instead, as though it's their job to intervene in every situation instead of anyone else in that situation acting according to their lights.\n\nWhat kind of weird politics do you espouse where it's the government's job to prevent or allow every little thing by law, and the only choice citizens can exercise on their own is to vote for politicians?",
            "Who decides?",
            "They're not progressive. They're old school liberals.",

The original goalpost was \"progressives make plenty of dough\". \n\nKatie: [$24M in donations](https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=44044441) while crying about \"old white men\" like they were the ones who voted for Schiff instead. \n\nBernie, do you even need to ask?
