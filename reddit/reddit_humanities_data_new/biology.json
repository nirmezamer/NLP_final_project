            "Imagine a giant comes by, cuts your legs off and then observes you crawl home",
            "Me: Smashes and flicks ants unapologetically when they\u2019re near my food.\n\nMe when I hear they put stilts on ants: *Gasp (poor ants)",
            "Wait so how does this work exactly?   \nIf they can find their home based on the sand mounds why would they miss is with different leg length?",
            "The ants with the different leg lengths look really funny",
            "Can I have the guys social media please \n..?",
            "Ants with stilts while standing next to the amputated ants.   * WE ARE THE CHOSE. ONES , THE GIANT HAS CHOSE. US *\nWalks past home.   Ah shit !!!",
            "Put them in a controlled area, have a moving slab or some object for them to walk on and move it forward/backwards to find out if they count steps? How ants came up with a numerical system is beyond me (just going for counting maybe it's meant different), I'd go for sunlight manipulation and try to find out if they use that for moving for a duration and in what direction. Maybe they use their antannae (too?), they are pretty much highly developed micro robots or biological tech we are still learning about.",
            "So all I have to do to keeps ants out of my kitchen is cut a tiny bit off each of their legs so they undershoot the entrance and get lost?\n\nGame changer.",
            "This seems like a study that didn\u2019t need to happen because we should have gotten there through common sense.",
            "Sounds unethical",
            "Howd they put the stilts in the first place?",
            "That's the hypothesis yes. A lot of animals (humans included!) count their steps to know how far they've walked. Seeing a few landmarks and knowing how long you've walked gives you a pretty accurate navigation scheme.\n\n\n\n\nSo if their legs are longer or shorter they'll end up not walking far enough or walking too far past their destination if they take the number of steps they'd need with normal legs.",
            "Because the hypothesis is this particular species relied on counting steps and remembering landmarks to find their way home. So by changing the length of their legs, they can make the ants miss the mark as they count the number of steps they have taken on the way out to get back.",
            "Their distance vision is pretty crap.  This is basically universal to tiny eyes (jumping spider being a major exception).\n\nThey travel farther than they can see the towers from, so they have to get back to where they can see it by counting steps.",
            "Thanks",
            "Uh huh? How would common sense tell you whether it's step counting, scent marking, audio cues, or a myriad of other possibilities",
            "That's not how science works",
            "idk the confirmation of ants counting their steps is pretty cool",
            "The scientific method requires proof of ones theory or hypothesis. Not just an educated guess we hope is right.",
            "Maybe but tbh I wouldn't be able to intuit that ants count their steps to navigate, and I'm not sure how someone else would",
            "We learn common sense.. so how would that work? if we never learn anything we wouldnt have any common sense.",
            "I\u2019m gonna bite them",
            "biblical even",
            "Very carefully",
            "so basically the step counting isnt accurate enough, and they need the mounds to hone in the final stretch. got it",
            "Yeah, by what i know, your senses tell you that the earth doesn't move, so we should all switch to flat earth because it's \"common sense\"?",
            "You don\u2019t know? *scoffs* It\u2019s common sense! Even a baby can do it",
            "Pick up 10 ants. Take 5 of them 20 paces away from the nest, take 5 of them 20 paces towards it. \n\nSeems easier and less cruel than amputating half of them",
            "This made me laugh so damn loud. Thank you",
            "Also because most ants don't have good eyesight as they rely more on vibration and smell to find the way, they wouldn't be able to find the entrance of the nest without the mounds. And the reason why scientists think they rely on counting steps and landmarks is because these are desert ants, if they rely on the scent trails like other ants, it would be unreliable because the high temperature and sunlight will make the trails degrade too quickly."

            "There are other reasons that can explain this.\n\nIn my area, during spring to autumn, ALL snails climb poles when weather gets dry after raining, and hybernate there until next rain. This way they escape certain beetles that prey on them in the ground, and they expect those poles to be leafy trees, more humid and fresh than in open ground. Later in winter, snails will hybernate under the dirt and away from the cold.\n\nBut the poles they are expecting to climb are trees and bushes. Climbing to metallic poles or dead trees is a bug in their programming, because those get too hot under the sun and can make them dry and die.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/snails/comments/qc232j/snails\\_consistently\\_climb\\_these\\_posts\\_then\\_dry\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/snails/comments/qc232j/snails_consistently_climb_these_posts_then_dry_up/)",

            "Purine/Pyrimidine bases are chemically stable and possess planar, aromatic structures. This planarity allows them to stack efficiently within the double-helix structure of DNA, which contributes significantly to the molecule's overall stability. The specific arrangement of atoms in pyrimidines and purines promotes the precise hydrogen bonding between complementary bases, which is obviously useful when you are encoding information molecularly.\n\nFrom a prebiotic chemistry perspective, studies suggest that purines and pyrimidines could form readily under early Earth conditions. Experiments simulating these conditions have shown that these nucleobases can be synthesized from simple molecules like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. The chemical pathways leading to their formation involve relatively straightforward reactions, making them more likely to accumulate in the prebiotic environment.\n\nBiologically, the specific hydrogen-bonding patterns allow for reliable molecular recognition for the accurate replication of genetic material. The hydrogen bonding between purines and pyrimidines also contributes to a stable double-helix structure, which can tolerate minor changes without catastrophic consequences. Also, these bases absorb some ultraviolet light, offering protection against the UV radiation on early Earth.\n\nOver time, the chemical properties of purines and pyrimidines likely led to their selection and enrichment in the primordial soup. Their stability, ability to form hydrogen bonds, and participation in critical biological processes would have made them favorable for early life forms. Also, these bases are multifunctional, not only as building blocks of DNA and RNA but also in cellular metabolism (e.g., ATP, GTP et cetera), which may have contributed to their evolutionary selection.",
            "Outstanding reply!",
            "I have heard that there are alternative molecules to purines and pyrimidines. But the explanation above is just about right. Hydrogen bonding, flat structure, easy to form under prebiotic conditions. Hydrogen bonding is essential for molecule reproduction. They have to have been chosen for ATP and RNA etc. before the DNA double helix appeared."

This phenomenon is considered to be Parasitism - Brood Parasitism. But in this case, the cuckoo is not depending on the crow for nutritional needs.\n\nIf looked upon from a survival aspect, they're both on the same page because as a species their survival is dependent on the 'host' (human and crow).

A parasitism itself is broad term with many definitions, apart from the obvious parasites like fleas or tapeworms there\u2019s parasitic plants, facultative parasites, parasitoids or, as you have mentioned, brood parasitism. Cuckoos are considered parasites, because they \u201csteal\u201d resources from other organism (i. e. another bird). Mosquitos are considered micropredators, because they do not kill their host/prey. Both of these interactions can be described as parasitism, because they meet the definition of parasitism, i.e. taking advantage of another species and causing it harm in the process.",
            "I think a better question is why are you not counting mosquitoes as a parasite. Remember parasitism is the relationship between the two, specifically it is where one benefits and one is harmed. If the host wasn\u2019t harmed it would be commensalism, and if both benefit that is mutualism.\n\n\u00a0Cost can be a lot of things. It can also be behavioral like brood parasitism. But blood is a cost. Time and energy spent raising another species is cost. And the parasite gains from it",
