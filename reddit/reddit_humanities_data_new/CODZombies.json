            "You can see a zombie drop green salvage on the stairs scene right before the cannon shots",
            "It looks so good. I\u2019m a huge defender of Cold War Zombies but I can\u2019t defend the lack of support round-based zombies received.\n\nSo the fact that they have two maps on release and repeatedly said throughout the COD Showcase that this is, \u201cThe triumphant return of **round-based** zombies\u201d has me hopeful that Outbreak is a thing of the past and their full focus is back on round-based maps.",
            "COLD WAR 2 LETSSS GOOOO.\n\nAnd the set crew w/ gobble gums is the icing.\n\nSalvage is confirmed, and you can see it if you click through the trailer.\n\nOne thing I hope is that they tone down the amount of radio chatter, or atleast let us turn it off.",
            "I get the feeling this may be a return to BO3 style gameplay, most likely with some new additions. It makes me wonder how BO3 it\u2019s going to feel, but it is smart having a set crew. The amount of times they mention round-based makes me wonder what will happen to outbreak (never played it but I know it was highly popular amongst casual fans of zombies).",
            "sounds like Milo was pretty on point with his \u201cI found tranzit\u201d video given that one of the launch maps is Liberty Falls & (possibly over analyzing this) they mention how important the \u201clegacy of zombies\u201d is in the direct",
            "Looks to be a mix of Cold War elements with BO3 gameplay. I think this could be the perfect middle ground.",
            "plate direful squeal spark sleep marble drab practice melodic far-flung\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*",
            "That round change music though, looks pretty nice, as opposed to many here, I actually really loved Cold War Zombie and I hope the mechanics are similar to it.",
            "I\u2019m genuinely hyped, they seem to be combining elements from Cold War and BO3 and I\u2019m all here for it. Everything we\u2019ve seen/heard so far is sounding really promising. I can\u2019t wait for more details!",
            "![gif](giphy|2QpH5Khv9ooec)",
            "I was really hoping for a return to WAW-BO2 and maybe BO3 Not BO3 & Cold War",
            "Why do we only get 20 seconds but they spent 10-15 MINUTES talking about campaign and multiplayer \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "Kinda sounds like Zns round change music",
            "This looks awesome",
            "Holy shit quality",
            "Oh this looks GOOD.",
            "Honestly, I am cautiously optimistic this time. Round based zombies with a set-crew is all I wanted",
            "offline solo confirmed or unplayable again?",
            "I honestly want themed maps back. In BO2 & 3 and also 4 every map had a very distinct theme. Everything after that felt so similar.",
            "We are so back Cold War bros",
            "Them saying zombies is the biggest its ever been is so fucking cap its crazy",
            "I cried when salvage drop pop out. And in gonna go 0 1 if i see mimic or other shit. No preorders.",
            "Cold War 2: Aetherium Boogaloo?  All right, I'm down with that.",
            "the map looks so big, reminds me of that one bo1 custom map very slightly, battery i think it is",
            "![gif](giphy|yQodNVIbIKrEKRUyGE|downsized)",
            "On the zoom out from the crew shot, you can see what\u2019s likely the Jug machine or a gobble gum machine to the character\u2019s front left",
            "I'll take it over what we have now. I'm not big on the point out the objectives with a big sign for most of it but I'll live. Origins style where it tells you but doesn't point it out isn't a bad way to go but at least it's going to be round based again. I am, by no means, saying we should go back all the way to the original style either. It's dead and gone let it be.  Fingers crossed though we don't get burned and left as a side project of multiplayer/warzone again. No not pessimistic, just optimistically cautious.",
            "If I can't play as my king Beck, there's no point :(",
            "Holy shit it\u2019s peak\u00a0",

            "Bo3 solos \ud83e\udd71",
            "Cool map and weapons sadly this cast looks extremely weak compared to pretty much all the other groups that have been in zombies",
            "Very reminiscent of BO3 but with a new twist",
            "W",
            "What is salvage?",
            "Not excited about that coming back tbh, finding and building shield adds that additional layer of map specific ideas/mechanics, also i personally just feel like the salvage system makes the game boring",
            "Yeah tbh I didn\u2019t mind Cold War zombies gameplay at all, in fact I thought die maschine was a great time and a pretty well designed map. I just think the missing link is the characters having more personality (hopefully better in this iteration) and the focus being on making unique round based experiences and maps with identity.",
            "I WANT Outbreak or similar, I dig the semi open-world thing.",
            "Outbreak SHOULD come back but it should not replace a seasonal RB map. Outbreak was fun, the issue was it just limited us from getting an additional RB map back in 2021",
            "What are you talking about!? Outbreak was one of the best parts about it for alot of ppl! It\u2019s the essence of round-based playing, isn\u2019t it!?",
            "No interest in just round based. If it\u2019s only round based that sounds like a huge step back.",
            ">Cold War 2 letsss goooo\n\nWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy at least.\n\n> set crew w/gobble gums is the icing\n\nFor me this is the cake. I\u2019m extremely happy to hear this. I just hope the map has as much character as our crew.\n\n>salvage confirmed\n\nI\u2019m not bothered by this, not over the moon either\n\n>tone down the radio chatter\n\nAgreed. Hopefully there is no radio chatter and just the crew talking to each other.",
            "The return of p2w mtx is the icing wut?",
            "How do you know it\u2019s a set crew?",
            "Yikes. I hate to be that guy\u2026 but this might be disappointing if that\u2019s the case",
            "I am very curious I would be very very surprised if they is no outbreak style mode honestly. With the player base there is",
            "I think them constantly mentioning round based was kind of a sneak diss and also way to calm down people complaining about there being no round based zombies in mwz, and thinking we\u2019ll never see it again.  They said they went thru a lot of community feedback lmfao and you see a lot of people saying we\u2019ll never see good zombies again.",
            "I honestly feel like it might be a mix between Cold War and BO3. If that's the case we could be in for the best zombies game to date imo.\n\n\nWith Outbreak they might do it again or maybe they'll just do Outbreak-like modes in Modern Warfare games from now on, like MWZ.",
            "Yeah I agree. We will obviously have to wait and see but I'm extremely optimistic.",
            "Are starting loadouts confirmed to be returning? Would be pretty cool if they returned to pistol",
            "Yeah I really liked Cold War. It wasn't perfect but it was still super fun. Hopefully this is just a more refined version, taking what did work and leaving what didn't.",
            "Sadly zombies normally gets less marketing, even during the BO3 days.",
            "Apparently you always have to have an internet connection which is annoying. Maybe it'll change but who knows.",
            "I think the only map that felt truly unique was Mauer, being set in Berlin after the war fell. Other than that I definitely agree with you.",
            "They probably know the numbers and know how many people play it better than any of us do",
            "To be fair, the more casualized zombies most likely has brought in many more people to the mode. Even if it\u2019s not what the hardcore zombies fans want.",
            "Is salvage a hated system on here?",
            "They can give you different buffs.\n\nSome last for a certain time duration, or number of rounds or certain usages.\nOne of the OP ones from bo3 was one called perkaholic, gave you all perks on the map\n\nVery fun and powerful but not necessary at all",
            "It\u2019s basically sanctioned cheating.",
            "You should really play BO3 zombies.\u00a0",
            "Basically just a variety of different powerups. The BO3 system had them seperated by tiers, with the lowest tier (classic) providing some basic buffs like shooting while sprinting, while the highest tier (ultra mega rare) did some crazy stuff like giving you all the perks in the map immediately.",
            "How can you tell that from a teaser?",
            "Strong Origins vibes \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",
            "In cold war you would use it to craft different items in-game",
            "I was wondering the same thing, so why on earth would salvage be a bad thing?!",
            "I would really love it if they just did some sort of port over of the CW Outbreak mode, not even as a full zombies DLC (keep those drops round based), but just as extra. What\u2019s the harm?",
            "No",
            "Totally agree w you! Outbreak was fun and i hope it comes back to be more fun than ever",
            "I just know that peck is going to yap and yap and yap on the Zets lookalike.",
            "Yeah, the existence of gobblegums kills it for me.",
            "As someone who loved that system. yes.\n\nI understand that you're not as big of a fan of the consumer unfriendly P2W gums, and that's fair. Gobblegums destroyed public lobbies, made Easter Eggs easier, and reduced difficulty to the point of invincibility.\n\nThese are compromises I can make, but you cannot and it's perfectly valid.",
            "Treyarch announced it in a tweet.",
            "I would say that it's fair to wait and see. \n\nCold Wars systems aren't really popular around here, but they never got the chance to be as refined as lecacy zombies.\n\nMaybe this is the game where it starts to click, maybe this is the game where we start to see points on zombie hit again.",
            "Nah I love to be that guy give them harsh criticism we need to go back to og zombies not this salvage bs",
            "As far as I remember, they said in the article that new maps and \u201cexperiences\u201d will be released for Zombies after launch. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make an Outbreak mode, just not at launch. Cold War did the same after all.",
            "Only 2% of the playerbase got the landmark exfill achievment in mw3 thats pretty small playerbase to miss out on completing 1 half hour game session.",
            "Its most definitely CW with flavors of BO3. They are the two most popular editions of zombies (I don't believe anything SHG said about MWZ).",
            "judicious drunk upbeat plucky wine worthless wistful existence aback march\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*",
            "Numbers will just be inflated by multiplayer players and camo grinders anyway",
            "This just reminds me of that tweet from a dev saying \"we cooking this season\" then proceeded to add barely anything to the mode",
            "Not a bad system at all but not that well balanced imo. It feels like collecting salvage every game is the main and too important goal. That makes gameplay too tedious for me. On other side it works great in outbreak.",
            "We went from Dempsey Nikolai Takeo and Richthofen to cod zombies and the adventures of the diversity\u2019s hires",
            "Don\u2019t ever compare origins to this crap. GTFO of this sub",
            "Thanks!",
            "As soon as they start focusing on another mode the other modes slip. They lost interest of all OG Zombie players with outbreak. Anyone who's been a long time fan of call of duty zombies wants round based back.",
            "Hopefully, he was best part of CW",
            "If you want og zombies go play og zombies. It's not going anywhere. Bo3 custom zombies has new maps every week. Things will change and evolve. If you don't like that then just stick with the past",
            "Salvage could literally work and be cool without disrupting existing gameplay too much on Bo1-3 zombies",
            "I\u2019m trying to be nice so they actually listen. Trust me I\u2019ve get lots of downvotes for speaking the truth because I hit a certain nerve of theirs. It\u2019s really frustrating",
            "That was peak. They truly cooked with the one warlord they added lmao",
            "Diversity hires? Previous crews were \u201cdiverse\u201d.",
            "You should get out of this sub",
            "I can smell this comment lmfao. Go touch grass",
            "Brother you can\u2019t even remember how zombies reveals work you were still in diapers when origins came out",
            "Origins is one of the GoaTs but we can shit on the new stuff before it's out!",
            "Shut up gooch lips",
            "You are welcome",
            "If you think I don\u2019t also want round based back you didn\u2019t read what I wrote. What evidence is there that adding an outbreak mode to a game limits round-based maps, what if it assured more future zombies content through boosted popularity?",
            "I wouldn\u2019t mind it if we were talking to him face to face",
            "In what way was cold war really an \"evolution\" it was much more of a devolving of the game mode as a whole. It just took stuff from warzone and put it in the game while ruining several core mechanics.",
            "Oh fuck off with that argument. I\u2019ve been playing OG zombies my whole life. Is it too much to ask for a new game that caters to us OGs and Cold War fanatics?",
            "You being dissapointed isn't truth, it's an opnion",
            "\"the truth\" being just your opinion",
            "Bro they made sure to have 1 of everything this better be the funniest most interesting set of characters in the cod franchise or it\u2019s just gonna be boring slop that was put together to look nice",
            "[removed]",
            "Ofc we can shit on the new stuff. Nah but no way in hell you\u2019re saying the new shit has the potential to be like one of the goat maps or anywhere near it",
            "Now kith",
            "Let me dumb it down for ya. Say 100 people are working on a call of duty game. Say 40 multilayer, 30 campaign and 30 zombies. Now if you add another mode within zombies like outbreak those 30 people working on round based zombies would then be split maybe 20 on round based 10 on outbreak. That means round based zombies is losing 33% of the staff working on it! In turn the quality is likely to drop 33%. That is the problem with adding additional modes like outbreak and that is why vanguard and cold war struggled to perform. For those who enjoy outbreak it should be a MW exclusive so those people can play MW whilst the ones like myself can play BO.",
            "You don't get to ask. The game isn't catering to you. It's catering to what makes the most money. That's how it works. That's the reality",
            "I\u2019m not talking about my opinion. I\u2019m talking about things out of this context",
            "Half Russian half American white dude, British white woman, American black dude, nationally ambiguous black woman I don't see how this is 1 of everything",

            "You\u2019re definitely on the spectrum",
            "I dont expect it to be Origins, i expect it to be its own thing. And im open minded enough to not shit on it for no reason. I don't necessarily trust the new Treyarch team but i am giving them a chance. Hell im getting the game on Gamepass so im not even really out much if the mode is bad.",

            "Yeah I'm sure they understand that my guy",
            "Cold War isn\u2019t a survival game, it\u2019s just a game where you go around and kill zombies with OP weapons and abilities to unlock things like camos and upgrades. We need the immersive survival aspect back, especially how much they focus on graphics nowadays. \n\nIn the best case scenario it would be both. Bo1, bo2, and bo3 catered to both playstyles. Cold War only caters to one.",
            "Ah yes as opposed to white Nazi dude, white American dude, white Russian dude, Japanese dude",
            "And they don\u2019t do it \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe devs understand but all Activision sees is money. They don\u2019t give af",
            "...This is literally your opinion. What you're claiming we \"need\" is your opinion. There are no facts here. There are many people who enjoy the cold war gameplay style. And you being OP doesn't make it not survival. That's not how it works. The game is factually a survival game because of its premise and objective.",
            "They have actual personalities and interesting designs just because you hate white people doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be in games lmfao",
            "They're not stupid. They clearly know what they're doing. They have entire teams filled with people whose whole careers is doing what you're doing right now. They spend millions on that. But I'm sure you know more than they do lmao",
            "Cold War\u2019s premise isn\u2019t about survival. They\u2019re a slowly straying away from that.\n\nIt\u2019s not my opinion. It\u2019s impossible to explain this over a Reddit comment. I\u2019m not going to further this any more. We will see how the game is when it comes out.",

It is said to be an iconic setting for zombies and an Americana 90's theme. There is video stores, a motel, a gas station, a bowling alley, a comic shop, and a church. It is set in a town in the West Virginia mountains, with the mountains being the background scenery/skybox. This map is the bright and sunny map while Terminus is the dark one. \n\n* This map is said to be the casual pick up and play map.\n* Set in the same time as Terminus \n* Will include a Main EE as well as many side EE to discover when we play.\n* In the past, the following has been leaked associated with Liberty Falls\n   * Includes a bank that has a working bank system similar to Town in Transit.\n   * Includes the return of Jet Gun\n   * People have said that this is Treyarch's reimagining of a transit like map, but this is just based off speculation, not confirmed at all.

Sorry out of zombie experience there. Any who. The ol' MrRofl's has a fun video on the whole transit thing. He was looking up locations in West Virginia or something or another dealing with the game. Sorry it's been a day or two since I watched it, but he essentially found the actual Green Run not far from where he was looking. Had the church and bridges and all in the area. Whether or not it hold water like a tin can full of buckshot or not who knows. Another thing though is that I noticed it says that the maps are set in the same time I am assuming that means the same time period and not the same time. Yeah I know I'm probably an igit, but I just was clarifying to make sure, because it would be hard to have dedicated operators if said operators are still breaking out of jail. Also with that supposedly you don't have to choose the dedicated operator. Like in cold war you can choose. Just the D.O. has more storyline dialogue. In other words and sorry to those who didn't like this bit, it means there will be more radio chatter. Which honestly at least the D.O. will talk back and not be just a silent listener.",

            "For real. It\u2019s like everyone just forgot the BO4 cycle existed. That\u2019s the exact moment he was blacklisted. He went IN on Treyarch and Activision for delivering a product that genuinely did not work at launch. Even after months and months of working to fix the crashes across all platforms, it got better but was never where it should have been.\n\nI was in the livestream when they were competing for worlds first EE on Tag Der Toten. The energy was electric as they were nearing the end. Then right before the finish line as they were about to get the cutscene\u2026 blue screen. No one got the achievement. He had to google someone else\u2019s capture of end cutscene. They had been at it for hours. This was for all intents and purposes at the time supposed to be the end of the story that had been building for over 10 years. There was such a massive pit in everyone\u2019s stomach. But that was that game.\n\nThey put all of their chips in hyping up what the game was supposed to be and delivered a literal broken piece of software that over promised and under delivered. The communication from devs basically disappeared after launch unlike the standard they set during and after BO3 and what appeared was supposed to continue in BO4. Features that were announced at launch just never happened. Crashes plagued every single platform and made some EEs literally impossible to complete. Even when they weren't technically impossible, it was not uncommon for attempts to be unceremoniously ended due to a blue screen. Several world firsts got rug pulled by that shit.\n\nMilo was mad that they had been promised a solid followup to the amazing standard that was set in BO3 and what was delivered was a broken, unfinished, piece of shit that was genuinely not worth the price of admission. $110 for game and BOPass for those keeping score btw. If that's not justification to be mad when his entire career and reputation relies on their success just as much as their own does, I don't know what is. The games really haven't recovered from this drop in community outreach either. There hasn't really been anything like Blundell's outreach since. \n\nI don't know why we seem to whitewash that era of zombies. Mechanic changes not even being considered, BO4 was a failure because on a functional level, it just did not work. Milo was mad and let them have it. The devs shouldn't be put on a pedestal either especially if they're gonna sell us a $110 product that does not work.",
            "Again, as another commenter has said, there's a difference between being critical and just grifting off of negativity. \"Buy the Black Ops Pass to get audio, guys\" in response to a teaser gif is NOT valid criticism whatsoever, that's just being unnecessarily mean-spirited. And like I said, there's likely more to the story than what's on the surface, but we should NOT put any YouTuber on a pedestal.",

            "Unmatched in terms of speed for sure! No nonsense guides do have more details which can be helpful for confusing steps. I really like watching glitch's guides to review an easter egg, but I have trouble following them blind and usually need the more in depth explanations like in the no nonsense.",
            "You think they dropped him over a tweet? I'd be more inclined to think it's the regular criticism personally.",
            ">\u00a0\"Buy the Black Ops Pass to get audio, guys\"\n\nSorry but I cannot possibly agree this is a scathing, mean-spirited comment. This is a light-hearted joke at most. And again, when he has constantly called out the company for their monetization and overall quality (such as online only, no local, instability, etc.), that makes for a much more likely reason why he was cut off other than he cracked a few jokes. \n\n>\u00a0we should NOT put any YouTuber on a pedestal.\n\nNor should we put a company on a pedestal. Do you honestly believe Activision is more concerned with whether he hurt their feelings over his consistent critiques of the games?",
            "Omg im blind i was writing that at 6am",
            "Unfortunately it is",
            "But they seem to have changed the UI to a black ops UI for their game at least",
            "Can\u2019t really remember because MWZ damage is tiered by different zones and hard to say how it would be in round-based.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s 3 plates of armor, and I think I recall tier 2 zombies did half a plate of damage, and max tier might\u2019ve been a full plate or like 75% of one.\n\nYou don\u2019t buy armor or refill in MWZ the same as CW either. It\u2019s like you spawn with armor, but it\u2019s empty. Had it\u2019s own resource with armor plates that you picked up from zombies or bought from stations. You would hold the weapon switch button to refill a plate of armor which had an animation kinda like drinking a perk, and you could hold 5 pieces max without using the rucksack.\n\nDon\u2019t know if it would work exactly the same, but it seems like that might be the system in BO6 judging by some leaked images.",
            "Obviously not a single tweet, but moreso his behavior through Black Ops 4 as a whole, as well as earlier instances- ie. as someone mentioned earlier in this thread, the team gifting him a shirt with the Apothicon language on it as something for him to share with the community, only for him to keep it entirely to himself and leave the community to unravel the language for themselves based on scraps.\n\nMilo isn't the only content creator to have criticized Call of Duty; *most* Call of Duty content creators, Zombies or otherwise, are generally openly critical of the series. To me, Milo being barred from creator events seems more like an issue that the Zombies team specifically has with him, rather than a (entirely feasible) case of Activision blacklisting someone who isn't constantly praising each release.",
            "I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on the comment thing, because I simply do not see that as a light-hearted joke at all. Especially since, as you said, he's been critical of the monetization. In what world would we take that as a simple joke?\n\nAnd I do NOT think highly of ATVI either. In this situation, everybody simply sucks, and ATVI is more concerned about the people they work with being a liability. I'm sorry if that's not what you want to hear, but let's not act like you aren't biased for Milo because \"Activision bad\" here. Plenty of YouTubers like PrestigeIsKey also often criticize ATVI, yet they still get invites anyway. So I am confident in saying that Milo screwed the pooch somehow, and it's not something that can be taken lightly.",

            ">I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on the comment thing, because I simply do not see that as a light-hearted joke at all\n\nStill no source on that comment? Context matters a lot, and you're really hanging on it without giving that.\n\n>Especially since, as you said, he's been critical of the monetization. In what world would we take that as a simple joke?\n\n\"We?\" Activision? Is that you? But I'd take it as a simple joke because it sounds like a simple joke lol. It's inherently absurd, nobody thinks he's realistically accusing activision of withholding audio behind a paywall.\n\n\n\nThat aside, it's not as though he was the only one making jokes at the Black Ops Pass. Remember, the season pass formula was already dying out then, and yet not only did Activision announce they were doing another season pass that year, they removed the ability to buy the map packs individually. Hence it become a joke that a lot of people made fun of, he was far from the only one (again this is assuming that quote's real, because I can't really trust you after that first quote).\n\n>ATVI is more concerned about the people they work with being a liability.\u00a0\n\nIf by \"liability\" you mean bad for business because he harshly critiques the games, then yes I agree. Activision is concerned with profit above all else.\n\n>Plenty of YouTubers like PrestigeIsKey also often criticize ATVI\n\nLook I enjoy Prestige's content, but he is practically never as harsh as Milo has been in the past. Activision isn't going to drop their influencers over any criticism. It's prolonged and harsh criticism that sets Milo apart in this regard.\n\n>\u00a0I'm sorry if that's not what you want to hear, but let's not act like you aren't biased for Milo because \"Activision bad\" here.\n\nWhat are you even talking about? All I have said here is that the reason Activision dropped him is clearly over his criticism. I'm not sure what weird conspiracy you seem to think went down. \n\n>I am confident in saying that Milo screwed the pooch somehow, and it's not something that can be taken lightly.\n\nSeriously, what in the fuck are you even talking about dude?",

            "If the denezins wasn\u2019t in it it\u2019d been a goat so much map and places to go and explore while fucking up zombies woulda been to easy tho with out them",
            "Tranzit is goated",
            "You can understand the intent while not agreeing with the decision. They didn't put phd on the map for a reason, but I don't agree with that decision and that's valid. You can disagree with my opinion without trying to invalid it. Trying to do so just makes you an asshole.",
            "And the idea of fall damage being a bigger threat than the zombies is fucking stupid imo so then putting PhD in an inaccessible location is borderline unforgivable",
            "Care to elaborate? Or you just like meat riding the hivemind",
            "This applies to everyone, you can like and dislike whatever the hell you want, dont let a bumch of dummies whining on the internet control your enjoyment lol",
            "Calling one of the most important and useful feauture of the map \"useless\" because there is only one may be the most ridiculous thing ive seen come out of the comment section",
            "Bro is fighting imaginary comments",
            "Looks like someone failed reading comprehension in school",
            "Why were you lying?",
            "It can't be the best zombies game because it isnt zombies, its more like Outbreak from CW\n\nIts like comparing apples and oranges, MWZ (DMZ reskin with zombies) is nowhere near comparable to round based zombies games, literally the only common ground between the two is zombies and the same universe.\n\nIts not that you think MWZ is \"the best zombies game\" you just dont like round based zombies lmao, you prefer an open map and everything which is fine, its just not comparable in the slightest",
            "Oof. L take. That map is great. Last year I wrangled in a bunch of randoms off public match and convinced them all to do Shang EE. One of the best memories I\u2019ve made with zombies. Shang is a great map.",
            "The correct opinion",
            "And? You don't speak for everyone who dislikes the map.",

            "Never said I enjoy it. It's boring as hell",
            "Way back when I got high round exploiting that one prone glitch. If they gave us the sliquifier again, nothing would make me happier. I wish i gave BO2 more time but\u2026. Ya know\u2026 BO3",
            "I said \"doesn't mean the design succeeded\" for a reason. I'm in the camp of Die Rise's gimmick not being a successful one, partly due to how FUBAR the engine is with vertical movement in the first place. The first part is just calling out that the \"everyone's opinion is valid\" shtick in general.",
            "It\u2019s a poorly designed map. The verticality wasn\u2019t really pulled off and the lack of PHD means the fall damage kills you more than the zombies do. The WW also shouldn\u2019t have been patched.",
            "Bc id rather not trade out EA for having the most downvoted comment on reddit. I havent seen a single post nonetheless comment on this sub saying someone liked MW3 zombies. Not wanting to be insulted for my preference, I just didnt mention it.",
            "I feel insulted, but yes, you are correct. The \u2018cant be compared at all\u2019 part is debatable ig, but that I dont like round based, yes. Legit, you die once and its all over bc your gun is too weak to get the kills you need to get money, and from the times I have played round based zombies, your team wont do shit to help other than camp in specific spot and not dare leave his precious little home. On MWZ, dying isnt a huge problem bc of self revives, and since its often a squad effort to wipe out the horde instead of everyone picking their spot on the tiny ass map and praying to god they can handle the swarm, you can often fend off things and have teammates that actually help you. Not to mention, you arent forced to fight zombies that make Mike Tyson look like a twig after like 10 minutes, you can prepare before going into a more dangerous area.",
            "I know, was just commenting my own opinion on it, its one of my mates favourite maps I just personally have it at the bottom of my list because I\u2019m just ass at it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd",
            "But because that opinion is invalid, it makes the paradox about the paradox being invalid, invalid",
            "i\u2019m eating this",
            "Oh didn\u2019t even realize BO3 had Die rise, I stopped at Bo2. Yeah just found out if you shoot a random neon sign 10 times with the siliq it converts it to the pre-nerf higher chaining siliq lmao. Weird spaghetti code",
            "> I said \"doesn't mean the design succeeded\" for a reason.\n\nAnd I'm saying someone can understand why phd isn't on the map and still think the map sucks for not having it which is valid.\n\n> The first part is just calling out that the \"everyone's opinion is valid\" shtick in general.\n\nThere's nothing to call out. When it comes to video games as long as your opinion isn't hateful it's a valid opinion and that includes zombies. You can disagree with an opinion you don't like about die rise or zombies in general without trying to invalidate it.",
            "Didn't mean any insult lol, your totally valid \n\nAs for the rest I think thats just based off your experience, round based definitely has a tough learning curve and most people still playing are vets that assume you are as knowledgeable as they are, meanwhile MWZ is more focused on collaboration no matter the circumstance.\n\nBut I do stand by them not being comparable, they are polar opposites in every aspect of gameplay, small vs big, movement vs staying in one area and training, loadout vs starting weapon etc etc. The fact that you can hate one and enjoy another so much just shows you how vastly different they are, you cant compare a horror to a comedy and say one is worse than another, if that makes sense.",
            "It sounded like you were trying to defend shangri-la fans.",
