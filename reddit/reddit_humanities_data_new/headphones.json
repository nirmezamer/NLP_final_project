            "I've got two pairs of Sony 7506 headphones I use for recording and mixing. I really like the way they sound, I think the honest sound is helpful for mixing, but I feel like they might be lacking on bass? They never give a booming sound. When I turn on my bigger studio monitors, the bass sounds completely different than what I was hearing with the 7506s.\n\nWhat should I trust more? I know the 7506s are the 'truest' headphones, but am I the only one that feels like the bass response is lacking? Should I trust my 7506s, my studio monitors, or should I mix somewhere in-between the two?\n\n  \nThanks!",
            "i bought a pair of LG tone FP5 less than a year ago and i am having some quite annoying issues.\n\nAs of now my right earbud is working pretty bad, when i connect the device to my phone/pc only the left bud works, the right one is completely disconnected and doesnt even do the \"blip\" sound when you put it in your ear, as if it's completely turned off. at random if i put it back in and out it reconnects, works for 10 seconds then disconnect again. Sometimes it even goes mad and it's suddenly the left one not working instead of the right? (but still, mainly the right one is not working)\n\ni downloaded the app, lg tone free, and it says the earbud is literally disconnected.\n\nsometimes when it \"works\" if i put it back into the custody it should turn off and music should only exit from the left earbud but for some reason it stays on and you can hear music coming out of its charger box, as if it was still in my ear.\n\ni tried polishing the electrodes and i tried to do factory reset multiple times but i don't know why it keeps having this problem. anyone has a fix to try?\n\nconsidering i had these less than a year and considering how much they cost i can't reccommend them as a product to buy\n\nedit: i should also mention that it keeps saying the battery is very low but even staying inside it's box all day it doesn't charge. there was this one time where if put inside the box it showed \"right bud battery at 45%\" and the moment i removed it it dropped to 15%, starting to scream \"battery is very low, please charge now\"",

I have a pair of AKG K371BT headphones that I love, but they have a known design flaw where the headband can easily crack or break at the joint (see attached image with measurements).\n\nI'm looking for ideas on how to reinforce this weak point to prevent further damage.

They have done this before, like the HE-5XX is the Deva with a different headband despite Drop denying it.\n\nThe OG Ananda does not sound identical, the Edition XS and Ananda Stealth have noticeably more bass while the OG Ananda is a bit smoother/more relaxed in the treble. The Edition XS and Ananda Stealth though, to me sound literally identical.\n\nThe clamp force is very different. Ananda is very firm, Edition XS is almost nothing to the point it fell off my head and I needed to bend the EXS just to have it stay on. There may be very slight sound differences on a particular head that stem from this clamp force difference, as it can affect seal and driver distance from the ear and this will change the sound slightly, as well as slightly changing the measured impedance and sensitivity.\n\nI would recommend the Ananda Stealth because I do think the headband is a lot better. When it was only +$20 for the Ananda Stealth, worth it, I'd say up to +$50 at least it's worth it.

            "Started with a Topping E50/L50 stack, powering the Meze 109 Pros. It came very nicely packaged, the build quality is exceptional (and heavy) and the sound is amazing! On another note, I have not been able to find much info on this Skylight edition aside from it being a limited edition and only 200 units were supposedly produced.",
            "Thanks! I agree, I wish the plastic cover inside was more transparent to see better details, as well as having customizable lighting inside to show it off. But, it is a fantastic looking combo.",
            "Thanks, they are the Dekoni DT Elite Hybrid pads and they are way better than the stock pads. See the link:\n\nhttps://dekoniaudio.com/product/elite-hybrid-ear-pads-for-beyerdynamic-headphones/",

        "content": "For me, it has to be the Hifiman Edition XS. I'm still using Resolve's EQ profile to this day, it woeks so well I never really bothered tweaking anything else unlike most other headphones in my collection. \n\nThere's something that feels so complete or simply \"right\" about this package that makes it my go to when I just want to have fun listening to music on my DAP around the flat. \n\nIt's got good treble extension without ever coming across as being sibilant. Good extension in the sub bass while being surprisingly punchy for a planar. The technical performance is just right, enough so that I don't feel like I'm missing anything in the mix (and then some!). The overall frequency response is balanced across the board such that no particular range is overly emphasized or muted. With Resolve's EQ, it has this ever so mild V-shape quality to it, with just a bit of mid to sub bass bump and a touch of treble sparkle that I feel benefits most genres, particularly stuff that uses percussion heavily, like metal. \n\nIt may not have the same imaging precision / separation ability of my HD800, or the soap-bubble popping timbre of the HD6XX/HD600, but I find myself enjoying this pair time and time again without fail when all I want to do is listen to music. If I were to start from scratch with this hobby, I think that the Edition XS is the pair I'd go for and call it a day.",

            "It\u2019s a toss up between the Meze 109 Pros and HD600s with the Copper Mass Loading mod and fenestrated sheepskin pads. \n\nI have other sets I love, LCD-X for metal and hard rock, Focal Radiance for rock and hip hop, the HD490s Pros are amazing for acoustic and OSTs; but with the 109s or 600s, I can listen to any genre and never think, \u201cI\u2019m missing something.\u201d\n\nFor IEMs, that\u2019s a bit harder. The FatFreq Grand Maestro, given its versatility, is probably a safe pick. But the IEM I find myself continuing to go back to is the Hype 4. I have an EQ that brings a bit more sparkle in to get closer to my Monarch MK3, but even in its stock tuning I could listen to that set for hours. The Meze Alba may replace it, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see.",
            "I have found myself using my HD58x a lot recently. It works very well for everything outside of bass-heavy electronic stuff, and I can listen to something like metal and change to hip-hop and still enjoy them. \n\nVery fun headphones that I feel get overlooked.",
            "HD660S2, followed by the Edition XS.\n\nThe latter is easier to listen to for a long time at lower volumes. The S2 demands high volume listening.",
            "Clear OG and 660s2. Clear is better in a lot of ways bust less comfortable to wear than the 660s2.",
            "The Andromedas may as well be my favorite too in  terms of IEMs (pre-2020 version tho).",
            "I have the Shure E5C and SE530PTH (they are still kicking, even with their non-detachable cables, lol); do you happen to have any experience with either of those? I\u2019m curious as to how the se846 compares/ contrasts with them.",
            "Yea, the imaging and separation on those is awesome. Whereas most headphones I've tried place everything roughly left-center-right, the HD800 really does give you this sense that music is playing \"left-leftcenter-center-right center-right\". Not to say that other headphones don't do this to some extent, but with the HD800 it can be uncannily obvious depending on recording.",
            "That's how I roll as well but lately I've found myself using the same pair to listen to mostly everything, and only switching pairs when I want a different flavor or a particular quality emphasized in my music.",
            "That only depends on how you favour your music being exaggerated. Some people don't, so to them, the most incisive tuning might be all they need.",
            "Well as you said most headphone do that to a extent I say the HD800s do it better then the rest\u00a0"
