I'm looking for a car that is fun to drive that isn't majorly expensive to maintain but I am willing to do the work and learn how to work on the car to bring the costs down. I do notice that the FK8 in fuel economy isn't the best especially in comparison to the BMWs I've been looking at. I've heard a lot of good things in terms of the reliability of the B58 and I know the K20C1 in the Type R is also an amazing engine in terms of reliability too. However, I seem to be a little bit torn as I haven't heard as many good things about the handling or the response from either BMWs but it can be improved through mods. Just wondering if anyone can put their two cents in and justify either one. I have also considered the GR Yaris and i30N but I do like having a larger car for the boot space and space for passengers.",

            "I owned an Avantime for around 6 months and I absolutely adored it.\n\nIt was like driving the Louvre on wheels, the seats were comfier than the beds in the Savoy and I never got bored of the over-engineered doors which, even though they were effectively barn doors with metallic paint (I believe they were the longest doors fitted to any production car at the time) actually needed less room to open than almost any other car because of the double hinges.\n\nIt was brilliant. Right up until the moment it developed an electrical issue so brutal that it made the gentleman who ran my local Renault specialist retire. After trying everything I possibly could, I gave up and decided to cut my losses. \n\nI ended up selling it to a man who owned 10 of them, in every colour. Cocaine would have been a more sensible addiction.",
            "Always liked the Wind, a proper weird thing that only the French would build. Hilariously impractical and not very fast, but the 1.6 engine was punchy enough around town and it actually handled nicely. I like it when we get weird stuff like that, rather than most stuff now which is just playing it safe and boring.",
            "Story from Pistonheads:\n\n> When we had a Renault I saw a blue [Avantime] parked up outside [the dealership].\n\n> I mentioned to the sales guy I was talking with that it was a rare beast - he replied: \"Yeah, thank God he's only popped in to order some windscreen wipers. The entire service bay went into panic when they saw it drive in. I think the service manual is being used to prop up a wonky filing cabinet. We've never serviced one and the one tech here who went on the original training course went green around the gills as all eyes turned on him.\"\n\nI do love 'em though. Any car company that's brave enough to productionize a pillarless three-door semi-convertible people-carrier gets a thumbs up from me.",
            "Used to be a workshop near me that mostly worked on old Alpines. \n\nIf you have a niche make it a fun one.",
            "I have a mild Renault Sport addiction and was wondering recently about whether you could squeeze the Megane sport engine in the wind (track car for the missus) but if it\u2019s doable it would be a lot of work.\n\nRegarding the avantime, there is a collector in the UK that has one of each colour that was sold here. Now that\u2019s dedication \ud83d\ude02",
            "Can\u2019t park there mate(s)",
            "Always loved the Wind, really want to get one eventually.",
            "I've never seen an Avantime in my entire life, I wonder how many of them are left.",
            "Love the Renault Wind!\n\nThere's about 5 where I live, one's even got a personalised WIND number plate\ud83d\ude02",
            "Off topic but this thread got me thinking about the Renault Spyder. Never seen one in real life. Bet they are no longer the bargain they once were.",
            "There's a Renault Wind near me that's badged as Ventus, lol",
            "Do you pronounce it wind or wind?",
            "Renault was the last non-german brand that had the BALLS to do something different, as the Wind and Avantime (and the Laguna Coup\u00e9 IMHO). Germans can dream up utter shite and people will buy it (R-class, i3, BMW 5-series GT, 1-series, etc).",
            "This reminds me of the episode the grand tour did on France and french cars \ud83e\udd23 merci monsieur and bonjour monsieur when james and richard crash \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d",
            "The Wind and the late 90s Clio just makes me think of who worked in the design department and thought that ugly drivers wiper with the pivot looks better than just properly pointing the wiper the correct way for RHD cars",
            "The Avantime is a car I would like to own at one point in the future.",
            "The Avantine was just ahead of its time,  which probably put people off..   Which i always find weird\n\nThe Wind was essentially just a Hard-Top Convetible Twingo but less practical in every way  lol",
            "Both of them should be classified as french war crimes. They are attacks on sensible motoring.",
            "Whats the light blue Renault called? Never saw it before, there is no way there are many of those around anymore",
            "Koleos",
            "I've only seen a wild Avantime once, this was at a petrol station in a village near Corby many years ago.",
            "Thank god for that!",
            "Looking up Armstrong Autos on the map it looks like the exact kind of place I'd look for to take my car for servicing - down a long narrow side road, off a side road. No passing trade, all their business comes by word of mouth.\n\nI bet the receptionist / office manager is related to or cohabiting with the head mechanic.",
            "The XT08 plate adds to the strangeness, aren\u2019t those meant to be plates reserved for exported cars",
            "I initially thought this was a FB style 'Parked like a twat' post lol",
            "Harry Dwyer has one, he\u2019s using on his slow circumnavigation of the UK in a tiny rib https://youtube.com/@harrydwyer?si=rNzIrhYwk6eX3kL7",
            "I miss mad Renaults",
            "My colleague has a wind and it makes me physically sick",
            "both of what? idiots?",
            "Where\u2019s a traffic warden when you need one? Or a tow truck?",
            "Sounds lovely.  I kinda want one to match my Wind",
            "I think I've seen that guy on instagram reels!",
            "What is it with French cars and electrical problems? My wife's Clio developed a fault where the lights just stopped working down one side, then there's the seatbelt sensor beeping that comes and goes every few months for no apparent reason, both Peugeots I owned suffered from battery drain that I never got to the bottom of. I've never had an electrical issue on any other car so it's most definitely a French thing.",
            "> Right up until the moment it developed an electrical issue so brutal that it made the gentleman who ran my local Renault specialist retire.\n\nClassic Renault.",
            "Have you seen the YouTube using his [avantime](https://youtu.be/L_w5hhVe1eQ?si=mCT554v0cW3cZcrB) to trailer his home brewed jet boat around the uk.\n\nAs if this car was not mental enough...imagine seeing one pulling a   dingy with a massive outboard bolted to the back",
            "I've got the 1.2 in mine, but I think it's loads of fun",
            "Lets not forget the styling and name which tricks most people into thinking it's an electric car.",
            "Some of the current French offerings are a bit barmy, like the c4X, DS7 lights and DS9. Only the French can get away with it lol",
            "Exactly lol",
            "Near Tobacco Dock?",
            "Funnily enough, I wondered the same thing about the Wind. And yh, that's impressive dedication for such a quirky car.",
            "It fits in the twingo and it shares a lot between the two as far as I could tell when I had one.",
            "I was waiting for this lol. I wasn't parked.",
            "Let them off, they've got Wind",
            "Do it lol. You only live once",
            "According to Howmanyleft.com, there is 125 in the UK, but I know one guy has a dozen all by himself.",
            "I know there is at least 1 in Cardiff. It is the only one I have ever seen in my life and I remember how excited I was and how confused everyone else was because they just see a Renault that isn\u2019t exactly a work of art to most people. Nor does it look exotic or anything. When I bring up the fact there are hardly any at all. Like in the few hundreds at most iirc then they start to understand",
            "about 100 plus nationwide on the road, another 100 sorn...out if 450 odd sold here\n\nI've had my 3ltr for 12 years and love it to bits. deffo a marmite motor.",
            "Nice. I was tempted by a WIND plate, but decided against it in the end",
            "Yh. If they weren't silly money, I'd want to get one. I've only seen one before, a few weeks ago at a car show.\n\nEdit: just looked. \u00a340k - \u00a350k",
            "I pronounce it gaz intestinaux",
            "I've always said wind. Other people also say wind.",
            "I'd pronounce it Wind, personally.",
            "Yh, not so much any more, but I do respect Renault, and the other French manufacturers, for just going sod it, and doing something wild.",
            "You and me both lol",
            "sensible = uninteresting and tiresome",
            ">They are attacks on sensible motoring.\n\nThat's the entire point of French cars lol.",
            "Who wants sensible? Lol",
            "The light blue one on the left is my Renault Wind. There's 1,935 currently registered in the UK, according to Howmanyleft.com. \n\nThere's only 125 of the other one though, so both relatively rare vehicles",
            "Not doing too bad then lol. Including this one, I've only seen two.",
            "I can see why, but I've explained elsewhere in these comments that neither had been left there lol",
            "Why? Lol. What's wrong with it?",
            "I take your point, but as 5 said to other commenters, neither had been left there, and both were gone after the picture was taken.",
            "His insta is @ballswing - he has some other very nice cars as well as the Avantime collection.",
            "On my mates Clio the wipers would only work if it wasn't raining.",
            "I had a 172 cup for a bit, the dash only worked when it wanted to... would randomly cut out while driving along. This also stopped the mileage going up.\n\nDone a round trip from Scotland to Blyton park (bumfuck nowhere Lincolnshire) and only put about 50 miles on the clock.",
            "My VW and BMW both had electrical issues its just the mysteries of electrics. Hell even at work we have unexplainable electrical issues while building diggers. Sometimes the wipers go on when you hit a diffrent Button but it sometimes only appears at random with no reasonable explanation.",
            "I had a clio back in the day, trouble starting one morning only for when it did start the rev counter decided to not work, a couple of hits to the instrument cluster worked a treat.",
            "I've only driven the 1.6, but I bet the 1.2 is still a laugh. I had a 1.2 Clio ages ago and had a blast with it, legitimately one of my favourite cars I've ever owned.",
            "Yes.",
            "Looks pretty parked, was it slowly rolling?",
            "That is the exact reason why you should never get one.",
            "So double what they were then. There used to be a few on auto trader when i was interested in them about 10 years ago for about \u00a320k. Which was ludicrous money then considering that used to buy you a nice Elise.",
            "When I went on holiday people were pronouncing it 'wind'. Madness.",
            "I know this is slightly in jest, but does anyone actually call it wind?!",
            "French Silly motoring = Odd looking, uninteresting and tire some",
            "The suspect on the left has doors that require almost another space in a car park to open fully, and the suspect on the right has less range than one requires to get to a corner shop. The defence rests your honour.",
            "Just looked it up, never seen it before but the Wind reminds me so much of the cabriolet version of the Ford Ka. I love it! Only the french could pull off such an interesting design though, the Ka is boring in comparison",
            "The Wind seems remarkably common for a rare care. There\u2019s one over the road from me, one in a nearby town and a chap I did some work with for a while had one.",
            "You've got me beat, these have to be far rarer than my Crown Vic which is madness.",
            "Sounds like my friend with an Espace mk1 addiction",
            "They were great to drive apart from the gearbox being a little sloppy, my wife had a 182 Sport and I had a Civic Type R back in the day.... Then we had kids and all that fun had to stop.",
            "Wifey has the Gordini Wind. It's like driving a go kart. \n\nSuch a hoot to drive..",
            "Ah cool. He moved to Great Dunmow. Now has a much larger unit in Great Dunmow to fit more Alpine goodness.",
            "Yh. You just can't see it because it's a picture lol. I was waiting for a van to move, so got the pic while I was waiting.",
            "Yh. Tbf, they're less than I thought theyd be, but there is a long list of cars I'd rather have for \u00a350k",
            "I've already done this. Ffs, listen. You pronounce it WIND.",
            "This guy sees a two-door MPV coup\u00e9 styled like a modern art gallery on wheels and says it's 'uninteresting'. I absolutely understand if you don't like the Avantime, but it is absolutely an interesting car.",
            "Tbf, My least favourite thing about my car is the size of the doors.",
            "> the suspect on the right has less range than one requires to get to a corner shop\n\nThe car on the right, assuming it is indeed a 100 TCe, has a 40 litre petrol tank. That's not huge, but it's enough for such a small car, should give a range of about 300-400 miles depending on your driving style.",
            "I certainly think so. Hard top convertible too, so it doesn't leak.",
            "I'm just being a nob M8, no harm no foul.",
            "It's a MPV powered by a dull selection of french petrol and diesel engines, Yeah it looks funky, but like most french cars it probably won't be very inspiring to drive.",
            "I drive an Audi A5 coupe. So to be fair I can't say shit about having doors you can open next to another car. I have to park my car a mile away from everyone else in the supermarket.",
            "Thats a plus!",
            "Nah, no problem lol, I just know some people will be dicks about me spending 30 seconds waiting on a double yellow, so covering my bases for those individuals.",
            "Yh lol. I've had to open the roof and climb in over the door before lol, because I've been trapped in."
