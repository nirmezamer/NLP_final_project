            "I'm thinking of doing the Ange Postecoglou challenge this year as an Aussie, or atleast my own flexible version of it.\n\n1. Start as a manager in the Australian A-League, I will be using the western sydney wanderers as they are my local team, match his trophy achievements.\n\n2. Move to a club in Japan, match his trophy achievements\n\n3. Move to a club in Scotland, match his trophy achievements\n\n4. Move to a club in the premier league & aim to win it all to finish the save!\n\nShould be a fun year on this year's game!",
            "Hertha Berlin. In the 2.Bundesliga now, they've got a handful of great youth prospects, and you should be able to get promoted fairly easily. \n\nQPR. Predicted rock bottom with a league one level squad, although they've got a few solid championship players (Chair, Willock, Dykes). \n\nSampdoria. Nowhere near as bad as they are doing in real life, promotion should be relatively achievable. Few good youth prospects and needs a bit of a squad rebuild upon promotion.",
            "Middelfart are a team in the lower divisions of Denmark. If you want a long save and a team with a funny name then look no further!",
            "I think that M\u00e1laga are a pretty good shout. Nice crest, good support, went from being seconds away from the UCL semi-finals in 2013 to now being in the third division.\n\nI did my first save with M\u00e1laga this year and it has been such a fun save. The team is miles better than any team in the third tier and, if you improve the squad with free transfers and loans, promotion in your first season in the second tier isn't impossible either.",
            "Kerry FC. Newly formed team in Ireland playing their first ever season after getting a licence to play in the Irish First Division. They have the youngest squad in the league and are predicted to finish bottom but they have a few quality attackers for the level they're playing at to help you compete in the first season. The goal is to turn them into the best team in Ireland, with transfer restrictions being nonexistent using loans and free transfers from England and Scotland at first then build a team of wonderkids, qualify for the UCL, something an Irish team has never done before and improve Irish soccer as the top league is rated 74th in the world.",
            "If anyone wants some clubs with cool badges in Italy\u2026\n\nCalcio Foggia 1920 \n\nDelfino Pescara 1936\n\nCesena FC\n\nSo many others though.",
            "Here's a good shout that i am considering for my first save this year:\n\nReal Zaragoza. Big city in Spain, and their club used to be a good side in La Liga. They have however been in La Liga 2 for some time now. They seem to be on the verge of a resurgence now, setting a new club record with like 28.000 season tickets bought for this season. Has very good facilities and there should be plenty of chances of getting great homegrown talents.\n\nBut perhaps the best thing is that they have a lot of young prospects in the team that you can build your team around for many years. In defence you have Alejandro Frances (20) and Hugo Barrachina (16). In midfield you have Francho (22) and when you start the save you also got Luis Carbonell out on loan, a former Real Madrid prospect. But the gems are in attack, as you got Ivan Azon (20), Pau Sans (18) and Jano Monserrate (17). Not gonna spoil what their potential are, but all i can say is that they can be seen on lists of potential wonderkids.",
            "Fc Sochaux in France.\n\nThey use to be a very good club and even got to Europe multiple times. The last time was in 2012\n\nThen they dropped to Ligue 2, and they got money problems and are now in National.\n\nThe team is now mainly focused on youth, and the whole country thinks about them.",
            "Chester - Wrexham\u2019s biggest rivals just across the border with an even more turbulent recent past ownership. Fan-owned so it\u2019s like the antithesis of a sugar daddy save.",
            "FC Vaduz, in the Swiss league. They are however from Lichtenstein meaning they can\u2019t qualify for Europe through the league. Winning the Lichtenstein cup gets you into the conference league, the only way to get into the Europa league is to win the conference & to get into the champions league you have to win the Europa.\n\nThis means that you have to win the conference, europa and then finally the champions league consecutively. If you are knocked out of either the Europa or champions league, you start from the conference again the following season",
            "Belenenses in Portugal. One of two teams besides the big 3 (Porto, Benfica and Sporting) to ever win the league title, they split from their investors in 2018. So a new club, B Sad, was created, that everyone hates. Belenenses went all the way down to the regional tier, slowly climbing back up and they are now in the second tier of portuguese football\n\nDespite a lackluster squad they have good to great youth recruitment and facilities. They are also based in Lisbon, which helps. It's a nice chance to restore glory to a historic club",
            "For the Birmingham fans out there that had a hard time managing them in the past due to the crippling debt, I reported the latest financial statements from last year to the Alpha testing forum showing how we \"only\" have about \u00a355m in a debt now compared to the \u00a395m or so that the game says we are in, and SI have gone and just straight up removed *all* of the clubs debt lol. So yeah, Birmingham will finally be a \"normal\" pain-free save now! \n\nI'm not sure if this is in the latest live build yet, but if not then it should be in the game when full release happens. Playing it on the latest Alpha build the club only has about 350k in debt now.",
            "Catania (Italian 3rd division). Historic team from southern Italy that had almost reached Europe a few years ago. Zenga, Cholo Simeone, Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107, Montella were also their coaches - Papu Gomez played a few years showing off some excellent qualities\r  \n\r  \nIn 2012 Catania was the surprise of the Serie A. They played spectacular football, so much so that they reserve the nickname \"little Barcelona\". After fighting throughout the Campionato for a place in the Europa League, Catania only finished in eleventh place, scoring 48 points.\r  \n\r  \nRolando Maran managed the team in the 2012\u201313 season, who guided Catania to a record-breaking season where they accrued 56 points from 38 Serie A matches. The season also saw Catania take a record number of home wins in one season, its record number of victories overall in a single top flight campaign, as well as its record points total in Serie A for the fifth consecutive season. They finished ahead of Inter at the conclusion of the season and were just five points away from competing in the UEFA Europa League",
            "Oldham recently became the first former Premier League club to fall out of the Football League. Would be a challenging save to take them back to the Prem while being located in an area with a lot of competition for youth players.\n\nTeams like Yeovil Town or Scunthorpe were in the Championship as recently as about 10 years ago, and are now in Tier 6 of English football.\n\nIf you wanted to take over a phoenix club in England, the likes of Darlington and Hereford are now at that level, or if you were downloading a database there is the possibility of taking over a club like Macclesfield or Bury lower down the pyramid.\n\nSouthend recently fell out of the Football League having also been as high as the Championship this century, and also start with a points deduction.\n\nFrom my native Northern Ireland, Larne recently won the NI Premier League and in real life have big ambitions to grow the club. I'd need to investigate them and other NI clubs in FM24 though - in real life, they have big backing from the former CEO of Purple Bricks. Other clubs that could be interesting include Glentoran and Linfield, who have the finances to challenge Larne. Cliftonville are the oldest team on the island of Ireland, and have a good youth system that most recently produced Sean Moore, who secured a move to West Ham in the summer. They may not have the finances to contend, but are a fun save and have a good spine by NI standards. Any NI club would be a good \"Build a Nation\" save though.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the LOI's newest team Kerry FC start in the 2023 season in the First Division. Could be an interesting save to build history in a part of Ireland that has never seen soccer representation in the LOI. Treaty United formed in 2021 following the demise of Limerick FC, and are the only club in the Irish Republic's third largest city. They're also in the First Division, like Kerry. Another suggestion for building history and challenging the Dublin clubs, with Shamrock Rovers having won the past four Premier Division titles.",

            "Acad\u00e9mica is a Portuguese team in the 3rd tier. A historic club in Portugal, they won the first ever Portuguese cup, and won it again in 2012. That same year, they defeated Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the Europa League.\n\nThey are based in Coimbra, one of the oldest cities in Portugal (dating all the way back to 1131) and a former capital of the country. The team and the city's identity is based on university students (who dress in all black, same as the kit)\n\nTerrible management has led them all the way down to the 3rd tier. Stadium is very big, competition in the city of Coimbra is nonexistent, training and youth facilities and recruitment are not bad at all",

They have a very sizeable transfer kitty due to selling gabri veiga , but restricted wage budget as per the laliga ruling , do not be fooled by the transfer and wage budget slider . \n\nAre you able to move on some of the wage-structure-breaking-deadwood in the first window and bring on new blood to immediately make an impact ? \n\nThe legend doesn\u2019t have much time left , clock is ticking ..

            "I'm going to do a long term save with Blyth Spartans (6th tier of England) focusing on developing my own youth players. They start with a bunch of good talents in their first and youth team so that should help. Also, if I'm signing players from outside my own youth I'll try to sign players from the north of England, mostly former Newcastle and Sunderland academy players because that's what Blyth has been doing IRL and I think it gives both a challenge and some identity to the save. And, of course, their badge is a Spartan helmet, so it doesn't get much cooler.",

            "My great grandfather came to America from the east side of Sicily, so personally I cannot wait to start my FM24 save with Catania Calcio. They have just been promoted to Serie C this season IRL after declaring for bankruptcy a few years back. I believe 2008 was their best finish in Serie A coming in 8th, but I will try to beat that after fighting for promotion to get back to the top side. It is a great club under the shadow of Mt Etna, which looks beautiful with some custom skins and city pictures in the game. They have a fierce rivalry with Palermo and it is definitely a challenge with some money tight owners and passionate fans.",
            "I have started with Polonia Warsaw, I simmed to December then started applying for jobs to getv the feel of saving a team if I can. They werr last in poland league 2.\n\nAs I looked into it more they have 2 titles to there name last one in 2000 and are fierce rivals with liga warsaw just got promoted to division 2 and are over 110years old its amazing what u can randomly find.",
            "Something I will always recommend if you\u2019re struggling for a save is sim the first season.\n\nLoad up your desired leagues / database and sim until the end of the competitive season (normally at the end of May). Name your manager Holiday man or whatever you please and skip until that date. From there, take a look at any vacant jobs and take over. Personally, I like to re-build one of the relegated sides and get immediate promotion. Maybe a big team has severely underperformed or a team has unexpectedly got relegated. You decide, good luck!",
            "Old Boys in Switzerland.\n\nA small club currently playing in the 5th tier of Switzerland but the interesting thing is that they inspired the founders of Young Boys who mimicked their name back in the 19th century when founding the club.\n\nThey are also one of the founding members of the Swiss championship which started in 1898/99, finishing as runners-up on that occasion. They have finished runners-up on 3 separate occasions in 1899, 1904 and 1913 but since then have had a steady downfall which means they have never been crowned Swiss champions before.\n\nThe aim of the save would be to slowly climb back up the Swiss football pyramid and eventually put an end to Young Boys\u2019 recent dominance in the league and finally being crowned champions. You can also take it a step further and do a Switzerland build a nation as you progress further into the save. If your type of save is taking over a lower league team then this is an interesting save I would recommend.",
            "My favourite \"role playing\" club and \"story building\" club is **Ergotelis F.C.** in 2nd division Greece.\n\nThey have some incredible qualities.\n\n\\- located on the island of Crete in the city of Heraklion\n\n\\- Underdog darby rivals against OFI\n\n\\- historic club with a 94 year history\n\n\\- crest and branding rooted in ancient olympic games\n\n\\- were kicked out of league football, deemed traitors against a right wing junta government of the 60s and 70s. Their rivals OFI raided their talent during this time.\n\n\\- they play in a decaying stadium originally built for the 2004 Olympic games with near 25,000 capacity.\n\nYou can set out to earn funds to buy your stadium, climb back into top-flight greek football, take down your rivals in OFI and become the kings of the island teams in the Mediterranean, building up your reputation to surpass the teams from Corscia, Sardinia, Mallorca.\n\nI might do this save again, i had so much fun in FM22 with it.",

I suppose it's fair to call them a \"fallen giant\" so it's even more vindicating to restore their reputation and former glory.",
            "Ok, I'm sure there aren't many American Baseball fans here, but if someone has any idea what this means, which European team do you think is the Seattle Mariners equivalent? \n\nThey are often lovable losers. Had some success at points throughout there 40+ year history, but have never won the World Series (championship) and are now the only team to have never even made it to the championship, but they have had teams that were totally capable of winning, but of course they lost when the fans had any expectation of them. \n\nI want to try and bring a team whose fans have never had much to root for to the top of league and compete for a European Cup, and a club who has some chance of realistically doing so. I would appreciate any suggestions.",

Polonia was dissolved due to bankruptcy in 2013 and was being rebuilt almost from scratch (5th tier). After 10 years of pain and changing owners they finally are back on track and are currently in the 2nd tier.

            "I can't see your team instructions so can't offer any advice on that. I can however offer advice on the player roles. First thing I'm noticing, your striker is the only player on an attack duty and they are in an advanced forward role. With the roles behind Werner, he is getting absolutely no help from the midfield. Can you explain the logic behind the two advanced playmakers on the flanks? Unless you are playing Lo Celso or Maddison, none of the other Spurs players are suited to the role of Advanced Playmaker. They are also not offering much in your attack. I'd recommend at the very least changing one to an attacking role and experiment with Inside Forwards or Wingers who will add some more directness and attacking impetus.\n\nThe rest of the roles could work but as to why your strikers are dropping stinkers.. it's probably because the attacking setup has them playing in a different time zone to the rest of the team. What I suggest doing when picking roles is to picture where they are going to be on the pitch in attack. The standard formation will determine where they'll generally be when defending and the roles will determine where they'll be when attacking.",

            "It looks pretty decent. Only issue I have with it is who are your scoring threats? I can only really see your striker as the consistent goal threat and even he is being asked to drop deep and be a creator in addition to scoring. Your BBM could be a threat if he arrives late in the box and scores good long shots. Your AP is asked to shoot less often and your Mezzala could get some shots off but they'll be from ineffective positions as he's asked to stay wider.\n\nObviously this could still work brilliantly in the game so just try it out but if you feel you are not scoring enough that could be the issue.",
            "Hey I'm just scrolling through this thread trying to learn, can you help me understand the thought process behind an Inverted Winger and an Inverted Wingback on the same side of the field?  To me that feels like they'd be trying to get to the same place in the attack, my gut would say one of them needs to be a standard winger to get width but I'm still fairly new so maybe this accomplishes something I'm not thinking of?",

            "Yikes. Yeah that was what I was worried about. 2.4 xG from 12 shots on target shows they were getting poor quality shots off. Because you set your team up to press high out of possession, when a team decides to sit deep, it can get difficult to break them down. What I tend to do in situations like that is drop the defensive and attacking line to invite the other team to step forward and allow me space to exploit",
            "That would have been a change I'll have suggested. I'd say try it out and see. Good you're getting goals from the DLF and IW though as that would have been my main issue but it seems to be working out for you.",

Do what Man City do and have Rice as a holding midfielder with two advanced midfielders ahead of him like Bellingham and Foden. They both understand the responsibilities to support Rice out of possession but it gets both Bellingham and Foden central whilst getting the best out of Rice.

There\u2019s a reason every time pep signs a player they spend months on the bench until they\u2019ve learnt the system and a national team manager only has a couple of weeks every few months and like 3 weeks before a tournament to get it done so whatever tactics they use do have to be fairly simple. The exception I guess would be 2010 era Spain where like 2/3 of the starting XI were Barcelona players but that\u2019s not the case for England.\n\nFor example if you have Stones step forward into midfield then you need your left back to move across and act as a left centre back in a situational back three. To do that you need to drill into them exactly when to move in or out of that back three and a left back who can perform in either position. Whilst that works with Ake or Gvardiol who\u2019ve been coached on it every single day by Pep, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d work suddenly asking Trippier to do it.",

Before his arrival, the Palermo squad was a world class team. They had won everything and i have set up a U18 and U20 system to make every transition seamless. I have also controlled U20 squad for every match so he could develop faster with mentoring and the world class facilities helping along the way.  \n  \n1) The key was to make him always take **penalties** and all of the **set pieces**. This in addition to playing him as a **sweeper keeper** on **attack** (more key passes i presume)\u00a0made it possible to get very often 8+ average rating with a lot of goals/assist. Having a world class defense ment that i didn\u2019t have to worry if he was the best GK in the world in terms of pure goalkeeping skill, they were able to help him keep those clean sheets  \n  \n2) There was a special training schedule that focused on goalkeeper development (as other players were mostly developed at that point) and set pieces/penalties , although only his technique improved and free kicks even got lower  \n  \n3) He didn\u2019t play in matches that were against harder opponents in away matches so it wouldn\u2019t lower his average rating except when playing in champions league. I would also rotate the squad fully so they wouldn\u2019t outshine my GK with goals/assist  \n  \n4) In the end he scored **29 goals** and made over **60 assists** (Serie A record with 18 in a Season) and had **38 POM** in 4,5 years (in all competitions)\n\nP.S. Newgens have a max value in certain attributes that can be generated when they are created. In my experiments the caps for Goalkeepers Penalties, Passing and First Touch go up to 12, Technique at 13, Free Kicks at 9, Corners at 6 and Crossing, Long Shots and Finishing at 3.\n\nSince for set pieces and penalties Technique and penalty taking were most important i looked for a 4\\*+ potential GK with at least 10 in both.

        "content": "So, we know that at the start every player has a CA and PA. And PA acts as a ceilling for a player. I understand that some players are more gifted than others and chances are that 16 years old from Brasil who is scoring 30 goals a season in first league should be able to develop more than 23 years old from Slovakian 3rd league who is just warming bench. I know that for player to reach his PA he has to train hard and play good consistently. But the problem is that if player is constantly training hard and performing well, while being well utilised in team, if his PA is low, he just wont become that good of a player.\n\nI feel that this design is bad from two perspective: both game design and following real life. From aspect of game design, it creates a transfer meta which result in everyone of us buying same players at the begining of careers knowing that certain players are \u201chidden\u201d gems (not so hidden if we all know them.  Sure, there is variety since there is a lot of teams and A LOT of players resulting in different games, its not like you can sign everyone with budget of 100k eur. \n\nOn the other hand, there are a ton of players that had not so promising start of the career and just bursted at the age of 27. Like if you need example, look at Jamie Vardy for example. You cant tell me anyone tought he had potential to become EPL top scorer one day while he was 18 y.o. I wont be listing similar cases because there is a thousands of cases like him.\n\nAnd then we have strangest things, like in one of my saves, Adam Armstrong was top scorer in EPL for me for three years straight, but since his CA wasnt that high (since his PA wasnt that high), I was getting offer for him in range of 20-35 milions. Like IRL City would be coming with 80 milion for him, while chelsea would be offering 150 milion (that club really got ruined fast).\n\nYou cant tell me that anyone tought that CR had 200 PA while he was 16 y.o. Or that anyone really tought he would become what he is now (or was few years ago). And we constantly hear that he is perfect example of hard work and sacrifice. Why cant we have that in a game?\n\nMy idea would be to have some system that works more as a booster to naturally talented players helping then reach higher stats faster and easier, and also helping them mantain their level more easily. But not as a ceiling. You nurtured your Lebanese left back for years, found a way to utilise him, spent years investing in him and that results in him playing good. Why cant he become on of best left backs in history of the game? \n\nI think it would be much better for two reasons: 1) we all get attached to some players and like investing a lot in them and it would be great to have them become really amazing, maybe going on to achieve greatness outsude of your club. 2) it would create variety and replayability in the game. Its not like there is none of that in game arleady, but more wouldnt hurt.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion on this, or maybe other ideas on how you would implement it differently.",

            "The CA/PA was probably implemented because anything more dynamic than that years ago would have caused performance issues in large databases. \n\nI agree it is time to overhaul it, I would simply favour CA ability only, with randomised development based on players age, professionalism, ambition etc. So you buy a 130CA 18 year old but you have no idea how they will actually pan out later down the line, even if they've got all the right personality traits.\n\nAll AI transfer pricing should be based around this as well.",
            "100% agree\n\nI had a CB at Juve who had perfect attribute split and was insane, my starter CB from age 17 to 20 while averaging 7.8 rating minimum.\n\nHe constantly had 3 star potential and I was getting offers for 5-7 mil for him. I assume his PA and CA was \"bad\" and every ai team knew that he was trash despite him being an absolute baller in my system\n\nInsane.",
            "This grinds my gears.\n\nPotential by the definition is how good the player can be. Your suggestions not only would break the balance of the game but also unrealistic.\n\nDiscussion about this always revolves Jamie Vardy which, first of all, is an exception not the rules even in real life. Second, it just means what we saw was Vardy's potential after all. We just failed to see it before. Not to mention FM already baked in a \"late-bloomer\" into a game which may allow us to see the Vardy-esque progression.\n\nThen, If every player that play many games with a good match rating can grow as a superstar, then everyone would be a superstar. It doesn't make any sense. Manchester United starts Scott McTominay week in week out, doesn't mean suddenly he grows into Roy Keane. He just did not have it in him.",
            "\"On the other hand, there are a ton of players that had not so promising start of the career and just bursted at the age of 27\"\n\nYou can see it this way, he always had the hidden PA to reach these levels he just didn't clicked until then (ex. Vardy as you said). So at a certain point he had a burst of CA gain to reach closer to his PA potential.\n\nThe thing is, you are not supposed to know the player's PA. Also there plenty of players that start a career being labeled as promising or wonderkids and not improving at all through their careers.",
            "And then there's YouTubers proving in experiments again and again that even scouts with perfect attributes will get some player's PA wrong. \n\nAnd the \"everyone buys the same 'hidden gems'\" argument: that's entirely on you. Don't watch those videos!",
            "I agree to an extent but also some players work very well in a system and there's a general awareness that that level of performance won't happen elsewhere. Leicester's title-winning side is a lazy example, but hear me out. The central defensive partnership they had of Morgan and Huth was fantastic in that system. And both players played extremely well individually and in combination. But neither had become an exceptional centre back - they just fit the system and the players around them very well. So Huth didn't become an \u00a380m centre back who could have bossed it beside John Terry at Chelsea, for example.\n\nTo offer a striker example, since yours is about Adam Armstrong, Kevin Phillips was a great centre forward in the contexts in which he played. But no big club was going to break the bank for him, because his skills worked in a particular system. Slightly more obscurely, to show what happens when those players do get big moves, Igor Protti was top scorer in Serie A in the mid-1990s, scoring about 26 of Bari's 35 goals all season as Bari got relegated. That earned him a move to Lazio, where he couldn't recreate it because he was suited to Bari's style and not that of a bigger club.",
            "I think you have a lot of missunderstandings about the game and some of them answer all your questions and critics.\n\nFirst the Vardy efect already exists on the game where a player will only develop when they are already 27 old instead of 19.\n\nSecond your thing about MC buying your player for 80 instead of 20/30 that is a problem with reputation sistem not on the player side.. there are a lot of examples out there of the best players on the world on the save being evaluted for peanuts just because they play on shit league or a bad club (and before you say your club isnt bad because you won the league for 3 years straight that doesnt matter unfortunaly....the reputation doesnt rise that fast and its been a problem for years and years but they cant fix it because they build their whole game on top of it soo changing it would break the game) instead of a reputation club.\n\nThird about the players potencial or current ability, some of the players already have dinamic potencial while creating a save (in my opinion all the players under 21 should have dinamic number instead of a fixed one thats why I use a editor data that does exatly that and that makes it always diferent players becoming the best in the world), But that doesnt even matter because you can literaly have a low current ability player become the best player in his role just because he has the best atributes in the right place and I think that might be another missunderstand you have....just because X player has higher CA than Y player doesnt mean X is better than Y and it could be the other way around, thats why atributes is always most important than CA or stars... Of course there are limits for example the odds of a guy with 100 being as good as a guy with 195 are Slim to none but a guy with 150 can totaly be better than a guy with 195.\n\nI think I answered every point but if I missed something let me know please.",
            "Altough i agree the PA doesnt work really nice, Vardy example is not great... players can overachieve in real life, and in the game, a 3 star PA player can be the EPL top goalscorer, in an one off season, just because Vardy was the top scorer doesnt mean he was the best striker in the prem, it s a team game. Thats why he stayed at Leicester and slowly fell out(also ageing), don t get me wrong, he was a good player still, but if you look at Kante for example, Mahrez... those 2 players are what you d expect to have a high PA. \n\n\nWhat are you describing with Vardy is just form, he was a 3* CA player in a good form. Even if he played amazingly, he was still just a good player, nowhere near being a superstar.\n\nYou want a dynamic PA based on how players are performing, but thats not what happens in real life. Poential is potential, and ability is ability.\n\nOusmane Dembele has a much higher ability, and had a huge potential when he was younger, than lets say... Rodrygo, Rodrygo is playing better, but that doesn t mean he has the same ability as Dembele. Ability and potential is about each individual player, there are players that have amazing ability but just don t fit or play well in a team, or multiple teams. It s fair to say Dembele hasnt fulfield his potential, but his individual ability is still better than Rodrygo s. \n\nYou are basically saying that Harry Maguire playing good for 5 straight seasons since he was 20, should get close to someone s CA and PA s ability that everyone knew from the get go he was gonna be a world class player. It just doesn t work that way, you can play amazing, doesn t mean you have better abilities than someone else.",

            "Actually CR was already taunted as a prodigy at 17. Though at the time it was thought that Quaresma and Fabio Paim would be better.\n\nFabio Paim had a trainwreck of a carreer, Quaresma was pretty solid, and for me he is one of the most technically gifted players to have played in and for Portugal. Problem w Quaresma is being a hot headed brawler. Perfect fit for FC Porto and the Turkish league, but perhaps a bit of a liability anywhere else.\n\nBut yeah, lets not forget that Ronaldo at 17 was a regular in a top 3 team in Portugal, at 18 humbled Man U to a point that he had to be hired the very next day after a friendly match, and at 19 he was already appearing at a National team level that reached (and lost) the Euro Final. If this wasnt revealing of a very high ceiling, then I dont know what is \ud83d\ude0b",
            "Yes. Another thing is, players don't learn from other players. For example, I get that I won't ever make it past the 4th Czech League, but I refuse to believe if I would train with Messi every day for the next let's say two years, I wouldn't improve at all. Now I understand it could be possibly abused a lot, but if it was implemented right, I think it would make a lot of sense going hand in hand with what you described.",
            "Agree on every level tbh. It would create a game which is 10x more dynamic and interesting",
            "100% agree but people will try to disagree by showing some example saying why this would be unbalanced, not realising it could easily be balanced and realistic if the developers just made smart decisions about how a feature like this could be implemented.",
            "That is absolutely correct. I have a cb at Real Valladolid whom I bought in the second division for pennies from Barca. Since then he helped us get promoted and qualify for european football 3 times in the last 4 seasons, whilst becoming club captain. However, since he has \"reached his potential\", he does not improve even a bit, despite consistently being my best cb in a back 3. And every season I bring in 1-2 better players to potentially take his spot, but he always outshines them. And those players are either former world beaters around 30 y/o, or young wonderkids, all with better attributes and CA than my main man. At this point he should be on par with Tah, Le Normand and some of those players IRL, but he's supposedly barely good enough to play in La Liga",
            "I think having no PA system would break the game in terms of realism. Having no cap on players' abilities would mean that I can have a team of Harry Maguires, Jordan Hendersons and Andy Carrolls playing like prime van Dijk, KDB and Messi week in week out. And that's just silly.\n\nThere's a reason why you don't see Lebanon even qualifying for the WC - they just don't have the ability. I can't understand why you think it's fun to have your Lebanese newgen have the same ability as prime Zanetti. Isn't it more fun to see your limited players performing way above their levels? Rather than having to actually see all 20s in their attributes?",
            "I've been finding the phenomenon in my West Ham save (biggest club in the world) where I get youth players through with 2-3 star potential, who absolutely kill it in the youth leagues and outperform all the best talents, but have no prospect to develop. I had this guy going at 2 goals a game in my U21's at 17 for a whole season, who ended up plaing League 1 for his senior career. He had a great personality, great trainer, but because of his potential ability he had no prospet to improve. If any 17 year old was scoring 2 goals a game in the U21's in real life he would be a world class talent. It is quite unrealistic,.",
            "I completely agree, and that\u2019s probably the biggest downside to this game. In most cases, PA is nothing more than a prediction for a player at a certain time.",
            "I agree with what you say and I\u2019ve been saying similar for years. The ceiling makes no sense and, like a lot of things in FM, is a relic of older versions of the game that worked then, but the game has evolved beyond now.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019d like to see is less accuracy from scouts with regards to potential. The same scout can take one look at player A & player B. They both play in the same position for the same club and are about the same age, but the scout can tell you right away that player A has 2*CA 4*PA and player B has 1*CA 5*PA. Player B might not end up developing into a 5* player, but you know for sure that player A won\u2019t and that if either of them are to become a star player, it\u2019s the one that currently isn\u2019t as good. There would be no way to know this from one scout report. It would take months of monitoring those players, tracking their development, finding out what weaknesses they\u2019re addressing and what strengths they\u2019re building on to know that the player who is currently worse has the capacity to turn out better.\n\nI also had a similar experience with Armstrong on FM23. I picked him up for \u00a380k from Southampton when I got promoted to the PL. He wasn\u2019t a regular starter for me, I signed him to use his pace off the bench and he was very effective, chipping in with loads of vital goals. In his last season he scored an injury time hat trick against Atletico in the CL (and won a penalty too) and the winner in the FA Cup final. He\u2019d bag 15 goals a season off the bench easily. By that point I had youngsters coming through, he was probably 29 and was down to the last couple of years on his contract. I managed to get \u00a315m from Everton for him, they barely played him and then shifted him onto Leicester in the Championship 6 months later for a pittance where he also didn\u2019t play very much.\n\nThe problem here is that while we can judge that a player\u2019s impact outweighs their CA, the game doesn\u2019t recognise that. Yet another relic of a simpler version of the game. He didn\u2019t even get an England call up because of his CA despite bagging late winners aplenty but was overlooked for players who rarely played for bigger clubs and didn\u2019t make the same impact when they were given the chance.",
            "Well this simple aproach would be the bast. I said some kind of boost purely in order for it to be able to give more advantage to really talented players, but I guess you could represent it trough character",
            "I 100% agree, it would be one thing if players always reached their PA but the game already has an abundance of factors preventing that from happening in many cases.\n\n\nI would much prefer doing away with PA, slightly nerfing development or add a flat cap on how much a player can improve in each attribute from generation (i.e. getting a better feel for the game doesn't prevent the player from putting on muscle). It's one thing that e.g. learning a new position takes development time and focus from improving other things (the game already does this) but defacto lowering the player's hard coded attribute ceiling just feels gamey in a frustrating way.\n\n\nYou also do away with attributes that are on their face useful being actively detrimental, such as finishing and decisions, because they eat a lot of CA for negligible benefit - though here the wonky match engine is also hugely at fault.",
            "I think a good way would be to keep PAs but allow it to be increased past its limit once CA has reached it assuming good performances.  Same way even 27-28yr olds improve when they're putting 7.30s. The issue is there needs to be a small hard cap because with every insane tactic you'd get 180+ CA players, maybe a +10 buffer would be enough.",
            "How much other teams will offer for players is much more down to reputation than it is ability.\n\nAnd 3 stars for a team like Juve is still a really good player.",
            "I think this is more a fault with the reputation system more than anything. Personally I think the game needs a potential system but the reputation system needs a serious overhaul as it is way too influential",
            "Exactly. While 3 stars at Juve isnt bad, if man played amazingly for seasons in real life he would be far better.",
            "Well said. Can't believe people want an arcadey system to make their players better. The point of potential is that not all players actually get better, despite playing and having all the best coaching etc. That's how it is in real life, and the game. You're supposed to find players that can actually develop, not just any rando that's good enough and turn him into a world beater, life doesn't work like that.",
            "I agree with this.\n\n\nThere are many more urgent things that need to be revamped than this. Some his PA players still tank\n there are late bloomers.\n\nThere are 130 CAs who are lighting up Prem .\n\nThis is not a concept that needs priority.",
            "Jamie Vardy is sure the most extreme example, but there are countless players that have similar-ish stories. Jarrod Bowen and Graziano Pelle randomly come to mind as less extreme examples but still.\n\nFM\u2019s baked in late bloomer thing is way too rare and not as effective/well done as it should be considering the frequency of Vardy-esque development happening irl.\n\nIf FM is meant to be a simulation of football, it should definitely have a system in place to account for Jamie Vardy-esque development to occur, with proper balancing of course. There\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be possible whilst still being realistic.",
            "Yeah I know that I am not supposed to know PA, and thats okay. I was foollowing thise stuff for few saves but decided it really ruins the game. But thats not the point here. As you said it, he always had hidden PA but just reached it later. And thats in real life, but not in FM. In every isnstance of FM he had hard coded PA which he couldnt surpass. If you pick up FM 11 and tried immitating that with Vardy, guess what, you couldnt do it. And that system hasnt changed since. And thats the problem I am talking about.",
            "You use the Leicester example yet Kante and Mahrez in that same team became Champions League winners. It\u2019s not as black and white as that.",
            "True that. There are players that work well in a system, players that are good anywhere, players that become better with old sge, players that are utter crap,\u2026.\n\nI just feel like player developement ceiling is somewhat too hard coded. I mean it is based on scouts knowledge, and while they are great at their job, scouts arent right all the time. And thats the beauty of the sport. And i feel like game isnt representing that well enough.",
            "Well reputation system is highly flawed and I know a lot of players agree. It isnt that slow in real life as it is in game. If any club won EPL for three years straight, dont you think it would have enough rep that it couldnt just be dismantled easily. We are not talking about one season wonder teams, but threepeating a \u201chardest\u201d league in the world. \n\nI do understand how stars and ratings work, mostly, but I had a lot of examples where player reached his potential at the age of 23, even tough he continued to excel for 10 more years, but his attributes couldnt improve since his CA matched his PA. And that happened when he was very young. While there is dynamic potential for the players, in my experience game hardly faitfully represents developement of players in real life. In reality it does slow down with age, but in my experience in game it just stops when they reach like 21-23 years. Look at Modri\u0107 for example. He was really decent player while in Tottenham, but man literally continued improving untill the age of 34. \n\nI did some experimentations with editor and I can tell you that it does make drastic changes if you play with players PA.",
            "What is ability if not long time form? I agree that there are good out of form players and bad in form players. But if yomeone is in form for five years, shouldnt he be considered good player? How could you say that someone who is in form for 10 years isnt a good player?",
            "I didnt say he wasnt deemed a talent, just that back than nobody knew what an animal he will become. And there wasnt a single scout who could tell you that man would go on to become a football player with most goals in history of the game. And in thise early games his potential shows that. He could become great player, but there wasnt a chance you could make him a player he was in his prime. Basicly guy was extremely talented+consitstent+hard working. And later two parts of that made his potential grow and made him able to surprass his potential.",
            "To be honest a lot of people here started defending systems that exist like they made them. Even tough half of them argue regularly that this system need improvement or that system need improvement,\u2026\n\nGame had very minor changes compared to FM 14 which was 10 years ago and thats what monopoly will do to things. I mean we have been paying for games that has very slight improvements. Snd then people here think they are smarter than average fufa player\u2026",
            "I think you misunderstood me. I didnt say that it should be easier to develop players and make them all superstars. Just that there should be a developement system where if you did everything right and stars aligned, there should be a possibility for your player to reach greatness. In a game right now there isnt ever a possibility. Its not something that can happen if player wasnt the chosen one at the start. \n\nReason you dont see Lebanon winning WC isnt because they are just not naturally talented. Its more of a situation that they are lacking stuff, infrastructure and time for all of that. If Lebanese had great academies, strong leagues and good coaches and managers, they would be performing far better than they are. I mean Brasilians arent some specific kind if humans that were bread to play football and are born that way. They play very competitivly since the day they were born and play it every day, enabling them to develop into amazing players they are.",
            ">I've been finding the phenomenon in my West Ham save (biggest club in the world) where I get youth players through with 2-3 star potential, who absolutely kill it in the youth leagues and outperform all the best talents, but have no prospect to develop.\n\nThis happens **all** the time irl",
            "Scouts do get that wrong though, so do coaches. Zealand has a video proving that star ratings lie.\n\nI signed 2 players based on scout reports on a receng save (same scout 15 scouting current / 17 scouting potential). Both scouted as 2.5 star current / 4 star potential. One has 1.5 star current / 3 star potential after signing and the other has 3 star current / 5 star potential.",
            "Yeha like at the most I could see a very small going over the PA like instead of 125 the player has 128c which actually I believe is already possible anywyas lol",
            "I have to disagree. There are thousands of players around the world and we keep on getting back to the same examples. It is like saying that feats like Kaiserlautern or Leicester should be more common in FM because those 2 things happened. Yes, they did, but in the history of the sport, they are blips. Same goes for Vardy / Bowen / Pelle... they are part of a handful of isolated cases. In Portugal / Brasil.i can also.recall Liedson, who at 21 or 22 was working on a supermarket, to become a leading goalscorer in the Portuguese league. Again, another exception to the many generations of strikers across all.clubs which had consistent carreer development.\n\nAt times it is not as much as being a late bloomer but more along the lines of \"not being found\".  If you want realism, perhaps it would be cool if the scouting rep9rts were completely wrong or very wrong to start with, and you would only start figuring out the real.attributes were once a player is 1.year or more in your team. Even Lindgaard has an amazong half season at West Ham that.made.him look.like the next big thing for the upcoming season. Even clubs with top.scouting capability bring players that turn out to be duds.\n\nIn fact, i would.say it is.more common to see failed transactions than the ones that work... and i am yet to see complaints from people on how unrealistic is for all players with good stats entering a nee team and having the time of their life from the get go.\n\nHell, look at Messi... even on his first season at PSG was a dud. (At PSG, where they are miles ahead from any competition in league 1!!!!)",
            "I mean yes you could. There is no way that Vardy would reach his maximum potential in the lower english leagues and obviously he would get a burst when finally reaching championship and PL levels of football and training.\n\nThis would happen in the game aswell. I had a player who was bought by psg at 25 from the lower french leagues and he just exploded in his attributes. I picked him up for peanuts before his reputation caught up.",
            "I didn't say it was black and white. I have some examples which possibly explain the OP's issue.",
            "I never said I didnt think the reputation sistem wasnt flawed mate...I have been preaching that for years now it is even worse in bottom leagues to top leagues saves.\n\nOnce again you missunderstand stuff...dinamic potencial isnt about continuing to grow or not its about not having a fixed number as PA meaning instead of a player having 175 in every save it will have a -9 which will mean he will have a random value between 150 and 180 meaning in some saves he could be a one of the kind wonderkid and in another he will just be a good young player...\n\nAbout the evolving at later stage I will repeat that is already a thing on the game where a player wont develop much at 18-21 but will instead develop when they reach 28 ofcourse its not commom because it isnt common in real life and no Modric is not a example he was all ready top class at Tottenham there is a reason Real payed that much money for him in that year where him and Bale were the best of that team along Abdebayor and Walker....\n\nI am sure you did some editor experience but I can bet you I can show you a player with lower CA that is better than a 200 CA player, unfortunaly I am not at home but when I get there I will send two pictures and you can judge as yourself..",
            "It's been tested. Players continue developing until they are 26-28 actually they just have the most explosive development from the ages of 16-18 and 18-21.",
            "Ofc they can be good, but you want them to be superstars, or better than they are... Eriksen played good for 10 years, is he anywhere close to Modric? Or KDB?  No. Eriksen is a 4* 4* while the other 2 are  5* 5*...doesn t matter Eriksen outperforms them for 3 4 seasons, his ability isnt at the same level. \n\nNeymar, is arguably the most gifted player ever, the things he can do with the ball, nobody can, the ability he has as an INDIVIDUAL PLAYER, nobody has. Yet he still got outperformed by a lot of players. Neymar has everything, yet Messi outclassed him. Ronaldo outclassed him, Mbappe, Jude will when it s all said and done. That still doesn t mean that Neymar s ability isnt higher than the ability of those players. \n\nNot playing at the same level as them, can be because of various reasons ( determination, injuries, work ethic, personality) but ability is ability. Transalting that ability onto the field in different teams and set ups is a different discussion.\n\nMy point is, lesser players can play better than better players, but that doesn t mean they are better players, and have the same ability. \n\nAnother example, Bonnuci, good player that performed amazingly for decades, but you will still swap him in a heartbeat for the likes of Sergio Ramos, VVD, Rio Ferndinand etc, Even tho he played decades at the top level, winning everything he could have won, playing great, his ability still doesnt come close to those players ability. He has got more acomplishments than VVD and played at the top level way more than VVD, but he s nowhere near the player VVD is. \n\nVVD is what you want to happen in the game, but the problem is, VVD had the ability always, he was never a just a good player, he was just missread by teams and scouts, he always had the ability to be a world class CB, while your guy in FM doesnt, he just plays good.",
            "OP. If the players are playing well, why are you concerned with the stupid green number not increasing? \n\nYou need to play attributeless or pseudo attributeless at least once because your core complaint with the current system is that a player who has reached their PA at a very young age by playing well and consistently suddenly stops developing. If they are still playing well with their current attributes what is the problem? You don't need a team filled with 190 CA wonderkids to win the Champions League, just players who are good with their current roles good dynamics and a good attacking tactic.\n\nThinking IRL I think someone like Guirassy has reached his \"PA\" he scored 28 goals in the Bundesliga last season he has only scored more than 10 goals in a season once before in his whole career, according to you his stats should increase but I don't think so. He is not any faster, stronger or smarter. His touch didn't improve he's not suddenly become an insane off-the-ball runner. The ball is just hitting the back of the net more, that and the team around him is better too",
            "If CR7 come through your youth intake your scout would give him a potential of 4.5 stars or something. Same with if you're a different team scouting young CR7. All you know is \"high potential\" as indicated by the stars, but the stars are inaccurate and there will be dozens of other wonderkids with similarly high rating by your staff. Just because you use the editor to see PA doesn't mean that SI should balance it around you seeing things you're not supposed to.",
            "But then i think that the way for the game to have it right would be that not all players originally marked as wonder kids would actually hit their potential but would fall short - which is actually a lot more common.\n\nAs an example, look at most u-16 to u-20 national teams, and you will find many that will not become even top division players.\n\nIt is a lot more common to have players not living up to their perceived potential than the other way around.\n\nRememeber Giovanni dos Santos, Bojan, Carlos Vela, Adriano, hell- the aformentioned Quaresma and Fabio Paim, Halilovic, Pato, Ganso, Robinho, Balotelli - even Odegaard at some point (glad he found space to get back on track at Arsenal). Jadon Sancho also comes to mind.... i think we can come up with a few examples of players that exceeded expectations and took the world by storm... but we can spend nights upon nights talking about players that never were.",

            "If player had PA of 150 and CA of 100 at age of 16, reached 150 before he is 22, in this game thats just where he will stay. And if a player had such an amazing developement you are telling me that he will for sure stop at that age in real life? That there is literally 0 chance that he could continue his amazing developement. Its not that they stop developing at certain age just, its combination of developement slowing down and players stoping their developement once they reach their PA. Can you tell me Lewandowskis PA in FM 09? Ronaldos in CM 01/02? And so on and so on. In thise games these players literally cant develop to reach their abilities in their prime like they did in real life. And nothing has changed about it now.",
            "It doesn\u2019t have to be that extreme, with proper balancing and intelligent coding it should be easy to implement a system with realistic development to account for players like Vardy and the like.",

Would you still say that he hasnt improved, its just that ball is hitting the back of the net more often?\n\nOn the first note, atributeless and pseudo atributeless? Dodnt know about that, can you describe it to me?",
            "It is \"predetermined\" from certain point of view, we as humans just don't always know it yet. \n\nAlso even then, irl scouts give players grades based on talent and room for improvement they see and not necessarily good performances alone.",
            "Can you say for sure that their development will exceed that though. Obviously the game doesn't simulate real life as well as it could but you're argument is basically that players can outperform their ability and the game still recognizes that they are outperforming their ability and doesn't change their evaluation. This isn't entirely correct though to begin with.",
