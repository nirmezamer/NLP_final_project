            "Looking back, another mistake for Drake was entrusting DJ Akademiks to be his go to media guy and main media mouthpiece during the beef. One of the main focal points of this entire exchange was the conversation around cultural capital and credibility in hip hop and black culture. DJ Akademiks is someone who has such a horrible track record in hip hop when it comes to using his public platform. From the war in chiraq coverage, to his endless beefs with others in hip hop, and apparent inability to act as an objective observer of the events it is clear that Drake wanted to leverage Akademiks public platform as one of his main tools of propaganda. However, entrusting a goofball to be on your team who makes a fool of himself regularly and is not really respected in culture didn\u2019t benefit Drake in the long run. In fact, Akademiks having a meltdown every time Kendrick dropped only further cemented how bad things were getting for Drake in the public eye. \n\nIf Drake is smart, he should stop leaking info to Akademiks. It serves no purpose for him and he honestly never needed Akademiks in the first place.\n\nEdit: also, the more I think about it akademiks is really a liability. He\u2019s already crashed out too many times before and he has an ongoing civil suit over a rape case pending. If drake continues to latch on to Akademiks as his media guy, Ak is guaranteed to have a major fumble that disadvantages him somehow. People like that always self destruct and bring others down with them, I\u2019ve seen it happen too often. Drake should cut ties now while nothing major is on the line.",

            "Man, I hope this west coast unity thing actually lasts. As someone who has music industry friends on the west coast, I\u2019ve been very happy to see a lot of the modern artists in that region get such a big look but there still lies a lot of obstacles ahead towards bringing that entire scene to prominence again. Mainly, the way gang politics work out there. A lot of the collaborative nature that helps movements occur in hip hop is made difficult in LA because there are so many rival factions that beef with each other. For example, Schoolboy Q danced around the topic on his Drink Champs interview but part of the reason why Q never worked with Nipsey on a song despite them both respecting each other as men and artists is due to the fact that both of their sides of the crips had an active beef with each other. The street politics are also the reason that Drakeo the ruler got killed and why he wasn\u2019t able to be recognized or paid tribute to at the pop out show.\n\nDeveloping more infrastructure and opportunities for these guys to succeed going forward is key to maintaining peace. The pop out show is a wonderful start but it needs to be the beginning of a much longer term plan in order to keep the positive energy going. These artists having individual success is one thing but there needs to be an ecosystem in place that allows not just them but other members of their communities to profit/benefit as well. That\u2019s why Nipsey was so important, because he was figuring out ways to actually put other members of his neighborhood and community into positions to succeed. With nip dead, a lot of the progress has stalled and a lot of people who meant well have had no real opportunities available. \n\nThis is also important because a select minority of artists getting opportunities while everyone else is still stuck breeds resentment that eventually spills over into violence again and then the cycle just repeats itself. If only a few people benefit financially, it places targets on their backs and obviously no one wants that to happen. \n\nIt\u2019s a very complex situation which is what Kendrick was alluding to at the end of the livestream when he was giving his little monologue but I really hope that it all works out.",

Im not black (im brown), but from what i understand, it also has something to do with Drake being lightskin/mixed, so it makes it even in worse taste to say that about Kendrick, who is darker. It is a rap beef, so i cant blame Drake for doing it. It was a bad call though, cause it set up the Kendrick response to make Drake even more disliked for mentioning freeing the slaves, and Kendrick made it into positive for himself. I think Kendricks response was clever in that way.",

You can also pretty easily just throw on a Wayne track or two and keep it moving, or listen to a ton of them in a row in a playlist without necessarily caring about which album or mixtape they came from. Sometimes I prefer that.\n\nKendrick, I usually am listening to his whole records if I'm listening to him because his work is a lot more holistic. I think you could make the argument he's generally more well-rounded, he's a great storyteller and good actually structuring songs. He is also obviously an excellent rapper, but he's a different *kind* of excellent rapper IMO. \n\nSo it's a tough call. Gun to my head I'd probably pick Kendrick, but it's really close.",

My ONLY attachment to him is through his music so it\u2019s hilarious to see you go through all this effort to discredit it when so many people love it. Get a fucking life.

I was a young man. There's nothing wrong with that. You can't expect a young person to have any success in adulthood if you treat him/her like a child right up until they turn 18. It's supposed to be a gradual transition. There is a point in life where you are no longer a child but not quite a full grown up either. 16 year olds can drive, get a job, many of them drink and smoke, have sex, commit crimes, etc. That's not a little kid anymore. That's a young adult.",

Sure 19 year olds aren\u2019t finished growing fully, and sure 3 years isn\u2019t a big deal when a 25 year old is dating a 28 year old, but there\u2019s a vast difference in the maturity, emotional intelligence, and manipulatability of a 16 year old than a 19 year old. 16 year olds are naive and generally think they\u2019re untouchable. A 19 year old who is willing to date a 16 year old (which makes them straight up weird, and a predator) knows that, and uses it to their advantage.\n\nWe didn\u2019t decide 18 year olds are adults arbitrarily. We decided 18 year olds are adults because they\u2019re mature enough to start handling adult life and concepts. A 16 year old is not. That\u2019s why people are arguing over whether 16 year olds are even actually old enough to drive, whereas nobody questions a 19 year old.\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t have experience with comparing the differences in these ages, and giving your opinions on something you\u2019re wrong about is not a good idea because then it leads to situations like a 19 year old adult having sex with a 16 year old kid.\n\nYou keep avoiding the question of would you let your child date an adult.",

            "> It's not like Canada just magically skipped out on being anti-Black\n\nI know, but it's just not the same. And the fact that you bring up historical anti-blackness will help make my point. \n\nThe important racial disparities are material, these are the ones actual serious people studying racism care the most about. Take the canonical example: you redline, people don't get out of poor neighborhoods and never build wealth. This causes a cascade of issues that maintains even if you remove whoever the original racist redliner was. This is why social sciences' definition of systemic racism has moved past dispositional racism and, sometimes, even direct policy.\n\nThere is a poor underclass of black people that actually suffer what we consider \"systemic racism\". They're the ones that are poor, have bad health circumstances and get shot. I would say most of the \"problem\" of racism is really about them, and attempts to fight this in elite spheres are near worthless (\"representation\" doesn't change this, it just lets one black elite get money. Better off kids sitting on a campus saying \"do something about racism\" may lead to the school getting rid of a hall named after some racist or whatever, but it won't change it either)\n\nIn the case of blacks in Canada, specifically Canadian universities, we are not talking about this underclass. We are not even talking about the wannabe middle class. *Or* the \"original\" blacks of Canada from the British colonial period.  These people are the upper middle to upper classes of their country of origin in Africa (usually Nigeria). This was especially true when I first arrived: they would simply have never been let in if they couldn't pay the huge Canadian out of state tuition fees. I myself was rejected at first until my dad got a diplomatic job in the US that placed him in the upper middle class.\n\nThese people completely skipped all of the stuff an American/Canadian black might get trying to move from poverty to middle class. They were born upper (lots of LV belts and expensive shit at the boarding school I went to), they don't have any connection to the poor blacks of Canada, or the ones who descend from the ones the British let in. They don't have any connection to any set of policies that shaped material circumstances like redlining. \n\nEven worse, they are an absolute cashcow for the schools. I've seen how many have become corrupted by the money since they pay so much more (Conestoga was in the news for stuffing its classes and basically killing grading to let people pass). A Canadian uni degree is basically a pass into permanent residence (or at least a post-graduate work permit that buys you a few years to get pr). So they get to squeeze us for it. On the flip side: they cater to us too. \n\nFinally, my subjective experience: I was in that campus. I was in that city. I know it. I didn't find them credible at the time for a reason \n\n>And First Nations are in fact not \"your Blacks\", you can't just slot people in like that\n\nYou shouldn't be able to do it but that's my point: that's exactly what they're doing now. They're just slotting in blacks as our \"minority we harmed and need to come to terms with\", kind of like for Americans how the most important set of race relations to fix is the ones around black and white. It is what it is: everyone says they want to fight racism but for obvious reasons (size, history, the depth of the problems) you don't see the same sort of marches for Asian Americans, or even Stop Asian Hate. \n\nBut, my point is, if you're going to have that sort of minority at all in Canada, it should be the First Nations people. For a variety of reasons, including Canada specific ones  like treaty obligations to bands (and the political consequences of their mobilization - see the issues  with pipelines and such)\n\nEither you don't have that slot at all, or you fill it appropriately.",
