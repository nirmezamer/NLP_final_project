            "Perfect day for brainstorming. I have a book I just started writing (never publish, just personal short-ish stories) and I'm also looking for recommendations. Tried making a post, but apparently the auto-mod said they don't like it, and to list it here.\n\nI haven't read any *current* books in quite a long time, and I'm currently trying to get some inspiration of how to structure things a bit more clearly and eloquently.\n\nI'm curious of 1) which \"older\" author is your favorite as far as their writing style, 2) favorite \"newer\" author, 3) a good book or series that you find to be very well written.\n\nIt drives me *insane* when a book feels like it's written for a.... different audience. I grew up on books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Louis L'Amour, C.S. Lewis while also stumbling across Nora Roberts more recently.\n\nI like SciFi and Fantasy, and I'm wanting to branch into more adult books to see how things are done in books these days. I've written plenty of adult content for others, but never cared for the ones I attempted. They seem like they are childish in a way; inexperienced with a fantastical (though wildly impractical or unrealistic) idea of what is happening. \n\nI'm not old, I just hate moderate to piss poor effort in writing quality. Takes me completely out of the world I'm trying to get into.",
            "I struggle with names and titles. Do any of you have resources you use to help with that?",
            "How could I wrote someone who's pretending to be someone else, a good person who's funny, likeable, the person who they've always wanted to be etc when they're actually someone who's deeply calculative and a good liar.\nThey see themselves as the person who they pretend to be but deep down they know that they aren't, they ideally want someone who would accept them for who they are.\nI'm really thinking about how to show this kind of character, for example, their thoughts being extremely to the point and shrewd while their speech is extremely long and comedic.\nAny ideas?",
            "Dialogue or summary, which is the best? I am struggling with this dilemma. The situation is this: A secondary character will reveal some lore of the world and the political situation. However, I can't choose between a good long dialogue or a much quicker analytical summary. Any Advice?\n\nThis lore is relevant to the story",
            "FRIENDS-TO-ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS\n\nHow soon should I introduce the fact that childhood friends turned enemies are actually fated to be lovers?\n\nFor context, (werewolf novel) WMC was brainwashed into a revolution as a young child, and was subsequently taken into hiding with her future LI. They grew up as friends in hiding, LI eventually finds out she was the \u201cleader\u201d of the revolution, immediately hates her. Later they find out they are mated, he ends up rejecting her and takes off for years. She ends up proving her loyalty to the wolf-King and is given a pardon and is informed the Moon Goddess is now going to repair the rejected bond rather than give her a new mate. Now LI is back and they haven\u2019t seen each other since the bond was fixed, but I have to bring them back together soon for a mission.\n\nI\u2019m on Chapter 16, bond was fixed in Chapter 12-ish, after some heated arguments between WMC and LI. Should I just bite the bullet and do it in this chapter? It feels like too much to put in just a couple of chapters \ud83d\ude05",
            "Was going to put this in its own post because it's a rather long question, but got a warning to put it here when I added the title, so sorry in advanced for how long this is. I wrote the post before already, so I'll just put it here I suppose.\n\nI am writing a cultivation novel and would like some help figuring out what items would be necessary to bring a person back to life in my story. The character who's going to be bringing this person back to life is a peasant who's hoping to raise a martial master from his grave and make them mentor him. He is, of course, an idiot, if that's relevant, but I need him to successfully perform this task.   \n  \nThis is relevant because he likely wouldn't have access to any crazy artifacts that you might see an established cultivator struggle to obtain. It's possible for him to stumble across some sort of part or egg or something of a legendary beast by chance, because I don't want it to be super easy to raise the dead in this world, but he needs to manage it in the beginning of the story. I don't want to have too many details beforehand about him obtaining those items because this resurrection takes place at the very beginning of the story and the plot can't get properly started unless the story begins with him in the cemetery performing said ritual. Him going through a bunch of hardship in the beginning that he likely wouldn't survive in his state would sadly be way too awkward to fit into the exposition.\n\nDoes anybody know some items that could be used for this ritual, or any items he could stumble across by rare (yet convenient, lol) chance? Usually there would be some big arc building up to a revival in cultivation stories, but the whole point of this is that the protagonist, desperate for a mentor in the beginning of the story, resorts to raising the dead, only to revive the wrong person and have to deal with the annoying person he accidentally brought back instead. I'm open to having somebody pulling the strings behind the scenes that gave him these items, but ultimately my reason for asking this is because I have no idea what kinds of items would usually be necessary for this in a cultivation story or how they would be used.",
            "What did i miss ?",
            "Not sure where this would go, so apologies if this belongs in a different thread, but...Does anyone know if there's a database for all the writing/publishing resources? Like one place where authors can see things like resources for promoting your book, or resources for creating ads to sell your book, etc?",
            "Is there such a thing as a mystery writer's wiki or database where one can look up certain details? For example something such as how much of a certain substance would it take to kill a person? Looking for book contents and I feel googling it would put me on some sort of watch list.",
            "please share your honest reviews: [https://www.wattpad.com/1454249894-my-fantasy-boyfriend-chapter-1-wish](https://www.wattpad.com/1454249894-my-fantasy-boyfriend-chapter-1-wish)\n\n  \nmy first writing",
            "I've been working on a story for a good couple years. It's about a teenager named Nico who gets thrown out for being gay and having to figure out how to survive in the real world without being ready for it. It's also a deep dive into mental health and a real look into what it's like to struggle with it. It's a heavy story and it throws you headfirst into it from the start as I liked the idea of starting at the peak of the central conflict and going from there. The story is first-person and told through Nico's eyes for most of it. The way I have it planned out is due to the events of chapters 1 and 2 (I don't wish to share it publicly right now as it's incredibly dark and definitely requires trigger warnings.) Nico ends up at his friend Charlie's house and falls asleep by the end of chapter 2. I did this for a few reasons as chapter 3 is a series of memories told through him dreaming to explain how him and his mom got to where they end up by the start of the story, as well as explaining that she's kinda always been like that and only gotten worse unfortunately. It also is used because chapter 4 switches POVs to Charlie's as he has to go get what is left of Nico's stuff before the mom just outright gets rid of it. \n\nI have an idea of how I want to communicate it because switching in third-person is one thing but I know it's way harder in first-person. I was just wondering if this is a good way to do this as I've never done it before. At the end of chapter 2 before Nico falls asleep, Charlie shows him to his room and they talk. Something along the lines of:\n\n\"This is your room. If you need anything, I'll be right across the hall. The worst is over, I promise.\" \n\nAnd then Charlie closes the door and leaves Nico to his own devices. \n\nMy idea for starting chapter 4 is to write that scene again, but through the eyes of Charlie. So instead of Nico describing him, it'd be Charlie describing Nico. And then to show that it's not Nico's POV, when the door closes, we follow Charlie rather than stay with Nico like we did at the end of chapter 2. The point of why we go to Charlie's POV, rather than stay in Nico's is that when he goes to get Nico's stuff, him and the mom get into it. And after all that she's done from the first three chapters, I wanted to give a scene early on where someone finally tells her off and gets away with it as like a reward, if that makes sense. It also makes sense story wise because when she dies, I want her to be long gone because I want Nico's reaction to feel real. Especially with how destroyed their relationship is and how out of nowhere it's supposed to be.\n\nDefinitely want to know what y'all think. I know switching POVs in FP isn't usually advised but it has a purpose in my story and I just wanna make sure I get it right. Thanks for reading :)",
            "So I had this shower thought: Why do SciFi/Fantasy book writers, think that \"bigger is better\" (compensating much)? I kind of miss the old days of like Pratchett (Discworld) or Asimov (Foundation, or more general all the robot stories). These were \"normal\" (ca. 80k wordcount) books, that tell cool stories without much fluff. Riordian, Lewis, Leguin, they all managed to create compelling worlds without getting into 300k territory. \n\nIt even would let you explore other themes, subgenres, styles within your books. Look at Discworld, you get to experience the same world through so many lenses. A far better exploration (because like in real-life, everyone sees the world different). And as I said, you could make a book a romantic novel, the other a thriller, and so on.\n\nBonus: You actually get to finish your books much quicker (looking at your Martin) and with less stress (I think Sanderson recently said, that he is glad, the he finally finished his latest Stormlight Archive book). From a market standpoint its also better, because you get more money (as there are more books). And the publishers are also more likely to buy your books.\n\nMaybe they think: Well Tolkien did it? But let's be honest, some of the stuff is boring (at least in my eyes). I don't need to know the name of every tree in the forest :-) And even he managed to keep it short. He managed to tell more story in 3 books then Sanderson did in one book of Stormlight Archive (maybe a bit too harsh?) :-)\n\nOr maybe it's just me that does not like to carry around these heavy books.\n\nWhat's your oppinion?",
            "I'm a comic book kinda guy",
            "1) I love Mary Higgins Clark, and 2) I can appreciate a lot of the newer YA Authors (although some have some pretty weird issues going on with themselves personally) but I\u2019ve been branching out to intentionally include more non-white writers into my collection. Adeyemi is a GREAT author, as is S.A. Chakraborty! 3) The Daevabad Trilogy was FANTASTIC, and I liked the Wheel of Time series, however it is a little slower (think Tolkien in the writing style).",
            "Louis L\u2019Amour, I know he is commonly considered subpar for his pulp works and formulaic westerns but he\u2019s made some excellent reading. Just began reading The Walking Drum and The Haunted Mesa (westerns might not be the only formulaic thing!)",
            "Fictional or as real as possible ?",
            "I use a name generator, honestly https://www.behindthename.com/random/ \n\n I\u2019m unsure of where my world is taking place, but I almost attempted to create my own language, and it was immediately overwhelming \ud83d\ude05 at this point, my characters have names from basically everywhere and I\u2019ve developed some of them to fit their name meaning rather than the origin of the name. \n\nAs far as titles, I\u2019d just wait until you flesh out most of your book to see what may fit best.",

            "My goal for my current fantasy is 100K words, but this is also my first full-fledged novel, so I\u2019m allowing myself some grace. \n\nBut as a reader, I really appreciate having the details spelled out for me so I can envision the world with clarity. I want to FEEL the moss on the centuries-old castle, TASTE the gunpowder and blood on the battlefield. I like the sensory input. And when it\u2019s a WHOLE NEW WORLD, of course there is a lot that may be different, but sometimes **important later on**.

            "It\u2019s a sci-fi with just humans so I\u2019m looking at pretty realistic names. I have Javi and Mads so far, although I\u2019m still on the fence about Mads. I have been using Kayly and Zoe as placeholders for two other characters. The names I just pulled from my inspiration source and have been replacing them as I find something I like. I have replaced two, but Kayly and Zoe still fit the characters so well and I can\u2019t find something with the same vibes. I could leave it. The story is pretty different from my inspiration source but there are still some key elements that are similar and I worry it\u2019ll be too distracting or whatever to have the names in common too.",
            "Thank you! I haven\u2019t been able to find a name generator for realistic names and reading baby name books was a slog! I\u2019ll check this out!",

It was meant to be a surprise, a dropped bomb. I\u2019m **hoping** that the readers see their animosity for each other as unrelated to the repaired bond until I reveal it. But I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ve waited TOO LONG. If I reveal this right now, I\u2019ll be approx 1/4 of the way through my book.",
            "Great plot for Kung Fu Hustle 2 ... love it ! lol",
            "I feel you. I don't mind having the world described. It is more on how far authors may go. I don't need to know the whole backstory of who made the gunpowder in the first place and that the wife of the son of he maker, is now pregnant with twins. :-)\n\nI think there's a fine line of it being coloring and not adding much to the story overall (if I forget what you have written, because the payoff is 200k words later, what's the point) and being an immersion into a new world.\n\nI've enjoyed the Greenbone-Saga much more than Mistborn. There was less extranous fluff in the Jade books. Or at least that's what I felt. Sanderson has the tendency to repeat himself. Sometimes even in the same paragraph.",
            "One trick of mine. Don't tell anyone.\n\nFavorite movie... end credits... but not the actors... there's a bunch of names of people who worked on the movie. Shorthen them, switch them, have them in a stew lol\n\nGo wild !\n\nThanks for keeping it to yourself. Have fun.",
            "No problem! I honestly LOVE this one, especially since you can fiddle with the filters. I also love some of the funny name combos it spits out (Herald Gangsta Daddy is the top fav currently).",
            "then maybe just a moment of ... understanding between them ... before the reveal. I think the readers have to see it may be possible. \n\nSo, you're thinking before the end of the mission ? ... or after ? ... or the mission is about them and their \"fates\" ?\n\nHmmm? \n\n;)",
            "I can definitely understand that. The fine line of \u201cthis is how this author wants me to view their world\u201d and \u201cthe details are now obscuring the plot of the story\u201d.",
            "Herald Gangsta Daddy is fantastic!",
            "My current script is that the MMC is talking to the \u201cseer\u201d and being told of the WMC\u2019s new status as part of the pack and of her being resolved of \u201cher crimes\u201d. Sort of allowing the MMC the opportunity to realize that everyone else is forgiving her and moving on, so maybe he should too.\n\nNot sure if you know much about werewolf \u201cmate bonds\u201d but they snap into effect upon seeing one another, and are solidified by marking one another. So it will need to be before the mission, because he will realize the mate-bond is there as soon as he sees her. \n\nThe mission is an actual mission. WMC has gotta stop another \u201crevolution\u201d! But MMC is gonna go with them.",
            "Sorry, i'm a little confused. They already knew each other. But they didn't know about their mate bond ? (before becoming enemies)\n\nOr is the bond decided by some authority, then they see each, they know, they accept and they mark each other ?\n\nNot trying to poke holes, it's for my own education ;)",
            "So the mate-bond are determined by the Moon Goddess and can only go into effect after they turn 18. However, they get their wolves at 16. \n\nWMC and MMC grew up together (they are about 8 months apart, her being the older one), and he didn\u2019t know she was the \u201cleader\u201d of the revolution until she got her wolf at 16, which revealed who she was. He immediately shunned her, because he felt lied to, his best friend of roughly 4 years was the person who caused him a lot of hardship.\n\nThen, on his 18th birthday, he saw her and they recognized their mate-bond. He rejected her privately, and it actually almost killed her. After that, he took off for schooling abroad, basically. No one besides them knew they were ever mates.\n\nNow they are 21 and 22, and hoped to have \u201csecond chance mates\u201d. The Moon Goddess has decided that their mate-bond will be reinstated instead, which means it will be much like how it was the first time. When they see each other, their mate-bond will be recognized.\n\nETA: They grew up IN HIDING together after the failed revolution and she was given a different name. They did not know each other personally before the revolution.",
            "Makes sense. \n\nSo you have to reveal the \"renewal\" before the mission... or at the moment they see each. \n\nWhich changes how they react to each other, in one case or the other. Which is the most interesting for you should be the most interesting for the readers. \n\nMaybe something happend during the mission that prove the Moon Goddess right.\n\nYou got this !"

            "\\*Title: The Interloper, Chapter 1\n\n\\*Genre: Hard sci-fi\n\n\\*4245 words\n\nHi, there, I'm a newcomer here. I'm typically someone with more of an interest in science and philosophy, but enjoy speculative fiction as a vehicle to explore these concepts.\n\nSo, here's the first chapter of a story I'd like to receive feedback on. Given that this is hard sci-fi, the focus of a lot of my effort has been trying to make sure that the events in the story align as much as possible with current understanding of science and principles of logical consistency. However, I've also tried to make sure the writing is up to snuff - I've thrown away a few previous stories due to thinking they weren't delivered in a satisfying way, and the only reason why this has been posted here is because it meets my personal criteria for readability.\n\nI'm not looking for any specific feedback. While I would certainly appreciate pointers on where the plot deviates from believable scientific speculation or generally just strains credulity, I'd hugely appreciate (and am mostly expecting) feedback on aspects such as how the prose feels and flows, on how understandable the writing is, and whether the dialogue feels authentic enough.\n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRUve1NXcBEBN6eKt5VrXY-CnToFxnJh9e8yOZ\\_LYZk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRUve1NXcBEBN6eKt5VrXY-CnToFxnJh9e8yOZ_LYZk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nExcerpt:\n\nTwo months, fifteen days, twenty-one hours, and counting. That\u2019s how long I\u2019ve been here, dying in slow motion, my body slowly rotting from the inside long before I\u2019ve even had the chance to take my last breath. My final resting place will be a twisted, hyperbaric coffin named *Proteus,* forged from metal, glass and concrete, entombed deep in the waters of a lifeless abyss.\n\nThe luminaire assemblies that line the walls of the hab gradually flicker on and illuminate the chamber in a sickly off-white glow, mechanically simulating a diurnal cycle for all its doomed inhabitants.\n\nIn the station, an ever-present soundscape practically smothers us, heavy and ominous and oppressive. The very walls that protect us from the elements scrape and buckle incessantly like a soda can under pressure, as if they could crumple inwards and crush us at any moment. In the endless, murky depths outside, the hydrothermal fields produce a subtle, low rumble that seems to emanate from somewhere in the very core of the world, like a massive sleeping god under our feet only kept alive by its host body\u2019s eccentric swings from periapsis to apoapsis and back again. Softly stirring as it\u2019s unwittingly press-ganged into providing the energy necessary to sustain *Proteus* and keep it from falling apart.\n\nI hear Whitlock faintly stirring in the bunk underneath me. The bed creaks as he slowly, gingerly sits up and begins to vomit into a bucket, choking and heaving and gasping as the contents of his stomach unceremoniously escape his body. Once the retching is over, there\u2019s laboured breathing and a soft, low thud; the sound of a head being rested against a bunk pole.\n\n\u201cHey, you okay down there?\u201d I call to him, my voice raspy and worn.\n\nNo response.\n\nStill extremely tired, sore and unwilling to get up, I close my eyes and try to ignore the faint glow behind my eyelids, letting the deep, all-consuming drone lull me back to sleep. Slowly, I lose awareness of my limbs and then my body, and very nearly manage to fall into a state of blissful oblivion until a quiet thumping and rustling emerges from near the door of the module, breaking me out of my hypnagogia.\n\nI blearily crack open an eyelid, and strain through the harsh fluorescent glare to see who it is. It\u2019s Spivey putting on his uniform and shoes, getting ready for the day ahead so he can pretend to be useful.\n\nOf the lot of us, he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s bothered to act like the mission still matters. When he\u2019s not doubled over in horrible agony and hacking up a lung, he conducts routine structural checkups, analyses sediment samples near hydrothermal systems, collects data on the topography of the seafloor, and performs a million other experiments that no one will remember.

Jody, seven beers deep, clung to Reese\u2019s shoulder as they stumbled forward. Reese, ever the square, was sober. The group were walking down Santa Lucia Street, cackling at one of Sean\u2019s stories about the time he and his ex had misread a road sign during a day trip and it became a week trip.\n\n\tWhen he finally found his breath again, Edgar wiped his eyes dry and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cMiguel, it\u2019s been real, man.

For months, he\u2019d sweated under his breastplate while mosquitoes weaved between the gaps in his armor to bite him.  But not anymore.  A late summer snow had stemmed the flying little demons and made wearing his silver armor comfortable, rather than stifling.  It\u2019ll be a good night for a spirit hunt, he thought as he strode down the snowy path with a spring in his step.\n\nDespite the attacks by spirit monsters, the walled town of Rhelton was surrounded by a sprawling shantytown teeming with life.  Arion raised his guard as he approached the sea of tattered canvas tents.  He shifted his eyes between the scores of people, wary for signs of cutpurses or cutthroats.  The smell of the place hardly helped his focus.  Every nook of the slum reeked of unwashed bodies and heavily spiced stew that made his eyes water.\n\nNearly everyone Arion passed stared up at him with sunken, hungry eyes.  Children stopped playing and either pointed at him or ran when he walked by.  Older folk were bolder.  They hissed at him and stood guard in front of the younger ones.  They brandished kitchen knives, pitchforks, or even holy Sun charms meant to ward off evil.\n\nThe sight of all those angry faces only worsened Arion\u2019s tics.  Every few seconds, he\u2019d feel a burning urge to jerk his head to the side, slap himself, or snarl like some rabid animal.\n\nEach time a tic slipped past his guard, he drew more bad attention to himself.  Then the new narrowed eyes on him only inflamed his need to twitch or snarl again.  Arion plastered a smile on his face and muttered, \u201cit\u2019s alright, folks.  I\u2019m a spirit hunter.  I\u2019m here to help.\u201d",

There's something more that's needed in order for this to feel like a complete story, instead of just a snippet from a longer work. I also think you could reduce the cast of characters as the focus seems to mainly be on the 2 brothers and their friend Edgar.",

Your setup for the rest of the adventure is solid, and I'm interested in seeing where it all goes. Your prose needs some work in my opinion, but that's to be expected from a draft. The action was really enjoyable though and I think you should lean into it going forward. If you're interested in a more detailed critique let me know, but the bottom line is that with some work you're going in the right direction.\n\nI'm excited to see more, keep writing!",

            "Hi! I just gave this a read. I really enjoyed it!! You\u2019re great at descriptions & I like the way you\u2019ve written Arion. He\u2019s definitely likable and I sympathized with him immediately. I actually saw your comment a few days ago about writing an OC with Tourettes and upvoted it! I love how he \u2018forgets\u2019 about the curse when he\u2019s fighting & in his element. I think it\u2019s cool how you\u2019re weaving that sort of realism into fantasy.

            "I think you could improve your hook and the first (nine I counted) paragraphs. Most people know what a dorm room looks like. Even If I were standing in the room I would be extremely bored listening to the protagonist explain where she wants to place every piece of furniture. I'd tell her, \"Hey let's get out of here and explore the campus! You can think about how hard it will be to unpack your books from this bookshelf *after you\u2019ve graduated* some other time. Yeah yeah yeah, that's a very nice chair you have, let go!\"\n\n  \nEdit: I read a little further. The two interactions she has with Wren and Kayley seem like a missed opportunity for something interesting to happen. Something that makes her think, that's weird? But she brushes it off. The blurb said she meets a myriad of strange students and the two people we meet seem perfectly normal. I can\u2019t tell them apart. Which leads to the protagonist's first sight of Dorian and Alaric. \n\nI know that there is supposed to be a mystical element to them but the vibe I'm getting is that she is a bit creepy. She\u2019s feeling this strange aura from them, but it's the first time the reader is confronted with a magical element, we don\u2019t get any hints from the tour, her RA, or her new best friend.  Some hints, clues, and foreshadowing can make that moment when she first sees Dorian and Alaric more meaningful. The reader can put together these clues and attribute them to the strange feelings she\u2019s experiencing.",

The reader needs to know who the protagonist is, unless the campus and her room have a personality (the campus could have some strange and creepy lore that adds to the plot) it\u2019s not as important as your protagonist. To get into the headspace of the book you need to know who your protagonist is, their likes, dislikes, greatest fears, dreams, and wishes. What does she want to get out of her college experience?

            "I relate. Just write. Get those characters moving. Sometimes it will surprise you to see that is indeed enough for a short novel, and other times it will take you to new paths, subplots that will show up as you go. Naturally, it depends on what story you are writting. Solutions will not take the same form in a spy thriller than in a historical novel set up in ancient Rome. Think also on what commentary the novel can carry. A detective novel is not just about the case, for example, but the whole world around it, a social commentary on the circumstances, the street, a political sideplot. A historical novel is not just about characters in the middle ages moving thorugh the specific plot, but about representing more accuratelly that period. Show that world. As usual, the root advice here is to read. Check books on the genere you are tackling, grab a couple of novels (good or decent ones, to be on the safe side) and read them trough and trough and isolate the main plot with those things that are not, the side plotd or mere background, and you will get a clearer vision on how to bring your novel into a more complete form.",

            "I'm a discovery writer/pantser: I come up with a vague personality or two, a scenario that sounds interesting to plug them into, and then I let it all bounce around like pinballs, flipping my writer paddles here and there as needed to keep things going until I have an entire cast and a book-shaped thing at the end.\n\n\nBecause of this, I find tropes to come in very handy; like Legos you can bolt onto your story to smooth out pacing and add intriguing wrinkles.\n\n\nSay you want to write James Bond, and you've got Bond, Doctor von Naughty, an idea for a cool chase scene through Venice, and the macguffin. But you still need all the rest, right?\n\n\nOkay, so Bond needs to receive the mission in the first place, which means you set up MI6 and quickly teach us their function in this world. Now, Bond needs to show he's got the skills we're going to see more of later: he flirts with Moneypenny, he quips with Q, he shows loyalty and professionalism to M. We now have a baseline of who he is.\n\n\nYou can also block this out more by starting earlier - maybe we see him waking up in a supermodel's bed to show he's a cad, or you sprinkle in some flashbacks of his Wound or training days. Maybe there's a plucky reporter waiting outside his apartment block, and we learn what he does is secret or some future seeds are planted about the villain.\n\n\nSpeaking of the villain: show us their arena of power (Volcano lair! Minions! Shadowy Board of Investors!) hint at their Wound/origin story, the first moves that get this whole story rolling.\n\n\nBack to Bond: two cool things about super spies is all the flashy gadgets and sleek style (suits, cars, etc). This is tricky to write at the start, but you can also come back and layer in the tools we'll see used later.\n\n\nSo, setup done, now we can move into our main story. BUT! Maybe Act 1 is only about 15-20% of your genre's expected length, and you need to bring that up another 5-10%> Here is a good spot to remind you that stories are fractal. Just like we can add in those Lego blocks like the supermodel scene, or additional Q gadgets (I'll come back to this later), or flashbacks to Bond's past, we can also add fail points too, which will add some realism to your story.\n\n\nSo, maybe\u00a0one of Q's gadgets blows up in the demonstration and he's got to scramble for an unexpected replacement (which of course ends up coming in clutch later, because tropes). Or maybe Bond *refuses* the mission - well, first we are going to need 1) a damn good reason why, 2) a fallout scene of how this effects his life/those around him, and 3) consequences. For example: 1) he's older now and seen too much, he said he was retiring and he meant it. 2) M is disappointed, MI6 is full of whispers and frosty looks, a flashy new wiz kid agent is brought in to take Bond's place. 3) It's Bond, so explosions and Meaningful Death. Maybe wiz kid was Bond's spunky young protege, maybe it's Moneypenny or Q or M, or the supermodel from the open. Whatever it is, it galvanizes Bond into action, and he takes the mission after all.\n\n\nYou can do this 2 steps forward and one step back all through the main narrative, adding both excitement and length to what would otherwise be a fairly straightforward story. Hell, at the end Bond could slip up and let Doctor von Naughty get away, and then you've got a whole sequel.\n\n\nAlright, so all that? That is the power of tropes. They make it pretty easy to pitch your idea to an agent or write a selfpub blurb too, because they are narrative touchstones embedded in the cultural consciousness. And once you start actually writing it, it will feel far less tropey, and more like *your* story, but it's a decent way to get started.\n\n\nGo on a tvtropes.com deep dive. Study story structures and beat sheets - hero's journey, heroine's journey (Gail C's book is amazing), save the cat, romancing the beat, etc etc etc. Even (especially!) if they are outside your chosen genre, because then you can see how different structures emphasize this or that element to affect a story's flow.\u00a0And I cannot recommend this video lecture from\u00a0Mary Robinette Kowal highly enough, because while she is focusing on short stories it's absolutely applicable to writing at any length:\nhttps://youtu.be/blehVIDyuXk?si=eS2EDiZbHOFWGgLr",

I\u2019ve always been obsessed with film noir and want to mix the two so badly.   \n\nI should also add that this is for a short film, not a book.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out what would cause them to bounce between realities and what not but then the conversation with my teacher happened and decided the character would either be undiagnosed or completely off their meds."

You don't have to share your stories, if you don't want to.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's also the writer's curse. Something you really like today can look like shite two weeks later. That's good, because it means you've grown as a writer. You start noticing more and more flaws, which you can then edit, until you like it again.\n\n\nEvery writer in history has produced bad, clunky sentences and sometimes whole books that just didn't work out at all. It's the same in other fields, too. Look at the Beatles. They have some amazing songs and some that make me go \"what the hell were they thinking?\".\n\n\nIt's necessary. You will never write only good things. Not every sentence will be good, not every story will be good, but some of it definitely will. That \"some\" will grow. Instead of 1 out of 10 sentences being good, now it will be 3. Soon it will be 4 or 6 and before you know it, bad sentences will be the exception.\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, no one is watching you. Just write. Accept that you WILL write some bad stuff, maybe a lot of it in the beginning, but you will also get better at it. What others might say about your work doesn't matter. You're not a pro yet, you're still learning.\n\n\nJudging by your post, you are definitely able to express yourself clearly. That's a big step towards being a decent writer, in my opinion.",

Anything before publishing is a learning experience, a chance to improve my craft and story.\n\n\nThen I make sure (because I self pub) that my cover and blurb and everything is on point for my audience, so I don't accidentally have yacht snobs wandering into my bicycle shop. (Okay, sure - you didn't like that chapter. But ma'am this is a Wendy's and it's a fav trope/genre staple of something you don't like but chose to read anyway.) If I've failed here, that's on me but it can still be fixed.\n\n\n\nSometimes you gotta remember that folks have bad days or are just terrible people, and they'll take that out on a lil $5 eBook like I ran over their grandma's house in a monster truck.

I have seen folks complain about the stupidest stuff and have learned its often really more reflective of who they are as a person than the thing they are complaining about.

There's no magic formula, it's exposing yourself and suffering until your skin is tough enough.\n\nThere will be someone talking shit about you and what you do regardless of what you do. Post your story, someone will eventually say something stupid, don't post and your own mind will call you a coward and lame, confirming your fear and making it even harder to overcome next time. Which do you prefer?\n\nI prefer to post and let others curse and despise, what do they know? The opinion of haters hurts you as much as you let it.

Truthfully? I'm looking forward to it. Because it's a stepping stone to improving. It's easy for me to look at my work through rose tinted glasses.

            "the thing about writing as opposed to e.g. dance, live music, cooking, is that you can always go back and make the thing you're creating better. and the thing about writing as opposed to sports is that you aren't going to hit a physical peak and then decline - you can always get better, no matter how old you are or how late you started.\u00a0\n\n\nwhen you look at it that way, writing is a pretty low risk medium, because the work people are critiquing can always be better tomorrow than it is today.\u00a0",

Don't force it, let it come naturally.\n\nAlso... The fear prevents you from writing? So you can't judge your own work with your own eyes because you don't write, are you sure it's not an excuse to postpone or something? I'm saying it in a direct way, sorry... Most people who publish their works are only known in their very specific genre, and someone in the street wouldn't have heard of them at all. Just like many singers are never 'famous', but it doesn't mean their songs are bad, you know? If you see the good things in your story, if you try your best, if things are coherent and you feel emotions and all when you read your own story, there will always be people who will see those good things too and love them!\n\nYou have to believe in yourself and your aptitudes, because the only thing keeping you at bay aren't people's comments, it's only yourself for now.

I don't really have a worry on, (assuming people find it and read it), if they like it or not. art is all subjective, but there's some sort of linear improvement structure that occurs in writing. no matter what, in a few years, you'll look back at your first book, or chapter 1, or whatever release structure you're using, and you'll cringe, going \"agh!! I could have written this so much better with my current skillset..!!!\", but that's fine. that means you've improved.  \n\n\nI've been planning my comic for years now, and I'm finally doing chapter 1 (I've almost finished thumbnailing; that's 'first draft' for you novelists'), and I'm happy with how it's coming out writing and art wise. are you happy with yours? if not, that's OK, you just gotta keep working hard. art is a gradual process of infinite improvement as long as you can take that criticism and turn it into something positive, aiding your creative process.  \n\n\npeople actively looking to hurt others will always exist; you'll never change their minds no matter how good or bad your writing is, so don't worry about them. focus on actual criticisms and how you can improve from them. if you can believe in your ego while still retaining a sense of not being above others, you'll become a great writer, because to be a good writer you have to:  \n\n\n1. do your best and believe in what you're doing and that you'll do great.  \n\n2. stay grounded and don't become conceited; understand that you, aswell as all writers, are imperfect.",

They aren't the things that will help us improve our writing, or the constructive feedback we need. Those come from editors and beta readers. \n\nI used to read reviews. Some made me so happy, others pissed me off. Until it clicked that I was invading a space that really didn't belong to me. So, I ignore them, and go on my merry way.\n\nAs for forums, I've never posted anything but fanfic in public websites, and when you do criticism might happen: it's inevitable. But you have to be able to filter things that are relevant and you agree with, from things that are someone's personal taste. You'll never please everyone. Just write what you love."
