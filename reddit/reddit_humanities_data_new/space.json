            "So I just recently heard this, and thought I would read about it, and I want to inquire why this is theorized or offered by Google, since I am not actually an astrophysicist or other space expert.\n\nFrom the front of Google:  \nIs the moon drifting away from Earth? - \"But it is moving away from us and it's actually changing our understanding of how our own planet interacts with it, affecting things like the length of days in Earth. Scientists say the Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, 3.82 centimeters per year.\"  \nWhat will happen to Earth? - \"We'll have fewer aquatic tides, a lengthening day, no more seasons, and no more stunning total solar eclipses. But watch out for more asteroid impacts. The moon is Earth's only friend. And yet\u2014despite a relationship stretching back billions of years\u2014the gap between us only grows wider.\"  \nCan we survive without the Moon? - \"Life as we know it wouldn't be able to survive. If the moon disappeared, the length of a day on Earth would become much shorter. It would be between six and twelve hours. When the moon orbits, it exerts a pull on Earth, slowing down its rate of spin by about 2 milliseconds every hundred years, slowly lengthening a day.\"\n\nNow-- first off, I feel like 3 contradicts 2, in saying that-- if there was no Moon the day would be much shorter (where two says it would be longer)\n\nThe way I understand it without Google is this:\n\nThe length of day/night is determined by the planet's time of orbit around the host star compared to the planet's axial rotation and distance from the star. This should change little if there was no Moon, as that would not have that much effect on either the Earth's orbit time or distance from the Sun. Thus the day would not significantly be shorter or longer, it may fluctuate a little without the magnetic counterweight of the Moon.\n\nWeather is partially determined by axial inclination. Mercury for example, is a nearly perfectly vertical planet, and so would not experience seasonal change or weather patterns, if it were able to. Venus is a nearly perfectly vertical \"upside down\" planet, and so also would not experience seasonal change or weather patterns, if it were able to. The Earth is not, it is 21-23 degrees inclined, and this affects things like having solstice and the switch of seasons, and weather patterns. The Moon leaving would affect weather patterns, and might drag out or shorten seasons, due to the disappearance of tidal effect on Earth, but it could not stop weather or seasons from occurring completely.\n\nThe Moon's \"Gravity\" or magnetic field is insignificant compared to the Earth, because the Moon has nearly no surface pressure or atmosphere, and the Moon's overall mass, probably the biggest factor of magnetic strength, is 1% of the Earth's. If you look at time lapse recordings taken by Nasa and other space centers, the Moon actually moves very little outside its orbit, its own axial rotation is very slow and hardly noticeable from Earth, and the Moon more wobbles back and forth in place with the Earth's magnetic fluctuation, and is held in its orbit by the Earth's magnetic field. This is perhaps the same principle that is utilized to keep the ISS and other local satellites held in place. Yes, the weakening or degradation of the Earth's magnetic field would loosen its hold on the Moon, causing it to speed up and drift away, but the likely causes of this has little to do with the Moon itself.\n\nAt the rate of 3-4cm/year, it would possibly take 5+ billion years before the Moon is fully independent of Earth, and we would be more likely to see the Sun go nova by that amount of time, or possibly see the collision of Andromeda Galaxy with the Milky Way by then.\n\nFeel free to give explanation if any of my observations is false.",

            "A Dyson Sphere - by definition - encompasses a star. So, no, you're not building this 'on Earth'.\n\nThe mass requirements would be pretty big and would largely depend on how thick you want the shell to be. A lower bound I've seen being thrown around would be 10 Earth masses, but that still assumes some very exotic stabilization methods of the entire structure.\n\nThat said: There's no real point in building one. If you are that far advanced that you *could* build one then you're at a state where you don't *need* to build one.",
            "With some simple math, if we were to build a Dyson Sphere that fully encompasses the Sun and very near to it, and were able to construct 1,000 square kilometers per year of the sphere, it would take us roughly 6-7 billion years.\u00a0 (6.09x10^13 km/1,000).\u00a0 10,000 km^2 would be 600 million years, 100,000 km^2 would be 60 million, etc.\u00a0 If we were able to build enough to cover the surface area of the earth every year, it would take roughly 10,000 years.\u00a0 \u00a0And all of this is assuming a Dyson Sphere very smart to the Sun's surface.\u00a0 Assuming it was at all a distance from the surface, we start going exponential on the time and area.\n\n\nWhich is probably why a Dyson Sphere is utterly impractical and pointless.\u00a0 Its an absurdist concept.",
            "It would take quite a many years, as the Earth does not have the tech to do that efficiently yet. The idea of Dyson Sphere Project was first proposed in the 1960s if I recall. A Dyson Sphere is built around the host star, in this case the Sun, and absorbs the energy of the sun to convert to electric generation that is transferred back to Earth or wherever.\n\nIt would also currently be pretty much impossible and egregiously expensive to make, because the Earth has no alloy that is capable of withstanding such close range to the Sun's heat or plasma flares indefinitely yet. Thats the first issue even if there was the ability to construct or deploy satellites and the Dyson shell close to the Sun.",

            "Good question. I guess we'll have to wait and see. As we see with airplanes they have the capacity to land on populated areas and do great damage, but they are still allowed to fly around over stuff because they have such a good track record of safety. And also to some degree because catastrophic failures of airplanes which result in a loss of control are uncommon.\n\nIf launch vehicles progress to a point of reusability and reliability where uncontrolled flight is the extreme exception then we might end up seeing launch facilities all over the place just as we see airports.",

            "Often they are trying to use designs or even parts from more than 3 decades ago. (It's to preserve their \"testing heritage\".)\n\nA lot of folks who worked on these things have retired. And some of this stuff is extremely late-20th-century state-of-the-art engineering, very difficult stuff. The RS-25 engine is an amazing engineering feat. \n\nAnd then there's the whole conversation about fixed-price vs. cost-plus contracting, which I won't go into detail, here. Orion and the SLS rocket are cost-plus contracts, which in this case have resulted in ballooning budgets, ever-extending schedules, and a lot of criticism in general.",
            "Indeed, the SLS was sold as a way to get to a heavy lift launch vehicle that would be faster and cheaper because it made use of existing Shuttle hardware and designs.\n\nSo on the one hand, good news, the SLS was able to make use of substantial chunks of existing Shuttle technology. The main engines are just off the shelf (with options to make lower cost expendable versions later), the SRBs used the same SRB tech as the Shuttle but added an additional segment. The main fuselage and tankage could be based on the existing Shuttle External Tanks. The first upper stage would just use an off the shelf upper stage from the Delta IV. And so on.\n\nBut on the other hand, bad news. The SLS has been built by some of the least cost and schedule efficient folks in the history of aerospace. So as we've seen the SLS program has gobbled up over 20 billion in funding (enough for 10 Shuttle launches, enough for 200 Falcon Heavy launches) over nearly two decades of development just to arrive at where we are today with one and only one successful launch so far, with the second launch (of all time) not planned until next year at the earliest. This is why \"Old Space\" has a bad name.",
            "The goal is *spending money,* not launching missions to the Moon. Moon missions are just what they're spending the money *on.* With that perspective, the program makes perfect sense and is a tremendous success: keeping legacy program suppliers and engineers gainfully employed and contracted for the length of their remaining careers.\n\nThe Orion capsule (holdover from Ares) took time to develop; it is an underpowered rocket (relative to Saturn V) necessitating a different lunar orbit than Apollo, and the lander is aiming for the pole and not the equator, so they are building a lunar space station too.\n\nIt's a very good question and I hope you get good answers from others who can explain in detail why 'shuttle-derived' was not easier, faster and cheaper than an altogether new design. (Aside from the key point, which is to spend money, not to launch rockets.)",
            "A nuclei would tunnel/teleport to extreme close proximity of another and they would fuse together by cold fusion, crating an heavier element. The strong force would normally repel the two nuclei, keeping them far enough apart, but the tunnelling make them end up close enough for the process to occur. Elements heavier than iron would undergo radioactive decay until they end as iron.",

            "No, it would mostly behave like a liquid.\n\nThe impact would be large enough to go through the earth\u2019s crust like butter. Anything not flung into space would be melted, the entire planet and crust would melt and much most of it would be flung into space, where it would vaporize or coagulate into small mostly grains. There would still probably be a big molten blob where the planet was but much of the mass would be in a vapor cloud around the planet, some on an escape velocity, some not.\n\nThey would reform over time due to gravity, not necessarily into a single object, such as what happened with the big impact that created our moon.",
            "I was thinking about a ridiculous situation in a book, where a villain \u201cblew up the moon.\u201d I was trying to imagine what would realistically happen if there was a big explosion, or if there was a large impact at interstellar speeds.",

            "In the past decades, researchers have used the world's strongest supercomputers to simulate millions, perhaps now billions of events of the Earth being struck by a planetary sized object at various angles and speeds, for the purpose of seeing if this is how the Moon came to be.\n\nYou can now look up many of these sims of a theoretical Earth being struck online, to get an idea of what would occur.\n\nIn the theoretical simulation of the creation of the Moon, in most cases the Earth survives the impact and the colliding object is obliterated on impact. Thus for it to destroy the Earth completely, or shove it out of its orbit, which is more likely, it would have to be a planetary object of larger mass than this one being simulated.",

            "No, the redshift from a stellar mass black hole is not significant enough to measure. But it would cause [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens).\n\nWe have searched really hard to find black holes like this, because they if they are common it would solve the dark matter problem. Unfortunately they are very rare.",
            "Whyt do you mean by 'significant'? That's a very qualitative word. Gravitational redshift/time dilation has an effect as soon as any mass (or better: energy density) is present.

For example, at the big bang, all the matter you see today didn't even exist.  It was in the form of vacuum energy.  It's theorized the vacuum energy spontaneously decayed to a lower state and all the extra energy was converted into matter at that time.  This is what we call the big bang.   So none of the matter had even existed before this event.  It was just energy in empty space, contained in quantum fields.  If you are thinking this sounds weird and impossible then you should learn that all matter is in fact quantum fields that are excited in certain ways.  Also Einstein proved E=mc^2 so it's entirely possible to obtain mass from energy directly and we think this happens constantly in the vacuum even today.  Particles blink into and out of existence continuously in the vacuum even today.  They are called virtual particles.

            "> Can gas and dust and any other debris between an observer and observed object in space really cause red shifting?\n\nNo, or at least not the red shifting we are seeing.",
            "It would simply cause differential absorption, it wouldn't shift the whole spectrum.\n\nThere are different ways to estimate the redshift of a distant galaxy. One technique is to look at the overall light across different narrowband filters and find where the light drops off. This makes it possible to determine where the \"Lyman break\" has been shifted, which is the line where the light from the galaxy drops off dramatically. You can then figure out the observational wavelength range where the Lyman break appears to lie and use that to calculate the redshift of the galaxy. Potentially, one could argue that various effects like \"weird dust\" could absorb light at cosmological distances and cause a false Lyman break effect that made a galaxy look more redshifted than it was.\n\nHowever, the other major technique for determining redshift is by taking very detailed spectra of distant galaxies and looking for atomic emission spectral lines. Those spectral lines are fixed by quantum mechanics to originate at certain wavelengths, and their arrangement is very distinctive, like a set of fingerprints. Today we have a plethora of instruments which make it possible to collect sufficiently detailed spectra of distant galaxies to determine their redshift very precisely with a significant degree of confidence that the only factor at play is a full on spectral shift of original wavelengths to observed wavelengths. This pretty conclusively rules out the potential for \"red dust\" to simply be absorbing shorter wavelength light. One example being the galaxy [GN-z11](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/09/aa46159-23/aa46159-23.html) which has had detailed spectra taken allowing us to determine its redshift at z = 10.6034 +/- 0.0013, which as you can see is a very high level of precision.",

The presence of LOX can definitely make for a more prompt deflagration explosion (generally it won't be a proper detonation though) but these are more quantitative vs. qualitative differences. A jet liner crashing into a populated area can still kill thousands and cause billions in damages. The reason jet liners are allowed to fly over populated areas is because there's a huge system of training and certification of pilots and aircraft and a long track record of safety, not because it's impossible for them to crash and kill thousands while doing billions in damage. If rockets could match that track record they would likely be allowed to fly over/near populated areas too.\n\nRealistically the biggest constraint on where orbital rockets will be allowed to fly will come from acoustics, launches are extremely loud, and rockets traverse the sound barrier on liftoff and more important on landing, so figuring out reasonable corridors where that can occur would be important.",

So I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see them stay on station as long as possible in case they think of something to try a week from now.\n\nThat said, also won't be surprised at this point if they do start pursuing more extreme options (i.e. using Soyuz or Dragon to come back) for some reason they haven't made public yet.",
            "What's not right is you not understanding what they're actually doing.\n\nIt CAN be explained under collecting more data - the service module with the faulty thrusters and leaking helium doesn't come back so engineers can't visually inspect them. With Starliner docked, they can run various tests to better understand the issues.\n\nPeople also need to understand that things in spaceflight, unless it's an emergency situation, are done very methodically and very deliberately. Something as simple as closing a valve on Starliner to run a test probably has to run through so many checks that it takes multiple days to get approved.  And that doesn't include the time to build the rest plan.",
            "That\u2019s entirely bullshit given that they had already delayed the return from the 22 to the 26. If that was really the case they would have delayed directly to July instead of the double delay that happened \u201cstrangely\u201d just after a senior executives meeting.",

            "It's unlikely that the helium running out is the direct problem that's causing the delay and the possible grounding.\n\nIt's more likely that, because of the myriad of leaks and the failure of some of the RCS/OMS thrusters, they're concerned about what may happen when the vehicle is undocked.  If a valve or line fails hard enough to vent the entire tank rapidly, that would be a problem.  If there's unaccounted for hypergolic propellants, that could be a problem.",
            "Can't we just send up a bunch of balloons to them?",
            "I would say any kind of on-orbit helium replenishment is effectively impossible. Even if you could get to the service panel on a spacewalk and get it off and connect a hose and somehow strain relieve that hose and leak check the connection, you'd eventually need to close it back out.\n\nNot to mention there is a lot more equipment needed to fill a helium tank to the pressures they likely need. It's not a simple blowdown operation. You likely need a pump, pumps in space are pretty miserable. The pump needs its own supply of compressed air/nitrogen to operate, so now you need a compressor. And air to compress. Which is in short supply in space.",

            "I'm sure Space X can keep it supplied indefinitely.",
            "This is something they account for. Rockets can explode, the ISS always has enough supplies to account for the absolute maximum number of people to survive well beyond the next scheduled resupply. I don't know the exact number, but my guess would be that they have 2.5 to 3 times as much food, water, scrubbers, etc. on hand at all times as they use between resupplies. Enough that if one resupply goes boom, they wouldn't need to rush the next one before they get desperate, especially because if the previous one failed, rushing the next one is probably a bad idea and extra care should be taken to make sure the same issue doesn't repeat. \n\nSo for two people to be delayed leaving by, like, a couple weeks will hardly stress their supplies.",

I love long, hot showers, and that's simply not a thing astronauts get to enjoy. Fortunately, a big part of what the ISS is currently studying includes inventing new things to make space more palatable for more people. Astronaut food went from goo in tubes to stuff a person would actually choose to eat, the infamous vagina-esque cup has made it possible to sip a hot beverage as you would on the ground. The toilet is still weird, but much better than the diapers they used to use. At least floating pee should be a minimal risk due to the vacuum piss tube",

            "Yeah, I think this really offers up some questions about what role NASA is playing in commercial crew. If NASA were really offering effective oversight, then one would expect that (at least from a technical standpoint) SpaceX and Boeing would perform very similarly because NASA would be enforcing a set of common standards.\n\nSo, since SpaceX was successful, one would expect Boeing to have been successful, even if it took them longer.\n\nThat that didn't happen points to some possibilities:\n * NASA's human spaceflight division doesn't actually know how to set standards and oversee projects in a way that results in a good product and is therefore not qualified to oversee these projects. In which case, what purpose are they serving?\n * NASA really failed to retain the talent they needed. SpaceX's success happened under Kathy Leuders and Bill Gerstenmeir. Both of whom left NASA (Leuders was arguably pushed out) and now work at SpaceX. It doesn't seem totally likely, but it could be that they were providing the management needed to keep NASA providing effective oversight.\n\nNeither scenario would look good for NASA. But unfortunately, I'm not sure what the solution we could expect out of an investigation that would actually help.\n\nUltimately, NASA needs the funding and support to return to being the technical experts in spaceflight. But that will also require a massive cultural shift that you can't really mandate into existence. But instead, an investigation would likely just saddle everyone with more red tape that doesn't actually add much value.",

NASA do not need 2 different capsules doing the same shit when 1 of them is so obviously superior, this whole debacle is a bigger waste of money than even the military pulls off, and this launch itself was a needless risk of human life for the sake of legacy space companies egos and/or stock price.\n\nNASA know better than to launch shit with people on it when it might have problems, they have the pieces of 2 blown up shuttles to remind them of this, why the hell anybody there was ok with launching a leaking capsule in the first place boggles the mind.\n\nIt's becoming more obvious by the day that boeing has way too many friends in high places and needs to be broken up.",

The electromagnetic forces resulting from the dynamo, similar to a motor, drive the inner core to spin slightly faster than the outer core (and the overlying mantle). However, the gravity of the mantle tugging on the inner core can slow it back down, driving it to instead rotate slightly slower than the outer core. This speeding up and slowing down appears to occur over a multi-decadal cycle, of which we happen to be in the slowing down leg.\n\nThe only practical effect is minute changes to the length of day on the order of milliseconds, which can add minor complications to ultra-precise timekeeping.",

The core is also appears to be on a 30 to 70 year cycle (I don't think science is sure yet) of slowing down and speeding up relative to the mantle. Some current studies have showed that the core has started spinning slower relative to than the mantle as far back as 2009. Some studies also sho that we are approaching geomagnet reversal which has happened 100s of times over the course of the planets history. These reversal take thousands of years to complete. The Earth's magnetic field is generated mostly by the convection currents in the out core and not specifically the relative rotation speed. \n\nSo what does this mean for you and the Earth?

Most likely due to the fact that most of humanity civilizations started with agriculture AKA Farming. Where we based on the seasons changing to know when we should plant our crops and harvest them. This gave ancient people a semi accurate measure of time and we used the year as a marker of time. Then probably as civilization progressed, we realised that we needed an accurate account of time for history and whatnot during which, astronomers realises that a year is 365 days due to seasonal changes coinciding with the earth's position around the sun where different constellation are only visible at different times of the year. So they used all this information to make an accurate definition of what a year is which is 365days.",

It could simply be that the question\nis poorly asked and that a better question is \u201cwhat kind of atmospheres require a magnetic field to be sustainable in a given set of solar/stellar activity conditions.\u201d In any case, recent studies such as Brain et al.

            "This is why I genuinely believe we should've kept development on nuclear weapons. It took less than 20 years from the first bomb dropped on Japan that leveled a city, to the Soviet Unions Tsar Bomba, that exploded with a force 3600x more powerful than little boy. It was 10x more powerful than every last munition combined used in WW2, in less than just 20 years. If we had kept development I'm insanely confident we'd have a bomb so unimaginably powerful, it would actually become useful. Such as...... Destroying impossibly large objects threatening earth. I'm talking 1000 + MEGA ton nuclear warheads capable of literally evaporating impossibly large celestial bodies. There is NO known upper limit for possible power of a fusion bomb. We could've been well on our way to a bomb capable of cracking a planet in two. It's scary, but at that size it could prove to be immensely useful the one or two times we'd need such destructive power, mostly for something off earth (obviously). Just 50 megatons produced an explosion the shockwave of which circled the earth three times over. The light produced could be seen from over 600 miles away. Is this a dumb idea? Yea probably. But if we ever have a massive celestial body on collision course with earth, I bet we'd all wish we had such a capability as a species.",
            "Earthly politics? Why NASA wouldn't shoot a big missile on these fast-movings rocky orbs unilaterally? I'm certain nobody would be upset",

            "I mean, we completely botched our response to a resolvable pandemic and turned it into a neverending pandemic that everyone has to pretend is over... so why would we be able to tackle something much more complicated?",

That's the American way, and thank fuck it is because we're most capable of doing something about it. I don't know if that's as much of a logistical or internally political nightmare as you'd think.",
            "Even if they had built the defense system, they'd stop funding maintenance and upkeep on it because it isn't being used. By the time an asteroid actually came along, the system would be there, but inoperable because of neglect.",

I find it hard to envision scientists backing down from a loose-bolt World-leader that wants to do it differently considering how many other scientists agree and the fact that the whole world is at risk.\n\nFor a smaller impact I could see it happening, but for an extinction-level event, the scientists are saving their own lives and families, where it's much harder to say \"fine, I'll do it your way, I don't care\".",

I think with daily Starship launches we could mitigate an asteroid with a month's notice. Obviously given a certain size and lack of warning it's impossible but to the extent that the problem is solvable I think it's actually pretty trivial.\n\nLike a 14-year-out asteroid I think SpaceX could probably solve on their own.

Blowing it up a few hours before it hits isn\u2019t going to do any good, the same amount of energy is still coming at you just in smaller, slightly more radioactive pieces. You need to just hit it with mass to alter the orbit, and the earlier you do that the less energy you need. The critical factor is and always will be time.",

            "Unlikely we would use nukes for that purpose. We'd use a spacecraft that would alter its course by direct kinetic impact.

            "Would the US do that, if the most likely projections were for the impact to be somewhere that would kill lots of people in the Southern Hemisphere but leave US territory and assets alone? What if doing so would cost billions in taxpayer dollars? \n\nAlso, outside Hollywood, nukes aren't likely to be that useful in moving an asteroid. Unless you go full Project Orion.\n\nEDIT: Also also, we're talking about a scenario that's never happened before - we've tried this once on a much much smaller scale with DART, we've never tried to redirect an asteroid with mass enough to be a threat to people on Earth. It's not clear that the USA could handle that without any international cooperation. For one thing, most of the observatories they'd need access to are not in the USA.",
            "Sadly I don't think this is reasonably possible because of the physics. Asteroids move at INCREDIBLY high velocities and the amount of accuracy needed to shoot a relatively slow moving nuke the right way to intercept it is incredibly high. If the Asteroid is large enough, the nuke(s) also likely wouldn't do much other than change its momentum into a different direction, where it could course correct and come at Earth at a different angle in the future.\n\nEdit: It seems I was wrong, I forgot we've actually landed probes before. To be fair, this was from light research and prior knowledge, I'm not an astro-physicist.",

With the relative mass difference of the asteroid and the falcon 9 you would need to speed the falcon 9 up to something like 10% the speed of light before it has enough energy to push a asteroid out of its path in a week.\n\nCoincidentally, a falcon second stage impacting the asteroid at 10% the speed of light releases about the same amount of energy as ten thousand 1 Megaton yield nukes. So even if we unleashed the nuclear arsenal of the entire world it would still not work out for us. We would maybe have had enough nukes at the height of the cold war, not that there is any chance of us deploying them like that.

There would be no reason to return in a Dragon.",
            "Tbh i wouldn\u2019t want to be in the boeing on the way down",
            "No need. Probably never flies again after this",
            "Thanks... Helium leaks ?",
            "Sir\n\nThe snickeree in this situation is Boeing not the iss, who happen to be more than 10k from where i am. \n\nHowever, you are free to snicker at the sky from your backyard every few hours. I am sure the neighbours will find it extremely amusing.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude1c",
            "Understood. These delays are definitely not inspiring confidence.\n\nAren't there a record number of capsules docked rn. Dragon/ starliner/ Cygnus and soyuz + progress",

            "You really have no idea what you are talking about. NASA has no special allegiance to either SpaceX or Boeing.",

            "I bet they are upset about the integrity of the company their live\u2019s are dependent on.\n\nTo say they are happy is entirely speculative and a bit of a cope. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how they currently feel, but we do know they were initially concerned even before launch.",
            "Does Boeing have to pay room and board at rack rate to extend their stay ?",
            "Why would you assume that? Because it is your desire? Both Suni and Butch have expressed they wish to return home.\n\nEdit: Not shocked at the previous users name",

            "Months? Years\\*",
            "On launch, the only issue that couldnt be solved was the helium leak, and that was low enough that it woukdnt have posed a threat to the mission, and fixing it would have meant removing the spacecraft from the rocket entirely and completely stripping it in the factory. So the extra delay and risks of damaging other components during the process of fixing a relatively inconsequential problem was likely viewed as not worth it.",

            "There are a lot of things you can do in emergency situations but never would if you didn\u2019t have to. Honestly, if you can\u2019t 100% guarantee a safe return of the astronauts you have to start considering the alternative",
            "Emergency is emergency, what's the alternative? \n\nBut they wouldn't be changing mission timeline like this if they didn't absolutely have to. \"Reviewing data\" is just another way to say they are doing failure analysis and don't yet fully know what is wrong with it. But if nothing was wrong there would be no unscheduled data review, they would simply complete the mission as scheduled.",

The thruster issue is a concern since theyve had issues with it before on a previous flight, and this time 5 of them failed (though all but 1 of those seem to have recovered afterwards). The helium leak is minor (they have 10 times the helium needed to return safely, and the leaks have lessened in tests over the docking period) but yeah its still something theyre trying to investigate more.",
            "> NASA does not want to lose a crew.\n\nTell that to the Challenger crew. \n\nNASA has ignored advice from engineers before for the sake of optics. It's not gotten better. The last 30 years NASA has been run by clueless politicians who treat the post as a stepping stone for their political career. \n\nA heroic tragedy is far preferable to an embarrassment.",
            "Why would you think that engineers have any say on the matter? \n\nBoth NASA and Boeing have a long history of ignoring engineers at the risk of human lives. All that matters is maintaining that government contract. Having SpaceX rescue them would be more harmful to that contract than the loss of the crew.",
            "I'd go even knowing I would never make it home, so long as the mission had purpose.",
            "Source?\n\nAlso because they're fucking astronauts. This is exactly what they wanted. Unfortunately they're aging and this might be the last trip to the ISS for either or both of them. They are in no rush to leave.",
            "I've yet to see a source that says they think it's in any way, shape, or form less than 100% safe. What I've read is what I stated - part of the ship is designed to burn up on reentry and that's the part of the ship with the failed thrusters. Need to study the thrusters. Can't if they burn up.\n\nSource for claim it's deemed as unsafe?\n\nEdit- also, it'll never be 100% safe, to be clear. I understand the point you were making though. Very little about going from Mach 25 to 0 is \"safe.\"",
            "Thanks. \n\nWhat's with the RCS thrusters? The stuck valves caused so many aborts and yet here we are",
            "RCS issues will be a show stopper as they will completely lose attitude control ( sure there must be redundancy, but still)",

            "I guarantee the only person who would know is the person up in space whether they want to return or not.\n\nIt\u2019s very isolating, and scary to know you may die while being up there since anything could happen between now and the delay.",
            "I agree. And I was one of the super optimizing ones when it came to the helium supplies with the leaks but it\u2019s starting to feel like NASA isn\u2019t even confident these days.",
            "And even at that time it is total bullshit to suggest that they *wanted* to kill the crew. Both Challenger and Columbia were the result of a series of bad decisions made in good faith and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.",
            "I don't understand it. Purpose and altruism seem to outweigh the sacrifice.",
            "If they were in any way really affected by that isolation and risk of death to the point where they are scared neither of them would be up there. Butch is a former US Navy pilot who flew combat missions in Desert Storm and Suni was also a US Navy aviator having logged 3000 hours as a helicopter pilot, supervised various aviation units and been a flight instructor. This is also both *their third trip to space.*\n\nAs humans of course these people are not totally immune to fear, they're not stupid, but given their experience they are just fine in orbit right now. They have stable life support, lots of food and if the spacecraft that took them up there is deemed not capable of safely returning them to earth they'll patiently wait however long it takes for NASA to arrange their trip home.\n\nMeanwhile I can guarantee you both of them are soaking up and trying to enjoy what is most likely their last trip to space as much as they can.",
