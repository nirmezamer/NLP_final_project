            ">\u00a0\u00a0It might be that I'm allergic to crypto bros but this dude is giving me all the wrong vibes.\n\n\nI love some of SE's games, but their executives are boneheads. I mean, the NFT thing was announced *well* after they already crashed and were shown to be a scam. Glad to hear them pulling back on the AI craze, but them blindly jumping on that bandwagon without any research or familiarity with it still points to them being clueless.\n\n\nGranted, I think most executives at most companies are idiots mostly risen through nepotism and luck, but I might just be jaded.",
            "Tbf they used AI for the lip movements for different languages in FF7 rebirth and the result was amazing. That\u2019s one good way to utilise AI to save tons of development time",
            "They used AI for the new KH upscaling, and it messed up a lot of textures. And this isn\u2019t their first time\u2026 they tried to use it on chrono cross, and it absolutely ruined some backgrounds",
            "Square Enix's top brass just suck. They're SO unbelievably bad its a wonder how the company is still functioning. They just don't get it. Square Enix's games are successful in spite of its executives not because of it. Have you ever wondered why there's always reports that \\[insert Square Enix game\\] under delivered and was a disappointment to them? Its because their sales target numbers are STUPID. Like unrealistic and stupid. Like they think their games will do as good as Call of Duty and hit THAT level of mainstream, thats how many units they think they're gonna sell. Its impossible for the developers to hit those targets with the types of games they're making.\n\nBut yeah, the ultimate \"Square Enix execs are dumb\" story is definitely just selling off the ENTIRE Tomb Raider franchise to someone else and using that money to get into NFTs, after the NFT fad died down and people realized its worthlessness.",
            "Use of AI in shit like upscaling, mouth animations in sequels, etc that ASSISTS the process and doesn\u2019t full on replace people is a fantastic thing. But\u2026 idk\u2026 I don\u2019t trust square too much\u2026",
            "So... everyone gets this is a song and dance for the investors, right?  Supporting AI, being careful with AI... it's just to appease the stockholders who probably don't even know what the damn acronym stands for.  \n\nOr we could just keep dooming, that's fun too.",
            "Just a reminder that big gaming companies only care about money and they're never on the gamer's side. The whole NFT/blockhain and AI debacle tells how out of touch SE is.",
            "AI is one of those new topics that EVERYONE is looking at implementing different things for. Initially everyone is gun-ho about it. There are Definitely uses for it across the board. However, if not careful, it can screw with a LOT of stuff in the wrong ways. It's not a \"magic hammer\" that can fix a lot of problems. Can it do a lot if implemented correctly? Sure. but again the correct part has to be looked at with research.",
            "SE's top dogs have been saying this stuff about every tech bro fad for years.",
            "Well yeah, most of the big people there consider themselves ARTIST ASS ARTISTS so I'm sure as soon as execs tried making them use ai for the art or writing, theyd probably freak. Plus just seeing the last six months of the majority of their fans begging them not to us ai and already dumping on them for it.",
            "For a little while it felt like the CEO was trying to hop on every tech trend. I think what Square Enix needs to focus on now is building and maintaining a core fanbase. They tried expanding into a more casual space and it failed.   \n\nI'm not an expert, but from my perspective I think that the best thing Square Enix can do to keep their business profitable is to scale back their flagship franchises to \"AA\" budget games and focus on the audience that has been playing and enjoying their games for years.   \n\nGetting back to the roots of what made them successful to begin with and listening to feedback from their most loyal fans is, I feel, the best approach to make sure their next few releases are successful.",
            "Yeah I just want to get the end of remake trilogy already before the idiots do something catastrophic.",
            "Had the past been slightly different people would have said they were fools to make a console MMO too.  You can't expect every bold move to come out ahead but it's proven far more beneficial for them to lead the way with new technology rather than chase what's popular.",
            "To be fair, square has a long history of jumping on trends or trying to do the next big thing, and it ultimately undermines their company about 80% of the time\u00a0",
            "Than I am jaded with you because I believe the culture of failing upwards is starting to catch up with us",
            "You're not jaded. And of course there are always exceptions to a rule, but you're definitely not far off.",
            "The only reason I even remotely give a shit about SE is because of Yoshi P and FFXIV. If not for that I probably would have dropped this company like I did Blizzard.",
            "To be fair, AI upscaling for ports is nothing new; that\u2019s fairly old emulator technology.",
            "I mean you\u2019re not wrong but all the shit ppl are talking about in this thread was set in motion well before Kiryu entered the picture, even the AI stuff. Dude joined the company and basically spent the next year working on production and org realignment while evaluating performance in projections that were determined before he joined the company. He hasn\u2019t been around long enough for us to see the results of like 90% of anything he\u2019s done.\n\nI\u2019m still wary of him but Matsuda got all y\u2019all messed up. Personally I think the fact that Kiryu signed off on so many dev team leads being promoted to the board is a very good thing; there are fewer suits involved in the decision making at Square than any point since like the early 2000s.",
            "They're honestly legendary dumb. Some of the swings they've taken over the years are just beyond ludicrous.\n\nSometimes there was even some artistical hubris fueling it, like with the Spirits Within movie. I can forgive those, they were trying to push the artistic and technical envelope at the very least.\n\nBut more often than not it's just pure, calculated greed.\n\nAnd they suck at maths.",
            "I think the ultimate Square Enix execs are dumb story is The Spirits Within. I think it's still to this day in the top 3 biggest bombs in movie history. It forced Sakaguchi out of the CEO role.",
            "As a die hard Tomb Raider fan it killed me when they sold to Embracer. It was sold for so little and embracer is such a scam of a company. Now it's in amazons grubby mits... I truly don't understand why they're so incapable of making good business decisions but I guess that's something plaguing the whole industry right now",
            ">Its because their sales target numbers are STUPID. Like unrealistic and stupid.\n\nTheir target numbers are calculated way before the game even enters development. Like, when calculating the budget and development time. If you get 100 million to develop a game then you need a certain number of sales to get it back and then extra to actually make money. So you have a number where you break even, a number where you'd say \"this is fine I guess\", a number where you'd call it a success and a number where you'd call it a huge success if it surpasses it.\n\nWhenever SE calls something a disappointment, it's because even the lower end numbers, which were needed to break even,  weren't reached. They aren't pulling these numbers out of their asses to get mad about.\n\n[Here's](https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/05/24/square-enix-final-fantasy-unrealistic-sales-targets-jacob-navok) an interesting article that talks about SE sales expectations and why they're actually pretty reasonable, given the circumstances.\n\nTo quote:\n>With 3 million copies of FFXVI sold (the latest figure disclosed by Square Enix), the company would have only made around $120 million according to these rough estimates. In reality, budgets of AAA games like this are likely higher than $100 million, so it is not that Square Enix\u2019s expectations are unrealistic. These titles just don\u2019t sell well enough for the amount of money that go into their production and marketing.\n\nSquares problem isn't \"high expectations\", it's high development costs + business deals that were made in the beginning/middle of the 2010s but that didn't take fruition until 2020, which was when the gaming landscape had already shifted a lot.",
            "Yeah I could have sworn we\u2019ve been hearing about SE investing in this for like 3 years now, and the only thing that resulted in was a NFT game that only made like 8 million in profit last fiscal year as far as I\u2019m aware.",
            "Thats where the meme SE killed this or that tech bro fad comes from. They get into it, supposedly at least, and they come into it years and years way too late when no one cares about it anymore and then the quietly bury that and find a new old one to talk about.",
            "They were not the first ones to make a console MMO, that would be Phantasy Star Online, and it did quite well in all it's iterations. Square Enix were very much hoping to make an equivalent game using their much more popular IP on a much more popular console.\n\nSo box they were not \"setting a trend\" by making a console MMO, they were improving on an already tested formula, much like Blizzard with WoW vs EverQuest.\n\nThis is not to disparage FFXI in any way though, FFXI was a fantastic MMO. But it wasn't a bolder a move as you might think since they already had a blueprint to follow.",
            "It shouldnt be this hard to do. Its like.. just do what you're good at! Square have this weird obsession with being super mainstream, like Call of Duty tier mainstream. They're always desperately chasing that mainstream audience instead of finding a niche and just being the best in that niche and having a dedicated fanbase. Sometimes their sales target numbers, for a company like Square is absolutely ridiculous.",
            "Tbf, if u make 10 mobile games, 9 die off and 1 is kinda populair, u\u2019re still making bank",
            "After Reforged, I refused to give Blizzard any money. That burned me so bad for one of my favorite games ever. And frankly, *every* game they've done for over a decade has been a mess or bad for players since the Activision merger.\n\n\nSquare has plenty of games that I enjoy, but I'm a lot more suspicious of their big projects. Triangle Strategy was a blast, I like Dragon Quest, and most of the remasters are solid. But a new mainline FF or Kingdom Hearts I can't just blindly buy. I wait for reviews for their games and pass on some stuff, which I didn't use to.",
            "It's just filters with extra steps.",
            ">\u00a0The Spirits Within. I think it's still to this day in the top 3 biggest bombs in movie history\n\n\nIt was a huge failure, absolutely, among top at the time. But nowadays it's way lower on the list. The Marvels, John Carter, and Lone Ranger were all absolutely monstrous disasters, even adjusting for inflation.\n\n\nNow Disney can handle bombs like that, they swing big and sometimes it's Endgame, sometimes it's The Marvels. While, like you point out, it devastated Square, completely changing the dynamic for the Enix merger and ruining careers.",
            "\nThat 120 million is the net profit, not the gross. That's what they made after covering costs and the wording there is very deceptive.\n\nThese targets, as mentioned in the article, are based off stock market ROI projections. A public company is obligated to grow as part of the stalkholder model, not just make profits. These targets are determined by what the company needs to do to make more than the previous year.\n\nYes, they expected to make more, and the boom of 2020 did give a false of industry growth. But the thing left unsaid is that these games are still very successful. The article also mentioned that FF16 will likely make it's targets eventually. \n\nYou might notice that Square Enix has prioritised industry trends that were predicted to have a short half life (live services, nft's etc). Their huge drop is stock market value is not due to these single player games.\n\nEvery failed game they published, like actually failed to make a profit like The Avengers, were part of this new direction. It's indicative of the growth model these companies are bound to. It's why every major publisher chase these trends despite single player games making plenty of money. It's also why  these huge companies are engaging in mass layoffs instead of cutting profits at the top so the bottom line remains in the black. \n\nSo please, don't defend them. There are nuances to this, but it all comes back to greed ultimately.",
            "Pattern recognition is seemingly a very difficult thing for most people.  Much easier to just work themselves up into a fury.",
            "PSO isn't really an MMO it's just an online ARPG, closer to Diablo than FFXI",
            "Yeah, they could be a super prestigious name if they just stuck to story-based RPGs and maybe a few spinoffs, but they've ruined their reputation by constantly chasing trends and fads and releasing shit games just to copy whatever made some other company money.",
            "They tasted that sweet mainstream audience in the late 90s and they never realized that opportunity is gone!\u00a0",
            "What sucks is that The Spirits Within could have been a decent sci-fi movie a lot of people would have enjoyed, and even gotten a bit more grace if it was subtitled and chalked up to \"lost in translation\"/niche Japan-centric stuff westerners wouldn't notice.\n\nAll they'd had to do was call it anything except for \"Final Fantasy.\"",
            "So by your definition Path of Exile, or Diablo 3 & 4, for that matter, are not MMOs?",
            "Problem is they spent *way* too much money on it to have it be a foreign language, subtitled film. Mainstream audiences have almost never shown up for that. There's a handful of successful examples that did well, but only because they had a tiny budget. Godzilla minus one, Pan's Labyrinth, etc were successes, but still made fat less than Spirits Within's\u00a0 budget.\n\n\nI think Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is the only time a foreign language film hit actual block buster numbers. And that film is a masterpiece and was a lucky fluke for hitting that success. Everything else (like Demon Slayer or Spirited Away) was primarily shown dubbed, and/or were cheaper projects.\n\n\nI see no way for that film to have ever been a success unless they slashed the budget for it in half. 137mil, and in 2001, was a *huge*. For reference, it was more expensive than any of the top 5 films that year, Harry Potter, LotR, Monsters Inc, Shrek, Oceans 11. It was always doomed.",
            "I haven't played PoE to compare but D3 and D4 are not MMO status because they have smaller maps with less players on the screen at once.  Diablo 4 is much closer but top-down gameplay makes it a lot less practical to put hundreds of people in one area.",
            "none of those are mmos",
            "You have a rather narrow view of what constitutes an MMO, but ok.",
            "And Guild Wars 1? Not an MMO either?",
            "It mostly needs to meet the massive part, I would consider my definition rather broad compared to plenty of others.  PSO wasn't that big. You could only have 4 people in combat at once and all the content was instance based levels you just teleport to.  There's 9 dungeons and 3 classes total.  You see most the content really quickly and the game loop turns into repeating it over and over.\n\nThe game never really called itself an MMORPG either.   FFXI was advertised as an MMORPG.",
            "You've pretty much described Guild Wars 1 just now. Only groups of 4 people's instances worlds only being able to see everyone in the cities, etc. \n\nIs Guild Wars 1 also not an MMO?"
