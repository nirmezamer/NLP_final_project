Other timeline was no trunks. He IT back to kill frieza.  That was his plan.\n\nSpends 3 years training his son.  Another 1 year in the time chamber.  He witnessed gohans strength and known full well that Gohan was their only choice against Cell.\n\nCell was already stamina deprived.  It wouod be easy for him to get desperate like he does later.  Hence the senzu bean. Goku had complete confidence in his son. He was absolutely horrified finding out gohan didn't like fighting.\n\nI know what your gonna say bad father.  That would be a no.  He knew gohan wanted to.be a scholar yet everytime he chased gohan down He was fighting on the Frontlines and chose to train with goku for 4.5 years.  That's all he's ever witnessed of gohan after age 4.\n\nGoku picked up after his son and sacrificed himself against Cell.\n\nHe chose to stay dead because everything was linked to him.  From red ribbon to his saiyan biology.  What happens the one day he visits.   Vegeta goes on a tantrum and unleashes majin buu trying to settle an old grudge.\n\nHe supported gohans studies.  He embraced his new son.  And spent 4 years before beerus with his family.  10 years in GT.\n\nStill took brakes to come.home between training and crises in super.\n\nHe straight up apologies to gohan that he had to become a fighter again in super.  Because he wants his son to persue his dreams as a scholar.\n\nYou know dam well that gohan clapping videls cheeks is because ofnhis father's training.  It wasn't his brain during her in at first",

I can\u2019t see why something like Freiren is in the eyes of the average anime watcher, better than FMAB. \n\nI know people will downvote me to death, but I am open to discuss this with everyone who genuinely thinks this anime is something else.",

            "I don't think it's hard to see how it is perceived better than fmab. As amazing fmab is, it is dated. In terms of production quality, it can't compare. I think I watched fmab 5 times (in 3 different languages lol) and even so I remember the frieren soundtrack more. \n\nThe genres are different. At the end of the day fma is a shounen with lots of fighting and edgy themes. I think a large part of the anime community on Mal matured enough to appreciate the more adult themes of frieren more than the edge of fma. On the other hand, kids would enjoy the insane animation in frieren more than the also fantastic but older fmab. \n\nAnother thing is that frieren is not finished yet. The story is still unfolding. It has a great premise, so far, great world building, characters and actions that seem real. A lot more real than fmab. \n\nOf course, we have the meme culture as well, making frieren even more popular.",
            "For me, Frieren was like a refreshing appetiser in a sea of action packed hard hitting animes. It didn't try to be revolutionary or the next big thing, which was rather refreshing as an anime viewer.

Everytime something passed it before, however, people lost their shit and went to try and correct the timeline by artificially lowering the score of the \"offending\" anime.",
            "Frieren has had the top spot for 6 months now, they havent been at the top for awhile",
            "I sm sorry but calling FMA edgy and Freiren adult is something that goes beyond me. But I\u2019m not gonna talk about FMA here rn. \n\nHow specifically Freiren analyzes mature themes? Are you talking about the passage of time, the mourning of the past, the feeling of loss? \n\nWell, the depiction of those themes while being present, don\u2019t carry the weight of the actual feelings because the situations where they play out don\u2019t translate the level of importance. \n\nAnd this is not fault of the story itself, is fault of the rhythm of the anime and how little we get to know about their secondary or episodic characters.  The problem is not that the show is slow, the problem is that is not slow enough. \n\nTake for instance, something from other genre just to think about how characters are build, March Comes in Like a Lion. A lot of characters and a lot of dimensions, but the story makes sure you get involved with every aspect of their nature. You know them, their personalities, goals, frustrations and limitations so when something meaningful happens you can feel the weight of the emotion, you know something important is going on because we can see Hinata going through it, Kiriyama by her side and the Kawamotos actually suffering or enjoying and the implications of that emotions show.\n\nSadly with Freiren we get some good heavy themes but we don\u2019t know much about how the gang is dealing with the aftermath or the process of those themes and emotions. The characters just don\u2019t carry the weight because they are incapable to do it, the anime is designed to move fast even when people say it is slow. \n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t get much of a characterization in 23 minutes of a secondary or episodic character or situation, as I stated in other comment, just look at Mushishi or Violet Evergarden or even Fruits Basket. \n\nMy point is, while it is true that Freiren goes in with beefy subjects, it just doesn\u2019t make much with them. \n\nFor being an \u201cadult\u201d anime (which I think is actually very juvenile) it is really hollow because its characters don\u2019t have the spine to deal with mature themes.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think the \u201cgenres are different\u201d card plays here. You can make a good depiction of any theme in any genre but you characters have to know how to deal with them.",
            "That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. Freiren doesn\u2019t do anything quite important to be considered the top dog. People tend to praise it because of its slow, daily life dynamics but a lot of the time on screen the characters don\u2019t engage in something actually that meaningful besides their personal past and I have to say, it is really not that interesting as well.  \n\nJust look at every single bit of Freiren remembering Himmel, how does she portrays him? Wise, a little dorky, courageous, perfect in every single way but nothing else. Freiren\u2019s own observations of a person he values that much and spent quite a while with him are pretty much shallow. Is she really trying to understand more about the human nature? What is she learning about it? \n\nSome people will say Freiren\u2019s lessons are subtle in its own way but look at another example of a journey based anime like Mushi shi. Its episodic events actually try to explain something about the people Ginko meets and how they affect his own journey. \n\nWith Freiren most of the time the party is traveling from point A to point B and we don\u2019t see much of the world the people are living in, we don\u2019t see that much of the characters doing anything more than the job in turn. The episodic plots are so thin we can\u2019t get that much for our time. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m old and I like my anime being super deep, but I need to know why Freiren is the cr\u00e8me of the cr\u00e8me right now.",

            "You wanted a discussion, but all you can do is bash frieren, lol\n\nI think your mistake was thinking that said themes have to define the entirety of a character. Just like how Violet's whole personality is that she doesn't understand people and emotions which is actually rather similar to frieren. Nov, take a look at how the two shows handle that. In violet it is dramatically shown that with a heartless letter she wrote. While in frieren it is shown with a small interaction between frieren and stark when frieren says she can't help him with fern being angry at him. The themes linger trough the show tho, if you could catch them, then it's your fault. \n\nI think the show actually handles secondary characters much better than you think. But it is trough the lens of frieren, in an awkward way. You say the show is not slow enough to give time to these characters while violet and mushishi does it so much better? It is weird because both of those shows have very little main story and mostly just episodic stuff which leaves more time to explore those secondary characters. For example in violet if there were no secondary characters then there would be no characters because violet is basically an empty shell for almost all of the episodes (and where she isn't,  in the movie it sucked ass). \n\nAnd you do this again, you just say a show that I categorized as an adult show is juvenile just because. No explanation. \nIf you think the characters are not dealing with the mature themes then you watched a different show. I think the subtleties of the show lost on you. \n\nOf course the genre card plays a huge role here. You are comparing an episodic, in your face drama (violet) to a longer running, adventure fantasy. The only similarity these shows have is the absolutely gorgeous animation in both.",
            "Yeah, I do agree with what you said about Frieren not deserving of the top spot, the same reason why I still prefer Fmab over Frieren despite giving both a 10/10. I guess since frieren is all around a good anime, there isn't much to hate about it for most people, hence such a high rating. And then there's also a significant group of people who artificially rated it high cause they wanted to dethrone fmab, although that should also be offset by the fmab stans who just rate it low.",

            "New game db sparking zero coming soon",
            "The only exception to this is probably their arcade series Gundam Extreme Versus, which only is popular in Japan.",
            "Nothing will change my mind about that in term of income Gundam anime is just a long advertisement for model kits, games are just an afterthought (especially GBO2 on PC).",
            "They literally had From Software exclusivity at some point, who makes some of the best mecha games and made really good Gundam games, and just didn't do anything with that fact.",
            "They took 17 years to release Tenkaichi 4 despite consistent demand for it the entire time, are you surprised? Heck I wouldn't be surprised if they only started working on it as their \"oh shit\" button when they realized how things were trending.",
            "As a Barbatos main myself, he was very easy to counter. He was a one trick pony with his combo, and if he couldn't land it, he was a sitting duck. The RX-78 absolutely dumpsters Barbatos.",
            "Turns out things don't get very popular in regions where they aren't available.\n\nAlso Bandai, release Bonds of the Battlefield to international markets, it's not too late (maybe it is too late)",
            "God I wish we could get the new versus game on console right now. I'm ass at those games but man is it fun to play.",
            "God I play gbo2 a lot but it's because I like the game not its shitton of issues, and on PC it's even worse.",
            "Are there model kits based on *Witch From Mercury*?",
            "The longer I live, the more I think that japanese execs hate money",
            "I just want them on steam too :(",
            "[Yup, quite a lot, with most being an HG.](https://myfigurecollection.net/?current=orEntries&categoryId=10&rootId=0&orEntries%5B%5D=271124&_tb=item&mode=browse&tab=search&output=2&sort=insert&order=desc&year=2024&month=6&domainId=-1), I wonder whether Bandai will be bothered to make Hipelis and Clibarri kits.",
            "They made a Japan exclusive Gundam Unicorn game on the PS3, then went right back to Armored Core and Dark Souls. One of the best Gundam games ever made imo.",
            "they just don't care about oversees and mainly focus on japan for there shit",
            "They're not on steam?"
