            "They both played the Bilbo that was needed at the time.",
            "I like both, but personally, I prefer Ian Holm's version. For me, Holm just disappears into his role as Bilbo. I see Ian Holm's Bilbo and think, \"There's Bilbo.\" With Martin Freeman's version, I am always keenly aware that it's Martin Freeman playing a character. I'll see Martin Freeman as Bilbo and think, \"There's Martin Freeman playing Bilbo. Man, I should really rewatch Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy!\"\n\nWhile it has nothing directly to do with his performance as Bilbo, I also like the link Holm establishes with another great adaptation of The Lord of The Rings. Back in the 1980s, the BBC produced a radio play of LoTR. Ian Holm was also in that adaptation as the voice of Frodo. Another notable actor in that adaptation was Bill Nighy as Sam. The radio play also featured two actors who reprised their roles from the animated 1970s Bakshi adaptation: Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum and Michael Graham Cox as Boromir. Because most of the radio play's dialogue was lifted nearly word-for-word from the books I have an odd experience re-reading them where I visualise the actors from Jackson's movies in my head, but hear the voices from the radio play when I read their dialogue.",
            "I do think Ian did the best, as he is the Bilbo I visualise every time. \nMartin is usually criticized for just playing the same character in every role he takes but I think he did great in presenting a younger version of of Ian\u2019s Bilbo",
            "Both did.",

            "Ian Holm 100%, he had much wider range as an actor and the character Bilbo that he played was one of contrast with a sinister edge due to having the ring for the years he did, Holm played it perfectly.\n\nThe Bilbo that Freeman played was a less complex character, it didn't require a broad performance. Not saying that Freeman was bad, he probably played it as well as anyone else at the time could have, but he was playing a character from a childrens novel.",
            "Holm. \n\nAnd he was also the best Frodo in the radio plays.\n\nI will not be convinced otherwise.",
            "Im in the minority here, but I thought Martin Freeman s Bilbo was very flat. Just the standard nose twitches, stutters and quircks that he always dous. There wasnt really any growth and or change. And it dousnt help that I cant look besides his real personality that he is just a Prick in real life. Sorry thats just how I feel.",
            "They are playing different versions of Bilbo. \n\nI like the old one, but that's probably because I enjoyed the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole (with Fellowship of the Ring being the best out of the three) and as such I am going to like it more than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which is a nice movie, but not as good. It may also be because I always liked the deeper look into the political setting of Lord of the Rings (the books) over the simple adventure of The Hobbit (the book).",

In LOTR, Bilbo is an old guy who strives for adventure, who wants to travel again and most importantly, who has been corrupted by the ring and is strained by its power.

Teflon also is really really unhappy about sticking to things which is why it's great for cooking food, but it's a coating. you can't have a pan made purely from Teflon, it's a metal pan with Teflon on it. which doesn't stick to metal. \n\nthe more you use it and the more you scrape against it the more Teflon you will eat. there is no way to prevent this, you can only slow it. this is why you might also hear people say don't use anything metal in a Teflon pan like a fork or spoon or even a metal whisk. \n\nthis also touches on the last bad thing about Teflon which isn't health related. they wear out. cast iron, stainless steel, and carbon steel pans will all last your lifetime, your daughter's lifetime, your granddaughter's lifetime, the Apocalypse, and the lifetime of the alien that dug it up 18,000 years in the future. Teflon pans will last somewhere around 5 years, or a month if you use a metal utensil while cooking.",

            "Again, most of what I can see online says that Teflon isn't unsafe to ingest. At most there can be traces of a harmful compound used in the production of Teflon, but this chemical isn't used anymore.\n\nWebsite after website says that non-stick cookware is safe to use as long as it doesn't get too hot. I'm just really confused how this entire Reddit thread all agrees that Teflon will be the death of us all, while the entire rest of the internet says its fine. What am I missing?",
