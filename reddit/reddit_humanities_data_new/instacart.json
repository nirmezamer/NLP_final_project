La croix is kinda garbage, but I'm trying to be healthier)\n\nI specifically stated I wanted a refund on the item if it was out of stock. I made sure to select that option and save it.\n\n I backed out of the app and was doing my own thing for a while when a notification came up, stating that my shopper had replaced it. I went into the app as quickly as possible to hit refund AGAIN and within 5 minutes, she had checked out with the wrong item. \n\nShe never made any attempt to chat me or tell me she was replacing it, never asked me what flavor I'd prefer to replace it with (if they had had another flavor that I liked, I honestly would have been ok with a replacement). She just checked out. I'm pissed. \n\nI always tip well, at least 20% if not more depending on the distance of the store...\n\nI contacted support and they told me I have to wait until it's delivered for them to be able to do anything about it.\n\nHonestly I'm over using this stupid app. None of the shoppers seem to care anymore \ud83d\ude14 The good ones all got pushed off the app by the shit pay... I used to get awesome shoppers every time, a few years ago. ",

            "In some instances it is the speed of the available internet. Both of my ALDIs in Wausau have abysmally slow internet throughout the store either on their IC network or using my cell service. Do shopper may not see the guidances\nBut that is certainly no excuse for not observing you requested refund on that item. IC has this little line that you can SUGGEST an alternative item when the original one is unavailable, but if I saw refund I would only suggest in chat and take a photo of options & let you decide.",
            "I had a fantastic delivery yesterday. Shopper was fast, great communication on replacements. Pre-tipped $20 on a $100 order (15 units including 3 12packs of soda). I had no idea it had started to POUR rain during the delivery. Tipped an extra $10 afterward. \n\nSo many horror stories, figured I\u2019d post one about a good experience.",
            "IMHO, your problem is with Instacart. Their expectations for how quickly a shopper should complete an order are entirely unrealistic. They make it almost impossible for a shopper to provide the level of service they advertise and when something goes wrong they just blame the shopper when it fact, they essentially punish shoppers for getting an order \u2018right\u2019 and their training is basically \u201cfigure it out as you go\u201d.",
            "They are both green fruits what\u2019s the problem",
            "It's not always the shopper.   I always select refund if out of stock for the items I don't want to replace, but recently several shoppers told me the system asked them to select a replacement.  So sometimes I wonder those other times when some shoppers just picked a random replacement, if it's because the system told them to.  Now I select refund if out of stock, plus putting in comment 'no replacement'.  I use the web to order not the app.   And it's the grocery store's website.  I don't know if the instacart web has the same issue.  But instacart web has the problem of not refreshing the chat message so I often thought there was no response when I chat with a shopper.",
            "Don't forget to tip extra bc it's their birthday /s",
            "I feel you OP and it\u2019s extremely annoying especially when you are the one who tips 20%+ everytime. Or when they refund something that you know is definitely in stock\u2026 There has been several times when I have had to have Instacart send somebody else out and they found the item.",
            "Super weird that some shoppers just pick a random replacement.",
            "I now send a message as soon as I\u2019m assigned a shopper and let them know replacements are selected, and to pls let me know if they\u2019re also unavailable. It\u2019s still about 50% that they actually listen, many times I don\u2019t even get a response. But the other 50% the shoppers are great, follow instructions and IC is still much better than using Uber or other apps imo.",
            "In my version of the app (I have realized there are many versions out there, Instacart using us as guinea pigs to try out different features in different regions), it's impossible to replace an item if the customer has requested a refund on it. The app only gives you the option to refund. If the customer asks for a replacement after the fact (which a lot of them do - super annoying, since they requested a refund), it has to be added as a new item.",
            "Shopper is wrong, but to validate a bit, sometimes instacart will select refund when you want a replacement, or replacement when you want a refund, so you have to text the customer 99% of the time.",
            "Are mods blocking new threads? \nShoppers seem to replace with the non-sale item. Drives me nuts. Why you think I want $7 bread if the one I chose was $2.99 on sale and thry got another flavor of the sane bread on sale for $2.99? Common sense ain't that common.",
            "I had an order today , fixed tip, he refunded Everything even water without asking or messaging. He continued to act like items weren\u2019t there then I explained where they were located. He still continued to not communicate and refund more. \n\nThis is what you get when you do a fixed tip sometimes. I was perfectly polite but he was not interested. I would never lower a tip but he missed like $40 worth of food so his tip is 8$ higher than it should be\u2026 and he was just rude. What to do?",
            "Agreed,  I marked no replacement on each item.  Then the shopper sends request to replace the salad, so I replied Y followed by, No more replacements.  followed by shopper wishes to replaced spicy wings for non spicy wings   I replied N,  he replies, you already approved the salad,  I replied, Y to the salad N \"No\" to replacing spicy wings for plain wings\"  He replied be more specific OMG!!   I was like wtf??  I replied Do NOT replace the wings, and no more replacements,  10 minutes later  shopped wants to replace the salad and the wings, now I was pissed,  while I was typing No!  Stop cancel the order refund it all keep the tip,  he replied  Shopper has checked out and will be there in 20 minutes in a happy cheery reply,  I replied with a thumbs down,  then I got a text your order has been cancelled, it will take up to 3 weeks to reimburse your card and 15.00 cancellation fee of still applies.  So i contacted them on the app and copy and pasted the entire text log, and after twenty minutes they finally said they would waive the cancellation fee as well but it will take up to 3 weeks to clear.",
            "My customers would also send a brief message about replacements in the chat at the start of their batch just as a secondary precaution\u00a0",
            "they can wave their tip goodbye if they ignore my instructions AND attempt to chat to remedy. it's annoying enough when they ignore the preference & I have to go in and manually ask them to follow what I already instructed. if they ignore THAT too? byeeee\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8",
            "I'm surprised anyone is willing to do the sht at all for what they pay.",
            "Do you not get notified of changes being made during the shopping? You can just tell them not to get it before they check out with it.",
            "I always message and ask. Unless its something like grahm crackers, ir canned goods with a different brand/similar price. I wont replace an entirely different flavor tho. What makes ppl think someone ordered lime but wants peach? Its totally different flavors! Idiots. \n\nHowever, I will say that Insta does dox/lower our tip depending on how many items we refund vs replace. They urge us to find a replacement and we must click thru several stages just to br able to refund something. Refunding is the utmost LAST option avail according to Insta. But I put myself in my customer's place and think, \"I dont want to pay for something I didn't order and didn't click as my replacement. \nI think its fkd up insta takes part of our tip away if we have to refund several items. But thats just how it is unless the customer goes back after delivery & fixes it.",
            "I bet Instacart does these replacing items issues on purpose , they offer you a small gesture of a 5$ credit that don't cover the lost sales tax , service fees , tips , and applicable delivery cost hoping you will reuse their service & pay further fees . I stopped using them they are a bunch of low life scammers",
            "YES!! I was literally JUST going to post about this!!! I EXPLICITLY configure in the app that I don't want a replacement. AND THEY REPLACE IT ANYWAY!?!?!?",
            "Some shoppers just don\u2019t read the replacement  options.\nI evenv had one shopper write that she will chose the replacement when she accepted my order.  I chatted with her and told her no you need to ask and look at order replacement.",
            "Ultimately it's on you to go to the store and get the items yourself.",
            "Just select pickup instead of delivery for orders on instacart. There's no tip required. They credit money back to you for pickup. The prices aren't inflated, and you actually get what you order because its usually store employees (for aldi) doing the shopping so they know the stock. I have so much better service this way. All you need to do is drive into the pickup lane, and they load it into your car for you. I took the advice from all the undertipped instacart shoppers to do it myself, and instacart actually pays me to come pick up my groceries with cash back. Thank you all for showing me the way! Shopping stress is down, and my wallet is up!",
            "Sometimes there are problems with the app legitimately but as someone who has run orders in the past it is annoying when someone marks refund on everything.\u00a0 This is especially annoying if placed on all items on current sale at the end of day because it will all be gone.\u00a0 When you refund a bunch, especially if the tip is based on percentage of sale, this can eat up profit quickly from what you were expecting to make.\u00a0 I have seen an order go from $30 to half that and became totally not worth it in the end because I still had to spend all the time figuring out half of everything was not in stock.\u00a0 While I wouldn't replace items I know where on refund a lot of shoppers aren't willing to let that extra cash go and force replacements.",
            "This is not an I told you so but this is the reason why I always make sure I follow them closely while they shop - I specifically select Priority because I know I will be available for that amount of time.\n\nMost of my shoppers are really very good and do honor my Refund and so what I actually will get is their telling me that Cherry Garcia is out of stock and do I want a different flavor - a real example :-)\n\nHowever this morning I place an order for a 2 pound container of strawberries which was $10.00. Evidently they were out of stock and so the shopper replaced with two 1 pound containers which actually is very logical and can't fault them as I had indicated a 2 pound container of strawberries was fine as a replacement. However 2 one pound containers were $15.00 as opposed to one 2 pound container so I texted him to cancel and refund and explained why.\n\nI don't think shoppers are generally aware of how much items are in the App so I can't fault them because it was such a logical replacement.\n\nAnd strawberries are very weird in the App because literally there will be the identical item as a replacement choice. So I don't know whether it is a glitch or whether one is Driscolls (a brand where I live) or generic.",

            "You tip % and a good %. This means refunds = I lose money \n\nTip flat.",

Even when we think we are fast, it ain't fast enough. \n\nIt's not like the pizza guy/girl where five bucks is enough. The pizza guy ain't shopping for hours like instacart people. \n\nIt takes about three minutes for each item to shop, instacart only pays peanuts below below min. Wage. When an order takes 1-2 hrs plus delivery time....and the order is only paying 10 bucks or 14 bucks ... From Instacart and it takes 5 in gas to deliver, it ain't worth taking any orders. It's the tips that make it worth it. 20+ dollars in tips makes all the difference in the world . \n\nTop everything off, we gotta pay our own taxes on poverty pay.",
            "I kinda ran off track. But yes I agree they should refund if instructions say so. The problem is..... When you put 20% tip and that person refunds..... It takes away from the 20% tip. So replacing it keeps a couple bucks in their pockets",
            "20% is good. If you put a flat rate tip in.... Address it in the notes for the shopper then it won't matter to replace it.",
            "If you think that was bad; Let me just say the more I use IC the less impressed I am. Today I placed a delivery order from Publix  5 of the items where BOGO. on all  I hit the add to cart once. The 5 items I ordered as BOGO One item came as BOGO one item I got two of I was charged twice for so not BOGO keep in mind I only hit add once on this item of the other three I only got one of. It took 15 minutes to contact CS via Publix CS. then on hold for 10 minutes and once I got answered and playing 20 questions she told me I needed to talk to another dept. She transferred me and as soon the next person answer they hung up on me. I will give them they did call me back. So after the same questions again she said she did not see the items as BOGO when I pointed out I was on the IC page to place an order it clearly said BOGO on each of the items only then did she say she saw the BOGO. I was then told that the reason I did not get BOGO on those items was because I did not add each item twice.  So when I asked why did I get BOGO on the one item that I had only added once and that every last order on BOGO I only had to add one. She said she would pass the problem onto Tech Support and made no offer of correcting my problem. The icing on the cake was when I had to show the de3liver guy my ID and he could not get the photo thing to work and we spent 5 minutes putting my ID information in by ha",
            "Sometimes I\u2019m in a hurry and don\u2019t notice it said \u201crefund\u201d on specific items, the other day I was zooming thru and one of the items said to refund and I was like oh shit\ud83d\ude05I wonder if any of the others have said that too. Cus a lot of times, only some items people prefer refunds, and others they\u2019ll still take a sub. But in this case, I would have never picked a different flavor completely. If the flavor was gone, no diff size or anything, that would\u2019ve been an immediate \u201cnot available\u201d",

Some dashers get frustrated because what was suggested as a substitution isn\u2019t available and neither is the original item this could be caused by a popular item being frequently bought or inventory not being properly documented to keep stock from the store behalf. Some just automatically hit refund if they can\u2019t find the item in a short timely matter or have checked and there are no items available. We get docked of how much time we spend in the grove store for looking for things it also effects the overal ratings as a dasher as well.

I marked every single item as refund if out of stock (even the item that they said they had tons of in stock) just because I prefer to have my choice of replacements/refunds in before a shopper is even assigned.\n\nI guess from here on out, I'm going to physically add a note saying \"DO NOT REPLACE!

Maybe the app was glitching out and the shopper could not get a hold of you, so they refunded bc that \"preference\" was saved.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I 1st started, there was a star which showed us THE CUSTOMER made the refund/replacement choice vs it being an instacart recommendation. I don't know why they changed it. They've made so many changes that make it hard for us to know what customers really want.\u00a0\n\n\nThere have been times I refund or even replace bc it says this is what \"Diane prefers.\" Only for Diane to message me that she wants otherwise. And just like in this case, it makes me look incompetent or like I'm giving bad service.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd going back to time. Idk how many times I have to explain something to a customer about the platform and uncertainty of it, bc they assume it's me being special vs the poor design/programming.\n\n\nYour best bet? Leave notes under items what you would like replacement refund wise. Those auto save too. So you should only need to type them in once and those notes will save on future orders. As a customer as well, it's what I do as well.\u00a0",

Even if I got the email beforehand customer service says bc IC already gave me coupons to two stores i was only BROWSING at (have no carts for and never ordered from), I need to use those or wait 2 wks til they expire to use the $40 off my next 2 orders! \n\nAnd just as bad: they say the -$40X2 coupon was sent to EVERY IC customer in the country and only 300 ppl could use it ...\n And the 1.5 hours between me receiving it and being on the phone w CS it was all used up so even if I cancel and do my whole dang cart again, I cant even use the coupon!

I haven't used the service since, and likely won't again, simply because this isn't the first time something like this has happened. \n\nI used to be super thankful for this service, but the quality went majorly downhill over the past few years. The shoppers in my area used to be awesome! And I would always tip accordingly, and usually increase the tip if service was exceptionally good. \n\nNormally, I'd just go shopping myself and not bother, but as stated in some other comments, I was actually sending my shopper to get medicine, and only got the extra items to meet the minimum cart value. (I mean, paying elevated prices for everything in addition to tip, service fee, small cart fee, and delivery fees isn't exactly worth it.) I only ever use the service when home sick or otherwise stuck at home without access to a car. \n\nIn this instance, I was home sick, and my roommate took the car to work. It was sort of a double whammy situation. Hell, I even take lyfts to the shops if needed most times, if I'm without a car but not home sick. I don't like spreading germs unnecessarily so I chose to use this service.\n\nAll of this to say, I agree to an extent! I was thankful for the service, when there was actually something to be thankful for. I get that training is basically non-existent, and pay isn't great, but it was such a simple fix, and yet no attempts were made from the shopper's side. I felt slighted, but it's so minute in the large scheme IDGAF anymore haha\n\nI was honestly just ranting to commiserate with some others who have shared similar experiences.",

That does not mean they want you to pick a random substitute. It means they would like you to refund the item. \n\nThey didn\u2019t need to respond. They already put in the app what they wanted to happen if it was out of stock. Same way you can pick what item you want as a substitute when something is out of stock.\n\nBut yes I would expect picking the \u201cRefund if out of stock\u201d option would mean my shopper would \u2026\u2026 refund it if it\u2019s out of stock?

All you need to do is drive into the pickup lane, and they load it into your car for you.

The thing is, if a shopper takes an order & ends up canceling it, the new shopper can see all mesgs between the previous shopper & customer. I've seen mesgs saying most if not all of the customers' items are out of stock. I always get discouraged b/c I don't accept orders for the shitty batch pay, I accept them for the tips. So if a person's order is out of stock, I'll only get the batch pay, which, imo, SUCKS. So I go into the store to check it out & find that ALL of the customer's items are actually *IN* stock!! So these shoppers lie & say stuff is out of stock (they probably don't even go into the store) so they just get the batch pay. They probably do this all day long & make a bunch of $ b/c they don't even attempt to shop! It's messed up & makes the honest shoppers (like myself) look bad.

Sure, they maybe didn\u2019t have the size/brand of spaghetti sauce on my order, but I\u2019m positive they had a different size jar, or a different brand, or some other sauce option entirely. When the rest of my order is ground beef, a box of pasta, and Parmesan cheese, it seems like it should be obvious that I\u2019m not making anything without some sort of sauce.\n\nI guess I do also understand the refund-default mindset, though. It\u2019s faster, and it\u2019s probably easier to tell a reasonable customer that \u201cthey didn\u2019t have 16oz cans\u201d than it is to deal with to a belligerent customer who flips out because (2) 8oz cans don\u2019t fit in their cupboard as well.",

I gave him five stars, I decided not to deduct one for packing and leave him a note instead.  I still upped his tip for being so good with communication. Also I requested him to shop for me again. I want the note that says if I ever do get you again can you please use bags instead of one big box because it\u2019s too heavy for me to lift and I\u2019ll pay for the bags.

She said she could not accept it over the phone but had to open my account to add it which I could not access. I then said use my Costco list which was free and I did not have to use my expired Visa.

He empathized with my problem and said he would immediately email the forms to my [charter.net](http://charter.net) address. I was instructed to open up my input and spam folder but there was nothing. OK then, he then said my linked account would be reactivated within 48 H and a specialized team would email the solution to my problem. That never happened.\n\nI worked as a General Manager for Hilton Hotels and problems occasionally occurred, especially when my employee made the mistake, but I tried to minimize a bad guest's experience and resolve the problem, that was my purpose. This seems my problem is being passed around and no one is willing to step up and solve my problem.\n\nI have been fooled again. It is obvious that Instacart operators and special agents are only told what to say by the management but was never given nor taught the power to solve any problems, Unfortunately, it is a disservice to guest as well as employees, that is how they learn problem solving skills not parroting words of management.

I hope it was an honest mistake but I have to say, why in the world would someone redeem a gift card to an account that was no longer active, that never had any activity on it, and to an account whose email was probably inactive anyway. When the mistake was made, it would be easy to transfer the credit to correct account, it happens all the time, but because of the profitability policy, that could never happen. Why was the Costco grocery list the operator had paid for was mysteriously canceled and the account deactivated. It is because of profitability. Finally, why were there 3 operators never able to email the reactivation forms to my [charter.net](http://charter.net) email. Once again it is a profitability policy. The idea of grocery delivery was a good one, especially for the elderly unable to drive, but Instacart has a lot of financial issues and I have been reading a lot of horror story reviews. They have a tendency to lower their principles for profitability which is never a good thing but doesn't everyone. I have now accepted the idea that the gift card problem will never be resolved and I will never buy anything from Instacart again.

The scooter probably isn\u2019t going to cut it and you\u2019re going to be waiting forever for orders you can actually accept. But if you\u2019re somewhere like a city, where people are more likely to be ordering for 1-2 person homes, scooters can definitely get the job done - I see scooters and motorcycles doing delivery all the time in San Francisco.\n\nI would think you\u2019d have more luck delivering takeout than groceries on that either way, so you may want to consider Door Dash/UberEats/etc over Instacart, but again it\u2019s going to depend a lot on your area and what\u2019s available.",

I feel bait and switched and support said they couldn't do anything about it. Is this normal with this app?",
            "I used Instacart for first time today because car is damaged and I finally ran out of food. Heard so many bad things and also wary of having someone else shop for produce but decided to try it. I don\u2019t have \u201cfuck you\u201d money (those days long gone).\n\nIt was perfect. Got 3 weeks worth of food. Every item delivered (I already told them no substitutions), produce in excellent condition, exactly what I wanted. I tipped 20% because no one is getting rich working as a shopper, and also hoped that might help me have a good experience. Thank you shopper Marcus from Iowa!\n\nI know it will not always be perfect. People are people. Still glad to know I can get groceries delivered when needed.",

            "I get the OP aggravation because shoppers deal with more than customers truly understand. They could have asked in a more graceful manner but too late for that. I think the point here is if you are particular about certain items get them yourself and just have shoppers pick up items that you don\u2019t mind replacements for or certain flavors or brands don\u2019t matter to you. If you are particular, put in the notes sections of the items \u201crefund only\u201d or \u201cno replacements\u201d. Or even ask them in the notes to send you photos of available options before replacing. \n\nAnd to the shoppers: stop throwing anything in the cart just so your pay doesn\u2019t decrease. Do your job with integrity or don\u2019t do it at all. Trying to stiff people will keep you in a moral and financial deficit. \n\nIf a customers requests a replacement and I send photos and they don\u2019t respond to what option they want, I let them know if I don\u2019t hear from them before checkout, I\u2019m refunding the item . Because I\u2019m not about to hear from no one I picked out items they didn\u2019t like. Yea my pay might go down a couple dollar but it\u2019s already freaking low. What the point of being dishonest/doing a bad job over 2-5 dollars. All you gonna do is make the customers who can take or leave using instant LEAVE Instacart. And when customers are low\u2026where is your money going to come from then? So stop being greedy .\n\n Anyway  so to the customers: there are still good shoppers out there, when you get one l, tip them more at the end  if you can. Word will spread and maybe the lazy/inconsiderate shoppers will tighten up because they want the money more than anything.\n\nThis is my 2 cents. Take it or leave it and have a blessed day.",

All you need to do is drive into the pickup lane, and they load it into your car for you.

Today, my shopper did just that and even decided to get all the perishable items 1st including frozen food. Plus the delivery handoff was awful and he forgot stuff. He is being removed from my account. Why do a job if they're not going to do it well? We shouldn't have to beg for the bare minimum when this isn't a luxury for everyone.
