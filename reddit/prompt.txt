"BBC Copyright: BBC\n\nThere are 17-and-a half days to go until polls open on 4 July for the UK general election.\n\nAs Transport Secretary Mark Harper pointed out this morning, a small number of postal votes will already have been cast. But, for the rest of us, here are some key dates:\n\nThe deadline to register to vote is 23:59 BST on Tuesday. The deadline to apply for a postal vote is 17:00 BST on Wednesday.\n\n(The deadline to apply for a postal vote in Northern Ireland has already passed).\n\nYou’re also able to apply for a proxy vote before 17:00 BST on 26 June (that deadline has also already passed in Northern Ireland).\n\nThe Electoral Commission has more details if you need further help – you can access that here .",
