At tier 1 and especially mid tier 2 Id argue that Sorcerers are the most powerful class due to metamagic and this is the most played tiers. \n\nEspecially when you consider they get a lot of their negatives due to low spell selection is negated by newer subclasses. Metamagic destroys action economy by allowing you to cast a cantrip and a leveled spell in one turn with twin spell. \n\nA variant human or custom Lineage could get a Eldritch blast plus agonizing blast combo going at level 5 and quicken spell out a fireball plus use Eldritch blast twice per long rest before running out of metamagic. \n\nThey could also get their dex to 16 or take a hexblade dip to do a quicken booming blade/ gfb combo and get decent damage plus a high leveled spell out in the same turn. Wizard cannot take advantage of the hexblade dip as well due to having int being their primary casting stat.\n\nFor DMs that aren't giving out frequent long rests twin spell on haste (level 5) giving two melee characters in your party a buff equivalent to multiple levels. Or twin spelling polymorph at level 7 which is think might be the most broken thing any character can do at that level rules as intended. Basically giving two PCs a combined 254 temporary hit points and potential dpr buff. \n\nI agree around 5th level spells Wizards are on par with Sorcerers then 6th level spells they are stronger. By then your campaign is probably either over or almost over but a level 17 Wizard is so broken it's not funny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's a bit mind-boggling, but in three short months, we just hit 60K!\n\nWe didn't expect this next milestone to happen this quickly, but it's definitely a testament to the passion people still have for collecting physical media...and we're all for it!\n\nWe've had a blast seeing more collectors join the community, seeing new collectors take the dive by posting their first hauls, and seeing everyone watch each other's backs with posting sales and release information.

It's incredibly reassuring knowing that collectors are out there --- and that this hobby will continue to endure. \n\nSo, you guys know what time it is...It's time for another giveaway!

Your comment *must contain the following*, or else it will be considered invalid:\n\n1. Please start the post with the three (3) films listed above that you want to enter for! (Winners will only receive one code, but this will give you an opportunity to win other films if your first selection is won by someone else). \n2. After identifying which films you're entering for, please write about a film you're still (unfortunately) waiting on to get a 4K Blu-ray release! Tell us why you're waiting for this film specifically (perhaps get into depth as to what the film means to you, what you're hoping 4K/HDR can bring to the table, how long you've been waiting, etc.). Effort is important here -- we like meaningful entries, not just one line comments.\n\nAnd it's as easy as that! Winners will be selected by **July 5th, 2024**. We will post the winners here and tag them. We appreciate ALL of you for being a part of this community. Thank you so much for making it what it is today.

With that in mind, for those receiving advice, remember to take recommendations here with a grain of salt as well.\n8. **Do not delete posts, especially submissions under a throwaway**. Once a post is deleted, it can no longer be used as a reference tool for the rest of the community. Part of the benefit of asking questions here is to share the knowledge of others.

I had to remove dozens of them today as they began taking over the front page of /r/accounting.\n\nLast year the mod team added the following posting guideline based on feedback we received from the community. We believe this guideline has been successful in maintaining a front page that has a variety of content, while still allowing the community to retain the authority to vote on what kind of content can be found on the front page (and where it is ranked).\n\n__\n\nWe recommend posting follow-up messages/jokes/derivatives in the comment section of the first thread posted. For example - a person posts an image, and you create a similar image with the same template or idea - you should post your derivative of that post in the comment section. If your version requires significantly more effort to create, is very different, or there is a long period of time between the two posts, then it might be reasonable to post it on its own, but as a general guideline please use the comments of the initial thread.\n\n__\n\nThe community coming together over a joke that hits home, or making our own inside jokes, is something that makes this place great. However, it can be frustrating when the variety of content found here disappears temporarily due to something that is easy to duplicate turning into rehashing the same joke on the entire front page of this subreddit.\n\nThe mods have added this guideline as we believe any type of content should be visible on the front page - low effort goofy jokes, or serious detailed discussion, but no type of content should dominate the front page just because it is easy to replicate.",

His reaction obviously hurt my feelings and I was explaining why. He apologized and said this is exactly why he hates gifts and would\u2019ve appreciated being \u201csurprised\u201d by a gift. \n\n I put a great deal of effort into getting him things that I thought he would love and was excited to give him his gifts but his reaction left me confused, hurt and feeling rejected. \n\n\nAm I being dramatic or is he being ungrateful? \n\n\nEdit: thank you for all your comments. It seems my head already knows what to do in terms of this relationship but my heart still needs time to catch up. I do love him a lot but often wonder if I deserve better. ",

        "AI_comment": "You put a lot of effort into his gift and it's completely valid to be hurt by his reaction. It's great that he apologized, but he needs to understand that gifts aren't just about fulfilling a need, they're about expressing love and appreciation. Maybe he needs to learn how to better communicate his wants without making you feel like you failed. \n"

Faster CPU is the better Option .\n\nAE will use as much RAM as you have available.  It eats RAM like a fat kid in a candy store. The more you have the better it will be for you.\n\n\n##Performance\n\nAE works best if you do not have other apps running at the same time. Apps like Chrome are a resource hog and will slow your system down.\n\n\n##Install System Updates\n\n Depending on your GPU card...Make sure you have the **\"Creative Drivers\"** (AMD) OR the **\"Studio Drivers\"**(NVDIA) installed for your specific GPU and all other system drivers are up to date as well. **Note: Recent GPU drivers have been known to cause issues and you may need to roll  back 1 version to correct it.**\n\nAlso of Note: some system settings can cause crashes in windows OS.

Often it is a very simple OS setting tweek that will fix it. \n\n\n##Project Do's\n\n**SAVE YOUR PROJECT AS SOON AS YOU CREATE A NEW PROJECT AND RESAVE IT OFTEN** This turns on the auto save feature.  Make sure you know where the auto save file folder is located. Also saving a copy of a project on a separate drive is a good idea.\n\n**Name your layers.** Selecting a layer name and pressing **enter on the keyboard** will allow you to type in your own custom layer name.  Naming layers will allow you to find them again.\n  \n**Comps** can also be renamed by doing so in the project panel, using the same process as layers.\n\n**Precompose layers.** Go Menu, Layers, Pre-compose (ctrl/cmd + shift + C)  Some effects actually need the layer/s to be precomposed in order to work.  It also can help clean up your timeline.\n\n##Project Do NOT's\n\n**AE is not a video editor(NLE), it is a compositing software that is capable of animation. Do not edit footage in AE.**\n \n**Edit footage in an NLE such as Premiere.  Use AE for motion graphics and VFX's.**\n\n**Mp4** sources can and do cause issues in After Effects. Do not use mp4 in AE projects, Convert to Prores 422 or 444 first using Adobe Media Encoder. \n\n**MP4 is a lossy format & will just make your system have to work harder.** It will slow things down because your computer has to decompress the footage to make it usable. \nMp4 can also contain codecs that will give issues such as VFR (Variable Frame Rate) footage(Game footage and Go Pro, are most likely sources for this) \nThese are known to cause severe issues with AE.  Render all mp4's to Prores first using media encoder.\n\n**NO MP3.**  Use .wav or .aiff audio files. \n\n**Do not directly export to mp4 out of AE via Media Encoder.** Use AE native render engine. \n \n** Note: A 2 step render is preferable. First export as Prores using AE native render queue, then convert that file to mp4 via Media Encoder.**\n\n##Speeding Up Work Flow\n\nIf possible work in 1/2 to 1/4 resolution.  Change this back to full resolution before rendering.\n\n**Set Preview in 1/2 to 1/4 resolution in Preview control panel.**\n\nMake sure that there are no other apps running.  Including unseen apps in the background that are eating resources. **Note: Chrome is super resource intensive and should not be running while using After Effects.**\n\n**AGAIN Do not use compressed formats in AE; it only slows your system down.**\n\nDisable CPU and GPU intensive effects (example blur and glow) in the effects control panel by clicking the \"fx\" box in the panel next to the effect name OR in the \"fx\" box located in time line, during your creation process.  **Important: Turn them back on before rendering.**\n\n \n##Previews\n\n**You must allow AE time to render out/create a RAM preview before you can actually watch a preview.** \n\nThe Green Bar at the top of the time line is an indicator of RAM preview progress. \n\nA blue bar indicates frames that have been cached to hard drive memory. \n\nAE needs two or more frames for a RAM preview to work and will be based on your **Work Area Bar length.** You can adjust the work area bar by pressing the b and n keys in conjunction with the CTI(Current Time Indicator) placement\n\n**Preview Settings Control Panel** sets the frame rate for the preview and can allow you to skip frames when previewing which may be helpful in speeding up RAM preview and extending the length of the preview. You can also set RAM preview to be the length of your work area bar in the preview panel and may be helpful in conserving RAM.\n\nSetting preview to **auto** will make RAM previews at the preview window settings. If you are working at 1/4 resolution it will preview at 1/4 resolution.\n\nWork in 1/2 - 1/4 resolution.** This will extend your preview length and speed up RAM preview render time. Go Full quality when rendering out or you want to check final quality in the RAM preview.\n\nIf you are still having issues then play the time line through 1 time and it should play perfectly till you make a change to the layers/composition.\n\n\n##Comp and Time Line\n\nEverything runs in a composition OR \"Comp\" for short.\n\nComp Settings first appear when you create a new comp ctrl/cmd + N\n\nComps time duration can be adjusted via the Composition Menu at the top of the screen. **IF** you need to access the Comp drop down menu **Go: Menu, Composition, Composition Settings,** OR hotkey **ctrl/cmd + K**  to open the dialog box where you can set the composition: Size, Pixel Aspect Ratio, Frame Rate, Start Time and Duration.\n\n**00:00:00:00  =  Hours: Minutes: Seconds: Frames**\n\nA comp will only play the duration of the composition. If your footage is longer than composition duration it will not play past the end of the comp and you **must increase composition duration** or move the footage bar by dragging it to the right or left to the specific area you want shown in the project.\n\nMake sure you are not completely zoomed into the time line and showing each frame. Those number are not seconds they are frames when zoomed in completely. The slider bar at the bottom the time line panel can fix this. **Or see the hotkey section below for hotkey short cuts to zoom in and out of the time line.**\n\n**Composition settings** is where you set your Composition size, duration, frame rate, Pixel Aspect Ratio(**Be sure to select square pixels**)resolution and the back ground color(Note: background color does not render). In the advanced section tab you can set the anchor point location, preserve frame rate, preserve resolution when nested, motion blur and samples per frame **but for now you should leave those advanced settings alone**.\n\n##Cache\n\n**Clear your Cache often. Menu, Edit, Purge, All Memory and Disk Cache. ** 100GB dedicated to the cache is a good minimum, less than that and you will have to clear your cache more often to avoid errors and unwanted frames popping up in a comp.  Also of note: if you do not have enough free hard drive space available you will get an **\"out of memory\"** error.  Disk space is important in AE. It is great if you are able to dedicate an entire separate drive to the cache, but not all here have that luxury. Also Disk Cache should be located to your fastest drive. SSD are generally much faster than HDD.\n\n\n##Starting Out\n\nTake the time to learn the basics. **See side bar for beginner tut links.** There are also other Learning resources listed there. After that a search will get you tuts for pretty much anything you need. **Search** *how to do __X___ in After Effects*. \n\nThere are many, many free and paid learning resources and courses out there.\n\n\n##Panels\n\nIf you do not see a panel in your workspace you can access them by going **Menu, Window and selecting from the drop down list**.\n\n\n##Plugins\n\nThere are tons of free and paid plugins for After Effects; but you should know how to do the effect without them first. Plugins are meant to speed up work flow and should not be used in place of a lack of knowledge.\n\nA few free plugins I have used that you may find helpful:\n\n**Video Copilot:**\n\nSaber https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/saber_plug-in/\n\nFX Consul https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/fx_console_plugin/\n\nColor Vibrance https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/color_vibrance_plug-in/\n\nVC Orb https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/ultra_3d_earth/\n\nSure Target https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/sure_target_2/\n\n**Ukramedia:**\n\nDeLayer & Bouncr (scripts) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF_5I99MFZI\n\n**Plugin Everything:**\n\nThicc Stroke https://www.plugineverything.com/thiccstroke\n\n**RowByte**\n\nColor Wiggle https://www.rowbyte.com/color-wiggle\n\n **Motion Design School**\n\nhttps://motiondesign.school/products/motion-tools/\n\n##Learning\n\n**Learn the principles of Animation.** Books: \"The Illusion of Life\" and \"The Animators Survival Kit\" are good resources.\n\nAGAIN: **There are many paid and free learning resources out there a search will get you many courses to choose from; there are also educational links in the side bar.**\n\n##Keyframing\n\nOnce you have clicked on the stop watch icon you have set your first keyframe. \nAll additional keyframes will be made automatically for that property when you change parameters/value of that property.  Clicking the stop watch again removes all keyframes from that property.\n\nLearn to use the Graph Editor and Easing/Bezier keyframes. Select keyframes and press F9 hot key.\n\nUnless specified AE is set to Bezier keyframes by default and will cause issues with unwanted motion then using two keyframes of the same value over time.  If your object moves when it is not supposed too then it is because you have Bezier keyframes. Set them to linear.  \n\n**Set to linear keyframe in the Preferences.** Go Menu, Edit, Preferences, General and select checkbox: **Default Spacial Interpolation to Linear**. OR select keyframes and R Click on keyframe and select linear option from dialog box OR **ctrl/cmd + Alt + K** to open keyframe interpolation dialog box.\n\n\n##HotKeys\n\nLearn to use hotkeys and learn how to assign your own hotkey if one does not yet exist.\n\nSelect the layer and press a key. Some hotkeys to get you started:\n\n    a = opens anchor \n    p = opens position\n    r = opens Rotation\n    s = Opens Scale\n    t = Opens opacity\n    u = Open all layers with keyframes\n    uu = Opens and Closes all modified/edited properties\n    e = Opens and Closes Effects\n    ee = Opens and Closes Expressions \n    L = audio level keyframe\n    LL = show waveform\n    ctrl/cmd + M = Render Queue\n    Tab = Jump back to comp or inside the comp\n    shift + / = automatically fits comp view to fit up to 100% in viewer also handy to retrieve lost viewer\n    - and = keys on keyboard = zoom out and zoom in for the time line.\n    * on numpad = sets marker on selected layer if no layer selected then it set marker on work  area bar.\n    b and n = sets work area bar beginning and end in conjunction with CTI(Current Time Indicator) location\n    ctrl/cmd + D = Duplicates selected layer.\n    ctrl/cmd + shift + D = splits layer.\n    ctrl/cmd + z = Undo\n    ctrl/cmd + shift + z = Redo.\n    ctrl/cmd + Alt + K = Opens Keyframe Interpolation box\n    Alt/option + Mouse Wheel = Selects/scrolls open comps in time line panel\n\nThere are many more Hotkeys. To many to list them all. I will add that you can create your own hotkey short cut by going **Menu, Edit, Keyboard Short Cuts**  or (**ctrl + Alt + '** ) to open the keyboard short cut editor.\n\t\n\n\t\n##Renders\n\nAE mostly uses CPU for rendering except for certain effects.  A faster more powerful GPU may not help all that much.  A faster CPU is a better option when selecting a processor for your system.\n\nA render is always done inside of the **Work Area Bar** located at the top of the time line window. Using hotkeys B and N will set the beginning and end of the location of the Work area bar, make sure to move the CTI(Current Time Indicator) to the beginning and to the desired end before using  B and N hot keys. Also this sets work area for previewing and rendering.  \n\nYou can batch process Renders in the Render Queue so it is possible to make multiple videos; but only 1 per comp at a time.  However, you can set up multiple comps to be rendered one after the other in the Render Queue.\n\nLesser compression formats on the codec for renders = faster renders, but will have larger file size; but also will have higher quality. \n\n**Prores** is an intermediate compression codec.  A balance of good quality and lower file size than an uncompressed render.\n\n**Image Sequence** (.jpg, png) can be helpful especially if you are having, or are concerned about renders failing, and will allow you to pick back up at the place where the render failed or at least identify the frame to which the render failed so you can take corrective action in the composition. The down side is file size will be larger.\n\n**Render codec selection settings** can be changed by clicking on the **blue words** next to the words **Output Module** in the Render Queue. \n\n**To access or send a comp to  Render Queue use hot key (cmd/ctrl + M)**\n\nRepeating myself here with good reason: **A 2 step render is preferable. First export as Prores or Image Sequence(jpg or png) using AE native render queue, then convert that file to mp4 via media encoder.**\n\n##Speeding Up Renders\n\nMake sure that there are no other apps running in the background eating your system resources. This may also include apps that are unseen and may require you to modify how your system operates**(NOTE don't mess with your system unless you absolutely know what you are doing, you can cause yourself lots of problems including crash and making your system non bootable)** \n\nIf your system will support it use Multi-frame rendering Located in your Preferences.  GO Menu, Edit, Preferences, Memory and Performance and select the Enable Multi-Frame Rendering.\n\n I have had faster renders out of AE using AE native Render Queue than I have Media Encoder.  Remember that less compressed formats do render faster than highly compressed(lossy) formats.\n\nYou can also look into rendering apps like Render Garden.\n\nPressing **Caps Lock** suspends live render preview as it is rendering. It may help a bit.\n\nIf you system can handle it.... you can also try setting Video Rendering and Effects to **Mercury GPU Acceleration(OpenGL)** in the Project Settings.  **GO Menu, File, Project Settings, Video Rendering and Effects And choose from the drop down menu.**\n\n###Note: all media platforms recompress any footage you submit to them. It is best to render to the highest quality footage you can. Either increase your data rate for mp4 h264/5 or use a less lossy format such as mov Prores.\n\n##More Info\n\n**Note: Certain fonts do cause issues in AE.  If you are having problems like long render times or lagging on text animations try a different font as a stand in. Then replace the stand in font with the original choice for the final render, or use a different font entirely for the project**\n\n##Help\n\nIf you are having problems with After Effects this sub may be able to help. **But you do need to give as many details of the problem as possible and supply example links or screen shots of the issue, if possible.** While there are lots of experts on this sub nobody here is a mind reader. So **DETAILS** please.\n\n**Some problems are beyond the expertise of the members and contacting Adobe Support is a really good idea.**\n\nAdobe Support Help can be accessed via the After effects **Help** menu.  Direct link to Adobe support **https://helpx.adobe.com/support/after-effects.html?mv=product&mv2=ae** Be sure to use the chat feature at the bottom right of the page to get immediate help.\n\nThe Adobe site also has a help forum and can be accessed in the help menu at the top of the screen under **HELP**  with many other links also available.\n\n##Other Resources\n\n**User Guide**\n\nLink to AE User Guide https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/user-guide.html\n\n\n##Expressions\n\nLearn a few basic expressions as they will save you a ton of work. Example: LoopOut(); wiggle(); Random(); and linear(); will save you so much work instead of trying to keyframe everything.\n\nThis is more advanced subject matter but I will include it. Link to AE Expressions Guide https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language-reference.html \n\nExpressions run on javascript coding with a few minor caveats.  AE does not store values in memory and relies on CTI time for advancing calculations.\n\nThe w3school is an excellent source of learning javascript, its free and in depth resource based on website js https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp There are many youtube videos as well.\n\n##Scripting\n\nScripts are also written in javascript and are much more complicated to learn and have lesser educational resources available.  \n\nThe tool to use for this is Microsoft Visual Studio, its free https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\n\nScripting Guide https://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/\n\nThis guys youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@NTProductions\n\n\n##General Good Advise\n\n**Never update in the middle of a project.**\n\nLatest versions of AE always have bugs to work out; wait a few months before updating to latest version. \n\nDo not be afraid to try an effect, it will not ruin the source footage (unless you save a render to the original file(thus over writing it); so do not do that).\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for AE, there is so, so, so much more. Everything covered here can be searched for; tuts and more info is available in the sub's side bar. Practice your Google Foo often.\n\n While there are plugins and scripts to do many tasks it is important to learn how to do things natively in AE; otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure when a problem comes up that a plugin cannot handle.\n\n##ADDITIONALLY:\n\nLearn other software to support your AE projects such as:\n\n**Animate** or other animation software.\n\n**Illustrator** or other vector graphics software.\n\n**Photoshop** or other raster image editng software.\n\n**Premiere** or other editing software(NLE's).\n\n**Learn 3d software like blender, Maya, 3ds Max, C4d full version, or even Houdini. While C4D lite is included in AE it is pretty limited.**\n\nAlso learn about audio editing and mastering using a DAW (Digital Audio workstation). For Adobe that is **Audition** but there are many others out there some less complicated and others much more complicated. As example Ableton Live.\n\nAlso, if you are capable and inclined, learn Javascript as that in itself can save days of work by using expressions in places that keyframeing would be next to impossible( JS also opens up possibilities in web page animation and coding). \n\nIf anybody has anything to add please leave a comment.\n\nEdit  added more stuff concerning compositions,  Thanks every one for participating.\n\nEdit 2 Added more stuff concerning hotkeys and resources. The response has been great and those that have contributed here need to be thanked.",
        "human_comment": "Let me be the first to say, whoa.",
        "AI_comment": "The two-step render is primarily about maintaining the highest possible quality.  While you might not notice a difference in most cases, converting from ProRes to MP4 in Media Encoder gives you more control over the final output settings, including bitrate and encoding options, which can lead to a cleaner final product.  It's also a good workflow for those who might want to work with the ProRes file in other applications before finally converting it to MP4. \n"

All the tutorials I find use Particle which I'm not very familiar with and also is way too complex of an effect for what I need here. But the thing is I can't wrap my head around the 'perfect loop' concept and was wondering what scripts (other than LoopOut) I can use or what sort of math is needed. I tried animating the perfect natural motion manually, yet because there is no 'end' to the motion inside the precomp (other snowflakes keep appearing into frame), the LoopOut begins from the top abruptly.

That\u2019s why I purchased them at the time. After only 2 years they started dropping connection, the fit is a bit whack and the comfort leaves a little to be desired so I started to see what the best on the market was again.\nThe transparency mode and speak to mute options are.. not as smooth as I\u2019d hoped so was happy to look to another brand.\n\nOnce more the new sony WF-1000xm5 earbuds have come out on top again in terms of sound quality and performance. However, based on my previous experience with Sony, they aren\u2019t a product that I will entertain for a few years now.\n\nI will admit I\u2019m an Apple fanboy with all my products, except headphones being Apple so wanted to look on the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s as they had always come second to Sony.

    "AITA for refusing to adopt another child and possibly divorcing my husband over it? ": {
        "title": "AITA for refusing to adopt another child and possibly divorcing my husband over it? ",
        "content": "\nI, 33F, met my husband during university. A mutual friend of ours set us up, and we hit it off instantly. My husband made it immediately clear that he wanted to foster/adopt children in the future and that if I wasn\u2019t okay with it, I would be gone. For context, my husband was adopted when he was 7 and wanted to do the same for others. I also made it clear that I wanted biological children as well, which he was okay with. We ended up married after two years of dating, and both completed our degrees. We currently have two daughters, Rosie5(bio) and Julia7(adopted). We started fostering when my bio daughter was a newborn and adopted Julia around  year ago. Since then, we stopped fostering and chose to focus on our family. However, I\u2019ve noticed my husband clearly favors Julia over Rosie. He takes her out for bonding time but either leaves my daughter or drops her off somewhere else. He doesn\u2019t tuck Rosie into bed anymore, he doesn\u2019t make an effort to go to her events, and he practically ignores her when she\u2019s at home, unless it\u2019s to do something for him like chores. I\u2019ve brought this up constantly to him and I\u2019m at my breaking point. Rosie and Julia are both smart, beautiful, joyous girls. Rosie is both in ballet and gymnastics, highly advanced for her grade level, but has a hard time making friends. Julia has started cheerleading, makes lots of friends, but she does struggle a bit in school, which my husband uses as an excuse to not pay attention to Rosie. I\u2019m currently three months pregnant with our third child, and my husbands reaction to finding out was \u201cwhen can we start fostering again?\u201d Two weeks ago, my daughter asked me \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t daddy love me anymore\u201d and that was when I knew the problem wouldn\u2019t be fixed unless I made a drastic move. I contacted a divorce lawyer and he said nearly everything would be in my favor. We have a prenuptial agreement that allows us to keep nearly everything separate. The house is in my name, we have two separate bank accounts and one joint account, which would be split, I would not be required to pay alimony, and keep one of our cars. Considering I make a substantial amount more than my husband, (250k a year while he makes around 55k) I would be able to continue our lifestyle while he wouldn\u2019t. It also would like prevent him from adopting more children in the future. The situation is ideal for me, besides paying child support, assuming my husband would even be able to support our kids with 50/50 custody. I have no intention of keeping our daughters from him. After speaking with my lawyer I gave my husband an ultimatum, treat both our children equal or I would be filing for divorce. He was enraged after this, screaming about how I\u2019m a b*tch for trying to ruin his life goals and saying how I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for children who experienced the foster care system. That our daughter (Rosie) was selfish and she needed to understand why Julia needed more attention than she did. My girls ended up waking up from the noise and came downstairs crying. At this point I was both trying to calm my husband down and comfort my girls all at once. Finally, my husband stopped yelling and I could put the girls back to bed. But I have to admit, I\u2019ve started to resent Julia. I know very well it\u2019s not her fault and I don\u2019t let that affect how I treat my girls, but I sometimes find myself laying awake at night wondering how it would be if we just didn\u2019t have her. I always imagine myself with a toddler and our last one on the way, my husband loving all our kids, being so kind the way he used to. Again, I do not blame Julia whatsoever and I\u2019m very ashamed of these thoughts. However I\u2019m afraid if something happens again I\u2019ll snap and I don\u2019t want to shout at my daughters or husband. I have both girls in therapy already (Julia needs it because of her past, and we had Rosie go when started fostering.) Any advice is appreciated, as well as criticism. I\u2019m also willing to answer any questions. So AITA? \n\nAlso- these are fake names for my daughter\u2019s privacy as well as a throwaway account. ",

        "content": "Me and my wife have been discussing for years that we wanted a large family. After we had our first child (a boy) we decided to wait 2 years to have another. It\u2019s now been a little over 6 years and it has been a roller coaster. We have completely different parenting philosophies as she does not believe in spankings or discipline at all for that matter. She thinks our 7 year old for whatever reason is able to rationalize between right and wrong. Our biggest argument occurred last summer when our son threw a rock at woman while we were hiking. We were above them on the trail and it hit her right on the head to wear she was bleeding so heavily EMS had to be called. I was embarrassed and so livid that when we got back to the hotel I snapped pushed him on the ground, stood over him, and gave him a piece of my mind. My wife was not happy and in turn took our son, got a different hotel, and told my mother in law that she was contemplating on leaving me because she fears for the safety of our son.\n\nThat was the only time I ever snapped at our kid and there have been so many other times where I\u2019ve wanted to. When he raised the window on our dog head and nearly decapitated her\u2026I had to back off. When he urinated in our neighbors pool in front of his young daughters\u2026.I had to back off. We\u2019ve done therapy and counseling. Needless to say that till this day nothing has changed. I decided to bring it up in one of our counseling sessions that I was considering getting a vasectomy and she flipped to the point where our entire ride home she was bawling because she felt as if I was giving up on our dream of having a big family. Her argument was that I was thinking about myself and weaponizing my body as a means to enforce my ideals instead of talking to her. However, thats thing. I\u2019ve spent the last several years telling her that what we\u2019re doing with our son is not working. The gentle parenting, therapy, medication is not working so the best thing I can do for myself at this point is not have any more children with the person who will not let me have any input when it comes to disciplining our child. \n\nSo this week I actually got the vasectomy and my wife was unaware from the time I scheduled to the day of the operation and I told her during breakfast. She has threatened to divorce me because she \u201cdoes not want to spend the rest of my life with someone who will go to such lengths to get their way\u201d. Every time we\u2019ve discussed me getting a vasectomy she\u2019s said that \u201cI\u2019m blowing things out of proportion \u201c and that having children were apart of our future. At this point, I don\u2019t even care anymore.\n",

It sounds like you've reached your limit, and the vasectomy is your way of protecting yourself and potentially preventing a similar situation from happening with another child. It's not about \"weaponizing your body,\" it's about taking care of your own mental health and well-being. \n"

She was only five years old and passed away from a rare illness. My husband and I were devastated, and we\u2019ve been trying to heal ever since. Iris was our only child, and we haven\u2019t had any more children since her passing.\n\nMy brother (30M) and his wife (28F) are expecting their first child, a girl, and they recently announced that they plan to name her Iris. When they told me, I was shocked and felt a wave of emotions. I told them I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and that it felt like they were trying to replace my Iris. Iris was our rainbow baby since I suffer with fertility issues. We chose the name because Iris is the greek goddess of rainbows. That might be silly to other people but it means the world to me and my husband.\n\nMy SIL got really upset and said that they\u2019ve always loved the name and that it\u2019s a way to honor my daughter. My brother backed her up, saying that I should be touched by the gesture and that it\u2019s their right to name their child whatever they want.\n\nI understand that they can name their baby anything, but it feels too soon and too painful for me. I asked them to choose another name, but now my family is divided. My parents think I\u2019m being unreasonable and that I should be grateful for the tribute, whilst pretty much everyone else thinks it\u2019s insensitive of my brother and SIL.\n\nI love my brother and his wife and they were our rocks during the loss but they are also aware of how much that name meant to us and how long it took us to figure out a name that summed our baby girl up perfectly, she wasn\u2019t just a rainbow baby, she was our rainbow. She brought the colour back into our life. \n\nI would really like to know how other people would have reacted if they were in a similar situation and also advice on what to do next if you don\u2019t mind.

        "content": "A couple weeks ago me (f27) and my amazing husband (m28) got married. To me, the wedding was absolutely perfect!\n\nBackground: I joined the military fresh out of high school. Did my training and went to my first duty station, where I met my now husband and a friend named Liam (m27). My husband and Liam were in the same branch and I was in a different one, but we all worked together and became best friends. Liam and I are mixed and because we hung out so much, everyone thought we were related. So we just told everyone we were cousins. He did try to sleep with me once when we first met but I told him he looked like my sister and it was gross. I showed him a picture of her and he agreed they looked alike. So we just stayed friends. We confided in each other a lot. From heart breaks, to home drama, to work drama. We used to ride around and cry together listening to Marvin\u2019s Room.\n\nAnyway we all started to transfer. We kept in touch and I even visited them when I was on leave. Everything was  good and I still talked to Liam. Then one day he just blocked me or unfriended me on everything. I was confused because I didn\u2019t do anything. We even talked a couple days before this. I was hurt and confused. I thought we were going to be life long friends. After mourning my friendship with Liam and confiding in my now husband I was hurt. He told me Liam\u2019s new girlfriend (now wife) didn\u2019t want him to talk to other girls. I\u2019m used to acquaintances, and coworkers doing this but not my best friend. So I washed my hands.\n\nIt took another couple years until my husband and I confessed our feeling for each other. We started dating and everything was great. He is still friends with Liam and his wife. So we have went out in a group before and I was pleasant but kept my distance. My husband is aware I\u2019m not fond of them but I would not ever stop them from being friends! I\u2019m have moved on from the hurt but I don\u2019t really want anything to do with them, on my own. If that makes sense. \n\nNow, onto the wedding. The ceremony went perfectly! Even if it didn\u2019t I was too happy to even care. The reception started and everyone was getting drinks and food (Buffett style). The photographers, we had 2, were going around taking pictures of us with everyone. Liam and his wife came over and asked us for a picture. I politely declined but encouraged them to take some with my husband. Liam\u2019s wife was upset and started to argue when my man told her I didn\u2019t have to be in a the picture if I didn\u2019t want to. So I went around to other groups, taking pictures with them. The rest of the night was great but I heard Liam and his wife left early. \n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing from mutual friends that they are telling people that I\u2019m hostile and aggressive? Even our friends have called them out on it because most of them were there when it happened. Now Liam is refusing to hangout with us, even in groups until I apologize. My husband told him I\u2019m not apologizing for anything. I did give them an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way\u201d as a good gesture but it wasn\u2019t enough. I absolutely don\u2019t feel guilty at all but I also don\u2019t want my husband to lose one of his best friends. \n\nI guess I\u2019m asking more for advice than if I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nEdit: Liam \u201capologized\u201d when I started dating my husband. It\u2019s in quotes because it was more along the line of \u201csorry if I hurt you, but I made the right decision\u201d kind of thing. I forgave him but basically told him to fuck off. \nI\u2019m not mad at his wife. Shes not the one who hurt me. She has always been and will always be nothing to me but my husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife. I am always cordial to her but we\u2019re not friends. \n\nEdit #2: The photo thing was NOT a new thing.

        "content": "I shot my shot with a girl, she said no, but happenstance led me to be the one that trained her at our part time job, and I was her partner for a project in a class we shared. We became kinda friendly. I won\u2019t lie and say that my romantic feelings are gone, insofar as that if she asked me out, I\u2019d say yes, but I\u2019m enjoying just being her friend. If we go on til we die without a romantic spark, I\u2019d be happy, because I like her as a person. \n\nHer boyfriend broke up with her in a brutal fashion and I basically made damn sure she was okay. I was around as often as she needed and wanted, gave space when she wanted it, took her out to hang out as friends, listened to her and gave advice when wanted and a hug when needed. Not once have I thought of her romantically, just as my friend suffering a serious betrayal.\n\nI made the mistake of telling my mom and she basically tore a strip off my back saying I was doing all this to get what all boys want. She asked me \u201cif she asked you out, would you date her\u201d and used my yes as proof I\u2019m just waiting in the wings and not being a real friend. I\u2019m overthinking things and I can\u2019t really ask my dad as he\u2019s gone on a trip and to be entirely honest he probably wouldn\u2019t bother answering. ",

        "title": "I got scammed on Aliexpress. I fought the seller and won! Here\u2019s how I did it so hopefully you can win too.",
        "content": "Writing this post in the hopes it helps someone else avoid being scammed and if they do get scammed win a dispute.\n\nI recently ordered 2 Window Air Conditioners from 2 different sellers on Ali Express on June 6th and they were to be delivered by the 14th. Combined it was about $650.00 A couple of days later I got the tracking numbers and added them to the package tracking app I use. They were odd numbers that when I tracked them pulled up a Chinese site. Since Aliexpress is based there I figured ok no big deal, I\u2019ve ordered things from places in China before. Days went by and no movements on the tracking number. Started chatting with the seller. I kept getting delays and excuses. We are checking on it, don\u2019t worry. Sorry there\u2019s an issue with our logistics system and we can\u2019t give you a waybill number right now but don\u2019t worry it\u2019s on the way. The 14th passed and then the excuses changed to we have confirmed with the logistics company it will be delivered the 19th. The 19th came and went. Did you not get it? We are checking. Then it was they\u2019ve confirmed your item was delivered on the 19th, did you not find it?\n\nAround this point I happened to notice that the tracking numbers on the orders on the website had changed. So I tracked those numbers only to find 1 said it was delivered the 11th and the other the 12th. I questioned both sellers asking why they are saying they were delivered the 19th when the tracking numbers show differently. I repeatedly asked them to confirm who was the delivery company and what was the tracking number. They both repeatedly avoided the question giving me canned excuses and responses. I noticed one tracking number said it was 1 of 3 packages, all weighing 50-60 lbs each. I only ordered one AC from each seller so that was suspicious. The other thing was it had a delivery photo from FedEx showing a house that was not mine. The other one didn\u2019t have a delivery photo but said it was left in a Locker/Storage Room which sounds like an apt complex. The other thing I noticed was all it said when I tracked them was it was delivered to Minneapolis, MN. I have an account with FedEx and I can see all packages inbound to my address. Neither tracking number was on there. And if I clicked a tracking number for something I know was mine it DID show me my name and address on the delivery event. So I called FedEx and confirmed with them that no, neither tracking number belonged to packages addressed to me and my address. \n\nI opened disputes with both sellers which of course they rejected. One of them just rejected it saying it was delivered. The other did the same and went as far as uploading a document saying it was a FedEx Proof of Delivery Receipt. I noticed it also was missing the name and address on there even though there was a Delivery Name: and Delivery Address: field on the form. I suspected strongly at this point I had became the victim of a scam. If the seller had pulled that from their FedEx account it would have shown that info. \n\nAs of today I have won one dispute, thankfully the one that didn\u2019t have the delivery photo. The other one Aliexpress is in the final stages but pretty sure I\u2019ll win it too. The seller only objected once to the solution and has never since responded. Here\u2019s what I did that I think helped. \n\n1. When you first file the dispute you have a text field to describe the problem. But that\u2019s the only time it shows up. Make sure you are as detailed as possible. Don\u2019t just put I never received the item. That\u2019s what I basically did as I didn\u2019t know it would be the only time it would appear. \n\n2. Seller will likely dispute then balls back in your court. As soon as it allows you to ask Aliexpress to step in do so. \n\n3. Upload as much photo and video evidence as you can. \n\n4. I confirmed with Aliexpress customer service their dispute team doesn\u2019t read your chat with the seller. I took screenshots of every conversation with the seller and uploaded those as evidence so they could read them. Some people say don\u2019t waste time with the seller if they aren\u2019t being helpful. I can\u2019t prove it but I think keeping on them may have helped. The dispute team was able to see that they were just repeating the same canned responses and ignoring repeated questions like asking them to confirm who was the delivery company and what was the tracking number. \n\n5. Sign up for an account on FedEx or UPS. UPS calls their system UPS MyChoice. But having an account allowed me to show all the tracking numbers that were inbound to me and that these tracking numbers were not mine. I did a screen recording on my IPad where I pulled up Aliexpress and went to the order. I used the cursor to point to the tracking number. I clicked copy and then opened FedEx.com. I logged into my account. Then I pasted the tracking number and showed the detailed tracking. I pointed to where it just said delivery to Minneapolis, MN. I then went to the advanced tracking option on the FedEx website. (You have to be signed in for this.) That shows me the dashboard with inbound shipments. I clicked one and was able to show that if the tracking number belonged to me it would actually show my name and address on the delivery event. The fake tracking number does not because it\u2019s not my package. \n\n6. If the seller uploads any kind of proof of delivery in the dispute and it doesn\u2019t show your name and address on it state that info in a reply to Aliexpress. Those kinds of things are easy to totally fake. It\u2019s also possible it\u2019s from a real item they shipped but it was for another customer and they erased that info to hide that fact. Honestly not sure how they would get ahold of a tracking number delivering to the same city unless they happened to have another order they could use to try to fake it for mine. Also entirely possible they are somehow hacking into something giving them access to FedEx tracking numbers. \n\n7. For the one where the delivery tracking showed the delivery photo I showed that and then pulled up my address in Google Maps and showed our house on street view to show the delivery photo is not my house. \n\n8. Remember how I said you can\u2019t enter more text after opening the dispute? I typed out explanations of what the photos and videos showed proving my case. I took screenshots of that and uploaded them as a photo along with the other photos and videos each time.\n\nHopefully these suggestions help you win your dispute. The more evidence you can upload the better chance of winning I believe. I think the fact that I bombarded Aliexpress with evidence whereas the seller could only say no it was delivered and maybe upload one faked proof of delivery worked in my favor.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is before you order anything on there go to the store and read only the 1 star reviews. Had I done this I would never have ordered from them. Both were LITTERED with 1 star reviews all recent for the exact same issue. Item never delivered, tracking number doesn\u2019t belong to my address per FedEx/UPS, seller refuses to refund. Sadly seems like too many folks on there didn\u2019t win their dispute. \n\nI would also advise only using a credit card to order if you do decide to order from AliExpress. I used my debit card (Which was stupid of me as I know better.) Debit cards have far less protection in disputes than credit cards. \n\nSo hopefully this helps you!\n",

        "AI_comment": "I use the \"Parcel\" app for tracking. It's pretty good at consolidating all my shipments from different places.  I've had similar problems with AliExpress, especially when ordering from new sellers.  It's really frustrating when they just ghost you or give you canned responses.  I'm glad you were able to win your dispute, it gives me some hope! \n"

        "content": "**Mortals! You have drawn the ire of the head mod, and will now face judgement for your crimes!**\n\n*ominous thunder crackling sounds intensify*\n\n**end of classic mod power trip. Beginning of actual mod talk.**\n\nAhem, hello! You may have seen me around or on the side bar, 99% of the people here have probably never seen me post on the subreddit, so before this gets going, a brief introduction. I'm Caek, your head mod (supposedly), and was the poor bastard who happened to be second in command (supposedly) when this place was founded (supposedly) as a branch off of AlternateHistory - not the topic, the forum. That OG founder-mod god king was the one who was meant to be doing the main mod work whilst I did all the work on the glorious back end of things to get things like the flair system and the like together, but alas they went inactive and left the position, ultimately catapulting me to the head mod slot. I don't really see myself as a mod-mod, but more like...the repairman, working behind the scenes to keep the mechanical bits of the subreddit working. \n\nSorta. Reddit going over to new reddit has made my life a living hell with that since old reddit is king, but you get the jist of it. Normally, I just do stuff in the background and take no noticeable actions: I flair posts, I do little adjustments here and there, that sort of thing. Lo and behold, years of peace and prosperity (supposedly) follow. \n\nThe thing is, this is one of those times that needs the head mod to actually step up to the table, because it seems like this little cute baby subreddit has somehow grown into an absolute dumpster fire over the last few days. Due to, uh, *issues* with mod team communication (new reddit has the messenger, old reddit has the discussion tab in the mod panel, lo and behold, a mod team split over the two = left hand literally does not know what the right hand is doing), I actually only found out this place was burning down when I found out about it over on Subreddit Drama. The popcorn doesn't taste as nice when you realize it's your sub that's the drama mine (*supposedly*), but that got the ball rolling, and I've spent some time since then going through what I can, chatting with the rest of the mod team, and getting to grips with what the hell has happened to this house. \n\nYou know those situations that come up so rarely on reddit, where there's a huge problem and some super inactive head mod comes back to sort it out? \n\nYeah, this is going to be one of those times. \n\nAfter taking stock with the mod team, I've tried to assemble something of a plan. \n\nSo let's sit back, call this a fireside, and talk. \n\n**The problems:**\n\nA) **The rules on the side bar are, put bluntly, a mess.** Many of these are left overs from the day when the subreddit was originally founded, which means they were meant for a community looking for a backup place to post and to talk about outages for AlternateHistory, the forum, rather than an actual alternate history community in its own right. Some have changed a bit along the way, but most aren't that different from their original form (which for reference you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/L8YC5jH.png)) when we brought them over from the forum. That's a problem, because...well, the subreddit has grown up into its own thing at this point and needs its own set of rules. This isn't a bulletin board, after all, and what works for AlternateHistory.com isn't guaranteed to work for /r/AlternateHistory. You've got mods with good intentions enforcing old rules that haven't been looked at in ages, and that's a disaster waiting to happen; the biggest surprise about this whole situation is that it didn't happen sooner. \n\nB) **The disunity of the mod staff is, suffice to say, a significant problem.** Considering the size of the subreddit (and the topic material, which let's not mess around here, is like playing with fireworks at a gas station), twelve mods is..not exactly sufficient for the task at hand, and a fair number are inactive. Then add in the communications issues between new and old reddit, and you get a situation where the subreddit effectively has multiple teams of moderators - you've got a team on new reddit and a team on old reddit, neither of which is talking to the other, with the possibility of seperate interpretation of the rules. This is the cause of the problem with posts being removed, approved, then removed again - Mod A thinks its bad and removes it, Mod B thinks its okay and puts it back up, Mod A comes back and removes it again. The moderation machine is running, but the two sides aren't talking to one another, which means that there's no shared approach of how to handle the rules and a situation, which means you get what looks like mixed signals at best or two-faced-moderation at worst. \n\nThis is something we're going to work on; part of the hope here is to bring the discussion of moderator actions into the open - our view of the rules and our understanding of them is not something that should be kept in the dark, leaving posters guessing as to what is or isn't a violation of rule 1 or rule 8, for example. Combined with the (desperately needing an overhaul) rule set on the side, I probably don't even need to explain where the issues are coming from - bad rules open to interpretation being implemented by multiple different interpreters on the same reader base = \"what the actual fuck is going on\" becomes a very real sentiment, and one that I share.\n\n\"But head mod, you dastardly wretch, soon to go under the guillotine of the revolution! You've just listed the problems, not the solution!\"\n\nThat's where C comes in.\n\n**Where C Comes In.**\n\nThere's an awfully fitting quote from Battlestar Galactica that can slot right in here: \n\n> There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.\n\nThat's where problems A and B meet. When the people making the rules for the community, interpreting the rules for actions and then enforcing them on the guilty are the same, then you get the result where the community as a whole becomes the guilty; we're not at that level, but it isn't hard to see how the current road could get us there. That's the problem as far as I can see it, and the solution is multifaceted.\n\nA) **Expand the moderation staff** - we're looking out for people who are active and willing to join the team. You don't necessarily have to throw your hat into the ring - we're looking out for high effort posters and the like, the kind of users that don't just throw the moderator stick around, but also set a good example as to what a \"good\" poster should be like. Part of this effort will also be to unite the moderation team as well, and make sure that all members are back on the same page; call this an official \"we dun fucked up\" notification from the moderation. We'll try and be better on that front...\n\nB) **...and part of being better on that is this: a re-examination of the rules**. Those things are probably the real guilty party here in that they're a list that really needs to be looked through and reexamined; some of them were made with good intentions but implemented in relatively poor ways (Rule 8, which I'll be talking about in a moment), others are vague (rule 1, which requires interpretation of what \"alternate history\" actually is - does that mean double blind what ifs, ASB scenarios, political ones?), to say nothing of the basically hidden /r/alternatehistory wiki which is meant to contain the FAQ. This all needs review. \n\nAnd who gets to help us review it? \n\nWhy, you do. \n\nC) **Say hello to the open forum - the other announcement that went up alongside this one, the first ever Friday Forum**. This place originally branched off of Alternate History, a bulletin board which has a thread on it for discussing moderator actions, the rules, general forum conditions and the like. If that can work for a bulletin board, it can work for a subreddit. This isn't going to be run by polls or anything (that just invites the risk of us getting mobbed by people from other subreddits casting votes without backing them up in discussion), but will provide an open place for everyone to talk about the situations going on in the reddit, about the nature of the rules, so forth and so on. \n\nThe goal of the Friday Forum will be to create an environment where everyone can talk to the moderation team (and debate the rules with each other, too) on an even footing; there's obviously going to be moderation in there (please don't post something illegal), but it should be a place where people can talk to each other on an even footing - if you want to say that a rule is trash, that is the place to say it. It is an open discussion for the subreddit, and the moderation will be watching to see where we can improve, what rules might need to be changed, what content should or should not be allowed, how the rules should be interpreted. At the same time, it allows the mod team to try and explain the logic of their view of the rules, and hopefully, get everyone onto the same page - as much for the mod team as for the userbase, no more divided house, but a unified front that will try and make this place grow beyond its roots and become the best place for alternate history on reddit (supposedly). Try not to shoot each other. \n\n**This post is huge, but tl;dr:** \n\nA) There obviously needs to be some discussion about the rules, and by golly, we're gonna have it. \n\nB) The mod team is going to get its act together and get everyone back into the same boat.\n\nC) Some of the rules need to go, others need to be clarified. The largest candidates for discussion here are Rule 1 and Rule 8, which both have a huge slack of interpretation to figure out; rather than have this take place behind closed doors, we're gonna do it in public in the new Friday Forum megathread, which will happen weekly from now on. I'll continue this topic there. \n\nI'll leave the comments here open, because honestly, they shouldn't be locked even on an announcement like this. If there's something wrong or you have suggestions for the team, go for it...but they're probably better off going into the actual Friday Forum thread - come on over!",

        "title": "Results of the First Friday Megathread - Rule Clarification Concepts + Plans Galore!",
        "content": "So! It has been nearly a full week since the Friday Forum Megathread went up, and there's been plenty of discussion, both here and in the moderator channels (much of which has basically been quoted into the comments already - there's no spooky shadow cabal here), and now that things have settled down (both inside and outside of the thread), it seems time for an update. A lot of stuff was talked about, some issues raised that I and the team had never considered, good points and the like. I've read through the thread again, and this appears to be the list of thoughts:\n\n**A) The most upvoted issue was a request to clarify Rule 6, which in its current form reads like this:**\n> No bad faith posts or comments. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into indulging in political mudslinging is banned.\n\nThe general purpose of that rule is to try and avoid, uh, *intensive* discussion on modern day hot topic issues, especially since it is very easy to craft a scenario that is basically the debate-equivalent of napalm. For the most part, there seems to be an agreement that the rule is necessary to keep the sub healthy, and this view is shared by the moderator team; as a result, Rule 6 will most likely be staying, but in an altered form. Here's some possibilities based on various lines of discussion:\n\n**A1**: No posts for the purpose of bad faith, or with the appearance of looking for a fight/bad faith discussion. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into a fight is banned. This is primarily in regard to asking questions about scenarios and comments, rather than full post scenarios that, by their nature, can lead unavoidably into certain topics that might get heated.\n\nThis is a clarification of what \"bad faith\" actually means - not so much for a discussion, but posting for the sake of throwing down with whoever you want to throw down with. It states the scope of the rule as being something that mainly deals with the smaller stuff, like questions, small scenarios, general what ifs and comments. Large scenarios would be relatively protected under this clarification; alternate history scenarios can end up dealing with some genuinely spooky stuff in their own right (ask our cousins over on /r/tnomod, for example) but that's just a reality of the genre for the most part. Someone writing a scenario where World War III becomes a thing is basically writing about the mass death of millions of people in nuclear war, which is certainly a spicy topic, but a pretty unavoidable part of the scenario. The same goes for something like, say a Children of Men style scenario with mass infertility, or an ISOT, which takes a nation and transplants them to a new location, era or world entirely, to say nothing of much more grounded scenarios involving groups like the KKK and the like, violent uprisings with equally violent attempts to suppress them, so forth and so on - alternate history and other speculative fiction is always one of those things where you need to separate the writer from their work, and this reinterpretation of Rule 6 provides room for that.\n\n**A2**: No posts for the purpose of bad faith, or with the appearance of looking for a fight/bad faith discussion. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into a fight is banned. This is primarily in regard to asking questions about scenarios and comments, rather than full post scenarios that, by their nature, can lead unavoidably into certain topics that might get heated. To avoid the risk of heated discussion, anything political within the last ten years (since 2014) is considered to be off-limits.\n\nThat version is the same as the first, but with an additional clause: to avoid getting too much into current, real world affairs, a hard capw ould be placed to cut recent happenings from the sub - anything political after the year 2014 would be considered off topic, advancing forward with each new year. That'd open the door for a wide variety of political tales (ie, things to do with the Bush or Obama years would be completely fine) without getting into current issues which are usually the biggest source of political discussion; few people find it fun getting into a heated discussion about Al Gore or Dukakis. This is a relatively heavy handed approach, but it is also a very neat one in what is considered to be \"political\": no trawling through people's posts to try and determine what angle they might be coming from, no squinting to see what might be meant, just a clean cut time stamp, before which things are allowed, after which they are not. This is probably the most predictable option for moderation purposes.\n\n**A3**: No bad faith discussions, or discussions which could be interpreted as being in the purpose of bad faith, whether for baiting users into heated discussion or for trolling.\n\nThis is the simplest version of the rule, cutting back to the core of Rule 6, but I also find it to be the most...vague. It removes the political side from consideration - any topic that could be considered to be a bad faith one (ie, if OP posts a what if and then starts to try and throw down with everyone that comes in to explain that, no, Siam could not invent the nuclear bomb in 561 AD and their wank scenario has become a full blown bukkake) depending on the action of people inside the thread. It is, like rule 2, predictable, but I find that it could result in discussions that were promising but which unfortunately head to the gutter to end up being deemed bad faith, even if the core idea has merit.\n\nAnd of course, there's **A4: Your suggestion here, on this blank sheet of paper.** There's still room for discussion on this.\n\n**B) Rule 8 was a rule that I myself was iffy on, but seems to be deemed to be more or less acceptable in its current form; generally discussion seems to show that it needs tweaks, not replacement.** Here's the rule in its current form:\n\n> No \"What If\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What If\" questions (What Would, How Would, etc included), shitposts, and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Two violations will result in a permanent ban. Note that this applies specifically to questions, which are more suited to other subs - well-built scenarios that simply use \"What If\" in the title are allowed.\n\nWith the core of the rule being okay, let's look at the edges: the general problem that people mention (that What if scenarios are the bedrock of the genre) is entirely true, but there's also the understanding that it does protect against low quality posting, which used to be a significant issue on the subreddit in the past...but what is a shitpost is a very, very good question. Here's a set of possible alternate versions of the rule:\n\n**B1**: No non-scenario \"What if\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What if\" questions (What Would, How Would, etc included), shitposts, and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban.\n\nThis is basically maintaining the rule in its current form, but streamlining it for clarity - it's function remains the same, but it makes it clear that scenarios that use What If in their title and the like are allowed. It doesn't really change too much, however, so in comes...\n\n**B2**: No non-scenario \"What if\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What if\" questions (posts that ask a question without much input from the original poster: please put a paragraph or preferably more of your own thoughts), shitposts (low effort scenarios meant more for memetic value than for actual discussion), and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban.\n\n...another version of the rule, which does clarify the nature of Rule 8 - it is meant to ward off questions or posts that not that much thought went into, the kind of spur of the moment sort of posts that people come up with as a single thought and put out onto the sub rather than actual scenarios they've sat down and considered for a while. It basically expects you to at least seed the discussion with some content to get it going, show that you've got an actual interest in the answers coming in, so forth and so on. This is more like how I'd expect the rule to function (blank posting goes out the door, but meatier what ifs are allowed to remain unharmed and are welcomed back into the general discussion habit of the sub), working less like an executioner and more like a doorman.\n\nAgain, **B3 - your suggestion here**.\n\n**C) Future History - does it count as alternate history? Generally speaking, this one is still up in the air, but we're starting to get somewhere on this one**: future history scenarios are allowed over on the mothership of AlternateHistory, and they've always been a part of this subreddit from the absolute beginning. Speaking for myself, I'm up for allowing them to remain - if there's no further discussion on this topic, the rules will be amended to make it clear that future history scenarios are allowed, but they might be confined to a certain day of the week to allow for the rest to handle the more bread and butter topics of the genre. Again, active discussion here.\n\n**D) Issues with the Moderation Team - This was a big one that came up in multiple posts, and it has been settled**: having taken detailed stock of the events that transpired over the last two weeks with the rest of the moderation team (helpfully summarized by Samurai [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateHistory/comments/1dfww15/the_first_friday_forum_megathread/l8n5rxi/)), the matter was put to an internal vote amongst the moderation team; TheRtHonLaqueesha no longer commanded the respect or support of the rest of the moderation team, their judgements were deemed to be in error, and so they had to go. As I was the only one with the power as the most senior mod (ominous thunder crackling intensifies), I carried out their wishes and those of the majority of posters; they have been removed from the mod team, and they will not be coming back. We are still actively shopping for additional moderators, and have a number of promising candidates waiting in the wings - we're especially looking out for people in varied time zones, ensuring that there's always a mod online to make sure that things are running nicely and thus always able to settle down any issues before they might get out of hand; if people start fighting in the comments, it helps to get someone in to tell them to chill out at the start of things rather than a few hours later after they've both started throwing death threats or something. We'll have more about this in a future day of discussion.\n\n**E) Mapchat and you, or the minimum quality of images posted to the sub - this one's a bit of a recurring mention in the chat, especially over the last few hours.** MapChart isn't the prettiest mapping tool around, but for many it might be the only tool that you have; this comes under Rule 4, right here:\n\n> Low-effort submissions will be removed by the mods. The content considered low-effort includes maps made solely in \u201cmap-painting\u201d programs like MapChart, simple Google service edits (like Maps or Earth) without a fairly detailed scenario, and AI generated content. Also, low-quality submissions (i.e. those w/ high pixelation or compression) are liable to be removed. Don't post GIFs of still images. Usage of Imgur or the native Reddit client for image uploads is preferred.\n\nThis is, if there's no complaints, going to be amended to read like this:\n\n> Low-effort submissions will be removed by the mods. The content considered low-effort includes maps made solely in \u201cmap-painting\u201d programs like MapChart and simple Google service edits (like Maps or Earth) without a fairly detailed scenario, and AI generated content. Also, low-quality submissions (i.e. those w/ high pixelation or compression) are liable to be removed. Don't post GIFs of still images. Usage of Imgur or the native Reddit client for image uploads is preferred.\n\nIt's a small change, but the middle clause has been adjusted - if your MapChart image has an accompanying scenario to go with it, then it will be allowed. Not everyone has access to a desktop computer to allow them to use better tools than that, or might be posting from mobile whilst away from a desk with a fully written out scenario, but no software to map with. Those kind of situations make me feel that it'd be unfair for their posts to be removed on the grounds of just not using the right software to map with - as long as you're not trying to depict the intricate details of your fifteen sided Swiss civil war through the wonders of burnt toast, then you should be allowed some leniency for the mapping software you use. The other rules about images from games and the like still stands, though. Come on, I know that if you're playing HoI4 that you can probably load paint up or something with a WorldA template map.\n\nSpeaking of WorldA and other template maps, there might be a resources tab coming to the side bar sometime soon, containing various templates and the like for maps, so forth and so on. If this is accepted by the mappers over on AlternateHistory (who often create these base maps), then they'll be a readily available source of resources for making maps of your own for your scenarios.\n\n**F) ASB Scenarios - ah, one of the most used flairs in concept but not in actuality, ASB means Alien Space Bats, generally referring to the \"impossible\" scenarios that require magic** (like So Dies the Fire), very unusual points of departure (ie, the World War series with an alien invasion in the midst of WW2), geographic what ifs (ie, the presence of extra continents and things like that) and other stories that are generally not the result of random chance or human action. Booth slipping with the gun and popping Mary Lincoln in the back of the head is not ASB, but her spitting out the bullet to reveal she's actually a vampire or something would be. ASB posts should be tagged with the corresponding flair (please don't take this as a cue to say that any scenario you disagree with is ASB - it depends primarily whether it depends on those above traits), but will be available. If Australia suddenly appears in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in 1500 AD, then that's an ASB scenario (actually called an ISOT but those are ASB, so it is what it is). These scenarios are allowed, and will be removed from the wording of Rule 1, which is currently this...\n\n> Work must be alternate history. All works must be partially or entirely fictional with a basis in real-world history. However, fantasy and other paranormal or magical content is prohibited.\n\n...but will become something like this.\n\n> Work must be alternate history. All works must be partially or entirely fictional with a basis in real-world history. However, fantasy and other paranormal or magical content is prohibited, except when part of a properly labelled ASB scenario.\n\nDepending on the popularity of this, they too might have the same rule as Future History, and be potentially set up for post on a specific day of the week; more discussion is necessary to get a feel in the sub for whether or not this is a change that you want, or if ASB scenarios should be part of regular posting. Note that this still means that they should be part of history - as in, you can't use the ASB flair to post your original fictional fantasy setting. It's historical with a spin.\n\nI think that covers just about everything, but if not, **post here and we'll see what else needs to be added to the list** - call these the topics for the upcoming Friday Forum if the above isn't a satisfactory set of answers to solve a matter, bricks in the road to a better /r/AlternateHistory. I'll be setting the system up for automatic megathread posting soon (assuming another mod doesn't beat me to it), I'm just a busy bee trying to rest my arm before carpal tunnel permanently ends my professional wall-of-text career before it begins.",

It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different outlet.\n\n* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a variety of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.\n\n* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the RAM is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.\n\n* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS \u2014 this can normally be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Many motherboards also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.\n\n* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, allowing you to update the BIOS without needing the CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives larger than 8GB.\n\n* If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, AMD Radeon RX 7000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6-8pin PCIe cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply sufficient power \u2014 some GPUs may have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving adequate power, please consult your GPU and PSU manual for more information on how to correctly power your GPU.\n\n* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.\n\n* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest [AMD chipset and/or graphics drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html), note that some devices, such as laptops, desktops and handhelds, may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the manufacturer of your device.\n\n* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html) or [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)\n\n* If you have installed GPU drivers after using the AMD Cleanup Utility or DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.\n\n* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take.\n\n* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/)\n\n* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG Galaxy, Xbox App, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using.\n\n* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.\n\n* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.\n\n* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.\n\n* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner or Ryzen Master, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.\n\n* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Please remember that just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.\n\n---\n\n[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/) \u2014 Ocbase is the home of OCCT, the most popular all-in-one stability / stress testing / benchmarking / monitoring tool available for PC.\n\n[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.\n\n[AIDA64 Extreme](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer.\n\n[Furmark 2](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/) \u2014 FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores.\n\n[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.\n\n[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers.\n\n[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.\n\n[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) \u2014 SeaTools - Quick diagnostic tool that checks the health of your drive.\n\nFor more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer specialised software to test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive.\n\nSome motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.\n\nA truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves etc...\n\nIf you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.\n\n---\n\n* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculator and make sure the PSU you have can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.\n\n* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html), [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator), [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/), [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/), [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator), [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator), you can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.\n\n* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit)\n\n* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...\n\n---\n\nIf you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please **backup any important files/data** and completely reinstall your operating system using a USB drive.\n\n**Only use official Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO images that come direct from Microsoft.**\n\nThe latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) using the Media Creation Tool.\n\nIt's not recommended to use utilities or programs which modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware and may cause stability and compatibility issues.\n\nIf you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.**\n\n*Below is an example template you could use...*\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the issue**: The Invincible will crash with Adrenalin 24.3.1 if you have Radeon Chill enabled and try to open the in-game overlay , this is not an issue if you revert to Adrenalin 24.2.1.\n\n**What I have tried to resolve the issue**: I have reinstalled 24.3.1 with the AMD Cleanup Utility, reset my in-game graphics settings, verified game files in the Epic Games Store and confirmed the issue is still present if Radeon Chill is enabled.\n\n**System specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Windows 11 23H2, OS Build 22631.3374 (to find OS build version, press the Windows Key + R and type *winver*)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700, cooled by a be quiet!

It makes the annual fee look not so much out of control (which I think it kind of is but still works for me) and everything just gets better if you have a point strategy system in place with other Amex cards.\n\nQuick example:\n\nWith the CS I get over 3.5x points on gas stations since I combine it with the Everyday Preferred (since I usually always get the 50% bonus increase) and over 1.5x points on any uncategorized purchases which is higher than any Amex points card.\n\nOf course this is assuming that you are considering getting a Platinum in the first place, that the annual works with your spending/finances and that you are not redeeming points for travel, gift cards or etc. In my opinion is a no brainer if you can get it since it gives you another exit route for point redemption when you just rather get the cash back for something else.

        "content": "I started this sub 10 months ago in order to create a space to make fun of, criticize (yes that includes shitposts), and generate legitimate discussion regarding r/AmITheAsshole. We criticize their censorship on their sub, and mod decisions we disagree with. That however DOES NOT mean we will censor them or those that agree with their mod team in return (though we fully recognize that they would likely ban a user criticizing them on an AITA post). I stand for free speech in its entirety, and will protect it just as vehemently on this sub for those that disagree with the views of the majority here, as the views of the minority (regardless of their status on this sub or any others).\n\n\nThe reason I'm stating this is because a member of our mod team made a decision that mirrored censorship, and for reasons that I felt were misguided. Yes their action was directed at a moderator on r/AmITheAsshole commenting on here, but their views/comments are welcome here so long as they do not violate sitewide rules. I tend to tread *very* lightly on moderation here. I prefer to allow the system of downvotes and upvotes to allow users to decide which posts/comments the majority agrees should be on top. Yes, that allows shitposts to sometimes consume the feed but it's your choice to decide, not mine, nor anyone else's on the mod team. If a mod from AITA says something stupid on this sub, downvote them and call them out on their bull shit, I encourage it. But neither me nor any member of this moderation team should take any removal, muting, or banning action against them unless they violate the subreddit's rules or sitewide rules. \n\n\nOn top of this I would also like to state that I will *never* allow the moderation team of r/AmITheAsshole to have any real influence or power over this sub. We are completely independent of them, and I will not allow them to censor or silence us in any way. Though they have reached out many times and voiced their opinion on our sub and their disdain for it, asking us to make changes on occasion that would compromise what this sub is, I have never, and will never, give in. \n\n\nOn top of this, I would like to remind everyone that there should be no brigading/trolling on r/AmITheAsshole. So far from what I can tell we've done an AMAZING job so far and have not had ANY complaints from r/AmITheAsshole moderation team (which to me, sounds pretty good). But I also want to remind that it means:\n\n\n**Don't comment or post on an r/AmITheAsshole post that is crossposted here**\n\n\n**Don't post/comment criticisms of their sub/moderation team on their sub, keep it to this one** (if you're subscribed here that is, if you're a passerby that happens to find this you're not my problem lmao)\n\n\nAnd as always... **Follow reddiquette**\n\n\nAnd so long as we do this and keep it up we won't have to worry about anything or any sort of retaliation against this sub. Again though, y'all have done an AMAZING job of behaving and following the rules, and this isn't a warning to any of y'all in any way (this is more geared towards new subscribers). \n\n\n***ALSO I KNOW I'M REALLY REALLY LATE AND I DIDN'T MAKE A POST, BUT HAPPY 10, NOW 11K!!!!***",

In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open.\n\nUnfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history.\n\nI did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either.\n\nThe distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that.\n\nMy cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.

People are not following the rules about what is acceptable to post here, so I thought some clarification was in order.\n\n* **Posts must be about people who can't tell or accept that they have been dumped.**\n\nPlease do not add posts where people are confused about whether they should dump their partner (see r/relationships etc.) or who's the asshole in a conflict (visit r/AITAH etc.), etc. The matter at hand should be crossposts of users asking questions like:\n\n   * \"she had a baby with someone else and told me 18x that it's over, but I'm not sure: is it over?\"\n\n   * \"he hasn't called or texted me in 7 months and married his yoga instructor, have I been dumped?\"\n\n   * \"I've been served divorce papers and she emigrated to Bolivia, how can I get her back?\"\n\n* **Posts must be about romantic partners, not other types of relationships:** no children ditching shitty parents or vice versa (see r/JustNoFamily etc.) or downtrodden employees embittered by an unjust firing from their crapola jobs (visit r/antiwork etc.). \n\n* **Posts must include the post text:** either the automod will catch it and put it in a comment, you copy-and-paste it into the body of your post, or you paste a link into the body and copy-and-paste the text into a comment. Don't make people have to hunt for the content.\n\nPlease note that all the buzzwords mentioned here - \"crosspost\", \"don't realize\", \"can't accept\", \"romantic partner\" are all contained in the sub's description and have been for a while, so you can't say it was ambiguous or unclear.\n\n***Posts that do not follow these rules will be removed.***\n\nAnd a word about comments: quite a few of you are responding to the OP as if they were the writer of the crosspost. I personally don't care if people are commenting as if the OP were the OOP, but just a reminder: the people crossposting here are 99.9% of the time not the OP of the original post. *Your comments are not reaching the OOPs.* If you still want to respond to the OOP, rock on, but you're just shouting into the void.\n\nHope this helps!",

The therapist said something today I really don't agree with, but I want to know if I am in the wrong for feeling this way. \n\nBecause of my partner's mental health issues, he can be very selfish and not consider my needs sometimes. I have been hoping that therapy would help him with that, and understand my point of view better. \n\nAn issue that has been causing the most arguments lately is that he doesn't help me clean. I have to nag him, and sometimes that doesn't even work. We both work full-time. His job is just very physical and busy in the summer, and he sometimes works 14-hour days. This is just in the summer; he doesn't work much in the winter. \n\nI work from home, but I am also a full time college student. I still make time with the little time I have to clean the house. \n\nWhen I ask him to help, I only ask for small things to help me out. I will clean the entire house and only ask that he wash the dishes in the sink and take the trash out. I don't demand these get done the second I ask about it or even the day I ask about it. Once five days have passed, and the trash is still sitting there, I get angry. \n\nI brought this up in therapy today and mentioned that it also bugs me because I go out of my way to do things for him, but he doesn't consider me. \n\nHe knows I have trauma from growing up in a hoarder house, and he doesn't care to think about me. \n\nThe therapist said that my \"need\" for the house to be clean is my problem because of my trauma and that I need to compromise with my partner. He said that my partner doesn't choose to work, but I chose to take these summer classes, so my stress is my own fault. \n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way because I don't feel I am asking for a lot. \n\nI get that taking summer classes was my choice, but I graduate in December, and I can help our family financially when I get this degree. The therapist said I need to compromise, but what about my partner? How is it unfair for me to ask for help? Why do I need to compromise when I have been sobbing to my partner, telling him I feel like I'm drowning?\n\nI really want to improve the relationship, and I know that I am not a perfect partner. There are things I do that are wrong, but I don't feel like I am wrong in this situation.  \n\nI liked the therapist up until this point, but now I feel a little nervous. I also wanted to know if I mistook what he said. ",

It's not your trauma that's the problem, it's your partner's lack of empathy and willingness to contribute to the household. You're not asking for much, and you deserve to be heard and respected. You might want to consider finding a new therapist who can truly help you navigate these complex issues in a healthy way. \n"

Me, my partner and this friend went out for drinks around 2 months ago. The friend was quite shy and socially awkward.\n\nShe thanked me for being nice to her and understanding she wasn't extroverted etc and takes a while to be comfortable around people. I told her not to worry and that I'm not going to judge her for being shy when I used to be really shy when I wsa younger. As the night went on things were going well until one point when my gf went to the toilet at one of the bars.\n\nThe friend got closer to me and tried to kiss me. I backed off before she managed to get close enough and told my gf straight away. Me and my gf left the bar and went home. For a couple of weeks they didn't speak but my gf decided to hear her out and went to meet up with her.\n\nThey talked things through and this friend apologised to my gf and told her to apologise to me aswell. My gf said they're working on mending their friendship and have been meeting up again.\n\n A couple of weeks ago my girlfriend said she was thinking of the three of us going for drinks again but I refused. I said I think it's odd she's still friends with her but I can't control her friend but what I can control is who I'm around and I don't want to be around her. \n\nMy girlfriend said I was overreacting and the friend is sorry. Last week my gf mentioned doing a movie night with this friend and asked if I would be home. I told her I was and that I don't want the friend in the apartment.\n\n My gf said I could always go out for the evening but I refused and just said if she wants a movie night she can go to her friends because I don't want her friend in our apartment. My gf said I was overreacting again and should be fine with her friends coming round but I refused to change my mind.\n\nAIW for refusing to let my girlfriend friend in the apartment?",

At first, I tried to keep an open mind, but soon I noticed he was controlling and manipulative. He isolated her from her friends, belittled her, and it seemed like he was only interested in her for our money. I was worried sick.\n\nDespite my concerns, she stayed with him. Every time I tried to talk to her, she defended him, saying I didn\u2019t understand. I felt desperate and frustrated. In a moment of anger and fear for her future, I gave her an ultimatum: leave him, or I\u2019d cut her off financially.\n\nShe chose him. Heartbroken and frustrated, I stuck to my word and disowned her. I stopped all financial support and cut off contact, hoping she would see the truth about him and come back. But she moved in with him, and they struggled. I heard through mutual friends that he was treating her poorly, which tore me apart. I blamed myself, thinking if I had been more present, she wouldn\u2019t have ended up with someone like him.\n\nher mother passed away when she was just seven years old.

        "content": "We decided to do this again but push it back so a single year could be done. zzpza did the work of acquiring the data to be used. Malamodon did all the analysis work, therefore all data is subject to their biases. They have done a lot work on the previous ones, and the comparison between each year's graphs show no massive swings that would indicate a sudden change in biases, so should be considered accurate enough for this project.\n\n---\n**Method**\n\nAll the posts to /r/Analog for the time period (January 2022 to December 2022) were imported into a database. Deleted and removed posts were excluded. 1300 random posts were selected using the SQL rand() feature and saved to a tab in a Google spreadsheet. A second export from the database was then done, ordered by post score; the top 1300 were saved to a different tab in the same spreadsheet. 1300 was used as further manual sorting obviously removes more posts so you'd come up short with only 1000 in the starting set. Any excess entries left over after the final data set was done were discarded.\n\nEverything after this was then manually processed. Types of posts removed: any remaining deleted/removed posts, all non-photo posts including videos, and gallery/album posts. Any posts in Random that were present in Top were removed from Random.\n\nThat done, we had a useable data set for Top 1000 and Random 1000. [This document is available to anyone to view or copy to their own google drive and do their own analysis.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW6t8cG4D1IiVn1uS2BrjxE8EU1oYEL2YGRhFYPSLao/edit#gid=591709958)\n\nThe categories were kept the same as previous years for consistency. This isn't comprehensive but we felt the ones chosen accounted for the major genres of photography, anything that did not fit neatly into one or two of these categories was categorised as 'Other'. Each photo was then manually assessed and categorised. This process is obviously subjective and imperfect, but we believe we have stuck to our definitions. We hit an issue of not being able to always neatly slot a photo into just one category so we allowed for a secondary category to be flagged when it was felt a post was split in subject equally or in the 60/40, 70/30 range. Anything marked 'Other' or with a secondary flag was reassessed after the initial categorisation pass.\n\nAdditional attributes were also catalogued: -\n\n* Black and white or colour film  \n* Film used  \n* Camera used  \n* Is the post NSFW  \n* Multi exposure (2 or more exposures on the same frame)  \n* Film rebate present (having the film borders around the image)  \n\nThe 'Film Used' column was consolidated for certain stocks, so Portra 160, 400, 800, NC, VC, etc. is all just Portra, same thing for Superia, Cinestill, Lomo CN, etc. Only the top 10 was chosen in the charts due to the large number, even with the consolidation. There was demand for a breakdown of Portra stocks since it accounts for such a large portion, so that was done.\n\n---\n**Results**\n\nWhat is data without charts. So here they are:\n\n* [Photo Subject - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/V7AzET8.png)\n* [Top 10 Films Used - Top 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/sejm1TZ.png)  \n* [Top 10 Films Used - Random 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/esgf0jE.png)  \n* [Colour or Black & White - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/dgbOQs0.png)\n* [Breakdown of Kodak Portra - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/MTNBNUb.png)\n* [Breakdown of film formats used](https://i.imgur.com/f0khSdP.png)\n* [Breakdown of camera manufacturers](https://i.imgur.com/NUq1aEa.png)\n* [Camera models with 10 or more posts](https://i.imgur.com/srkNQ23.png)\n\n* [Album Version](https://imgur.com/a/uHvhFN2)\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nSince there is now three sets of data, some charts comparing the three years were also done.  \n\n* [Here's an album of those charts.](https://imgur.com/a/kO1sZZH)\n\n---\n**Opinions**\n\nThe results aren't massively different from the previous year, so previous opinions still hold up.\n\n* The disparity remains between male and female subjects in the top versus random. Landscape edges ahead as the most popular category, with animals/nature rocketing up from last year to second.\n\n* NSFW has seen an increase in Top from 1-2% to 7%. It should be noted that 5 users account for about 40% of those posts.\n\n* Kodak Gold and Cinestill films increase in popularity, with a decline in Superia. Black and White films getting a bit more popular in Top as well; maybe more people are shooting B&W now due to the rising costs of colour film.\n\n* A small tussle between medium format and 35mm goes back to 2020 levels. Could be the same reason as with colour film, medium format is more expensive per shot, and cameras for it continue to increase in price.\n\n* In Top, Pentax sees a 7% decrease, Hasselblad a marginal decline, Nikon seeing a nearly 5% increase in popularity.\n\n---\nThink we suck at this? Want to do your own analysis or something else?

        "title": "Bootleg Megathread, June 26, 2024",
        "content": "Hello /r/AnimeFigures, and welcome again to the Bootleg Megathread! \n\nPlease use this thread to post any and all questions you might have regarding counterfeit figures. **This includes questions such as \u201cIs my figure a bootleg?\u201d and \u201cCan I trust this seller?\u201d.**\n\nRemember to be as detailed as possible when asking for help. Provide clear pictures (ideally, multiple) or a link to the item you\u2019re looking to buy, depending on what you\u2019re asking. Let us know why you think this might be a bootleg, or why you don\u2019t trust this seller. Also keep in mind that different types of figures vary in quality. For example, a prize figure won't have the same level of detail or quality as a scaled figure.\n\nAs bootlegs are a serious problem for anyone who enjoys collecting, we are also happy to provide you with a few tips to spotting them yourselves. We encourage you guys to practice these tips before posting here. \n\n###For figures you already have:\n\n* Examine your retailer. Are they known to sell counterfeits? Keep in mind that all retailers on the sidebar are approved by /r/AnimeFigures, and do not sell bootlegs.\n\n* Was the price far lower then the current average?\n\n* Check MFC for known counterfeits. If a figure has any there will be [red text indicating so]( http://i.imgur.com/Pp0Dxqy.png) on that figure\u2019s listing. Click on the red text to see pictures of the bootleg. \n\n* Compare yours to the counterfeit and the **user pictures**- Do not compare yours to the prototype. (Comparison tip: Start with the hair. I usually find that the be the easiest place to spot differences!)\n\n* Look for poor quality paint jobs, materials, or sculpt work (lots of \"coloring outside the lines\", shiny skin, missing textures or gradients, ect).\n\n* Examine the box. Some bootleg boxes are [very easy to spot](http://myfigurecollection.net/picture/823998&amp;ref=category%3A3+item%3A166924), and some- [not so much](http://myfigurecollection.net/picture/514199&amp;ref=category%3A3+item%3A72522). Look for a [holo sticker](http://i.imgur.com/uzppfPF.jpg?1) of authenticity.\n\nPast Bootleg Megathreads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/search?q=bootleg+megathread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all), **for reference only**. Please be sure to only post in the current one.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n###For figures you're looking to buy:\n\n###General Tips:\n\n* Examine your retailer. Are they known to sell counterfeits? Keep in mind that all retailers on the sidebar are approved by /r/AnimeFigures, and do not sell bootlegs.\n\n* Is the price far lower then the current average?\n\n* Check item descriptions carefully. Bootlegs may be listed under fake brands rather than the known manufacturer. They may also contain descriptions like \"China version\" to avoid admitting that they are fake; similar weasel-word terms include \"hand-made\" (and its often-associated \"item size may vary\") and \"colors may differ on your screen\".\n\n* [Check MFC for a shop review listing.](http://myfigurecollection.net/shop/) \n\n\n###Ebay Checklist:\n\n####1. Price. \n* Again. Seriously, have I mentioned that yet? Insanely low prices should be throwing up some serious alert signals.\n\n####2. Look for pictures of the actual product, *that the seller took*.\n* A lot of sellers like to list their items with the official photos put out by the manufacturer. Check MFC if you're unsure of what you\u2019re looking at. If the pictures under \"official\" on MFC are the same as the ones on eBay, then they were not taken by the seller. Some sellers are just lazy and don't want to take pictures for every listing, but some use that as a trick to make you think you're getting an official item, when you're really going to get a bootleg. \n* When in doubt, ask the seller for pictures of the actual product. If they ignore you, or say they can't do that, move on to a different listing.\n\n####3. Check their feedback. \n* Look specifically for feedback where the buyer received a bootleg. This is usually going to be in the \"negative feedback\" section.\n\n####4. Check where it ships from. \n* eBay is really good about letting you know where an item is shipping from. If it ships from China, that's a bad sign.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n#Frequently Asked Bootleg Questions:\n####1. Is AliExpress a good website to buy from?\n* No, stay away from AliExpress. As far as figures are concerned, they *only* sell bootlegs.\n\n####2. How about Wish? And Mercari?\n* Wish appears to be nearly as bad as AliExpress in terms of bootleg frequency. User reports from Mercari depict a wide range of scenarios, with good sellers mixed in with people egregiously marking up their merchandise and more than a few bootlegs. Use with caution.\n\n####3. Is Amazon.com a good source for figures?\n* The increased use of the practice of [commingling inventory](https://blog.redpoints.com/en/amazon-commingled-inventory-management) has led to [an increase in the amount of counterfeit merchandise appearing on Amazon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/14/how-amazons-quest-more-cheaper-products-has-resulted-flea-market-fakes/). This increases the possibility of receiving a bootleg from them even if the seller appears to be otherwise trustworthy (even for \"shipped and sold by Amazon.com\"), and should be considered a reason to avoid them if possible. If one does choose to buy figures on Amazon, particularly with third-party sellers, apply the same criteria for price, seller photos, and deceptive descriptions as one would for a seller anywhere else, though the commingling issue will remain unless the item's path to the buyer is specified.  \nAmazon listings may copy images and descriptive text from other sites. Be particularly careful to check that the company in the \"Brand\" line matches the item's official producer, and watch for questionable text as mentioned above.\n\n####4. My Nintendo nendoroid/Figma has a white, square sticker, rather then the shiny oval one that can be found in the official pictures on MFC. Does that mean I have a bootleg?\n* No, the square sticker is also legitimate.\n\n###A Related Topic:\n\n* People often ask about the legitimacy and/or safety of a number of websites which sell large resin statues. The more commonly-asked of those deal primarily in resins from studios which do not have a license from the Japanese IP holders to produce merchandise. Therefore links to those sites are not permitted here. Another indicator is if [MyFigureCollection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) doesn't list the either the statue, its manufacturer, or the shop it's being sold on. While MFC does not list every legitimate item for various reasons, it does reject unlicensed ones.\n    __________________________\n\nPast Bootleg Megathreads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/search?q=bootleg+megathread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all), **for reference only**.

What\u2019s the best place to buy my anime figures from?**\n\nThat\u2019s going to depend a lot on what works for you, but most people around here buy them from Amiami, Big in Japan, Hobby Search, HobbyLink Japan, or Tokyo Otaku Mode. If none of those work for you for whatever reason, there\u2019s [a list of reputable retailers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/wiki/shops) in the sidebar that you can check out at any time. Be extra careful when ordering figures from websites like Amazon or ebay, as there are a lot of bootlegs on those sites. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask in our Bootleg Megathread if you\u2019re unsure.\n\n**2. What differences are there between the shipping options I get from most Japanese shops?**\n\nBelow is a rundown of the main shipping choices you\u2019ll get at most retailers. Keep in mind that if an order is large enough you will be forced to use one of the more expensive options, as SAL shipments have lower size and weight restrictions.\n\n* **Unregistered SAL:** Sometimes referred to as uSAL, is usually the cheapest method. It does not come with any tracking or insurance. Usually takes up 2-4 weeks for delivery.\n* **Registered SAL:** Sometimes referred to as rSAL, is insured for the declared value up to 6,000 yen. It comes with a tracking number and usually takes 2-4 weeks for delivery.\n* **EMS:** This method of shipping is much faster than either SAL options, usually arriving within a week of shipment. EMS shipments are insured for the declared value up to 2,000,000 yen.\n* **Airmail**\n* **E-packet**\n* **Surface:** Shops don't offer this very often. It's an actual cargo ship and slow as a result.\n\n* **DHL:** Becoming more available as an alternative to EMS on AmiAmi and other sites. Can be less expensive than EMS and of comparable speed, but may be more reliant on the specific geographical area being shipped to. The price is also determined by the size of the box. Offers their own tracking.\n\n**3. I placed two+ orders for figures at different times. Will my items be shipped together, or will I have to pay shipping twice?**\n\nMost shops will ask you to pay shipping on a per-order basis, but here are some that will allow combined shipping:\n\n* **Amiami:** You can combine orders here, as long as the orders ship in the same month. It doesn\u2019t matter if the item is new or preowned. Any preorders that are set for that month can also be combined with other orders for that month. However, be aware that if the preorder gets delayed, Amiami will remove that item from that month\u2019s shipment and place it on a new order. To combine orders on Amiami, use the \u201cCombine Orders\u201d feature under \u201cMy Account\u201d.\n\n* **Hobby Search:** Hobby Search will let you combine orders that release in the same month, but you cannot combine in stock items with preorders. If you want to combine multiple preorders, or multiple in stock items, you can do so using the \u201cOrder Recombination\u201d feature on your account page.\n\n* **HobbyLink Japan:** At HLJ, you have the option to send paid orders to their \u201cPrivate Warehouse\u201d, where you can store them for up to 2 months. When you\u2019re ready to ship the items, you simply select which items to ship and HLJ will combine them into one shipment for you. To use this, just select the \u201cPrivate Warehouse\u201d option as shipping when you order.\n\n*If you\u2019re unsure about whether or not a shop we haven\u2019t listed will combine your orders, please refer to their individual FAQs.*\n\n**4. When will I get charged for my preorder?**\n\nMost Japanese shops charge you once the item is in stock and ready for shipment. When that happens, they will send you an email asking for payment. Some shops (mostly overseas ones), will allow you to pay for the item up front though, if you\u2019d like. A few with that option are:\n\n* Big in Japan (Japanese store)\n* Tokyo Otaku Mode\n* Anime Island\n* Crunchyroll\n\nKeep in mind that overseas stores will likely get the figure a few months after Japanese ones, so pay attention to the release date stated on the website you are buying from so as to avoid that confusion.\n\n**5. Should I expect to pay customs fees when importing figures?**\n\nThat depends on where you live. Here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n* **Australia:** 10% GST is now assessed up front.\n* **Canada:** Minimum declared value for charges is around CAD$20 for regular shipments, and CAD$60 for gifts (gifting something only seems to lower the declared value by about CAD$40, not deplete it completely). When using Amiami, try their Small Air Packet option. It comes with tracking, gets there in about the same time as EMS, and is better at avoiding customs.\n* **European Union:** As of 1st July 2021, VAT has to be paid on all goods imported from outside of the EU. Retailers are supposed charge VAT for purchases under \u20ac150, however many Japanese retailers currently do not, so VAT will be charged when your order arrives in the EU. Orders that are >\u20ac150, VAT and duty will be charged by your local customs.\n* **UK:** As of 1st January 2021, VAT is to be charged by retailers for orders <\u00a3135. However, customs isn't currently charging VAT on parcels valued at <\u00a3135, even if the VAT hasn't been paid. Goods >\u00a3135 will have their VAT and duty calculated and charged by customs.\n* **Mexico:** Minimum declared value for customs fees is USD$300 for shipments by post, and USD$50 for shipments by courier.\n* **United States:** A shipment has to have a declared value of USD$2,000 before customs starts hitting you with fees, so you most likely won\u2019t have to worry about them at all.\n\n**6. The figure I want is an exclusive, how do I go about ordering one outside of Japan?** \n\nYou have three options for this:\n\n**A.** [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/) is known to stock exclusive figures and ship to other countries. Usually the price is higher because they build in their proxy fees, but it\u2019s easier than worrying about using a forwarder or proxy service. If you live in the US, [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/store), [Right Stuf](http://www.rightstufanime.com/), and [Tokyo Otaku Mode](http://otakumode.com/) also get exclusives sometimes, but out of the states the shipping can get expensive.\n\n**B.** Forwarding Services: A forwarder is someone who you ship an exclusive item to so that they can forward the package on to you, usually for a flat fee + shipping. When using a forwarder you still make the purchase yourself, and enter their address into the shipping field. When the box arrives at the forwarder they will then stick your address onto the package and send it on its way.\n\nSome popular forwarders are:\n\n* [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/en/content/16-forwarding-terms)\n* [Tenso](http://www.tenso.com/en/)\n\n*Be sure to read each sites instructions on forwarding carefully!*\n\n**C.** Proxy Services: With a proxy, you tell them what the item you\u2019re looking for is and they will purchase it in your stead. This is handy for when a company doesn\u2019t accept foreign credit cards, or you\u2019re having trouble navigating a Japanese website.\n\nSome popular proxies are:\n\n* [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/content/14-proxy) (Won\u2019t proxy for Yahoo Auctions)\n* [From Japan](http://www.fromjapan.co.jp/)    \n\n*Again, be sure you thoroughly read through each sites proxy instructions.*\n\n**7. I see a bunch of really cheap figures that ship from China on ebay. Are those okay to buy?**\n\nGenerally, no. They\u2019re most likely bootlegs. If you want a second opinion on that, feel free to ask in the Bootleg Megathread that\u2019s always stickied at the top of the sub.\n\n**8. What\u2019s a bootleg, and how can I avoid buying them?**\n\nA bootleg is a counterfeit figure often made using rejected molds of the official product. They are usually priced significantly lower than the genuine article, and in order to make their profit, bootleggers use lower quality materials and have less attention to detail- resulting in a substandard figure.\n\nThe Bootleg Megathread that I mentioned in question 7 is a great tool to avoid buying any bootlegs. It has a few tips and tricks to avoiding them to begin with, and a few more on how to spot them if you\u2019re worried you might already own one.\n\n**9. Does anyone know when figure X is going to be released? How do I know if it was delayed?**\n\n[My Figure Collection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) (sometimes referred to as MFC) does an excellent job of staying on top of information like release dates and delays. If you\u2019re curious about an upcoming figures release date, check there first. This information can be found [directly under the \u201cReleases\u201d section](http://i.imgur.com/8tOOdc2.png) on a figure\u2019s entry. If you only see a month and a year in that section, it means the release date has not yet been announced by the manufacturer, and there is still a chance the figure could be delayed.\n\nIf you make an account on MFC you can also subscribe to comments, changes, and pictures via a checkbox on the right hand side of a figure\u2019s listing. Subscribing to any of these things will allow MFC to send you an email anytime the subscription in question updates. Subscribing to \u201cchanges\u201d is a great way to keep up with release dates and delays, among other things.\n\n**10. The figure I want is long sold out at normal retailers! What\u2019s the best place to pick it up in the aftermarket?**\n\n[A list of reputable retailers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/wiki/shops) can be found under the \u201cShops\u201d section of the /r/AnimeFigures sidebar. They all sell legitimate products, and many of them also sell figures second hand. However, the most frequently suggested second hand sites are [Mandarake](http://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/) and [Amiami](http://amiami.com/)- who has [a preowned section](http://slist.amiami.com/top/search/list3?s_condition_flg=1&s_sortkey=preowned&pagemax=70&inctxt2=31) that they update every night save Sundays and Japanese holidays around 1PM JST and again around 6PM JST.\n\nAmiAmi grades their pre-owned items on a letter scale. The general consensus from buyers is that their ratings are conservative, so unless the item and/or packaging is specifically indicated as having significant flaws, pre-owned items from them are usually in at least as good a condition as their rating suggests.\n\n**Note:** *When you search Mandarake, you\u2019ll get the best results by using the Japanese characters for whatever you are searching. If you don\u2019t know them, you can find them on MFC by [clicking on any of the \u201cdetails\u201d in that figure\u2019s listing](http://i.imgur.com/rm5JcV5.png).*\n\n**11. Amiami has a figure I\u2019m interested in labeled as \u201cFor sale in Japan only\u201d. Does this mean I can\u2019t order it without a proxy or forwarder?**\n\nNo, you can still order it. Amiami\u2019s English site has that warning on many items, and it\u2019s mostly meant to inform you that this product was made for a Japanese market, and as such, will have Japanese speaking/writing in it- so don\u2019t expect any instructions to be in English. If Amiami doesn\u2019t want foreigners buying a certain product, they won\u2019t even list it on their English site.\n\n________________\n\n###Displaying Your Figures\n\n**12. What display cases do you recommend?**\n\nIf you live near an Ikea try out one of these:\n\n* [Klingsbo](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60128562/)\n* [Billy](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40279788/) (Often used with [Morliden doors](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30279755/) (now the [H\u00d6GBO](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hoegbo-glass-door-white-20517243/) and glass shelves.)\n* [Detolf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10119206/): Formerly the go-to choice for inexpensive display cabinetry, the Detolf was first made flimsier around 2020 and then essentially phased out of the name, to become the [BL\u00c5LIDEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/blaliden-glass-door-cabinet-black-00520519/). Knockoff versions of widely-varying quality are commonly found on other shopping sites these days, though.\n\n*If you decided on a Detolf, you might find that there is a lot of wasted space. Here are a few tutorials on raising the shelves or and adding extra ones in.\n\n* [Using metal clips](http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/tutorials-and-how-tos/423114-ikea-detolf-modification-adding-additional-shelves.html)\n* [Using acrylic supports and PVC pipe](http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1279)\n\nIf you don\u2019t live near an Ikea, [Amazon has a few display options](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_sc_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acurio+cabinet&keywords=curio+cabinet&ie=UTF8&qid=1434637271), though they are more expensive. Also keep an eye on your local Craigslist (or your country\u2019s equivalent) and stores near you that are closing up.\n\n**13. What lighting do you guys recommend?**\n\nIkea\u2019s Dioder LED strips were discontinued after a long run. A current version is the [Vattensten](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vattensten-led-light-strip-multicolor-80530604/), if you're inclined to buy your case and lights at the same time.\n\nLED strips have become very commonly available in recent years; most hardware and home furnishing stores carry a selection now. Just make sure that the lights don\u2019t get too hot!\n\n**14. What are those clear plastic boxes that I see under everyone\u2019s figures in their collection posts, and where can I get them?**\n\nThose are called risers. Most of us use standard acrylic risers like [these](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_sc_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aacrylic+risers&keywords=acrylic+risers&ie=UTF8&qid=1434482857). Some other, easy to find things that have been suggested are:\n\n* [Plastic picture cubes](http://i.imgur.com/ROTBHG8.jpg)\n* [Card Deck Boxes](http://i.imgur.com/qOQllVZ.jpg)\n* If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, [try making your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/3b6oy6/ranimefigures_faq/csjq88n)!\n\nCheck your local hobby store for the first 2 options, or your local hardware store if you want to make your own.\n\nAnother common suggestion is to visit [The Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm) if you have one near you. They have a lot of things to choose from that can suit a variety of needs. Be sure to check out their [standard acrylic risers](http://www.containerstore.com/shop/collections/display?productId=10019504&N=232&breadcrumbPageTitle=Search&mr=baseball+display), their [Amac boxes](http://www.containerstore.com/shop?productId=11000251&N=&Ntt=amac+boxes), and the various display cases they sell (baseball cases, mini car cases. hockey puck cases, etc).\n\n**15. Should I keep my figures sealed?**\n\nThat is, of course, up to you really, but here are a few things to keep in mind when debating this question:\n\n* **Keeping it sealed can actually damage your figure.** PVC figures usually have something called plasticizer in them, and that plasticizer needs to be able to breath. If a PVC figure isn\u2019t exposed to oxygen, after a period of time the plasticizer starts to break down and form a sticky substance on the surface of the figure. Simply opening your figures and taking them out of the box prevents this from happening. If you happen to find plasticizer goo on one of your figures, Kahotan has [a handy guide](http://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/2013/06/20/dealing-with-stickiness-on-figures/) for dealing with it.\n* Unlike some other figure markets, **keeping an anime figure sealed won\u2019t raise its value by a whole lot.** In fact, because of the plasticizer problem mentioned above, your figure could actually be in better condition if you open it versus keeping it sealed.\n\n____________________\n\n\n###Finding the Right Figure(s) for You\n\n**16. What are \"scales\" and \"prizes\"? What is the difference between them?**\n\nThose are classifications for figures based on a few factors.\n\n* \"Prizes\" are generally more simply produced figures which are intended to be given as prizes for playing arcade games. They are inexpensive and lack the detail of scale figures, though some prize figure lines have standouts which may approach lower-end scales in quality. That is uncommon and often depends on the individual figure.\n* \"Scales\" are called such because they are nominally designed to be proportional to the dimensions of the character which they are based on. They are generally of much better manufacture and materials than prize figures, allowing for more detail in painting, accessories, or complex poses.\n* \"Trading\" figures appear in gashapon machines or as blind boxes on shop counters, often as sets which include multiple characters. As suggested by the class name, the randomness encourages trading. They are usually very inexpensively-produced, though as with prizes, some series are better than others.\n* \"Non-scale\" encompasses a variety of other categories. It is often used to describe poseable figure lines such as figma and Nendoroids.\n\nIn recent years producers such as Good Smile Company attempted to further bridge the gap between prize quality and scales by introducing figure lines which are intended to be moderately-priced while retaining a higher level of detail than the typical prize figure, to varying levels of success.\n\n**17. There are so many figure companies! Who makes good figures?!**\n\nObviously this is a very subjective question, but as a general starting point, here are a few well renowned figure companies: \n\n* Alter\n* Max Factory\n* Good Smile Company\n* Kotobukiya (usually hit or miss for people. Use your best judgement based off of the prototype)\n* Flare\n* Stronger\n\n**18. I really love \u201cseries X / character X\u201d- how can I check if any figures were ever made for it?**\n\n[My Figure Collection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) can be your best friend here. Simply do a search on the name of the series or character using the search bar located at the top right of the screen, and all associated figures pop up!\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re looking at a figure\u2019s MFC entry, most of the text under the \u201cDetails\u201d section can be clicked on and used to run a search.\n\n**19. How can I commission a custom figure?**\n\nNone of the major figure companies (Alter, Kotobukiya, Good Smile Company, etc.) will take a commission for a single figure. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/35usjy/custom_figure_makers_that_take_commissions_and/) has a few websites in it that you can check out, or you can look into garage kits. Some kit painters would be willing to resculpt, frankenstein together, or otherwise modify kits for the right price.\n\nIf you're looking for help completing a garage kit, /r/brushforhire may be useful.\n\n_____________\n\n\n###Keeping Up with New Announcements\n\n**20. How can I keep up with figure news (announcements, updates, etc.)?**\n\nMost people use a MFC combined with any or all of the following news sites:\n\n* [Neko Magic](http://www.nekomagic.com/)\n* [Alter\u2019s Blog](http://blog.livedoor.jp/alter_info/) (In Japanese)\n* [Kahotan\u2019s Blog](http://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/) (Only GSC and their sister companies)\n\nMany figure companies are active on Twitter, so following them there is recommended for quicker news.\n\nTo use MFC for this I\u2019ll quote question #9.\n\n> If you make an account on MFC you can also subscribe to comments, changes, and pictures via a checkbox on the right hand side of a figure\u2019s listing. Subscribing to any of these things will allow MFC to send you an email anytime the subscription in question updates. Subscribing to \u201cchanges\u201d is a great way to keep up with release dates and delays, among other things.\n\nMost companies have one or more Twitter accounts. Some examples: [Good Smile Company sales](https://twitter.com/gsc_sales), [Good Smile's USA branch](https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US), [Max Factory](https://twitter.com/MXF_official), [AmiAmi Hobby News](https://twitter.com/amiamihobbynews).\n\n**21. Everyone\u2019s excited about something called Wonfes\u2026.. what the heck is that?!**\n\nWonFes (short for Wonder Festival) is a biannual figure expo where many figure producers (both large and small) show off new sculpts and updates to figures already under way. Most companies save their most exciting announcements for WonFes, so we all look forward to the expo whenever it rolls around! Winter Wonder Festival is usually held in February, while Summer Wonder Festival is usually in July. The event has also spread to Shanghai, in the late spring.\n\n**22. One or two (or 15) figures were announced at WonFes that I\u2019m really excited about! How can I keep track of their progress once the event is over?**\n\nMFC is always really quick about getting new WonFes announcements (or any others throughout the year, for that matter) listed in their database, so we suggest using that. To find a figure from the event you can search any number of things, including the name of the character or the name of the show. You can also use the tag search to search \u201cWonder_Festival_ 20xx_[season]\u201d to see all items announced at that event.",

However, as time passes, Anki's manual becomes more and more outdated compared to this guide.\n\nThe links above are the most important ones.

Quand je n'appr\u00e9cie pas une personne et vice versa, je ne vais pas aller lui parler, ni m\u00eame la saluer vu qu'on ne me r\u00e9pond pas de route fa\u00e7on. (J'essaie 3 fois avant de laisser tomber. Un peu de politesse tout de m\u00eame)\n\n\n\nAlors, voil\u00e0 les probl\u00e8mes maintenant:\n\n-Je suis l\u00e0 seule personne de couleur de l'entreprise. Je suis metisse. Et mon m\u00e9tissage ne leur pla\u00eet pas. Une de mes origines est OK. Mais pas l'autre. Alors, je suis harcel\u00e9e depuis mon arriv\u00e9e. On m'appelle \"la negres*e\", \"l'escl*ve\" par exemple. On m'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que je bossait comme de la m*rde, que je devrais me prendre un coup de gaz (cette personne est n*zi...).\n\n-Je me fais aussi harceler \u00e0 cause de ma tenue vestimentaire. Je dois aller me faire soigner car c'est pas normal d'\u00eatre frileux. Mes coll\u00e8gues sont tous \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 \u00e0 poil. Les filles surtout. Legging hyper serr\u00e9 (on voit tout \u00e0 travers et certaines ne mette RIEN en dessous), crop top ect ect. Pas des tenues pour travailler. Mais non, c'est moi qu'on vient emb\u00eater. Alors une fois, je me suis habill\u00e9e un peu plus l\u00e9ger. R\u00e9sultat, je suis tomb\u00e9e malade, pendant 2 semaines, mais seulement 4 jours d'arr\u00eat, et je me suis faite insult\u00e9 par mes employeurs car je suis revenue en manteau avec un masque en tissu. \"Ce n'est pas normal pour un mois de juin. Impossible que tu sois tomb\u00e9e malade \u00e0 cause de la climatisation. Il fait pas froid. Faut que tu arr\u00eates de mentir.\" Je rappelle que je bouge pas de mon poste...\n\n-Justement, je bouge jamais compar\u00e9 \u00e0 mes coll\u00e8gues. Elles sont jamais \u00e0 l'heure. Toujours en retard. Jamais \u00e0 leur poste car toujours \u00e0 la machine \u00e0 caf\u00e9 ou \u00e0 discuter dans un coin. Le fait que ces madame ne soient jamais \u00e0 leur poste, fait que, elles font jamais le minimum de production demand\u00e9. M\u00eame si c'est juste 10pcs/h. Elles y arrivent pas. La qualit\u00e9 des pi\u00e8ces... Elle est inexistante! Retour client ou sinon, on doit y retoucher. Et souvent, c'est moi qui m'en rends compte quand je prend le poste derri\u00e8re elles. Elle ab\u00eement les posages dans la machine donc \u00e7a ab\u00eeme les pi\u00e8ces. Elles ne font jamais changer les outils. Elles regardent pas les pi\u00e8ces au visuel, ne font pas les contr\u00f4les demand\u00e9 donc, si la pi\u00e8ces est mauvaises, elles le savent pas et continuent comme \u00e7a. Tranquille. Par chance, ou non, c'est souvent moi qui signale le/les probl\u00e8me/s en prenant le poste derri\u00e8re elles. Donc elle se font \"engueuler\" le lendemain. Mais non. C'est pas elles. C'est moi qui ait fait \u00e7a ou qui veut saboter leur travail. Mes responsables n'ont jamais pris ma d\u00e9fense car \"On a confiance en ton travail, on sait que c'est pas toi.\" Mais en attendant, peu importe le poste, que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 dessus ou non, quand il y'a des probl\u00e8mes, les coll\u00e8gues mettent tout sur mon dos. \n\n-Je dis bonjour seulement \u00e0 mes responsables, quand il veulent bien venir me dire bonjour. Je parle avec une seule personne dans toute l'entreprise. Ce jeune homme est devenu mon meilleur ami et essaie de prendre ma d\u00e9fense comme il peut sans se mettre dans la m*rde aussi. Mais des fois, \u00e7a lui retombe dessus. Si les gens veulent me parler, ils passent par lui par exemple. Alors que, si c'est pour le travail, je vais parler \u00e0 ces gens l\u00e0. Ils essaient de me faire passer pour la m\u00e9chante quoi. Si je suis absente, mes responsables vont le harceler pour savoir ce qui m'arrive au lieu de m'appeler (m\u00eame si je les pr\u00e9viens par SMS et qu'ils me r\u00e9pondent). Si je vais pas bien, et bien, c'est lui qu'ils envoent pour savoir ce que j'ai. (Trop compliqu\u00e9 de venir me parler apparemment).\n\n-Je me suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9fendue quand une personne venait me harceler. Mais non, c'est moi qui me suis faite convoqu\u00e9e et remont\u00e9e mes bretelles. Je me d\u00e9fend plus et \u00e7a a empir\u00e9. On sabote mes machines. Je me fais insult\u00e9 de tout les noms possible. On m'accuse de tout et n'importe quoi. Mais mes employeurs font les autruches quand je vais leur en parler. Une fois, la femme avait \u00e9tal\u00e9 de l'huile au sol. Le matin, j'ai faillit tomb\u00e9 3 fois. Je n'ai pas lav\u00e9 le sol pour y montrer \u00e0 un responsable. Il a constat\u00e9 et \u00e0 dit que je dramatisais les choses. (Il n'y a pas d'huile sur ce poste!). Il lui a parl\u00e9 le lendemain et elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle a voulu faire le m\u00e9nage et qu'elle a vu que c'\u00e9tait huil\u00e9 mais avait pas le temps de relaver. Alors, \u00e0 quel moment on lave le sol en trempant la serpilli\u00e8re dans le seau d'huile de la machine en face? On pouvait suivre les traces. Mais bon, il l'a cru et m'a demand\u00e9 en gros de me calmer et d'arr\u00eater de me plaindre pour rien. \n\n-Quand je m'absentais, m\u00eame quand je n'avais pas de joir de cong\u00e9 dispo, ils m'ont pay\u00e9. Je leur doit 12 jours de travail maintenant. C'est l\u00e9gal \u00e7a?\n-J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 port\u00e9 plainte contre un coll\u00e8gue pour harc\u00e8lement. Il me suivait partout, il me regardait avec des envies de meurtre, il me disait des choses pas tr\u00e8s catholiques. Il ont fini par le vir\u00e9 au bout de 4 mois ou j'ai v\u00e9cu un enfer. Mais bon. C'est uniquement car j'ai port\u00e9 plainte et leur ait donn\u00e9 un double de la plainte et que les gendarmes les ont appel\u00e9 pour avoir les vid\u00e9os surveillances. Sinon, ils \u00e9taient juste aller lui dire de pas m'approcher. \u00c7a l'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de m'attendre sur le parking ou derri\u00e8re la porte des WC. \n\n\n\nMa question est, si je d\u00e9missionne, je dois faire \u00e7a comment? Je leur doit 12 jours de boulot. Mais malheureusement, ma conscience professionnelle est hyper forte. Je ne veux pas partir d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 car je sais que sans moi, ils vont encore perdre des clients. On a perdu le plus gros car j'ai refus\u00e9 de travailler dans un secteur. R\u00e9sultat, ils ont envoy\u00e9 de la m*erde en retard en plus. La, je suis en poste pour l'autre gros client. Mes pi\u00e8ces sont hyper co\u00fbteuse. Si je pars, ils le perdent. Je suis la seule \u00e0 savoir faire les pi\u00e8ces... Mais de l'autre, ils prennent pas \"soin\" de moi. Je suis en d\u00e9pression, ils le savent car je leur ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit. Je suis sous pay\u00e9e \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt, pour tout le travail que je fournis. (1600e pour 37,5h par semaine. Aucune prime. Rien. Aucun avantage!). Et les connaissant, quand je vais annoncer mon d\u00e9part, ils vont aller harceler mon pote pour savoir pourquoi je part et qu'ils me retienne. Je ne veux pas lui causer de soucis...\"\n\nSi vous avez des questions ou des conseils pour elle, on est preneurs! Merci \u00e0 vous! (Ceci est r\u00e9el. C'est des fous dans sa bo\u00eete.)",

Here are some tips and tools to help you use it.\n\n*  The subreddit has a [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/wiki) that is regularly updated with answers to commonly-asked questions.  Check it out.  The answer to your question may already be in there.\n\n*  Asking a question about a report on a file or website from a service like Hybrid Analysis, MetaDefender, Triage, or VirusTotal?  You **must** include the actual link to it and not just a screenshot, or your post will be removed.\n\n*  Be kind to each other and be professional in your conduct here.  Personal attacks will not be tolerated and will be dealt with appropriately.\n\n*  Do not ask for copies of hacking tools, malware, or suspicious files.  If someone sends you a chat request or private message asking for a file or offering assistance based on what you posted here, report them to Reddit and notify the mods.\n\n*  Do not post direct links to malicious, suspect, or potentially unsafe files or web sites.\n\n*  Follow [Reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). This means correctly upvoting and downvoting posts, and reporting posts with dangerous or unsafe advice to the mods.\n\n*  If you work for a vendor of security products, services, or in a related field, you must identify yourself as such, either in the post or with flair.  Also, you may not steer conversations to your products or services, only respond to posts about them to clarify or defend.\n\n*  No low-effort, off-topic, spam, or meme posts.  This includes AI/ChatGPT/LLM-generated text, questions about password manager or VPNs, requests for assistance with non-security related software like autoclickers or MP3 downloaders, and so forth.\n\n*  No requests for assistance with pirated software or media.\n\n*  Posts may be removed and threads closed at any time based on the moderators' discretion\n\nThe complete list of rules for the subreddit can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/about/rules/).

Spotlight topics are not mutually exclusive, but given just how many notable causes and awareness events, we can't list all of them in a single post. Please visit our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=effbe2dce5acb460cb837f82579f9b4bc5cfadd02857b407019ceda56f6051e4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) to view other deserving causes and feel free to talk about them and your experiences!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's Tuesday and you know what that means, the sub is in restricted mode (meaning you can comment on existing posts but cannot make a new post for the day). We started this as a protest against Reddit back in June/July but it was decided that we would continue restricting each Tuesday for a few reasons. \n\n1: To encourage people to get off of Reddit for a day and do something else, anything else. Pet a cat, write a fic, touch some grass, go see a movie, whatever. Just go do something else than Reddit for a day if you are able.\n\n2: To give the mods a day off/a day to work on secondary tasks for the sub and clean things up each week\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly...\n\n3: To spend the day highlighting and discussing disability, accessibility, and diversity.  AO3 has always been very good on accessibility and a lot of the world and internet is not, and fandom spaces have been known to be not the best about disability or diversity, so while we are restricted we like to shine a light on these often overlooked parts of fandom and the people that make up this group.  So we have these threads where you can post your fic recs and self-promo about anything to do with disability and/or diversity, and also so people have a safe space to share their stories and discuss these topics.  \n\nGiven the nature of this thread as a safe space for discussion of disability and diversity, we will be much stricter regarding civility and harassment. This includes the following thread specific rules:\n\n**Do not derail:** No hijacking the thread for unrelated topics/discussions.\n\n**Do not talk over others:** Everyone has their own individual experiences and challenges that may differ, and we ask that you show each other respect and do not talk over those sharing their experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are sharing a rec or self-promo with these themes, please use the following format:\n\nRating:  \n\nFandom:  \n\nArchive Warnings:  \n\nTags:  \n\nOther Notes:  \n\nLink:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~The Mod Team\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking for the regular [Bi-weekly Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/wiki/index/megathreads)?\n\n Don't forget to check out [our new forum](https://forumofourown.createaforum.com/) \\- hop on over and get the conversation started!",

Here's some questions that help with that, so go over them and see if you can add information to your comment:\n\n- What mode are you talking about?\n\n- What do you consider good/bad/fair matchmaking [in that mode]? What do you think is healthiest, individually and/or for the player base as a whole (across skill levels)?\n\n- What kind of matchmaking do you want for ranked/pubs/mixtape/solos? [possibly: completely random matchmaking; loose skill based matchmaking/tight skill based matchmaking; loose rank based matchmaking in ranked/tight rank based matchmaking; something else]\n\n- What kind of matchmaking are you experiencing (vs what you want from that mode)? In what ways is it a problem?\n\n- How do you assess the strength of your lobby / strength of players you are facing? Badges (which ones) / trackers / current rank / ...?\n\n- What is your current rank?\n\n- What is your skill level (highest previously achieved ranks)?\n\n- How should matchmaking deal with parties of varied skill (or rank) / how does it deal with it / how good/bad is the experience (and again it's important to distinguish whether you're talking about ranked or pubs here)?\n\n- With regards to smurfing: How much of a problem is / how does it affect your experience / how easy is it to do/how common is it / What to do against it?\n\n- Thoughts on ranked resets (their effect on matchmaking)\n\n- What is your experience of matchmaking in high ranks / matchmaking in low ranks? How does it match with what you expect from ranked?\n\n- The above mostly focuses on \"skill\", but since it's come up recently from time to time (with XDefiant as well), what are your views on input based matchmaking (including potentially negative effects it might have on all of the above). Remember to please keep it civil as this is a topic that constantly leads to toxicity and incivility / personal attacks, rather than level-headed discussion of arguments.\n\n- Related to the previous point, what about cross play between PC / console?\n\n- [I might add more points here if anything comes to mind.]\n\nYou can also post proof of the situations you're encountering (links to screenshots / clips, you can upload them on imgur or similar).\n\n---\n\nFor reference, here's some old articles posted by respawn on the principles of matchmaking in the game\n\nJan 2023 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/matchmaking-2023\n\nsome of the ranked dev blogs on the old systems and current system which also contain some information on ranked matchmaking\n\nS13 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/saviors-ranked-update\n\nS17 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-ranked-2023-update\n\nS18 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/july-2023-ranked-dev-blog\n\nS19 https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/17a41s1/dev_team_update_ranked_october_2023/\n\nS20 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-patch-notes and https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1ajjwff/apex_legends_season_20_breakout_early_information/\n\n---\n\nAt least for the time this thread stays stickied (~ this week), discussion of these topics should be concentrated here rather than individual posts (as per our rules).",

How will YOU stack up against everyone else in your Rank?\n\n\n#PATCH NOTES\n\n**BALANCE UPDATES**\n\n**Care Package**\n\n- Purple light mag added\n\n**Gold Weapons Rotation**\n\n- Nemesis Burst AR, Triple-Take, Peacekeeper, Prowler PDW, Longbow DMR\n\n**End Rings**\n\n- End rings now have more even distribution through the map\n\n- Each quadrant of the map now have roughly 25% chance of getting selected\n\n**Survival Slot Items**\n\n- Survival slot items have been redistributed to low tier loot zones\n\n*Dev Note: Survival slot items were not spawning in all our loot quality zones. This adjustment maintains a similar number of survival slot items in a match but more evenly distributes them across the map.*\n\n**WEAPONS & ATTACHMENTS**\n\n**G7 Scout**\n\n- Damage increased to 33 (was 32)\n\n- Rate of fire increased\n\n- Adjusted recoil to be more consistent when firing at max fire rate\n\n*Dev Note: The G7 has felt a little underwhelming and our data backs that up. When we were evaluating its rate of fire we realized its recoil could use a pass as well so we\u2019ve smoothed out what we think the roughest spots are and given it a little more damage. This should help the G7 be competitive with the rest of our marksman and sniper roster.*\n\n**Havoc Rifle**\n\n- All mag sizes reduced\n\n    - No Mag: 20 (was 24)\n\n    - White Mag: 24 (was 28)\n\n    - Blue Mag: 28 (was 32)\n\n    - Purple Mag: 32 (was 36)\n\n*Dev Note: The Havoc is a force to be reckoned with, even without all the bells and whistles of mags and turbochargers it still puts in work. However, 36 rounds in a kitted Havoc, even with the firing delay, represents high damage up time and forgiveness for wasted rounds (often experienced during prefiring). Pulling back on mags allows it to remain deadly, but requires a little more precision.*\n\n**Longbow DMR**\n\n- Headshot multiplier increased to 2.25 (was 2.15)\n\n**R-99 SMG**\n\n- Reduced hip-fire randomness \n\n*Dev Note: Over the last few patches we nerfed the R-99 because it was a significant outlier, performing well above the rest of the pack. Those nerfs were substantial and the R-99 has fallen a little too far for our liking and is feeling unreliable. These adjustments intend to bring up its consistency without directly increasing its damage potential.*\n\n**Rampage LMG**\n\n- Firing animation has less vertical movement while in ADS\n\n**Weapon Rarity Sets**\n\n- Peacekeeper (Blue and Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 1x Hcog (was 2x Bruiser)\n\n- Charge Rifle & Sentinel (Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 4-8x (was 2-4x)\n\n    - Gunrun will keep a 2-4x\n\n**4x-10x Digital Threat Scope**\n\n- Will no longer provide threat vision through smoke or gas\n\n**LEGENDS**\n\n**Alter**\n\n- Void Passage: Crypto EMP will now affect all players phased by the Void Passage\n\n**Bangalore**\n\n- Smoke Launcher: all players within smoke will now have a white highlight visible to other players in smoke within 20m\n\n*Dev Note: Fighting inside Bangalore's smoke has never been a pleasant experience for players or viewers (aside from you Bloodhounds) as it makes fights messy and hard to read. We are leveling the playing field now by making all players inside smoke clearer targets to one another with a white highlight. This highlight is not visible from outside the smoke: all of the rotational and sight-blocking gameplay are kept in-tact. However, while playing inside the smoke will be more clear, it will also be more risky and resets will be much harder if the smoke is challenged.*\n\n**Bloodhound**\n\n- Beast of the Hunt: threat vision is no longer visible through smoke or gas\n\n- Upgrade: Level 2\n\n    - Raven\u2019s Blessing: Ult charge reduced to 20% (was 25%)\n\n- Upgrades: Level 3\n\n    - NEW Sighthound: reduced Tac cooldown by 50% while Ultimate is active\n\n    - NEW Flock: remove enemy range requirement for White Raven spawns\n\n*Dev Note: Sometimes even the best teams break up and go their separate ways. Bloodhound's Ult has always had a strong synergy with Bangalore\u2019s smoke, but the pairing has recently become dominant and a singular answer to the \"can't see stuff\" meta. With the removal of threat vision through smoke, Bloodhound will need to rely on their Tac scan like other Recon Legends. This should remove the necessity for the dynamic duo to pair together and allow for new roster compositions to form in its wake.*\n\n*We were noticing how much the White Raven passive would fall off in the late game as enemies are naturally closer, making Raven\u2019s Blessing upgrade much less valuable after the first ring. The new Level 3 upgrade will allow players to play off White Ravens across the match and fuel their Ult more effectively.*\n\n*Alternatively, players can now tap back into some of Bloodhound\u2019s old scan potential while in their Ult. These changes aim to shift power away from simply securing knocks for late game benefit and into more opportunities to use the Ult or the Tac through new upgrade choices.*\n\n[see full table of updated perks on original article]\n\n**Pathfinder**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Down & Away: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**Revenant**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Grim Leaper: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**MAPS**\n\n- PUBS: Broken Moon / Kings Canyon / Olympus\n\n- RANKED: Broken Moon / Olympus / World\u2019s Edge\n\n\n**MODES**\n\n**Quads**\n\n- Replacing Duos Playlist for S21.1\n\n- 15 Teams of 4 Players\n\n- Loot Improvements\n\n    - Chance to find Blue/Purple kitted weapons\n\n    - Increased ammo in Light, Heavy, and Energy ammo boxes\n\n    - Increased chance to find ammo, health, shield, scopes, and deployable items\n\n    - Increased Replicator starting count 12\u219215\n\n- Lobby supports a 4th player for inviting and \u2018Previous Match Squad Members\u2019\n\n- Legend Ability updates to support a 4th squad member\n\n    - Mirage Decoy shows 4 squad members when dropping from the dropship\n\n    - Valkyrie\u2019s Ult allows for up to 3 additional squad members to attach\n\n    - Vantage Passive can spot the armor on all enemy teammates when in ADS\n\n    - Loba\u2019s Ultimate has UI to support a fourth player\n\nNOTE: Quads is the only mode that supports queueing with 4 players.

Ranked entry cost, placement, and KP tuning updated to:\n\n- Lower entry cost above Bronze Tier\n\n    - Gold: 35 (was 40)\n\n    - Platinum: 55 (was 60)\n\n    - Diamond: 75 (was 80)\n\n- Placement RP Tuning now follows ALGS rules that all Top 15 will gain points\n\n    - 15th: 5 (was 0)\n\n    - 14th: 5 (was 0)\n\n- Kill Point Tuning\n\n    - 8th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 7th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 6th: 16 (was 12)\n\n*Dev Note: we have received valuable insights from last season's data and community feedback and made slight adjustments based on both. The entry cost above Bronze has been lowered slightly, all of the Top 15 players will now receive corresponding placement points, and increased the KP for players in the top 6th-8th positions. With the potential for more updates to come as we continue to monitor.*\n\n*We reward players for excellent strategic choices in placement and for outstanding combat performances in Kills. Achieving Top 5 placement in many ways is your strategic choice, but we won't reward you with additional points; you must validate your placement with eliminations.*\n\n\n**BUG FIXES**\n\nLooking for something else?

On tizen some apps have good animations (Netflix, Youtube) and some have bad animations (Max, Amazon). The only app with bad animations on my apple TV was Plex. The slight glow and tilt when you select something and slightly rub your finger on the touch surface is a nice too. The remote is extremely uncomfortable and weirdly laid out tho.

        "content": "Erfahrung \u00fcber den Einsatz bei einer sehr kleinen Firma die anscheinend nichts dazugelernt hat... Zumindest noch nicht.\n\nIch habe vor ca. einem Jahr in einem Unternehmen angefangen. Bei dem Einstellungsgespr\u00e4ch wurde mir zweimal deutlich versprochen dass die Arbeitszeit ab Wohnort gilt. Pl\u00f6tzlich zwei Monate nachdem ich dann schon angefangen hatte, kommt mein Vorgesetzter auf mich zu und behauptet dies wurde niemals so vereinbart. Ich darf mir die Zeit ab Ankunft bei der Firma aufschreiben.\n\n Ich war damals ehrlich gesagt etwas naiv, und habe auf die m\u00fcndliche Zusage vertraut. Und sp\u00e4ter im Arbeitsvertrag nicht genauer nachgehakt. Da stand nichts definiert \u00fcber Beginn der Arbeitszeit, es stand nur:  Arbeitsort ist \"Name der Stadt & Firmengeb\u00e4ude\". Ich muss dazu erw\u00e4hnen das mein Aufgabengebiet zu 80% im Au\u00dfendienst habe! Ich habe damals niemals damit gerechnet dass sich dies auf Beginn der Arbeitszeit bezieht. Ja heute bin ich schlauer. \n\nTrotz allem habe ich auf das m\u00fcndliche versprechen hingewiesen und das mehrmals bei meinen Vorgesetzten, die \u00fcbrigens innerhalb von 9 Monaten dreimal gewechselt haben, ausdr\u00fccklich erw\u00e4hnt. Alle Versuche endeten ohne Einsicht. \nMan wollte mir dies auf gar keinen Fall erf\u00fcllen. Ich habe mehrmals erkl\u00e4rt dass dies f\u00fcr mich damals ausschlaggebend war um bei dieser Stelle anzufangen. \n\nIch habe auch offen kommuniziert das ich mir so langfristig keine weitere Zusammenarbeit vorstellen kann. \nDies hat man selbstverst\u00e4ndlich nicht ernst genommen!\nMan hat immer wieder sehr abweisend reagiert und auch behauptet keine andere Firma w\u00fcrde heutzutage noch so eine Bedingung anbieten.... \nHabe mich dann kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter bei mehreren Firmen beworben. \nDie meisten dieser Firmen hatten genau diese Bedingung in der Stellenbeschreibung drin: Arbeitszeit beginnt ab Wohnort.\n Interessant ist dabei auch, dass mein direkter Arbeitskollege, der das Gleiche tut wie ich, genau dies doch in seinem Vertrag drin stehen hat. Arbeitszeit ab Wohnort. \n\nJetzt hat es sich ja doch so entwickelt dass ich eine sehr gute Stelle gefunden habe wo mir dies genauso angeboten wird plus 15% mehr Gehalt. \nDie Firma bei der ich momentan noch bin, hat sehr lange nach einer Arbeitskraft wie mir damals gesucht und auch sehr viel Geld und Zeit investiert um mich in diesem Fachgebiet auszubilden.\nDaher ist es mir umso unverst\u00e4ndlicher dass man dann mit mir so grob fahrl\u00e4ssig umgeht.\nJetzt haben Sie das Nachsehen, m\u00fcssen wieder jemand neues suchen, einen Haufen Zeit und Geld in seine Einarbeitung stecken. \n\nUnd das einfach nur weil man eindeutige Versprechen nicht einhalten kann. Dieses Problem ist aber in dieser Fa. nicht neu. \nEs sind schon unz\u00e4hlige gute Mitarbeiter genau wegen solcher Probleme gegangen. \nUnd die Fa. hat einen enormen Mangel an Mitarbeiter und einen gro\u00dfen Bedarf, da es sich um eine spezielle Branche handelt. \n\nIch wollte dies nur mal so erw\u00e4hnen zu dem angeblichen \"Facharbeitermangel\" der \u00fcberall herrscht. Manche scheinen dazu noch komplett Begriffsresistent zu sein. Bei Kununu wird demn\u00e4chst ein sch\u00f6ner Eintrag stehen. Ich wollte dies nur mal so als interessante Erfahrung mitteilen. ",

Ich habe diese Woche ein finales Interview gehabt, woraufhin ich ein Angebot bekommen habe, welches ich auch schon angenommen habe. \n\nZu meinem Profil kurz aus meinem alten Post: Master BWL Logistik (Schnitt ca 1,35), zwei Auslandssemester in Europa, 6- Monate Praktikum im Logistikmanagement bei einem gro\u00dfen Automobilhersteller, zwei kleinere weniger relevante Werksstudentenstellen.\n\nMeine Bewerbung habe ich zwischen dem 07.05 und dem 26.06 abgeschickt, wobei der Gro\u00dfteil zwischen Ende Mai und Anfang Juni war. Aufgrund der kurzen Zeit zwischen den Bewerbungen und jetzt sind einige noch offen, wobei ich mir auch vorstellen kann, dass gerade die, bei denen noch kein Gespr\u00e4ch stattgefunden hat sich auch nicht mehr positiv melden werden.  Bei allen Stellen bei denen ich nach der Bewerbung im Prozess weitergekommen bin, lag die Antwortdauer zwischen Bewerbung und R\u00fcckmeldung \u00fcbrigens bei ca. 2 Werktagen.\n\nDie Stellen waren eigentlich fast alle Trainee Stellen im Supply Chain Management oder Junior Supply Chain Manager Stellen. Geworden ist es jetzt final ein  SCM Trainee bei einem gro\u00dfen FMCG Konzern. Gehalt sind dabei bei 40 Stunden ca. 62k. Der Bewerbungsprozess war dabei: Bewerbung -> Online AC -> Automatisiertes Online Interview -> Assesment Day (ca. 8 Stunden, Zwei Einzelintervies mit je ca. 75 Minuten, Fragerunde mit Extrainees ca. eine Stunde, Business Game/ Simulation ca. 3 Stunden -> Panel Intwerview mit 3 anderen Bewerbern, 4 Senior Managern + HR ca. zwei Stunden\n\nFalls es zu irgendwas Fragen gibt, immer gerne her damit und vielleicht helfen oder interessieren die Daten ja irgendwem :)",
        "human_comment": "Wenn ich sowas lese frage ich mich manchmal wem im Unternehmen so langweilig war sich solch ein Bewerbungsverfahren zu berlegen und warum sich dann noch genug Verantwortliche finden, die sowas regelmig von Fachabteilungsseite aus betreuen. Hier geht es ja nicht mal um einen entscheidenden Job sondern einen, aus Konzernsicht, eher mittelmig bezahlten Einstiegsjob, wo man whrend der Traineezeit noch mehr als genug ber den Mitarbeiter und sein Potential lernen wrde.",
        "AI_comment": "Ja, 62k als Einstieg ist echt super! Besonders im Vergleich zu anderen Bereichen. Den Master sehe ich auch eher als \"nice to have\" an, aber er hat dir bei dem Assessment Day sicher gut geholfen. Wie war denn das Business Game/Simulation im Assessment Day aufgebaut? War das eher theoretisch oder eher praxisnah? \n"

Die Stadt w\u00e4re schon seit l\u00e4ngerem mein Wunsch-Standort und selbst beim Gehalt gibt es keine gravierenden Diskrepanzen.\nAllerdings habe ich mich auf eine normale Stelle beworben und habe jetzt mitgeteilt bekommen, dass man mich unbedingt in eine Junior-Stelle stecken m\u00f6chte/muss.\nIch habe 6 Jahre Berufserfahrung und einer der Hauptgr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr den Wechsel ist, dass ich mich beruflich weiterentwickeln m\u00f6chte. D.h. mehr (F\u00fchrungs-) Verantwortung \u00fcbernehmen, mehr Entscheidungskompetenzen, eigenverantwortliches arbeiten, n\u00e4her ans Management r\u00fccken und nicht erst \u00fcber 13,5 Hierarchieebenen kommunizieren. \nDas alles scheint mir die Junior-Stelle nicht mehr zu bieten. \nFinde nur ich das respektlos?\nIm Vergleich zu meinen bisherigen Aufgaben und Verantwortungen w\u00e4re das definitiv ein R\u00fcckschritt. Das w\u00fcrde bestimmt auch zumindest bl\u00f6d im Lebenslauf aussehen und die eine oder andere R\u00fcckfrage generieren, sowie mich in meiner weiteren Karriere zur\u00fcckwerfen.\n\nWas w\u00fcrdet ihr tun? \nAuf die normale Stelle bestehen und sich im Fall einer Absage freuen, dass man eine Red flag abgewehrt hat?\nDie Junior-Stelle annehmen und auf die m\u00fcndlich zugesicherten vielf\u00e4ltigen Entwicklungsperspektiven hoffen? Anschlie\u00dfend ggf. die n\u00e4chsten Jahre trotzdem in der Junior-Stelle verk\u00fcmmern weil man sich verarschen lassen hat?\nWerde auf jeden Fall noch das Gespr\u00e4ch suchen, aber bin mir noch absolut unschl\u00fcssig welche Entscheidung ich daraus ziehen w\u00fcrde.",
        "human_comment": "Ganz grundstzlich gesprochen, da es aus deinem Post nicht hervorgeht: Unternehmen haben unterschiedliche Vorstellungen von Senioritt und die Berufserfahrung ist erstmal nachrangig. Ein Senior in einem groen Tech Unternehmen muss ganz andere Anforderungen erfllen als in der kleinen Frickelbude von neben an.\n\nAbgesehen davon: hast du dich denn auf die gleiche Stelle/Jobfamilie beworben wie bei deinem aktuellen Arbeitgeber? Wenn nein, ist es nochmal eine ganz andere Diskussion, da deine bisherige Erfahrung nur in Teilen fr die neue Stelle passt. :)",
        "AI_comment": "Ich verstehe deine Bedenken total. Eine Junior-Stelle nach 6 Jahren Berufserfahrung wirkt tats\u00e4chlich wie ein R\u00fcckschritt und kann auch im Lebenslauf seltsam aussehen.  Wenn es dir wirklich um mehr Verantwortung und Entscheidungsfreiheit geht, w\u00fcrde ich die Stelle nur dann annehmen, wenn es klare schriftliche Zusagen zur Entwicklung und zum Aufstieg gibt. Ohne diese w\u00e4re es f\u00fcr mich ein No-Go. \n"

Verdiene derzeit 62.400\u20ac ohne Boni, Raum NRW\n\nAus diversen Vorstellungsgespr\u00e4chen und etwa Recherche habe ich jedoch das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich mich gehaltlich nicht wirklich weiterentwickeln kann (zumindest im Ingenieurb\u00fcro als Planer) Daher suche ich gerade nach M\u00f6glichkeit, wie ich mich weiterentwickeln kann.\n\nWoran ich bereits gedacht habe\n\n* Wechsel innerhalb der Baubranche in Richtung Bau\u00fcberwachung/Bauleitung. Soweit ich wei\u00df, kann man dort besser verdienen, denke jedoch, dass die Work-Life-Balance schlechter ist\n* Wechsel in Richtung Projektmanagement und Consulting\n* Wechsel in Richtung IT, vielleicht etwas mit Software / BIM, spezifisch f\u00fcr die Baubranche? W\u00fcrde mich eigentlich ziemlich f\u00fcr sowas interessieren, wei\u00df aber nicht, wo ich da einsteigen kann. \n* Wechsel in Ausland (Schweiz, USA?) Muss nicht unbedingt in Deutschland bleiben. Hat hier jemand Erfahrung mit gemacht?\n* Kompletter Branchenwechsel und als \"Quereinsteiger\" wo anders anfangen. Ich denke jedoch nicht, dass sich sowas f\u00fcr mich lohnen w\u00fcrde. Lasse mich da gerne aber eines Besseren belehren\n\nVielleicht hat ja irgendwer von euch eine \u00e4hnliche Berufslaufbahn eingeschlagen und kann mir einen Rat geben.

        "AI_comment": "Stimmt, Ingenieure gelten oft als Topverdiener, aber leider ist das nicht immer so.  Die Realit\u00e4t ist, dass die Geh\u00e4lter im Bauingenieurwesen oft von der Branche, der Unternehmensgr\u00f6\u00dfe und dem Arbeitsort abh\u00e4ngen. Es gibt viele Ingenieure, die zwar ein gutes Gehalt verdienen, aber nicht unbedingt im Vergleich zu anderen Branchen, wie z.B. in der IT.

Thanks to Brian, this issue has been resolved, ensuring translations happen seamlessly each time.\n> - Bug Fix for Window Restoration After Restart: Thanks to Sherry, we have fixed an issue where, upon restarting, Arc would restore a temporary window that made it difficult to access spaces and pinned tabs. Now, we restore a full window with each restart, along with the temporary one if that was the last one closed.\n> - Small Design Polish for Account Settings: Alexandra has added some tiny-but-mighty design polish to account settings, making all widths of setting menus consistent for a more streamlined appearance.\n> - Longstanding Tab Closing Fix: Thanks to Seb, Adam, and Maya, we've fixed a longstanding issue that caused tabs to be archived ahead of your specified \"Archive tabs after...\" setting \u2014 improving tab management reliability.\n\n[**Release Notes**](<https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/22513842649623-Arc-for-Windows-2023-2024-Release-Notes>) \u2013 [**Download Arc for Windows**](<https://releases.arc.net/windows/prod/1.8.0.34917/Arc.x64.msix>)",

The patient has had the brain tumor for the entirety of his stay and treatment on my wife's floor.\n\nShe was just informed of this yesterday. One of the occupational therapists mentioned this and said that \"only pregnant women need to worry about the levels of radiation he's emitting\". \n\nMy wife had not yet told anyone other than her boss that she's pregnant due to her only being 10 weeks along, but had to tell everyone now that she's been exposed to this patient (her telling people is basically a non-issue in relation to the radioactive patient she's been seeing). She also is refusing to see him now which everyone agrees is the best option.\n\n We have called our OBGYN office, and they seemed concerned. They will be referring to our Dr. soon. \n\nMy legal question, and maybe it's too soon to know, but if something happens to the baby, how likely would we be able to make a case against the hospital?

Obviously all of this is fairly new and is ongoing, but I'm just curious what our next steps would be if something happens.\n\nEdit: because people are mentioning it in the comments, my wife did disclose her pregnancy to her boss prior to this patient coming to her floor.

She works four consecutive days a week.\n\nWhen she told her boss, she signed paperwork that stated she was pregnant and was disclosing that to the hospital at large, but due to it being so recent and new hadn't told her coworkers.

    "Do you really want to become a car salesperson?": {
        "title": "Do you really want to become a car salesperson?",
        "content": "It seems like more and more people are asking about if car sales is the right career for them.  Below are my observations on the industry and hopefully it helps you make a better decision.  \n\n  \nCar sales can be an extremely rewarding profession with professional growth opportunities and a wide variety of positions.  While this can come with above average pay, it also tends to come with below average benefits, above average hours worked, and inconsistent pay.  Hours and pay will vary by location, store pay plan, and store performance.  \n\nSalesperson Schedule and Pay Progression\n\n* Year 0-3, the first few years at any job tend to be the toughest, car sales is no different.  Many dealer groups offer 0 vacation time to new employees before the 1 year mark.  For the first 2-3 years, Green Peas (new salespeople) will likely work 50-70 hours per week, with many of them skipping their day off to work.  While this is not a requirement, car sales is very much \"get out what you put in\" and you have to be at the store to help customers.  Pay during this time may be all commission or a small base plus commission.  Either way, earnings will likely be <65-80k.  \n*  Year 3-5 is the next step.  The car salesperson should now start seeing repeat and referral business.  This not only means more sales, but also a chance at less work.  Since salespeople at this stage have more business coming in, they may start to work less and see the occasional 45 hour week.  Most weeks will be in the 50 hour range with some hitting 60.  At this stage, earnings will likely be in the <$90k range for the above average performer and <$130k for the great ones.  At most stores this is the point where someone may begin to be considered for a promotion.  \n*  Year 5+ is relatively steady.  The salesperson now has an established book of business with a strong sales base from repeat and referral business.  This will get better and better over time, but now is when the real difference starts to show.  People that are still in the business at this point will forever be able to make a career out of it.  At this point, the hours are much better with the occasional <40hr week with most weeks in the 45-50hr range.  While income is relatively unchanged, a new tier starts to emerge at >$150k.  While not at every store, they exist with some breaking $200k+.\n\nSalesperson Income Breakdown\n\n* 50% of sales people in the industry make <$65k.  This will not be their career and they will be on the chopping block if cuts need to be made.\n* 30% make <$90k.  These people can make a career out of car sales and will always have a job.\n* 18% make <$130k.  These people are above average performers and often the top salesperson at their store.\n* 2% make >$150k.  While not at every store, these salespeople have mastered the job.  They have great repeat and referral business.  They also tend to be more autonomous, closing their own deals and working as needed.  \n\nCar Sales Career Progression Track\n\nCareer growth at most stores follows a similar path with the majority of promotions coming from within.  It is rare that a store hires someone from another store and promotes them, the main exception to this is the jump to GSM and GM.\n\n* 3-5 years as a consistent high performer and a promotion to F&I becomes a real option.  F&I handle all of the paperwork and financing, they no longer have to go on test drives, but they are still selling in one form or another.  They tend to work long hours since they are the final touchpoint for a customer.  Depending on the store set up, this could mean 50-60 hour weeks.  Pay can range from $100k-$200k+.  \n* 2-4 years as a strong performer in F&I and a promotion to Sales Manager becomes and option (some stores will break off here with the option of a Used Car Manager, or Commercial/Fleet Manager).  Much like F&I the managers need to be present and will often work over 50 hours.  Pay can range from $120k-$250k+  \n* 2-6 years as a strong Sales Manager and promotion to GSM becomes an option.  At this stage you are leading the entire sales department, at many stores they may also be a floor manager that desks deals.  They likely work <50 hours a week unless they are filling in for someone.  Pay can range from $200k to over $400k.  \n* 4-6 years as a strong GSM and promotion to GM becomes an option.  This is the top position at most stores (save the occasional dealer principal/owner that also works).  They are experts at selling cars and usually have over a decade of strong performance in every position.  They can fill in any gaps as needed.  At some stores they may have also done some stints in Parts & Service just to experience them.  They usually work <45 hours a week.  Pay can range from $300k to $800k+\n\nIs Car Sales Right For You?\n\n* Do you enjoy talking to people?, While you do not need to be the life of the party, talking to strangers should not scare you.  \n* Are you capable of memorizing things like car features and available colors?  While you do not need to be an expert and know the torque setting of the nuts on the rear differential, you will be expected to have a general knowledge of available features on your brand's vehicles as well as things like available colors, interiors and the like.  \n* Are you able to regularly work long hours?  While later in the career the hours become more manageable, early on you are working all the time, and dinner will often be after 6pm.  \n* Are you able to manage your money?  While making this a career can be financially rewarding, it is inconsistent.  Some months might be $2k and others might be $10k, so you need to be able to save from the good months to survive the bad ones.  ",

Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Season the salmon fillets well with salt and pepper, and place them on a plate or in a large shallow bowl.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, miso, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and garlic. Pour the mixture on top of the salmon and gently massage the marinade all over the fish. Let marinate while the oven comes to temperature.\n3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss together the green beans with the olive oil, red-pepper flakes and sesame oil (if using) and season generously with salt and pepper. Lay the salmon fillets on the sheet pan skin side down and spread the green beans out surrounding the fillets.\n4. Arrange the salmon skin side down on the sheet pan and bake until the salmon is opaque and the green beans are cooked through, about 12 minutes. Right before serving, scatter with cilantro and a good squeeze of lime. Season with flaky sea salt and serve with rice, if desired.",

Several of his relatives had farms he would stay on. \n\nWhen he turned 18 he was drafted into the Navy and was deployed to Pearl Harbor in 1944. There he did various jobs around the island. He did not see combat and claims that he was part of an outfit that was going to be shipped to Iwo Jima, but was moved off of that group two weeks beforehand for unknown reasons. I think after the war ended he toured other places in the pacific before returning home. \n\nAt home he worked as an accountant for Ford and met his wife on some singles trip to meet people. He lived in Michigan his whole life. Has yet to see the lions win a Super Bowl.\n\nI\u2019ve asked a lot of other various questions about his opinion on events, historical figures, family history, but I don\u2019t know if there are some details that I should be asking on that I am unaware of because I\u2019m not a historian.

My window is about 8 or 10 feet off the ground in that spot. \n\nI talked to the super next door, who's door faces the guy's pile of stuff, and he said that he and the super of my building have tried to kick this guy out, gotten rid of his stuff, etc, but he keeps coming back. He was like \"I've tried [next to nothing] and I'm all out of ideas\". I get the feeling that he has stopped caring and simply tolerates the guy. \n\nNow, I asked this super how did the guy seem. He says he seems very nice, like a normal guy.\n\nI've observed that his piles of stuff are relatively tidy and he tries to cover them, and this morning I watched as he flossed and brushed his teeth, and he had his toiletries well arranged in ziplock bags. \n\nI don't feel threatened, though I did install some bars to prevent the window on the fire escape from being able to be opened. \n\nI don't wish this guy harm either, as he obviously is on hard times, and having the police do anything (if they even would), might make his life harder. \n\nMy building's super is about as absent and hands off as you can get, though he did threaten to physically harm someone else who was lurking around. \n\nI could start badgering the management to do something. \n\n\nTBH, I wouldn't really care about this guy's presence, especially as he seems to be taking pains to not be a nuisance, *except* for the face that he's directly beneath my window. Ie, he can probably hear me watch movies, engage in romance, etc. \n\nBeyond that, it's not been any issue. \n\nWhat would you do?",
        "human_comment": "You can ask your super to ask him to move to a new location. You can have homeless services do a wellness check on him. You can get a big ass plant and planter and place it there next time he moves his stuff. Or you can learn to live with it. \n\nWe had someone sleeping outside our front door for a few days, then one of our neighbors started offering help nonstop and they moved because they didnt like the attention.",
        "AI_comment": "I'd reach out to the building management and try to explain the situation.  Maybe they can work with the city or a social services agency to get him some help.  He's clearly struggling, and he's trying to make the best of a tough situation. \n"

It's often the case that there isn't a clear \"winner\" in philosophical debates, and the arguments can feel circular or inconclusive. This can be frustrating, but it's also a testament to the complexity of these issues. The fact that there's no easy answer to the problem of evil doesn't mean it's not worth thinking about, or that there's no value in engaging with different perspectives.  Perhaps seeing the lack of consensus as an opportunity for deeper exploration, rather than a frustrating impasse, might help. \n"

They are engaging and accessible, and they introduce you to some of the core concepts of Western philosophy.  However, I'd also recommend looking into Stoic philosophy.

        "content": "As far as I know, the majority of philosophers have abandoned the logical Problem of Evil in favor of the evidential one. This is because you can just respond to the logical problem by saying that God has reasons to allow evil in order to allow greater good that outweighs the evil. But is this really convincing? If God is omnipotent, then he can get the \"greater\" good without the evil. I often hear apologists argue that God is obviously omnipotent, but he can't do illogical things (like create a rock he can't lift), but in this case how would getting this greater good without evil be illogical? It's weird to me that such an exceptional argument would fall out of fashion for a seemingly non-issue.",
        "human_comment": "As long as there is any possible way for a universe created by an all good, all knowing, and all powerful being to contain evil, the logical argument fails.\n\nShowing that there is no possible way is a pretty big job. It makes more sense to use move to the inductive version.",
        "AI_comment": "I think the symmetry/parody argument is a good point. It really highlights the problem of trying to justify evil by appealing to a greater good. If the same logic can be used to justify evil, then it loses its persuasive power.  It seems like the evidential problem of evil is a much stronger argument because it forces the theist to actually provide evidence for their claims about God's reasons for allowing evil. \n"
