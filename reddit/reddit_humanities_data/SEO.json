Google told us that starting yesterday it will stop offering continuous scroll on desktop, with the mobile search interface to follow in the coming months.\n\nGoogle told us this was to make search faster and only load the results the searcher asked for.\n\nGoogle launched continuous scroll on desktop in December 2022, 1.5 years ago, and continuous scroll on mobile search in October 2021, 2.5 years ago. Since then Google has been testing bringing back the old pagination options where you click next and also the more results button and has now decided to do away with continuous scroll completely.\n\nGoogle told us this change enables them to serve faster results on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven\u2019t explicitly requested.\n\nSource: [https://www.seroundtable.com/google-continuous-scroll-dead-37618.html](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-continuous-scroll-dead-37618.html)\n\n\n\n",

Google says they ignore low quality links or if they find links might be manipulated, but I've seen many times sites losing traffic after building tons of low quality links. And if the links are suddenly removed at once, it can also reduce traffic. I won't explain why and how exactly, cz it's a black hat technique. \n\nAlso, sounds like you have a content only site? Then it's normal lately. Google is rewarding service websites over pure blog and affiliate sites as Google literally failed to fight spam blog sites."

Dr Isabella\u00a0Michalak, does not treat minors. And we dont treat minors without a parent consent form. We have not had any parent consent forms for a 11 year old in 2+ years.\u00a0\n\nFlagging these on Google doesnt do anything. What else can I do ? I will appreciate any help from the community.",

Cue the bad reviews from everyone who read that post. \n\nDid your clinic do something similar? If so, may be worth looking into your policies and offering sincere apologies. If not, maybe look into your clinic name on Facebook to see if there are any public posts accusing your clinic of doing something along those lines.",
