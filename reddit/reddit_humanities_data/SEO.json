Google told us that starting yesterday it will stop offering continuous scroll on desktop, with the mobile search interface to follow in the coming months.\n\nGoogle told us this was to make search faster and only load the results the searcher asked for.\n\nGoogle launched continuous scroll on desktop in December 2022, 1.5 years ago, and continuous scroll on mobile search in October 2021, 2.5 years ago. Since then Google has been testing bringing back the old pagination options where you click next and also the more results button and has now decided to do away with continuous scroll completely.\n\nGoogle told us this change enables them to serve faster results on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven\u2019t explicitly requested.\n\nSource: [https://www.seroundtable.com/google-continuous-scroll-dead-37618.html](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-continuous-scroll-dead-37618.html)\n\n\n\n",

This is causing an intense amount of distress.\n\nWe are a small dental clinic and we keep concise medical records, and we can provide documentation that these people were never in our clinic.\u00a0\n\nFor example there is a review\u00a0mentioning how someone \"took their sister's son to Dr\u00a0Michalak\". Dr Isabella\u00a0Michalak, does not treat minors. And we dont treat minors without a parent consent form. We have not had any parent consent forms for a 11 year old in 2+ years.\u00a0\n\nFlagging these on Google doesnt do anything. What else can I do ? I will appreciate any help from the community.",

Cue the bad reviews from everyone who read that post. \n\nDid your clinic do something similar? If so, may be worth looking into your policies and offering sincere apologies. If not, maybe look into your clinic name on Facebook to see if there are any public posts accusing your clinic of doing something along those lines.",

            ">Are there any SEO managers or experts here who use combinations of tools like SEMrush and Screaming Frog (excluding Google Analytics)?\n\nMy guess is, most SEOs use a combination of tools.\n\nA common combination is SEMrush or ahrefs (or one of the cheaper alternatives) for keyword research + Google Search Console + Screaming Frog for ad-hoc crawling + maybe a TF-IDF/LSI/Word2Vec writing tool like SurferSEO.",
            "Just a guess - if you are using multiple tools, you want to combine analysis. Dive into the export options of these tools and analyse the content they are delivering. Then decide what analysis / data points etc you want from that and use desktop excel with macros (or google sheets with macros if need be). \n\nExport the data from the different tools and have the macro automatically combine them each time you download them. This will allow you to create the same results with the press of a button and combine / enrich the data the way you want. \n\n  \nWhy this road? Each tool usually has their own analytics / data listings and works well within this. But good tools always have good exports which will allow you to recreate those (and then combine). \n\nIt usually looks daunting and will be problematic the first few times until you have the combination going.\n\nProblem #1 usually? Not really knowing what you want out of the data. Or be creative enough with the existing tools to get what you want out of them. hth.",
            "SEMRush, Ahrefs, Screaming Frog, these are my most favorite SEO tools. I use others too for specific purposes but these are my everyday tools. Just by mastering the SF, you can learn more technical SEO than most technical SEO specialists. It's so powerful yet not everyone leverages it. \n\n\nIf you want to learn SF in-depth, then start by reading their blogs."
