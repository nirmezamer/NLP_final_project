            "Context : the guy did a social experiment where he would add something to the drink of the woman (also an actor) and they would see the reactions of people. Like you can see, men would just watch and not act or say anything.\n\nIts not shown in the video but three women would act and say that the guy spiked her drink. Men love to call themselves protectors yet they sit there and do nothing. Women are our best allies.\n\n[the full video](https://youtu.be/ontgb2aaOMI?si=C_-J4wULHwgLxhzQ) (it is in french but its pretty udnerstandable on its own)",

            "I love bringing this up whenever anyone says this, but I heard that gynecologists referred to the enslaved women they experimented on as females to deny them personhood and then served white \u2018women\u2019. They did this both to justify their experimentation but also to make white women more comfortable that they weren\u2019t being equated to black enslaved women. Idk if that history has a direct relation to the modern usage of female by incels, but IMO it shows that using females instead of women has a history of dehumanizing / deriding women.",

Men have the same natural ability to look attractive that women do, but more women dedicate time, research, and effort into looking attractive while most men think all that\u2019s needed is a monthly haircut, shaving once your mustache gets in your mouth, and wearing clashing graphic t shirts with every single outfit"
