            "I heard that Jiri was spotted in a bohemian forest talking to a Baba Yaga. sources have not confirmed whether the wisp was benign or evil",
            "Clearing up some misconceptions about Alex Pereira \"shamanistic magic\": \n\nSo i don't know Poatan personally, but i do know that he is from the city of so bernardo do campo (which is where i live today), and that he descends from the Patax tribe in the state of Bahia, northeastern Brazil (which is the state where i was born). Now regarding Jiri's words about Alex use of \"shamans\" and \"magic\", which is probably related to his heritage, i think its interesting to point out some things. First of all, the Pataxs do not have \"shamans\", as this concept of \"curandeiro spiritual leader\" is mostly derived from amazonian tribes. Second of all, they also do not perform magic or \"voodoo\", which are words usually used in a pejorative way to refer to afro-latino religions. The only thing that the Pataxs might be known in regards to spiritual themes is their profound conection with its ancestors (which can be associated with divine worship, but it doesn't go deeper than the relationship between jewish people and holocaust victims, as you could argue that pretty much the same thing happened with the Pataxs in Bahia), so i would say that Jiri probably mixed some indigenous cultures together and made the assumption that Poatan could be in contact with his tribe's \"shaman\" before the fights in search of some spiritual help, which i find very fascinating but most definitely not true.",
            "Jiri taking alot of time hopefully he makes it the last thing the card needs is a title fight weight miss",
            "The goof said the UFC is spending 20 million on the sphere to make that event. None of us will obviously know, but what do you think in 5 years would have more value for the UFC's brand. Spending 20 million for that event, or doing a regular event, but having signed more high level talent that has been free agents over the last year that didn't want to take dwcs contracts of entry level deals?",
