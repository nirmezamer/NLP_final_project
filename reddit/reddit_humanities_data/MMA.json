            "Just watched Ikram's 2 ufc fights on youtube, not enough to really get a read on a guy, but things I saw:\n\n * He loses track of defense a bit when attacking: several times in both fights he gets countered hard when he throws\n   * Even when countered hard, Ikram continues his own offense, and looks more to turn it around than to play it safe\n        * This would surely be Rob's best chance to really hurt him, but if Rob got too eager, he could rock Rob right after being countered\n * He likes the front kick to gut, thigh kick, only saw like 1 calf kick\n * Saw 1 check of a leg kick from him, but those guys weren't attacking it the way Rob does\n   * Given he had 1 in such short fights, he may be able to check the kicks better than Costa did once he gets a read on it\n * Ikram's attacks are balanced (mixes punches, kicks of varying types), and he likes to fight from closer range than Rob\n\nGiven Ikram was training for a 3R fight, and what looks to me to be a fairly aggressive game, I won't be surprised if he fights this to get or get got, and both guys could be in danger in an extended exchange.",

He went into his last fight with Dustin with a stress fracture in his shin which he really shouldn't have been fighting with and he literally snapped his leg in half and it could have been amputated if it wasn't operated on as quickly as it was.",

He chose to say toe so quite frankly he deserves the shit he's getting for it - I know an injury is an injury and we'd rather not expect fighters to go out there injured but is this why they called off the press conference? Nah, fuck that, big doubt."
