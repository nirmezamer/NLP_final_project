        "content": "I, 22F have a best friend 22F who introduced our now guy best friend 19M about 2 years ago. We are a cute little trio and we\u2019re best friends, the only hiccup was my best friend and guy best friend briefly dated for about a month. They ended peacefully and nothing changed between us. \n\nRecently, my best friend and I noticed a change in his behavior. Ever since we briefly shared a bed to take a nap (nothing sexual just nap) I noticed he got slowly more touchy with us. There was never any awkwardness between us or tenstion, so him being more touchy with me and my bff is a little strange. \n\nWe recently went on a camping trip just the three of us, nothing crazy happened but we did share a tent and an air mattress however we all had our own sleeping bags. On the second night of the trip, he was super touchy and fell asleep hugging my bare legs. Again, not too alarming but still. He doesn\u2019t make disrespectful comments or make us uncomfortable but the vibes are different now. \n\nToday we had a pool day with my bffs little sister. He was super touchy and playful all day but my bestie and I thought it was normal pool-play behavior. Except, he was constantly throwing us around, hugging us from behind, pooling my hair, and even grabbing our legs and bringing our bodies closer to his. Nothing too crazy until her little sister left for the night. We were in the hot tub and he was getting very cozy with my best friend, having her massage him and resting between our legs. Again, my bestie and I aren\u2019t normally affectionate people so maybe it\u2019s normal? I don\u2019t want to seem naive but we\u2019re just confused. \n\nTo sum it up these were the concerning parts: he pulled my hair, kept grabbing our waists and pulling us to his body, staring at our racks, he whispered in my ear from behind, got his face very close to my bestie, and even left marks on my body from where he was pulling me around. All this plus constantly hugging us, etc. There was very clear tension in the air and I tried multiple times to lighten the mood by cracking jokes, changing the music etc. we\u2019re not uncomfortable, just confused. Any thoughts? Are we crazy?? Someone tell us. ",

            "Outside guy perspective, I'd probably guess if this isn't how things were for a while and he started getting more touchy with both of you.. he either got comfortable enough with you 2 and thats.. maybe how he displays affection..? Or he is infatuated and is hoping for it to progress. I'd guess he's hoping for more and does wanna sleep with you guys but you won't really know until something crazier happens or you flat out ask him yourselves.\n\nEdit: overall, it seems like he's gotten extremely more touchy and not just in a 'more frequent hugging' or few extra shoulder taps kinda way so I feel like there's more to this than simply being more touchy, just because.",

I didn't care much about that but I was a bit concerned that maybe me sitting on it was painful.  I didn't end up asking him though, since we had friends around and I was pretty comfy.

They refinanced at a higher mortgage (I.e 20 years ago, they took a new mortgage of 55k but they pocketed 10k for home remodels, life events , whatever).  Then 10 years after that, they do the same thing so they\u2019re always taking money/appreciated house value from the house instead of paying down the mortgage until it\u2019s fully paid off   \n\nI only know because my folks did the same thing, but with higher numbers unfortunately.",
            "When people refinance their homes they often roll high-interest debt into the principal as it is an easy way to reduce interest costs. I have done it myself. Bought for 182K and still over 125K after 18 Years. With home values going up constantly the amount I can put on the home has increased significantly.  My loan should be under 60K now but we have rolled more than 30k a few times into the mortgage. Funds covered high car loans, renos, and some credit card debt. Still will be paid off in about 10 years though so overall only added 3 years to the amortization but I also overpay on biweekly payments. I probably should have been able to pay it off a few years early in retrospect but high interest is more damaging to cash flow than the mortgage so it meant a better quality of life for me and my family.",

So many fees associated with this and not really a fun process.  But if its your only means of getting needed cash you do what you have to do.",
