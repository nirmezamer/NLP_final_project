No personal insults.**\n\nYou're free to disagree on who is in the right, who is in the wrong, what's a human rights abuse, what's a proportional response etc. Avoid stuff like \"x country should be genocided\" or insulting other users because they disagree with you.\n\nThe other sidebar rules still apply, as well.",

            "What should Israel actually do?  All I hear is \"Israel is committing genocide\".  So, you're Israel.  Hamas' specific goal is to kill all Jewish people and completely destroy you.  And they hide in the  civilian population.  Then they actively plot to kill you, but are hidden in their civilian population.  What is your solution?",
            "I've seen a lot of deserved criticism around Israel's treatment of Palestinians, but why does no one discuss Hamas's treatment of Palestinians?\n\nIsrael are bombing civilian areas because Hamas are hiding in civilian areas. Israel are bombing aid trucks because Hamas are smuggling weapons in aid trucks. The war is ongoing because Hamas started and continue to consent to the most recent war.\n\nYou can say that this doesn't justify Israel's actions, but 1. it complicates them legally at the very least, and 2. the fact remains the behaviour of the two arr inextricably linked. If you wanna ask why a civilian was bombed, \"there was a Hamas leader right next to them who organised crimes against humanity on Oct 7th and poses a continued threat to Israel's national security\" is pretty CRUCIAL context.\n\nI don't want to tolerate what Israel are doing. I don't want what's happening to ever be okay. Regardless of anything, they are at least 50% at fault which is deplorable in its own right. But this feels like a huge elephant in the room which everyone refuses to acknowledge is there. I don't understand how I can trust activists and a movement, if they choose to ignore reality by acting as if Israel are just targeting civilians for fun/cruelty.",

The US state department currently defines antisemitism as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews.\" I see many college kids today protesting Israeli actions in Gaza and then being labeled as antisemitic. It seems to be that one should be free to criticize a government separately from a race of people, but maybe I'm missing something?",

It shows that you care a lot for your wife's feelings and have a great deal consideration for her. \n\nSometimes it's a good idea to reflect on what you could have done differently. Trying to problem solve in the moment may have made the day better. Some solutions I can think of are:\n\n- Focus doing other things instead of rides, such as playing games, seeing if there are any shows, dining, etc.\n- Go to a gift shop. They may have a lot of items there that may help. I would've purchased a t-shirt with sleeves that are long enough to conceal her underarm. They may even have toiletries, like razors, that could help. \n- If you're not too far from home, ask if she'd like to head home to address her concern.\n\nWhen you're in the moment, try to think short term and say to yourself, \"What can I do *now* to make this situation better.\" They don't need to be permanent long term solution, but things that you can do in the moment to get through the day."

She wanted it fiesta themed so that\u2019s what I did. I covered the room in brightly colored fans, ceiling toppers, banners, and table wear. I worked with some of my Spanish coworkers to find a decent playlist on Spotify to fit the fiesta vibe, brought maracas and sombreros, and we let our workers wear the sombreros on the clock. My manager had asked me to buy sombrero coolers and a cactus wearing sunglasses and a sombrero as well. I didn\u2019t think ANYTHING of it. Just thought it was cute decor and wanted to bring the joy and camaraderie of Latin culture to our store. Our workers loved it! They danced and wore the sombreros and told customers all about it, posted it on social media and everything. I was so excited and proud of my work. However, one of our workers came in and was very visibly upset by the whole display. They kept quiet and to themselves for most the day, and then asked to speak to me in private. I went with them and we talked for around 20 minutes. The associate asked me to talk to them privately and said that there should not have been sombreros and Latin music. They were extremely offended and said there was nothing that related a taco party to sombreros or Latin culture at all. They said if they want a taco, they\u2019ll go to Taco Bell. Not any Latin specific place. They said a couple other people agreed, and that some others called it racist. They said if they were to put it up on social media it would go viral. They said it was nothing against me and that I\u2019m really nice and do hard work, but they just were very offended by the sombreros, music, some decor, and the cactus in particular as well. They ragged on some of our Spanish coworkers, saying they weren\u2019t born in Latin America so they like me didn\u2019t understand how awful it was. I told them I would talk to our store manager and keep it between us because I understood it didn\u2019t need to turn into any drama but I don\u2019t want to do anything offensive in the future. They agreed and we left it at that. But then I was told by other associates that he was telling the whole store, talked to a bunch of managers, and was letting everyone know. I just want someone to tell me point blank should I have known better? Did I do something wrong? I feel terrible.
