            "September 21st over here. I just went in for my second fitting for my wedding dress and they did nothing to it. I bought my dress last June 2023, they had to order it and said that it would take 8 to 10 months. Well, at the 9 month mark I called to check on progress. They had it in but didn't call me. We go in for an initial fitting. Few minor alterations were needed but mostly it needed hemming. (I'm 5'0 lol). They took my measurements and said they would alter it. I asked when It should be done and if they would call me. I was told that they would call in about 2 weeks. 3 weeks go by and nothing. I call and they said we could come in for another fitting. We go in this morning and none of the alterations were done. Now I have to find a new seamstress \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f because no way was I dealing with them again.\u00a0",

            "Old people don\u2019t know how to do that. We are sending out invites just for them and the rest codes.",
            "I did this once a few years ago. I was so young and had never been to a wedding without my parents haha. I literally didn\u2019t know we needed to rsvp for some reason. Now that I am planning my own wedding, I cringe so hard at that memory. Just know that most people don\u2019t mean to not rsvp probably, it\u2019s an oversight.",
            "It\u2019s a bit annoying, but to offer a different perspective wedding websites are pretty recent and not a traditional way of RSVPing. One of my relatives had literally never seen one before and told my mom. I\u2019d just send them the link directly and ask them to RSVP there.",

Only 10-15 filled it in \ud83d\ude44 sigh I'm glad my wedding is still a year away but it's really annoying setting up this neat online RSVP knowing I'll probably have to manually contact each of these people anyway in the end coz they won't do it.",
            "Most people don't have occasion to go to fancy parties that require formal RSVPs. They don't really understand what RSVPs are unless they've thrown a fancy wedding. It's not malicious, they just really have no idea how it works or why it's important.",
            "I\u2019m literally preparing for the shitshow that will be people RSVPing through our website. Especially since we chose to have a password, which is written on the invitation, which will be overlooked and thus no RSVP provided. \n\nThankfully 90% of our guests are my fianc\u00e9s family and any questions will be directed to him because thankfully no one has my number! I refused to shell out even more money on paper RSVPS when those would also get lost anyways."

        "content": "First, I am so grateful for this subreddit. I read so many posts about what to expect and received so much good advice, I hope to give back with my own experiences. I had a large wedding in a city.\n\nPlanner: If you can, getting a planner makes your life so much easier. She was the most helpful resource for my questions and constantly anticipated exactly what we needed. On the day of my wedding, she took care of everything. I did not have a watch and just went where she told me and did all of the fun things all day and night long!\n\nYou and your fiance: Communication is key. I planned a lot of the wedding and realized I am not the best communicator. I had him sit in the meetings with the photographer and DJ. The first so he knew what to expect of the day since he (like me) doesn\u2019t like taking a lot of photos and could add his thoughts. The second because music is so important to him. This leads to my next point.\n\nKnow yourselves: What is important to you two? I knew from the beginning I wanted 30min between the ceremony and reception where we could relax and just be married before jumping back into the whirlwind. It was so nice! I always liked the advice, write down 3 things that matter to you most and focus on them. Make sure your fiance does to, and discuss!\n\nThe week before the wedding (emotions): I was so stressed out about last minute things that I could not get excited about my wedding. I felt empty and guilty I felt this way. People constantly asking me how planning was going and if I was excited didn\u2019t help. The week leading up to the wedding had some low lows and was also the most intense love I had ever felt for my fiance as he helped me through it. Finally, I let go of everything and actually found joy again as I started to see my friends at the rehearsal.\n\nMindfulness: Everyone kept telling us the day was going to fly so we decided together to be mindful throughout the day. We would literally say \u201cwe are sitting in this car on the way to the reception\u201d and then enjoy the moment. I think this and having a planner take care of logistics made this day feel long and special. \n\nBridesmaids getting ready: I made a kit that had bandaids for painful heels, scissors in case the dresses had extra straps etc, and cheap pearl hair pins that were optional. I also brought colored straws so girls knew which drinks were theirs.\n\nLittle things I would keep the same: Feet numbing spray for heels before the ceremony, wedding reception white sequin sneakers, coffee stand at the reception, a special outro song to end the night\n\nMost importantly: And this matters more than upgraded silverware or salad choice, you are marrying a wonderful person!! Many congratulations to you both :) Best of luck with planning!",
