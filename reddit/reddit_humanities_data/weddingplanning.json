            "September 21st over here. I just went in for my second fitting for my wedding dress and they did nothing to it. I bought my dress last June 2023, they had to order it and said that it would take 8 to 10 months. Well, at the 9 month mark I called to check on progress. They had it in but didn't call me. We go in for an initial fitting. Few minor alterations were needed but mostly it needed hemming. (I'm 5'0 lol). They took my measurements and said they would alter it. I asked when It should be done and if they would call me. I was told that they would call in about 2 weeks. 3 weeks go by and nothing. I call and they said we could come in for another fitting. We go in this morning and none of the alterations were done. Now I have to find a new seamstress \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f because no way was I dealing with them again.\u00a0",

            "People are clueless about the RSVP process for the same reason why people ask questions on Reddit or Facebook that have answers that would show up as the first result in a google search. And for the same reason why I am frequently answering professional questions with, \"Have you read the instructions for the form?\" Because the answer is in the instructions.\n\nBasically, people don't read and want someone to spoon-feed them everything. It's a human nature thing, not specific to RSVPs.\n\nIt's annoying AF though.",
            "We had a lot of people who viewed not RSVPing at all as the equivalent of a \"not attending\" response. I think because with evites for birthday parties and such, that's basically how most people do it. Respond yes, or ignore the email. They don't realize that with wedding planning, we need those numbers to be accurate.\n\nMy mom in her seventies figured out how to RSVP online; she complained, but still did it all by herself!\n\nWe had some young adults, where it was their first time attending a wedding, who needed some coaching on what to do. I didn't mind those.\n\nI had a guest, who absolutely knew better, send me a \"yeah, I'll be there\" text, and then a week before the wedding wanted to know if she could bring a plus one...there was a plus one for her if she had RSVP'd properly, but by then we had already turned in catering numbers. That one I was less sympathetic towards!",
            "I feel this so hard \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 my cousin\u2019s rsvp showed up after the wedding",
            "I did this once a few years ago. I was so young and had never been to a wedding without my parents haha. I literally didn\u2019t know we needed to rsvp for some reason. Now that I am planning my own wedding, I cringe so hard at that memory. Just know that most people don\u2019t mean to not rsvp probably, it\u2019s an oversight.",
            "Old people don\u2019t know how to do that. We are sending out invites just for them and the rest codes.",
            "From what I\u2019ve seen:\n\n1. People don\u2019t read through the entire invite, so they never see the website. I\u2019m the type to usually read everything, and even then I used to only look at the time and place. I remember going to my friend\u2019s wedding and we had like 30-40 people hanging out the day beforehand and asking the couple a ton of logistical questions. They joked about how they never should have bothered with the website and literally everyone was like, \u201cthere was a website??\u201d I started looking for it after that.\n\n2. They\u2019re not used to it. Most people don\u2019t go to events where they need to formally RSVP to stuff. If they\u2019re younger and haven\u2019t been to many weddings before, they might not realize the importance until they plan their own. If they\u2019re older, they might not know you can do it online.\n\n3. If people constantly go to weddings where the bride and groom are nice enough to send a text to those that didn\u2019t RSVP to confirm attendance, they\u2019ll just never realize. The same bride and groom above had texted every single guest and so have a lot of other couples that I know.",
            "A lot of our closer guests were clueless about RSVPing. I had to tell my sister and my future in-laws that yes they actually do need to RSVP even though yes I do know that they're coming. You still need to pick your meal on our website!",
            "I\u2019m literally preparing for the shitshow that will be people RSVPing through our website. Especially since we chose to have a password, which is written on the invitation, which will be overlooked and thus no RSVP provided. \n\nThankfully 90% of our guests are my fianc\u00e9s family and any questions will be directed to him because thankfully no one has my number! I refused to shell out even more money on paper RSVPS when those would also get lost anyways.",
            "It\u2019s a bit annoying, but to offer a different perspective wedding websites are pretty recent and not a traditional way of RSVPing. One of my relatives had literally never seen one before and told my mom. I\u2019d just send them the link directly and ask them to RSVP there.",
            "YES. also because we need to be 100% sure if any guest has a food allergy that catering needs to be aware of. let alone meal choice. cmon man \ud83d\ude29\n\n\nI feel like my personal rsvp time for other peoples weddings has always been within 2 weeks of receiving the invitation. and i have adhd. i forget everything. i leave my phone in the fridge sometimes!! i don\u2019t get it!!"
