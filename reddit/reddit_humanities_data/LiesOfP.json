            "Hi! I'm someone who has played Sekiro and a bit of Bloodborne (I don't own a PS so I could only play a bit on my friend's PS). Is this game similar to them? And how is the difficulty when compared to them?",
            "I think something I'm learning more through threads like this are:\n\n-every GOOD Soulsborne/Soulslike has their own dance and rhythm\n\n-just because you're good at one doesn't mean you'll immediately be good at another, but it will likely make it easier to learn the new one\n\nEx: A dancer who excels at the salsa will still have difficulty learning hip-hop even tho they're a professional/veteran of dancing because they may rely on their knowledge and experience of a different style and have to unlearn the old to learn the new.\n\nLikewise a beginner will have difficulty because they're starting from square one and are learning new concepts instead of adapting what they know (like the dancer).\n\nEach game is its own dance and we're all just learning as we go.\n\nThat being said, I wish the parry window was slightly longer but otherwise it's fun and hasn't been *terribly* hard until I got to the Mad Clown Puppet (and I've only played DSR and DS3 for reference).",
            "Let me ensure you newcomers that this game is not only doable but also 100% achievable. I am like, the LEAST technical, least accurate, most panicky player in the world. My parry game is shaky at best and I roll around like a jumping bean on a hot pan. \n\nWith my patented \"Panic\" style (wear I basically throw things, puppet string, and slash and smash before running like a damned fool), I was still able to break through the first playthrough. \n\nAnd I didn't use the Specter for EVERY boss. I did the Black Rabbit Brother solo and used him to learn perfect parry windows and weapon breaking. I did Victor solo and used him to learn about weaknesses to throwables and Puppet String timing, and the final boss solo which was pretty damn rough but I did it! \n\n(Not including all the mini bosses that specters cannot be used on, of course).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mostly used the Salamander Dagger and acidic spear my first playthrough also - I made the fatal mistake of using Boss Ergo for the first 3 bosses before realizing it gave me items.\n\nI am currently on NG ++ and tearing through the game on my way to my final 3 achievements. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is my advice to you, the new guy and gal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is no \"Proper\" way to play. So use throwables, use specters, grind for levels to get yourself \"overpowered\". Dodge instead of parry. Parry instead of dodge. Run around like a damn idiot like I do and hope for the best. Just never give up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Puppet Strings & Aegis are the Legion Arms you may want to lvl up for your first playthrough. The Lvl 3 puppet string is fantastic for staggering and ripping apart enemies and bosses (make sure you time it right). I will explain Aegis in my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aegis Shield - I NEVER understood how this worked until I watched someone use it. You can HOLD the shield in front of you and attack while still blocking. A 1-handed weapon is the most effective way to do this. I had NO CLUE that the shield did this - I thought it was a perfect parry shield that exploded so I never used it until my 2nd time against the final boss. Now it's one of my favorite survival tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Experiment with your weapons! You can swap heads and handles around endlessly. So experiment with what handles work well and what heads work well. Read the Fable Arts to understand bonuses. Some Handles give a huge Perfect Parry window that really help out and they are dirt cheap. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Don't be afraid to stock up on supplies. I may forego levels in order to stock up on a huge supply of throwables. They come in handy esp when you have to balance on a ledge with enemies nearby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Throwing Balls are VERY useful. Not only do the INSTANT KNOCK DOWN enemies who are flashing white, but they can interrupt attacks, stagger enemies, and even build stagger meters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Don't ever be afraid to look up maps or whatnot. Seriously - sometimes it gets very easy to get lost or miss important items such as Supply Crates, NPCs, and Quartz. There is an amazingly detailed map in the Steam discussions that really helps out. \n\nFinally - have fun!! :D You got this!",
            "I just finished this game. I'm a souls game veteran and initially I had my doubts about this game after reading the reviews regarding the difficulty and combat. Regardless, I decided to give it a try and... boy, I'm SO glad I did. This game is truly incredible. It gave me the exact same feeling I constantly chase when playing souls game... the addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back for more. This is the best video game I have played that is not Fromsoftware. \n\nIn the beginning combat may seem a little off (especially coming from Fromsoftware games). But just like in Sekiro... there is that one moment where the gameplay just clicks and syncs in your mind, and once that happens... its over, you are fully hooked and you just can't get enough. \n\nTo anyone thinking about playing this game.... YES YES YES. Trust me, you'll thank me later.",
            "I've plat/100% every souls game and Lies of P, I played all of them in the last 3 years. In terms of bosses, it's more or less like Dark Souls but not as difficult as ER, Bloodborne and Sekiro. In terms of levels outside of boss fights, it's one of the easiest.",
            "Comparing this to difficulty of souls games I\u2019ve played.\u00a0\n\nHARDEST\u00a0\n\nSekiro (by a fucking country mile - to the point I don\u2019t enjoy it)\n\n\u00a0Elden Ring\u00a0\n\nDark Souls 3\u00a0\n\nBloodborne\u00a0\n\nLies of P\u00a0\n\nDark Souls 1\u00a0\n\nEASIEST\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Laxasia, Green Monster, and Nameless are rough. Other than that (post nerf) no one is horrifically hard. The levels are pretty easy besides the Victor museum place and Arche Abbey.",
            "Step 1 Download game\n\nStep 2 Uninstall after dying to Fuoco 40 times (punch chair arm really hard)\n\nStep 3 Redownload 20 minutes later and proceed to clear the rest of the game over the next two days\n\nStep 4 Bliss",
            "I think that Lies of P has very reasonable difficulty. Boss attacks are very well telegraphed, and it's possible to dodge them when first seeing them. Getting perfect guard timings down takes practice, but it's not necessary to get tons of perfect guards to beat bosses. The game provides plenty of options for contending with difficult bosses. You can utilize Legion Arms, throwables, Grindstones, and status effects. And there are plenty of different viable weapons to utilize. Also, the P-Organ system provides plenty of build options - players can select what enhancements best suit their playstyle. \n\nIf you're having difficulty with a boss, what'd I recommend is to play evasively at first and watch the bosses' patterns. After you determine good windows to deal damage to the bosses, play more aggressively. Get the timing of Perfect Guards down for a couple of attacks with longer telegraphs - the timing aren't actually that strict. I've found that fast weapons make it very easy to deal damage reliably. \n\nOf course, the game is still very difficult and it's not for everyone.",
            "Honestly, I played it and thought it was hard. \n\nI am now playing Dark Souls again...Dark Souls is twice as hard... IMO",
            "it's easy if you adapt to the tools the game gives you, it's hard if you're stubborn and only use the mechanics that you personally like. i did my first playthrough with no spectres, no consumables, i didn't really make use of the weapon combinations system, and i didn't dodge very often (opting for 90% parrying), and found it to be the most difficult soulslike i've played (also the most fun). \n\ni like that this game gives you so many outs to make the game easier, but i kinda think that people who use all of them need to stop talking about how easy the game is (likewise people who DONT use them need to stop talking about how hard the game is). if you're not willing to use the tools the game gives you to customize your difficulty experience, then why say anything at all."

            "This dude has never ever played a soulslike in their entire life and it's very clear because that complaint about saving it's crazy because that doesn't exist in any fromsoft game.\n\nAlso the stargazers complaint, again, shows the lack of never playing a soulsborne in their entire life because you have PLENTY of stargazers everywhere and about 2-3 hours into the game you MANDATORY obtain an item that teleports you back to the hotel for free.\n\nAlso you don't have to retrace your steps like at all (which IMO is one of the weakest points in the game. After the corruption in krat station, I purposefully went back and retraced all my steps to see if things changed or there's something new and no, the game is as linear as you can think)",

I upgraded it to max lvl 5, then punished him with the heavy charge attack any time there was an opening (it\u2019s fast).\n\nFor P-organ skills, pretty much everything with stagger I upgraded and comes in handy with him. You should also learn his attack patterns and parry him. The rush attack in his second phase will open him up big time when you do.",

            "Parry timing. First phase is more so about figuring out when to parry and attack. After a certain amount of parries, he gets stunned, and you can wail on him. \n\nPhase 2 is where it can be trickier since he's faster and can attack from a longer distance. Either dodge or time a parry. One other strategy you can use, is the mjolnir handle that allows you to withstand a hit from him without getting stance broken. If you're not confident in your timing, use that skill. I did that for my first playthrough and it SAVED my ass and it allowed me to get in one last shot to win. \n\nGood luck out there!",

            "Man, I know people obviously have problems with him, but I just don\u2019t get why. He\u2019s aggressive, but the attack animations and timings are really intuitive. \n\nI guess the way I beat him (twice) was with Azure Dragon Crescent Glaive, some Fable Catalysts, and the Conquering Amulet.\n\nParry, get your hits in, and when your fable is full, parry and then immediately hit him with the dragon glaive weapon skill. It did like 3000 damage with 30ish technique using it with the Conquerer Amulet\u2019s buff. If you want to dish out some punishment, create some space, and pop some catalysts."
