            "Hi! I'm someone who has played Sekiro and a bit of Bloodborne (I don't own a PS so I could only play a bit on my friend's PS). Is this game similar to them? And how is the difficulty when compared to them?",
            "I've plat/100% every souls game and Lies of P, I played all of them in the last 3 years. In terms of bosses, it's more or less like Dark Souls but not as difficult as ER, Bloodborne and Sekiro. In terms of levels outside of boss fights, it's one of the easiest.",
            "Honestly, I played it and thought it was hard. \n\nI am now playing Dark Souls again...Dark Souls is twice as hard... IMO",
            "it's easy if you adapt to the tools the game gives you, it's hard if you're stubborn and only use the mechanics that you personally like. i did my first playthrough with no spectres, no consumables, i didn't really make use of the weapon combinations system, and i didn't dodge very often (opting for 90% parrying), and found it to be the most difficult soulslike i've played (also the most fun). \n\ni like that this game gives you so many outs to make the game easier, but i kinda think that people who use all of them need to stop talking about how easy the game is (likewise people who DONT use them need to stop talking about how hard the game is). if you're not willing to use the tools the game gives you to customize your difficulty experience, then why say anything at all.",
            "I think this game is much easier than Sekiro, but harder than Bloodborne. Easier than Sekiro because guard regain + more healing means you can make more mistakes. Harder than Bloodborne because guard regain isn't as reliable as rally, and you also need to alternate between several defensive options.",
            "Anyone else play this game by dodging 90% of the time and almost never actually doing perfect blocks?  \nWhy perfect block when you can just be in another spot, right? (I know this is not 100% right as some attacks will teach you), but hey... I just wanted to know if anyone else played like this. Obviously with a long reach weapon or something that closes the gap after you form it with a dodge.",
            "The problem is the \"snap\" attacks. The majority of attacks are not react-able. You have to memorize them. If you try to react to them, you're going to get hit. There simply isn't enough time to react to them. That isn't a good approach to difficulty. That doesn't respect players' time. You HAVE to see a boss 2-3 times to begin to understand how to block or dodge them. It's borderline unfair.",
            "The difficulty of bosses is perfect. On NG+, however, the common enemies can kill you in 2-3 swipes. They hit like bosses. I am on part 8 of NG+ and haven't struggled on any bosses, but I've died dozens of times to common grunts. Maybe tone down common grunt damage a little, or boost boss damage (some not all). A no-leg puppet should not hit with equal damage than Champion Victor, for example.",
            "lies of P was hard for me.  i was only able to beat 2 bosses without the spectre on NG++",
            "I feel like this game is hard till you learn it. But after playing Elden ring again its definetely easier. Being able to parry everything is a huge thing that opens up the game once you get it. Other souls games just are slower and a bit clunkier so deaths out of my control tended to happen more"

I upgraded it to max lvl 5, then punished him with the heavy charge attack any time there was an opening (its fast).\n\nFor P-organ skills, pretty much everything with stagger I upgraded and comes in handy with him. You should also learn his attack patterns and parry him. The rush attack in his second phase will open him up big time when you do.",
