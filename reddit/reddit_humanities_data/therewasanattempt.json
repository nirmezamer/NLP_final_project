As in, there is no racial classification and using the term brown as a racial classification is of itself racist. Shaming me for addressing and acknowledging that the alleged pedophile is a brown person. Such Shapiro-Owens logic is performative at best and anti-antiracist at its worst. \n\nLet\u2019s briefly handhold you through this shall we by flipping the script.
