Do not reply to another post. Do not reply to a cross-post. Do not reply more than once, including with alts. If you can't figure it out, we can't help you.\n\n## Selection process/rules\n1. One entry per person. Using alt accounts will result in a ban. New accounts are not eligible.\n2. Thread is open through **Friday, June 28th 11:59 PM UTC**. We'll let you figure out when that is in your own time zones.\n3. We will create an export of all unique eligible users who have a top level comment (that is, replied to the post, and not to another commenter). Commenting more than once will not help you and may annoy us. Breaking the rules in your comment reply will get it removed and get you possibly banned.\n4. From that export, we will grab the top 10 most upvoted people. We will contact each of those 10 via PM on Either Saturday, June 29th or Sunday June 30th.\n\t1. In the case of a 2-way tie resulting in more than 10 selected responses, both responses will be selected.\n\t2. In the case of a 3-way (or higher) tie resulting in more than 10 selected responses, the winner will be chosen by submission time (the person to have submitted their comment first will be chosen).\n5. Winners will have **48 hours** to provide us their details for the account they'd like to redeem their winnings on.\n6. Any person who does not reply in time loses their spot and everyone moves up a tier. For example the 3rd place person does not respond, so the 4th place person gets their prize, and the person 5th on the list moves up to 4.\n7. We will give the list to Uptime Robot, and they will provide you with your winnings directly.\n8. We reserve the right to edit this post including this process and these rules without notice. This is Reddit, after all.\n9. The giveaway is open for anyone to enter.",
