            "Oh absolutely but the tricky part is figuring out your hit rate, figuring out how much liquidity the trade can carry, identifying where it's going to go wrong. Most of the shorter term alpha trades have an expiration date. Like the inefficiencies are there until enough people notice them. For example some of the classic examples of how money was made easily during the Jesse Livermore day or even in the '90s, some of those methods that no longer work, the turtles. They worked for awhile \n\nFast forward to today. Here's what's so supremely difficult about becoming a good trader. You can look on social media or YouTube or anywhere and get great advice on video games. You can figure out how to get the best stuff. How to do really well. You can learn all of it. You want to learn about chainsaws you want to learn about cars you want to learn about homes. You can get great information \n\nWhen it comes to trading, there's none. Zero. There are occasionally channels or shows or people who make comments that can be relevant but they are slivers of information in the grand scheme. It's up to you to figure out a strategy that actually works. I guess the best way to say it is it's like going into a video game with no instruction book, no YouTube, no one to help you out. Talk about being an 8-year-old in the '80s. All these data points. You can look at them, if you're good you can even write programs to analyze them and come up with hit rates. People are looking at thousands of data points every day trying to figure out if there's an edge in some of them. I've done it. I found a few different methods that have worked for various lengths of time but they all expire or they shift. I'm not doing the same thing today that I was in 2017. \n\nIt's going to take years for people to really figure out how to make AI the most effective, maybe it won't take that long I mean I guess I can't say but right now even if you put in all of the data points. They have to be done in a way that is useful. Hit rates, percentages, probabilities. It's a constantly evolving art and it's one that the smartest people win at. One of the best public examples is probably the medallion fund. They did it, it works and they even did it on a fairly large scale. If you're talking small accounts like less than a half a million. There are a couple edges that I'm aware of that still work pretty well. There are probably more that I don't know about and that's the fun of this"

If you need to uber for 15 minutes to the port, then wait for the helicopter for 20 minutes, then fly for 12 minutes, then uber for 12 minutes again, it becomes a lot less attractive than actually flying point to point. You definitely won't save any money, and you might not even save any time, so it's not clear that this service will become profitable.
