QQQM only makes sense if your investing philosophy is \"US large cap stocks will do well in the future, but mostly only the ones on the NASDAQ that aren't financial companies.\"\n\nFor example, do you think Pepsi will significantly outperform Coke? Pepsi is in QQQM but not Coke because Pepsi trades on the NASDAQ and Coke trades on the NYSE. If you think both will do well then you would be better off owning both to reduce your uncompensated risk."
