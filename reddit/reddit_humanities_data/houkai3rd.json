            "GLB 88\n\nAbout Thelema Sena Lantern team. How does summoning them during stellar outburst work? Does it not matter when and how you summon so long as you keep up the buff that doubles the point gain? Or maybe you're supposed to prioritize summoning whoever does more damage out of the two? Or just summon both as soon as possible?",
            "When Thelema was released, I had a hard time using her. Until I learned that the simpliest strongest rotation for her is: ground: 3x basic atk > weapon atk > hold weapon atk. Or simply ground: 3x basic atk > weapon atk.\n\nMy question right now is about Lantern, I don't know if I'm doing it right? When non-AR, I simply spam basic atk, and then use weapon whenever it's available. Whenever the bar is full, I use hold atk. Whenever the ult is available, I use it. And then during AR, I ignore weapon button. I just simply spam basic atk, use hold basic atk when the bar is full and ult when possible. Idk if this is the right way to use her? It's too simple that I feel like I'm doing it wrong.",

            "GLB 88\n\nHow crucial is Chrono Navi\u2019s stigs? Subbing with Turgenev/Aslang for now. I have her weapon. \n\nHoTruth fully geared. All the fire DPS fully geared except for FoV. I do not have the FoV valk. Not pulling for Lantern.",

            "So how do you know whether characters from part 2 fit together in a team? It seems we are not really doing the simple \"DPS + 2 supports of the same element\" thing anymore."
