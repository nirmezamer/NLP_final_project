        "content": "Another 6 month since the last Megathread.\n\n[Link to the last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/lrn0gx/quick_question_megathread/)\n\n**Make sure to include the game(DOS, DOS EE, DOS2, DOS2 DE) in your question and mark your spoilers**\n\nThe FAQ for DOS2 will be built as we go along:\n\n>My game has a problem/doesn't work properly, what do I do?\n\nCheck [this](https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/6/3223871682609294995/) out. If you can't find a solution there contact Larian support as detailed.\n\n>Do I need to play the previous game to understand the story?\n\nNo, there is a timegap of 1000 years between DOS and DOS2. The overall timeline of the Divinity games in perspective to DOS2 looks like this: DOS2 is set 1222 years after DOS1, 24 years after Divine Divinity, 4 years after Beyond Divinity, and 58 years before Divinity 2.\n\n>How many people can play at once?\n\n* Up to 4 Players in the campaign and up to 4 players and a gamemaster in Gamemaster Mode.\n\n>Do I need to buy the game to play with my friends.\n\n* That depends on how you will play. Up to 2 Players can play on the same PC for a \"couch coop\" experience. This means you can have 4 player sessions with 2 copies of the game when using this method. If you don't play on the same PC each player is going to require his/her own copy.\n\n>Can I mix and match inputs for PC couch coop?\n\n* You can't use keyboard and mouse for couch coop, however you can mix controllers.\n\n>What's the deal with origin stories?\n\n* A custom character has no ties in the world whatsoever, nobody knows you. Origin characters on the other hand do have ties in the gameworld, that means people can recognise you and might interact differently with an origin character because of that characters reputation or because the characters have met before. Furthermore origin characters have their own questlines that run alongside the main story.\n\n>I don't like my build! Can I change it?\n\n* Yes! Once you leave the first island you get access to infinite respecs, with the second gift bag you can even get a respec mirror on the first island.\n\n>What are the new crafting recipes from the gift bag?\n\n* [List](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137514488)",

            "DOS2 DE PC: My party is using the gift bag \"mods\" for the first time. We turned on the custom bag mod where you have a bag for every item type. It seems almost as bad as a cluttered inventory to lose your items in each bag and go searching for them with then no way to sell items from inside the bags. Any tips on inventory and making these bags work in a user friendly way?",

            "Just finished a Skyrim play through and decided to pick up this game. Of course since I was coming from Skyrim I set myself up in tactician mode because Skyrim difficulty is a joke. Am currently 10 hours and have been resetting the fight with the guy who summons a hound and the archers who constantly knock you down for like an hour now. Any tricks for that fight, also how badly am I gonna get fucked during this play through.",
            "I'm doing the quest Up In the Clouds, I have killed the Knight of Amadia, she attacked me when I didn't answer her question. I now don't know what to do. Guides say speaking with her completed a quest, but my active quest step is still Speak with the Knight of Amadia. Please assist, I feel dumb.\n\nUpdate: For the few maybe like me who forgot where the exit to the cloud temple is, it's near the face. How could you forget you ask? Save up there and not play for a few days, totally forgot how I got in. No idea how to resolve the issue I asked about however, I played through again, befriended her, and then found the vines. Maybe leaving updates the quest in the event you kill her? I don't know.",
            "What is the trigger for Gareth dying in act 1 before you meet him? I have beaten the game several time and this is the first time I go to ruined castle and see Gareth a pile of flesh and bone.",
            "Not a question but nowhere else to share a small thing.  Finished two playthroughs of BG3 and just didn't have it in me for a third and now installed DOS 2 and it feels like I'm home again.  Wish I knew about this genre WAY SOONER."
