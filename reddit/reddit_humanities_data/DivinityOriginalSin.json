        "content": "Another 6 month since the last Megathread.\n\n[Link to the last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/lrn0gx/quick_question_megathread/)\n\n**Make sure to include the game(DOS, DOS EE, DOS2, DOS2 DE) in your question and mark your spoilers**\n\nThe FAQ for DOS2 will be built as we go along:\n\n>My game has a problem/doesn't work properly, what do I do?\n\nCheck [this](https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/6/3223871682609294995/) out. If you can't find a solution there contact Larian support as detailed.\n\n>Do I need to play the previous game to understand the story?\n\nNo, there is a timegap of 1000 years between DOS and DOS2. The overall timeline of the Divinity games in perspective to DOS2 looks like this: DOS2 is set 1222 years after DOS1, 24 years after Divine Divinity, 4 years after Beyond Divinity, and 58 years before Divinity 2.\n\n>How many people can play at once?\n\n* Up to 4 Players in the campaign and up to 4 players and a gamemaster in Gamemaster Mode.\n\n>Do I need to buy the game to play with my friends.\n\n* That depends on how you will play. Up to 2 Players can play on the same PC for a \"couch coop\" experience. This means you can have 4 player sessions with 2 copies of the game when using this method. If you don't play on the same PC each player is going to require his/her own copy.\n\n>Can I mix and match inputs for PC couch coop?\n\n* You can't use keyboard and mouse for couch coop, however you can mix controllers.\n\n>What's the deal with origin stories?\n\n* A custom character has no ties in the world whatsoever, nobody knows you. Origin characters on the other hand do have ties in the gameworld, that means people can recognise you and might interact differently with an origin character because of that characters reputation or because the characters have met before. Furthermore origin characters have their own questlines that run alongside the main story.\n\n>I don't like my build! Can I change it?\n\n* Yes! Once you leave the first island you get access to infinite respecs, with the second gift bag you can even get a respec mirror on the first island.\n\n>What are the new crafting recipes from the gift bag?\n\n* [List](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137514488)",

            "DOS2 DE PC: My party is using the gift bag \"mods\" for the first time. We turned on the custom bag mod where you have a bag for every item type. It seems almost as bad as a cluttered inventory to lose your items in each bag and go searching for them with then no way to sell items from inside the bags. Any tips on inventory and making these bags work in a user friendly way?",
            "Who is the fucking shithead who programmed a new \"launcher\" which is bigger than the screen, not movable and makes it virtually impossible to play the fucking game?",

I've essentially spent 12 hours getting repeatedly murdered (often self-inflicted) and completely failing to pick a team.\n\nI need someone to recommend a solid starting crew, with ideal skills per character.\n\nYes, I'm fully aware \"staring builds don't matter that much\" and \"you get a full respec anyway\". This doesn't help. At all. I'm already drowning in choices I can't make. Being able to unmake them just adds another level of total cluelessness\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp me. Please.",

            "Just finished a Skyrim play through and decided to pick up this game. Of course since I was coming from Skyrim I set myself up in tactician mode because Skyrim difficulty is a joke. Am currently 10 hours and have been resetting the fight with the guy who summons a hound and the archers who constantly knock you down for like an hour now. Any tricks for that fight, also how badly am I gonna get fucked during this play through.",
            "I'm doing the quest Up In the Clouds, I have killed the Knight of Amadia, she attacked me when I didn't answer her question. I now don't know what to do. Guides say speaking with her completed a quest, but my active quest step is still Speak with the Knight of Amadia. Please assist, I feel dumb.\n\nUpdate: For the few maybe like me who forgot where the exit to the cloud temple is, it's near the face. How could you forget you ask? Save up there and not play for a few days, totally forgot how I got in. No idea how to resolve the issue I asked about however, I played through again, befriended her, and then found the vines. Maybe leaving updates the quest in the event you kill her? I don't know."

I think I\u2019m ready to jump back in on tactician or home mode if you\u2019re up to it as well. I\u2019m a 20 year old college student with a part time job as well so I\u2019m usually available after 9pm EST. I don\u2019t really care about your age as long as you\u2019re 18+, I\u2019m not interested in playing with any kids sorry. My discord is ItsPlum#2222. You can contact me there or here.

            "* **Game:** DOS2\n* **Platform:** PC\n* **Contact Info:** A message here on Reddit or through Discord at HorrorFan546#2808 would be best.\n* **Usual Hours:** I work Friday through Tuesday from 7 AM to 4 PM EST/EDT, so in general I'd be most available in the evenings. The big exception to this is Wednesdays, when I have an online Pathfinder 2e session from 6-9 PM.\n* **Other Stuff:**\n   * The biggest thing I need to mention is that due to being mute, I unfortunately cannot use voice chat for communication. I can however listen in and type responses as necessary, if someone really wants to; or going full text-only communication is an option too.\n   * As far as age group goes, I'm gonna say 18+ only, just to avoid any potential awkwardness from being in my 20s and playing with a bunch of younger teens or whatever. LGBTQ+ & PoC friendliness is also a must, because I won't tolerate any sort of bigotry.\n   * This *is* kind of my first playthrough still, since the furthest I ever made it was midway through Act 2 on PS4 with a co-op partner who wound up ghosting for some reason. With that said though, I am open to the inclusion of some quality of life mods from either Nexus or the Gift Bags.\n   * I played DOS1 (and what I have played of 2) on Tactician difficulty, so I would certainly prefer to stick with that. No Honour Mode though; I'm not ready for a permadeath run quite yet.",
