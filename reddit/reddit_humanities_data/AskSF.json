        "content": "Hey /r/askSF!\n\nIn 2024, the sub has doubled in size, growing to 113K+ subscribers. With more subscribers, there's a ton more traffic and posts. One of the most popular topics is moving to SF and, in turn, these posts are the most commonly removed. There's been a noticeable increase in posts that boil down to \"I'm moving to the city, where should I live?\" that provide little to no information. To ensure OP's receive quality recommendations and to prevent endless comment loops, **we're requiring all Moving-to-SF posts to include the following information:**\n\n* Budget\n* Roommate status (solo, splitting rent w/ partner, seeking roommates, etc.)\n* Desired neighborhood(s) or preferred neighborhood amenities (dining, shopping, noise, etc.)\n\nWe *recommend* that OP's provide additional information such as:\n\n* Commute consideration\n* Housing preference (mom and pop landlords, condo, managed apt complexes, SFH rentals, etc.)\n* Additional personal preferences (pets, garage access, density, weather, etc.)\n\nWe're a small mod team so we are asking you, the community, to help up identify these posts! If you spot a moving submission that should have more information, please report the posts, select the breaking AskSF's rules, and select \"Vague, overly broad, or low information\" as the reason. We'll review the report and potentially ask OP to repost with more info. \n\nHere's to more questions answered in 2024 and beyond!",

        "content": "Hello!! So I am a recent graduate (22F) from MI and have received a job offer in SF, looking for some general advice before anything is final, especially since I have never visited! I would be working out of FiDi, and it\u2019s looking like the salary will be around 85,000/yr which I know is not the best but to get this on my resume would look killer in my industry! I\u2019m pretty open location wise, with it being a hybrid position I can probably eat a 30-40 minute commute if needed. I did ideally want to have a private studio/1 bed but from my exploration so far it it seemingly like that is pretty unrealistic with my budget, definitely wanting to keep it around 1500-1600. For some context,  I grew up right of outside of detroit, pretty *decent* neighborhood but can be gritty and I would definitely not walk home alone at night lol. Any tips or suggestions? Thanks!!",

            "Since you have never even stepped foot in SF, I would recommend doing a temporary sublet so you can check out the different neighborhoods because SF is VERY neighborhood based with distinct personalities and weather for each one.  For someone young, I'd say North Beach, Marina, Hayes Valley, Mission, Soma, and Dogpatch could be good for you. Just depends are you more mainstream, waspy or hipster, alt?",
            "Roommates is probably a good call. On that salary you'll be pretty comfortable with roommates. Facebook and craigslist are both good places to find houses looking for roommates-- super common for young people in SF! Plus it can be a nice way to meet new people when you land here.",
            "What do you want in your neighborhood?",
            "Your budget will likely require roommates. My wife rents a room in a shared 4-2 house for $1650. They\u2019re mostly nurses and work different shifts and many live in other states (very common in SF). It\u2019s really not as bad as you\u2019d think; when I visit, it never feels like 4 people live there. It\u2019s not a bad idea to begin with roommates until you get feel for the city and have higher income.",
            "Also moved from MI and even though I\u2019ve visited SF multiple times since I\u2019m a CA native, I rented a long term airbnb first. There was a nice price break for long terms over 3 weeks. Then you don\u2019t rush finding a place. :) \n\nStorage units are actually priced similar to MI so if you have stuff that you don\u2019t want to lug around, it\u2019s a cost effective way.",
            "Since you would work in FiDi when you have to go into the office, you might also want to look for places outside of San Francisco like San Bruno or Oakland, but close to a Bart station",
            "Take a market trip but do it with a purpose. Try to pick 2/3 areas from reviews or recommendations or ur own research and go see them. Maybe try to talk to property management companies in that area. Do the commute. But specifics and details matter and sometimes in ur position far away u can get caught up in the big picture excitement versus the execution part",
            "Are you working regular business hours, or something like regular business hours?\n\nIf so, you could live in Oakland, near the 12th St., 19th St., or Lake Merritt BART stations. That area skews younger, you could get a pretty good studio within your budget, and you'd have about a 30-40 minute commute to FiDi.",
            "Check Lower Nob Hill. You can find some studios nearish your budget.",
            "You can usually find an inlaw apartment in outer sunset or outer richmond for that budget without an issue. But I suspect lots of people apply to them so you may have competition. I made a LOT less than what you are making and yet I made it work for 8 years in San Francisco. I got lucky with a couple of great small inlaw apartments for that range (and even cheaper)"
