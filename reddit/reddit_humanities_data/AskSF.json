        "content": "Hey /r/askSF!\n\nIn 2024, the sub has doubled in size, growing to 113K+ subscribers. With more subscribers, there's a ton more traffic and posts. One of the most popular topics is moving to SF and, in turn, these posts are the most commonly removed. There's been a noticeable increase in posts that boil down to \"I'm moving to the city, where should I live?\" that provide little to no information. To ensure OP's receive quality recommendations and to prevent endless comment loops, **we're requiring all Moving-to-SF posts to include the following information:**\n\n* Budget\n* Roommate status (solo, splitting rent w/ partner, seeking roommates, etc.)\n* Desired neighborhood(s) or preferred neighborhood amenities (dining, shopping, noise, etc.)\n\nWe *recommend* that OP's provide additional information such as:\n\n* Commute consideration\n* Housing preference (mom and pop landlords, condo, managed apt complexes, SFH rentals, etc.)\n* Additional personal preferences (pets, garage access, density, weather, etc.)\n\nWe're a small mod team so we are asking you, the community, to help up identify these posts! If you spot a moving submission that should have more information, please report the posts, select the breaking AskSF's rules, and select \"Vague, overly broad, or low information\" as the reason. We'll review the report and potentially ask OP to repost with more info. \n\nHere's to more questions answered in 2024 and beyond!",

I\u2019m on a bit of a budget and pregnant and so I\u2019ve made a few bookings for places to eat based on recommendations I\u2019ve seen here but I\u2019m looking for cheap and healthy options for some meals. Having to actively work on healthy eating to avoid more than the recommended pregnancy weight gain hence the question. \n\nI am staying in Nob Hill \n\nI\u2019ve read lots of stores will do me a take away salad box and made a list of some options for this which is ideal \n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for healthy breakfast options? Eg granola and yoghurt, eggs on toast but not cooked with lots of butter, etc\n\nAre there any areas with decent food trucks that will give me cheaper meals? (Though I accept likely not healthier) \n\nUnfortunately I won\u2019t have cooking facilities though will hopefully have a fridge ",

        "content": "Hello!! So I am a recent graduate (22F) from MI and have received a job offer in SF, looking for some general advice before anything is final, especially since I have never visited! I would be working out of FiDi, and it\u2019s looking like the salary will be around 85,000/yr which I know is not the best but to get this on my resume would look killer in my industry! I\u2019m pretty open location wise, with it being a hybrid position I can probably eat a 30-40 minute commute if needed. I did ideally want to have a private studio/1 bed but from my exploration so far it it seemingly like that is pretty unrealistic with my budget, definitely wanting to keep it around 1500-1600. For some context,  I grew up right of outside of detroit, pretty *decent* neighborhood but can be gritty and I would definitely not walk home alone at night lol. Any tips or suggestions? Thanks!!",

            "Since you have never even step foot in SF, I would recommend doing a temporary sublet so you can check out the different neighborhoods because SF is VERY neighborhood based with distinct personalities and weather for each one.  For someone young, I'd say North Beach, Marina, Hayes Valley, Mission, Soma, and Dogpatch could be good for you. Just depends are you more mainstream, waspy or hipster, alt?",
            "Roommates is probably a good call. On that salary you'll be pretty comfortable with roommates. Facebook and craigslist are both good places to find houses looking for roommates-- super common for young people in SF! Plus it can be a nice way to meet new people when you land here.",
            "What do you want in your neighborhood?",
            "Your budget will likely require roommates. My wife rents a room in a shared 4-2 house for $1650. They\u2019re mostly nurses and work different shifts and many live in other states (very common in SF). It\u2019s really not as bad as you\u2019d think; when I visit, it never feels like 4 people live there. It\u2019s not a bad idea to begin with roommates until you get feel for the city and have higher income.",
            "Also moved from MI and even though I\u2019ve visited SF multiple times since I\u2019m a CA native, I rented a long term airbnb first. There was a nice price break for long terms over 3 weeks. Then you don\u2019t rush finding a place. :) \n\nStorage units are actually priced similar to MI so if you have stuff that you don\u2019t want to lug around, it\u2019s a cost effective way.",
            "Since you would work in FiDi when you have to go into the office, you might also want to look for places outside of San Francisco like San Bruno or Oakland, but close to a Bart station",
            "Take a market trip but do it with a purpose. Try to pick 2/3 areas from reviews or recommendations or ur own research and go see them. Maybe try to talk to property management companies in that area. Do the commute. But specifics and details matter and sometimes in ur position far away u can get caught up in the big picture excitement versus the execution part",
            "First, congrats on the job offer and making the move, that\u2019s huge!!!\n\nSince you will be working out of fidi and have a smaller housing budget, I recommend you check out the sunset neighborhood, specifically close to the \u201cN-judah\u201d muni train which runs on Judah all the way to the beach. This train goes in a tunnel under the mountain and then along market street straight to Fidi, so your commute will be around 30 minutes and consist of walking to the train, ride the train, and walk to the office. \n\nYou\u2019ll be able to find houses with different roommates in this neighborhood. I recommend you join some Facebook groups to put some feelers out!\n\nI work hybrid out of fidi myself and take the n right to work which takes me a little over 20 minutes (I\u2019m in Cole valley so right after the sunset on the way to fidi), and this is the best and smoothest commute I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nHope this helps!",
            "Are you working regular business hours, or something like regular business hours?\n\nIf so, you could live in Oakland, near the 12th St., 19th St., or Lake Merritt BART stations. That area skews younger, you could get a pretty good studio within your budget, and you'd have about a 30-40 minute commute to FiDi.",
            "Check Lower Nob Hill. You can find some studios nearish your budget."

            "To me SF Fitness is fine.  Previously I did Citysport at Stonestown and I felt that place was much more crowded (both for parking and getting on squat racks or bench racks)- though it was a bit cheaper.",
            "Given your location, I highly recommend [Koret](https://www.usfca.edu/koret/membership/membership-types) \u2014 USF\u2019s gym \u2014 which should be fairly accessible to you depending on how northeast in Inner Sunset you are. \n\nKoret has 3 squat racks, 2 smith machines, 4 pairs of cables, two rooms of free weights with at least one of them going up to 120lbs (possibly both) as well as a bunch of other great amenities (pool, boxing ring/heavy bag, and probably 90% of the machines you\u2019d ever hope to be able to use).\n\nAs a non-NoPa resident you are limited to entering between 8am-2pm which are their off-peak hours but it sounds like that would be your ideal time range anyway. It\u2019s definitely not busy on the earlier end of that range, especially during the 1/3 of the year when school is out. Cables occasionally require a wait of a couple of minutes if you\u2019re doubling up but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had to wait to bench, squat, or deadlift.\n\nThe time restriction means that you also get a pretty killer deal that works out to $7/visit (15 visits for $105).",

            "Can I ask which location you go to and like morning or evening?",
