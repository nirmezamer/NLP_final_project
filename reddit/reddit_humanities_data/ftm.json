It's a dumb and shitty thing to say",

You can have the same dysphoria level at a smaller size. Just because a larger chest can make it harder to bind or pass doesnt mean you automatically cant have dysphoria or dont deserve surgery. I would have had just as much dysphoria had I been with a small chest tbh.",

One change that I can't wait for is for my hips to come in, it's one of the clearest things that's always felt wrong to me about my body. This made me think though about how I'm sure there must be plenty of trans guys out there who are dysphoric about their hips. It's honestly kind of difficult for me to see it as anything other than direct upgrade, especially since my FtM boyfriend isn't dysphoric about his hips, but I know that that's just my bias.\n\nWhat is your hip dysphoria like (if that's not too forthcoming to ask)? I kind of imagine it being like my dysphoria about my broad shoulders, in that it's a part of the body that feels so much wider than it should be.",

It's just distressing to see my hips. sometimes I hold my hand or arms in front of them in the mirror so it looks like a straight line from my torso and it's just like, that's how I'm supposed to look! but no, there's these extra bits of flesh sticking out that aren't supposed to be there.",
            "I feel like my hips are as wide as a house (they aren't) and that everyone who sees me must notice them immediately (they didn't lol). I feel aware of them all the time. It's the way I used to feel about my chest. Since I got top surgery, I don't notice or think about my chest at all, which was the goal lol. It just feels normal now. Hopefully one day I can get there about the hips. Good luck with your transition, I'm happy for you.",

            "The way I be having thick ethnic hips... Yes it's one of my biggest insecurities as it's the biggest flag on my body that I'm female. I come from a very curvy family and I got cake. Like I'm so serious sometimes it just looks SO goofy.",

            "Yup. One of my \"aha\" moments that I was trans came when this girl I was dating held me and said \"you have such womanly hips\". I damn near lost my mind because I never saw any part of my body as \"womanly\" until then."

            "I have the weird experience of the opposite being true before starting t, which I know is particularly unusual. Queer people never believed me when I told them I didn't pass and think I was being hard on myself, and when meeting me would either assume I was a binary trans man or immediately ask me my pronouns. Weird boomers were the ones that ma'amed me constantly.",
            "This exactly. It's *much* harder for me to pass in progressive places. In Canada I passed 0%, in Nepal I pass exactly as much as I want to. If I am in company where I still haven't come out, I can wear a dress and people will immediately assume woman. If I'm out with friends I trust, I'll wear a more masc outfit and every stranger who sees me will call me sir. It's so much easier to pass however you want in nepal. Mostly as long as you wear clothing and/or have a hairstyle associated with the gender you're trying to present as, nobody will even notice anything else about you. I can literally pass as male with my 36F chest (no binder usually) with no issues",
            "I can also second this, however I will admit that I really never had any issues passing after I started T (I went from looking like a butch lesbian to looking like a cis straight guy), but because of that I never felt welcome in queer spaces because I was just like cis men. I dont even know if this helps but I understand how you feel, but in the opposite way. I feel like I pass TOO much",
            "Agreeing with this bc it was my experience while working customer service early in transition. The older folks were more likely to \"sir\" me based on clothing and haircut, and the younger more tuned-in folks were more likely to \"miss\" me.",
            "I second what the other commented said about passing in queer spaces, but also, nine months on T isn't even that long. \n\nAnd maybe it's a bit harsh but there's something, maybe your clothes or hair, or appearance or mannerisms or way you speak or general dynamic with your friends or idk, literally a quatrillion things that's holding you back from passing. \n\nThis isn't meant to be an accusation, I just usually think of it as some sort of balance; how many femmenine/not hyper-masc things can you have and still pass? Pre-everything the number is usually from very low to non-existant, but as we go along our transition in the many ways, specially with the big stuff like T, we can start to just be a normal human being doing our stuff without worrying *too* much. \n\nSo, something's flicking that scale against your favour, that's the bad news. Good news are it can only get better now, T will continue to work its magic and who know, maybe you'll do some voice training that'll help, or one lucky T-shirt society liked enough; perhaps you're even one haircut away from being gendered correctly (I know I was lol). \n\nSo... just relax. You're only at the beggining of the rode, nobody expected for a whole magical flip to be swiched in less than a year (and if you did... yeah sorry). Go back and enjoy the time spent with your friends and remember all those who missgender you don't know you actually now have a dick."

Trying to explain something to that kind of people is really hard, cause after ussr Ukrainians still very uneducated about lgbt+ people and that cause tons of stereotypes and assumptions, that's not correct.

Not that long ago Ukrainian lgbt+ film \"Tolerance lessons\" ( ) came out, it's about gay man's interaction with average Ukrainian family, not exactly what you're looking for, but good start.
