The next president will have the chance to most likely appoint 2 new SCJ and I need to vote for the person who is most likely to appoint SCJs that won't try to revoke my rights to simply exist. This is going to be a rough 4 years no matter who gets elected, so I'm trying to think long-term about what is best for our country past this upcoming term and just try to hunker down and survive until better options become available.",

Theres no third option where if enough people avoid voting out of moral principle because they don\u2019t like Biden they go \u201cOh! Guess no president this time!\u201d\n\nIf a bus is driving through a rainstorm with 50 passengers and 1 votes to pull over and wait, and two vote to drive off a cliff to get out of the situation, and everyone else abstains because they don\u2019t like either option: the bus is going off a cliff.",

Trump actively breaks the law and wants to be a dictator.\n\n\nI would love it if we had a better candidate than Biden, but the way the US electoral system works, it's very difficult for third-party candidates to stand a chance.\u00a0\n\n\nI also think it's really important to be conscious of what the president can and can't directly control. Even a great president is going to be limited by a legislative branch where MAGA Republicans refuse to cooperate and a Supreme Court that currently skews conservative and has multiple Trump appointees. The president also has limited power over state laws\u00a0",

Before T, all the notes on the scale were accessed with pretty much the same technique. Now I notice a couple of really marked transition points on the scale where if I don\u2019t change my technique, my pitch does all kinds of weird stuff. \n\nSing an open note in your chest voice, then slide up the pitch without stopping, like a slide whistle. There might be a point at which your voice cuts out for an instant, and when it comes back the note you produce might be quite a bit higher or more whistle-like than you intended. Wherever your voice cut out, that\u2019s the note you have to avoid, because singing or woo-ing anywhere near it is likely to make your voice crack. Learn to hold a note and do scales above that breaking point to strengthen your head voice, then find a comfortable note or couple of notes in that head voice to practice woo-ing at. \n\nAmateur singer, might not be using all the above terminology correctly, etc. but this is what worked for me.",

You gotta try to hoot and holler and find your new noises!! I've even improved my singing voice a bit!"
