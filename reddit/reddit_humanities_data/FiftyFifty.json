        "content": "##**>>THE SIDEBAR<<**\n---\n\n##**Troubleshooting**\n\n**If you CANNOT SEE ANY NSFW POSTS**\n\nChange your account settings to enable NSFW content [by clicking here.](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/) \n\nTick the 'I'm over 18 years old.....' box ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/qAPtyKeh.jpg)) and **SAVE** those settings.\n\n---\n\n##**When to upvote**\n\nIf the ***title of a post*** gives you a ***compelling choice, upvote!*** \n\nCompelling choice means that **one option encourages you to click and the other option discourage you from clicking**. Don't just upvote because you liked the actual outcome. \n\n---\n\n##**What is Original5050?**\n\nAn Original5050 post provides two possibilities in the title with only one actual result. Since you don't know which you'll get until you click the link, you have a 50/50 chance of getting one or the other. When the sub first started, this was the only way to make 5050 posts. You can submit an Original5050 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).\n\n##**What is True5050?**\n A True5050 post has two options in the title with two possible results. It will randomly pick and give users one of the two options. These posts are given a **[TRUE]** flair. Use [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) to create a True5050 post. \n\n**View Only True5050 Posts**\n\nIf you only want to browse True5050 posts, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiftyfifty/search?q=flair%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). This will filter out all Original5050 posts for you.\n\n**Submit a True5050 post** \n\nGo to [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) and enter both options there. The site will generate a link, which will randomly switch between both outcomes. Submit this link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).\n\n---\n\n##**Rules for Comments**\n\n**DO NOT** link the outcomes of any posts in the comments. Users that do so ***will be BANNED.*** This applies to True5050 and Original5050 posts. Asking for links/DMs is also banworthy. \n\n----\n\n##**Rules for Submissions**\n\n**I. Title Formatting**\n\n>Your title has to start with [50/50], have two clear options in your title (one must be good and one must be bad), and include either \"NSFL\", \"NSFW\" or \"SFW\". \n\n>Formatting example: [50/50] Bouncing boobies (NSFW) | Man Disembowelled in Pool (NSFL)\n\n>**One option should encourage people to click and the other option should discourage them from clicking.** If an option is just neutral or boring, the submission will be removed.\n\n\n\n **II. Only Use Approved Image Domains**\n\n>Post have to be hosted on [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Giphy](http://giphy.com), [Postimage](http://postimage.org), [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com), [Minus](http://minus.com), [YouTube](http://youtube.com), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), [Liveleak](http://liveleak.com), [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk), [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) or directly on /r/FiftyFifty. \n\n**III. No Illegal Content**\n\n>The following options are **NOT PERMITTED**, *even if it's only the made-up option*:\n\n>* Propaganda (Perpetrators are producing & sharing content to encourage their worldview like the Christchurch shooting video or ISIS executions)\n\n>* Content which authorities asked the public not to share (like the images of Bataclan after the terror attack) \n\n>* Rape or Molestation\n\n>* Child or Animal Porn\n\n>* Animal Cruelty\n\n>* Dead or Injured Children\n\n>* Depictions of Suicide / Intentional Self-Harm\n\n**IV. Descriptive & Clear Options**\n\n>If users click your link, they get either the first or the second option. Both options have to be descriptive & clear. \n\n>* **Descriptive:** It's not necessary to interpret your title. Before clicking the link, users know exactly what 2 options they can expect. Do not insert your opinions about the content in the title. \n\n>* **Clear:** It's not possible to confuse the 2 options. **Instantly** after clicking the link, it's clear which option the users got  - without relying on context (like video titles or 18+ warnings).\n\n**V. True5050 for Porn, Cute Animals & Spoilers**\n\n>The following options **MUST be in True5050 form** ([5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com)), *even if it's only the made-up option*:\n\n>* Porn (sexualized nudity, actions or body parts)\n>* Cute animals\n>* Spoilers \n\n**VI. Other Forbidden 50/50s**\n\n>* Memes or low effort posts\n>* [Self-Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (Instant perm ban)\n>* Fake or hacked nudes\n>* Trans, gay or male porn as bad option\n>* Loud noises / Jump scares\n>* Opinions (like naming a song a bad option just because you don't like it)\n>* Mentioning your connection (like \"My dog\")\n>* Villains as the Good Option (like Hitler)\n\n**VII. Moderator discretion**\n\n>Mods reserve the right to remove any offending post or comment *at their own discretion*. You may appeal any mod action taken against you, but you're not entitled to a response.\n\n----\n\nPS: This is an exact copy of the sidebar.
