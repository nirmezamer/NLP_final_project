        "content": "So this started with me being bored and wanting to make a quick sheet to track our squad numbers and work out exactly what we'll have space for in terms of player purchases. You have to assume some sales but i think it shows what we can do.\n\nAfter doing our squad i thought it would be good to compare it too other Premier League European squads from last season and how they are sitting squad wise. In these snapshots Spurs are set up as where i think we're going and the others are the registered European squads from last year.\n\nI've researched all this as best i can but none of it is put down clearly anywhere. Spurs I'm pretty confident is right but others might be slightly off in terms of how a player is classified or have a young talent missing.\n\nOne thing that changed for me doing this was how i see the List A break down, people often refer to the 17 man non homegrown (Non HG) list or 17 person foreign player list.\n\nIts neither of those things, its a 17 player unrestricted list, anyone can use one of those squad places. You could have a squad of 25 Club trained players if you wanted, which is basically what Athletic Bilbao do because of their Basque only recruitment policy.\n\nI gathered the data last week and obviously with the great PSR circle jerk this weekend some of these squads have started changing now. But it gives an idea of what they're all doing.\n\n**Spurs-**\n\nAbove the players that have already gone we have to sell/loan all of Royal, Gil, Hojbjerg, Lo Celso, Solomon, Reguilon, Spence and Rodon to make 5 squad spaces, 3 unrestricted spaces and 2 AT spaces. Because of the differences in rules between UEFA and the Prem i think we'll get away with not naming Forster and Davies to the European squad but they'll still be registered for the Prem.\n\nBut without some surprise sales or purchasing previously Club trained players (Walker-Peters, Edwards) I don't think we expect more than 5 incomings.\n\nAs the squad looks with sales and depending on where you see current players playing in this system we'll need to target:\n\nRB, LCB/LB hybrid, DM/CM, AM/Winger, CF/Winger.\n\nWe should be going pretty big in each position to meet the needs for good squad rotation throughout the season.\n\nHopefully some of the U21's come good, we have some really talented ones, but most won't be CT list eligible for 3 years. So that list might be baron for a time but don't panic they're coming and in the mean time can be on the B list.\n\n**Man City-**\n\nHonestly not the most balanced squad but they can buy best in class for whatever position they need and there's some good U21's coming through soon.\n\nPotentially a huge transition coming up for them with Pep's contract running down, De Bruyne and Walker aging out and Silva and Ederson talking about leaving. That's some major upheaval even for City to cope with.\n\n**Arsenal-**\n\nAnnoyingly in a really strong position squad wise. Good CT players, good AT players, good non HG players and some obvious sales to make room for some better players. Plus they have a bunch of highly rated U21 players and a good track record for developing them/selling them for good money.\n\nThey're already scary good but could easily get scarier.\n\n**Liverpool-**\n\n4 U21 players with good Prem experience already that they need to plan moving into the A list when they hit the right age. No need for AT players if you keep producing your own CT players.\n\nWill probably sell 3-4 players to let Slot bring in some that he wants.\n\n**Aston Villa-**\n\nCurrently sacrificing all their CT talent to the PRS gods which will hamper their squad size but they have good AT players and are gaining more.\n\nLosing Luiz is bad, Lenglet and Zaniolo are going back and they have already filled those spaces with young talents. They really need these players to hit the ground running or it could be a tough season especially with Champion's League.\n\n**Newcastle-**\n\nThe team that made me change how i think about these squads, 9 Non HG players and 12 AT players. That just never crossed my mind, it was always get the 17 best Non HG players you can.\n\nLike Villa, they are having to mess about pre June 30th for PSR and I'm not sure either are strengthening but if it means Newcastle can keep hold of Bruno and Isak then its probably worth it.\n\n**Learnings-**\n\nMost teams don't fill their European squad's fully so not to worry if we don't.\n\nThe other clubs have at least 4 really good/useful AT players. We have 2 in Maddison and Johnson so could do with 2 more, keep those Eze wishes going people.\n\nGenerating first team level CT players is really useful for the squad or bank balance.\n\nIf the player is U21 but ineligible for the B list they have to take the relevant spot on the A list depending if they're Non HG or AT. See Bergvall for us or Ben Doak at Liverpool.\n\nBecause we might need to buy 1-2 AT players i think we're waiting to get that business done before going after other positions. The pool of AT players we would want is much smaller than the pool of Non HG players for each position so if you get the Non HG players first you're really narrowing your options for the remaining positions.\n\nWe really need to sell those players we don't want or there's no space.\n\nCOYS.\n\n\\*This was really interesting to do and i hope its mostly right. Why none of this information is clearly detailed anywhere is baffling. I've included some alternative visuals of how the squads work because i know these rules aren't the clearest and different people will understand that way more.\\*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1s11id8ij8d1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39ac22531478ba35a4996ebc52624ef25b3732a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjdunhd8ij8d1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2d106a25158cfdc1fdd26dca94624229ef34b3d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xpn1id8ij8d1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=f78f86aec30ab671977be6073c632a223b61a7b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e52y3id8ij8d1.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=422c55e7b9f37d5f84d5dc4face19eff3213b42e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvydwkd8ij8d1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=041dbfe00584e065b54717fbd9fef34077094ace\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5s7yghd8ij8d1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b1754d13608f157c948f79f4ff95c666d13a66\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofx92jd8ij8d1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ec6d300adfc2dcc291e31e3d1994bb9ee3c8359\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7waryjd8ij8d1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83a7aedd6b96e093f29085c132af29011cb1e9d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phqphhd8ij8d1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=dae8b2eee166868c9802798a6035314f9a8888d7\n\n",

            "i hope people absorb this to alleviate the tizzy that this sub has worked itself into about our HG/AT/etc numbers.  it has too many people screaming for iffy (at best) players like KWP and Edwards, players that NO ONE would even consider if they weren't ex-Spurs.\n\nour daunting task is getting rid of players with no future here.  nothing really settles itself until we move out those who do not fit.",

            "TLDR: We need to buy \n\nSeriously though - great post",
            "Villas position is why Im happy we didnt actually get that last CL spot. Were still a few windows away from having the depth necessary to compete in multiple simultaneous competitions. The early stages of Europa should give us more flexibility to rotate our squad.",
            "With Bergvall being U21 is it true that he wouldnt occupy one of the 17 unrestricted spots?",
            "In your Liverpool squad list, you listed Thiago and Adrian as possible sells. \n\nThey can't be sells, because their contracts have already ended."
