        "content": "So this started with me being bored and wanting to make a quick sheet to track our squad numbers and work out exactly what we'll have space for in terms of player purchases. You have to assume some sales but i think it shows what we can do.\n\nAfter doing our squad i thought it would be good to compare it too other Premier League European squads from last season and how they are sitting squad wise. In these snapshots Spurs are set up as where i think we're going and the others are the registered European squads from last year.\n\nI've researched all this as best i can but none of it is put down clearly anywhere. Spurs I'm pretty confident is right but others might be slightly off in terms of how a player is classified or have a young talent missing.\n\nOne thing that changed for me doing this was how i see the List A break down, people often refer to the 17 man non homegrown (Non HG) list or 17 person foreign player list.\n\nIts neither of those things, its a 17 player unrestricted list, anyone can use one of those squad places. You could have a squad of 25 Club trained players if you wanted, which is basically what Athletic Bilbao do because of their Basque only recruitment policy.\n\nI gathered the data last week and obviously with the great PSR circle jerk this weekend some of these squads have started changing now. But it gives an idea of what they're all doing.\n\n**Spurs-**\n\nAbove the players that have already gone we have to sell/loan all of Royal, Gil, Hojbjerg, Lo Celso, Solomon, Reguilon, Spence and Rodon to make 5 squad spaces, 3 unrestricted spaces and 2 AT spaces. Because of the differences in rules between UEFA and the Prem i think we'll get away with not naming Forster and Davies to the European squad but they'll still be registered for the Prem.\n\nBut without some surprise sales or purchasing previously Club trained players (Walker-Peters, Edwards) I don't think we expect more than 5 incomings.\n\nAs the squad looks with sales and depending on where you see current players playing in this system we'll need to target:\n\nRB, LCB/LB hybrid, DM/CM, AM/Winger, CF/Winger.\n\nWe should be going pretty big in each position to meet the needs for good squad rotation throughout the season.\n\nHopefully some of the U21's come good, we have some really talented ones, but most won't be CT list eligible for 3 years. So that list might be baron for a time but don't panic they're coming and in the mean time can be on the B list.\n\n**Man City-**\n\nHonestly not the most balanced squad but they can buy best in class for whatever position they need and there's some good U21's coming through soon.\n\nPotentially a huge transition coming up for them with Pep's contract running down, De Bruyne and Walker aging out and Silva and Ederson talking about leaving. That's some major upheaval even for City to cope with.\n\n**Arsenal-**\n\nAnnoyingly in a really strong position squad wise. Good CT players, good AT players, good non HG players and some obvious sales to make room for some better players. Plus they have a bunch of highly rated U21 players and a good track record for developing them/selling them for good money.\n\nThey're already scary good but could easily get scarier.\n\n**Liverpool-**\n\n4 U21 players with good Prem experience already that they need to plan moving into the A list when they hit the right age. No need for AT players if you keep producing your own CT players.\n\nWill probably sell 3-4 players to let Slot bring in some that he wants.\n\n**Aston Villa-**\n\nCurrently sacrificing all their CT talent to the PRS gods which will hamper their squad size but they have good AT players and are gaining more.\n\nLosing Luiz is bad, Lenglet and Zaniolo are going back and they have already filled those spaces with young talents. They really need these players to hit the ground running or it could be a tough season especially with Champion's League.\n\n**Newcastle-**\n\nThe team that made me change how i think about these squads, 9 Non HG players and 12 AT players. That just never crossed my mind, it was always get the 17 best Non HG players you can.\n\nLike Villa, they are having to mess about pre June 30th for PSR and I'm not sure either are strengthening but if it means Newcastle can keep hold of Bruno and Isak then its probably worth it.\n\n**Learnings-**\n\nMost teams don't fill their European squad's fully so not to worry if we don't.\n\nThe other clubs have at least 4 really good/useful AT players. We have 2 in Maddison and Johnson so could do with 2 more, keep those Eze wishes going people.\n\nGenerating first team level CT players is really useful for the squad or bank balance.\n\nIf the player is U21 but ineligible for the B list they have to take the relevant spot on the A list depending if they're Non HG or AT. See Bergvall for us or Ben Doak at Liverpool.\n\nBecause we might need to buy 1-2 AT players i think we're waiting to get that business done before going after other positions. The pool of AT players we would want is much smaller than the pool of Non HG players for each position so if you get the Non HG players first you're really narrowing your options for the remaining positions.\n\nWe really need to sell those players we don't want or there's no space.\n\nCOYS.\n\n\\*This was really interesting to do and i hope its mostly right. Why none of this information is clearly detailed anywhere is baffling. I've included some alternative visuals of how the squads work because i know these rules aren't the clearest and different people will understand that way more.\\*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1s11id8ij8d1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39ac22531478ba35a4996ebc52624ef25b3732a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjdunhd8ij8d1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2d106a25158cfdc1fdd26dca94624229ef34b3d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xpn1id8ij8d1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=f78f86aec30ab671977be6073c632a223b61a7b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e52y3id8ij8d1.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=422c55e7b9f37d5f84d5dc4face19eff3213b42e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvydwkd8ij8d1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=041dbfe00584e065b54717fbd9fef34077094ace\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5s7yghd8ij8d1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b1754d13608f157c948f79f4ff95c666d13a66\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofx92jd8ij8d1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ec6d300adfc2dcc291e31e3d1994bb9ee3c8359\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7waryjd8ij8d1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83a7aedd6b96e093f29085c132af29011cb1e9d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phqphhd8ij8d1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=dae8b2eee166868c9802798a6035314f9a8888d7\n\n",

            "> One thing that changed for me doing this was how i see the List A break down, people often refer to the 17 man non homegrown (Non HG) list or 17 person foreign player list... Its neither of those things, its a 17 player unrestricted list, anyone can use one of those squad places\n\nThis is the number one thing I wish more people understood about the squad eligibility rules, both for Europe and the PL. There is no *minimum quantity* of players unless you're trying to fill a full 25 person squad, and those minimums apply to locally trained (i.e. Homegrown or Association-trained) players only.\n\nWe could field a squad of 11 HG players and nobody else if we wanted to, but so many fans seem to think that you must have a certain number of non-HG players in your lineup.",

            "There is a growing feeling that Jacob Ramsey could be prised away from Aston Villa by a bid of up to \u00a350million, football.london understands, as Tottenham look to strengthen Ange Postecoglou's midfield options ahead of a big season.\n\nSpurs are expected to make a few midfield changes this summer with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Giovani Lo Celso among those set to depart the club in the wake of Tanguy Ndombele's release. Postecoglou is keen to bring in new faces to provide fresh energy and creativity in the centre of the pitch to complement the likes of James Maddison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Matar Sarr and Oliver Skipp, who is looking for regular football next season, with Dejan Kulusevski also able to play in a deeper role.\n\nLucas Bergvall arrives next week following his \u00a38.5million switch from Djurgarden with Tottenham snapping up one of Scandinavia's brightest young talents in the 18-year-old Sweden international, who can play as a number eight or in more advanced roles.\n\nPostecoglou and Spurs technical director Johan Lange have compiled a list of potential midfielders to bring in to bolster the Australian's options as the north London club add Europa League fixtures to their Premier League ones as well as the FA Cup and Carabao Cup in a busy season.\n\nLange has been driving Tottenham's interest in Aston Villa's Jacob Ramsey. The Dane is a big fan of the midfielder, who turned 23 last month, and Tottenham made enquiries in January, soon after Lange's arrival at the club, about the availability of the player who can play in the centre of midfield or on the left. Postecoglou is understood to also feel the player would fit his system well.\n\nSpurs' interest in Ramsey, who has three years left on his contract at Villa Park, has not dulled despite his injury-hit season, and the north London club have enquired again about his availability this month with Villa, although suggestions of a formal offer being made yet have been played down on various sides.\n\nTottenham have probed to see whether Ramsey's fragmented campaign loosened Villa's desire to keep him in the face of a tempting offer, particularly with their previous need to get back within the profit and sustainability rules which the sale of Douglas Luiz to Juventus is now expected to remedy.\n\nThe initial indications were that the Midlands side, who will play Champions League football next season, were as unlikely to sell Ramsey as they did back in January. However, football.london understands that there is now a growing feeling that a bid of between \u00a340million and \u00a350million could yet prise him away if the player chose to leave his hometown club.\n\nTottenham also retain a strong interest in England midfielder Conor Gallagher. The 24-year-old played 50 games for Chelsea last season, the majority of them as captain under Mauricio Pochettino, but as of yet the Blues still have not entered into official talks over a new contract for the midfielder despite him having only 12 months left on his current deal.\n\nNew Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca also appears to be looking to bring his former Leicester midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall with him to Stamford Bridge after a sparkling season in the Championship. What that potential move means for Gallagher's game time remains to be seen, with the Blues player having spoken publicly about wanting to stay at the club.\n\nPostecoglou is known to be a big admirer of Gallagher. During his recent ITV stint as a pundit at Euro 2024, the Australian spoke about Gallagher's energy and how good he is at retaining the ball.\n\nAcross London but also within the England camp and the noises coming out of Crystal Palace are a growing insistence that Eberechi Eze is not for sale this summer following the impending departure of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich. That would appear to suggest that the reported release clause in Eze's deal is more complicated than initially thought.\n\nfootball.london also understands that Tottenham also have an interest in highly-rated Rennes midfielder Desire Doue, who turned 19 this month.\n\nThe versatile French midfielder is being watched by many of Europe's top sides and can play anywhere across the midfield, having turned out in the centre of midfield as well as on both the left wing and right wing at times over the recent campaign in Ligue 1. The teenager became more of a regular starter in the second half of the season and managed eight goal involvements in the final 19 matches.\n\nAnother talented teenager Tottenham have a firm interest in is Leeds United's Archie Gray. The 18-year-old is rated as one of the brightest young players in the country right now, and has already been namedchecked by England boss Gareth Southgate. The teenager is mainly a central midfielder, but played much of last season to great effect as a right-back, which would mark him out as a potential inverted right-back in Postecoglou's system.\n\nAs with Doue, many of Europe's top sides are tracking the availability of Gray, with Leeds needing to raise money this summer but believed to be loathe to lose the popular academy product, who has been valued at around \u00a350million and played 50 matches for them last season as they missed out on promotion after losing the play-off final to Southampton.\n\nThere are further options on Lange's midfield shortlist as Tottenham look to lean heavily on data-driven transfers, something Postecoglou was also keen to push this summer, to ensure that those chosen fit his system perfectly to avoid the expensive errors of the past.",
            "At the beginning of the season, we were so stacked at midfield. So weird that this happened",
            "Us having interest in Doue and Gray is the best news, if we aren\u2019t going for elite players then we should atleast target the elite talents.",
            "I'd like to get Dou\u00e9 simply because we could have Destiny and Desire on the same flank. He also seems a real talent.",
            "I have faith that whoever we sign will address areas of weakness and fit well within Ange\u2019s system. Weird to feel this unbothered by everything but our scouting recruitment has improved by leaps and bounds these past few years.",
            "Ange\u2019s obsession with Gallagher is now matched with Lange\u2019s love for Ramsey.",
            "To Destiny is to Desire.\n\nOr vice versa."
