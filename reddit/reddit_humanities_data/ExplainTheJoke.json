            "When something \u201cbig\u201d is happening pizza places near the pentagon and also Washington DC see an increase in sales as the staffers prepare to settle in for a late night or long couple days",
            "Pentagon employees working overtime so their bosses buy pizza for the office.",
            "The joke is related to the [\u201cpizza meter\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Meter#:~:text=The%20%22Pizza%20Meter%22%20is%20a,important%20political%20or%20military%20events.) which is a \u201cterm used to describe how the increase in pizza orders from offices of the United States government, such as the White House and The Pentagon, can be indicative of important political or military events\u201d",
            "As someone who operates a pizza place within 5 miles of the pentagon (Alexandria), it is a running joke that we are not allowed to know if and when we are selling large orders to government locales. Just gotta keep our heads down when John Smith orders 50 pizzas to be delivered to a private address on the side of town.",
            "I believe the same kind of phenomenon happens with Wall Street and stripper clubs",
            "A few years ago, the owner of several Dominos locations in the DC area noticed that whenever something big happened internationally, there would be a butt load of orders for pizza at the Pentagon.\n\nOddly enough, he went public with that.  Now the Pentagon has a policy to spread out their food orders across multiple different restaurants.",
            "Dont answer!! Hes a CIA plant!!!",
            "Bro imagine mulling over potential WW3 scenarios at work. Life and death stuff that will effect hundreds of millions of people. To cheer you up, here's your boss with a paper towel as a plate, handing you 1/20th of a pizza and room temperature soda in like a 4oz flimsy cup, just like in school lol",
            "Despite popular fiction like The West Wing showing White House employees eating takeout all the time, security protocols actually prevent them from bringing in outside food.  If you eat at the White House, you eat what the cafeteria serves.  I doubt this also applies to the pentagon or the capitol...",
            "During the Cold War, KGB agents would monitor the activity of pizza delivery restaurants near the Pentagon as an early warning of increased U.S. military operations."

            "The joke is that OP believes that Zelda is the name of the player in most other games in the series, Link.\n\nZelda has always been a girl.",
            "This is a modern style of internet-based humor known as \u201cbait\u201d. The poster is conveying an obviously incorrect view, and adding political dog whistles. This combination is extremely effective at getting people to respond in a smug and aggressive way, and then the original poster sits back and laughs at all the people they have upset.\u00a0",
            "I think this one specifically is satire, but there's discourse that nintendos gone woke by allowing you to play as zelda in her own dam game series when we've been asking for it for years. Bonus W for classic fans its going to be a classic isometric",
            "It's a dig on anti-woke culture which is a little too quick to call something \"woke\" for featuring a female MC (hence the \"Wokistan\"). The joke that Zelda is a girl is also a play on the long-running joke that the titular charactr is not in fact the main character, with OP basically stating that they thought they were playing as link.\n\nLastly, the Bud Light reference is in reference to the boycott last year that saw Bud Light stock tank becoming a meme in its own right after it became associated with being the \"gay beer\" after releasing an advertisement with controversial content creator Dylan Mulvaney. It was touted as a major \"get woke go broke\" moment by the anti-woke faction and thus is used here as a reference to Nintendo getting woke and going broke.",
            "I can\u2019t believe they made Zelda a girl.\n\nDisgusting.",
            "It's making fun of right-wing cancel culture. First off is the right's reluctance to accept a woman as the hero of any piece of media. Then there's a joke over their stupidity with the common joke of people unfamiliar with LOZ mistaking Link for Zelda. This joke then ties into mocking cancel culture for frequently viewing pieces of media at its face value. The reference to bud light is based on the far-rights most infamous frore into cancel culture: bud light which not only sponsored a trans woman but also released a limited edition set of pride themed cups spawning much controversy amongst extremist circles.",

            "People who take stimulants such as speed, meth, adderall, and cocaine in recreational dosages will often feel the need to be constantly moving which will often be their jaws as not to draw more attention to themselves than they already do. That\u2019s why a lot of meth head carry or have an abundance of chewing gum, so they don\u2019t grind their teeth when they are tweaking (aka high on a stimulant, most likely meth due to it being very cheap and easier to make than other stimulants)",
