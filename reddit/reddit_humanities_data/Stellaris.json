I'm kinda new to Stellaris, so I don't know if I am making a mistake, or if it's a mod issue, but my buildings that increase the production amount of my assorted drones just flat out don't work. E.G. energy grids, mineral purification plants, alloy foundries, etc. I am playing a DE machine empire, with the virtual path fully completed. The only major mods I have installed are gigastructural engineering and ui overhaul. But yeah, if I mouse over a, for example, tech drone, it says each is producing 1.2 energy credits, despite the energy nexus saying it should be making each one +4. Needless to say, this is insanely difficult to deal with, since I effectively can't make energy from any pops due to the energy drones costing me 3 energy per, and producing 1.2, thus making them actually drain more than they produce. Not to mention all my other resources being so slow to make. Any ideas what could be causing this?",

Don't ask me how they got control, as I certainly can't land an army there.  My ships won't attack the planet because it is under control of my ally, however my situation log still says I need to destroy the planet.  Is this a bug?  Is there a workaround?",

        "content": "Right now, pirates in Stellaris are incredibly idiotic. Congrats, you took control of a minor outpost station. Good for you! Now the next step of your master plan is obviously to stay and do absolutely nothing while the empire you're robbing sends a vastly superior fleet to make your atoms decide to take a little time apart from each other. Surely this could never go wrong! What if instead of capturing and holding one system until being destroyed, pirates went from system to system, taking a little bit of your energy credits for every system they captured? And what if when they detect a superior fleet nearby, pirates will attempt to flee to another system or even another empire? To make that less frustrating, pirate ships should probably be made slower than your fleets so it's easier to catch up. If you defeat them, you could do a short operation to retrieve all the stolen credits, but if they flee to another empire they disappear and those credits are lost forever. This would encourage the creation of small anti piracy fleets and the use of patrol routes, and it might be fun to try and cut off and surround the pirates (though I can also see how this can be very annoying). Another interesting addition might be privateers. It would be awesome if, through espionage or hiring an outside party, you could encourage piracy within another empire and gain a fraction of their energy credits. Perhaps you could even convert your own fleets into an independent privateer fleet, similar to mercenaries, which you can pay to rob other empires without an actual declaration of war? Perhaps there could even be naturally spawning pirate havens from which you could hire privateers, but that seems too similar to what marauders actually are. What do you think?",

            "Might be too complicated, but it'd be cool if the crime system was a little more involved - persistent high crime across multiple worlds makes \"minor empire\" type thing spawning that you can have some kind of relationship with, either a thorn in the side in terms of espionage and corruption, or a privateer type deal where you finance them, a la the mercenary enclave. might be a bit boring, but better than random crappy fleets spawning.\n\nalso, make the AI build defence platforms in low trade protection systems, to stop them constantly having to deal with little pirate fleets always? it's just stupid how it happens and they mobilise stupidly slowly",
            "I kinda feel like those may be the pirates left holding the bag after the others cash out.",
            "Given their current state, I'd rather see a negative trade modifier on a route instead of those annoying morons popping out and being like: \"Oh, we're totally going to sit in this system waiting for a 70k fleet to come and smash us into bits.\n\nThat said, I'd rather have a roaming fleet that acts like a mobile shipyard: the fleet raids a planet, and if it's not stopped it siphons away energy/alloy/mineral/science from the planet and, depending on what it stole, it betters it equipment and even leadership and moves to another planet until stopped. Maybe put in an event in which a pirate fleet that is sufficiently advanced and numerous and has raided unopposed for very long actually occupies a planet and becomes an independent criminal syndicate megacorp.",
            "My solution is a mod that disables the whole mechanic",
            "Piracy reduces trade income before the actual fleet appears. I think the fleet is supposed to represent piracy getting so bad that the navy has to deploy to deal with it.\n\nHaving to chase pirate fleets would indeed be as annoying as chasing enemy fleets of only a few ships that roam around during wars. But being able to trigger fleets through espionage could actually be useful. So long as you remember the A.I. can do it to you as well, and it gets resource bonuses on higher difficulties that would probably negate the effects of the pirates (it certainly negates the A.I.'s horrible planet building).",
            "If your playing wide you could just have one of your fleets split up and reform in during a war. Also I feel like it would balance out with wide and tall because each system is worth a lot less in terms of energy credits when you have more systems",
            "If the fleets growth speed is based on the total trade in the system that would be really interesting. Critical trade lanes attract many pirates quickly whilst less important lanes might go ignored slowly growing until they are big enough that the piracy spreads to nearby systems.",
