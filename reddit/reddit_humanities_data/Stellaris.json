Looking for suggestions for a build because I have no imagination of my own :)\n\nI picked Stellaris back up a month before MA release.  Here's a some details on the plays (successful or otherwise) I have done.\n\n-Under One Rule - absolutely dominate with vassals + military federation\n\n-Basic machine ascensions with the new ones from MA for example the unity rush + virtual\n\n-Pop growth plantoid cybernetic + galactic nemesis (didn't like this one as much)\n\n-Driven Assimilators (pre MA release).  I love these guys.\n\n-Rogue Servitor (pre MA release)",

Using the ascension that lowers plant empire size modifier by 50% and technophage. Should I stop getting colonies at this point?",
            "Coming back after over a year break. Playing with one friend, and wanting to do something I haven\u2019t tried before. That is play as lithoid, try to gain vassals, and go psionic. Would it be better to pick the Teachers of the shroud origin or the one where you yeet asteroids to colonize? I plan on choosing the covenant of the strands as it helps with pop growth. Any tips or suggestions would help!",
            "Need help getting a Shattered Ring Machine non-trade focused Megacorp empire off the ground, but starting with -30ish energy deficit right off the bat has been really hard for me to combat. I do think part of my issue is wanting to colonize the other two parts as soon as I can instead of waiting until after I've colonized a planet to get generator districts going."

        "content": "I keep seeing many high-level players talk about never employing worker jobs, which seems sensible: food from starbases, energy from traders, minerals from... well, where DO the minerals come from?\n\nI've seen guides that say your first few planets should be research, forge, factory, etc. with generator districts on them but, uh, where are all the minerals to support the forge and factory worlds??? Those suckers require a LOT of minerals, and you can only buy around 42 minerals per month before the price starts skyrocketing to unreasonable levels, and that's only enough to finance like.. 3 or 4 industrial districts. Nowhere near enough if you need alloys AND cg. Of course you can offset that by selling excess consumer goods and food but it'll keep rising basically forever and eventually get to an unsustainable level. Is there some kind of trick to all this I don't know about? The easy answer is vassalization of course but that requires you to be a decent amount of years into the game, as well as having already financed a very large fleet, which then creates a chicken or the egg problem. Am I missing something obvious or do people just make mineral worlds and not talk about it?\n\nEdit: sorry, i should have specified the main issue is early game before you can start taxing vassals or making arc furnaces!",

            "Probably grand admiral players making vassals pay them basic resources.\n\nU can milk a lot from vassals late game. Barely even need mining worlds. Tho i play heavily modded now. Idk what vanillas like any more since 3.9 for GA",

            "You can get plenty of minerals from space, especially with Astro-Mining Drones civic, arc furnaces and a cybrex mining hub if you're lucky enough to get it.\n\nAlternatively,  you can be a Worker Cooperative and convert trade value into minerals and food.",
            "- Space. Especially wide empires typically have lots of space with mining stations, and there are lots of techs and traditions to boost that.\n\n- Vassals. If you are meta gaming, vassals are the way to go.\n\n- Galactic market. It\u2019s often profitable to buy minerals, press them into alloys, then sell.\n\n- Trade. You can trade ten rare resources for hundreds of raw resources",
            "Ai gets absurd bonus for basic production if you can get only a little bit of this ressources you have enough to be worker free. Second Idea Trade heavy empires get consumer goods from trade and can funnel all the minerals from space station in to alloys or buy more. Notabally you dont use the clerk jobs because they are grbage only the specalist and leader variations. So they answer is space station market and some districts till you get your first vassals",

            "As a tall plantoid megacorporation with catalytic processing, mining stations, vassal contracts, and galactic market trades when necessary. I find I am almost always in a massive surplus of minerals.",
            "It's kindof a shame the game is like this IMO. Like a ton of the games bonuses synergies and flavour are set up as if workers and specialists are both equally important parts of your economy, or at least in a similar ballpark. But there's just so many things that make this not the case.\n\nThe most obvious is vassal taxing (shaped by the AI overusing workers a tad) but there's also the fact that the planetary specialisation bonus reduces minerals needed for CGs and alloys and the fact that % buffs to CG/alloy output mena you need less minerals per CG/alloy than you did before aaaaand there's the fact that you can get a tone of minerals and energy from space but comparatively far less alloys and no CGs.\n\nThere's a lot stacked up all making specialists and synergies with them faaar more important to your economy.\n\nI kinda wish buffs to CGs and alloys got the same treatment many research buffs got, where the upkeep and output scale together. The buffs would still be valuable as it would let each specialist process more material per month, but it would mean that % buffs didn't make you produce alloys with less and less minerals as you got deeper into the game. Might stop the massive relevency dropoff workers have and make things like mining guilds more meaningful."
