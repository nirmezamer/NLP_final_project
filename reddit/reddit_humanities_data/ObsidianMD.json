[Iconic](https://github.com/gfxholo/iconic) is a desktop & mobile friendly plugin for customizing a variety of icons around your vault.\n\n[You can choose any of Obsidian's built-in icons, or an emoji if you prefer that style](https://preview.redd.it/bryr0qyty28d1.jpg?width=1948&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3427493ad2e5b0e26f5200804cc8147dd4ce7bba)\n\nIt expands on the idea of similar plugins like [Iconize](https://florianwoelki.github.io/obsidian-iconize/) and [MAKE.md](http://MAKE.md) by letting you sprinkle icons on almost everything *around* the editor. Everything in the screenshot above is native, so no icon packs are needed.\n\n[Colors can adjust automatically to your CSS theme \ud83c\udf08](https://preview.redd.it/5o5a78swh38d1.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7b978364243257c62b8bb14a1be8e0fb533300e)\n\n**Supported items:**\n\n* Tabs\n* Files & Folders\n* Bookmarks & Groups\n* Properties\n* Ribbon commands\n* Sidebar toggles\n* Help & Settings buttons\n* (Tablets) Pin buttons\n\n**Installation:** [**How to install this plugin using BRAT**](https://github.com/gfxholo/iconic#how-to-install)\n\nHopefully I can get this approved for the community browser soon. This is the first plugin I've shared online, so any critiques and feedback are welcome :)",

I see the option for the accent colour or a personalised one, but not the same as the text.\n\n2. With Iconize you can use :LiIconName: to insert an icon in the editor. Have you considered supporting that?",

Any plans on incorporating [Rainbow Folders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/main/assets/gh-rainbow-preview.webp) like the top theme, [AnuPPuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) has?\n\nI'm asking because a plugin is needed to remedy a huge issue the theme has, which is the colors of the folders change as you scroll in the navigation sidebar.\n\nThis is due to the limitations of CSS, where you can only target n-th childs in the navigation bar with a theme, and since Obsidian constantly loads and unloads items in the navbar as you scroll, the folders change color as well.\n\nA plugin is needed to ensure the colors don't change, but unfortunately I haven't found one, even though a ton of people would use it, the rainbow folders is one of the biggest reasons why the theme is among the top downloaded ones.",

I can be in a meeting, tap something down and it isn\u2019t as intrusive as the laptop or tablet. \n\nThird, the pomodoro timer plugin writes to my daily log file and I can see that I\u2019ve accomplished things.

I found printing the Daily Log with time blocks, to a PDF then printer helps me stay on task. Teachers can end up in 3 conversations at once \u2014 with emails coming in , texts, and students in front of you. The Notion PDF wasn\u2019t very nice. Imagine promising a student to write a recommendation letter but not writing it down. Ugh. I\u2019ve seen it happen to students. \n\nFifth, the community plugins improved my workflow this week. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll continue but I actually have time to be on Reddit. :) \n\nThere are more, but you get the idea. Four years of Notion was enough.",

The export for Notion just bundles things up into a massive .zip file (but it seems to loose some data, and it's impossible to work with because Notion (purposely?) makes all the file names ridiculously long.\n\nI am very happy since transitioning to Obsidian. The syncing isn't as good. It's not as pretty. But it's a better writing experience.

It\u2019s hard to paste the link after you create the brackets etc. and on Notion it\u2019s like a dialog with an input (just like the Reddit app).\n\nAlso the fact that Notion has an interface where you see the end formatting while you write is sort of more pleasant for me.\n\nIf there\u2019s a way to fix these issues in Obsidian with plugins that work on mobile I\u2019d like to know, cause then I\u2019d prefer to move away from Notion if I could."
