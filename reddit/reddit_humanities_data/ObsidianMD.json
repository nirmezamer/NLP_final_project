            "If you haven\u2019t installed it yet, I suggest using the linter plugin",
            "FYI: Editing toolbar leaves a lot of fragments behind. Colors, indentation, justification, alignment, etc, and other formatting is done in HTML.",
            "It looks complex but here is some [info and instructions.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/05/dont-be-afraid.html)",
            "One understandable reason some people are hesitant to use community plugins is the fear that the plain text data they've worked hard to create will be altered, negatively affecting the portability of their notes, one of Obsidian's most attractive features. That's a wise attitude to take for plugins that affect data, but what about plugins that just make Obsidian easier to use? What's the reason for not trying those? These 10 plugins don't leave any code fragments in your notes. They just make Obsidian better.\n\n## 1. [Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander)\n\nCommander lets you add and remove commands from the Obsidian interface. I use it to create ribbon bar buttons for shortcuts that add content to my daily note and to run the Linter plugin on demand. Commander can also edit commands, hide commands and for sync customers, choose what devices commands appear on.\n\n## 2. [Editing Toolbar](https://github.com/cumany/obsidian-editing-toolbar)\n\nEven for seasoned Markdown writers, having access to an editing toolbar can come in handy for doing things like indenting or unindenting text. It also has very handy undo/redo buttons, superscript and subscript buttons and convenient color pickers for text and highlights. Inserting code blocks or inline code is also a breeze.\n\n## 3. [File Explorer++](https://github.com/kelszo/obsidian-file-explorer-plus)\n\nOne of the most frequently asked questions on Reddit is how to manually order folders and files. This simple plugin lets you both pin and hide folders and files with a click in the file menu.\n\n## 4. [Mononote](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote)\n\nAnother simple but useful plugin is Mononote, by the same developer who created the super useful Actions for Obsidian, Mac and iOS shortcuts enhancer. Mononote does one thing, it keeps you from having multiple copies of the same note open at once. If you ever looked at your tab bar and seen multiple copies of your daily note staring at you, install this plugin to prevent that from ever happening again.\n\n## 5. [Note Refactor](https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian)\n\nNote Refactor helps you split and extract content from your current notes. If you've clipped a long web article and you want to break it down into smaller more easily digestible atomic notes, Note Refactor is the tool you want. You can preselect the location where you want your notes to go and even chose a naming convention for them.\n\n## 6. [Plugin Update Tracker](https://github.com/swar8080/obsidian-plugin-update-tracker)\n\nI'm not the least bit ashamed to admit that I run between 50-60 plugins in my vault at any one time. Plugin Update Tracker lets me know at a glance if I have any updates and to what plugins. It will let me read the release notes and even wait a specified number days before notifying me when updates become available so that the early adopters can get the kinks worked out. If there are plugins you wish to ignore updates from, you can do that too.\n\n## 7. [Read It Later](https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater)\n\nReadItLater collects information from your clipboard and creates notes based on the type of content you have saved there. Videos from YouTube, Billibilli, TikTok and Vimeo will be displayed in an inline iFrame based on the clipboard URL. Mastodon toots and URLs will be imported as complete notes generated from nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. It's one of the easiest ways to get web content in your blog. For plain text, the entire clipboard will be used to create a new note.\n\n## 8. [Recent Files](https://github.com/tgrosinger/recent-files-obsidian)\n\nThis plugin displays a list of most recently opened files in the sidebar. Optionally include paths of files which should be excluded from the list. That's it. but it's something I use every single day.\n\n## 9. [Tag Folder](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfolder)\n\nI use Tag Folder primarily to do one thing, show me which notes I have forgotten to tag. It will, of course show your tags as folders and even let you create time-based virtual tags for one hour, six hours, 3 days, 7 days and older than 7 days. You can configure ignored tags and folders if you want to.\n\n## 10. [Tag Wrangler](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler)\n\nI use this plugin to keep my tags clean. It makes it easy to correct typos (mis-spellings) and capitalization errors."
