            "Technically his sentence separates Seinfeld from the early 2000's. But it was still all over in the early 2000's, syndicated and stuff. I was born in 88 and watched a ton of Seinfeld on TV as a teen. As did anyone my age, I'm sure. Dreamcast and Crazy Taxi were before the 2000s as well, but whatever.",

Given the issues from a site-wide level that I don't agree with, personal obligations, and the direction the content posted here over the past year, this blackout has made me reconsider whether I want to moderate the subreddit. At this point, I would rather have someone else moderate the subreddit and just be another fan who wants to enjoy his Crazy Taxi series.\n\nSince I am the most active \"mod\" (This sub has pretty lax moderation) here with other either leaving or just not active, new moderators are needed here. If you want to be the change (or steady momentum) that guides the subreddit feel free to leave a comment below stating the following:\n\n* How long have you been a fan of Regular Car Reviews?\n* How long have you been on reddit for?\n* Any existing moderation experience on reddit?\n\nI will pick 2 new moderators at the end of the week on the 23rd or 24th.\n\nEDIT: In the process of removing inactive moderators and then will send out the moderator requests.",
