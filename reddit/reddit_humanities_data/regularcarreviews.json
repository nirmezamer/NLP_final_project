            "I have some 20-something employees that never know references from the early 2000s or even Seinfeld\u2026 but they fucking knew Crazy Taxi very well!",

            "Technically his sentence separates Seinfeld from the early 2000's. But it was still all over in the early 2000's, syndicated and stuff. I was born in 88 and watched a ton of Seinfeld on TV as a teen. As did anyone my age, I'm sure. Dreamcast and Crazy Taxi were before the 2000s as well, but whatever.",

        "content": "With the end of the blackout here, I personally feel I am no longer able to be in a position to moderate the subreddit. Given the issues from a site-wide level that I don't agree with, personal obligations, and the direction the content posted here over the past year, this blackout has made me reconsider whether I want to moderate the subreddit. At this point, I would rather have someone else moderate the subreddit and just be another fan who wants to enjoy his Crazy Taxi series.\n\nSince I am the most active \"mod\" (This sub has pretty lax moderation) here with other either leaving or just not active, new moderators are needed here. If you want to be the change (or steady momentum) that guides the subreddit feel free to leave a comment below stating the following:\n\n* How long have you been a fan of Regular Car Reviews?\n* How long have you been on reddit for?\n* Any existing moderation experience on reddit?\n\nI will pick 2 new moderators at the end of the week on the 23rd or 24th.\n\nEDIT: In the process of removing inactive moderators and then will send out the moderator requests.",

            "> the direction the content posted here over the past year\n\nis it the one person posts hey I like this random song from 1997 what car would I drive and then for the next 3 days its 20 posts just like it \n\ncuz i dont like that either",
            ">How long have you been a fan of Regular Car Reviews?\n\nSince the very early days, when they used ska songs as intros. \n\n>How long have you been on reddit for?\n\n11 years. Too long. \n\n>Any existing moderation experience on reddit?\n\nI ran an undertale porn subreddit for a little bit as a joke. This alone should qualify me. I feel as though it's directly in the spirit of the channel. \n\nI don't really know how to \"run\" a sub, but i'm on here often enough that I could cull garbage posts and keep people from running the sub into the ground. If someone else wants to be head mod and actually make rules that's fine. I giggle enough at the posts on here that I'd love to help keep the place nice.",
            "- Been a fan since about 2014.\n\n- Been on Reddit since 2013, on other accounts. \n\n- Yes to mod experience on Reddit, though on smaller subs that didn't take off. Mod experience on larger online forums, though.",
            "> How long have you been a fan of Regular Car Reviews?\n\nSince 2013. I've been an avid watcher since I accidentally stumbled upon RCR's 1997 Ram review, and I rewatched the Avenger review so much I accidentally memorized it line for line. I've also been really active in r/regularcarreviews since 2016. One of my comments even made it to the end of the review for Tavarish's Aston.\n\n> How long have you been on reddit for?\n\nSince 2012. 2 weeks shy of my 11-year cake day as of today.\n\n> Any existing moderation experience on reddit?\n\nI have been a moderator of r/totallynotrobots (405K+ members) since 2017, so I know a thing or two about moderating a fairly large subreddit.",
            "Been a fan since 2019\nReddit since 2017\n\nOnly r/Miataforscale, not very large or active\n\n\ni\u2019m a pretty good fit \ud83d\ude0e",

            "* I have been a fan of RCR for 7 years, according to youtube at least.\n* I've used Reddit since 2014, although this is one of my newer accounts.\n* I used to mod r/MakeMyCoffin, but it did get deleted during the massive Reddit ban wave of 2020. I did also mod r/ActualPublicFreakouts. I stepped away from Reddit during the pandemic. \n* I'm free on weekdays, 5am-4pm est. Then evenings from about 6-9pm est. Generally free all weekends.\n* I live really close to RCR irl, so if he or Roman ever need anything, I'm around.",
            "I've been a fan of Regular Car Reviews for about 6 months, however I first discovered his Honda Fit video in 2021 when I was considering buying one. I have also been into cars since I was 2 years old!\n\nMy current reddit account is from 2019 but I've had accounts dating back to 2012.\n\nI once got added as a mod for a subreddit about an obscure lost song (not TMMS).\n\nAlso, like Mr. Regular, I happen to be part of the LGBTQIA+ community, since I am a transgender woman!\n\nTherefore, I believe I am most qualified to be a new mod on this subreddit. If any of you have any questions, then feel free to ask! Looking forward to being the next mod!"
