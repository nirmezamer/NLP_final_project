Tools that no longer work because they were made for SSC have been replaced with the tools that were made for workday (see the **\"Survive Workday\"** section). We also updated the FAQ and important reminders section with information that has come up frequently.\n\nIf you think something should be included on this page or this post, please send us a modmail or use one of the other contribution options.\n\n## 2. Enforcing Megathread\n\nWorkday and registration questions are now being reported as spam or duplicates. We are going to start sending most of the workday related questions to this megathread.\n\nThis should clean things up and create one place for people to answer questions. This thread will be sorted by new, and we are open to adding relevant information to this post or the wiki page. See above.\n\nIf you think something belongs in a top level post, such as a PSAs about an issue you discovered, let us know!\n\n---\n\nPrevious threads:\n\n- [Workday Woes Megathread #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1cxyyoq)\n- [All Caps Rage Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1cxyxin)",

Its not even like I'm trying to register for the course in the same term as its pre-req, I don't see why this is an issue other than workday being a piece of shit.\n\nHow am I supposed to register for this course if I can't even make one worklist with it?
