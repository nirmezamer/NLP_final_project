        "content": "It has come to our attention that outside of the basics (voting, how to report, posting/commenting), many people are still in the dark as to how exactly Reddit works regarding moderation and Admins.\n\nFirstly, moderators, like us, only have power (a limited scope at that) and jurisdiction over the subreddits we mod and what happens on them. We cannot do anything about what happens outside of here. We don\u2019t have a direct line of access to Reddit Admins, who control and oversee the site as a whole. In fact, we can only do the same things y\u2019all can do in trying to get their attention on things: report it and wait. We, like you, often don\u2019t get responses from admins regarding their decisions or even if they have viewed any reports we send in. We are the same in that capacity. Subreddit bans only prevent people from posting and commenting on the subreddit they were banned in for however long the ban is for. You can still vote in and view subreddits you are banned in. We can\u2019t even see who reports what.\n\nAdmins are like gods of Reddit. They oversee all; they can see who votes what, who views what, who reports what, everything. They can suspend people from the website as a whole which prohibits someone from posting, commenting, and even voting on the entirety of Reddit for however long said suspension lasts. They can even suspend specific IP addresses from users who keep making accounts and breaking Reddit sitewide rules.\n\nHere\u2019s an analogy: Reddit Admins are the Roman Gods and we moderators are like members of the Roman Senate or mayors of towns. Members of the Roman Senate don\u2019t have a direct link or direct way to communicate to the Roman Gods; they have to make offerings and prayers just like everyone else to try to catch their attention. It\u2019s the same here. All we mods can do is make reports just like you all and hope someone looks at it. We can do nothing about what happens to you outside of Rome (the subreddit). That\u2019s up to the admins.\n\nWe are also bound by the Reddit Mod Code of Conduct as well to nip any activity that breaks, or could be interpreted as breaking, Reddit Content Policy in the bud. Due to this subreddit having been previously in trouble with admins because of the founder not doing these things and getting booted and admin putting us 3 in place as new mods over a year ago with the express statement of \u201cwe will be watching you closely\u201d, we really don\u2019t take any chances when it comes to people breaking Content Policy. We just can\u2019t risk it because that means we could be actioned and the subreddit could be sanctioned or shut down. We prioritize the community as a whole over any personal feelings we or others might have; that\u2019s just how it has to work for this community to thrive and survive.\n\nThe proper course of action for when something happens to you or you see something that breaks sitewide rules (also referred to as Content Policy) is to report it to the admins via [www.reddit.com/report](http://www.reddit.com/report) and wait. Trying to call others out publicly technically breaks Reddit Content Policy under the harassment rule no matter the reason, and like we said above, we can\u2019t allow it due to the ramifications it can have on the subreddit as a whole even if we personally agree what happened was messed up and the other person should be held accountable in some way.\n\nMoreover, do not create or use an alt account to participate in a subreddit you have been banned in on another account. Reddit tracks this and views it as ban evasion which is prohibited as it is community interference (you were banned which means they don\u2019t want you participating there for whatever reason is outlined in your ban message). You should contact the mods on the account you were banned on to see if you can get unbanned by demonstrating accountability and understanding of how you broke the rules and a willingness to follow the rules. \n\n\\---- Relevant Links ----\n\nContent Policy: [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)\n\nWhat even IS brigading?: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/cmp9uy/comment/ew4lpf0/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/cmp9uy/comment/ew4lpf0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nMod Code of Conduct, so you all are aware of the rules we as mods have to follow as well: [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct)\n\nRedditor Help Center for any further questions: [https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/p/redditor\\_help\\_center](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/p/redditor_help_center)\n\n\\--- Personal Note ---\n\nThis post is locked because I have classes and am pretty busy irl except on weekends, I know I won\u2019t have the spoons to answer questions personally, and tbh sometimes notifications really overwhelm me when I\u2019m already stressed out which is why I provided the links /gen. This post was made in response to the subreddit growing and us becoming more aware of the fact many people do not know these things and just assume moderators are also Admins of Reddit as a whole or have way more power than we actually do. We don\u2019t. In the eyes of Admin, we are basically volunteer clean-up crew and are the same level of importance as a regular user on Reddit. We don\u2019t get paid, we don\u2019t get any extra benefits or anything either (as it should be imo, mod out of love for the community not because of anything else). Admins are employees of Reddit that get paid for working and only work on the clock then go do whatever they want off it. We moderate on and off all day; in between our actual jobs, chores, and life responsibilities. I hope this helps clear some things up for anyone confused as to what the differences are between mods and Admins and provides people with a way to research more about how Reddit works on their own as well. \u2665\n\nEdit because I forgot: If you do have any questions or anything you're still confused about please modmail us via the \"message the mods\" button on the sidebar and someone will answer it when they can \u2665",

        "content": "[LONG POST SORRY] \n\nI\u2019m not sure when this started, but there seems to be some confusion about the views of this subreddit. Trans women are women. They are obviously not *just* allowed but **welcome** to be here and participate here. \u201cAFAB\u201d is a blanket term used because even if someone doesn\u2019t currently identify as a woman, they are still not a cis man and likely have gone through things specific to being autistic but not an autistic cis man; as we all know autistic cis men tend to be treated differently than women with autism, genderqueer people with autism, trans people with autism, etc. This subreddit is for **people with autism that are not cis men** aka women (both trans and cis), anyone Assigned Female at Birth, intersex people (intersex means a person born with both male and female sexual characteristics), etc. This list is in no particular order and is not all encompassing. \n\nThings are not as black and white as \u201cif you use AGAB terminology you\u2019re excluding trans women and are saying that they are less valid and that everything boils down to biology\u201d. That is not what we were ever saying or meant to say and I\u2019m sorry if anyone thought that. The terminology used is only used to say \u201ceveryone that isn\u2019t a cis man is welcome here\u201d but perhaps we should change the subreddit description to say that. (Edit: I changed it) \n\nIMO, the divide between \u201cmale\u201d autism and \u201cfemale\u201d autism is kind of bogus. Autism is autism and it presents in a variety of ways. The presentation may change based on how you were raised and socialized as a child, but idk if sex plays a role in it at all outside of hormones and societal norms. \n\nFor example, I myself have been described as having \u201cmore traditionally male autism\u201d. My reaction to that was to ask \u201cwtf is \u2018male\u2019 autism it\u2019s just autism\u201d and was told that because I\u2019m not as good at masking and have more trouble socializing with others I have more \u201cmale\u201d autism. I didn\u2019t say anything after that and just let the person that diagnosed me ramble on while thinking about how bullshit that sounded. Apparently being less able to mask, having more difficulties socializing, and having higher support needs makes me have \u201cmale\u201d autism in the eyes of medical professionals. \n\nBut I digress. Personal anecdote aside, **this subreddit is for everyone with autism that is not a cis man**. People are allowed to use AGAB terminology for themselves but are not allowed to use it to exclude others. I\u2019m sorry if anyone felt excluded but literally none of us mods knew because no one brought it up to us in modmail and we do have lives and responsibilities outside of the internet as well as our own struggles going on that can keep us offline for longer periods of time. Please have some empathy and understanding for your fellow autists and do not expect perfection or people to know what you know just implicitly. Some of us have to be told things to know them and don\u2019t understand without it being explained to us. Like me. You need to explain things to me before accusing me of something I don\u2019t even understand. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this doesn\u2019t make much sense. I\u2019m trying to work on my communication better but as many people here will relate to, there seems to be a disconnect between what\u2019s in my brain and what I can get out either verbally or through text. I only mean this post to be sincere in tone but I do admit I am tired of seeing false assumptions about this subreddit elsewhere on Reddit and this one is the one that kills me the most since I myself am not cisgender I identify as autigender (gender identity shaped through the lense of autism link: https://stimpunks.org/2022/09/25/autigender-and-neuroqueer-two-words-on-the-relationship-between-autism-and-gender-that-fit-me/) which is under the NB/trans umbrella. \n\nIf anyone is curious or confused or just has questions or comments or concerns I\u2019ll answer as I can in the comments but I only ask that you ask me clarifying questions before making assumptions and please do not just assume I know something. I am very open to education and correction as long as it is done in a non-attacking manner. My main goal here is to better myself so I can better moderate this subreddit to be as welcoming and inclusive as possible to non-cis men with autism regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. \n\nSending positive energy to anyone that has read this and much love to the community we have here /gen \u2665\ufe0e\n\nEdit: Locking this post now as I don\u2019t really have the mental energy or full cognitive capacity to reply to comments anymore I hope you all can understand that and thank you for the valuable discussion and information. If you have any book recommendations or helpful things like that you can make a post about it as I think it would be valuable to all. For conversations that were abruptly cut short I\u2019m sorry. But again, thank you all for the valuable feedback \u2665\ufe0e /gen",

            "In a book I was reading is pointed out that what we often view as female autism can also often be seen in cis men from marginalized groups. So for instance a black man might be able to relate to masked autistic characteristics and also have to code switch on top of that. That being said, its important for cis and trans women from all backgrounds, as well as gender nonconforming folks to have safe spaces, and those who follow intersectional feminism have a long history of providing those inclusive spaces.",

            "This is just a grammar nitpick, nothing about the content, but the current phrasing \"centered around non-cis men with autism\" does grammatically read as \"centered around men (who are non-cis) with autism.\" I think the easiest change would be \"those other than cis men\" or something similar, but there's probably other better ways to phrase it that the mods will land on after discussing amongst themselves.",
            "I'm old (no, really) and confused with all the genders and (non) binary stuff. All I want to say is: if you think you belong here, you're more than welcome: \"One of us! One of us!\"",
            "Yeah, I've (afab nonbinary) been coming here for a little while now, and you've all been very welcoming. This has mostly felt like a safe space. Some posts I don't relate to, but there are things that I do, and that's when I feel free to engage, otherwise, I just mind my business. The \"girl gamers\" subreddit is another space I visit and sometimes relate to. It's because as afab and trans people, we share some lived experiences that amab cis men don't. Point is, we're all human and all share some lived experiences, but gendered socialisation and external perceptions of us do play a huge role in how we experience life as well.",

Overwhelming this subreddit has proven to be trans inclusive and I'm so glad it is staying that way",

He has had access to help and has refused it 90% of the time. \n\nHe might not chose to have poor emotional regulation skills but he chooses to curse us out over the smallest things. Today he yelled at me because I asked him if he ate my cookies. The man is nearly 70 years old and he's screaming telling me to fuck off over cookies. He makes me feel like I'm speaking to an overgrown child. I know he's got some control over this because he has never, ever acted like this in the presence of a man. Only to women. If he truly wasn't in control of himself he would act like this around everyone. \n\nI can't wait to leave because I can't do this anymore. I'm so sick of society enabling this behavior.

Sending you all the good vibes because Ive been there and just really feel for you right now. ",
