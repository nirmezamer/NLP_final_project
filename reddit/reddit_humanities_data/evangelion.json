            "Adding because it seems some people still don\u2019t know this, but Gainax do not currently own Evangelion. Anno got the rights back and they are held under his studio Khara.",
            "Tbh figures. They haven't made anything substantive in a decade.\n\nSad to see though.",
            "There\u2019s a reason why Anno left that studio",
            "I thought they were already gone, honestly can\u2019t think of anything they\u2019ve made since Gurren Laggan",
            "Let\u2019s hope this means Khara now own the rights to all the properties GAINAX were still holding onto.",
            "The husk is finally being taken off life support.",
            "My first thought was: Didn't they go bankrupt AGES ago?",
            "I mean they've bled off all their major talent, lost a majority of their biggest IPs, hasn't really done anything of major substance in the past 10 years, and their CEO is now facing jail time for trying to sexually exploit an up and coming VA.\n\nIt was only basically inevitable at this point.",

            "Twin peaks still cultural classic and NGE was extremely popular before EoE too.",
            "I liked the original ending. Not to be edgy.",
            "I still loved the show, but I consider EoE just top-class cinema. It\u2019s very of it\u2019s time, right there with other dark 90s mindfuck movies like Fight Club and Being John Malcovich and Eternal Sunshine and Vanilla Sky. It\u2019s the peak culmination of everything the show was striving to be by its end, and I think the final shot is rivaled only by There Will Be Blood for best final shot in a movie. I never really considered it before, but even though I would have loved Eva with or without EoE, I probably wouldn\u2019t have revisited it year after year throughout my life.",
            "I don't know about reputation, what i can say is that i would love the series anyways",
            "I love the original ending too tbh",
            "I watched Neon Genesis way back in the day, when the official US DVDs were first coming out. Must\u2019ve been 2000 or so. I was completely unaware of the existence of EoE at the time, and so I can tell you my thoughts on the series having watched the 26 TV episodes with no knowledge or context from EoE\n\nI def enjoyed the beginning of the series and was excited to see where it was going. Middle was great, and I was absolutely enthralled by the downward desperate spiral of the characters in the home stretch. \n\nThen I watched eps 25 and 26. I don\u2019t know, I guess I thought they were fairly interesting from the angle of subversion of expectations. And the psychological existential explorations were fascinating. But I definitely felt a little let down after the incredible buildup of that home stretch. It wasn\u2019t clear from what I saw that they had a plan at all on how to wrap up the series.\n\nMaybe half a year to a year later, me and a buddy were trying to find some weekend watching material in a local video store, when we came across a couple of interesting VHS tapes, entitled End of Evangelion, and Death and Rebirth. We had both been fans of the series, if a little underwhelmed by how it was wrapped up. Was this a continuation? Some kind of summary, or knockoff? The art looked legit, and our curiosity was piqued. We picked those tapes up for our weekend watching.\n\nWe randomly picked End of Evangelion to watch first. My buddy and I were completely gobsmacked. After \u201ckimouchi warui\u201d, then black screen, we sat there in stunned silence for minutes, trying to get our minds around what we\u2019d just witnessed. When we were finally able to talk it was of the HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK DID WE JUST WATCH variety, giddiness and awe and confusion and elation over just having our minds blown by something unlike anything we\u2019d ever seen before. I can honestly say that my original watching of EoE was one of the most impactful cinematic experiences I\u2019ve ever had. 24ish years later and nothing has topped that for me.\n\nMany, MANY rewatches of the series and movie later, I can say that I do quite like the TV episodes 25 and 26. They are part of the wholly unique texture of the series, and it wouldn\u2019t be the same without them. However, if EoE never existed? Eh. I expect I would have still quite enjoyed NGE for what it was, but wouldn\u2019t have seen it nearly as many times, or remembered the series with nearly the fondness that I have for it now. End of Evangelion is goat, and unquestionably puts the series as a whole in my highest echelon of esteemed cinema experiences.\n\nTake all of this as you will. Everyone\u2019s tastes are different, and many would have still loved the series. But personally I don\u2019t think the series would be quite the timeless icon it is now, without the incredible conclusion that is EoE.",
            "I think the legacy would have a bad taste lingering, like \"yeah the series was great and it's a classic and the ending was really bold but the animation quality drop off of the last two episodes is noticeable and the ending still leaves people upset and disappointed to this day.\" \n\nKind of like how dark souls discussion comes down to \"it's a classic, one of the most important games ever made, but the last few areas are really low quality.\"",
            "the original ending is good but still feels kind of incomplete. eoe is probably one of the best movies of the 90s.",
            "the newer audience, which would have joined the series later on, would have been so confused about the ending \n\nalso anno decided to make the rebuild when he was rewatching end of evangelion, so we can say that the rebuild then would had a different end",
            "Disappointing and a wildly frustrating watch. All that build up, the character's journeys, the action, the world-ending threats, the parental abuse and teenage trauma, the hot penguin action, the beer and watermelons, the stunted clones, the contemplation of individuality, all ending with a clapping circle."
