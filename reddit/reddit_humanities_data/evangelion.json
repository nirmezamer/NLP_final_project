            "Adding because it seems some people still don\u2019t know this, but Gainax do not currently own Evangelion. Anno got the rights back and they are held under his studio Khara.",
            "Tbh figures. They haven't made anything substantive in a decade.\n\nSad to see though.",
            "There\u2019s a reason why Anno left that studio",
            "I thought they were already gone, honestly can\u2019t think of anything they\u2019ve made since Gurren Laggan",
            "Let\u2019s hope this means Khara now own the rights to all the properties GAINAX were still holding onto.",
            "My first thought was: Didn't they go bankrupt AGES ago?",
            "I mean they've bled off all their major talent, lost a majority of their biggest IPs, hasn't really done anything of major substance in the past 10 years, and their CEO is now facing jail time for trying to sexually exploit an up and coming VA.\n\nIt was only basically inevitable at this point.",
            "I mean that was something that should have happened a while ago",
            "Damn. According to the DeepL translated original article (i cannot read japanese) - they **absolutely** deserved this and made every conceivable effort - in recent years - to make this the *only* course of action for any normal company. \n\nCest la vie and good riddance -I say! No wonder Anno doesnt want to be associated with this...band of crazies any longer.",
            "dont let them enter bankruptcy, last time they did, they fucked our minds"

            "Hmm. Just scored a NGE car window sunscreen. Now I see this, it's time to score another. Thanks for the spreading the evangelic message via parking permit. Only if my vehicle don't end up like yours or Misato's with them damn angels attacking the city.",

            "Man I miss mine. The UV is strong here where I'm at and eventually it just deteriorated to the point where it was crumbling apart."

It will go even worse for you than it is going for grown her. Just a warning, keep it together. Trollololololololol \n\nBy the way, if every character is switched then Yui and Gendo would be dead in the second impact and it would be Misato's Mother in Gendo's place and her father's soul inside the Eva \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

            "Think about it the way it works with the Certain series. Toma is less popular in Index than he is in Railgun. His cameos and chapters are a highlight and people love to see him pop up but it wouldn't happen if the series wasn't the way it is. \n\nIt's the same here. Yeah, it wouldn't work on its own but as a side piece or alt version it'd be fun to see.",
