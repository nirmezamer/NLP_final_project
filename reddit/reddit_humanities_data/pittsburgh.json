Some people can deal with the heat but not the cold (I'm the opposite); some people really want bike infrastructure; some people want/need wheelchair accessibility (which is often lacking in NYC); some people care about public transit and some people care about parking. If you're filthy rich you don't care about the cost of living but you might care more about tax levels.\n\nI totally understand why people post them every time Pittsburgh does relatively well, I love it here and I want my biases confirmed, but there are just as many or more lists where Pittsburgh doesn't even show up. A friend of mine who lives in Irvine, CA shared one recently where Irvine was at the top or close to it. My best guess is that list was written by a car that likes to sit in traffic.",
