Or should I just be hitting the credit/battle data stages? Thanks!",

            "The collectables are a good start, but is there an official reason for not just straight up buffing weaker Nikkes?  \nI would have lost my f2p status (and opend the floodgates for spending >.<) if I had any reason at all to use Folkwang.  \nBut why buy a skin for a Nikke I won't even play?",
