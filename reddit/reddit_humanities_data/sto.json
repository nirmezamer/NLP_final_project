So something changed there? Is the Omega now the one that does it?",
            "Does anyone have experience in \"catching up\" from changing platforms?\n\nI've played on Xbox for the last 5-6 years and geared out my main character really well, lots of currencies with a couple store bought ships, overall really enjoyed my time on Xbox.\n\nBut I've since returned to PC and found my old fleet still playing, and it's been nice just playing with them every day, having people to talk to in-game compared to console. \n\nLooking to just move over permanently now, but.. I feel a bit lost having none of my currencies, BOFFs, admirality or gear etc, so not too sure whether it's going to be painful to catch up, or try something new.",

            "Any idea why the Excalibur class redesign doesn't have phaser arrays at the rear of the ship like the other cruiser variants do? Is it to keep it as close to the original look as possible?"
