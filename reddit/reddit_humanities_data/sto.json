        "content": "[Risian Luxury Cruiser \\(T6\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hsq0bnadnh9d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72329f4c5440c9ff853c7c309fea9c3051b2237b)\n\nWelcome to Eventful, my chronological run through the T6 event ships.\n\nHow it works - using my intentionally modestly equipped level 65 Romulan engineer I scrap together a build and play a ship to complete its mastery doing content no harder than advanced through a mix of patrols and RTFOs.\n\n[Previously I stealthily flew around in the Temer Alliance Raider](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1dpntwa/eventful_ep_21_temer_alliance_raider/).\n\nRounding out our trio of the Risian fleet is the T6 upgrade to one of the few event ships I don't actually have, the [Risian Luxury Cruiser](https://stowiki.net/wiki/Risian_Luxury_Cruiser_(T6)). Doing its best job at cosplaying Flotsam Paradise, the luxury cruiser is our first standard cruiser since the Samsar all those years back. I was rather excited to get this given I missed out on the T5 offering and honestly? Yup, it's a cruiser alright. Still, its name is accurate as this looks like a cruise ship that can fly, but also maybe glide along the water too. Can this thing do atmospheric flight? I have no idea, however let's find out what this simple, yet gorgeous ship can do.\n\n[Generating soliton waves](https://preview.redd.it/fuj4ncemnh9d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ddd8bcff20380e94053d2e7af50e0e931b03580)\n\n*How's the general lay-out?*\n\nUnfortunately this cruiser is pretty routine. Time has been kind to it in the form of isomags coming along and sure, it has the novelty of having decent mobility for a standard cruiser, it's just nothing else is really going in its favour. Compare and contrast with the corvette for instance. Even as a 4/3 escort it carves out a niche as being extraordinarily mobile and that's before getting to the fleet upgrade. Getting a cruiser moving now is not a particularly challenging or expensive task. In fact I'd actually forgotten that the luxury cruiser doesn't have any pilot seating bucking the trend from the other two Risian ships. I'm not entirely sure why it has temp ops either other than to tie it in with the original Risa episode \u201cCaptain's Holiday\u201d. Not that it having pilot seating would've made it utterly unique, just that if it had the same drive towards agility as the other two Risian ships then it probably would've felt more special.\n\nWith a 5/3/3 console lay-out your best bet to pump up its DEW numbers is with the aforementioned isomags. With a commander and ensign engineering it really presents itself as an Auxiliary to Battery ship, giving you those, EPtW3, EPtS/E1 and Engineering Team 1 to cover all your engineering necessities. The LtC Tac is great to empower your beams, but not enough seating if you want to empower more than just those. For me the set Lt Sci is not enough to slot Photonic Officer 2, so the LtC Uni/Temp Ops has to go to sci, annoyingly reducing my tactical options. To try and bring some energy out I wanted to try and slot some Temp Ops abilities despite the desirable Recursive Shearing 1 conflicting with the more urgent PO2. Instead I equipped Channeled Deconstruction and Rapid Decay. Unable to really boost its damage much, CD is there to set up Rapid Decay which I'm using to get a load of damage resistance reduction going. So that's neat. If I did have AtB going, I'd slot the universal with tactical for some KLW and TS along with RS1. Alas.\n\n*Customisation options?*\n\nA boatload. You can freely switch parts with the T5 cruiser to mix-and-match to your delight, along with various windows and the many Risian hull materials and glows. Throw in some wild hull patterns and, well, the randomised selections in the image at the top should give an indication of the kind of things you can do. Funny in a way because though the T6 model and textures are sharper and just generally better, I actually think the T5 version does a better job of selling the luxury cruise idea.\n\n*How's the trait and console?*\n\nMaintaining the general vibe of the ship, Leisurely Pace has you keeping a low throttle in exchange for a stacking EPG and control buff. It's not particularly difficult to obtain and maintain the buff, it's just not super valuable; if you're slotting it because you need those stats in your EPG/control build, your equipment is probably lacking. If you don't need those extra stats, you're more than likely better off slotting something else. There's also a small AoE debuff that adds some extra flavour, but Leisurely Pace absolutely gives off the sense that it's designed as filler until you're, ironically, up to speed with your build as a whole.\n\nThe Enhanced Soliton Wave Generator console, however, is a little more interesting. With a 60 second cooldown as opposed to the usual two minutes and a decent duration where it's active there's a pretty good uptime here. With it doing a decent chunk of radiation damage and having a passive that boosts the critical damage of exotic abilities, I've found this having a home on most of the builds on my science character. All-in-all? Pretty good.\n\n*Any other fun toys?*\n\nAn innate Solar Sail granting increased performance during slipstream to the tune of a slightly faster speed and a longer duration. Hey it's not much, but it is something.\n\n*Overall thoughts...*\n\nI really wish I liked this more than I do. It's fine though. As a platform the LtC Uni/Temp Ops is really its greatest feature to me and ultimately I don't think that's quite enough. By this point we already had the support cruisers, hell we had their legendary versions too, and I think they pre-emptively ate the luxury cruiser's lunch. In some respect I think it's more forgettable than the Samsar, if only because that thing was built to tank whilst this can go a bit fast, sort of. Despite this the console has a place and the trait, whilst no means great, can be useful in a pinch. Ultimately this is a ship where it has tons of style, just not enough anything else to keep it afloat. Boat puns!\n\n*Don't all the Risian consoles form a set?*\n\nThey sure do. The 2pc will grant you bonus engine power and EPG and control stats which is certainly not bad, whilst the 3pc is...unique. Your pilot bridge abilities recover 10% quicker which, I mean, I guess it's better than nothing, but it also makes Rock'n'Roll recover quicker too. I think that actually is pretty neat, though certainly not something I'd want to use as a crutch.\n\n*Next time?*\n\nPicked the renegade option.",
