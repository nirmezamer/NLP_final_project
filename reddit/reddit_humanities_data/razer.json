        "content": "I've recently ditched another popular mice brand for Razer. I'm a wired mouse extremist. I don't want no dongle, no battery to charge, nothing. So I've purchased the Deathadder V3. Fantastic mouse : back to basics, no crappy RGB (another thing I'm becoming more and more extremist about), subdued design, super light, solid, fantastic switches, sensor and firm scrollwheel... It's almost reached perfection... ALMOST !  \n  \nBecause, well, it's a Deathadder and not a Viper and while I have large hands and it fits very well, I do have a preference for tinier fingertip designs and I was very disappointed in Razer that no \"Viper V3\" (non-pro, non-hyperspeed, non-nothing) exists.  \n  \nI hope it's something Razer has planned because I can't believe there aren't other people like me who just prefer good old wired everything on their top end hardware. The pricetag of wireless mice compared to wired alone to me justifies buying wired. The Deathadder V3 is almost a steal in that regard.",

            "Agree, but probably they have to sell the expensive ones first to create cheaper wired version.",
            "If your laptop is experiencing battery issues such as swelling or poor charging, please replace immediately. Razer Blade batteries are very simple to remove, only requiring a few T5 screws for the back panel. Batteries have a shelf-life and degrade with use, heat and charge stress can speed this up and usually need replacing around 3-5 years for laptops. 2022+ Blades have a charge limiter that should be enabled.\n\nFor replacements, contact Razer support first, battery warranty is 2 years and outside of warranty they can sell to some regions. eBay and iFixit also have replacements, check your model and year.\n\n[SpicyPillow FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows/comments/gebotv/faq_what_to_do_if_you_have_a_swollen_battery/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "Yeah at first I didn't realize how new the Viper V3 series is. \"Bad\" purchase timing on my part ;)  \n  \nI strongly hope they add a wired top end Viper. If it's priced similarly to the Deathadder (no reason not to be) I'd probably consider buying it. Keeping both mice for a big 1v1 comparison and eventually selling the loser.\n\nI've quit team \"G\" after so many mice/keyboards since in my eyes the build quality went down and the price to perf ratio and also the design language didn't speak to me anymore. I'm glad to see Razer coming up with such clean no-nonsense mice. Here's me hoping they take notice :)"
