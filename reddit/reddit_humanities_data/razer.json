            "I am using Razer Basilisk V3. Sometimes, my mouse connects/disconnects rapidly for several seconds, acts like left click is pressed for the duration of disconnects/connects, and after those several seconds everything is back to normal. How can I fix that? Mouse is pretty new, used for about a month or so.\n\nAlso, I've been using Razer Mamba Elite before, and I've never had this problem.",
            "I am currently using a Razer BlackWidow V4 75% keyboard. I  am having an issue where many  of my keys are double  typing unless I click them super fast. I have uninstalled Razer Synapse completely and I  am still having issues. I'm also plugged into a USB 3 port and my windows is up to date. This post  alone was a pain to type, please help me with any solutions. Thanks",
            "Razer Basilisk Ultimate: Randomly disconnects for a few seconds, no real apparent reason as to why. Any mouse buttons pressed are treated as pressed until the mouse reconnects.  \n  \nAnother side-issue (maybe not issue but programming bug? idk) is that the mouse's volume up/down binds also press buttons on my keyboard; specifically, vol. up presses B and vol. down presses C. However, this never enters text in text fields, and only appears to work when there is some sort of in-game command bound to one of those buttons. It's very strange...",
            "I have a Naga Classic Mouse, with a 12 pad. \n\nI am having an issue with the side keys sticking and I would like to remove them so that I can clean them. Is there a way to easily remove and then replace the side keys?",

            "I'm having issues with my razer viper v3. When I plug it in to charge and get up for a while, when I come back my mouse doesn't work at all. It seems to be out of sleep mode as it's lighting up, but it never moves the cursor. It seems to be connected to synapse and when I plug it in, the mouse still doesn't work. The only fix I have is completely restarting my pc. Has anyone else had this issue? Is there a simple fix? I'm thinking about returning it as it's very frustrating behavior for such an expensive mouse.",
            "On cold boot (with Windows 11 fast startup disabled) my Deathstalker v2 always comes up with numlock off despite the BIOS set to start with it on. It's an immediate daily nuisance because like most, my Win PIN includes numbers.\n\nOn a soft reboot, it comes up in its previous on/off state. That's a bit better but still ignoring the BIOS setting. Thoughts? Workarounds?",
            "Having an issue with my Blackwidow v3, the volume scroll wheel has changed functions to scrolling instead of volume control without me changing any of my keybindings and I'm not sure how to change it back. \n\nI've tried resetting profiles and making sure it's bound to volume up and down but it still just scrolls. Pressing it still mutes the volume. I can always use my volume control on my Kraken headset, but it is slightly annoying lol. Any help would be greatly appreciated :\\]"

I thought, surely if the edges arent perforated, the glue they used must be really good! And hey its razer, theyre a good brand right?\n\nBruh",
            "Oh, so it seems like I'm not gonna get any help from Razer.. that's terrible. They should discontinue it if it's such a widespread issue. \n\n\nAlternatively, is there any other way I can fix this myself through DIY? Some glues or stuff you recommend?",
