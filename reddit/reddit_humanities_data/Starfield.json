        "content": "Hey gang,\n\nAfter a lot of feedback from the community, we have decided to ban comprehensive review posts from the subreddit. Before you get the pitchforks out, hear us out as to the why.\n\n**First, let's define a comprehensive review post.** It's a post in which the author lays out everything they like and dislike about the game in a manner similar to a media outlet giving a review.\n\n**Okay, so what's so bad about that?** Well, there are a few things. For starters, these posts have been flooding the subreddit and not really doing anything to advance discussion of the game. They're not very actionable for the devs to make changes. And they just get people fighting over the same shit every day.\n\n**But you're censoring our dissent!** No, we're not. We're focusing it. You have a gripe with a particular system in the game? Make a post about that system. Break down what you like and dislike about shipbuilding or NPC interactions or inventory management or power acquisition. THAT post will drive actionable feedback that the devs can use.\n\nIf you still want to pretend you're Paul Tassi and write a 500 word magnum opus on the 10 things you wish you'd known before playing Bethesda's latest game, we recommend starting a blog OR you can just leave it in the comments.\n\nKind regards,\n\nThe /r/Starfield Mod Team",

            "As a note, there was a point where statistically 60% of the posts over a 48 hour period were either long winded reviews consisting of \"I played for 300 hours and....\" \"I love\" or \"I hate\", OR, posts complaining about those types of posts. There was also a lot of \"i don't like that opinion, so I will make a troll post that counters it\". It adds nothing beneficial to the conversation, and just adds to toxic behavior from both sides.\n\nWhen that takes up a majority of the subreddit, people are downvoting a majority of them, and there's a large amount of posts complaining (or....complaining about the complaining?) We decided this was the best option to allow actual content to easier flow through and become visible. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with an opinion, but there are constructive ways to do things, and there are ways that just bait, flame, and create a toxic environment.",

            "**I read this thread for 200+ hours, and my taste has soured.**\n\nAt first, I really enjoyed this thread. It seems well thought out and reasonable. But as I read, something sort of shifted for me. Even when restarting the thread from a new account, nothing changes. Every word is the same, all of the comments feel repetitive. There\u2019s no intrigue, nothing for me to come back and work on.\n\nThere\u2019s no combat because everyone is so agreeable, and the mechanics suck since they ditched third party apps. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good post for the first 100+ hours or so, but after that there\u2019s really nothing to keep coming back to. It makes me feel like I\u2019m wasting my time somehow, like what was the point of spending 4 days reading one thread? Where\u2019s the pay off? What did I even neglect my wife for?\n\nOverall, I\u2019d rate the post a 10/0, much needed and really paving the way for better posts, but I wouldn\u2019t pay $70 for it.",

I could look past the mouth not moving, I'll throw a mask on her and keep it moving. But the quest is a buggy garbage fire with silent dialogue and quest markers leading to nowhere. If you're unsure about what you've produced release it for free.

            "Verified Creators can be anyone who has a bit of modding experience, and filled out the application. It isn't really the status symbol that people make it out to be. In my observation, Bethesda seems to be casting a wide net right now.\n\nAs for the paid mods, they do go through Bethesda's QA and approval processes. But if what you're saying about the Locke mod is true, then there are multiple examples now of that not meaning much. There are strange, seemingly random issues with the game's mod support right now, so it could just be an issue on your end... but I've heard [other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRWysvHwMm4) describe similar issues with that mod that you've had, so who knows.\n\nIMO, especially with things like this, you want to look up reviews and testimonials before buying. There is no legal way to try them for free beforehand, and no way to refund them if they don't live up to expectations. Really need to do as much research as possible before deciding if any of these are worth the investment.\n\nAlso need to remember that as of right now, mod authors are under ZERO obligation to provide ongoing support with game updates. So there is no guarantee that something you buy now will always work with the game. That alone makes them not worth the price to me.",
            "Derec's got some dialogue with no voice acting too. Very disappointing.",
            "Paid for the \u2018Deluxe Dynamic Boostpack\u2019 and now my Boostpack doesn\u2019t work. The issue also seems to be occurring with the free \u2018Simple Boostpack\u2019 version aswell. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the mod or the game. Sucks tho",
            "One of several issues with paid mods.\n\nThere's no inherent incentive to make good mods as long as they can be presented on a formal storefront for money. It's five feet away from an asset flip game.\n\nSimilarly is the limitations imposed. The promise of being compensated for their effort is cool, if it actually translated to the content. Except the free mods on Nexus have consistently been better than their paid counterparts on Creation Club, with no small factor being that they have to rely on the creation kit and not the likes of script extenders or otherwise, meaning many functions and features simply don't exist and the paid mods are beholden strictly to the the core game and toolkit.",
            "Pay walling mods is rat behavior.\n\nYou give money to rats, you get what you pay for.",
            "Stellar Armory is locking up the creation page itself (constantly reloading) and it\u2019s still available on there. That one should be pulled off asap until it\u2019s fixed. I can\u2019t imagine what the backlash is gonna be when it\u2019s a paid mod that does that. \n\nImperial Armaments has to be deleted and redownloaded each time you load up a save to play, otherwise the skins don\u2019t appear properly",
            "What surprised me the most in buying paid mods was that they were not being translated; I'm French and as there is not much explenation on paid \"creations\" I tought they were officials Bethesda mods like fallout 4 and skyrim creation club things, turn out I paid for untranslated things that totally ruin immersion for me (I do understand English tho so it's just an immersion issue since I built a small LO that didn't change any text before, but some other peoples that don't understand English at all might be really disappointed by this)"

Look at Injustice 2 as an example. You can use a trainer to give yourself credits and buy everything. I did it because screw microtransactions. i bought the game.\n\nTheir goal is making money. It's greed. They're selling microtransactions in a single player game. They're not going to give you free credits when their goal is making money money by selling credits."
