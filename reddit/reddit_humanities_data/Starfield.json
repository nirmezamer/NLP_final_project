        "content": "Hey gang,\n\nAfter a lot of feedback from the community, we have decided to ban comprehensive review posts from the subreddit. Before you get the pitchforks out, hear us out as to the why.\n\n**First, let's define a comprehensive review post.** It's a post in which the author lays out everything they like and dislike about the game in a manner similar to a media outlet giving a review.\n\n**Okay, so what's so bad about that?** Well, there are a few things. For starters, these posts have been flooding the subreddit and not really doing anything to advance discussion of the game. They're not very actionable for the devs to make changes. And they just get people fighting over the same shit every day.\n\n**But you're censoring our dissent!** No, we're not. We're focusing it. You have a gripe with a particular system in the game? Make a post about that system. Break down what you like and dislike about shipbuilding or NPC interactions or inventory management or power acquisition. THAT post will drive actionable feedback that the devs can use.\n\nIf you still want to pretend you're Paul Tassi and write a 500 word magnum opus on the 10 things you wish you'd known before playing Bethesda's latest game, we recommend starting a blog OR you can just leave it in the comments.\n\nKind regards,\n\nThe /r/Starfield Mod Team",

            "No one else is brave enough to say it but if I get banned for calling this out then ban away. This choice is for sure because you all \"don't like\" the posts. It's not actually taking away from the enjoyment of this sub. \n\nI get annoyed seeing \"LOOK AT MAH CUSTOM SHIP!!!!\" and guess what? I just scroll past the post.",

        "content": "Any time I land on a planet, a Starborn ship lands and drops a small army of Starborns in search of me. I usually ignore them, but this last time I touched down on a planet, they landed on a civilian outpost near my landing area. I knew this was bad since they gave a habit of killing any living thing they see, so I rushed to the outpost as fast as I can, and sadly, my presence triggered their spawns, and thus began the barrage of bullets and lasers as the Starborn slaughtered the civilians. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, they were also firing at peaceful pterodactyl-like aliens, this level of bloodlust and cruelty makes me think that almost all of these Starborn agree with the Hunter\u2019s mentality.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t even mind their vendetta against me for hoarding the Artifacts and beating them on the race to Unity countless times, but this murderhobo mentality is just plain crazy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s intentional or not, but it\u2019s just weird how the Starborn are fixated on killing everything they see.\n",

Who cares if pirates take over? Why not manipulate everyone you know using information you shouldn't have yet? You won't be in this universe forever anyway. If you were powerful, immortal, and had a way to restart, most people would start to think this way.",

            "In general, just assume that the game will not have unique dialogue or reactions to *anything* and you won't be disappointed.\n\nThose unique universes were probably just easter eggs that blew up in popularity.",
            "It's ironic that NG+ basically proves the Hunter's point that none of it really matters and the only thing that does is getting to the Unity as fast as possible.",
            "It does really take the shine off of the novel ng+ worlds when there is no narrative payoff beyond the first entry to the lodge.",
            "NG+ is how the universe starts, and Starborn dialogues. They hype the NG+ system, but it's barebones interesting Alt universe beginnings but that's pretty much it.",
            "Yeah it really bothered me also since it was my favorite alternate universe, they could have at least added a funny line like Mary why didnt you tell me we had twins! Or I must still be drunk from poker night since im seeing double however things like this are common in Bethesda games, they lack polish and its like they say f#ck it for aspects of almost every part of the game.",
            "I had the exact same reaction lmao, except I managed to get the universe with a You? version of me and I chose to keep him as a companion. I went home and they were just talking to me and not even mentioning their actual son. Had me laughing my ass off like wow Bethesda, ya did it again! LOL.",
            "I got a NG+ where Andreja had killed everyone in Constellation. My parents showed up, stood knee deep in dead zealots, and told me how much (dead) Noel liked their cookies.\n\nI get the feeling they didn't have a lot of communication between the quest designers, planning out all the combinations before starting.",
            "I think a big issue is they intended NG+ to literally just be NG+. As in, they intended you to only do it after you have gotten to a stopping point and maybe came back later, but rather than starting a completely new character... you could instead go through the Unity. Then they would offer little perks when you do it, such as unique dialogue (occasionally), Starborn items/ship, and on rare occasion... a unique universe.\n\nBut because it's a part of the story, and because there is extra content locked behind NG+, people don't actually treat it like it's NG+. They did more than you normally would expect for a NG+ yet it feels like it backfired on them because people treat it like it's a part of a single playthrough.",
            "You act like it's the first time. The game is full of moments like this because they rushed it and it is unfinished."

Once the settings are tweaked to the player's preferences, it's a solid shooter experience wrapped up in all those fun RPG systems.\n\nI say this as a lifelong player of FPS games on PC and console. I don't claim to be a pro or guru of all things FPS, but I've played enough games to know what doesn't work for me or what just needs some more tuning.\n\nFor my taste, Starfield's first-person combat is always enjoyable, especially when there's low gravity to play with it.\n\nThat's all, just a positive note I wanted to share.
