        "content": "Hello all,\n\nIt's that time of the month again. This is your opportunity to create the new porn-free you! One month is ending and another chance to continue or start your commitment is upon us.\n\nThe theme of this month is \"Jumpstart June\". Getting a head start on the life you want for yourself through being consistent with establishing good habits.\n\nThe purpose of this thread is to provide rebooters with a place to share their commitment to abstain from particular sexual behaviors throughout the entire month.\n\nNew to [NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/nofap) and rebooting? Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Learn about the website, porn addiction, excessive masturbation, sexual compulsivity, and abstaining from PMO. Read through [NoFap's main website](http://www.nofap.com/) to get informed.\n* Read about the basics of rebooting [here](http://www.nofap.com/rebooting). Rebooting is the abstinence from certain sexual behaviors to recover from pornography addiction. Read about how porn addiction develops here. Some people go beyond rebooting and into the territory of retention, or sexual transmutation for periods of time, although that is not the main purpose of this subreddit (which is RECOVERY).\n* Consider reading through the free [Getting Started PDF](http://www.nofap.com/getting-started) from NoFap's website.\n* Download NoFap's in-browser panic button extension that blocks NSFW subreddits too. [Download here](https://www.nofap.com/updates/porn-reddit-nofap-app-for-that/)\n* Decide if rebooting is something that you really want. If you don't buy into the process 100%, you'll probably not make it through the month. If you have decided that you would like to participate, proceed to the next point.\n* Sign up for this month by replying to this submission. It is that simple. State your intention and stick to it!\n* Consider setting up a [day counter badge](https://tracker.nofap.com/) to track your progress.\n* Ask questions and get support by posting on [NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/nofap). Set a goal to remain accountable by making a post daily. Help others. Come here every day and participate.\n* If you need additional support, you can get an [accountability partner](http://nofap.com/forum/index.php?forums/accountability-partners.7/) and [document your progress in a daily rebooting journal](http://nofap.com/forum/index.php#nofap-journals.8).\n\n**Would you like to participate? If so, please reply to this thread with the following information.**\n\n* Are you not going to allow yourself to masturbate? View porn? Orgasm whatsoever? Not allowing any outlet for sexual release is called \"hard mode\".\n* How long do you want this challenge to last? By default it is one month, but 90 days is recommended for rebooting.\n* What are your goals?\n* Why are you doing this?\n\n**Arriving late? (past the first of the month?)**\n\nIt's okay! Still state your intentions and don't postpone rebooting based on the day of the month. People can join in at any time to participate.\n\n**Update us!**\n\nIf you want to post a quick update, such as \"day 1!\", please post it in this thread. Otherwise, feel free to post check-ins with information about your recovery onto the subreddit forum. Again, if you want to monitor your progress long-term, we recommend starting a journal thread on NoFap's main site to keep things organized into one place for you to refer back to.\n\n**Badges**\n\n[Sign up here](http://tracker.nofap.com/). for a rebooting day counter.",

Being porn-free is the normal state a person should be in, and then I want to give my future wife all the love and attention she deserves, and certainly pmo is preventing me from that.",
            "That's it, I've had it! I'm quitting social media (atleast for the next 5 months). Everytime I convince myself that social media isn't bad it's just some of the accounts and all i need to do is block, delete or mute those accounts. The algorithm knows me too well and eventually i'm brought back into the loop. Not this time, I've had it! I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired! Imma be here everyday so let's keep each other accountable (watch my counter, i'm dead serious). (at the very least i may share a motivational quote each day)",
            "Joining the challenge! Here are my answers:\n\n1. No porn or masturbation whatsoever.\n\n2. 100 days minimum, goal would be lifelong. \n\n3. To clear myself of brain fog, to have more confidence, and to be more outgoing. \n\n4. I am doing this to show myself that I have the fortitude and ability to change a habit I've had for 10 years and to live life to its fullest potential.",

Eliminate the brain fog and perform better in my relationship both in bed and outside. \n\nHow am I doing this? Don't have a clear answer for that yet, but I've kept myself busy with videogames, movies and going outside."

            "The benefits of NoFap are not purely from your streak. This is a common belief here, and it's untrue. You've spent most of a year without porn or masturbation, and you've no doubt gained a lot from this experience-- self control, self respect, a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nInstead of beating off every day, you've masturbated once in 257 days. That puts you leagues ahead of most guys. Don't beat yourself up, you're right where you need to be.",
            "Brother you did very good and as long as you are not watching porn it's all good, masturbation is not the enemy it's been there for as long as human civilization or maybe lil less. But the main antagonist is pornography, all the best for the future stay away from porn.",
            "I'm not an expert myself in the subject but cmon how are you going to lose all the benefits that easily? It's like going to the gym for many years straight in a row without skipping a single day and one day you don't go and suddenly lose all your bodybuilding? Again, I'm not an expert, but I don't think it would make much sense to lose all progress just like that.",
            "You relapsed with masturbation only, didn\u2019t cave into porn.  You\u2019re doing great and will continue to do well moving forward.  You still the benefits of your discipline, confidence, and health, so don\u2019t worry about losing those.",
            "The game changer for me was when someone said it isn\u2019t so much fapping that is the problem, (it\u2019s still a problem) but the despair that comes after fapping. So instead of focusing on the fact you fapped, focus on your despair and regret. Forgive yourself, be proud of your incredible streak but don\u2019t despair. Despair will drive the addiction, it\u2019s fapping every day that\u2019s the real problem. \n\nI went 700 days in my 20\u2019s and I failed around the 2 years mark. I felt like absolute shit and I returned to nearly daily PMO for the next decade. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self how proud I was of him for going that long and to not beat himself up too much. One day is nothing. But if you let those negative, hopeless feelings overwhelm you, that one day becomes 10 years and THAT is the real tragedy.",
            "Bro u want my advice? if u did this just do the math -1 and now u are on day 256 and bro just stop counting the days and focus on improving yourself mentally and physically and  all, nice streak man it\u2019s not about the streak as much as it is about the self control and the experience u gain, keep going and never stop bro \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Hey you did a great job. Do not bother! My highest streak without porn was 10 days. But I make progress. And to be honest if you do not use porn for masturbation, I personally would not see a problem. Great work brother! Keep going",
            "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a relapse , if you\u2019re counting then yes but if you\u2019re changing your life then no not at relapse you\u2019re just reset back to normal and had a wank but you likely have the tools and new mindset now to not let it consume you so I hope you stop counting and enjoy your new life",
            "That's the issue. Don't count the days because it feels like you are going to miss someday so ypu gotta set up a record.\n\nJust keep asking yourself every time you have the urge \"will you feel better afterwards?\" Depending on the answer, do it or not.\n\nGood luck :)",

Most of the time I dont even need to have an orgasm nor does it feel as compulsive conpared to consuming porn.\n\nAfterwards I dont feel like shit either.\n\nDont matter what everyone else says, see and try for yourself.",
            "All of the idiots in the comments don't understand. NoFap doesn't mention not touching your pp. This is how I reached 90 days: I masturbated without any imagery. Then I did semen retention. You can't just all of a sudden decide to rip off this deeply engrained habit all at once that you have been consolidating for YEARS. Nofap says porn is horrible and sex is great and masturbation is okay. Once you stop porn then you can work your way stopping fapping for super Human benefits.",
