        "content": "Hello all,\n\nIt's that time of the month again. This is your opportunity to create the new porn-free you! One month is ending and another chance to continue or start your commitment is upon us.\n\nThe theme of this month is \"Jumpstart June\". Getting a head start on the life you want for yourself through being consistent with establishing good habits.\n\nThe purpose of this thread is to provide rebooters with a place to share their commitment to abstain from particular sexual behaviors throughout the entire month.\n\nNew to [NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/nofap) and rebooting? Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Learn about the website, porn addiction, excessive masturbation, sexual compulsivity, and abstaining from PMO. Read through [NoFap's main website](http://www.nofap.com/) to get informed.\n* Read about the basics of rebooting [here](http://www.nofap.com/rebooting). Rebooting is the abstinence from certain sexual behaviors to recover from pornography addiction. Read about how porn addiction develops here. Some people go beyond rebooting and into the territory of retention, or sexual transmutation for periods of time, although that is not the main purpose of this subreddit (which is RECOVERY).\n* Consider reading through the free [Getting Started PDF](http://www.nofap.com/getting-started) from NoFap's website.\n* Download NoFap's in-browser panic button extension that blocks NSFW subreddits too. [Download here](https://www.nofap.com/updates/porn-reddit-nofap-app-for-that/)\n* Decide if rebooting is something that you really want. If you don't buy into the process 100%, you'll probably not make it through the month. If you have decided that you would like to participate, proceed to the next point.\n* Sign up for this month by replying to this submission. It is that simple. State your intention and stick to it!\n* Consider setting up a [day counter badge](https://tracker.nofap.com/) to track your progress.\n* Ask questions and get support by posting on [NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/nofap). Set a goal to remain accountable by making a post daily. Help others. Come here every day and participate.\n* If you need additional support, you can get an [accountability partner](http://nofap.com/forum/index.php?forums/accountability-partners.7/) and [document your progress in a daily rebooting journal](http://nofap.com/forum/index.php#nofap-journals.8).\n\n**Would you like to participate? If so, please reply to this thread with the following information.**\n\n* Are you not going to allow yourself to masturbate? View porn? Orgasm whatsoever? Not allowing any outlet for sexual release is called \"hard mode\".\n* How long do you want this challenge to last? By default it is one month, but 90 days is recommended for rebooting.\n* What are your goals?\n* Why are you doing this?\n\n**Arriving late? (past the first of the month?)**\n\nIt's okay! Still state your intentions and don't postpone rebooting based on the day of the month. People can join in at any time to participate.\n\n**Update us!**\n\nIf you want to post a quick update, such as \"day 1!\", please post it in this thread. Otherwise, feel free to post check-ins with information about your recovery onto the subreddit forum. Again, if you want to monitor your progress long-term, we recommend starting a journal thread on NoFap's main site to keep things organized into one place for you to refer back to.\n\n**Badges**\n\n[Sign up here](http://tracker.nofap.com/). for a rebooting day counter.",

The algorithm knows me too well and eventually i'm brought back into the loop. Not this time, I've had it! I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired!

Jerking off (and porn, according to some sources) leads to lower self esteem, which could be one of the reasons you\u2019re struggling with those aspects of your life. So don\u2019t despair, work to change for the better and replace the jerking off with habits that will help you get to the future you want. What better time to change than right now?

            "So it's emotional regulation for you. And if you feel like shit otherwise, I can see why'd you coom.\n\n\nYou lay out valid reasons for depression. Depression itself is healthy reaction to stress, life circumstances, and mental pain (caused by said things). Nothing wrong with you, but your life needs to go more to towards your liking. Having love, friends, a job.\n\n\n\nJust remove porn to get the benefit for sex life. One of the biggest hurdles is that you train to be an observer instead of participant. In this aspect stopping porn has been enough for me.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you do not know what to do, please be more specific. On what issue you would want to have an idea to do? What is your current capacity to do things? Can you manage talking to a stranger in public? How about show thumbs up? How about look at their eyes and smile?\n\n\nDepression requires humility to accept the very small largest possible step.",
