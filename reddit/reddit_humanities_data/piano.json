The shop would arrange for the delivery and set-up, but when I move, I'd have to deal with it myself.\n\nI was looking at a Yamaha P-225 for ease of transport. But when I went to the shop today and tried the CLP-745, it felt so much better under my fingers, and having the screen to navigate settings helps so much.\n\nThen, the shopkeeper showed me the CSP-275, which blew me away. I want to compose music, and the ability to immediately transcribe was pretty attractive.\n\nAnyone have experience living in small quarters with a digital piano? Or moving them up/down lots of flights of stairs?",

Sometimes my brain goes blank during a passage I just practiced 10x about 15 min earlier and I play eg 12345 even though I had already filled into 12312. Sometimes I look at the music and I suddenly can't tell whether the note is an E or G. I'm an intermediate player."

We press a key, which has a rod with a barrel at the end (capstan\\*). This capstan comes into contact with the\\* whippen\\*. The whippen has\\* a jack\\*, which is a movable stick on a spring that moves here and activates the hammer. The hammer has a part called the\\* balance\\*, and the whippen has a part called the\\* backcheck\\*. The ability to increase the number of strikes the hammer makes on the string here depends on how the balance and backcheck are adjusted relative to each other. In the video, you see\\* Mr. Vladimir Sukhopyatkin demonstrating how he achieves an increase in these strikes on the string by bending the backcheck wire. When it is not working correctly, the jack comes out from under the hammer after striking the string, and the hammer falls very deep onto the backcheck here. And when we try to do a double repetition here, we cannot achieve it because the jack has slipped. On the notes A and B, Vladimir Sukhopyatkin adjusted it in such a way that the backcheck immediately \"catches\" the balance, allowing the jack to repeatedly activate the hammer. What do you need to do? It's a simple operation: you are trying to push the backcheck wire away from you. This creates the possibility of a double repetition.*\n\n[https://youtu.be/X2YhtnKEpDY?si=DGThNizyqE6CZOHv](https://youtu.be/X2YhtnKEpDY?si=DGThNizyqE6CZOHv)\n\nregards, Max[](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-llYEcJG1XRrFtGnTxeISNI2pRsc_xX)",

That might help a little as well. \n\nNone likes a depressed piano.",
