Sometimes my brain goes blank during a passage I just practiced 10x about 15 min earlier and I play eg 12345 even though I had already filled into 12312.

In the year in between, I practiced every day, 5 easy pieces daily at least (e.g. Haydn Minuets, Mikrokosmos 1-4, Album fr die Jugend), sight reading was my top priority. However, I did not feel like I made any meaningful progress. Was my method ineffective or does it just take a long time for everyone?",

If I set it to a quarter note, things stop to line up very quickly. Wondering if I'm missing some clever trick here that will let me do even 75% speed with the metronome, or if I'll have to get this part up to speed without my fancy tools."

There the descending arpeggios with the right hand are triplets with 3 over 2 polyrhithm and feels hard to phrase because the alternating high-low note pattern calls for dividing them in group of 2 instead of 3. I listened a lot to the Rubinstein version and noticed that what it does is that he plays those section quite fast, and he slightly alter the left hand tempo so that basically the triplets sound more like regular semiquivers. I tried to imitate that. It took a lot of practice. Not easy to explain in words but I hope it makes some sense. The last descending arpeggios in triplets in measure 45 is similar in that regard, you want to move the accents in less natural positions and not at the start of each triplet as your hands would like to do. This last one though is generally played slower and slowing down toward the end. Hope it helps.",
