        "content": "Recently, the moderation team has noticed an uptick in violations of our subreddit rules. Due to this, we decided to create and pin a thread with an overview of the rules. Please read them before posting or commenting. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us via modmail.\n\n**Rule #1: Don't be a jerk.**\n\nThis shouldn't be a difficult thing to understand, but some people have problems separating their feelings for a user, and what that user has posted.\n\n* Bigotry of any form, whether it be racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, sectarianism, etc...will not be tolerated on r/FanTheories.\n* It's okay to dislike a theory, but you must offer constructive criticism, instead of being outright insulting. Criticism for the sole purpose of insulting the OP is not allowed on the subreddit.\n* It is NOT okay to call someone names because they don't agree with you. This includes calling them variations of \"dumb\", or suggesting they are mentally unwell.\n* Brigading is absolutely not allowed. If you have a personal problem with a user, and have followed them onto this subreddit to harass them, then you will be permanently banned. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and brigading on r/FanTheories.\n\nPlease note that moderators cannot do anything about people who are harassing you via PM. You must contact site admins, and use the report function, if that happens.\n\nIt should go without saying, but please also make sure to read the whole theory before commenting. This helps to avoid any possible altercations, arguments, or misunderstandings in the comments.\n\n**Rule #2: Please provide evidence.**\n\nEvidence makes for a good theory, and evidence will be judged at the discretion of the mods. (Most posts usually meet this rule already.) We typically accept posts if they have at least 1-3 paragraphs' worth of evidence. Anything that is just one to a few sentences will be removed.\n\n**Rule #3: Theories must be about creative works.**\n\nTV shows, movies, video games, anime, comic books, novels and even songs are things we like to see, but events pertaining to real life are not. This also includes politics, religion, and talking about real-life events related to a creative work - such as development - rather than the creative work itself.\n\nWe also currently do not allow any theories about real-life people that are unrelated to a fictional work, such as speculation about celebrities, historical figures, and other people of public interest. However, if your theory is related to a real-life person within the in-universe canon, scope, or world of a fictional work - for example, \"\\[Marvel\\] Stan Lee also exists in the MCU universe\" -  we do allow that.\n\n**Rule #4: Tag all spoilers.**\n\nPlease do not include spoilers in the title of your posts, be as vague as possible. And for posts that are not marked with the spoiler flair, please use spoiler tags in the comment section:\n\n\\[Spoiler Text Here!\\](#spoiler)\n\n[For more information, please read our in-depth policy on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/wiki/rules/spoilers)\n\n**Rule #5: Add the media name to your title before posting.**\n\nWhether it's the name of the movie, show or video game, please tell us what you're talking about by putting the name in the title. Flairing your post is not enough.\n\nTitle formatting examples:\n\n* \"\\[The Matrix\\] Neo wasn't really the 'The One'\" (Flair: FanTheory)\n* \"\\[Star Wars\\] Anakin wasn't really 'The Chosen One'\" (Flair: Star Wars)\n* \"\\[The Batman\\] Speculation about what Batman will do next\" (Flair: Marvel/DC + Spoiler tag)\n\n[For more information, please read our in-depth policy on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/wiki/rules/titles)\n\n**Rule #6: No low-effort posts.**\n\nLow-effort posts include submissions that are just a title, posts that are joke/meme related or those with no evidence in them. For joke theories, please see r/ShittyFanTheories.\n\nWe also do not take too kindly to reposts or stolen content, either. If you have copied and pasted a theory or article from elsewhere, or r/FanTheories itself, you must make it abundantly clear that the idea belongs to someone else, and give them full credit.\n\n**Rule #7: High Volume Topic Standards**\n\nTopics we receive a large number of submissions about will be subject to higher-quality standards than other posts. We ask for at least 1-2 paragraphs of writing about your theory, and at least one specific citation - or piece of evidence - from the work the theory is based on.\n\nSubjects that commonly fall under this rule include blockbuster series, like Marvel and *Star Wars*, and theory ideas that caught on, like \"purgatory\" theories.\n\n[Read our in-depth policy on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/wiki/rules/highvolumetopicstandards)\n\n**Rule #8: All posts with an external link must have a write-up.**\n\nIf the theory or speculation was originally in video format, such as YouTube, or found on another website, you must provide a write-up to explain the theory, including evidence. People shouldn't have to leave the sub to know what your theory is.\n\n**Rule #9: Unapproved advertising on the subreddit is not allowed.**\n\nWhether you want to promote your podcast, YouTube channel, blog, or another subreddit, we do ask that you contact the mod team via mod mail before you post. We are more likely to turn you down if it is not fan theory or speculation-related.\n\n**Rule #10: Posts must be flaired.**\n\nWe ask that you flair your post based on these criteria:\n\n* FanTheory - A theory regarding past or present works.\n* FanSpeculation - A theory speculating the contents of future works.\n* Marvel/DC - All works related to Marvel/DC content, MCU, video games, and comics.\n* Star Wars - All works related the *Star Wars* franchise.\n* Confirmed - Existing theories which have turned out to be right, but must be backed up with supporting external evidence.\n* Meta - Posts regarding the subreddit r/FanTheories itself.\n\nIf you do not add a flair to your post, one will be added for you by a moderator.",

        "content": "Creed is probably my favorite character of the show. I'm on a new re-watch of the show when I started noticing something fishy. It was about how the Scranton branch was doing so good despite all the other branches suffering losses, at a point when the economy was in shambles. This leads David Wallace to be stupefied and tries to learn from Michael what it is that he's doing so he can apply it to the other branches. The only problem is that there is nothing to learn from Michael.. Because it's not due to him. The reason why the branch is running so well is due to Creed, and the way he is doing it is by running a secret drug empire in the style of Walter White..\n\n\nNow hear me out. I know it sounds crazy. But believe me, the crazier it sounds, the more it is like something right up Creed's alley.. So I'm not sure if you're familiar with the theory about accounting, about them being involved in some really shady stuff, fraud and so on. I believe that accounting totally ties in to this story, as well as probably someone from corporate and the warehouse. \n\nThe evidence is riddled throughout the whole show.. Creed has more fun as a follower but he makes a lot more money as a leader. The benefit of having a cult run your drug business is that you don't even have to pay your followers, they do it out of worship. \n\nMaybe you know the sketch that was done for the Emmys where Aaron Paul goes to The Office to hook up with Creed. I don't think that was just a funny cross-over bit, but rather think that was intentional. \n\n\nCreed is no stranger to criminal activity. He is super nervous when cops show up at work when Michael plants the stuff on Toby. When Dwight says someone is hiding drugs in the office, he gets up, ready to surrender, thinking that his scam is up. He shows up at work completely covered in blood, conveniently on Halloween, after taking out some competition. When Michael says to him \"Sir, there's been a murder!\" he again freaks out (2nd body). He has extensive knowledge of drugs, including all types of painkillers, strains of weed, heroin from the Taliban etc. He is living under someone else's identity, most likely someone he murdered, named Creed Bratton. He also does the best Joker impression ever, since he embodies the role. \n\nOkay, okay. But what has this got to do with a drug empire, you say? Well, I've been watching the show with this theory in mind when I hit upon the best clue yet! I'm watching the episode called The Lover when they are in the conference room talking about having to communicate better with communities, when Andy says that it's about the working conditions in their PERUVIAN paper mill, where Michael says that they had nothing to do with the cancer cluster, to which the camera pans to Creed who shakes his head like \"well, actually..\". As for the drug itself, I'm willing to bet on cocaine as it would be easier to blend it in with some papers. And the name of their product? Betty White. \n\n\nSo now we know where he gets the drugs from. How he distributes them is quite easy. Creed is using the same system Gus Fring uses in Breaking Bad, only instead of chicken buckets he uses boxes full of paper. For this to work, he of course has the depot on his payroll, as well as the truck drivers \n\nNot only is Creed doing his deliveries through the company, but he is also laundering his cash through it too. This is where the accounting team comes into play. They do magic with those numbers and make everything work, and that's why there are three accountants doing a one man's job. In order not to attract any unwanted attention from corporate, they make sure to always keep the branch profitable. And that's why, even when times are the worst and all branches are suffering, Scranton has no problems whatsoever. Also, when Jim is talking to Creed about the birthday cake, Jim says he'll talk to Angela and Creed tells him \"Tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.\" Yeah.. \n\nCreed for sure has someone from corporate in his scheme as well, the person who helped him set get the stuff through their Peruvian plant as well as to make sure that no one from corporate looks too closely at their branch, someone who's to him as Madrigal was for Fring. We saw before that corporate doesn't shy away from illegal activities if it means helping their business, like Meredith's discount, and there are points during the financial crisis where the Scranton branch is the only one basically keeping the entire company still running. So it warrants that they would be capable of doing a lot of shady things to keep it running. Including helping creed run his secret drug empire.\n\nIn conclusion, Creed is running a drug business through the Scranton branch, getting drugs through their paper plant, distributing it through their paper routes and laundering the money through their accounting team. In order to not bring any attention to the branch, he always keeps it profitable and that's why Scranton is doing so well despite people barely ever working. \n\nFinally, best Creed quote to end the story, \"What if you've been bad? What if you've been really, really bad? More evil than strictly wrong.\" ",

            "I like this idea, and it genuinely wouldn't surprise me if Creed's been running a drug business through under Mifflin on the side, but honestly the simpler answer to why it's profitable is better (and more boring). Right around they turned it around was when stamford got absorbed into them. They got a much larger client base, all but one member of the staff quit or was fired, and they only have to pay rent for the one location now. Basically doubling their profits (possibly more since stamford was doing much better). It's also why they had to fight some guys in (I think Albany) over old stamford clients, and why they were willing to have two managers - they had twice the clientele/region to manage.",

            "Another point for your theory. If Creed and Michael started at Dunder Mifflin roughly around the same time, or Creed before him. Michael talked about how in the 80s, the branch was moving a lot of paper, due to cocaine. Which probably were supplied by Creed. Or this is where he got his foot in the door with Dunder Mifflin.\n\nAnd Creed being charge of quality control, it kinda makes sense that he is able to influence the shipping of papers and drugs.",

Were they humans, or were they Homo floresiensis ?\n\nSince they still lived as recently as a few thousands years ago,  or else Sanskrit speakers would not have seen them, they can not be Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisovensis, Homo erectus erectus, Homo (erectus) soloensis or an archaic subspecies of Homo sapiens, because such hominids would have been in very small numbers by the end of the last glacial maximum, and would have been assimilated by the many people and various migration waves (Negritos, Veddas, Dravidians, Austroasiatics etc.) way earlier than late Bronze Age. However, Homo floresiensis did not interbred much with humans, as is testified by the lack of floresiensis genes of Rampasasa Pygmies living in the Liang Bua Cave area.\n\nHomo floresiensis had 46 chromosomes and could have had fertile children with Homo sapiens, but it looked so hairy, short and primitive it likely barely happened at all.\n\nSo what Vanaras were ? Were they Negritolike pygmy tribes of human hunter gatherers, or were they small, primitive hominids ? And how tall Vanaras were really ?",

Some folks also include *Homo habilis* in the 'human' category too, but *H. habils* has some issues with classification and *H. erectus* is where the 'human' category is unambiguously applied.",
            "Ok, indeed it is possible it is all as made up as Lord of the Rings is. Still one of the best piece of human literature, just as Lord of the Rings itself, but Vanaras as a either a physical creature, either an ethnicity of humans, are not impossible and are believed even by some who are not Hinduists.",
            "1. Homo floresiensis was one of the earliest Homo species, or at least the ancestor species diverged from our line at the start of our genus. Our last common ancestor is not even Homo habilis, Homo habilis was a sister species to the ancestors of floresiensis. Our last common ancestor is Australopithecus afarensis. Homo floresiensis is less humanlike than Homo erectus.\n2. So to you a Homo erectus georgicus, 600 cc brain, covered in body hair, unable to talk and control fire is a...human ?! I know for a fact my IQ is in the 75 - 80 range, but I if I was living between specimens of Homo erectus georgicus, I would be their own Einstein !",
            "From what I've read, the prevailing theory was that vanaras and jambavan are deities and beliefs from pre-vedic tribal people in the subcontinent that were absorbed into the canon of Hindu beliefs.\n\n\nA kind of \"see we worship your ancestral Gods too!\". Like aligning Christmas with pagan rituals.",

            "We don't know who the ancestors of *H. floresiensis* are, but at present the most widely accepted idea is that they derived from *H. erectus*.  It is possible the they came from an earlier branch, but if they did the proposal is *H. hablis* or a close relative, not any Australopithecine.\n\n*Homo erectus* is the species that *invented* how to control fire, cooking, and a lot more, and the loss of body hair dats back to over 3 million years ago with Australopithecines.  *H. erectus* was as hairless as you and I.\n\nFurthermore, *H. erectus* exhibits a wide range of complex tasks and foresighted group activities essentially necessitating complex communication and language.  Daniel Everette goes into this in a lot of detail, I suggest you pick up some of his work.\n\nSo, yes, *H. erectus*, of whatever subspecies, is absolutely 'human'.\n\nAs an aside, you would be an 'Einstein' because you have the advantage of being able to take advantage of a vast repository of recorded knowledge stored outside of our brains, which is a pretty recent thing even within our own species in most places around the world.  You are not necessarily nay more intelligent that any of our ancestors (*H. sapiens* or not) or relatives, you just have an advantage due to the resources of the society and culture you found yourself in."
