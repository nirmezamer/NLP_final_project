            "Furthermore, what does this increase in housing costs mean for younger first time homebuyers? What does it mean for their ability to build wealth, save for retirement, have expendable money, build generational wealth, etc?

            "Classical economics dictates that as the cost of money (ie: interest rates) increases, the price of goods should be under pressure, but this is not what we have seen in the housing markets. In the 4 years from 2Q 2016 to 2Q 2020, 30 year fixed rates went from 3.54% down to 2.98%. At the same time, median US home prices went from $306,000 to $317,100, a CAGR of about  +0.9%.(Using FRED data).Pretty much in line with classical economic expectations.\n\nHowever, from 2Q 2020 to 2Q 2024, 30 yr fixed rates went from 2.98% to now around 7.60%. In this same time, median US home prices have risen from $317,100 to $420,800, a CAGR of over 9%. \n\nI understand the covid effect for some of this, but the rate of price appreciation has continued on past the end of lockdowns. Additionally, if this was due to a demographic shift out of cities to suburbs, why are median rent prices in cities continuing to increase at strong rates, with NYC median rents +4.3% in 2023, and rising a further +5.4% in 2024.\n\nDo interest rates even matter right now? Have demographics broken the interest rate mechanism? At what point does affordability, taking into account the impact of higher rates, start to weigh on prices?",

If they try to do what Canada was doing, they will be more crowded than before with more expensive housing that drives up cost of living. Their decline in population is good and showing good result.

            "Theyre finally starting to see a little inflation after decades. Year over year records arent exactly accurate because they didnt really open to tourism until the fall of 2022 and 2023 was just the start of the return. 2023 was 79% of pre pandemic levels. So, maybe 2024 reaches new highs finally.\n\nJapanese central banks will need to pivot if inflation rises but they also dont want to raise rates too soon. They wont want to potentially snuff out what may be the beginning of the end of the lost decades. The yen is getting crushed by the US Fed unwilling to cut rates and the world is waiting. Perfect time to visit Japan if you are going with USD.",
            "Not just for weaker yen, but Japan had also heavily invested in hotel, infrastructure and services (new airlines, etc) for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but COVID happened.   On the supply side, its a lot more than pre covid.",
            "Nope. Up until 10 years ago, the number of foreign visitors to Japan was way less than 10 million. This number didn't not match some of the top destinations like France, USA, China, Italy or Spain and it didn't even make it to the second tier group.\n\nThe country is after all quite a distance away from the US and EU and most of people there can't speak in English (at least, not at the same level as Thailand or Malaysia)  so that's why more than half of tourists have been Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese, but yeah the weaker yen and some efforts from the government help to tripe the number."

            "> IRS Confirms Marijuana Rescheduling Will Allow Legal Marijuana Businesses to Take Tax Deductions\n\nAs it should with any legal business. Business expenses are an economic stimulus in many ways as well. \n\nWhile they can be gamed it works like higher taxes on wealth or corporate, to lower the tax burden you spend into the economy to re-invest in the business and it is a tax avoidance fueled stimulus. You can always count on that self-interest to work. Both spend in the economy and re-investing in the business are good and lead to more investable companies that are reinvesting in themselves and the surrounding economies. It can be gamed but the games even end up with more money in the markets/economy in many ways, and they can be called out later.",

            "Diversity is good. Hiring less competent employees because they are diverse will bite you in the ass. Smaller companies generally just hire the best. Anyway, if there is one area in corporate culture needs a reckoning is HR. I have never seen such a cocky and smug group of people.",
            "Obviously diversity doesnt matter much. If you work at a top company you quickly realize the companies pushing diversity the most are also the least innovative. This is because diversity is only seriously pursued by self interested talentless folks and bankrupt corporations that are trying to win social points when they cant deliver.  \n\nGrifters dont innovate. A healthy company builds. They dont loudly shout how they are diverse and money doesnt pour in as Redditors clap along.",
            "Diversity was not supposed to make us rich. Political diversity isnt even real diversity. It is and has always been a political ploy. \n\nI would welcome true diversity. But I think that if you focus on inclusivity and transparency you get diversity as a byproduct.",

            "Diversity is good for big business, but you have to be a clueless clown to think that diversity is good for the common individual. Its basic supply and demand. When the supply of common workers increase, the pay (demand) will decrease. But dumb people just eat up whatever media/politicians tell them, and these people all have incentive to lie to the common idiots/people since they benefit in multiple ways from big businesses.",
            "So diversity is useful when it brings lateral and valuable insights to solve an intractable problem. Also, Diversity is different from social justice. Both are desirable but different. So let's say a 10 person all male app design team finds women are finding it difficult to use the app as  they don't like the UI. They hire a woman coder to increase diversity and make the app more woman friendly. This is wrong. The problem is the UI  so they should hire a woman UI designer. Even better run dozens of focus groups to get feedback from hundreds of women and use their suggestions rather than a single woman. The coding team hiring should actually be gender blind or agnostic and you should know the gender only after the technical round. The only benchmark should be coding expertise and basic social skills. By confusing diversity and social justice we end up doing neither ",
            "What Ive read - if youre doing everything else very well, diversity helps.  If you arent doing the basic blocking and tackling well, diversity either doesnt help or actually hurts.  If you cant do the basics well, you are likely to not do diversity well either.  And you cant just stick a diversity officer into the management suite and think youve solved it. \n\nHigh performers benefit.  Low performers dont.  Its part of the puzzle but not a fix-all.",
            "Lol, you can't prove to me they've extensively  'tried' Diversity thoroughly enough to dismiss it. Not when the vast majority of managers and CEOs are still white men."
