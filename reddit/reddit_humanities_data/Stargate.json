            "Hi u/JosephMallozzi, hope that we hear news of a new live-action Stargate production in the near future. Given the choice, the best aspects of the original Stargate movie, SG1, SGA, and SGU, all combined, would be ideal for the next one. Fingers crossed we see some positive movement! Also, thanks for sharing the awesome concept art, video clips, and things. Curious to see the winning votes of this poll by the time it closes.",
            "I love the mythology of SG1, and I definitely want to see more of that.  To me, while some of the Goa'uld were great antagonist, the motives were generally the same, and they were one dimensional.   The magic of SG1 wasn't the mythological meanies in my book.  The best, most intriguing antagonists were ourselves, and our \"allies\".  It's the grey areas of morality that 90's science fiction provided with nuance.  Take the Tollan.  What they were going to do to is was unconscionable. Then I have to ask, would our leaders not do the same thing?  And if the answer is no then they kind of suck at protecting us lol.  Then there are the villains who are the heroes in their own stories.  This brings us my absolute favorite (wanna hang out and have a beer) villain which is Maybourne.  The other is definitely my most hated Kinsey.  \n\nAnyway, I love Earth based and mythology, but I hope the focus is on the nuanced storytelling.",
            "I don't care as long as McKay is in it!",
            "SGU was always the one I wanted to see more seasons of, see where it could go. It was really hitting its stride, and then it got canceled. I liked how it made space seem dark, and unforgiving with the more military based perspective.",
            "Like *Stargate Atlantis*. I don't want real-world politics in the new show. Part of the beauty of the *Stargate* series was that it was a nice break from the problems we're facing in our world right now. I think to drag those themes in would kill the hopeful, optimistic spirit of *Stargate*. I'd like continuity to be respected. I want Brad Wright to be in charge, with full creative control. I want twenty episodes per season. And above all, I don't want a reboot.\n\nNone of this is actually going to happen. But I can dream.",
            "Thanks for bringing the poll here! I posted a link to the Twitter poll earlier, and then realized a *lot* of people don't use it.\n\nEdit: Someone else suggested in that thread a show based on the Ancients, something *way* far back in the past, and I think it has merit.",
            "Personally would love to continue years after SGAs ending. Essentially Atlantis somehow becomes public knowledge along with the Stargate program. It becomes the base of Stargate operations for earth. It's run as a cooperative international coalition similar to the Atlantis expedition. I'd love to see Carter at the head of the program. McKay is chief scientist. I would expect the first season to have an element of dealing with the earthside fallout of revealing the Stargate to the public while simultaneously being the lead voice for humans in the milky way. I'd love to see more interplanetary cooperation on a larger scale. There could be a galactic government of sorts that offers possibilities for more political dealings and drama. I'd love to see a more permanent establishment of colonies and expansion of off world sites. There's a lot to play with.",
            "I really need to see the story of SGU finished. Help me Amazon!",
            "Even if its not something actively being discussed, Im happy just knowing youre asking!",
            "What keeps bringing me back to Stargate for views over and over is the world-building. Going from zero idea of wtf is going on with everything so far beyond them, to establishing understanding of technologies and adapting of those technologies to advance significantly over the course of the arc of the show makes it fascinating to watch play out. Would love to see this concept continued on."

            "And the Shuttle only got named that after a petition. \n\nThe original name was supposed to be Constitution.",
            "As someone who worked on the fucking Commando IIs and is working on the Galaxy the ground crews have strong opinions. Tell your buddies on those boards to rename the C5 to FRED, its what the ground crew calls it, thus it is correct, as maintainers are always right, can do no wrong, and are never drunken assholes. Its the pilots who break our perfectly good and sexy planes",
            "To be fair, and I am a trekkie, the first shuttle *should* have been named constitution. Then the first shuttle in space could have been Enteprise and she would have been a constitution class just like the starship",
            "You have to understand, to the USAF, the Russians and Chinese are our adversaries, the US Navy is our enemy. Fund guzzling asshats, those ship funds should go to us!",
            "All my boards involve spacecraft, so best I can do is tell the PMOs to watch it when their military acquisition bodies PCS to a new one. :p",
            "when was the last time someone used the Name Stratofortress for the B52",
            "So who do I have to kill to get it changed, and make the Commando II the Talon III? Or the Fuck These Gears?",
            "Having been on naming boards for several named vehicles in the past, I can tell you why lol.\n\nUsually the naming conventions have to follow certain guidelines that are laid down by the service Secretaries or Directors. For example, naval ships have a bunch depending on type, and NASA spacecraft such as the shuttle (with the exception of Enterprise as that was via petition) were named after ships of antiquity.\n\nSince the U.S fleet of spacecraft are under the control of the Air Force, then the naming would come from the Air Force Program Management Office that manages the ships. Funny thing is, many crews end up not liking the official names (for example, F-16 pilots calling it the Viper instead of the Fighting Falcon), so it's possible to have a craft with a formal and informal nickname (another example; the A-10 being the Thunderbolt II but informally the Warthog). \n\nUsually by the time it's flight ready and crewed, the name has already been decided and attached. If O'Neill wanted to call it Enterprise informally, there's technically nothing stopping him. But considering Prometheus, Odyssey, and Daedalus, it's pretty obvious the PMO decided on a convention based on Greek mythology, with the exception of the Hammond, which was originally supposed to be called the Phoenix, which I guarantee had a waiver granted by the SECAF.\n\n\nSo the TL;DR: because it's not attached to Greek mythology. :p"

            "I liked her appearances but I felt they went **too** hard on her being right and the good guy in the dynamic and Rodney just being a dick.\n\nThe bit that rubbed me the wrong way was when she deliberately went out of her way to tell his team all his embarrassing secrets (and genuinely embarrassing ones at that) not out of fun or misjudged sibling humour but, as she self-admits, in an attempt to hurt him because she felt he deserved it.\n\nI think if shed appeared a final time in S5 it wouldve been good to have her be the one to fuck up, badly, and Rodney has to save the day.",
