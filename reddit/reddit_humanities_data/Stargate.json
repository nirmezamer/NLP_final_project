            "Twitter:\n\n[Jo Mallozzi's Twitter for alternate polls](https://twitter.com/BaronDestructo)\n\nOther Reddit Polls:\n\n[Poll 2 \"What should the new series be?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/11wo6f7/question_2_what_should_the_new_stargate_series_be/)\n\n[Poll 3 \"Where should the new Stargate series be set?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/11xp9i9/new_poll_where_should_the_new_stargate_series_be/)",
            "Hi u/JosephMallozzi, hope that we hear news of a new live-action Stargate production in the near future. Given the choice, the best aspects of the original Stargate movie, SG1, SGA, and SGU, all combined, would be ideal for the next one. Fingers crossed we see some positive movement! Also, thanks for sharing the awesome concept art, video clips, and things. Curious to see the winning votes of this poll by the time it closes.",
            "Given how much time has passed, I'd really like to see a show that re-centers us on the core of Stargate: a team of people who live on Earth in the present and who have an \"adventure of the week\" through the Stargate. With occasional multi-episode arcs (but mostly episodic).\n\nI don't have a strong preference around particular plot points. Part of what I liked about the show was the writers' ability to present new scenarios each week that I hadn't thought of \ud83d\ude01\n\nAlso, animation isn't off the table for me. I'd rather see a decent animated show than nothing at all. And animation does provide some unique opportunities for aliens that don't conform to the human-in-makeup form \ud83e\udd14",
            "I love the mythology of SG1, and I definitely want to see more of that.  To me, while some of the Goa'uld were great antagonist, the motives were generally the same, and they were one dimensional.   The magic of SG1 wasn't the mythological meanies in my book.  The best, most intriguing antagonists were ourselves, and our \"allies\".  It's the grey areas of morality that 90's science fiction provided with nuance.  Take the Tollan.  What they were going to do to is was unconscionable. Then I have to ask, would our leaders not do the same thing?  And if the answer is no then they kind of suck at protecting us lol.  Then there are the villains who are the heroes in their own stories.  This brings us my absolute favorite (wanna hang out and have a beer) villain which is Maybourne.  The other is definitely my most hated Kinsey.  \n\nAnyway, I love Earth based and mythology, but I hope the focus is on the nuanced storytelling.",
            "I don't care as long as McKay is in it!",
            "SGU was always the one I wanted to see more seasons of, see where it could go. It was really hitting its stride, and then it got canceled. I liked how it made space seem dark, and unforgiving with the more military based perspective.",
            "Like *Stargate Atlantis*. I don't want real-world politics in the new show. Part of the beauty of the *Stargate* series was that it was a nice break from the problems we're facing in our world right now. I think to drag those themes in would kill the hopeful, optimistic spirit of *Stargate*. I'd like continuity to be respected. I want Brad Wright to be in charge, with full creative control. I want twenty episodes per season. And above all, I don't want a reboot.\n\nNone of this is actually going to happen. But I can dream.",
            "Thanks for bringing the poll here! I posted a link to the Twitter poll earlier, and then realized a *lot* of people don't use it.\n\nEdit: Someone else suggested in that thread a show based on the Ancients, something *way* far back in the past, and I think it has merit.",
            "Personally would love to continue years after SGAs ending. Essentially Atlantis somehow becomes public knowledge along with the Stargate program. It becomes the base of Stargate operations for earth. It's run as a cooperative international coalition similar to the Atlantis expedition. I'd love to see Carter at the head of the program. McKay is chief scientist. I would expect the first season to have an element of dealing with the earthside fallout of revealing the Stargate to the public while simultaneously being the lead voice for humans in the milky way. I'd love to see more interplanetary cooperation on a larger scale. There could be a galactic government of sorts that offers possibilities for more political dealings and drama. I'd love to see a more permanent establishment of colonies and expansion of off world sites. There's a lot to play with.",
            "What about a completely different race, long after humanity has ended, in their own fledgling Stargate program, finding relics of the Tau\u2019ri.\n\nWe could simultaneously be the Ancients, while also seeing the tech left behind.\n\nCould explain the differing levels as new colonies got hand me down tech until more could be shipped, so the outer edges of Tau\u2019ri space has the most rudimentary, and then slowly backwards to more advanced.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAnother could be a diplomatic style political show.  Sort of like the Senate from Star Wars, as humanity rose onto the galactic stage.  Would echo back to the fifth race foreshadowing, except maybe we are helping nurture the races that came after."

            "I like that actor whats-his-name who plays Lucius too much to \"despise the character\" per se but he's certainly no harmless villain.  He's (Richard Kind) in the original Stargate film as well as you may or may not recall."

            "Yeah, the risk vs reward in this scenario is way out of proportion. McKay was pretty dumb in this episode. They could have spent as long as they wanted studying the generator, not to mention the weapon it was attached to.
