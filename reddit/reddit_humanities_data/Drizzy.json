            "I agree with you 100%. \n\nTo me this whole beef is indicative of a larger societal problem. \n\nFirst you have the age old idea of tearing people down to build them back up. People absolutely love the underdog story. When you get too big, you\u2019re no longer relatable in that way and so the envy and jealousy makes you resented. But after you get torn down, you can be an underdog again and people build you back up. It\u2019s just ironic that people are really rooting for millionaire, critically acclaimed Kenny. But he\u2019s behind Drake. \n\nPeople forget, as much as Michael Jordan is a legend, people hated him and called him overrated while he was winning. They do the same thing to LeBron now. Then in 10 years the same people will be telling their kids \u201cman, I was so lucky to get to watch LeBron.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also part of the social media age where algorithms cause these positive/negative feedback loops. Opinions become narratives which become \u201cfacts.\u201d It\u2019s kinda depressing. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk."
