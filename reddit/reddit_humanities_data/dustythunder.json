Like the DEFCON levels, 1 is the worst, and 4 is the least severe level.  \n  \nIt was created by Dusty Thunder in a random moment some time in 2022, but it stuck, and the ASCON\u00a0Scale has since become a staple of Dusty's content as well as a useful tool to many people as they seek to identify levels of assholery in their daily encounters.\n\nThis is copied from [dustythunder.com](http://dustythunder.com)"

        "content": "Backstory,  I (F45) was married long ago and during that marriage my ex-husband and sister had an affair.  My sister had a set of twin girls.  My ex-husand left and I didn't find out until years later that they were his.  \n\nMy dad passed away suddenly in 2019. My sister decided to go homeless.  My husband felt bad and offered to take my nieces in so they wouldn't be homeless with their mom.  We tried helping my sister but she was also battling addiction and our things would disappear.  It was too much.  Their biological father will not claim them and his son from third marriage says girls only want to be in his life is because the family is rich.  His wife has a PHD and is a big shot in our local school district.  His mom won the Powerball back in 2002 right before my ex-husband and I were married.  \n\nAnyways.  My husband and I have gotten the twins graduated high school.  They are now 20 and are going to start their second year of college this fall.  \n\nI don't know what to do anymore.  I ask for help with chores and they say we are just using them as slaves.  Now that they are over 18, we ask that they help pay some bills.  They want to see our bills and see what we have to pay.  They are constantly asking why we are struggling and why we can't pay our bills with just one paycheck.  I work two jobs since last August.  \n\nToday I asked for $50 because one of twins upgraded their phone.  She said that's not what she owes because they told her it was only going to be $25.  I was so angry.  I told her I would just pay it.  I ask her how long she had left in school.  She was it just depends.  I told her and her sister need to hurry up, finish school and leave.",

When we first got together, Alex told me he has a daughter, at the time she was 3, lets call her Bee.\n \nSo for a bit of background knowledge, Alex is not Bee's bio dad. He just stepped up to be dad, which I think was amazing. Alex and his ex, Bee's mom, had been on and off for a few years before he and I got together. When we got together and I met Bee, I fell in love with her. BM of course was not happy that I was in the picture now. She did everything she can to scare me off, causing all sorts of drama and fights. Although BM was putting a strain on my mental health and my relationship, I stayed because I love Alex and loved Bee as if she were my own. She was the first kid who called me mom. \n\nFast forward to when Bee was 7 years old. After another heated argument, which this one turned physical (BM slapped me for trying to push her away from me when she was yelling at me in my face). BM took Bee away from us. Unfortunately Alex has no legal say in anything to do with Bee. \n\nFast forward 7 years, Bee is now 14 years old. Alex and I are married and have a daughter of our own who is 5 let's call her Ray. We don't really know Bee like we used to. We only see her maybe once a month for a couple hours when my in laws have her on their time allowed by BM. As of now, we want Ray to see Bee as a friend, not a sister. Ray is too young to understand this very complicated situation we are in with Bee and her mom. Ray is already asking questions on why she can't see and be with her sister because other people have told Ray that Bee is her sister (this was done without me or Alex knowing). I made it clear to Ray that Bee is her friend. I don't want her getting confused and hurt as to why Bee is not around. Alex and I will explain everything to her and help her understand better about this when she is older. But for now, to Ray's knowledge, she is an only child. \nSo, AITAH for wanting to tell my in laws to not tell my daughter that their \"adoptive\" granddaughter is not my daughter's sister?",

If you say she\u2019s \u2019just a friend\u2019 whilst other people you can\u2019t control are clearly calling her a sister then not only is she likely to be confused but you\u2019ll also be undoing a lie sometime in the future. She\u2019s not really a sister or a friend, as others have said step sister is probably the closest term, which may well be shortened to sister. 5 year olds can understand a lot, but they also don\u2019t have the same inbuilt social understanding of what\u2019s complicated. So this is no more complicated to explain to her than where babies come from or why don\u2019t I have a grandpa or whatever.\n\n\u2018Before me and your daddy met and had you he lived with BM and helped take care of Bee. Later on after me and your daddy got married Bee still came to stay with us and we helped look after her too so she saw us both like an extra mum and dad. It\u2019s been a long time since me and daddy helped look after Bee like an extra mummy and daddy, so she\u2019s not really your sister, but that\u2019s why some people call her your sister, because she\u2019s an extra special person to us. There isn\u2019t really a word for what Bee is to you, but some people might use the word step sister. You can call her your friend, your sister or your step sister, whatever feels like the right word to you.\u2019\n\nYes there might be additional questions, and if you lay the groundwork of understanding what relationships are and that they sometimes end (info she may already understand) then explaining who BM is becomes even easier.",
