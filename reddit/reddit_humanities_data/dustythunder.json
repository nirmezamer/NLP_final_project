My ex-husand left and I didn't find out until years later that they were his.  \n\nMy dad passed away suddenly in 2019. My sister decided to go homeless.  My husband felt bad and offered to take my nieces in so they wouldn't be homeless with their mom.  We tried helping my sister but she was also battling addiction and our things would disappear.  It was too much.  Their biological father will not claim them and his son from third marriage says girls only want to be in his life is because the family is rich.  His wife has a PHD and is a big shot in our local school district.  His mom won the Powerball back in 2002 right before my ex-husband and I were married.  \n\nAnyways.  My husband and I have gotten the twins graduated high school.  They are now 20 and are going to start their second year of college this fall.  \n\nI don't know what to do anymore.  I ask for help with chores and they say we are just using them as slaves.  Now that they are over 18, we ask that they help pay some bills.  They want to see our bills and see what we have to pay.  They are constantly asking why we are struggling and why we can't pay our bills with just one paycheck.  I work two jobs since last August.  \n\nToday I asked for $50 because one of twins upgraded their phone.  She said that's not what she owes because they told her it was only going to be $25.  I was so angry.  I told her I would just pay it.  I ask her how long she had left in school.  She was it just depends.  I told her and her sister need to hurry up, finish school and leave.",

        "content": "Wow. With this being my first reddit post, I didn't really know what to expect. I do appreciate all the comments and what everyone thinks of this. (link to first post at bottom)  \nJust some more things I want to put out there to clarify some of what others have been talking about;\n\nAlex is NOT Bee's bio dad. Alex and his ex were never married. Alex's family basically took her in when she was a teen and pregnant. She was already pregnant when they got together. They were on and off for a few years. My husband has no legal claim to Bee.\n\nMy in laws are the ones who have time with Bee. But only the time that is allowed by BM. When my in laws have her, sometimes we get to see Bee as well, but that is only maybe about 6 or 8 times a year(sorry I should have been more clear about that). BM is very controlling with who on my husband's side gets to see Bee. When BM knows that my in laws are using their time with her to take her to see us or other family, BM threatens to take Bee away from them as well.\n\nMy husband and I still love and care for Bee. But we know that things are not the same between her and us anymore. We barely know her now. But the few times we do see her, we still treat her like family even though she doesn't really talk to us as much. We didn't cut her out of our lives, she was taken away from us by BM.\n\nRay doesn't see Bee as a sister right now. She just says Bee is her sister because that is what she is being told to by others. Ray doesn't fully understand what a sister is. She often times calls some of her friends or cousins sister.\n\nWhen Ray was born, we told my in laws that for now, we would like them to no try to tell Ray that Bee a sister but more of like a close family friend. But now that Ray is getting older, they are telling her Bee is a sister.\n\nMy husband and I are going to tell Ray of who Bee really is to us and the family and the situation around all that. This whole thing a just a big messed up complicated situation that'll be difficult to try to explain to a 5 year old. Yes I know kids are smart, but also every kid is different and comprehends things differently. Which is why I said we wanted to wait till she is a bit older and can understand these things better. And why we wanted Ray to see Bee as a family friend first. We were never planning on lying and keeping all this info from her. Later on, Ray can decide herself how she sees Bee as.\n\nI know we don't really have a say in how the family and Bee handles everything. But we do have a say in how it can be handled in our daughter's situation. We do plan on talking to Ray(to a certain extent as to where she can understand) soon, especially now that the sister topic is coming up more frequently.\n\nI'm sorry if all this is still doesn't make sense and that others don't agree with how I'm handling this. I've tried to explain the whole ordeal as best as I can. There is still so many things I can say but that'll just make this post longer than it already is.  \nWe know that not everyone that is involved in this situation will be happy with how we handle things, whether it is his family or Bee. But our priority is our daughter, Ray, and we will do what is best for her.  \nThank you all for your input. My husband and I will try to handle this as best as we can.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1dqfc2u/aitah\\_for\\_wanting\\_to\\_tell\\_my\\_in\\_laws\\_to\\_not\\_tell/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1dqfc2u/aitah_for_wanting_to_tell_my_in_laws_to_not_tell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

            "I dont know how so many people had missed the obvious information that Alex was not the biological father.\n\nI still stand by what I said before (that I doubt you saw but might now!) that children dont have the same understanding of what is socially complex as us and its easier to build more understanding upon the truth than admit you told a lie. Rae probably already understands girlfriends and boyfriends in a loose sense so you can explain that daddy and BM used to be gf/bf when Bee was a baby and because of that Alex helped take care of bee and acted a bit like an extra dad even though he isnt. When you and daddy got married Bee used to come and stay a lot so Bee saw both you and daddy a bit like and extra mum/dad. However now shes older you dont see her as much (you might need an answer prepared for why? - could be something along the lines of BM no longer needs the extra help now Bee is older, or because its been a long time since daddy and BM were gf/bf, Bee is just more grown now might even suffice). Thats why some people say shes your sister even though shes not an actual sister and its fine for her to call Rae whatever she wants.\n\nWhat you present as not complicated to a child will seem non complicated to a child! Being told by different people she is, or is not a sister with no context is much more likely to be confusing to her!\n\nBest of luck, and sorry you guys had Bee taken away from you, that must have been heartbreaking for Alex especially",
            "OP, both your original post and this update are very clear. Your inlaws are overstepping with Ray in a big way and are causing nothing but confusion. You are handling things very well. I just wanted to share a tip. I am an adoptive mom of 3, and we are very open about it with our kids. The older 2 came together and are full siblings. The youngest joined later and is a half sibling (same birth mom). Although we as a family don't say half brother or consider him differently, he is biracial, and the rest of us are Caucasian. When he joined the family, they were 5 and 3, I drew out a family tree to help the older two understand the dynamics. As they have gotten older, I have expanded this to include the fact that there are actually other older and younger maternal and paternal half siblings, but that's another story. Art/visuals are a great way to help little kids understand these things. Using dolls is another idea. You are doing great. It must have been so hard to have Bee be pulled out of your lives like that, and for Bee too. I wish you and your family all the best."
