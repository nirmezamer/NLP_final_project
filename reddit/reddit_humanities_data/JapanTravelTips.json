        "content": "Got a question about JR Passes or IC cards (Suica/Pasmo/ICOCA/etc)? Read through the information below and feel free to ask additional questions in this thread! Please [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/search/?q=%22Do%20you%20have%20a%20JR%20Pass%20or%20IC%20Card%20(Suica%2FPasmo%2Fetc.)%20question%3F%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) for old versions of this megathread.\n\n## JR Pass Info\n\nThe nationwide JR Pass is a travel pass that allows train and bus travel for a fixed cost over a certain period of days on Japan Railways (JR) services. For a comprehensive source of information on the pass, check out [our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/) or [Japan Guide\u2019s JR Pass page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html).\n\nThe JR Pass can be purchased in one of two ways:\n* Online at the [official site](https://japanrailpass.net/en/)\n* Online from an authorized retailer (also often called a \"third-party seller\")\n\nThere is no way to be certain if a JR Pass will be valuable for you without knowing your exact itinerary and doing the math out. If you are trying to work out whether a JR Pass is the right choice for you, here are some calculators:\n* [JRPass.com\u2019s calculator](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator)\n* [Japan Guide\u2019s calculator](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/)\n* [Daisuki calculator](https://www.daisuki.com.br/jrpass_calculator.html)\n\n**As of October 1, 2023, the nationwide JR Pass and regional JR Passes have increased in price significantly.** The price increase makes it so that there are _very few itineraries_ that the nationwide JR Pass will be worth it for. For more information and discussion on the price increase, see [this search result of prior discussion threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search/?q=jr+pass+increase).\n\n## IC Card Info (Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA, etc.)\n\n### General Information\n\nAn IC card is a stored-value card used to pay for transportation in Japan. That means you can load the card with money and use the card to pay for trains, buses, etc by tapping the card at train station gates or fare readers. Even if you have a JR Pass or other travel pass, an IC card is recommended because it can be used across transportation systems operated by many different transit companies, as well as for payment at convenience stores, restaurants, shops, vending machines, and other locations.\n\nFor tourism purposes, there are nine major IC cards and all of them are completely interchangeable and usable in each other's regions, so it doesn\u2019t really matter which one you get. Where you start your travels in Japan often dictates what IC card you get, since different IC cards originate in different regions, but then you'll be able to use it during most of your traveling, even if you move to a different region. For general information on IC cards, see [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/) or [Japan Guide\u2019s IC card page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html).\n\n## Physical IC Cards\n\nCurrently, sales of regular Suica, named Suica, regular Pasmo, and named Pasmo cards [are _technically_ suspended due to a semiconductor shortage](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/sale-of-pasmo-and-suica-cards-suspended-except-those-for-tourists-080223) (except children's versions and commuter versions). That said, there have been recent reports in early 2024 of people getting regular Suica cards at some stations in Tokyo.\n\n**If you are landing in/starting your trip in Tokyo,** tourists can still get:\n\n* A [Welcome Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html) at Haneda Airport (HND) or a [Pasmo Passport](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/) at both Tokyo airports (HND and NRT) (**Note:** Pasmo Passport will be discontinued in August 2024, and may be subject to limited availability before then, based on supply)\n* _Possibly_ a regular Suica at some major JR East stations in Tokyo (subject to limited availability)\n* _Possibly_ a [Toica IC card](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/tickets/buy/toica/) at the JR Central portions of Tokyo Station (Yaesu North Exit) and Shinagawa Station (Shinkansen North Exit) (subject to limited availability)\n* A  digital IC card (see next section for more information)\n\nA Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport acts exactly like a regular IC card, with two exceptions: it is only valid for 28 days, and it cannot be refunded. Please see [this thread and its top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/15ebhwb/issuing_of_personalized_suica_and_pasmo_cards_is/) for information.\n\n**If you are starting your trip in another region** (e.g., Kansai, Kyushu, etc.), sales of their regional IC cards are unaffected by Suica and Pasmo shortages. Please see [this page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) to identify which card you'll get, and it should be available at airports and train stations in those regions.\n\n### Digital IC Cards\n\nIf you are looking to get a digital IC card, please note that digital Suica, Pasmo, and ICOCA cards can only be used on iPhones, Apple Watches, or *Japanese* Android phones (this means the phone was purchased in Japan). For instructions on how to get a digital IC card in Apple Wallet, see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207155). You _do not_ need the Suica or Pasmo apps (which are all in Japanese) in order to get a digital IC card. It can be loaded and used entirely through Apple Wallet.\n\nPlease note that not all credit cards work to load a digital IC card. Amex cards seem to have the highest success rate, but Mastercards and Visas can be flaky. Although Visa previously didn't work at all, as of December 2023, loading a digital Suica with some Visa credits cards seems to work, although not all of them. See this [At A Distance blog post](https://atadistance.net/all-about-apple-pay-suica-recharge/) for more info and updates. It is not uncommon to not have any of your cards work to load a digital IC card, and if that happens, you might need to stick with a physical IC card.\n\nKeep in mind that digital IC cards cannot be refunded (that requires a Japanese bank account), so you will need to burn down whatever value you\u2019ve loaded onto them before the end of your trip.\n\n### IC Card FAQ\n\n**I have an old IC card from a previous trip. Can I use it on my upcoming trip?**\n\n> IC cards are valid for ten years after their last date of use, so if you received the card and/or used the card in/after 2014, it\u2019ll work.\n\n**Can more than one person use the same IC card for travel?**\n\n> No. All travelers who want to use IC cards on transit need to have their own card. Most transit in Japan is distance-based, and the card is \u201ckeeping track\u201d of your journey, and it can only keep track of one at a time.\n\n**Are there children\u2019s IC cards? How do I get one for my child?**\n\n> Children under six years old can ride transit for free. If your child is between the ages of six and eleven, you can get a children\u2019s IC card from JR offices by presenting the child\u2019s passport for proof of age. There are also Welcome Suica and Pasmo Passport versions for children. If you are getting IC cards at the airport, they are able to provide children\u2019s cards.\n\n**Can I load money onto a physical IC card with a credit card?**\n\n> No. Physical IC cards can only be loaded with cash, which can be done at ticket machines in train stations, convenience stores, and 7-Eleven ATMs. \n\n**I have a physical IC card and I want to transfer it to my phone. If I do that, can I still use the physical card?**\n\n> No. Once you \u201cmove\u201d the physical card to your phone and turn it into a digital card, the physical card becomes invalid. It cannot be used or reactivated.\n\n**I\u2019m landing in Tokyo, but then I\u2019m going to Osaka and Kyoto. Do I need a suica in Tokyo and then an ICOCA in Osaka/Kyoto?**\n\n> No. Once you have one of the major IC cards, it can be used pretty much anywhere. There are some exceptions to this, but they are mostly on individual lines or in specific rural regions. If you are traveling to major tourism cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, etc., you are likely fine with whatever IC card you originally received upon arrival.\n\n**Should I buy an IC card online before arriving in Japan?**\n\n> If you want to get an IC card online from a reputable vendor, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Some of the authorized JR Pass website (as well as other websites targeted at tourists) will sell them bundled with other purchases. That said, there isn\u2019t really any reason to get your card ahead of time. If you\u2019re landing in Tokyo, the 28-day Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport is good enough for most tourists. And if you do end up in the country for longer than 28 days, you can simply get an IC card from another region once you\u2019re in one (such as the ICOCA from Kansai).\n\n**Help! I tried to load my digital IC card through Apple Wallet and the transaction didn't go through! What do I do?**\n\n> To start, did you attempt to create it/load it overnight in Japan? The digital system goes down for maintenance from about 1am to 5am JST, so try again during Japan's daytime hours. Beyond that, Visa cards often cannot be used to load digital IC cards. Mastercards sometimes have issues too, depending on the issuing bank. Unfortunately, if you can't find a digital card + credit card combo that works for you, you may not be able to use digital IC cards.\n\n### Recent IC Card Threads\n\nTo see some recent discussion on IC cards, check out [the following threads from our search results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/search/?q=IC+card).",

            "I can confirm from last week that you can indeed get Suica cards again. I got mine and my daughters childrens one at Tokyo station and a friend got one at Ikebukuro.",
            "I understand each person needs their own IC card but if you're reserving seats or paying a supplement (e.g. for Nozomi or other express train) does each person need to do it individually or can one person do it for the group?",
            "I saw a notice that SUICA card sales will be suspended on June 8 on their website. Does anyone know more about this?",
            "So just to clarify, assuming I want to avoid the JR Pass - if I want to travel across regions (Tokyo > Kyoto > Hiroshima, etc), I have to get an individual JR ticket for the trip (either regular train or Shinkansen)? Then, within any region, IC cards are good for most travel (unless trying to use a JR specific train line)?",
            "As of 6/21 at Narita Terminal 2, Pasmo Passport at the Skyliner and Keisei info center and regular Suica at the JR East travel center both available for purchase.",
            "# Can I buy a JR pass for me and my husband with my credit card, or do we both need to use separate credit card?\n\n  \nI understand from reading other posts that the official place to buy the JR Pass is\u00a0[https://japanrailpass.net/](https://japanrailpass.net/). Is this correct?\n\nWe are planning several long distance trips during our stay in Japan and believe the JR pass will be worth it for us.\n\nI also understand that if we buy the JR pass from the official website, when we get to Japan, we will need to present our passports with the temporary visitor stamp, the numbers in the reservation code sent to our email, and \\*the same credit card used to purchase the JR pass, in the same name as the traveler.\\*\n\nAs per the website, it says \"Payment can only be made with a credit card. The credit card must be in the purchaser's name. For children who do not have their own credit cards, the JAPAN RAIL PASS can be purchased if the itinerary is the same as that of the person who is making the payment.\"\n\nIt specifically mentions children, but would it be okay for me to also pay for a JR pass for my husband using my credit card?\n\nAnother complicating factor is that I have a US passport and he has a Colombian passport. I don't know if that makes any difference.\n\nI hope my question makes sense, and I really appreciate any help you can give me!"
