            "I\u2019m hoping the tactics end up being more in depth but it looks like a fresh coat of paint on what we already had.",
            "Embarrassing. 2nd year in a row the main new feature are cutscenes that nobody will watch after the first week of release",
            "Disappointing but not surprising. Being able to watch the full match without playing is a good feature, other notable changes are just cutscenes really. Adding coaches doesn't really add any immersion imo, just adds another menu and will likely be broken and give your players huge boosts. Hoping the training drills at the start of every career are gone, worried that there's going to be even more training from watching that though.",
            "What's the point of the touchline camera angle if your manager is just blocking your view of the pitch?",
            "Once again, they're just re-introducing features that used to exist in career mode literal decades ago, FIFA 07 manager mode had [coaches](https://guides.gamepressure.com/fifa07/gfx/word/314966984.jpg) that would help increase player attributes and FIFA 10 had [pre-match reports](https://www.swiftworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/FIFA-10-Pre-Match.jpg) on the team you were about to play.",
            "Interesting to see how impactful the pre-match reports will be. But overall, underwhelming yet again",
            "Prediction...if Real sell their  pacey wingers Carlo won't change his management style.",
            "My expectations couldn\u2019t have been lower and I\u2019m still disappointed lol. I just want to know how this is the only sports title on the planet that we can\u2019t track everyone\u2019s stats on a year to year basis and look back on. Like if I want to see how a striker performed during the 2024/2025 season while playing in the 2026/2027 season I should be able to. We as lovers of this game aren\u2019t asking for much but they can\u2019t even give us the bare minimum that other sports titles give us. I play FIFA (EAFC) to play the games becuz I want to play them but man I\u2019ve been playing FM the last few years and I\u2019ll give this game one more shot and that\u2019s that, I may fully switch to FM especially if they deliver what sounds like cool shit in FM25 with revamped graphics engine (finally).",
            "Hoping that I can just set-and-forget the training and not have to deal with it much",
            "Couple of useless cutscenes added every year instead of that focus on online or atleast coop career mode EA"

            "Yes but why would they fix the gameplay? Smh",
            "How about they just let us put the mask over players like we can in player career?",

I get that maybe it puts an emphasis on the YA (they\u2019ve been mostly broken anyways, especially since dynamic potential), but it would be nice if I could bring a player over the age of 30 to an important match once in a while"
