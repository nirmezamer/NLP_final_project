            "Im hoping the tactics end up being more in depth but it looks like a fresh coat of paint on what we already had.",
            "Embarrassing. 2nd year in a row the main new feature are cutscenes that nobody will watch after the first week of release",
            "Disappointing but not surprising. Being able to watch the full match without playing is a good feature, other notable changes are just cutscenes really. Adding coaches doesn't really add any immersion imo, just adds another menu and will likely be broken and give your players huge boosts. Hoping the training drills at the start of every career are gone, worried that there's going to be even more training from watching that though.",
            "What's the point of the touchline camera angle if your manager is just blocking your view of the pitch?",
            "Interesting to see how impactful the pre-match reports will be. But overall, underwhelming yet again",
            "Prediction...if Real sell their  pacey wingers Carlo won't change his management style.",
            "My expectations couldnt have been lower and Im still disappointed lol. I just want to know how this is the only sports title on the planet that we cant track everyones stats on a year to year basis and look back on. Like if I want to see how a striker performed during the 2024/2025 season while playing in the 2026/2027 season I should be able to. We as lovers of this game arent asking for much but they cant even give us the bare minimum that other sports titles give us. I play FIFA (EAFC) to play the games becuz I want to play them but man Ive been playing FM the last few years and Ill give this game one more shot and thats that, I may fully switch to FM especially if they deliver what sounds like cool shit in FM25 with revamped graphics engine (finally).",
            "Hoping that I can just set-and-forget the training and not have to deal with it much",
            "Couple of useless cutscenes added every year instead of that focus on online or atleast coop career mode EA",
            "Only thing I want is youth teams, and again I get disappointed. Even PES had Youth Teams like 2-3 years ago, can't be that difficult. Just some players in a league and you can see how they perform match by match with their performance influencing their potential."
