It's a big deal; when I lived in the UK, it was a fight to get tickets every time.\n\nAnd that's the big piece; tickets sell out long before the lineup is announced.\n\nWhen I realized Seventeen would be performing here, my first feeling was honestly nerves - kpop groups often rely on their fandoms when it comes to festivals such as this. In fact, festivals will book big kpop acts TO attract huge crowds, because kpop fans know how to show up.\n\nBut for this one, there was no way for fans to get tickets; maybe, at most 500 Carats were able to find people reselling. But I have multiple friends who have been looking for tickets for months before - it's very very hard.\n\nSo the reality was that they would be playing to a (likely smaller) audience, of people who had never heard their music, on a stage at 2:45 PM on the first day of the festival. Majority of these fans would also be english speaking brits. The odds were utterly stacked against them.\n\n**But WOW oh wow, did they show up and show out.** Was it the biggest crowd they've played to? Not at all. But it didn't need to be. I want to commend Seventeen for being such strong performers above all else; they know how to engage a crowd, they know how to freakin SING, they know how to have fun with their craft.\n\nI loved when it panned to the crowd and you could see grown men in t-shirts for other artists at the festival, jumping and smiling ear-to-ear. I was moved to tears a couple of times, though I really encourage people to watch the entire set, or at the first least the last five minutes where they did the infinite Aju Nice.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of the entire show was seeing Seungkwan dancing and holding the hands of excited middle aged ladies who seemed to be having the time of their life!! And then Seungkwan's adorable interaction with a little girl. So incredible. [Here is a link!](https://x.com/moeum_zip/status/1806700042960712191)\n\nFrom [Headliner ](https://x.com/sounds_of_cheol/status/1806698419995681248)to [Cheers to Youth](https://x.com/adoraboole/status/1806697681798226335), Seventeen know how to move a crowd that knows nothing about them. As Joshua said, music is the bridge between language and culture.\n\nAnd this performance showed that Kpop doesn't need to just exist within its little bubble of super fans; it deserves to have a spotlight on a more global stage, and I really hope this performance showed people how incredible the genre can be!\n\nEdit:\n\nGoing to add some more clips of performances as I come across them on X :)\n\n[Cheers to Youth](https://x.com/gyupachups/status/1806703011894567132)\n\n[Hoshi hyping up the crowd for HOT](https://x.com/miwon17_/status/1806699001280159996)\n\n[Full Aju Nice performance,](https://x.com/joshu_jihanist/status/1806701240740462931) [Never-ending Aju Nice](https://x.com/shua_enthusiast/status/1806701151674597550) and [Seungkwan crowd interaction!](https://x.com/adoraboole/status/1806702768855601444)\n\n[KUNG CHI PAK CHI](https://x.com/minghaocheol_/status/1806718668086325408)",

They obviously know how to engage with and hype the crowd (seriously, hoshi is a mind blowing hype man his adlibs are so engaging I was so hyped in my bedroom like I was at the festival itself and seungkwan\u2019s interactions with the audience, regardless old and young were so hilarious and adorable to watch) and it\u2019s amazing to see their energy being reciprocated by the audience, seriously the best, most receptive and open-minded audience I\u2019ve seen in festivals. \n\nI love it when performers look like they\u2019re having complete fub on stage and nothing else matters and that was exactly how it felt watching their set. Given the positive reception I\u2019m seeing all over twitter right now even from non-svt fans, I hope they are invited to headline Glastonbury next year!",
            "Just logged in to my account to see if anyone had written a post about it and if not, I was going to write one myself. I am feeling a myriad of emotions rn. UK is a place where k-pop market is smaller as compared to many other countries of the world, and performing at Glasto on top of that, which is not only attended but was also live-streamed in its entirety this time across UK, had me feeling all kinds of nerves for them. SVT was not only presenting themselves infront of a crowd of locals, but also representing k-pop. Their performance could have possibly determined if Glasto organisers will invite k-pop groups in the coming years. So yes, the stakes felt pretty high. But as they performed and I saw a happy audience, chanting, hyping them up, putting their hands up in the air for them, I started feeling emotional. Emotional of the history they were making, emotional of how non-fans were also praising their hard-work and music. Seungkwan being hugged by a giddy aunt, Mingyu being waved to and fist-bumped by male audience and the crowd going crazy during aju nice, everything felt like a dream to witness.\n\n  \nAs soon as their set ended, I logged in to my Twitter account and all I came across was praises from the people who watched their set live or on TV. Seungcheol once said that SVT will make sure that Carats are never ashamed of calling themselves their fans and they stand by those words with every performance. I am so, so proud of them :')",

            "I clicked that Hoshi link and I'm sold. Thanks OP!",
            "I\u2019m so happy and proud of them!! They did amazing and the set list was so well chosen! I was a tiny bit worried about crowd receptiveness bc of how they were announced after tickets had sold out, but I needn\u2019t have been! I\u2019ve always felt like British and Irish gig/festival goers just  really go for it and can find something to enjoy in almost any act, and it was really great to see that play out here!",

        "content": "A day or so ago, Jaejoong's special episode for Jaefriends was uploaded on Youtube. I don't generally keep up with his show, but the special MC for the episode was Younghoon of TBZ so I checked it out. The reason they had a special MC for this episode is because this time around, Jaejoong is promoting his own music as he is releasing a 20th anniversary full album, with the title track Glorious Days and the pre-release I am You.\n\nIt starts sweet and such, however at around the 16 minute mark, \"private\" fans (I believe it means sasaengs or stalker fans) are brought up. TVXQ are known for having probably some of the the worst cases of stalker fans when it comes to K-pop and Jaejoong talks about a few of his experiences in this ep. He talks about an instance where he was home and got a photo message from an unknown number. It was a photo of his back, sitting at a table or desk, while he was at home. The person had snuck into his house, taken a photo and then sent Jaejoong the photo once they had left the house. He also mentions that another \"private\" fan had kissed Jaejoong while he was sleeping (the whole crew reacts in shock horror at Jaejoong's casual remark). He even says that verbatim \"If that happened now, she might have gone to jail\". He then says that he felt like he was living like a prison and he only felt happy when \"they\" (stalker fans) would leave him alone.\n\nJaejoong also says that he's grateful to IU, bc she sued stalker fans who crossed the line which made it quote \"easier\" for other celebrities in Korea to do so, likely to her good image in Korea. The subject is switched after that, but I was left reeling at how casually (yet clearly affected) Jaejoong spoke of otherwise terrifying experiences. He even mentioned that moving house wouldn't really alleviate the stalking issue, which goes to show how deranged some stalkers can get.\n\nI didn't post this to try to put blame on any company, the fan culture or even South Korea's laws but I think it's so heartbreaking that so many of these idols, men and women, can probably relate to these horrifying experiences that Jaejoong talked briefly about. I know that they're rich and pretty and won't deal with many life issues that regular folk would, but I can't help but feel sad for them bc the most basic things like privacy is violated so often and so uncaringly and these idols aren't seen as actual people by these kinds of \"fans\". It isn't out of love, but out of obsession and possession, which much be so much to wrap one's head around. I truly believe that humans aren't designed to be famous, bc how do you come to terms that you're life is taken so superficially to others? Especially, when all you want to do is produce and perform music? Boggles my mind.\n\n**edit**: here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIY3wWyRpwE) to the ep. ",

Idk how people can be so comfortable committing literal crimes just because they\u2019re obsessed with an idol, but I need the companies to step up and actually do something about these sasaengs. Because a lot of them went unpunished for so long, they get way too bold.",
            "Sandra Bullock's stalker killed himself in a standoff with police. Miranda Cosgrove's stalker set himself on fire on her front lawn. John Lennon, Rebecca Schaeffer, and Christina Grimmie were killed by their stalkers. George Harrison and his wife were attacked by a man with a hateful obsession against the Beatles, which resulted in him being stabbed over 30 times. Jodie Foster's stalker John Hinckley Jr. was so obsessed that he attempted to assassinate the President to impress her.",
            "That is so creepy. \n\nI can't even imagine how it must feel to constantly have to face situations like this. My heart goes out to all of them, and like you said, I know some of them are rich and successful, but that doesn't negate that they must find it really hard dealing with situations like this",
            "The fact that this is still happening blows my mind.\n\nIt happens all the time to the nct and wayv members and whenever they complain about the fans behaviours, malicious rumours about them spread online and international fans spread it as gospel despite proof they are made up.\n\nBreaking into their hotel rooms, stealing their personal information, taking items from their luggage and rooms it\u2019s disgusting",
            "On a side note, Jaejoong will always have my respect for forever changing the idol career landscape by challenging SM/Avex and putting an end to the super exploitative contracts.",
            "I saw a clip of this earlier and the way he speaks so casually about it broke my heart so much cos the only way to reach that point is if something happens often and /get used to it/ for lack of a better word. Cos my jaw was on the floor about the person sending him a picture of him in his home and the one who kissed him in his sleep. I just..!\n\n![gif](giphy|Ld7IFYuds4MA8)",
            "I actually met a woman in Korea who traveled there because she was convinced she and Jaejoong had known each other in a previous life and that they needed to meet so that she could apologize and pay her karmatic debt. She was very convincing tbh. But I was shocked by some of the stuff she told me and how close she was able to get to him. It\u2019s scary for celebrities and idols. Especially when some people have like very real delusions and probably mental health issues.",
            "This was so sad to hear. Imagine complete stranger s watching your every move even inside your house. Him saying he woke up with a sasaeng kissing his face was WILD. It was especially sad to hear that he formed the habit of constantly checking his environment. I remember that Yunho incident where someone poured glue in his orange juice and he ended up hospitalized. \n\nWith the amount of trauma and paranoia sasaengs inflicted on them I'm surprised he'd still even want to be reborn as an idol (although I guess sasaengs these days are a lot less crazy now)",
            "It is sad how he was almost crucified by the netizens because he lashed out at a sasaeng even though he was dealing with this kind of situation on a daily basis. Now people are mocking him on twitter for writing a song about this, like how do they not understand this isn't a laughable situation, he has to live with this for 20 years?"
