            "I actually like Lisa's new song (Rockstar). Not enough to put it in my playlist but I appreciate the musicality. I know a lot of people complain that, just like her BP era, the song is repetitive, has poorly written lyrics, or is often empty in substance. While those facts may be true, the song itself is also just not bad in general. Despite the lacking lyrics, whoever produced the song definitely had a better vision.\n\n  \nParts that I like about it:\n\n- The audio mixing. It is loads better than what Lisa gets in YG. The way the song was edited definitely enhanced her vocals to the point that I can appreciate her vocal tone more. Yet also not to the point where you can complain that it is heavily autotuned. It's tasteful autotune, if I'm putting a phrase to it.\n\n- The rhythm and the beats. This is what people say is often repetitive or empty-sounding but I quite like the \"minimalistic\" vibe of the song. I also like how you can tell that despite going with a similar route, the \"swag\" of the song sounds way different than YG's usual composition (or Teddy's, specifically).\n\n- The overall vibe. Comparing it to her YG song (Money and Lalisa), I definitely like Rockstar a lot more. Money and Lalisa had a certain \"shoutiness\" to it (I can't quite find a word to explain it), but it's basically just a bunch of \"I am rich! I am famous!\" amplified by the grating beats that it was put over. Rockstar has a more 'chic' approach to the same sentiment like \"I'm rich and famous, and?\". Idk if that makes any sense but Rockstar just feels more like a song that someone who doesn't have anything to prove would put out, someone so comfortable in their fame that they don't need to shout it to the world.",

        "content": "[livestream](https://x.com/qtkwanpie/status/1806685175126032658) Or [a link to the full performance if this is a clearer video!](https://x.com/moeum_zip/status/1806720291995111742)\n\nSeventeen just performed at the biggest music and arts festival in the world; Glastonbury.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what Glastonbury is, it's a massive festival in the UK where people camp overnight, with tons of stages and artists from all over the world. It's a big deal; when I lived in the UK, it was a fight to get tickets every time.\n\nAnd that's the big piece; tickets sell out long before the lineup is announced.\n\nWhen I realized Seventeen would be performing here, my first feeling was honestly nerves - kpop groups often rely on their fandoms when it comes to festivals such as this. In fact, festivals will book big kpop acts TO attract huge crowds, because kpop fans know how to show up.\n\nBut for this one, there was no way for fans to get tickets; maybe, at most 500 Carats were able to find people reselling. But I have multiple friends who have been looking for tickets for months before - it's very very hard.\n\nSo the reality was that they would be playing to a (likely smaller) audience, of people who had never heard their music, on a stage at 2:45 PM on the first day of the festival. Majority of these fans would also be english speaking brits. The odds were utterly stacked against them.\n\n**But WOW oh wow, did they show up and show out.** Was it the biggest crowd they've played to? Not at all. But it didn't need to be. I want to commend Seventeen for being such strong performers above all else; they know how to engage a crowd, they know how to freakin SING, they know how to have fun with their craft.\n\nI loved when it panned to the crowd and you could see grown men in t-shirts for other artists at the festival, jumping and smiling ear-to-ear. I was moved to tears a couple of times, though I really encourage people to watch the entire set, or at the first least the last five minutes where they did the infinite Aju Nice.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of the entire show was seeing Seungkwan dancing and holding the hands of excited middle aged ladies who seemed to be having the time of their life!! And then Seungkwan's adorable interaction with a little girl. So incredible. [Here is a link!](https://x.com/moeum_zip/status/1806700042960712191)\n\nFrom [Headliner ](https://x.com/sounds_of_cheol/status/1806698419995681248)to [Cheers to Youth](https://x.com/adoraboole/status/1806697681798226335), Seventeen know how to move a crowd that knows nothing about them. As Joshua said, music is the bridge between language and culture.\n\nAnd this performance showed that Kpop doesn't need to just exist within its little bubble of super fans; it deserves to have a spotlight on a more global stage, and I really hope this performance showed people how incredible the genre can be!\n\nEdit:\n\nGoing to add some more clips of performances as I come across them on X :)\n\n[Cheers to Youth](https://x.com/gyupachups/status/1806703011894567132)\n\n[Hoshi hyping up the crowd for HOT](https://x.com/miwon17_/status/1806699001280159996)\n\n[Full Aju Nice performance,](https://x.com/joshu_jihanist/status/1806701240740462931) [Never-ending Aju Nice](https://x.com/shua_enthusiast/status/1806701151674597550) and [Seungkwan crowd interaction!](https://x.com/adoraboole/status/1806702768855601444)\n\n[KUNG CHI PAK CHI](https://x.com/minghaocheol_/status/1806718668086325408)",

They obviously know how to engage with and hype the crowd (seriously, hoshi is a mind blowing hype man his adlibs are so engaging I was so hyped in my bedroom like I was at the festival itself and seungkwan\u2019s interactions with the audience, regardless old and young were so hilarious and adorable to watch) and it\u2019s amazing to see their energy being reciprocated by the audience, seriously the best, most receptive and open-minded audience I\u2019ve seen in festivals. \n\nI love it when performers look like they\u2019re having complete fub on stage and nothing else matters and that was exactly how it felt watching their set. Given the positive reception I\u2019m seeing all over twitter right now even from non-svt fans, I hope they are invited to headline Glastonbury next year!",

I was a tiny bit worried about crowd receptiveness bc of how they were announced after tickets had sold out, but I needn\u2019t have been! I\u2019ve always felt like British and Irish gig/festival goers just  really go for it and can find something to enjoy in almost any act, and it was really great to see that play out here!",

She has really distinct features, which depending on your skill level and the medium you use can either make it really easy or difficult. I would imagine the easy thing about Seulgi is that her most distinct feature is her eyes, so you really just need to get the eyes right, but if the eyes are wrong then it all looks off.\n\nIrene on the other hand seems really hard to draw. I rarely see truly good drawings of her and she doesn\u2019t have that one distinguishing feature in the way that Seulgi does. The challenge with Irene is the symmetry of her face. She\u2019s so ridiculously symmetrical that if the placement of even one feature is wrong, the entire drawing looks off. The distinguishing feature of Irene is the harmony between her features.",
