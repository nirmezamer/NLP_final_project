            "Is there a good guide for Kain mobbing?  I don\u2019t understand the malice system. I\u2019m used to playing DW and am overwhelmed by the number of attacks that Kain has. Which attacks and buffs should I be using?",
            "Is it normal to be too weak to do content? Tera blink + EXP Tickets got me to lvl 230, but I'm struggling in Arcane River. Is the solution just to wait for my daily bosses to drop gear like boots/gloves etc since I only have the CRA gear from boxes? Cause I don't even have Pensalir gear, and am too high leveled to farm it, so I'm assuming like I'd have to wait and do Cygnus until I can get gloves/boots for example?",
            "Anyone know how many frags it\u2019s gonna take to unlock the new mastery core and Janus?",
            "Am I playing Mech wrong or is it super clunky doing MP and arcane dailies",
            "Is anybody else struggling with Epic High Mountain? My character is quite weak (10M CP) and I managed to slog through the first 9 stages (each taking like, 10m each), but I'm barely scratching the final boss. Wondering if I should try and power through or just leave it for a few weeks and come back after I'm stronger",
            "I managed to exchange coins for a Absolab warrior glove on Heroic when I needed a Pirate glove instead, does anyone have experience with Nexon support being able to reverse something like this or is it too minor? I have heard they sometimes are able to give you back items etc if you did something by accident, so I have some hopium before SSF lmao.",
            "I'm not familiar with the flame system but I noticed I have 100 Karma Black Rebirth Flames that expire tomorrow, is it worth spending them on my fake absolab weapon? Rest of my equips are just temporary. Is there some other accessory I should be using these on if not the fake weapon?",
            "Newish player here - I hyper burned a Night Walker due to the various comments and Youtube vids suggesting how good and easy it is to play - however, I am finding it being slow and clunky. I looked up various videos on how to burst effectively  and that seems OK, but mobbing feels really, really bad compared to my main, Dawn Warrior. I know I am supposed to get a cooldown helmet for bite, but is there something else I am missing that might be obvious? I am lv 236 currently.",
            "For SSF:\n\nHow do you tap superior gollux to 21? Push fodders to 22 and transfer, or 21 then tap 20 -> 21?\n\nIs it a good idea to try for 22 for CRA (I am at 21) or tap my other gear first past 17?",
            "Hey guys I just hyperburned a bishop and hit 203 on it and was looking to try another class to main so was looking to delete it to reburn another one. I should be able to get all the boxes and everything again on the new character right? I did accept the first 200 set of burning rewards already but that should be a small thing in the grand scheme of things yes? Was looking to switch to dawn warrior myself."
