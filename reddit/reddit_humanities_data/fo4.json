            "For a game that came out in 2015 it definitely isn't bad.  \n\nIt's looking a bit outdated graphically sometimes but holds up nicely.",
            "Art direction can go a long way. The only thing I downloaded was a lite grass mod to add a tiny bit of green and wow, such a small mod went a very long way.",
            "Yeah, a really pleasant game to look at for sure, especially with the god rays. Good art direction too!",
            "Held up better than Skyrim",
            "The materials work and natural lighting is on point. It is just the animations and LOD management that\u2019s hurts it. I had a mod that put everything to ultra, and I never notice pop in until now, because of the dumb update I can\u2019t access my mod menu anymore to re-enable it. And I got to tell you, I didn\u2019t realise how diabolical the render distance was.",

Like after 10 missions doing the Lord's work for the BOS, maybe he starts to lighten up some. Then once I take Bunker Hill with them he's even cooler, might even like me some. Then when.

Junk jet, drug him with the syringes, flame on, baseball launcher. Go for the legs, five grenades. The fun never ends. Get a new weapon? Fast travel quick save try it on Rhys.",
