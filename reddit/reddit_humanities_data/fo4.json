            "Definitely had fun with this, especially since I passed most of the intelligence checks and didnt have to go hoofing around the Commonwealth for random parts. After they crash landed, I used my robotics perk to shut down all the bots inside the ship and I ransacked the whole thing.",
            "I just discovered this quest myself a few days ago and it is easily my favorite side quest. It's just so absurd and yet interesting, and the final payoff (assuming you side with the bots) is just *chef's kiss*.",
            "Once they shoot off and get stuck again, is there any way to get back on the ship and see the robots again?",
            "I had to do that fucking quest like 5 times because I kept either using explosives and friendly firing or just shooting the fucking handys attacking the scavengers because they kept going right in front of my firing line. \n\nQuest is awesome though, I still have to visit the ship after they take off. If thats possible I dont even know"
