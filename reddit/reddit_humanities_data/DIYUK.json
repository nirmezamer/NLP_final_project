        "content": "Welcome to the Asbestos Megathread! Here we will try to answer all your questions related to asbestos. Please include images if possible and be aware that most answers will probably be: \u201cbuy a test kit and get it tested\u201d. \n\nDIY test kits: [Here](https://www.asbestos-sampling.com/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwo7iiBhAEEiwAsIxQEd1GvmohrcvM1uw0l2Ty-gF7ygjV6QoqidyJO3_91fHaziWEsUr1zRoC-8YQAvD_BwE)\n\n**HSE Asbestos information**\n\nHealth and Safety Executive information on asbestos: [Here](https://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/)\n\n**What is asbestos?**\n\nAsbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was commonly used in construction materials. It is made up of tiny fibers that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Asbestos was used until the late 1990s in the UK, when it was finally banned. Asbestos may be found in any building constructed before circa 2000. \n\n**What are some common products that contain asbestos?**\n\nAsbestos was commonly used in a variety of construction materials, including insulation, roofing materials, and flooring tiles. It was also used in automotive brake pads and other industrial products.\n\n**How can I tell if a product contains asbestos?**\n\nIt is impossible to tell whether a product contains asbestos just by looking at it (unless it has been tested and has a warning sign). If you suspect that a product may contain asbestos, it is best to have it tested by a professional.\n\n**How can I prevent asbestos exposure?**\n\nThe best way to prevent asbestos exposure is to avoid materials that contain asbestos. If you are working with materials that may contain asbestos, be sure to wear protective clothing and a respirator.\n\n**What should I do if I find asbestos in my home?**\n\nIf you find asbestos in your home, it is best to leave it alone and have it assessed by a professional. The best course of action may be to leave it undisturbed. Do not attempt to remove asbestos yourself, as this can release dangerous fibres in to the air.\n\nThe most significant risks to homeowners is asbestos insulation. This should never be tackled by a DIYer and needs specialist removal and cleaning. Fortunately it is rarely found in a domestic setting.",

            "My father was involved with writing the HSE asbestos guidance, I can ask him technical questions if needed, but a few words of advice I have learned over the years:\n\nIf anyone here is afraid of asbestos or worried about an exposure they may have had, it\u2019s very hard to get reassurance and  level-headed advice. Safety guidance is often scary on purpose to make you pay attention, so in an attempt to balance the discussion and reassure people: asbestos risks can be overblown sometimes by companies wanting you to pay them to remove it, and you should not always panic. If the fibres are sitting quietly in a wall cavity or aren\u2019t being disturbed, you are not necessarily being exposed.\n\nIn general, asbestos is like radiation: The exposure matters. In other words \u201chow big a dose was there *and for how long*\u201d.\nNow, that latter part matters because as DIYers the time that we are exposed to asbestos is very short compared to a person who handles asbestos for their job. The guidance and exposure limits are *occupational*, meaning they are not really written for us.\n\nHaving said that, if you think you have had an exposure, the anxiety and stress can last for years and cause more harm than the asbestos. It\u2019s statistically difficult to say whether a single exposure to asbestos can actually cause cancer (because of how cancer works) but it is really quite unlikely. \n\nThe other little fact I have is that white asbestos does actually break down in the body (albeit very slowly) I think it has a half life of about 5 years, so your exposure can go down over time.",

            "Story time: I recently had a leak which caused a hole in the ceiling. Insurance company clocked it's an 80s house with textured ceiling so requested asbestos test be done. Large professional asbestos specialist came out, made even more holes in ceiling. Said in his opinion it was very unlikely to come back positive. Guess what? Positive. Moral of the story is if a professional asbestos tester can't tell by eye then Reddit probably can't and just get it bloody tested.\n\n(Now waiting for insurance claim to be resolved, as the whole ceiling will need professional removal before its replaced - for anyone interested in the resolution. It will be an utter ball ache)",
            "I had suspected asbestos and got someone out to test it. Felt like a waste of money when the result came back negative. But I suppose the peace of mind was worth it though because it was my daughter's room.",
            "Are we doing FAQs in here? If so woodchip wallpaper isn't asbestos, it's wooden chips. Marley tiles do contain traces of asbestos but it's deep inside the thermoplastic so it's fine to lift and replace them, just don't be sanding them. It's mainly old corrugated roofing and insulation that are the bigger risks.\n\nMaybe a lighting circuit megathread next?",
            "Is it even worth testing my 30-40yr old garage's corrugated roof sheets? If it looks like asbestos, quacks like asbestos, is there anything else it could realistically even be?",
            "This is more advice on the decision making process to adopt with asbestos than specific information but I think the When and Why are just as important as then What and How when dealing with risk management topics. A key takeaway I'll share from my own asbestos training is that a considerable amount of deaths from mesothelioma have been caused by a failure to properly estimate the likelihood of asbestos being disturbed in the future and a lack of active risk management.\n\nApologies for the awkward sourcing I've used below but I think it's more appropriate to give search terms than direct links to document downloads.\n\nA good example is the history of asbestos related deaths of teachers in the UK. Between 2001 and 2016 there were 305 such deaths according to ONS census data (ONS ref 009791) and evidence suggests that the UK teachers have a 5x higher mesothelioma death rate (\"Mesothelioma deaths in teachers and nurses in Great Britain\", gov.uk has a pdf link on Google). \n\nThese teachers haven't been sawing into pipework lagging or smashing up cladding and the asbestos present in the walls of their classrooms is largely white asbestos which (at the time) they were told was safe (interview with Elizabeth Bradford, UCU yt). The reason for these deaths is instead something nobody prepared for, simply spending significant amounts of time in an environment with asbestos as it steadily degrades and occasionally pushing thumb tacks into the walls to hang up children's artwork. \n\nWhat we have here are victims of a hazard and a chain of events that simply wasn't expected by the decision makers who could have prevented it and the reason why when asbestos is impractical to remove, active steps to mange it are required because you cannot just leave it and hope nothing happens to it. \n\nFor any DIYers reading, this means that if for some reason you cannot remove asbestos, you should still ensure it is properly recorded, inspected, and labelled with others in your household clearly educated not to disturb it.\n\nOf these, education and training is worth highlighting as children in particular are agents of unpredictable blind chaos. It is not enough to simply hope someone will understand the label on your ceiling tiles means they shouldn't see if they can get pencils to stick in them, you must explain it tomthem in terms they understand.\n\nTldr, if you're not removing asbestos, keep checking it and take steps to prevent it being disturbed by others ignorant of the danger.",
            "Just going to point out that \"don't attempt to remove asbestos yourself\" is a grossly blanket statement.\n\nFor certain things I agree, but of example corrugated roof sheets that are screwed down are pretty safe for someone to remove if they are not damaged in the process. Additionally anything with tightly bonded asbestos is often safe to remove with care.",
            "Could I make some comments? It is impossible to tell whether a material contains asbestos (unless it has already been tested and has a warning sign), not just difficult. \n\nThe most significant risks to homeowners would be asbestos insulation. This should never be tackled by a DIYer and needs specialist removal and cleaning. Fortunately it is rare in a domestic setting. \n\nIt may be better in some circumstances to leave the asbestos in place, or to contain it, rather than than remove it. This should be done on the basis of professional advice.\n\nThere is a difference between licenced and non-licenced. It could be appropriate for a DIYer to remove, say, a small number of asbestos roof sheets. It is non-licenced both because of quantity and type (white asbestos bound in a cement product).\n\nAppreciate this is only supposed to be the intro but links to the HSE website which has more detail on specific risks and example work.",
            "I just bought my first house, homebuyer survey told me there was \"probably\" asbestos in the textured ceiling but nowhere else. Several tradesmen told me adamantly that I definitely had asbestos all over the house including in the woodchip wallpaper?! Which obviously led to weeks of sleepless nights for me after having scraped and removed said wallpaper. Test came back negative for the ceiling (and walls), but the surveyor had completely failed to identify the entire loft full of broken bits of asbestos roofing that the previous owners had just left scattered everywhere, and the entire kitchen dining room floor (asbestos tiles). It's a \u00a33000 bill to remove it all. Lesson learned - don't trust anyone when it comes to asbestos, and just get it tested."

            "Agreed with what's proposed here. I think it strikes a good balance. \nPeople naturally ask those asbestos/ decent work/ quote/ crack questions here because they while they're not DIY questions a bit of DIY knowledge goes a long way to formulating a good answer.\n\nSome of the people reading this sub will have that knowledge and be keen to share it. Anyone else can choose to filter based on flair \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIt would be cool to have a wiki with community sourced and voted on advice, particularly for asbestos, advice around getting quotes, what to do if you think work hasn't been carried out to standard etc. It's a bit of a commitment to organise but would allow us to do away with the asbestos megathread and the repeated asbestos asks that are always answered in the same way (don't disturb it, buy a test kit, employ a reputable company to remove it from the property, talk to the council if you need to dispose of it)",
