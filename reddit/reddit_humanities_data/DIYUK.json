        "content": "Welcome to the Asbestos Megathread! Here we will try to answer all your questions related to asbestos. Please include images if possible and be aware that most answers will probably be: \u201cbuy a test kit and get it tested\u201d. \n\nDIY test kits: [Here](https://www.asbestos-sampling.com/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwo7iiBhAEEiwAsIxQEd1GvmohrcvM1uw0l2Ty-gF7ygjV6QoqidyJO3_91fHaziWEsUr1zRoC-8YQAvD_BwE)\n\n**HSE Asbestos information**\n\nHealth and Safety Executive information on asbestos: [Here](https://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/)\n\n**What is asbestos?**\n\nAsbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was commonly used in construction materials. It is made up of tiny fibers that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Asbestos was used until the late 1990s in the UK, when it was finally banned. Asbestos may be found in any building constructed before circa 2000. \n\n**What are some common products that contain asbestos?**\n\nAsbestos was commonly used in a variety of construction materials, including insulation, roofing materials, and flooring tiles. It was also used in automotive brake pads and other industrial products.\n\n**How can I tell if a product contains asbestos?**\n\nIt is impossible to tell whether a product contains asbestos just by looking at it (unless it has been tested and has a warning sign). If you suspect that a product may contain asbestos, it is best to have it tested by a professional.\n\n**How can I prevent asbestos exposure?**\n\nThe best way to prevent asbestos exposure is to avoid materials that contain asbestos. If you are working with materials that may contain asbestos, be sure to wear protective clothing and a respirator.\n\n**What should I do if I find asbestos in my home?**\n\nIf you find asbestos in your home, it is best to leave it alone and have it assessed by a professional. The best course of action may be to leave it undisturbed. Do not attempt to remove asbestos yourself, as this can release dangerous fibres in to the air.\n\nThe most significant risks to homeowners is asbestos insulation. This should never be tackled by a DIYer and needs specialist removal and cleaning. Fortunately it is rarely found in a domestic setting.",

            "Story time: I recently had a leak which caused a hole in the ceiling. Insurance company clocked it's an 80s house with textured ceiling so requested asbestos test be done. Large professional asbestos specialist came out, made even more holes in ceiling. Said in his opinion it was very unlikely to come back positive. Guess what? Positive. Moral of the story is if a professional asbestos tester can't tell by eye then Reddit probably can't and just get it bloody tested.\n\n(Now waiting for insurance claim to be resolved, as the whole ceiling will need professional removal before its replaced - for anyone interested in the resolution. It will be an utter ball ache)",
            "I had suspected asbestos and got someone out to test it. Felt like a waste of money when the result came back negative. But I suppose the peace of mind was worth it though because it was my daughter's room.",
            "Are we doing FAQs in here? If so woodchip wallpaper isn't asbestos, it's wooden chips. Marley tiles do contain traces of asbestos but it's deep inside the thermoplastic so it's fine to lift and replace them, just don't be sanding them. It's mainly old corrugated roofing and insulation that are the bigger risks.\n\nMaybe a lighting circuit megathread next?",
            "Is it even worth testing my 30-40yr old garage's corrugated roof sheets? If it looks like asbestos, quacks like asbestos, is there anything else it could realistically even be?",
            "Just going to point out that \"don't attempt to remove asbestos yourself\" is a grossly blanket statement.\n\nFor certain things I agree, but of example corrugated roof sheets that are screwed down are pretty safe for someone to remove if they are not damaged in the process. Additionally anything with tightly bonded asbestos is often safe to remove with care.",
            "There is a sub Reddit for this by the way",
            "Lots of green dust under old carpet of trodden down old underlay, fitted approx mid 90s, is this a possible concern?",
            "We currently have Marley tiles in our flat that are exposed but mainly covered with rugs. Some are broken round the edge of the room but have vacuumed thoroughly and they are no longer disturbed. We are planning to get carpet soon but my partner who has asthma has trouble breathing at night sometimes and is very worried she may be being consistently exposed to asbestos. \n\nThe tiles don\u2019t appear to be frangible or have any way of releasing their fibres but would like some advice from anyone in the know.",
            "I have artex ceilings in various rooms throughout my house, which I am aware could contain asbestos. But up until now, it's never been an issue.\n\nRecently, I've noticed cracks in those artex ceilings that weren't there before. Could those cracks disturb the asbestos (if there is any)?",
            "I'm buying an old house built in 1880 but has had renovation work done to it throughout it's life. The estate agent had an asbestos company out and apparently the result was negative. Does anyone have any idea how extensive this survey would have been or would it likely be a call out for a specific concern in the house? The sale hasn't gone through yet so no access to this survey."

I have added a \u201cnon-DIY advice\u201d flair which is for anything housing/building related but not necessarily work being carried out by OP themselves. Again, please report incorrectly flaired posts. \n\nI have added a rule to use the correct flair on posts. If you see posts without flairs, especially \u201cquote\u201d posts then please report them and I can either remove the posts or assign the correct flair myself.  There\u2019s no need for \u201cwrong sub\u201d or \u201cnot DIY\u201d comments cluttering the discussion. Use the report button. \n\nI\u2019m considering removing the asbestos megathread and using this flair method with asbestos related posts too. Allowing people to filter them out entirely. Megathreads never get answered anyway. \n\nI\u2019m open to all thoughts and ideas so please post here with any ideas related to the sub!\n\nPS. Images in comments are now allowed.

That ceiling is too low in the rest of the room, only in a small corner is it the perfect height so to that commenter: thank you, you are a genius and I am so grateful!\n\nWith some very tight wiggling and manoeuvring, plus removing one foot (it only has two, luckily one was on the side we needed) and slightly scraping the floor and ceiling, we managed to get the fridge to its intended place! \ud83e\udd73 \n\nNo holes were made, the arch is safe I promise, and now we\u2019ve understood the technique and the exact path it needs to go through, it\u2019ll be a lot easier to remove if/when needed.
