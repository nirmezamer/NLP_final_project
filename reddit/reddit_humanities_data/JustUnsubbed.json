The mods solution was to go to the sub to search for and then exclude those posts marked as DEAD PETS. \n\nI stayed for a minute because hey, cats are cute and i joined the sub to look at cute endorphin inducing pictures of kitties, NOT DEAD PETS. but even though I don't engage in those DEAD PET posts that's all i really saw from that *huge* community. \n\nLast straw happened and I declared my displeasure of the lack of a safe place for these folks to *actually genuinely mourn* instead of using their boohoo situation to farm karma.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JustUnsubbed/comments/1drcgiz/just_unsubbed_from_atheism/",
        "content": "I\u2019m sure most already know of their reputation for just shitting on religion and religious people, but there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. They also shit on fellow atheists if they aren\u2019t being hostile and aggressive enough.\n\nAs a former active member please allow me to give a little insight into what\u2019s going on. That sub has a huge amount of people in what we call the \u201cangry atheist phase.\u201d Simply put its when you stop believing in your religion and you feel you\u2019ve been lied to your entire life. You feel angry you devoted time and money to an organization you now see as false or wrong. So atheism isn\u2019t just a sub for atheists, it\u2019s also a safe space for \u201cangry atheists\u201d to vent and get their frustrations out without being judged. The problem is you can\u2019t have all those people filled with anger mixed with calmer people more interested in philosophical debate, or in delving deep into religion and carefully deconstructing everything about it you see as wrong or a contradiction. We\u2019re all on the same side in that sub yet it\u2019s a war zone. Make a post talking about a contradiction in religion \u201cxyz\u201d and the vast majority of responses will be along the lines of, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to say about it. We\u2019re right, they\u2019re wrong, and they\u2019re all dumb sheep.\u201d It\u2019s like everyone there forgot that many of us *were* religious once and the entire reason we\u2019re not is thanks to the kinds of deep dives that always get downvoted and responded to with venom.\n\nI flair this as sad because I did have a lot of nice and wholesome moments there. I made a post about still celebrating Christmas since it\u2019s so big in America and an overall really lovely holiday. I just do it secularly without the religious aspects and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was weird of me to do so. I got a bunch of responses from people who did the same which was really nice to hear. Of course I had just as many \u201care you crazy? What do you think Christian\u2019s own the holiday and we can\u2019t celebrate it too?\u201d Style comments. \n\nI joined that sub because I was the only atheist I knew and it was super nice to be able to connect with others, but I\u2019m just so tired of being attacked for saying \u201creligion is wrong for this reason\u201d rather than just \u201creligion is wrong.\u201d I even found myself using their super hostile rhetoric in a lot of my posts and comments because it was the only way I knew I\u2019d get a positive interaction. *My* angry atheist phase ended when I was a teenager. I\u2019m fine with allowing others the safe space to vent, but I shouldn\u2019t have to regress to let them do that. Hence why I\u2019m leaving. The excatholic sub is smaller, but a bit more my speed from what I\u2019ve seen. Maybe if atheism adds flairs for specific posts like for venting frustrations or being a bit philosophical it could help, but until then I just can\u2019t deal with being hated by people for expressing their exact same views and opinions - just in a less toxic way.",
