        "content": "The summer heat has hit Homebase, commanders, and it's time we re-enter the Blasted Badlands for a new Venture season!\u00a0\n\n\n\n# Return To The Badlands\n\nThe Rage modifier is back! Blast through the badlands by dealing damage to **fill your Rage meter**, shortening ability cooldowns and increasing ability damage. But be careful, your stamina won\u2019t refill on its own without eliminating husks! Complete Venture Challenge Quests to raise your Venture Level and unlock rewards including Jackpot Llamas, Vouchers, and Supercharger and Flux resources to boost your Homebase\u2019s power.\n\nAlso returning this Venture are the **Hit The Road** mode and **Imposter** questline!\u00a0\n\nIn **Hit The Road**, help the heroes of Homebase groove to their song of the summer in Hit The Road by escorting them across the badlands. Escort characters with unique modifiers and keep the van vibes rollin\u2019. You'll escort two Heroes in Hit The Road \u2014 Quinn and Crackshot \u2014 each on a journey to broadcast their Songs of the Summer. Quinn's modifier \"Shields Up!\" will boost your shield's regeneration, while Crackshot's \"Concussive Shieldbreak\" modifier will knock enemies back when your shield runs out. Hitch a ride and help broadcast Quinn and Crackshot's Songs of the Summer!\n\nIn the **Impostor** Questline, support everyone\u2019s favorite burger boss-turned-Hero, Dennis, journey from survivor to warrior in Imposter. With his unique Burger Buff perk, your eliminations turn into tasty burgers for Health and Energy regen. Yum!\u00a0\n\n\n\n# A New Hero Sprints Onto The Scene\n\n**Eternal Wanderer** has arrived in the Event Store, a new speedy space scout with stamina out of the stratosphere! Sprint to make foes vulnerable and finish them off with a shot, while leaving dramatic clouds for your friends to see with this new STW hero!\n\n* Support Perk: **Eat My Space Dust**\n   * Sprint stamina is doubled.\n* Commander Perk: **Eat My Space Dust +**\u00a0\n   * Sprint Stamina is doubled. While sprinting, leave a cloud of space dust that deals damage per second behind you. Additionally, enemies caught in the cloud have increased damage vulnerability while they are affected.\n\n\n\n# Build Into Terrain\n\nAlso in the Save The World v30.10 game update, you can now build into the environment terrain! Similar to the way building functions in other experiences in Fortnite you can now build structures that would partially poke into the environment, such as at the side of a rocky slope, into the roof of a cave, and more!",

            "New hero is fun. It\u2019s like beehive husks but you\u2019re the beehive husk. And the added extra sprint works great with the baron",

            "Thanks for the post, u/EmptyTux, and it looks like some fun changes. Is there a reason why this is no longer posted on EpicGames official site anymore? Sorry if that's been answered already.",
            "Kinda sad the new hero doesn't have voice lines but her perk actually seems pretty decent and the VFX looks really cool (support perk will be great for farming builds too)",
            "Anyone else noticing that their lobbies are defaulting to \"No Fill\", so you'll get empty lobbies until you change the setting?",
            "The new hero already seems quite fun, and useful for farming builds!",
            "Will this report be on the Fortnite news website too? If not then... uh oh.",
            "awwwww yeeeeeeeeeee",
            "PSA idk if it\u2019s intended but southie with blast from the past completely negates the modifier of this venture. Great for farming! I\u2019m using him with clip in support for that 33% x2 drops on AMC.\u00a0",

I still use the banner and feel happy about actually unlocking it.\n\nIt\u2019s only worth if you still play the mode on a daily basis or grind stuff like Ventures, any small amount of play goes a long way at unlocking these",
