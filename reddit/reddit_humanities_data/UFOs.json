        "content": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m Yuan Fung, Founding Executive Director of the UAP Disclosure Fund. I have over 20 years of experience working in campaign politics as a consultant and creative director. I founded this new nonprofit group in order to help build a grassroots political movement to fight for UAP transparency and raise public awareness of the issue. We have assembled an incredible team and are excited about the work we will accomplish with your support!\n\nI\u2019m Matt Ford, Director of Strategy for the UAP Disclosure Fund. I am also the creator & host of \u2018The Good Trouble Show with Matt Ford\u2019 where I cover UAP issues and interview thought leaders on the topic.\n\nOur kickoff campaign is a petition in support of including UAP legislation to the forthcoming 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. It\u2019s critical that we make our voices heard. Please visit [UAPdisclosurefund.org](http://uapdisclosurefund.org/) and sign the petition!\n\n[https://x.com/UAPDF/status/1804582785191154169](https://x.com/UAPDF/status/1804582785191154169)\n\nIt was great answering so many excellent questions from the community.

            "The mods have pulled some questions from users who were unable to attend the AMA; the following was asked by /u/Best-Comparison-7598:\n\n**If what Grusch has said is true, and If multiple, high level whistleblowers have already provided evidence to congressional staff, who are now well aware of things behind the scenes that the public is not privy to, how realistic can public pressure be at this point? If the UAPDA can be blocked by just a handful of people, presumably under the influence of the gatekeepers, what inside deals can be made to persuade them to disclose? Every strategy thus far essentially boils down to pleading with them. What can organizations like yours offer the gatekeepers that would be enticing for them to give up their secrets?**",
            "Do you think that part of the disclosure offered by a fully passed UAPDA 2.0 will include thorough explanation of what parts of the UFO phenomenon and associated government secrecy are rooted psychic phenomena/consciousness, and which are rooted in the study of physical craft and technology? Also how these two things are related?",
            "It has been reported that UAP are viewed as more sensitive than nuclear weapons in the US, Government, also Grusch stated this is an arms race, if these statements are true, why should we expect Disclosure ?",
            "Lobby groups in the US unfortunately rely on rich people to be effective. Have you received any interest from the billionaire class? Do you have a specific strategy to get the entire UAPDA passed in the 2025 NDAA?",
            "Do you think disclosure is going to drive mankind towards greater spirituality, or towards more agnosticism and even atheism? Will the major faiths survive it in their traditional forms? Will atheism? What is going to be done to facilitate this by the fund?",
            "Best case scenario, all the UAP legislation we want passes. \n\nWhat kind of proof will the public get to see? Proof of aliens or NHI here on earth.",
            "Lets say this new legislation doesnt pass again for the 3rd time (pretty much)  what does the next year/years look like for disclosure? Where are the 40 plus interviewees that have spoken to the inspector general? Where is Gruschs Op Ed piece it was to be released first week of February  its nearly July a full year since his interview, nearly a full year since the hearing  \nSurely safety comes in numbers, nothing would do more for disclosure than 10-20 hell all 40 whistleblowers coming forward at once, sit down in front of Ross Coulthart and the world cameras and say their evidence otherwise were left with Wait for my new book coming soon! More whistleblowers coming soon!",
            "What, if any, are the questions you think you or the government are hoping that we dont ask, and why? (A while back I believe Elizondo suggested that we will never hear them use the word hybrid, etc., and Leslie Keane made it clear that they had plenty of reasons to include the subject of abductions in their famous New York Times story, but decided not to because they were afraid it would seriously damage the rest of the articles credibility).",
            "James Lacatski stated that some of the documents David Grusch reviewed were probaby counterfeit because he has seen counterfeit documents, comments ?",
            "The mods have pulled some questions from users who were unable to attend the AMA; the following was asked by /u/FortyOneandDone:\n\n**I donate $2k a year, what exactly would my money go towards if I made that donation to you?**"

            "I think a lot of the frustration with moderation is less about how strict the rules are and more about how wildly inconsitently they're interpreted",
            "If a ufologist or scientist is talking about an arguably off topic subject like cattle mutilations, crop circles, or the nature of reality consciousness then I think it needs to be allowed because its part of ufology and can help us understand ufos. (Which is what I view as the point of the subreddit) Mods **Removing** peer reviewed science or skeptical science on related topics just makes people here less informed and hurts the field and the sub",
            "I've been in forums forever and don't have many criticisms of how r/UFOs is moderated. It's a difficult task and the mods generally walk the fine line very well. It took balls to remove that good trouble guy's posts recently so it's not all one sided. I've given positive ratings in the survey and have no objection to gifs in comments and additional flairs. Change isn't always a bad thing. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't miss the daily New Paradigm commercials or promo posts for Danny Sheehan. NPI and Ubiquity are arguably taking money from disadvantaged people in return for nothing of value. Is it ethical to subsidise them through free marketing? That being said, there are wider implications, and a can of worms, if they were banned or openly restricted.",
            "No mention of people posting images without any meaningful description to start a meaningful discussion just to stir content in the subreddit.\n\nIMO: Images must have as much information as possible about where it was source and what the image claims to be.
