        "content": "Hello Everyone!\n\nr/UFOs will be hosting an AMA with Yuan Fung and Matt Ford from the UAP Disclosure Fund, on **Saturday June 22 at 1:00pm PST** ([Click here for your local timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=r%2FUFOs+-+AMA+with+the+UAP+Disclosure+Fund&iso=20240622T13&p1=137))\n\n[The UAP Disclosure Fund](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/) is a nonpartisan political nonprofit 501(c)(4) that advocates for greater government transparency regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). They work to support new UAP legislation, provide legal representation for whistleblowers, promote scientific research and raise public awareness in an effort to better address the UAP issue.\n\nTheir team includes:\n\n- Luis Elizondo (Board of Directors)\n- Garry Nolan (Board of Directors)\n- Karl E. Nell (Board of Directors)\n- Christopher K. Mellon (Advisory Board)\n- Kirk McConnell (Advisory Board)\n- Yuan Fung (Executive Director)\n- Matthew Ford (Director of Strategy)\n- Lesley Duckworth (Chief Financial Officer)\n\nThe UAP Disclosure Fund is [currently petitioning](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/#petition) for UAP legislation to be included in the 2025 NDAA.  Now is the time to let the U.S. Senators who cosponsored the UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 know that you support including a new version of the UAP amendment in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)!  You can sign the petition [here](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/#petition) to let lawmakers know that UAP transparency and legislation is important to you.\n\nYuan Fung has worked for over 20 years as a creative director and consultant for campaign politics and issue advocacy. He has worked on behalf of congressional, gubernatorial, senate and presidential campaigns.  Highlights include the late Senator Harry Reid, and both of Obama's presidential campaigns.  He has also done work for causes like consumer safety, the environment and clean energy.  Leveraging his political expertise and talent, he is now the executive director for the UAP Disclosure Fund.\n\nMatt Ford is an Emmy-winning political consultant, media personality, and producer based in Los Angeles. He is a trusted advisor to leading congressional representatives and their staffers on the UAP issue.  Matt has spearheaded numerous successful projects as a producer, including creating over 100 political ads for social media platforms which have been viewed by millions.  His production prowess extends to hosting The Good Trouble Show, where he engages in thought-provoking discussions with influential figures such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and other prominent political figures.  He is now the Director of Strategy for the UAP Disclosure Fund.\n\n---\n\nWe're thrilled to have Yuan and Matt participate in this AMA with the community, and we know that everyone is sure to have lots of questions! If you're unable to attend, but would still like to ask questions, feel free to share them below and we'll do our best to facilitate them on your behalf.\n\nIf you have any feedback or thoughts on other guests you'd like to see, message us directly here or let us know in the comments below.",

            "Just a friendly reminder to everyone that during the AMA, the mod team will be actively removing any questions that are inflammatory, overly accusatory or otherwise uncivil (no different than any other AMA that we have conducted in the past). With that being said, we absolutely want to be permissive in letting the community ask whatever questions they might have - even if they are hard questions. We just want to ensure that the questions are asked respectfully and with kindness towards guests that have given their time to engage with the community.\n\nAlso, please post your questions as top-level comments, not as replies to this sticky. We will not collect any questions that are posted as replies to this stickied comment. Thank you!",
            "**QUESTION**\n\nIf what Grusch has said is true, and If multiple, high level whistleblowers have already provided evidence to congressional staff, who are now well aware of things behind the scenes that the public is not privy to, how realistic can \u201cpublic pressure\u201d  be at this point? If the UAPDA can be blocked by just a handful of people, presumably under the influence of the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d, what inside deals can be made to persuade them to disclose? Every strategy thus far essentially boils down to pleading with them. What can organizations like yours offer the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d that would be enticing for them to give up their secrets?",
            "Shout out to y'all, I think the mods do a great job (for free!) to keep the sub moving. Thanks for doing the work so we can have interesting conversations.",
            "Guys, I probably won't be available when this happens, so someone please press Matt Ford on his \"OGA are conducting retrievals\" story. While I believe there are crash retrievals, I don't see how or why he and the guy at Liberation Times would be privy to this information. \n\nThey drop this bombshell, we talk about it for a week, then it just goes away and nobody questions him on his sources and nobody presses for more info. Everyone talks about Coulthart and mocks his continual \"I can't divulge my sources\" spiel, but this was one of the biggest things ever dropped in this community and nobody even questions it.",

Is there any actionable information collected by the UAPDF \u2013no need to share in this moment, I\u2019m patient\u2013 that makes the board of UAPDF think that this push will return different results?\n\nAdditionally, due to the lack of progress over the previous 50-60yrs, many who bear an interest in this topic have become jaded by public disclosure efforts such as yours. Are there any avenues of disclosure an individual could pursue (that don\u2019t involve donating money or disclosing my identity) that might result in more salient, personal disclosure? I.e. is the UAPDF aware of any practices or protocols that could result in contact experiences and/or increase an individual\u2019s metaphysical understanding of the phenomena? Or is the UAPDF aware of any widely/freely available resources that could shed light on these mysteries?",
