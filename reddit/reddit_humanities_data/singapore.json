The activist is just complaining for the sake of complaining.\nWhy would the cigarette be wrong? Yes it goes against govt no smoking stance.

Problems in Singapore are definitely more first world problems than in other places.\n\nBut uprooting my whole family somewhere else so we can experience insecurity and uncertainty? That's a little extreme. There must surely be a better way to ensure your kids grow up well adjusted.",
            "As a PR from India in SG for ~ 20 years.   \n  \n  \n\u2014/ the India side /\u2014-   \n  \nIndia isn\u2019t that much harder than Singapore. There are lots of opportunities there, with both Europe and americas looking to offshore in India (and) companies looking to derisk manufacturing concentration risk by building supply chain capability in India / SE Asia.   \n  \nLocal domestic GDP is growing higher than global average (without going into political pontification of the number being accurate). While jobs pay less, life is harder (actually just poorer, not harder per se). For kids coming out of college, there is intense competition and few slots so arguably the best survive.  \n  \nThe thing about India that builds resiliency isn\u2019t the poor / harder life, but the unpredictability. Bus not showing up on time. Power cuts when assignments are due (no internet, even if you have an inverter or generator). People not being trustworthy / honest. The system being corrupt and slow, you can rely on institutions to make things fair. Plans will need to be changed on the fly, and you\u2019ll need to be able to make decisions in a chaotic environment and make peace with failures where your decision doskt pan out.  \n  \n\u2014-  sg story \u2014-   \n  \nTalking about SG, things are very predictable. Where grievances exist, redressal is swift and for the most part empathetic and fair.   \n  \nThe hard part in Singapore is keeping up with inflation and getting priced out by affluent immigrants or younger generations. I don\u2019t think the OP has experienced this side of things, given his demographic and age group.   \n  \nSingaporeans aren\u2019t soft. I\u2019ve met cabbies who told me stories of first gen Phillips manufacturing that moved to second gen silicon chip manufacturing to precision engineering and later services economy. People have reinvented themselves to keep up, and that not easy.   \n  \nThe kids here are awesome, so let\u2019s hope our future is bright and doesn\u2019t need to second guess how we stack up against other kids from other countries.  \n  \nI can see the MOE trying to make the learning / education a bit content agnostic and inculcate a learning / growth mindset to keep them from becoming stuck over the years, and even hdb making riskier playgrounds to prevent kids from becoming risk averse. We learn and we adapt, and we\u2019re fine so long as we don\u2019t think we have nothing more to learn.    \n  \n\u2014\u2014 so how?   \n  \nI respect the OPs sentiments and maybe interpret it as a case of, \u201che\u2019s trying to give his kids more exposure\u201d.   \n  \nBut rest assured that he\u2019s not taking a dig at SG - just wondering if his kids can adapt to global conditions if they aren\u2019t citizens and have the support of the local system.",
            "Am currently in Perth for work and have discovered Singapore is kind of living in a bubble. We're insulated from a lot of global issues. A lot of what we take for granted, like the low crime rate, safety and lack of drugs are just things people get used to over here. Not to mention rampant cults, crazy people, homeless... lots of things really.\n\n\nOn the flip side, it is really odd how easy it is to get used to it. I have been here about a year and frankly the difference in crime rates and safety are just things you learn some common sense about and avoid. I walk past Falun Gong and Jehovah's Witnesses recruiters and homeless every day. And I haven't encountered drug abusers since I stopped taking public transport.\n\n\nThe beaches and weather are fantastic though. Living overseas for awhile is definitely a good experience, would recommend.",
            "My main concern here is that he's making them face problems that aren't meaningful. I'd rather have children have problems in their exams, or problems in playing school sports.\n\nThe 'soft' bubble in Singapore is there so that you can solve more meaningful issues in your life. Upgrade yourself .etc without worrying too much about decaying material conditions.",
            "Man ive missed sg. Back for a couple of days. Definitely one of the better places to live.\nI know we generally hate on sg here, but goddamn its so fking good. \nMaybe just the fact that its a bit cooler today, man i havent been in such a good mood since i was here previously.",
            "This isn\u2019t so crazy. \n\nIt\u2019s why for example in Europe parents choose to send their kids to local schools rather than private education, as it gives them some grit.\n\nSingapore is a bubble and many kids who know nothing else would struggle in another major city like London and NYC, as you need some street smarts which you just won\u2019t develop in SG as it\u2019s so safe. The amount of mental shit I\u2019ve encountered in London vs SG is beyond belief.",
            "Ironically ppl are coming here for the same reasons leh",
            "to be honest I really hate parents who do this to their kids. If the kid has already spent many of their formative years here, suddenly uprooting them will be a culture shock, and not to mention having to start from zero when it comes to mixing their peers and making friends and even just the comfort that comes with familiar places (read: NOT just comfortable living standards). It's not good to pass this kind of move off as some kind of larger life lesson.\n\nthis guy is talking life in singapore for his kid only from his own POV which I think is....bad parenting? idk. I don't have kids lol.",

            "\"Weekend allowance\", \"occasional snack packs\" and \"online seminars on how to manage stress\" seem like laughably tepid measures that do not address the fundamental issue - overworked doctors and the threat to patient safety",
            "MOH : I guess I have to consider increasing the bond-breaking fee, blacklisting them for breaking bonds, or introducing more mandatory unpaid online courses.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, no one would want to sit in a bus or plane controlled by an overworked operator. So why trust a doctor who doesn't get enough sleep?",
            "Minister\u2019s pay: \u201cwe have to peg it to the private sector to attract and retain talent\u201d\nPublic sector junior doctor\u2019s pay: \u201cwe are unable to match the remuneration offered by the private sector.\u201d \n\n*pikachu face when doctors start breaking their bonds*\n\nAside from this whole remuneration issue, another grossly overlooked part is PATIENT SAFETY. How is having a 30-hour sleep deprived doctor in any way safe???",
            "Junior doctor here.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to even know where to start. There are so many deep-seated issues that sometimes I\u2019ve considered switching to GP work, but I\u2019ve chosen to stay.\n\nThe article is well-written, but I find the suggestion to lengthen the duration of conditional registration troubling. It feels like asking local graduates to extend their bonds even longer, which doesn\u2019t address the root problems. It\u2019s like treating sepsis with paracetamol without antibiotics \u2013 it misses the underlying cause. The real issue is that junior doctors are overworked, underpaid, and lack control over their lives, which drives many to leave.\n\nI often wish for significant improvements in the MOPEX system (the junior doctor work rostering system). Introducing differential pay for different postings sounds promising, but it raises questions: How do we decide which specialty is a \u201chardship\u201d posting? If renal medicine is considered difficult, what about cardiology or oncology? And if vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and neurosurgery are challenging, is general surgery really that much easier?\n\nUltimately, it depends on how much MOHH is willing to improve the system. Ideally, though it might be a long shot, we could implement a bidding system where junior doctors bid for their postings. Popular postings could come with lower pay, while less popular ones offer higher pay. For example, starting with a $1000 \u201cenhancement bonus\u201d and bidding down to $0 \u2013 those who really want a popular posting like Comm Hos might bid low, and the department would then choose from the lowest bidders. If no one bids for a tough specialty like cardiothoracic surgery, those doctors would get an extra $1000.",
            "I found Yip Hon Weng's quote particularly offensive. Medicine is a calling that requires dedication and sacrifice? And right before recommending policy changes that amount to punitive action? Fuck off with that bull shit. If MOH wants labour, it should pay market prices.",
            "They will do everything except to actually make things better for doctors... This is HR from hell sia.",
            "I broke bond.\n\nMy advice is... Just break it. Your mental health will thank you for it\n\nA certain moh admin HR guy once told us in a closed door session that we were all dispensible and were free to leave.\n\nIn the same vein Amy khor also said in parliament that sinkies are free to leave too if they don't like it here..\n\nMP Yip trying to gaslight you to say you guys are not passionate enough - politicians need to peg pay to private sector but docs cannot?\n\nhahahahahhahahahah\n\nHave never voted white and will never ever vote for people like him.",
            "It\u2019s a good call, I bid them well. Health is wealth",
            "Typical bullshit and nonsense from MOHH, MOM maximum work hours is 44h per week but they think working up to 80h a week is acceptable.\n\nIn any other company the employer would actively try to make their employees happy if possible. In MOHH it's like they're doing their best to turn every single junior doctor against them",
