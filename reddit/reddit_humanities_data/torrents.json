I don't mind it per se, I am just curious to understand what is going on and if I should block these IP's.\n\n  \nBasically, there will be a couple clients, all Chinese, that are requesting the file, in this case a movie. Sometimes the peers disappear and reappear, but a lot of the peers are the same. You can see that in this case, that I have uploaded 9Gib for one of the peers, while the file is only 3.90 GiB. Also, you can see the progress is at 0%. However, the screenshot does not do the madness justice, as the ratio of this file is over 110. \n\n  \nMy guess is that there is some git lab somewhere that has lists of torrents for movies, and the torrent I am seeding is on there. This doens't explain why the IP's appear to be the same. I would say that perhaps its like a VPN, however at that point why not download the movie once, and host it from yourself? So maybe a sort of proxy where the advertised IP is the same, but the data does not end up at the advertised IP. I don't know. \n\nI am curious to hear if anyone has had something like this happen before, what is going on, and if I should block them, or just stop seeding the torrent entirely.",

I've forwarded (and activated) port 50001 in for the IP of the host PC and have added it to the client.\n\n  \nEverything looks good, but I've sent the file to another computer to test it out and nothing happens, it gets added, but it doesn't begin downloading.
