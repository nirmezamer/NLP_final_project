Also side note my torrent was magnet link so i never downloaded anything, everything went to shit whenever i ran the installer so idk\n\nstay safe out there",

You'll be alright. uTorrent comes with bundled trash but it's not that serious of a threat.",

            "There's nothing wrong with utorrent, OP just didn't pay attention when they were clicking through the installer. Also most torrent clients do the exact same thing, so there's no real reason to go with qbittorrent in particular.",
            "Well the fact it comes bundled with trash no one would want on their PC is reason enough for most people to not use it. Qbittorrent is free and open source. Gotta love that.",
            "> it comes bundled with trash no one would want\n\nutorrent isn't the only free software that bundles other software \"offers\" in its installer. CCleaner does this as well, and it's considered one of the best (if not the top) drive cleaner.\n\n> Qbittorrent is free and open source.\n\nutorrent is free as well. Also the most recent security exploit in utorrent [is from 2018](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-6117/Utorrent.html) while the most recent qbittorrent exploit was discovered [only a few months ago.](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16171/Qbittorrent.html) On top of that, the exploit affects every version of qbittorrent since it was first released. Which is the *exact* situation that source code auditing is supposed to prevent. And yet that didn't happen.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it's interesting how utorrent is objectively safer to use than qbittorrent, despite not being open source.",
            "That vulnerability you're talking about in the end is user error. Sure, should have been programmed to force default credential change but come on, anyone enabling and setting up web interface should know to change those credentials. I'll test when I get home to see if that has been fixed though its probably able to be confirmed through Google. As 4.5.5 is no longer the current version.\n\nAlso, I'd rather have open source and the ability for anyone to audit the code than closed. And who knows what vulnerabilities might exist in uTorrent. Possibly ones that are known by malicious groups now and not being shared or reported. At least with qbittorrent there is the ability for anyone to look deep into the issues.\n\nGuess we'll have to agree to disagree but I can tell you the overall community of piracy and torrenting would back the qbittorrent position over the uTorrent position.",
            "Then CCleaner is trash too.",
            "> I'd rather have open source and the ability for anyone to audit the code than closed.\n\nIf qbittorrent's source code was being properly audited, that exploit wouldn't have gone undiscovered for so many years. So it would seem the qbittorrent community is comprised of a bunch of people who all think someone else is auditing the source code for them.\n\n> And who knows what vulnerabilities might exist in uTorrent.\n\nBlind speculation.\n\n> Possibly ones that are known by malicious groups now and not being shared or reported.\n\nThe irony is that malicious groups mod open-source torrent clients (like qbittorrent) into [cheater clients](https://reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1c30ytu/a_lot_of_chinese_adresses_at_once) that intentionally misreport download and upload stats to the tracker. Which is virtually impossible to do with a closed-source client.\n\n> I can tell you the overall community of piracy and torrenting would back the qbittorrent position over the uTorrent position.\n\nutorrent accounts for [70% of all torrent client installs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_BitTorrent_clients) whereas qbittorrent accounts for 3.4% - down from 18.75% just 5 years earlier.\n\nFor every person who installs qbittorrent, 20 people install utorrent."
