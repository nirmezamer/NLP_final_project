If it is a crash, be sure to read about [getting backtraces](https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Debugging/How_to_create_useful_crash_reports) so your report can assist the developers. If this is a known issue, you may want to include the bug report on your post so your fellow users experiencing the same thing can CC themselves to the report. Be sure to describe your issue well and with context. Thank you.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
