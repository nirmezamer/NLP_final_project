            "Survey...why exactly? We all know nobody's going to listen anyway.",
            "Manhunts are busy work designed to distract you from the daily grinding. Y6S2 will be that plus forcing you to play a character you dont want to. Just a hot garbage mess. The game would be better without manhunts at this point.",

            "Big No to seasons 2.0",

            "It\u2019s a silly survey. \u201cWould you recommend this to a friend?\u201d.\n\nMy friends bailed on Div2 during the recruiter season. I\u2019m the only agent left stupid enough to keep playing.\n\nI feel like this is just a PR thing. They have data and can make a more targetted survey honestly.",
            "Always fun to see who's paying attention - the survey is about *last* season.",
            "Alright. Nobody say \u201cI use Aegis + Mosquito as my primary gear.\u201d!",
            "well, I told them it's working really well that Y5S3 doesn't have seasonal characters",
            "\"How likely are you to recommend Tom Clancy's The Division 2 to a friend or colleague?\" - Well.. with seasonal characters? Not at all likely."

We'll rate it!   \n\n---\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Post pictures of your agent, decked from head to toe, from The Division.\n\n* No down talking, we all have different looks we care about.

            "I hated the 1 arm sling because I know what its like to run in a one arm sling pack, it sucks. So it seems like a good agent would never opt to use an unsecured bag. I know division is a pseudo fantasy game but this is just my opinion.",
            "I love the sling bags from Div 1. Right around the time the first game came out, I had purchased a sling that I had for a while. It was stolen out of my car a while back. Useful for everyday carry. Ended up buying another one about a year ago. \n\nhttps://tacticalgear.com/condor-sling-bag-black?sku=con-140-002&ft=e3f7bec5-8df6-438f-88ce-592a9bedc97a&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwvvmzBhA2EiwAtHVrb0PQbR_LQZMxNKGC-Y4dBh23HwxzB2Y4dtpUYXg_QpmqkqKaE3slXRoCkXMQAvD_BwE#/24960/653/1&dl=b&catr=1",

            "Lore wide it make sense \u2026 sling bad where the bugout bag of division 1. Made for a quick reaction type mission. Division 2 is more for the long run. So advanced backpack make more sense \u2026",
            "I bought a sling backpack for school, then eventually went back to a standard two-strap backpack because of how annoying and uncomfortable they actually were..\n\nBut you can't deny how cool and uniquely aesthetic they had become to the franchise, which was why I bought it in the first place lol"

Cause a couple years ago I bought a PS4 and like 8 games from GameStop and I bought the warranty for all of them, one of the games kept breaking when trying to load in and the controller that came with the console had stick shift, took both in and got the game replaced for free and I was able to trade the controller in for a new controller and only had to pay like 20%, so even though GameStop is shit when it comes to buying your games, consoles, etc, they've got a really good warranty and trade back system",
