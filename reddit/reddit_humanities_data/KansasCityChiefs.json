        "content": "I was rewatching clips of old Super Bowls, and of course, I came across the Pats-Seahawks Super Bowl when Russell Wilson was picked off by Malcolm Butler at the 1, sealing the game for the Patriots. Obviously since they had the best RB in the NFL at the time in Marshawn Lynch, this was viewed as a very stupid decision.\n\nI also realized how eerily similar this was to Andy's final play in the Super Bowl this year. He also ran a trick play which involved Mahomes throwing the ball to Hardman at the 1, not handing it off to Pacheco. Even though this worked out for us, it's crazy how Hardman timed the motion switching his run perfectly. He needed to time that motion perfectly, which is why he was left wide open and Ward's eyes went to the next guy inside. It's just crazy how if that motion wasn't timed perfectly, the 49ers probably would have won on a pick.\n\nIt just shows how brilliant the Chiefs really are.",

            "The thing about the Pats-Seahawks Super Bowl is the Pats defense practiced defending that specific play a ton leading up to the game. I wonder if the 49ers practiced defending that final play we ran.",
            "Whoa there, JC was the best running back in the NFL at the time.\n\nAlso it was supposed to be an inside shovel pass, the corn dog action was just backup, but it worked (again!).",
            "It wasnt nearly as risky of a pass and the first read on that play is the little forward shovel to McKinnon which is essentially a run play anyway. He threw it out there because a) defense defended the shovel and b) it was a wide open pitch and catch with no defender anywhere even remotely close.",
            "I think the difference here is that the play called WAS a handoff to Pacheco. Mahomes just had an out if Bosa came crashing down which he took.",
            "The big difference is that QB1 isnt Russell Wilson and thus would have thrown the ball away or ran it if there was a chance of an INT.",
            "I honestly think Hardman is at his best when Mahomes is his QB. Going back to Hardman's early days they always had a chemistry that would come up in big moments. They wouldn't always connect, but there were times it was just magic. I am so glad Hardman got to catch the game-winner in overtime of the Super Bowl. After being a castoff for the Jets. Guy comes back home and has that legendary moment that is gonna be played in highlight reels for decades to come.",
            "I disagree wholeheartedly. Running the ball instead of passing for the Chiefs in that situations is literally the same thing as taking the ball out of Lynchs hand. Let your best players (Lynch/Mahomes respectively) decide the biggest games.\n\nAnd I also disagree that Corn Dog is a trick play.",
            "Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll are not Mahomes and Reid",
            "I would lose my mind if we lost a Superbowl because Andy tried to run it in that situation. Like it would literally fall out of my face onto the floor. No idea why the defence would think it's anything other than a pass.",
            "Don't think about how bad the pass could have gone when it went right, just focus on the future. Worrying about the past does nothing but add unnecessary stress"
