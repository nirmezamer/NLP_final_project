            "Scriptwriter lazy confirmed :)",
            "I don\u2019t think those games are really all that comparable. Mahomes struggled in the first half, but he came out and tore them a new one in the second half. Frankly he vastly out performed Brady who threw 2 picks and should have lost the game on a third.\n\nCompare that to the Ravens game, Lamar just straight up didn\u2019t look ready for the moment.\u00a0\n\nFrankly the biggest similarity between the two is that the Chiefs deserved to win.",
            "Lamar has been in the league for one less season than Mahomes. Like yeah Lamar has been hurt and hasn\u2019t played in as many playoff games, but I don\u2019t know if I really would call Lamar less experienced than Mahomes in anything other than super bowls\u2026\n\nAlso the patriots were still in the midst (albeit the end) of an incredible run of winning over almost two decades. I\u2019m not sure the hate for Mahomes and the Chiefs is even close to what it was for the Patriots. Give it another 10 years though\u2026",
            "What were you right about? That KC would beat Baltimore?",
            "Calling Lamar Jackson less experienced is a stretch.  Sure mahomes has played more games but not by anywhere near the margin between Brady and Mahomes in 2019",

            "Yeah. Dee ford, and the rest of the defense lost us that game, mahomes played just as good if not better than brady"
