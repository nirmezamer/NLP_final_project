            "And a substancial part of this is probably just the casing.",

            "Best part, it can be reused. For real, the tech behind recycling nuclear waste into useable nuclear energy is old the problem with doing it is of course politics.",
            "You should see what 20 years of coal slag, ash, carbon dioxide, and various toxic chemicals look like.\n\nOh, you can't, because instead of being stuck in some nice concrete barrels, they're in your lungs and your water and your land, giving you cancer and literally killing well over a million people a year.\n\nIt's utterly insanity to think that a few barrels worth of completely contained toxic waste is a problem, but dumping billions of tons of toxic chemicals into our environment is fine, because hey, it's not a problem you have to deal with anymore.",
            "And yet some people throw an absolute hissy fit when you actually show them that the \u201cwaste\u201d from nuclear is next to nothing when looking at other alternatives.\n\nThe waste is also not even fully depleted, It\u2019s still good for another few thousand years, so the possibilities are endless.\n\nIt\u2019s also a lot safer than some people seem to believe. Safety has come along way, and the chances of another Chernobyl happening is close to 0, unless something absolutely catastrophic happens.",
            "It's a good thing they're storing it and not dumping it in the seas.",
            "Apparently the spent fuel rods can be reused. Someone I\u2019m sure can expand more on this.",
            "bruh i expected more than that honestly"
