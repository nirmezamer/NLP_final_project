        "content": "If you already read the sticky post titled 'some reminders about /r/learnart for old and new members', then thank you, you've already read this, so continue on as usual! \n\nSince a lot of people didn't bother, \n\n* [We have a wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/wiki/index) There's starter packs for basic drawing, composition, and figure drawing. Read the FAQ before you post a question. \n\n* **We're here to work**. Everything else that follows can be summed up by that. \n\n* What to post: Post your drawings or paintings for critique. Post practical, technical questions about drawing or painting: tools, techniques, materials, etc. Post informative tutorials with lots of clear instruction. (Note that that says: \"Post YOUR drawings etc\", not \"Post someone else's\". If someone wants a critique they can sign up and post it themselves.) \n\n* What not to post: **Literally anything else.** A speedpaint video? No. \"Art is hard and I'm frustrated and want to give up\" rants? No. A funny meme about art? No. Links to  your social media? No. \n\n* What to comment: Constructive criticism with examples of what works or doesn't work. Suggestions for learning resources. Questions & answers about the artwork, working process, or learning process. \n\n* What not to comment: **Literally anything else.** \"I love it!\", \"It reminds me of X,\" \"Ha ha boobies\"? No. \"Is it for sale?\" No; DM them and ask them that. \"What are your socials?\" Look at their profile; if they don't have them there, DM them about it.\n\n* If you want specific advice about your work, *post examples of your work*. If you just ask a general question, you'll get a bunch of general answers you could've just googled for. \n\n* Take clear, straight on photos of your work. If it's at a weird angle or in bad lighting, you're making it harder for folks to give you advice on it. And save the artfully arranged photos with all your drawing tools, a flower, and your cat for Instagram.\n\n* If you expect people to put some effort into a critique, put some effort into your work. Don't post something you doodled in the corner of your notebook during class.\n\n* If you host your images anywhere other than on Reddit itself or Imgur, there's a pretty good chance it'll get flagged as spam. Pinterest especially; the automod bot hates that, despite me trying to set it to allow them.",

            "Heres an old trick from Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Turn the photo upside down and then draw it. It forces your brain to look at the lines and form rather than oh this is how an eye looks or this is how a nose looks. The results can be pretty dramatic!",
            "before reading I saw it and thought wow a drawing of Dave Chappelle as a baby and was really impressed",
            "Have you tried overlaying your image over the reference to see where you went wrong?",
            "I think the main issue is that the photo was taken at a low angle, and you're drawing as if you're looking at him straight on. This is making the proportions of his face look wrong. \n\nYou've captured his essence though! Good luck ",
            "Try overlaying the drawing over the photograph (translucent layers.) This will show you where the proportions are off.",
            "His face is longer than your drawing. His philtrum and lower face are quite long while the eyes and nose are compact.\n\nYou're doing a great job  this is really good! It's all a matter of practice and training your eye.",
            "It looks like baby Chappelle.  A lot of its the eyes are more open and cartoonish in your drawing. Youve drawn his mouth more open as well.",
            "The chubby cheeks in his smile need to be a little higher/tighter and a bit more pronounced",
            "A good thing to remember when trying to draw things realistically, is that you shouldn't draw a hard outline of every feature. You should use shading and value to create depth over hard lines. A great example here is the teeth. You do not need to draw all the teeth individually and outline all of them (It makes the teeth appear spaced out and scary looking) Try to get a move general shape of all the teeth together and only put hard lines where they need to be. You're not doing too bad though, keep up the good work!",

            "Action is really hard to follow from page 10 onwards",
            "This is great! I would recommend using a different font for the dialogue. Its the only thing that threw me off. Professional comics all use a similar font style. Im sure you can download one for free online.\n\nOther than that it looks incredible",
            "Man this looks fucking AWESOME!\n\nLove the panelling",
            "Is it the shading? Or camera placement? What could I do to make it more clear?",
            "Thanks! What are some other fonts that I could use alternatively?",
            "Thanks friend! Do you have any tips or feedback? Anything confusing you about the pages?",
            "I recommend changing the font to something more organic in a way. Theres websites that allow you to turn your personal handwriting into a usable font, even!\n\nAlso, the repetition of the action shots make them difficult to follow. Itd be useful to have a couple of shots in the middle that show the characters relative to the background (not just the action hashing), and maybe some small lines throughout.\n\nAnd last point! Intensifying line weight/visibility a tad for the characters in smaller squares. Like with the bottom of square 6!",
            "Pretty cool stuff!\n\nId say for the action scenes you need more breaks in the action. If you have too many movement panels and impact panels back to back, it all starts to blur together and is harder to follow. Good action breaks are ones that can re-establish the scene and give the reader a moment to digest the ebb and flow of the fight. \n\nFor example, when the Tyrant is using the whip, after his flurry of attacks the Automaton catches the final hit. Instead of moving straight into him smashing it in his hand, pause for a moment and maybe have a dialogue exchange. Something simple like I can adapt to any fighting style. Even yours. And then smash the ball tip. Gives the reader a break and presents the change in the flow of combat where the automaton will lead the action.",
            "Yup, I've got some feedback on the font styling.\n\nWhere could I insert a few background shots around here for example? What shots could I eliminate?\n\nOn your last point, you recommend using more intense line weight for characters to stand out of the background in general, like the bottom panels on page 6 could use more?",
            "I feel like it isnt really a matter of eliminating, but more of adding pauses. I feel like mostly for slides 9 onwards a few extra small scenes would benefit it, like maybe adding a character setting up for an attack, the same way a hunting spider or a snake doesnt immediately attack but looks tall before lunging.\n\nAnd yes, exactly that! It felt like some of the lines came off too meek and if youre planning on keeping them black and white, they dont really lure the reader in. \n\nBut as whole the comic is great, your art style is really cool! Its genuinely all just fine-tuning from here on out. I forgot to mention that in the og comment :))"
