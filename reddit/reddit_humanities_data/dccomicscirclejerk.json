            "I know most of y\u2019all don\u2019t use tumblr, but I was trying to go through the Jonathan Kent tag on tumblr last night and there was so much Danny Phantom x DC crossover stuff I felt like I blocking every other post.\nAnyways, that reminded me of the \u201clets see the ship numbers of the batfamily\u201d (and too much was Miraculous Ladybug crossovers) that happened a few months ago.",

            "I picked up a whole bunch of comics on Sunday, been really enjoying Superboy Secret Identity!",
            "Just read the new Zatanna book from today. So good. Javier Rodriguez art is impeccable as always and while its a out of continuity take of the character I took to the premise as quickly as they introduced it. I know Mariko Tamaki is a mixed bag but this was a fantastic start.",
            "Honestly that's the last book from him that i enjoyed. That MJ issue is still one of my all time faves.",
            "So good. I wish we got more of Kamala, Miles, Sam and Nadia as part of the Avengers mainline together."
