        "content": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/about/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/about/rules)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we are going live with our primary rule overhaul in order to keep the subreddit rules in tune with the modern needs of the community. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rules were old and sometimes edited and added to, but over the years reddit has changed and our community has changed to the extent that it made sense to completely start from scratch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept a lot of the rules that we were actively moderating for, but have removed some rules that are no longer relevant. When the subreddit started the rule \"Content must be about cats\" made sense, but we do not need to expressly codify this anymore. We're not a small community these days and it has not happened in years that someone posted a bunny rabbit instead of a cat. We will of course still remove off-topic content but do not see the need to clutter up the rules page with something that our community understands to be self-evident. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will likely make minor edits and additions to this new rule-set in the coming weeks until everything is just the way we like it, but the rules as posted now are the general framework from which we will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept our rules broadly worded so they can encompass many topics and so we do not need to codify for every single possibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important rules are at the top. Our number one rule is to respect each other. This for example includes following rediquette and sitewide rules, but also our subreddit-specific rule of not attacking other posters for not raising their pets to your satisfaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rule about spam, memes and self-promotion includes  accounts that do not directly promote their content, but which nevertheless primarily exist to drive content to their NSFW stores like Onlyfans. Everyone is welcome to post here, but NSFW sellers can do so on a seperate, SFW account. We do not allow memes as they are most often posted as easy karma-grabs instead of genuine engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our new ruleset via the link at the top of this thread and give your feedback in a comment below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for helping us make this space the wonderful community that it is and we hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe r/cats mod team",

            "Okay, I don't know how to put this into words, but I'll try. Every post I've seen recently from this sub is a sad story about the death of a beloved cat. Perhaps this is a me problem, and I really don't want to say that people shouldn't mourn, but it's always extreme for me to see this kind of post. Especially if it's the only type of content that is making it to the front page.",

This was brought up earlier in the thread, but I feel like the \"mourning/loss\" tag is hardly being used and enforced. I know pet loss is not easy, but every day I scroll through Reddit, I'm hiding multiple posts from this sub reddit that aren't tagged properly. Can I scroll by them? Yes. But as someone else also said, I don't want to see them consistently in my face. It's made me debate between staying or leaving the sub quite a few times.",

I help people harness train their cats in a way that is enjoyable and stress-free for both human and kitty. AMA!\n\nMaybe you\u2019re wondering if harness training is right for your cat, need some pointers on how to get your cat started, or perhaps you\u2019ve hit a little roadblock in your harness training and need some advice?\n\nOr, maybe you have an adventurous kitty and are looking for tips on advanced scenarios like backpack training, safely managing dog encounters, or even navigating #vanlife with your cat. Whatever your questions, I\u2019m excited to answer them!\n\n**Feel free to post your questions here and I'll start responding from Saturday June 29th 2024 at 10AM PDT / 1PM EDT / 6PM BST / 7PM CEST.**\n\nHere\u2019s a tip to get us started: Did you know that the position you hold your cat\u2019s leash in can play a big part in preventing harness escapes?\u00a0\n\nBy keeping the leash in the \u2018safe zone\u2019 when it is under tension (diagram here: https://imgur.com/a/pHi7y5i), you can avoid giving your cat the low angles it needs to pull their harness off over their heads (AKA backing out). This little trick can make a big difference in keeping your cat safe & secure outside!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e94fqir5oc9d1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce74c0ca7999ae74da8f274a2361b00b6df8e645",

            "Hi! Me and my Kitty completed your 10 day bootcamp training and my Kitty now can walk freely harnessed inside. But I desperately need help with the rest of training (the going outside part). I have a cat stroller and I thought I could just slowly start bringing her outside in the stroller, but it stressed her out. Even though I did what everyone said, by slowly walking her only inside the apartment in the stroller. And eventually going outside (even just staying on the porch in the stroller). I have to be missing something. \n\nI desperately need the next training! But its so expensive, I can't afford it. I've been hoping it would eventually have a sale. I get emails all the time with the harnesses and collars on sale, but I never see the training course having a sale. Is there any chance the training course can have a sale? The 10 day bootcamp was so helpful and I really want to continue the process!"
