        "content": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/about/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/about/rules)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we are going live with our primary rule overhaul in order to keep the subreddit rules in tune with the modern needs of the community. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rules were old and sometimes edited and added to, but over the years reddit has changed and our community has changed to the extent that it made sense to completely start from scratch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept a lot of the rules that we were actively moderating for, but have removed some rules that are no longer relevant. When the subreddit started the rule \"Content must be about cats\" made sense, but we do not need to expressly codify this anymore. We're not a small community these days and it has not happened in years that someone posted a bunny rabbit instead of a cat. We will of course still remove off-topic content but do not see the need to clutter up the rules page with something that our community understands to be self-evident. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will likely make minor edits and additions to this new rule-set in the coming weeks until everything is just the way we like it, but the rules as posted now are the general framework from which we will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept our rules broadly worded so they can encompass many topics and so we do not need to codify for every single possibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important rules are at the top. Our number one rule is to respect each other. This for example includes following rediquette and sitewide rules, but also our subreddit-specific rule of not attacking other posters for not raising their pets to your satisfaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rule about spam, memes and self-promotion includes  accounts that do not directly promote their content, but which nevertheless primarily exist to drive content to their NSFW stores like Onlyfans. Everyone is welcome to post here, but NSFW sellers can do so on a seperate, SFW account. We do not allow memes as they are most often posted as easy karma-grabs instead of genuine engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our new ruleset via the link at the top of this thread and give your feedback in a comment below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for helping us make this space the wonderful community that it is and we hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe r/cats mod team",

Perhaps this is a me problem, and I really don't want to say that people shouldn't mourn, but it's always extreme for me to see this kind of post. Especially if it's the only type of content that is making it to the front page.",

It doesn\u2019t excuse him being outside where anything could happen to him, but just wanted to reassure you that him being thin doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anyone has been starving him.\n\nIf you\u2019re really concerned, and if his collar doesn\u2019t have his owners info on it, I\u2019d recommend getting him into a carrier and taking him to a vet. If he has a microchip they can contact the owners, and they should also be able to tell you if he\u2019s being neglected or if he\u2019s just old.",

            "A neighbor a block over adopted a second cat. The cats didn't get along so they put the newly adopted cat outside a lot to elevate the fighting. This poor little guy started wandering around the neighborhood looking for friendly people. It started hanging out at our house. I called the phone number on the collar and the people said, yeah that's our cat, but didn't seem to care where it was or how it was doing. \n\nIf I wasn't careful about how I opened an external door this little guy would find his way in. We'd wake up in the in the middle of the night to find this little guy sleeping at the end of our bed. I kept asking the owners to do the right thing and take the cat to the humane society to be re-homed, or try to find a new home themselves. They really didn't care. \n\nI just couldn't see this fellow living like this. We took him in. A few months passed and the people that adopted him first called to see if we'd seen their cat. And if we had could they come and get it. I said, no, I haven't see your cat, but I definitely have seen mine and he's happy here. Please don't call back. \n\nChances are this little cat is being neglected. The people don't care. If they did, it probably wouldn't be so skinny. Have your vet or local shelter scan it for a chip. If they can't id an owner put some fliers up. If nobody claims them, you have a wonderful new addition to your family.",
            "Chances are, that skinny, he got lost and can't find his way home.\n\nTake him in, have him scanned at the vet, and post to the local humane society/vet pages that you've got a found cat.\n\nHe may be abandoned, he may be lost and missed, and he may be so far or have been gone for so long that no one thinks he's still out there.\nBut he's definitely starving and in need, so I would take him in.",
