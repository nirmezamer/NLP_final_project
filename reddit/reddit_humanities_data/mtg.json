        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nLet me introduce myself: I'm a new mod.\n\nAnyways, now that this is out of the way let's get to business. There was recently a call for moderator action. This got us thinking about what the community needs and wants. There are currently three principles that we follow:\n\n1. No violating Reddit's Terms of Service or sitewide rules\n2. No content that is not Magic-related\n3. Team has as little involvement as possible\\*\n\nThese three principles will stay. The sub will remain as open as possible. We can build on top of these. There are other subs that have stricter rules \\[enforcement\\] and if that is more your cup of tea we suggest you try those subs out, too!\n\nHowever! As mentioned before there was a call for more involvement from the team. This is where you come in: \n\n# What would you like to see the team do?\n\nGeneral discussion, concepts and guidelines, please. Keep real life examples to a minimum in order to avoid needlessly going on unrelated tangents. This post is\u00a0*not*\u00a0intended to be a political forum, rather, a brainstorming session.\n\nWe wish to retain the open atmosphere here, which means there won't be strict rules nor will there be strict rules enforcement. This doesn't mean we let the sub go haywire. This does, however, mean that the power is yours! Reddit's guidelines suggest that downvoting is intended as a tool to hide irrelevant information. It's widely used as a sign of disagreement but remember that if a post or a comment gets enough downvotes it gets hidden. Use this to your advantage.\n\nMost egregious cases that aren't caught by the extensive filters we have in place should still be obviously reported. On top of that you're also always welcome to approach us via modmail. (There's currently a bit of backlog so bear with us.)\n\nThank you for reading and looking forward to your opinions and ideas!",

            "All new mods should make a post about their nice new pulls from their most recent box opening to summon this subs resident spooky man and let him know you in fact did not draft the cards with friends. They're apparently dangerous, so be sure to bring a helmet.",
            "The vast majority of posters here want a certain user to stop posting their repetitive spam messages regarding limited play. \n\nIf those messages were the sum total of their contribution to the subreddit, I don\u2019t think we would have an issue. Unfortunately, their aggressive and hostile demeanor to honest correction, open debate, and constructive criticism is tantamount to harassment. \n\nThe moderators need to have a conversation with them about his contributions to this community. I would love for the user in question to share draft resources, deck building tips, and ways to play limited in threads that don\u2019t involve someone posting their play booster pulls and don\u2019t target specific individuals with judgment and insults. \n\nMy read from this post is that you\u2019re not planning on taking any action on this, however. You\u2019re not going to get much buy in from this community for your \u201cwe want to run an unmoderated subreddit\u201d approach, whatever supposed principles you use to justify it.",
            "Just out of curiosity, what separates this mod team from r/Freemagic\n\nThey are both low moderation subs, but they have very very distinct cultures. Is this just based on the users, or is there a different moderation philosophy. I\u2019ve always been curious about why this huge difference exists",
            "This sub doesnt have a purpose. There is already the Main sub, joke subs, card pull subs, subs for each format, proxy subs, custom card subs and rules subs.\n\nWithout rules and mods on this sub its descended into a pretty crap sub full of low effort posts and the same questions day in and day out most of which could be found with a 2 second google search.\n\nThe only thing this sub has is a better name and the drinking game I created",
            "I think it's funny that a whole new mod had to be brought to this sub just because the other two mods were too lazy to just ban a user causing problems.",
            "1. How about a sidebar, with maybe like *a rule at all of any kind whatsoever*. Some FAQs? Links to resources? \n\n2. Post flair and user flair. \n\n3. Daily/weekly posts for things like FAQs, rules questions, community engagement/creator spotlights.",
            "a major sidebar update would be helpful.",
            "It does seem that a lot of people offer their opinions or rather judgements about many questions. These can often be patronising, non-constructive, and may push people away from the mtg community in general.\n\nNew players should always be encouraged and helped in every way possible, and as new players, they may not know about the best ways to find rulings, interactions, card searches, etc.\n\nRemember, we were all new to the game at one point or another, and without patience and help from more experienced and knowledgeable players, we may not still love this crazy cardboard game.",
            "Remove any post for good pulls and put them in one long thread.\nSame with deck building advice and ruling questions."
