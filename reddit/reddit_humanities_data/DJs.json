        "content": "New /r/DJs  Rules.\n\n\n**Top rule - BE NICE.**\n\n* Please try to be polite, friendly and helpful when commenting.\n* Trolling, slapfights, general assholery is not encouraged and it also goes without saying that **racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic posts and language will not be tolerated** at all.\n\n**Moderation policy**\n\n* /r/DJs is not a big sub.  We tend to encourage discussion and engagement first and foremost.  There will be times posts that are seemingly against the sub rules will be left up because the discussion in the comments is informative and engaging.  This is generally more for when a post breaking (certain) rules was missed and the community has already heavily engaged in discussion.  If you see posts breaking the rules, reporting them will help us remove them earlier.\n* remember to search - lots of questions tend to be asked multiple times and plenty of answers are given in the archives\n* remember that if you are a regular user, newer users are allowed to discuss the same things if it's not overly-frequent.  Just because something was discussed 3 months ago doesn't mean users can't have another conversation about it.\n\n\n**Please ensure you are posting to the correct subreddit**\n\n * /r/DJs is generally for more experienced/professional DJ discussion.  There is an entire subreddit dedicated to learning DJing and is filled with experienced DJs willing to spend time helping people out.\n\n**Any and all beginner questions and posts should be made in /r/Beatmatch.**\n\n*Beginner questions include posts that start with:*\n \n* \u201cI\u2019m new at this\u201d\n* \u201cI want to get into DJing\u201d\n* \u201cI just started\u201d\n* etc.\n\n*And includes anything basic like:*\n\n* \u201cWhat controller/headphones/speakers should I buy?\u201d (within reason - someone experienced looking for higher end gear or looking for real world feedback on pro-level stuff is fine).\n* \u201cWhat program should I use?\u201d\n* \u201cHow do I use this effect?\u201d\n* \u201cIs beat matching really important?\u201d\n* \u201cWhy the hate for sync?\u201d\n* etc.\n\n*Any beginner posts here will be deleted.*\n\n\n**DJ Setup pictures belong in /r/DJsetups.**\n\n* There will be some exceptions - some rare or classic booths or extraordinary setups will stay up, but if you want to post a picture of your DDJ 400 and KRK Rockits, your Technics 1200s and DDJ S9, or a standard CDJ NXS setup that we've all seen, please post to the appropriate sub.\n\n**Meme/Humor/crappy image posts belong in /r/DJsCircleJerk.**\n\n* This includes the low effort, \"djs be like dis\u201d - *stupid picture* - type posts and the like.\n\n**Mixes**\n\n* Most mix posts will be deleted. \n* Short routines, showcasing of interesting technique, and videos that shows off the poster doing something cool is fine. We will also allow high profile posts - say if a regular user gets a feature mix on DJCity or a Serato sponsored set.\n* Sets from high profile DJs like boiler room or festivals sets is allowed.\n* DJs who want to share mixes can post in /r/mixes or a weekly mix thread that we will be starting soon.\n\n**Gig pictures/Stories**\n\n* We're starting a new weekly sticky every Monday specifically for gig pictures and stories.  We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.\n\n**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**\n\n* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.\n* For-sale posts\n* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. \n* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.\n* Posts asking \u201cwhat should I play for this gig?\u201d  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.\n* Spotify playlist posts\n\nPLEASE REPORT posts and comments that violate the above rules or just suck. Thank you!",

I've seen too many electronic music boards die due to pretentious snobbery (metacritic, gamefaqs, whatsapp groups) which simply turns everyone off and the board is left with 5-6 elitists who then have no one to pick on. I for one would like to see this rule seriously enforced to upkeep the livelihood of this sub.",
