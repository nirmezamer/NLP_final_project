        "content": "New /r/DJs  Rules.\n\n\n**Top rule - BE NICE.**\n\n* Please try to be polite, friendly and helpful when commenting.\n* Trolling, slapfights, general assholery is not encouraged and it also goes without saying that **racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic posts and language will not be tolerated** at all.\n\n**Moderation policy**\n\n* /r/DJs is not a big sub.  We tend to encourage discussion and engagement first and foremost.  There will be times posts that are seemingly against the sub rules will be left up because the discussion in the comments is informative and engaging.  This is generally more for when a post breaking (certain) rules was missed and the community has already heavily engaged in discussion.  If you see posts breaking the rules, reporting them will help us remove them earlier.\n* remember to search - lots of questions tend to be asked multiple times and plenty of answers are given in the archives\n* remember that if you are a regular user, newer users are allowed to discuss the same things if it's not overly-frequent.  Just because something was discussed 3 months ago doesn't mean users can't have another conversation about it.\n\n\n**Please ensure you are posting to the correct subreddit**\n\n * /r/DJs is generally for more experienced/professional DJ discussion.  There is an entire subreddit dedicated to learning DJing and is filled with experienced DJs willing to spend time helping people out.\n\n**Any and all beginner questions and posts should be made in /r/Beatmatch.**\n\n*Beginner questions include posts that start with:*\n \n* \u201cI\u2019m new at this\u201d\n* \u201cI want to get into DJing\u201d\n* \u201cI just started\u201d\n* etc.\n\n*And includes anything basic like:*\n\n* \u201cWhat controller/headphones/speakers should I buy?\u201d (within reason - someone experienced looking for higher end gear or looking for real world feedback on pro-level stuff is fine).\n* \u201cWhat program should I use?\u201d\n* \u201cHow do I use this effect?\u201d\n* \u201cIs beat matching really important?\u201d\n* \u201cWhy the hate for sync?\u201d\n* etc.\n\n*Any beginner posts here will be deleted.*\n\n\n**DJ Setup pictures belong in /r/DJsetups.**\n\n* There will be some exceptions - some rare or classic booths or extraordinary setups will stay up, but if you want to post a picture of your DDJ 400 and KRK Rockits, your Technics 1200s and DDJ S9, or a standard CDJ NXS setup that we've all seen, please post to the appropriate sub.\n\n**Meme/Humor/crappy image posts belong in /r/DJsCircleJerk.**\n\n* This includes the low effort, \"djs be like dis\u201d - *stupid picture* - type posts and the like.\n\n**Mixes**\n\n* Most mix posts will be deleted. \n* Short routines, showcasing of interesting technique, and videos that shows off the poster doing something cool is fine. We will also allow high profile posts - say if a regular user gets a feature mix on DJCity or a Serato sponsored set.\n* Sets from high profile DJs like boiler room or festivals sets is allowed.\n* DJs who want to share mixes can post in /r/mixes or a weekly mix thread that we will be starting soon.\n\n**Gig pictures/Stories**\n\n* We're starting a new weekly sticky every Monday specifically for gig pictures and stories.  We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.\n\n**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**\n\n* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.\n* For-sale posts\n* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. \n* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.\n* Posts asking \u201cwhat should I play for this gig?\u201d  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.\n* Spotify playlist posts\n\nPLEASE REPORT posts and comments that violate the above rules or just suck. Thank you!",

            "Thank you for this. I've seen too many electronic music boards die due to pretentious snobbery (metacritic, gamefaqs, whatsapp groups) which simply turns everyone off and the board is left with 5-6 elitists who then have no one to pick on. I for one would like to see this rule seriously enforced to upkeep the livelihood of this sub."

There were less DJs and it wasn't exactly as mainstream so everyone felt like being in a special club - especially for the more underground scenes.",
            "I wasn't very organized with my records. I just played on feel and sight as far as cover art etc. I miss that style. Just not the physical aspect of carrying anvil cases and crates of records",

            "It kills me to see all these \"vinyl sets\" out there... back then we had to bring like 4 crates of vinyl for gigs, and carry them upstairs or whatever. I love my vinyl, but I really don't wanna carry them crates ever again. I'm old!",

            "Good times! I remember before my brother bought some Pioneer belt drives and a Pyramid mixer I would mix two different mixed cassettes by quickly hitting the pause button to slow it down and catch the beat. Bedroom dj playing around. DEFINITELY don\u2019t miss lugging around equipment. Thank god for technology \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",
            "I sure don't miss those events where I lugged in dozens of flight cases of vynil and CDs and also several humongous speakers. I certainly don't miss playing 7 inch 45s anymore either. Toilet breaks were short and often with one leg wet no matter how much for e you put into it \ud83e\udd23",
            "To be fair, before you go thinking that old school vinyl DJs had superpowers, it\u2019s worth realising that little mistakes and technical problems were much more common (and more tolerated) than they are these days. Andy C has always been an absolute machine, but that kind of perfection certainly wasn\u2019t the norm in the 90s.\n\nIt was a really fun time for DJing. I was massively into jungle/d&b in the 90s/00s and it was normal to hear a bit of trainwrecking even from big name DJs, and not unusual to have a needle that keeps skipping. As long as it wasn\u2019t happening constantly nobody really minded, and it just contributed to the chaotic energy that makes d&b nights so good. There was even some sloppy mixing on commercially released mix CDs, bizarre as that might sound.\n\nI notice that in boiler room sets whenever a clumsy dancer accidentally pauses a CDJ everyone has a good laugh about it and it\u2019s usually the most rewatched part of the YouTube video. As slick and perfect as modern digital DJing technology is, there\u2019s still a lot of charm to fuck-ups."

            "In the business world in general, it is not that uncommon that invoices or payment have a certain turn around time (can be weekly, bi-weekly, every 30 days, dependant on how the company operates).\n\nSo if it was always a 30 day turn around, yeah it isn't ideal or convenient for you, but not outside the realm of normal.\n\nAs with any intermediary business model (which promoting is) they need time to collect money from various sources, ticket sales, 3rd party agreements etc, and time to collate, audit, and distribute funds.  That is exactly why a certain time frame between you playing and being paid could be expected and fair.\n\nSaying that, it sounds like this isn't the case for you, and payments/invoices aren't having a regular turn around period, and in fact are having a sporadic and inconsistent turn around, which is definitely not normal, but more importantly not fair at all, you have provided a service, completed your side of the contract, and should be treated with a certain level of respect for doing so.\n\nObviously in the DJ industry, things are not quite as strict or regulated as more normal business oriented industries, but that doesn't mean you should be worried about being paid or having to chase it.\n\nAre you writing/signing contracts with this promotor?  If so are payment terms and turnarounds notified in these contracts?  I am going to assume there are no official written agreements though and its more a verbal contract, which seems likely here.\n\nLong and short of it, they are being unprofessional by not agreeing payment terms, including dates/turn around times in advance, and they are being unprofessional making you wait for payments or making you chase payments, and not offering written contracts, then yeah, they are 100% in the wrong, it is a pretty serious business faux pas and a red flag for future dealings.\n\nSaying that, \"Would I be wrong for agreeing to play, and then ghosting\" absolutely, that would make you a grade A twat just like the promoter.  It MIGHT make you feel slightly better for 10 mins like you got one up on them, but it would massively tarnish your own professional reputation.\n\nIf you want to play this event, and have agreed to do so, then play it, not for them, but for you.\n\nIn future, ask for more official terms and conditions of service, including a written agreement (doesn't need to be a high court level document) outlining the responsibilities and expectations of both you and the client.  If they break this, then you know it is time to stop doing business with them, and nobody can call you out on it because you tried to be accommodating and professional and above board in every way you could.",
            "That's one way to prove a point and forever burn a bridge",
            "It would be totally fair to communicate with him that you only plan on showing up after receiving payment. That way everything is clear and everything is in writing. After that, it\u2019s totally appropriate not to show up. Totally inappropriate of him not to pay you timely",
            "It's very normal for big names to require 1/3 on contract signing, 1/3 7 days before the show and the remainder within 2 weeks after the show. Most wedding djs will also take a deposit to secure the booking. \n\nIf your request hasn't been fulfilled I would hit him up directly and sort it out. There's a very high chance that he doesn't have the money to run the show before collecting his earnings so you are taking in his risk by not getting laid until much after. If you're happy taking that risk that's cool, perhaps you should also become a promoter because then you can take that risk and also get some reward when it goes well\n\nLife's way to short to be constantly chasing payments",
            "Sometimes we put ourselves in situations like this because our hearts are in a different place then our mind is ur heart says he's a friend but ur mind says it's business..allow NOONE to take advantage of your hard work NOONE,that's just my opinion...",
            "> I requested half of the payment beforehand to \u201csecure the date.\u201d\n\nDid he agree?\n\nAll the other gigs...you got paid?....if so\n\nShow up and play, set meeting and discuss your issues....Not playing will cost you more then just a few bucks.",
            "Personally, I would show up and perform.  If my name is on the promotions then I am showing up to show out.  It is my reputation at this point.  If you don't show, the promoter and all the others there can spin their own version of why you didn't show to the crowd.  Show up, get paid in a month and set up written contracts for any more gigs.  Keep everything 100% above board.",
            "Yeah sure, you could abandon your responsibility, your other options were / are not take on a job from an unreliable payer or make them very aware that due to previous trouble with being paid on\nTime you\u2019d like to take this time to remind them that 50% payment is required up front otherwise you won\u2019t be attending.\n\nIf you decide to go the route of not showing up, either with or without making contact first, I\u2019d explain to any followers on social media and apologise that you won\u2019t be performing due to complications outside of your control - in advance and point them to the organiser for refunds if applicable.",
            "Money talks. Period.",
            "Also, you should reach out earlier instead of waiting until it's last minute.  This doesn't mean you are in the wrong, just there are things you can also do to set yourself up better.  Take this as a learning experience!  Write down your terms, payment, scope of work, both sign it, shake hands and have a blast!  Follow-up on any issues 2 weeks before and let them know consequences, etc...  Lastly, if this doesn't work, come to my backyard party and DJ for free to really give it to him!"

Even though some of them have a great catalogue (ZipDJ for me was really good) it\u2019s difficult to navigate and find shit you actually want.\n\nThe way I collect music is by watching YouTube showcase channels for genres I like, Aero and Selected for house, Deeprot and UKF for more bassy stuff like DnB, Bass house, UKG, Speed Garage.  And when I hear something I like, I either buy it, or follow the links from those videos to get a free mp3 or wav download.\n\nI do some mobile/open format stuff, mostly for kids parties/Birthdays/ christenings etc, which I have a small collection for, but use Tidal to fill the gaps.\n\nI think record pools suffer from the \u201ctoo much choice\u201d issue, there\u2019s so much on them, that you kind of get blinded by options.  I prefer to find individual tracks I genuinely like and want to play, and buy them on their own.\n\nIt does cost more this way obviously, but my collection isn\u2019t full of shit I downloaded on a whim that I\u2019ll never play.\n\nI\u2019ve made the mistake of buying an entire record labels USB before with 300+ tracks on it, a lot of them were ok, but only a dozen or so I play regularly, and combing through the collection and archiving/sorting it all was a pain in the ass.\n\nIMO you should build your library slowly and deliberately rather than looking for bulk.\n\nThere are pros and cons to both ways though",
