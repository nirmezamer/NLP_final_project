            "I just ran a 48:55 10k today after 12 weeks back properly training again. Was not terribly unfit beforehand and have previous running experience but had taken a few months off, so I was pretty rusty for my (22M) age.\n\nI am running the Melbourne half marathon in October which is exactly 16 weeks away. According to VDOT calc, the 10k time puts me at ~1:49 for a half. What's a reasonable goal to set for the half marathon if I start a 16 week plan now? \n\nBackground - I peaked at 75-80km a week in the past month but would probably start the half plan at 55-60 and slowly build up to 80 or 90km. I run 6 days a week, long run Sunday ~20k, 1 tempo/threshold, 1 intervals a week, all other days easy with Monday off. \n\nIs sub 1:40 in 16 weeks a realistic goal? Could I even do better, or is this too fast? Not too sure what I should be aiming for",
            "training for my third half marathon in the fall, in drastically different life circumstances than when i ran two in my twenties with a pb of 1:37. \n\n1. i\u2019m now a mailman, and putting in around 100km of walking per week for work. it is mostly low exertion, zone one hr type baseline. is it worth logging any of this mileage in detail (beyond a daily step count)? i\u2019m trying to go a little more structured and data driven this time around to train. \n2. given the daily mileage, which run of the week would you say is least important, as i want to aim for no more than 4 runs per week: tempo/near race pace runs, speed work and interval runs, easy plain runs, or day after long run recovery jogs?",
            "How is Huawei Health calculating the numbers, specifically VO2 max? The numbers seem to be way off on today's run, considering how out of shape I am (42m, 75 kg, 183 cm). It has been 9 months today since my last run. Does 75 meters of elevation difference really bring the VO2 max number up for that much?\n\nLast year's run data: distance: 5,17 km, pace: 5'42\", kcal: 377, average bpm: 176, 20 m elevation gain, VO2 max 36.  \nToday's run: distance: 5,48 km, pace: 6'14\", kcal 450, average bpm: 167, 75 m elevation gain, VO2 max 47.",
            "I find that on my tempo runs I have to work hard but I feel good, but that as soon as I move into the cooldown my body just wants to stop. I still do a km or two to wind down, but is this normal? Am I overdoing my tempo runs?",
            "Hi  \nI've been running properly for about 6 months, mostly targeting 5km.  My PB is 18:45 and I'm looking to get down to sub 18.  When I'm at the track doing intervals, I can fairly comfortably handle intervals at a pace of 3:10 or even 3:00 per km for up to 800m (sets are usually something like 500, 400, 300 x 4 or 800 x 6 or similar).  However, when I'm doing 5km, this pace totally eludes me - I'm starting at around 3:40 per km and then absolutely dying in the 5th km, going down to 4 min pace with HR closing in on 200.  What training should I be doing to improve this longer distance speed?  I'm finding my current position very frustrating!  \nThanks very much everyone!",
            "How far should my long run tomorrow be?\n\n  \nSo 4 weeks ago I did a Half Marathon (uphill in the heat) in a great time (1:40).\n\nI had quite a few niggles after so took 2 weeks off.\n\n2 weeks ago I did 3 x 10k races in a 2 day weekend - no problem and had fun.\n\nLast weekend I had Covid so couldnt do much.\n\nFor 2 weeks now I've been doing a 3 mile and a 5 mile run mid-week. Did a parkrun today too.\n\nI just realized my marathon training plan kicks off this weekend and demands 13 miles tomorrow. Am I going to injure myself doing that or should I still be ok from what I have been doing if I take it slow? I've thought about doing 10 mile instead of 13 but will be a bit behind the pace...",
            "I just went back to the gym, and would like to train 2-3 times a week a strength routine that is geared a bit towards runners, especially for injury prevention. Anyone knows a good programm or can point me towards an online coach who could help?",
            "I'm training for my second marathon in October and I've set my goal pace to 10min/mile. I ran 6 miles at that pace today and I would describe is as comfortably uncomfortable, mainly because of the heat and humidity. Accounting for the lower temps in fall, do I have room to make my goal pace slightly quicker? \n\nI feel like if I were to run this pace at 50F instead of 80 it would be very close to feeling easy. For reference my usual pace on easy runs falls somewhere around 10:50-11min/mile.",
            "Hi!\nI\u2019ve spent entirely too much time reading about and researching shoes and would love some advice from your experience because there are so many options out there.\n\nI\u2019m currently wearing Brooks Glycerin 21 as my daily trainer and want to incorporate an additional (perhaps lighter) trainer to my rotation so I\u2019m not just running on the same shoes everyday. For some reference, Im female, run between 3-6 miles on most runs, run almost daily, and am currently in 8-10mi long run territory, training for a half marathon. \nI\u2019m wondering for those of you who may also be running in Brooks Glycerin 21s, what other shoes you have in your rotation?! I have been to a few stores and that\u2019s what initially led to my discovery of the Glycerin 21!\n\nI\u2019m currently looking at other styles of Brooks (Ghosts) as well as Saucony (Triumphs) and would really love to hear what you\u2019re running in (and why). \n\nI am looking at Saucony Endorphin Speed as a potential third shoe for speed work and races - not sure if these can stand up as a regular daily? \nThank you so so much!!",

However, the most important think is to recognize the signs of [heat exhaustion](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#exhaustion) and [heat stroke](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#stroke) and not to try to be tough.  If you're running alone and you push into heat exhaustion, you have to stop immediately before you hit heat stroke.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion:\n\n* Confusion\n* Dizziness (good indictor no matter what, but more so when it's summer)\n* Fatigue (more so than usual)\n* Headache\n* Muscle/abdominal cramps\n* Nausea/vomiting\n* Pale skin\n* Profuse sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nHeat stroke is what heat exhaustion will turn into if you don't recognize it and stop immediately.  Signs of heat stroke are fairly similar but one notable difference is **that you have stopped sweating**.  Heat stroke is a serious medical condition and requires emergency treatment.  Call 911!\n\nSymptoms of heat stroke include:\n\n* Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech\n* Loss of consciousness (coma)\n* Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating\n* Seizures\n* Very high body temperature\n* Fatal if treatment delayed\n\nRemember that SLOW DOWN is never the wrong answer in the heat.  You're going to go slower - it's just a fact.  Embrace it and the fitness will still be there when the weather cools off.\n\nSome quick high level tips:\n\n* Run slower (duh)\n* Don't run during the heat of the day\n* Run in shaded areas.   Running in direct sunlight in the summer can add 20+ degrees to your skin temp, and that's what counts, not the air temp.\n* Avoid highly urbanized areas if at all possible during hot days.  The concrete jungle retains and radiates heat back at you, it is almost essentially an oven effect.\n* Focus on humidity as much as the temperature.  Understand how the mechanism of sweat works.  If the humidity is extremely high, sweat will just drip off you and not evaporate.  Evaporation of sweat is the mechanism of how the body cools itself - the phase change from liquid to vapor extracts heat from your skin.\n\nAnother good tip from a helpful Runnitor:\n\n>Dew point is actually a better measure of humidity than humidity percentage points are. That's because air at 100% humidity and 50F holds less water than air at 50% humidity and 90F.\n\n> You can use a dew point calculator to figure out the dew point. Over 65F dew point is sticky, but over 70F is very humid. Make sure to hydrate often and to pay attention to your body to see if it's overheating.\n\n> Here's a good dew point calculator:\n\n> http://dpcalc.org/\n\nFinally, one good table for pace adjustment is here:  http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html?m=1\n\n**As a way to keep things a bit more organized and easier to find info later, I'm going to make several top level comments.  Please respond to those instead of the main post.  All other top level comments will be removed without notice.  I'll include a stickied comment with direct links to each of the topic headings.**",

        "content": "Hey there!\n\nInspired by this community and some posters talking about how great it is to belong to a running club, I'm starting one in my city! There aren't many here, normally just formal paid training groups (San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica), so I think it would be great for many reasons, like creating a running community, getting to know other runners, and providing a safe space for runners as the city isn't as runner-friendly as others. We are starting as a small group of friends who like to run and hopefully others will join in the next few months.\n\nI would like to know what I should take into consideration while doing this, as many of you have already experienced what it's like to belong to one. Could you perhaps share some pointers on what to do or not to do, tips, etc.?\n\nWhat are some characteristics of the best running groups you've belonged to?",

            "The main thing for me is making sure you\u2019re clear about what paces are accommodated and making sure everyone has someone to run with. Don\u2019t say \u201call paces welcome\u201d if everyone runs a 7-8 min/mile and someone who runs slower will be dropped.",
            "When I travel, I go to different run clubs and review my experiences here on Reddit, so I consider myself somewhat of a run club expert.\n\nPersonally, I like to see a variety of routes, a strong and vocal club organizer/leader, and a consistent gathering/hangout spot for before and after the run. Having a strong club organizer that can clearly and loudly communicate to everyone is critical so people know what's going on.  It's common for no one to take charge and direct the group. Lastly, the most enjoyable clubs I've attended either meet at a coffee shop (morning runs) or a restaurant/bar (evening runs) so that people can socialize before and after the activity. Bonus points if the venue offers a free drink.",
            "My time to shine! I started a run club that been going strong for over 12 years, here are my takeaways:\n\nBe consistent. Choose a day of the week and time and always run that day and time, no matter what. It\u2019s winter and snowing, you\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s rainy season and a cyclone in the forecast, you\u2019ll be there. No exceptions.\n\nMake the route intuitive. This can be tricky, especially in urban areas. The route needs to be easy enough your run leader can communicate it to any newcomers and that it\u2019s actually fun to run. This can honestly make or break the first point about being consistent.\n\nThe run leader needs to be vocal about when the run starts and the expectations of how the run ends. Be careful about pre-run group pictures, they can create FOMO which can be a short term gain, but could be a turn off to most. In either case, the run leader can shape this experience.\n\nBe open to the experiences of everyone. Some will run fast, some will enjoy the social hour. Everyone is running and make that the highlight. The best day a runner can have is being there when someone new experiences that joy for the first time.\n\nGood luck and I hope you all can enjoy the gift of wearing the bottom of your shoes off, one mile at a time!",
            "Have someone be First Aid person.",
            "If you're intending to do speed work, rep sessions and the like, measure them by time not distance i.e. 8 x 3 mins rather than 8 x 800m. If you do them on distance then the session is very different for a fast runner vs a slower runner; the faster runners will be standing around waiting for the slower runners to finish, whilst the slower runners feel under pressure to finish the rep and start the next, so that they don't inconvenience the faster runners. The end result is that the slower runners will stop coming to the sessions. By measuring the reps by time and doing them on a closed loop or a short out & back then everyone gets the same session, and perhaps more importantly, everyone is seen to get the same session and everyone can run at their own pace.\n\nWhen I joined my club they used distance, and the slower runners basically didn't attend the speed sessions. When I became chairman I switched it to time not distance, and now have people running together from 3 minutes per km right through to 8 minutes per km, and it works well. It also helps to stop the 'them & us' situation that can occur between fast & slow runners, because they're always together and the faster runners don't simply run away from the slower never to be seen again.",

That\u2019s impossible for me, but plenty of people join and run 45 mins then turn around and run 45 mins back.",
