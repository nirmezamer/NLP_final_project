            "I want to prepare for a half marathon in November, but there will be a roadblock for me in late July as doctor tells me to stop running for 2 weeks after a little surgery. Should I start a running plan in late July, or now? What would you do?",
            "What are the best intervals to do during periods when you don't have a race or event? I often run races of 10k-21k, but I haven\u2019t signed up for any in the coming months. I run about 3 times a week and use 1 training session for interval training.",
            "Went out for a morning run for 2hours and half of that time I got caught in a heavy rainstorm. I have Endorphin Speed 3's that are drenched in water. I took the soles out and tried to pad dry everything as best as I could. Was just wondering if running in heavy rain damages the shoes?",
            "Why would not running before the surgery be better than running before the surgery?",
            "It kind of depends how long you've been running already, but that should still give you plenty of time to get ready. Most half-marathon training plans seem to run for 12 to 18 weeks.",
            "Honestly? Whatever keeps it fun for you and engaged.",
            "Barring any race-specific stuff, I would always go for threshold work. Now there are lot of ways to structure that: 800m or 1 mile reps with a short break, a few 2 or 3 mile reps with a longer break, various configurations of fartlek. I think it's worth switching it up just to help stay focused.",
            "The standard advice is to see a physical therapist to find out what your injury is and the best way to rehab it.",

However, the most important think is to recognize the signs of [heat exhaustion](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#exhaustion) and [heat stroke](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#stroke) and not to try to be tough.  If you're running alone and you push into heat exhaustion, you have to stop immediately before you hit heat stroke.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion:\n\n* Confusion\n* Dizziness (good indictor no matter what, but more so when it's summer)\n* Fatigue (more so than usual)\n* Headache\n* Muscle/abdominal cramps\n* Nausea/vomiting\n* Pale skin\n* Profuse sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nHeat stroke is what heat exhaustion will turn into if you don't recognize it and stop immediately.  Signs of heat stroke are fairly similar but one notable difference is **that you have stopped sweating**.  Heat stroke is a serious medical condition and requires emergency treatment.  Call 911!\n\nSymptoms of heat stroke include:\n\n* Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech\n* Loss of consciousness (coma)\n* Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating\n* Seizures\n* Very high body temperature\n* Fatal if treatment delayed\n\nRemember that SLOW DOWN is never the wrong answer in the heat.  You're going to go slower - it's just a fact.  Embrace it and the fitness will still be there when the weather cools off.\n\nSome quick high level tips:\n\n* Run slower (duh)\n* Don't run during the heat of the day\n* Run in shaded areas.   Running in direct sunlight in the summer can add 20+ degrees to your skin temp, and that's what counts, not the air temp.\n* Avoid highly urbanized areas if at all possible during hot days.  The concrete jungle retains and radiates heat back at you, it is almost essentially an oven effect.\n* Focus on humidity as much as the temperature.  Understand how the mechanism of sweat works.  If the humidity is extremely high, sweat will just drip off you and not evaporate.  Evaporation of sweat is the mechanism of how the body cools itself - the phase change from liquid to vapor extracts heat from your skin.\n\nAnother good tip from a helpful Runnitor:\n\n>Dew point is actually a better measure of humidity than humidity percentage points are. That's because air at 100% humidity and 50F holds less water than air at 50% humidity and 90F.\n\n> You can use a dew point calculator to figure out the dew point. Over 65F dew point is sticky, but over 70F is very humid. Make sure to hydrate often and to pay attention to your body to see if it's overheating.\n\n> Here's a good dew point calculator:\n\n> http://dpcalc.org/\n\nFinally, one good table for pace adjustment is here:  http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html?m=1\n\n**As a way to keep things a bit more organized and easier to find info later, I'm going to make several top level comments.  Please respond to those instead of the main post.  All other top level comments will be removed without notice.  I'll include a stickied comment with direct links to each of the topic headings.**",

            "I ran my first 5k today with no prep runs and managed it in 30 minutes with no walk breaks which was a total surprise. My fitness comes from other areas of my life and I've always had such mental block about running... so pleased to feel like I've knocked through the wall a bit!",
