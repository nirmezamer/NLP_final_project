            "Secretary of State Frank LaRose has published the list in case anyone who\u2019s on it is there in error, as has happened in the past. A state website,\u00a0[https://registrationreadiness.ohiosos.gov/](https://registrationreadiness.ohiosos.gov/), includes a searchable database showing all the registrations. Anyone who\u2019s on it can prevent their registration from getting canceled if, before July 22, they either:\n\n* [Update their voter registration online](https://olvr.ohiosos.gov/)\u00a0or at a county board of elections office\n* Confirm their address at a county BMV or county board of elections office\n* Request an absentee ballot\n* Sign a candidate or issue petition\n\nVoters whose registrations are canceled can re-register at any time. The deadline to register to vote in the upcoming Nov. 5 election falls on Oct. 7.\n\nEDIT: This is the info you need but anyone can access the full article linked in the OP by registering for a free account. **You don't need to enter any payment information for access.**",

            "FYI:  \"Approved by a 62-38 ratio, the amendment repealed election-day and permanent registration, established a 30-day, statewide registration requirement effective in 1978, and required re-registration if a voter failed to vote at least once in a four-year period. For the first time, Ohio had a standard statewide voter registration requirement, effective for the Nov. 7, 1978 election. (prior to this there was no statewide requirement for voters to be registered). As of Jan. 1, 1979, the Ohio secretary of state was required to maintain a master list of registered voters, compiled from the 88 county boards of elections. The state also began allowing registration by mail.\"\n\nLaRose was the first SoS to publish lists of those in danger of being purged.  \n\nI won't vote for any R's in Ohio, but let's have the facts.",
            "I don't know why the message isn't getting across...if you're on the list and you think that's an error you can get that changed through contacting them.....if you don't correct it and are then removed you can reapply to get back on the active list........if you don't respond either way you're just off the list",

            "Just remember if orange man wins and you voted against him you'll be put on a different kind of list",
            "Not that this isn\u2019t complete BS, and obvious for what it is from the pathetic GOP, but I will say this: \n\nIf you are on that list, use this as a wake up call to start voting every two damn years and live up to what I see as your civic freaking duty. How, after everything that has happened since 2016 have all (yes, I am sure there are a few people with reasonable excuses-a FEW!) of you not gotten off your rear ends and VOTED! \n\nAgain, as much as I hate the makeup of our current state government,the GOP\u2026.and this stunt, shame on all of you on that list for being to lazy and apathetic to try to change things in this damn state/country. You gave them the opening, and now your only redemption is to fix it before election time and start freaking voting every two years!!!!!",
