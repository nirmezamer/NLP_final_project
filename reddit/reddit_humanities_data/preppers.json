We aren't likely to go into Mad-Max in the decades ahead and people with tangible money, like silver and gold, will be able to buy the things needed to survive.  It doesn't fit well with the baked beans and bullet crowd or those selling solar systems and knives, but the history of civilization proves that those with money do better than those without.",

        "content": "The truth is preppers/gun enthusiasts will be the bigger threat if SHFT, not government, not looters and possibly not even the disaster itself.\u00a0\n\nLet me explain why:\n\nIn almost all prepping communities I\u2019ve observed, most conversations almost always steer to guns. We rarely discuss training other aspects of our selves.\n\nI\u2019m a former Marine, I was infantry (0352) and worked with law enforcement for nearly 10 years, I\u2019m very familiar with firearms and their use. A mistake my fellow veterans make is thinking natural/manmade disasters will be combat zones. We buy better guns, simulate combat scenarios encourage our civilian buddies to do the same and ultimately behave like a paramilitary.\u00a0\n\nThis is dangerous.\n\nIt implies your fellow countrymen will be the enemy, it sets your mind with a level of mistrust and paranoia thats hard to shake off.\u00a0While I\u2019m sure many preppers are hoarding food and water, what happens when it runs out? What happens if social order breaks down? I can\u2019t remember the last time any of my prepper buddies discussed learning to farm, or how to maintain a small community in the absence of government.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes us dangerous, we hoard guns/ammo and train for combat that may never happen. We don\u2019t train to maintain a peaceful community. We train for hostility, thereby making us more likely to be hostile.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d\n\nIf we\u2019re going survive a SHTF scenario, we must train our bodies, mind and soul. Learn philosophies like Stoicism, learn second order thinking, psychology and techniques to negotiate/barter.\u00a0\n\nIf your mind is strong, you are unstoppable.\n\nIt\u2019s more important than having the best rifle money can buy.\u00a0\n\nUntil then, \u201cKnow thy enemy.\u201d -Sun Tzu",

            "The biggest threat will be starving people who didn't prep.  I agree that skills such as gardening and barter are going to be importance, but that will come after the first couple of months. A garden can't be depended upon if thieves raid it while you are asleep.   Maintaining a constant storing of food through agriculture and barter will require more than any one set of skills.  It will require a community of people to ensure safety and security.  Even the biggest badass has to sleep some time.",

Food security would go a lot further in a real crisis. A sense of community and connections you can rely on would be another important layer. Instead, the prepper mindset all too often steers toward lone wolfing it. \n\nIve had a few bad days where we needed our preps, we needed our friends, and we needed cash reserves. I have yet to need my gun.",

            "If you are prepping to survive 6 months then you need to consider more than just calories. Rice and beans are a great start, but there are a lot of nutrients that our bodies need that you also have to consider. \n\nYou don't actually need to eat every day to survive.

There is good nutrition available, but if you don't pad this with some meat, a lot of spices,maybe a couple of Sam's club bulk value bullion packs, and something to break up the monotony you will stop wanting to eat this diet without variance. You would probably go into shutdown mode if you started out on this without any prepping into it. Any sudden shift in your diet will have catastrophic end results, those cultures that have this as a dietary staple have adapted their systems to it. A western eating person who suddenly shifted to rice and beans with no warning would not be loving life for a couple of weeks as their body adapts to the shift from fast food they're used to. Adding flat bread, meats and other dried vegetables would help reduce the taste boredom, but it still would not be a satisfying diet by itself.",
