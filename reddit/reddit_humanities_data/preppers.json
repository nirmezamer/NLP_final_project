        "content": "The truth is preppers/gun enthusiasts will be the bigger threat if SHFT, not government, not looters and possibly not even the disaster itself.\u00a0\n\nLet me explain why:\n\nIn almost all prepping communities I\u2019ve observed, most conversations almost always steer to guns. We rarely discuss training other aspects of our selves.\n\nI\u2019m a former Marine, I was infantry (0352) and worked with law enforcement for nearly 10 years, I\u2019m very familiar with firearms and their use. A mistake my fellow veterans make is thinking natural/manmade disasters will be combat zones. We buy better guns, simulate combat scenarios encourage our civilian buddies to do the same and ultimately behave like a paramilitary.\u00a0\n\nThis is dangerous.\n\nIt implies your fellow countrymen will be the enemy, it sets your mind with a level of mistrust and paranoia thats hard to shake off.\u00a0While I\u2019m sure many preppers are hoarding food and water, what happens when it runs out? What happens if social order breaks down? I can\u2019t remember the last time any of my prepper buddies discussed learning to farm, or how to maintain a small community in the absence of government.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes us dangerous, we hoard guns/ammo and train for combat that may never happen. We don\u2019t train to maintain a peaceful community. We train for hostility, thereby making us more likely to be hostile.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d\n\nIf we\u2019re going survive a SHTF scenario, we must train our bodies, mind and soul. Learn philosophies like Stoicism, learn second order thinking, psychology and techniques to negotiate/barter.\u00a0\n\nIf your mind is strong, you are unstoppable.\n\nIt\u2019s more important than having the best rifle money can buy.\u00a0\n\nUntil then, \u201cKnow thy enemy.\u201d -Sun Tzu",

            "I think firearms can also be an easy bandaid.  You take the classes, buy the things, practice, and boom, done.  Can do all that in a matter of a month or two.\n\nGetting to know your neighbors, learning to grow anything in your microclimate (year after year), seed saving, preserving, building a root cellar, etc, all take time and commitment and effort.  This takes years.  Years.  \nYou're not going to know that you cannot for the life of you keep a peach tree alive in your yard because of the frosts, or how evil cling peaches can be, or that canned apple pie filling is kinda gross, until after you've done all that.",
            "Yep. There\u2019s ALOT of angry people out there now, wait until they haven\u2019t eaten in 3 days.",
            "IMHO\n\nStreet gangs, cartels and criminal organizations will be a big threat.\n\n\nThey're already organized, armed, have their own set of rules and know how to work outside the system.",
            "I don't think it is so much the gun enthusiasts who are the biggest potential threat, it is those who are like that and don't bother doing much of anything else since they have the mentality of \"I can shoot someone else for what I need\". As a fellow vet, I also run with a couple local circles of people who are gun enthusiasts, but are very community based and upstanding individuals. The people who don't prep, have some weaponry, and fall upon hard times, they'll either resolve the problem selves by suck-starting their weapon of choice, or they *will* lose a battle with someone else. Each time, it's a roll of the dice, and the odds are never in favor of the lone wolf.\n\nIt's why community is so important. Even a street with dozen houses with 3-4 dozen people on it can be really strong, with people doing different tasks (from gardening, water purification, 'field doctors', engineers to simplify and maintain things, to a group for patrols/night watch). Trying to do everything there is without a community is impossible, and a quick way to lead to a slow death. People have always clumped together for the survival of the group. People who don't, at the very least, tend to have a hard time growing their family tree.\n\nAnd really, even if large-scale government breaks down, even that won't be the end of the world. Streets, neighborhoods, boroughs, and towns will rise back up, work with other streets, neighborhoods, boroughs, and towns for mutual protection, partnership, and trade of goods, and eventually that can get larger to the point where ordered counties are reestablished, then states. It's the natural way humanity has *always* operated. This mentality some people have of \"every neighbor will be at war with one another, so I'll just hunker down in my house or hide in the mountains for the rest of my life\" is delusional and self-destructive. Things'll be different, sure. Harder, absolutely. But, each and every time something has come along and shattered a nation, another rises up, and in modern times, it happens fairly quickly.\n\nLet's just hope that whatever happens that is strong enough to bring this nation down, we can learn from it and improve for the next iteration. It's also why order and even a basic justice system would be one of the first things needed, since there's no point in suffering people who just want to make it harder on everyone else",
            "I\u2019ll have to respectfully disagree. \n\nThe vast majority of preppers I have interacted with are thoughtful, pragmatic people that don\u2019t like feeling unprepared when facing uncertainty. \n\nMost just want to be self sufficient. Maybe they have others who depend on them, or they\u2019ve seen what can happen when you\u2019re unprepared. \n\nI\u2019ve seen plenty of topics around here and other places discussing how best to rebuild different aspects of live after a disaster. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, it could just be that your group of friends enjoys larping and discussing tactical scenarios over what plants will provide the most food energy, and both are fine. We will need both!",
            "you did notice that you are talking about the USA specifically. not preppers generally.\nthe USA is a country with a very strong gun culture and a history of relying on guns over government. ( and a government that relies heavily on its guns and bombs for foreign and domestic affairs) that has been true for the last 200 years and i expect nothing to change in the next 200..\n\ni remember a few years back a story of a ex-Leo visiting calgary canada, he was at the park with his wife and someone who (he thought)looked like a shitbag walked by and said hello, and kept walking. but this ex-leo had never felt so vulnerable in his life since he did not have his ECD pistol in canada.   \n( an entire country that likely has less crime then most any one state in the USA)\n  \nimage being so fearful of the world that someone can put the fear of god into you with dirty clothes and a hello. or feeling so inadequate that you feel in danger without a gun near at hand at all times?    \n  \nthe famous quote is that.\nGod made man, sam colt make them equal.  \n \nand that is not true,     \nsam colt gave power to those who could not empower themselves with hard work and dedication to improvement.   \n  \nand those weak fearful people will grab as many guns as they can and call it self sufficiency.\n( i will wait for downvotes, and yes i own 35+ firearms and i have not touched one in 3 weeks)",
            "Idk. Personally I've been following this group for a couple of years. And yeah there's a percentage of lone wolves who think it's going to be them against the world ,l(I could make generalizations about such folks, but I digress). For each of those, I've also seen first responders like myself who have implored members to seek first aid training (Stop the bleed, Wilderness first aid, etc). And I have definitely seen a share of farming posts. I have seen suggestion threads with people seeking advice for YouTube or Podcasts related to first aid or farming.\n\nDon't get me wrong. You get a lot of the same old stale questions about firearms and ammunition and water purification. It tends to be cyclical, but I believe it's usually just new people joining the group and having not been around to see the other posts. \n\nIt is refreshing to see somebody posting about this again so that hopefully that said new group of people can see this and be enlightened as the rest of us have. \n\nThen there is the discussion of what level of ShTF are folks expecting. Just a natural disaster waiting for aid and services to return or is it EROL or TEOTWAWKI.\n\nCuz I mean stocking supplies for a couple of months is well off for you if you end up losing services for a month after a natural disaster. If it's TEOTWAWKI then yeah, better know how to farm.",

            "Hard disagree. The conversations steer towards guns because guns are *cool* and drying seeds for long-term storage is **boring**.\n\nPeople are so terminally online that they're confusing gun people for preppers. I spend a good deal of my online time discussing guns; I spend way more real-life time and money on food storage and gardening than I do on guns. There's comms nerds that are just like the gun fetishists and nobody on this sub is calling them out. Let people enjoy things.\u2122\n\nAlso, nobody in government is trying to take my canned tuna away... yet.\n\nGuns are just more fun and interesting than the intricacies of post-SHTF community organizing. People will still organize. You're not going to get bubba to read *Meditations*, but he'll talk about reloading for his 1911 all day. The gun guy that sits on his mountaintop waiting to be raided will simply be ignored.",
