        "content": "Hello Hello,\n\nJust looking for some help or tips from fellow industry people about professional cook level 1 exam. I've been working in the kitchen for 3 years now at the same place. You know how everything becomes less challenging when you work in the same kitchen 5 days a week for 10-12 hours!\n\nI haven't done culinary school, just dived right in. and its been good so far, learnt a lot of things.\n\nI am planning on challenging professional cook level 1 exam next month. But have absolutely zero clue where to start studying!!!!!!\n\nAs I mentioned, I have no schooling in cooking but am a good learner and learnt to work on all stations and prep in my restaurant within a year and a half!\n\nAny help would be much much appreciated. Any books, websites, anything is appreciated.\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, how does the whole thing works? I know there's a written exam and a practical. But things like what kind of questions are there in written exam, how many questions, etc. any help pls!!",

            "I pinned the post cause i know how these exams can be and its best to try and get answers from someone who's been through it. You might wanna include your country or state if your in the U.S. so people can help you best. \n\nIn my experience exams like these are usually vocab test. Theyll ask you to explain or demonstrate what this term means and you'll do it.  Next there gonna test you on base skills of cooking. Can you flip, can you cook something without burning, knife skills ect.  They will also ask you history question on the industry. Make sure you know your key players. \n\nTry and see if you have a rubric on what youll be graded on. Thats the best way to prepare. \n\n  \nGOOD LUCK!!!",
            "Hey i just passed the level 1 exam with a 94/100. I think i spent about 15 minutes on it, but I've always been a very fast test taker. Most of the questions are honestly common sense for anybody who has a good amount of professional AND/OR amateur cooking experience. If you are confident in whipping something up from scratch, then I think you will pass without studying.\n\nThat said, I did study a bit and what i studied were mother sauces and their deriatives and stocks. These were not intuitive to me as i have been vegan for almost half my life. I have a ton of sample questions/answers that are almost verbatim to the test. If you would like me to send you anything, lmk.\n\nAlso this is just general advice for multi choice tests, but I will say it in case you don't know: NEVER dwell on a question you don't know. Skip it and come back to it later. Sometimes other questions will even have answers for previous questions!\n\nEDIT: just reread your post and noted you did not go to culinary school at all, this test is VERY by the book. It's also gonna focus on french cooking. As well as terms that may or may not matter in most restaurants. Do you know what a capon is for example.",

Wife and I look at each other with the WTF are we doing here look. It was a really rough night as they don\u2019t drink either, I felt really bad for the servers that had to try and accommodate them with what they could muster from the kitchen. To cap off the night they said what they ate wasn\u2019t very tasty or good !

Last time I went to Morton\u2019s I had a huge baked potato with saut\u00e9ed onions and veg ( I was going to skip cuz butter but the server insisted they would use oil) minced garlic, I can\u2019t even remember all the veg sides they brought out (in oil again) salad with balsamic, I was stuffed. \n\nA lot of vegans only look for items listed as vegan options instead of ordering sides and using their brains. It helps of course that half our party were regulars and huge tippers, but I can find something decent to eat everywhere. Managing expectations is key, vegans have to be more excited about visiting with friends than what any restaurant will create for them. Sorry you had such a bummer night at such a great place.",

I just switched up the menu and it calls for the mandolin a lot. The fucking guys will leave the blade 'open', like not wind the mandolin closed, so the blade sits proud on the sliding/ramp surface, and plop it in the tank.
