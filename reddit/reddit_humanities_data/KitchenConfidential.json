        "content": "Hello Hello,\n\nJust looking for some help or tips from fellow industry people about professional cook level 1 exam. I've been working in the kitchen for 3 years now at the same place. You know how everything becomes less challenging when you work in the same kitchen 5 days a week for 10-12 hours!\n\nI haven't done culinary school, just dived right in. and its been good so far, learnt a lot of things.\n\nI am planning on challenging professional cook level 1 exam next month. But have absolutely zero clue where to start studying!!!!!!\n\nAs I mentioned, I have no schooling in cooking but am a good learner and learnt to work on all stations and prep in my restaurant within a year and a half!\n\nAny help would be much much appreciated. Any books, websites, anything is appreciated.\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, how does the whole thing works? I know there's a written exam and a practical. But things like what kind of questions are there in written exam, how many questions, etc. any help pls!!",

            "Hey i just passed the level 1 exam with a 94/100. I think i spent about 15 minutes on it, but I've always been a very fast test taker. Most of the questions are honestly common sense for anybody who has a good amount of professional AND/OR amateur cooking experience. If you are confident in whipping something up from scratch, then I think you will pass without studying.\n\nThat said, I did study a bit and what i studied were mother sauces and their deriatives and stocks. These were not intuitive to me as i have been vegan for almost half my life. I have a ton of sample questions/answers that are almost verbatim to the test. If you would like me to send you anything, lmk.\n\nAlso this is just general advice for multi choice tests, but I will say it in case you don't know: NEVER dwell on a question you don't know. Skip it and come back to it later. Sometimes other questions will even have answers for previous questions!\n\nEDIT: just reread your post and noted you did not go to culinary school at all, this test is VERY by the book. It's also gonna focus on french cooking. As well as terms that may or may not matter in most restaurants. Do you know what a capon is for example.",
            "I pinned the post cause i know how these exams can be and its best to try and get answers from someone who's been through it. You might wanna include your country or state if your in the U.S. so people can help you best. \n\nIn my experience exams like these are usually vocab test. Theyll ask you to explain or demonstrate what this term means and you'll do it.  Next there gonna test you on base skills of cooking. Can you flip, can you cook something without burning, knife skills ect.  They will also ask you history question on the industry. Make sure you know your key players. \n\nTry and see if you have a rubric on what youll be graded on. Thats the best way to prepare. \n\n  \nGOOD LUCK!!!",
            "I suspect from the title that OP is in British Columbia Canada :). And that the exam they are asking about is this one:https://skilledtradesbc.ca/professional-cook-1\n\nAnd also, for the OP:https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-01/professional-cook-1-program-outline-july-2020.pdf\n\nThe assessment criteria is on page 96 or 98, depending on your browser/phone :)."

        "content": "For context, my wife and I opened our place 2 years ago and today was our 2 year anniversary for the business. We had a perfect score of 5.0 on google with 124 reviews. Its not much but its honest work I guess. We are both bummed out by this review, its like a stain or crappy way to start our 3rd year. So here\u2019s a summary. We are a small bistro with 2 sit down tables and 5 more high tables with highstool chairs. This couple walks in, orders 2 coffee and then setup a laptop and start working. They have zoom meetings and meanwhile around them people are eating. I have a take-out section with fridges and it gets noisy, so no one is bothered by the chit chat. The man leaves for approximately 1 hour and then comes back with a packaged sandwich. While he\u2019s gone, the lady continues her calls and at some points asks my barista if she can \u201cturn down\u201d my noisy fridges. I don\u2019t blame my employee for answering with a confused face that we simply could not\u2026\n\nI\u2019m the chef and I work the kitchen. I had my mom (la nonna) in the kitchen and she was eyeing that lady all this time lol. When the lady took out strawberries and started snacking, nonna went out the kitchen with her hands on her hips and just stared. I don\u2019t condone and even scolded my mom (although the scene was comical) and knew immediately things weren\u2019t going well. I told everyone to back off and let it go, lunch hour was over and the place was emptying anyways. \n\nBut when the husband came back with a sandwich from another establishment and he started eating it\u2026 my wife (who\u2019s very timid and it took her all her courage) told the couple that other families had waited for that table and to see them eat food from another establishment is\u2026 something you don\u2019t do. They said they had bought coffee (2 hours ago) and that they don\u2019t see the problem. At this point my wife just smiled and wished them a good day and went back to serving other customers. We let them eat their things but they decided to pack up and leave. They wrote the review within the hour (:\n\nWhat cracked me up, was the rating on the food. 3/5 ? Please go tell the maker of that sandwich lol\nIs this even worthy of an answer? Its not going to change our score. We have yet to turn a profit or claim a salary, so we are just bummed out. Thanks for reading guys. After tomorrow\u2019s lunch we will be opening a prosecco bottle.\n",
