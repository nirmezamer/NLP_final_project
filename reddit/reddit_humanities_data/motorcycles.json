            "Not saying the rider is at fault, but I lane split a lot (Ca commuter) and if I were approaching a car stopped like that with a large gap in front of them my spidey senses would have lit up like a Christmas tree. I'd have hauled the speed down and gone by @ no more than 5 mph.",

I've been in that situation where a stranger parked so close I couldn't lean my bike upright to get out and barely got the kickstand up. My bike weighs 900pds. I scraped the hell out of that back bumper on the way out. Wish I had of done more damage.",
            "I would have had to use there bonnet as a surface to stand on to get onto my bike. However I NEVER park my bike like that I\u2019d usually park on the pavement or  find a spot that cars can\u2019t access because car drivers NEVER use their rear vision mirror and eventually your bike will get reversed into. The One time I parked like that I was busting for a piss and  when I got back someone had backed into my Ducati. Knocking it over I couldn\u2019t believe it. . The guy was like \u201chey it looks fine hers my number\u201d   cost his insurer 4K. lol. . btw never yet had a ticket for parking on pavement out of the way as long as your not a dick about it. .",
