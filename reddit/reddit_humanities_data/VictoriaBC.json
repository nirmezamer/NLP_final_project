I wanted to update you all and let you guys know that I called the non-emergancy line and let them know everything that I know about my upstairs neighbours, a cop came by and took down all three serial #\u2019s for the bikes and he checked his system but didn\u2019t tell me if they were reported stolen. The theif walked passed me and the cop so I said to the cop \u201cthat\u2019s him, I got told by my other neighbour that he has warrents out for his arrest.\u201d The cop just nodded to that. But I found out more about the guy, I have his name but I am going to leave it out for security reasons. I found out he has three little girls who got taken away by CPS and he doesn\u2019t pay child support or visit them, two of the three girls got adopted which is amazing. I am not sure what happend to the other girl though. I did tell thw cop about my first post and I showed it to him and he said it was a good idea to do it so people are aware of these things happening escpecialy keeping their names out of it as well. Both the guy and his gf are supposedly herion addicts but not confirmed. Please let this post be a great idea for everyone to report missing/stolen bikes or other things ASAP and get a security cam or a doorbell with a camera so it can help the cops!\n\nEdit to add: Everyone in my co-op alreadys knows about his children and his file with the cops, I didn\u2019t tell the cop till after he left the co-op with his dog so he didn\u2019t hear me at all! If he wants to humiliate me publicly he can go ahead IDGAF. I haven been through some not so good things in my life and Im st the point where I do not care at all, I have nothing to hide. Also Victoria is a decent sized place not small.",
