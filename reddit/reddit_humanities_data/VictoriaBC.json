            "I'm 2 blocks from the supportive housing for young adults building on Meares near Cook. 48 units for 19-27 years old. It's operated by Beacon Services through BC Housing and opened October 2023. Some pearl clutchers in my building started a Block Watch prior to the opening fearing the worst. I've noticed zero difference in the area since. EDIT. Should clarify, I've noticed zero negative impact from supportive housing.",
            "Great news! 56 people in Victoria get housing security. I can't imagine the feeling these people would get from that",
            "\u201cHaving a safe place to lay your head at night is something everyone deserves, and we know that when people have stable housing with supports they can start to rebuild their lives and enjoy contributing to the community,\u201d Ravi Kahlon, minister of housing said in a news release.\n\nHe's correct. These rooms mean that 56 more people each night can have a place to sleep, to recover, and to start rebuilding. Those of us who have always had that don't truly understand how important and valuable that is. I'm glad this is happening. I only wish there was a way to safely provide this sort of service to all who are currently without a place to stay.\n\n\"Cool Aid Society will operate the building and will provide 24/7 staffing, meal programs, life skills training, employment assistance, health care referrals and wellness support, and connection and referral to community services and support groups.\"\n\nGood, leave it with the people who know how to provide these services. I particularly like the idea of life-skills training being an inherent part of the building. I'm a big education guy, so seeing this here, as well as similar services at that new proposed building for those just leaving the prison system... I like where this is all heading. I just want more, please.",
            "I put my name in for it, seriously hoping and praying I can get in, I\u2019ll take anything. Tired asf of being in a homeless shelter.",
            "I understand something needs to be done, and we desperately need more housing. But for this project the province spent $345,000 per person, just in construction cost alone. Not including support services and building maintenance going forward.\n\nIn terms of cost per individual helped, these kinds of housing projects must be one of the least efficient programs the province has to offer. \n\nI honestly don't know what the answer is, and I'm not even necessarily against this project or ones like it, but... Damn that's a lot of money for only 56 people benefitting from it. You could have given $10,000 to every single homeless person in Victoria for the cost of just this building.",
            "I lived beside supportive housing for years that was reserved for those with substance use issues, mental health crises or who had experienced homelessness. Never had a single issue, aside from my cat doing daily stare downs with the cats in their building.\n\nThe neighbours in my building were worse.",
            "No surprises. Housing first works. It ain't perfect but it's the best we got.",
            "Ty for posting this. We never hear this side of the story so the narrative continues about supportive housing brings crime and unsafe conditions",
            ">\u00a0I've noticed zero difference in the area since.\n\nSounds like you owe the block watch a thank you!",
            "I got an opportunity to tour the building the other day. It's well designed and set up, units have crazy high ceilings and are quite nice. Definitely a huge step up from a sidewalk."

Yet somehow, when it's housing investments, people feel so entitled that it should be a guarantee. \nYou took a risk, you lost, move on. Government should not compensate for these losses. When it comes to a public good, its hard for many to sympathize with this, when we know someone else's profits are coming directly at our own expense.\n\n*And renters aren't being compensated for skyrocketing rents, thanks to businesses operating in a fashion that increases pressure on the housing supply (*ie: degree mills, Air B&B, Canada's current immigration exploitation industry).",
