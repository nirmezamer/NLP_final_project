            "Please pray for me and my friends success in our upcoming exam.\n\nIt is the most important one of our life so far. May God stay by our side throughout this whole exam week, help us, and may we all pass it, with the highest  distinctions. \n\nAmen \n\nThank you !",

            "Praying that I find a spiritual director for vocational formation who is the right fit. I'm looking for someone who is rather experienced in contemplative prayer, and those are apparently few.",
            "For the salvation and final perseverance of me and my loved ones\n\n\nFor the health of my girlfriend's dog\n\n\n\u00a0For reparation for offenses committed against the Sacred Heart and Immaculate Heart.\n\n\nFor my next Confession to go well.\n\n\nFor me to trust Christ through my scrupulosity and receive Communion.\n\n\nFor the mental health of a loved one to improve.\n\n\nFor peace in the world and mitigation of any potential chastisements.\n\n\nFor a loved one's meeting with a therapist to go well.\n\n\nFor my uncle with throat cancer to get medical treatment and for him to turn back to God.",
            "Hi.\n\nI would appreciate your prayers towards me. I still don't have good days.\n\nI'm still struggling at my job (yesterday I was expecting a salary increase and I won't have it. Things where I live are getting more expensive as time goes by); I feel unsupported in a country where I know no one and where it is difficult to form a Catholic community. I feel my professional knowledge is useless. I want to move to another country and company, but the current job market is very complicated and I feel I can't fit in any current position they offer (again: I feel my knowledge is useless and I'm afraid of falling in the same hole where I'm currently).\n\nI feel alone...",
            "Hey,\nA small request but I have a driving test on Wednesday (Australia). I failed the first time and I\u2019m a bit nervous and scared. Could you please pray for me to be calm and be strong, and pass this test.\nThank you and God bless you all",
            "For my wife and me as we try to grow our family and improve our health.\n\nFor me as interview with several companies for jobs this week.",
            "For the victims of the shooting at a local splash pad this weekend, and for the soul of the shooter.",
            "Pray for me as I continue to feel the Lord's calling and that I may be guided to continue my discernment and vocation to the priesthood. Pray for me that anything which can distract me from my vocation will be removed in my life.\n\nPray for my purity and a chaste heart.\n\nJoin me also as I pray for the conversion of all sinners, those who have left the Church, and those who do not believe in the Catholic faith."

He looked busy and tired. He could've overlooked the student(s) entirely. I can't imagine being in his position, especially knowing how everything he says is taken out of context by one party or another; scrutinized and over-analyzed for insidious latent meanings. He's also in his mid-to-late eighties, with one lung, and a bad knee that leaves him wheel-chair bound in public. Let's pray for him. The forces he has to fight are much stronger than for us.",

            "Asking for divorce and choosing to wear a rainbow sash kinda tips off that this is about more than the Pope\u2019s use of a word. I 100% agree that we should avoid the use of slurs, which, when uttered by the Faithful, act as a stumbling block which pushes people away from conversion. Asking for the same, plus asking for divorce, plus wearing a rainbow sash in an audience with the Pope? Come on. That reeks of a higher agenda.",
            "Progressive media and RadTrads agree that they find Pope Francis\u2019 language \u2018confusing\u2019, but for widely different reasons. It\u2019s a bit comical. The former feels betrayed because he isn\u2019t the reformer they wanted, but holds to the Church\u2019s stance, and the latter, because he hasn\u2019t declared another Inquisition lol\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/world/europe/pope-slur-church-lgbtq.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/world/europe/pope-slur-church-lgbtq.html)"

I mean, my interest is because I believe the historical evidence points to the catholic church, not because of some personal feelings or because I\u2019m magically \u201cborn again\u201d like some street preachers talk about. I came to a new understanding of history that matters a lot.",

            "Your therapist\u2019s comment reflects a misunderstanding that is unfortunately quite pervasive in the broader culture. The Catholic church isn\u2019t concerned with promoting guilt per se. Catholic faith, however, IS centered on belief in a God who is \u201cpersonal\u201d (actually the 3 Divine Persons of the Trinity united in perfect love) so not merely a conception of some ultimate but impersonal sort of goodness or \u201chigher power.\u201d (Buddhism, for example, is not centered on a personal deity.) Consequently, Judaism, most forms of Christianity, and Islam\u2014as the 3 major world religions that claim the ancient Hebrew leader Abraham as a key figure\u2014all emphasize each individual\u2019s accountability to God-as-Person. \u201cAccountability\u201d doesn\u2019t equate to \u201cguilt.\u201d It\u2019s a way of recognizing the special dignity we enjoy as beings who can choose (or refuse) to reflect God\u2019s own perfect goodness and love.",
            "As someone who had years of therapy, along with at least one terrible therapist, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for your therapist to express their opinion of your religious beliefs.\n\nIs your therapist Catholic? Have they studied the faith extensively? On what grounds is it guilt focused? Confession?\n\nI am reminded of a recent comment Jordan Peterson made -\u201cpsychotherapy is secularized confession and atonement\u201d.",
            "I had a similar issue with my therapist. He was atheist, which for me would have been fine, but he\u2019d throw in abrasive jabs that made me realize that he didn\u2019t understand my faith. When we talked about important struggles, I\u2019d approach it with a faith perspective, and he\u2019d often ask me to not do that, but approach it normally. I tried explaining that my faith isn\u2019t compartmentalized, and that everything in my life has something to do with my faith, and he didn\u2019t agree. I once mentioned God when we were talking about unconditional love, and he disagreed and said it sounds like I have to do a lot to earn Gods love. This was through Catholic Charities. He was bad in other ways though.\u00a0",
            "I\u2019d change therapist. She\u2019s crossed the line. Happened to me too. She encouraged me to have pre-marital sex with my girlfriend \ud83d\udc80",
            "I mean we don\u2019t know the context either. If you are already becoming overly focused on the rules and feeling constant anxiety and guilt over not doing things just right, than she might have a point. I\u2019ve noticed for some personalities, getting too invested in all the Catholic stuff, at least from the Roman rite angle can foster a lot of anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Otherwise idk.",
            "Ask her what she means.",
            "Is it that YOU tend to have overly strong feelings of guilt and you have said that guilt is something that is important in the Catholic Church that attracts you to it? Or is it that HE believes the Catholic Church is fixated on guilt?",
            "That is so inappropriate. My wife is a therapist, she would never comment on her client's personal religious views/faith.\u00a0",
            "Catholic theology next to Protestant theology gets the characteristic of being \"guilt focused\". That's more due to \"faith alone\" theology underscores the consequences of sin. Catholics are more upfront about it.\n\nHowever the whole \"Catholic guilt\" thing is more a meme than anything. There's recognition but the focus on Jesus mercy overshadows it.\n\nEdit: If you decide to go through with investigating Catholicism maybe tell the priest about your therapist's worries.",
            "It sounds like your therapist has a pretty oversimplified and stereotypical view of Catholicism. I'd say that if they fail to accept what is the most important part of your life then they are unlikely to be a good therapist."
