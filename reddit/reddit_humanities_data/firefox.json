Fakespot is a tool (recently bought by Mozilla) that uses machine learning and other techniques to combat fake reviews and manipulated ratings on Amazon and possibly Ebay. It rates product listings based on authenticity of the reviews, and adjusts ratings in accordance. And gives various other tools to help find products with authentic reviews from real users, summarize review highlights etc. I like it, its fairly useful, I don't want it installed on my main browser profile, but I have the extension installed ina profile that is specifically for shopping.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hxLH9TQ](https://imgur.com/a/hxLH9TQ)",
