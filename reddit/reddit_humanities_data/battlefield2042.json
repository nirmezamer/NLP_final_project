        "content": "With Battlefield 2042 essentially reaching the end of its support and the current battle pass nearing completion (just about four weeks of missions left), I thought it would be a good time to reflect on what we enjoyed about the game. Despite its ups and downs, I'm sure we all found something that kept us coming back.\n\nFor me, I really appreciated the ambitious attempt to include 128 players in matches. Even though it didn't quite pan out as expected, leading to map designs that favored the smaller 64-player counts, I still think it was a bold move worth noting.\n\nI also found some of the gadgets and traits from the specialists to be quite fun and innovative. There are definitely a few I hope to see return in future titles (gadgets and traits that is, not specialists), provided the setting allows for it.\n\nSo, what about you? What aspects of Battlefield 2042 did you enjoy the most? Whether it was specific maps, modes, weapons, or moments?",

            "I do not think they game did much right, but I do enjoy how they made team interactions profitable for the scoreboard. You get smoke, repair, spot, hack assists in this game, which is pretty good.\n\nI also really enjoyed how they elevated transports in the early months of the game. I never had as much fun as with the release hovercraft. For vehicles it is important that driving and gunning is fun and the transports filled that role generally. So instead of stationary solo vehicles we had people zipping around the map.",

            "- you get points for pretty much anything \n- interactions between specialists. Sometimes when reviving different specialist, the one you play with says something that implies a friendship and shared history \n- briefing at the start of the match. Reminds me of Operations in BF1. This should definitely stay in the next installments as it gives you a little bit of background on why the battle is happening \n- Plus system.
