        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/1dr80gv/has_teamplay_gotten_worse_in_the_last_years_no/",
        "content": "This is a question that comes up regularly, people report about not being picked up after death, finding no resupplies, nobody spotting, nobody pushing, nobody helping. Things that have always been common in the previous titles they played.\n\n**I never had this experience, but personal perception is always subjective, so I wondered if we can somehow quantify and qualify teamwork or at least team interaction, so that we do not have to base our argument on vibes. We sure can do that, mostly through stat tracking, but we can also qualify them further through analysing the changed mechanics.** \n\nDisclaimer: For all of these I will be using mostly my own stats, as I have been playing in the same way, with the same people for over a decade at this point. But over the course of the last months, I looked up people, especially in threads lamenting the decline in teamplay, and compared them to those of my mates and my own, to ensure it extrapolates at least to those people.   \n\n\n**As always with these analysing points, if the thread is understandably too long, just read whatever I highlight in BOLD.**\n\nSo let us start:\n\n1. **Revives**: This is the easiest to assess, since we have had it as a separate stat since we have a stat engine. This gave me the following results, **revives per match: BF4 2.9 , BF1 3.0, BFV 4.4, 2042 6.2.**   \nThis trend is very similar across all people I looked up. Some might have very close stats between BFV and 2042, but all revive significantly more often than compared to BF1 and 4. Cause is clear, squad revives allow everyone to revive, the 30s downtime allows medics to come for you from longer distances and I would also argue that the higher playercount in 2042 will lead to high density in certain areas which makes revives more probable. Hence you will get picked up significantly more often, especially when compared to BF1 and before.\n2. **Assists:** This is also pretty easy, but with a caveat since battlelog for BF4 only tracked assists count as kills and suppression assists, as far as I know. **Again assists per match: BF4 3.8, BF1 6.2, BFV 7.8, 2042 15.6.**   \nReasoning also pretty clear, you get smoke, hack, spot, repair, kill assists in 2042, whereas it would mostly be kill assists in previous titles. Whole specialists are built around assists and a Casper with a drone is one of the arguably most important people in a match of BT. Assists also place you comfortably on the scoreboard so there is a real incentive to go for them. This is also a stat that extrapolates well to others.\n3. **Captures**: This is where it gets a bit tricky, as I would indeed say that 1, V but especially 2042 discourages capturing by map design and capture time, **so here are the captures per match: BF4 5.9, BF1 3,3, BFV does not track captures (as far as I can see), 2042 1.8(!).**   \nYou see how traversal distance and lack of cover has affected the amount of captures negatively, as do the ridiculously long capture times. Probably the playercount, too. Easier to kill four people in 15s than 8 and more in 30s. I will point out that captures in 2042 probably include neutralizations as well as sector captures, that do not necessarily result in a flag capture. So, I really do on average only take the 1-2 gimmes. This stat does not extrapolate well, of course, and heavily depends on playstyle, but highlights an issue how players are funneled differently in 2042.  \nStill we can look at another stat that might shine a slightly different light on things, which is flags/sectors defended per match, which usually is kills done on objective: BF4 5.7, BF1 3.8, BFV (again does not track), 2042 9.9.  \nThis shows how defensive and stable in nature this game has become. Capturing is made hard and inconvenient due to distances to traver and the capture times. Still people spend a lot of time fighting around them. Here I would concede the point to previous titles, but especially BF4.\n4. **Resupplies per match: BF4 4.1, BF1 8.4, BFV 12.1, 2042 4.7.** While easy to quantify, qualifying plays a role here: In BF1 and V we would spam pouches as these were easy points. Still resupplying a magazine that will not be used in a player's life is worth less than resupplying a rocket that can be crucial in taking out a vehicle. Still the differences are staggering, you can not argue with BFV's numbers. Heals fall into the same category. The easier it is, the more people will do it. Still we are looking at higher resupply numbers than in BF4, where you had to wait very long for gadgets to fill up, now it is instant. In BFV it would also require active input for gadgets, while in 2042 it is passive. All in all I think heals and resupplies are not uncommon at all.  \nThings this game does not well though is that all ammo crates disappear from the small minimap beyond 30m, so I if you are looking for one it is necessarily hard. Likewise Angel's crate has only very limited usability in high traffic areas, because it needs a roof and time to call down. Still the small ammo crate works better than in all previous titles, by being passive and instant.\n5. **Spotting:** Again, a quality thing, while hard to quantify. But the reemergence of Q spotting alongside many popular spotting gadgets make it a much more convenient teamplay interaction than in BFV and even 1 and likely is **on a similar level as in BF4.**   \n\n\nThese are the major keypoints that make up team interaction in this game and that can objectively be quantified. There are soft factors that can attribute to perception, like community and social features. How easy and prevalent it is to play with friends as an example, which will greatly increase team interactions. However these vary from player to player and in-between games and are likely a driving factor in the perception of teamwork. If xXMasterReviver69Xx was part of your squad in BF4, but not now, you are likely experiencing less team interaction than then, but this is not due to the game mechanics, but because of context.\n\nOn the other hand 2042 also has many other forms of team interaction that are non-existant or not as prevalent in previous titles: Smoke as one prominent example, or Irish's APS and even his shield as well as Blasco's and Rao's hacks. There are many underestimated ways a teammate can impact others positively.\n\n**Conclusion: Upon analysing your own or others stats objectively, you can not really come to the conclusion that team interaction is universally worse than in previous titles. Due to its mechanics revives, which is the most common complaint, have significantly risen over the last decade. Likewise you get assists for basically many more actions, which will have an unprecedented reflection on the scoreboard. Spotting has made a return in many forms giving you and others immediate advantages. While resupplies and heals might not be able to hold up with the quantity of previous titles due to lower convenience, the quality of those has either remained the same or gone up.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Has it ever been this easy?](https://preview.redd.it/g938ovlgjh9d1.png?width=145&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea953cd6c24b66abbe12b18ab1882bc13f939e)\n\n**The only downgrade we have definitely seen over the last decade is in capturing flags, which is a process that started in BF1. Capture time, playercount and density, ticket mechanics and especially travel distance had a huge impact. Players till spend a lot of time on or near objectives, but capturing is made hard resulting in a much less dynamic game flow.** \n\n**The perception of any lack of teamplay can hence only be attributed to an subjective assessment of single situations and missing context**. \n\n**Most importantly info to take from this: You are getting revived a lot more and players help each other much more in many ways.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Higher level players understand their role considerably better. I have 17k plus revives as a tanker with 900 hours in a vehicle out of my 1300+ hours. When I play medic I smoke and revive, smoke and revive, smoke and revive. I\u2019ll go 5-0 but have 50+ revives.  Other *medic mains* will go 20-20 with 25 revives and argue they are helping more. *In terms of your main point I would agree that it\u2019s just as easy to revive but there are so many more mitigating circumstances that it will seem like less over a larger pool of games.*",
            "I watched the issue a bit more closely ever since I started to get annoyed by those \"nobody ever revives\"-threads. Most players are very willing to fill their class roles, especially in the medic class and ever since BFV, they are also embracing the smoke+revive combo more and more. I would even say smoke is more prevalent, you see it a lot on these maps.\n\nCan't say anything else other than I am rather happy with my teammates, they do a lot and are very willing.",
            "I don't see how quantity equals quality. I'm sure you can understand that given how long you've been playing. \n\nWho cares about revives in 2042 versus other games when the player counts are much higher? \n\nIn general, when squad sizes and player counts are higher, you water down the impact of teamplay. You can easily see this illustrated if you compare farming revives or resupplies on a map like locker vs other maps.\n\nAlso your conclusion is pretty weak given there are so many variables you don't control for at all lol.\n\nThis seems like more of some humble brag \"look at how many revives I have! I'm so good\"",
            "> For all of these I will be using mostly my own stats, as I have been playing in the same way, with the same people for over a decade at this point. \n\nThe pov is very biased. I have played with multiple clans in bf3 and 4. Large friend groups in 5 and 1 and completely solo in 2042. \n\nTeamplay is completely different across each option but more so is who you play with and for how long. Playing solo for the entirety of 2042 I can say with 100% certainly is the longer the game out the more it regresses in skill. As time goes on it exponentially gets less team oriented. This with the added fact of bots that don\u2019t help the game flow, makes games even more unbalanced due to lost team based actions.\n\nBy playing with the same friends for a decade as you say, you\u2019re a 1% type player that doesn\u2019t have the same experience 99% of the playerbase will. You don\u2019t have team mates not only ignoring you but actively playing against you because they recognize your name or you have 100 kills.",
            "Didn't read.\n\n\nSame as I remember back in BF2 really.\n\n\nOnly competitive has team play. Not to say it doesn't exist.",
            "Wow this is amazing - cheers for the research and write-up! This is heartening to see! =D\n\nI just had a few rounds on the Friday Night Battlefield Breaththrough rotation and was lucky to get on a brilliant team - Looking at the scoreboard it was amazing to see how many assists our team had (revives/repairs etc).  \n\nAlso worth mentioning is vehicle strategy - you can tell a good tanker who is positioning themselves to back out of hotspots for repairs - a bunch of us reppers were ready when he backed out of the hotzone and we saved the tank a few times for sure. \n\nYou know I think it's a lot of the veteran players who learnt teamplay from previous BF titles who are carrying this learnt behaviour into this title - those who are new to the franchise have too many options and if you come from something run and gun, that's how you're going to play by default. Teamwork always is a much more rewarding gameplay loop though which is why I keep coming back to BF.  \n\nP.S. A new awesome teamplay loop I love is running Angel with the loadout crate - that thing is just unlimited ammo it seems, and if you put it in a good spot - you have unlimited smoke grenades for safe revives all day around you and your engineers can restock anti-vehicle ammo too.",
            "Maybe it's region specific but spotting frequency is nowhere close to BF4 levels, at least not in EU. Hardly anyone spots in this game... I doubt the majority of players even know Q spotting exists.\n\nAs to why that's the case is hard to pinpoint. BFV didn't have 'manual' Q spotting and neither did 2042 until Season 3, so maybe it has become a lost art. The game is also accessible on gamepass so it has a more casual, revolving-door crowd who never learned to Q spot as it's not really explained anywhere.\n\nI reckon crossplay also plays a factor in it. Controllers have always had a more cumbersome spotting experience compared to MnK. That's why seemingly redundant gadgets like Auto Spotting scopes and attachments existed in previous games e.g. BC2 and BF4. The modern RB/R1 solution seems better than Back/Select spam but it's still like finding a unicorn when you see other than you spot in games.",
            "Thanks, mate.\n\nYeah, there is a distinction you can make between, what I call team interactions, like reviving, spotting etc. and what I would consider actual team work, consisting of more complex actions or chain of actions, which would for example be smoke and revive or clear and revive or communicate a resupply need and someone acting on it. Or something even more complex, like attacking a flag to stop the bleed.\n\nI still think 2042 does it really well and the best actions are still the simplest and you get a lot of rewards. Revives, assists, spotting etc..",
            "Oh yeah, it is biased, but it is stable. But that is what I mean with context. I play the same way as more than 10 years ago, with the same people and the same playstyle. With the same playstyle and people my revives per match have doubled.\n\nAnd even then, as said, I checked with people that are on my friends list, to validate results, even though I do not play with them and I checked people in the numerous threads here. Usually the ones that complained about the lack of, usually, revives. That dataset included you as well btw.\n\nSo, even though you main vehicles you manage to pick up far more people. Or do assists compared to BFV. The question then is, how anyone can come to the conclusion that revives etc. are less common, when the mechanics around it became so much more convenient?",
            "Thanks, I mean it is not really research, the dataset is just something I dabbled with over the last couple of months. Basically whenever a thread popped up complaining about revives I went through the stats of some contributors there and looked for patterns, backed up by people in my friendlist and others that I know the stats off. It is not representative and only made up of maybe 20-30 people, with only a third having relevant stats from BF4 onwards.\n\nIt is enough to make a point, though and how subjective perception can really be.\n\nI got a bit annoyed with all those videos where some dude is not getting picked up and made it a general thing.\n\nWhen it comes to team interactions 2042 does a lot of things right and I hope they retain that for the next title. Players are also generally incentivised and very willing to throw themselves in for the team effort. The mechanics even make that rewarding and very inclusive."
