I will collate any and all valuable information by other users and update this thread as we go. Seasoned users please pitch in with anything that should be included.\n\nMany thanks to u/BlueSix for assisting in putting this together.\n\nWhat's covered:\n\n* The .COM vs .ORG Issue\n* Hosting - Where should I host?\n* Performance - Why is my site slow / Pagespeed score appalling?\n* Building Your WordPress Site: Is X builder better than Y? What is the best theme? Etc.\n* Updates\n* Backups\n* Security\n* Combating spam comments, contact form submissions & bot registrations\n* Hacks/Malware: Err guys help, there\u2019s some weird stuff on my front end\n* Resources to learn WordPress\n* Where to find plugins/add feature X?\n* I found a plugin that costs $50 for $5 on a \u201cGPLDL\u201d source, is it safe to use?\n\n# The .COM vs .ORG issue\n\nThis one is probably the single most asked question in this sub. Why can\u2019t I do x,y,z?, Why do I have to pay more to install a plugin or edit a theme? Etc.etc. There are literally 100\u2019s of threads about this. If you want more info please search the sub for [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) or [read this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/rremcd/the_difference_between_wordpress_com_and_org/) by u/summerchilde\n\nTo summarise:  \nWordPress is free, open source software which can be found at [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/).\n\nThink of [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) as a host that is using .org\u2019s software and has various functionality locked behind pricing tiers.\n\nWhat you want to do is get your own cheaper hosting and self install and manage WordPress so you don\u2019t have any restrictions at base software level.\n\n# Hosting - Where should I host?\n\nThe next big question is who is a good host? This is better suited for r/webhosting.\n\nHaving said that, there are plenty of different hosts to choose from. Shared web hosting is the cheapest but comes with the caveat that performance is shared with others on your same server. Dedicated, VPS and Cloud solutions are faster but more expensive.\n\nThe thing to remember here is performance is directly tied to price and you get what you pay for.\n\nThe most recommended hosts around here that I\u2019ve seen are Digital Ocean, Cloudways and Siteground. Again, for specific hosting questions you will get better support at r/webhosting\n\n# Performance - Why is my site slow / Pagespeed score apalling?\n\n# #1 Hosting\n\nMost of the time it's just bad hosting. As mentioned earlier, cheap shared hosting is notorious for bad performance. If your host is slow then nothing else will matter much, so this is your first port of call.\n\n# 2 Properly optimise images\n\nThis is a relatively simple one. Don\u2019t use images that are 6000 x 4000px. Figure out the max display size for your use case and resize.\n\nSecondly ditch PNG and JPG and use WEBP. The recommendation is to convert before you upload. Most image editors will let you save in webp and 75-80% compression works well for a balance.\n\nTo bulk convert, use [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/) or [Photoshop Batch process](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/photoshop/using/processing-batch-files.html).\n\nFor existing media you can use a plugin. There are many Smush, Optimole etc. [Converter For Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webp-converter-for-media/) is a free option.\n\nSome servers like Siteground and/or other optimisation plugins may have this feature inbuilt so always check so you don\u2019t end up doubling up.\n\nSince 6.3, WordPress can also convert to WEBP on upload. You can use the [Performance Lab](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/07/the-performance-lab-plugin-has-been-released/) plugin by the WordPress team themselves to manage this.\n\nIf, like me, you don\u2019t want your server getting clogged up with multiple image types and you only want to have the WEBP files OR you don\u2019t want to use a plugin use [this snippet](https://gist.github.com/Acephalia/b26d91698806c9d7d2521911bf194a12).\n\n# #3 Lazy load\n\nLazy loading images, videos and iframes will speed up things significantly [since 5.3 this has been a feature in core WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/14/lazy-loading-images-in-5-5/) and should work out of the box for most cases. Some themes/page builders will have an option for this as well. Some hosts and caching plugins like WP Rocket will also have this option.\n\nIf you find that it is not working on your site for some reason you can use a plugin such as [Lazy Load by WP Rocket](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/) or [A3 Lazy Load](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/) for more control.\n\n# #4 Caching, CDNs. Minification Etc.\n\nYou should be using caching on your website if you care about performance.\n\n***WARNING: Using minification and/or combining files and scripts can cause your website to break so always test, test and test again!***\n\nThere are [many, many free and paid plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/caching/) for this. Some hosts will have their own caching plugin, this should be preferred over others. If you have a Litespeed enabled server use Litespeed.\n\nThe general recommendation here is to use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) free with [Super Page Cache For CF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cloudflare-page-cache/). Here is [a guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) on how to set up your domain, after that follow the plugin instructions.\n\n***Common question #1: Should I keep my hosts caching on with CF?***  \nYes. Your server is the origin server and having your own files cached means it is less taxing on your server resources and CF fetches files faster.\n\n***Common Question #2: I\u2019m getting an SSL error or redirect loop.***  \nMake sure you have a valid SSL certificate server on your origin server and make sure to set Cloudflare > SSL/TLS > Overview to Full.\n\n~~Cloudflare also has its own minification settings under : Speed > Optimisation.~~ Discontinued from 2024-08-05.\n\nOther popular recommended options:\n\n* [WP Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/) (Subscription)\n* [Perfmatters](https://perfmatters.io/) (Subscription)\n* [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) (Free)\n\n# Advanced optimisation\n\nIf you really want to get under the hood and squeeze every last bit out of your setup then:\n\n* Use a plugin like [Debloat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debloat/) for a quick clean up.\n* Use [Asset Clean Up](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/) to go through each page and disable unused crap. (Time consuming but potentially massive gains).\n* Use [Query Monitor](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) to inspect what is going on under the hood and find unnecessary scripts etc.\n\nIf that is still not enough here is a ~~73~~ ~~203~~ bazillion page[ guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncQcxnD-CxDk4h01QYyrlOh1lEYDS-DV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114514252262811175804&rtpof=true&sd=true) by u/jazir5\n\n# Building Your WordPress Site: Is X builder better than Y? What is the best theme? Etc.\n\nThere are many conflicting opinions on this because there is no one way to do things on WordPress. Each camp will tell you the other one is inferior and purists dislike all of them.\n\nYou can build your site with:\n\n* A page builder : [Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/), [Elementor](https://elementor.com/), [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) etc.\n* Using prebuilt themes. Each theme will have its own settings that\u2019s exclusive to it.\n* A completely custom coded setup, written with a combination of html, css and php using WordPress actions, filters and hooks.\n\nMy two cents on the matter: Budget, experience and skill all come into play here. Thus, what works for you to achieve your end goal is the best.\n\n* If you like a WYSIWYG approach then page builders will more likely be your thing. Play around with the demos, watch some tutorials and if one of them looks more likely to work for you, then take it for a spin.\n* The Twenty Twenty Four theme along with the block builder is a solid place to start. There are [many tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=twenty+twenty+four+theme+guide.) on how to get started with 2024 including the official [WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-four/).\n* A CSS editor such as [Yellow Pencil](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yellow-pencil-visual-theme-customizer/) or [Microthemer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/microthemer/) will assist you to fix a lot of front end annoyances and supplements any workflow.\n\n# Updates\n\nStay up to date with all plugins and core software at all times if you don\u2019t want to have security holes and get hacked.\n\n# Backups\n\nTaking/having backups of your website are essential. Servers can crash and data can be lost and you will cry if you end up without a backup in this scenario. The stress and grief of not having a backup and having to rebuild your site from scratch is not worth it. There's a few ways you can go about taking backups.\n\nYou can:\n\n* Use a recommended plugin like [UpdraftPlus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/) to schedule for daily, weekly or monthly backups. Send backups to remote servers (AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive) or your local machine. ***Remember having them stored on the same server as the website is not going to help.***\n* Include this in your hosting requirements and find a host that automatically provides a scheduled backup process.\n* In the very least, take a manual backup using your hosts control panel whenever you make a significant change to your website,.\n\n# Security\n\n* Keep everything up to date at all times.\n* Run updates at least once a month. Fortnightly is better. More frequently is better\n* Use plugins and themes that are well supported, frequently updated, high install counts, well ranked, well established.\n* Use [Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) - it\u2019ll alert you when any plugins that you\u2019re using have a known vulnerability or haven\u2019t been updated (by the developer) for 2 or more years. It will also protect you from known attack vectors for vulnerable plugins (for the free version, this protection is only available after the vulnerability is 30 days old, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you updating your plugins, assuming a patch is available).\n* Don\u2019t use hosting where multiple sites sit in the one account (common on shared hosting). Each website should have its own owner.\n\n# Combating spam comments, fontact form submissions & bot registrations\n\nDisable comments and user sign ups sitewide if you don't use them.\n\nUse a captcha on login, register and all contact/comment forms.\n\n* [Google Recaptcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-google-recaptcha/), [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cloudflare-turnstile/) (Free)\n* [Cleantalk](https://cleantalk.org/) for a non captcha based solution (paid but very cheap)\n* [Honeypot](https://wordpress.org/plugins/honeypot/) for a simple non captcha based solution.\n\n# Hacks/Malware: Err guys help, there\u2019s some weird stuff on my front end.\n\nCongratulations you got hacked. Most of us have dealt with this in one way or another at some point so you aren\u2019t alone.\n\nDo you have a backup?\n\n* Easy, wipe everything and restore.\n* Run a scan with [Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) and/or [GOTMLS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gotmls/) to be doubly sure you are clean.\n* Harden your security to avoid repeat issues.\n\nNo backup? (Get the tissues)\n\n* Install [Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) and run scan.\n* Alternatively my first port of call for this has always been [GOTMLS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gotmls/). Update definitions and run a root scan the plugin should find any code that shouldn\u2019t be there and you should be good to go.\n\n# Resources to learn WordPress\n\nIf you are serious about your WordPress journey then you must equip yourself with some coding knowledge. Some skills in PHP, Javascript, CSS & HTML will help you immensely.\n\n* [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/)\n* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (HTML, CSS)\n* [WordPress Developer](https://developer.wordpress.org/)\n* [WordPress Hooks, Actions & Functions](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-hooks/) (Quick Start)\n\n# Where to find plugins/add feature X?\n\nThe WordPress [plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) should be your first stop. You can access this library via your Dashboard > Plugins > Add New Plugin\n\nCodecanyon is a decent marketplace to get premium plugins for a one off buy without ongoing subscription costs.\n\nFor code snippets and help with your own code [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wordpress) or r/prowordpress is your best bet.\n\n***Warning: Remember to always double check the source and reputability of a source before installing third-party plugins and/or scripts.***\n\n# I found a plugin that costs $50 for $5 on a \u201cGPLDL\u201d source, is it safe to use?\n\nThe simple answer here is NO. No you shouldn\u2019t and that should be the end of that.\n\nBut alas, we still have many more questions:\n\n* Will the plugin still work? Probably.\n* Are there any guarantees that it will work and demo content will be provided? Absolutely not.\n* Will there be links to turn one\u2019s junk into a cyborg on my site? Most likely.\n* Will Google blacklist you? If you have malware. Most definitely.\n* Will your host shut you down? If detected, any reputable one will.\n* Is rebuilding an entire site and losing the trust of your audience worth all this? Not to me, but only you can answer this for yourself.\n\nThat\u2019s it, hopefully this gets you started on your WordPress journey. If you have any further questions feel free to leave a comment and someone should be able to assist.\n\n*Last edited 29/05/2024*  \n*- Fixed typos*  \n*- Removed Cloudflare Minification (EOL)*  \n*- Added Combating Spam section.*",
