            "How much would you charge\n\nHi guys,\nI recently made this website (linked) for a client for free  because I\u2019m still new and wanted to build my portfolio since im still a teenage dev.\nI\u2019ve had around 4 1hour meetings with her surrounding the website, i helped her with the domain transfer, designed it based on what she told me she liked, chose the color palette and fonts etc, it was a really fun experience. We did abt 3 versions and I\u2019m about to submit a last version tonight. Its a cute little basic website because she didnt want too much things, just a home contact and terms and conditions page.\n2 questions:\n1. If I was to charge for this, how much should I charge?\n2. How do I ask for reviews or referalls?\nThx vm!\n\n\n[Website link (its in french)](https://deva-conciergerie.com)",

            "I am halfway through my first web dev bootcamp/course, and I am still not sure what to put on my \"to-do\" list, so I can achieve the goals I have.\n\nI work in IT (not programming/webdev) for close to ten years now and do design work for some side income. In the last couple of years, I really wanted to start creating websites and learn basic programming. Because in the beginning, I won't be creating complex stuff, online shops or even apps, I thought I am fine with learning the basic HTML/CSS/JS combo and learn as I go.\n\nSo here is my \"problem\":\n\nI can now create basic websites and would also know what to look into next, so I can incorporate things like animation or more complex styling, for example. But how do I cover topics like security or a CMS without using something like WordPress? In my head, I either let someone else do everything backend related or I learn everything (front- and backend), so I can do \"everything\" myself.\n\nI know learning something like web development takes time, and I don't have a problem studying for months or even years for it. But I am unsure what I should focus on if I want to offer basic websites first and increase the complexity in the future. \n\nFor example, I would love to some day create a website with simulations/physics and typography/letters. If I now start using WordPress or something like Webflow, I feel like I would stop learning web development and start learning how to use WordPress/Webflow instead? Maybe someone can help me out, I am super confused because there is so much stuff to learn!\n\nI appreciate any help with my confusion. Thanks in advance, and thank you for taking the time!

            "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently working through the courses on freeCodeCamp and, although I appreciate having the objectives and content available online, I find that I learn best when I write things down. In school, I used to find it really helpful to print PowerPoint slides with a notes section for reference.\n\nI\u2019m looking for advice on how to efficiently take notes for freeCodeCamp courses without having to write down the entire course content. Ideally, I want to capture the most important information, concepts, and code snippets in a way that\u2019s easy to reference later. I tried taking screenshots and cutting/pasting them in my scribbler but that takes alot of time\u2026 and screenshots when shrank were just gross. I am definately a visual person so to reference things I will need pictures.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or best practices for organizing notes effectively while using freeCodeCamp? Are there any tools or templates that you find particularly useful? How do you structure your notes to make sure they are helpful for review and study?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

            "Former experienced LAMP / (PHP and Perl) developer looking for direction in the new WebDev era\n\nTL;DR - I need webdev upskill recs -\n\nI'll try not to waste anyone's time but thanks in advance for your perspective. In the late 90s into the mid 2000s I used to put together Web front ends for medical research projects using MySQL databases on top of LAMP stack where \"P\" was using both Perl (mostly the CGI module) and later PHP. I managed everything - the linux box, the database, etc.\n\nThe websites were basic HTML with CSS styles I emulated from similar websites of the time. no one would accuse me of being a \"designer\" but I did okay. At the time I started experimenting with things like Zope and Perl Mason which aren't really used (that much) anymore although I did put together a nice departmental site using Zope that ran quite well.\n\nI also started learning Javascript and put together some nice pages that allowed people to manage their files on a server. Messed around with Django also. Looked at Drupal a while back but didn't have time to dive in.\n\nAfter that I moved more into math-based programming projects and didn't look at building websites. So as of late I've been interested in re-entering the world of front-end stuff (though I don't mind doing databse stuff also). Someone kicked me towards Next.js but wanted to see what others might recommend.\n\nRemember, I'm a tech guy so don't worry about throwing details at me. If your preferred framework works better with say NGINX (or not) I'm happy to hear about that. Thanks,",

            "When you have to absolutely position something but keep it fixed in one spot in the section, this is what I do. \n\nLeft: 50% and Margin left negative or positive however much I need to move it off the center line. \n\nIn the design I will measure how far away from the center line of the design that the left edge of my graphic is. Maybe it\u2019s 200px LEFT of the center line. So left: 50% will place the left edge of my graphic at the 50% center line of the parent container. It will always be positioned there no matter how wide the container gets. Its left edge will always be at the center line if the parent. Now I use margin to push it off that center line. Positive margin left will move it to the right and negative will pull it to the left. So if it\u2019s 200px left of the center line, I do margin-left: 200px to push it 200px off the center line to the right of it. \n\nI use this all the time to absolutely place elements in a section and not have them tied to a right or left edge of a parent. Because when that parent gets wider, they go more and more left. I don\u2019t want that. I want it to stay in its position in the design regardless of how wide its container parent gets. \n\nTrick number 2:\n\nFont size scaling. Let say you have an image group of like 4 images and they\u2019re overlapping each other. How do you make this responsive? \n\nYou first measure out the box that they occupy in the design. Find the top most image and left most and right most and bottom most. Their edges will make the main \u201cbox\u201d they live in. So I add a Div with 4 images inside of it. If that box they make is 400x600px, I make a Div that is 400/16em wide and 600/16em tall. Or 25em wide and 37.5em tall. Why Ems? We will find out later! \n\nSo now we have our box set. Add position relative to it and z index 1. Inside of it you have the images all absolutely positioned inside that box. Add their height and widths in em. Same as their top and left and right values. All in Ems. So the top most one is top:0 and maybe it\u2019s 16/16em (1em) off the left edge of the box. So left: 1em. The right most image is right: 0 and maybe it\u2019s off the top by 32/16em (2em) etc. you see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re absolutely positioning each image relative to the parent \u201cbox\u201d they live in. Once you\u2019re done with that you set your screen size to 360px for mobile. \n\nOn the parent box, set the font size to min(1.4vw, 1rem);\n\nWhat this does is sets the font size of the parent to the vw value. So the wider the screen gets the larger the font size gets. And stops when the font sizes equals 1rem (16px) which is tied to the root element (html tag) default font size (which is 16px).\n\nThis scales the ems inside of the box. All of them use Ems. Which pull their ratio value for em from the font size of their parent. So if your parents font size is tied to vw, so are the children that use Ems for their values. So as the view width gets wider, the font size of the parent box gets wider and the children scale proportionally with the vw. You need to play with the vw value till your box fits within the container on mobile. Sometimes it\u2019s 1.4vw, or 2.2vw. Whatever you need to shrink it so it fits nicely on screen within the container. The smaller the vw unit you use the smaller the box and its children will be. This is how you effectively use font size scaling. We create a group of images that we build once and in one size, and scale them down proportionally so they fit on mobile and grow with the screen until it reaches its final form. I use this ALL the time. \n\nI use it for the image groups on this site I made \n\nhttps://makopoolrestorations.com\n\nSet the screen size to 360 px and watch those image groups grow proportionally as you drag the screen size wider. It\u2019s literal responsive magic. And it rapidly speeds up your development since you\u2019re building it once and scaling it down. \n\nThe other thing I do for trick number 3 is images. I wrap all my images in a picture element and have source tags to load mobile sides images on small screen sizes and the desktop image on larger screens. I set the width and height manually on the picture elements, then absolutely position the images Inside of the picture element, height and width 100%, top and left 0, object-fit: cover. What this does is makes the image \u201ccover\u201d the entire parents dimensions and scales the image up to fit it automatically. When  I do this, that means I can swap out the images anytime I want and not have to worry about them being the same width and height of the one they\u2019re replacing. It will automatically scale up to \u201ccover\u201d its parent and be centered inside of it. Now I can swap images without worrying about different sized images breaking the design because they had a different height and width than the original. You can also see this done on the mako site I linked. All my images are done that way. \n\nI also do that for my background images for sections. Because now I can add the lazy loading tag to the img tag and lazy load my background images and serve mobile sized images on mobile. Boosting my load times and performance. \n\nThese are the three biggest css hacks I use to build my websites. \n\nThe also did the left 50% margin left trick on that shark graphic in the mako site near the hero section. Expect I did right: 50% and margin right. That site utilizes all three css tricks I mentioned. Perfect example to showcase what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nEnjoy!",
