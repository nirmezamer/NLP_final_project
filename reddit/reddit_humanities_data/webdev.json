My question is if I can mention this in my cv when applying for web development job, would it be irrelevant? Would it help me boost my chances or is it useless for that role?  I feel like Im wasting my time since I don't want to apply for a mobile development job in the future.",

        "content": "Anyone who has learned HTML has probably been told at some point not to use `<b>` and `<i>` and instead use semantic `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for screenreaders.\n\nBut screenreaders don't read out whether text is in **bold** or *italics* by default ([because it's annoying](https://matthiasott.com/notes/screen-readers-semantics-strong-em)). And because the rule is often interpreted as \"do not use `<b>` and `<i>`,\" developers and WYSIWYG editors alike use `<strong>` and `<em>` for everything, even if the bold or italics is purely visual rather than having a semantic meaning.\n\n`<article>` and `<section>` are supposed to be semantic replacements for `<div>`, but the difference between them is vague, and [screenreaders don't treat them specially either, by default](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43895624).\n\nSince everyone has a different idea of what those elements mean (they're too generic), it's not very useful as a semantic element for readable HTML (it might end up being more confusing when someone sees `<section>` used instead of `<div>`, without any further explanation). So is there any reason to use them?",

Search engine crawlers use semantic markup to better understand content for instance.\n\nSome valid points about content editor buttons but that should be a sign that they need to get better, not that we should abandon semantic markup. Developers and content creators basically need to learn these distinctions better to know when to use which tag.",

We all use classes for those things. I'd be super interested to know if a screen reader does anything different for them and if SR users get any benefit out of it if so.",

Of course, spending a lot of time on Reddit has made me believe that I will be out of a job for the next 6 months to a year, and maybe even need to move back to my home country because remote is also dead. I do only reach out to EU companies to work with, because I like to work with them. \n\nWell, let it be told, that since I got laid off I already have had 4 offers, they aren't great, but 3 of them weren't completely terrible. I signed one freelance offer (already worked there for a full week), and yesterday I signed one full-time contractor offer for a 12 month period. Both remote! The combined salary is a little lower than my previous job ($6.5k vs $4.8-$5.5k), but I will keep interviewing for something better. There are still 3 hiring processes that I am going through, so it may not be the last offer I receive from applying in May/June.\n\nAbout me: Full-stack developer with 6 years of experience, mostly as a contractor and freelancer at startups.",

I got laid off and got something a little better but I was pretty fucking underpaid before, and in the grand scheme of things I should be making at least 30k more than I am now given salaries for similar positions before the interest rate hike. I have a buddy that went from making 400k take home (200cash, 200stock) to 210total (170cash, 40 stock). I mean he\u2019s still good obviously but big drop\u00a0",
