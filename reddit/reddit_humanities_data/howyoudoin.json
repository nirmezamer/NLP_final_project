        "content": "First of all, I apologize on behalf of the moderators for not being responsive enough during the situation we had in this subreddit a few days ago. I\u2019m not blaming the other moderators, because like me, I assume all of them have their own chores to take care of. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m the newest addition so I usually stay away from stuff like this and let the senior mods handle it, but when I checked the mod queue yesterday (I logged in after months) , it was a dumpster fire. There were so many reports regarding breaking subreddit rules and verbally abusing cast members and subredditors. The main culprit had already been banned , I think one of the other moderators had done that. But there were other creeps who were still roaming free in the sub. I don\u2019t judge people for being horny but there are NSFW subreddits for those kind of things. Also, no one, and I mean no one disrespects Phoebe in this sub! (Rachel and Monica too). But seriously, how much a scum you have to be constantly spamming with posts that degrade women, let alone celebrities? These people should be getting professional help. \n\nSo I went over the reports and deleted posts and comments that had broken the sub rules. Remember you are allowed to criticize a character (that too without calling them slurs) but not the actor/actress. Is that too hard to understand? \nAnd afterwards I checked post history of the users that kept spamming the sub and banned them. Some users who had violated rules once or twice got 1 week / 2 weeks ban while the other got permanent bans. Don\u2019t harass the mods via alternative accounts, asking to overturn that. I made sure I checked the previous post and comment history before banning them. I\u2019ve tried my best to check the reports, some of them were not breaking the rules at all (like memes), and this sub lacks memes imo, therefore I didn\u2019t remove every reported post/comment. If you still have issues, please report them or if it\u2019s too severe, reach out to moderators. And please don\u2019t direct message me, because I\u2019m not always logged in and if you send the message to moderators, chances are at least one of us would see that. \n\nFriends is a sitcom that started airing almost 3 decades ago and while it might not always resonate with the cultural and ethical standards today, we can always get the positive points out of it and have civilized discussions about the show and the characters. This is a wholesome sitcom and therefore, I believe the subreddit too has to be like that. I\u2019ve seen fan subreddits that allow assholes to run rampant but this one shouldn\u2019t be like that. People (including me) love this show not just because of its humor element, but also it acts like a virtual friend who comforts us. So let\u2019s keep the subreddit wholesome so that even the newcomers can enjoy it. \n\nAlso, no politics. Period. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re left wing, right wing or Chicken wing, this isn\u2019t the sub for that. For the love of God, if any of you started abusing fellow members or cast members, you too will be kicked out, because here in this subreddit we don\u2019t allow sexist, misogynistic assholes. They can sod off. \n\nThank you.",

The actors used to tell the producers when they were getting a cut or color change, but the producers did not ask them to do so. The actors just did it out of courtesy. The producers said that they never had anything to say about the actors' personal choices regarding hair. They just let the actors choose their own style and made the necessary adjustments in the show, like dyeing Matt LeBlanc's grays or using a longer wig to cover Lisa's shorter hair cut.",
