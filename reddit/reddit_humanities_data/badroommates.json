They said they are gonna be out today but I checked the camera in the living room, they haven\u2019t even gone out today and there are no signs that they are packing stuff.\n\nThey are not on the lease btw. I\u2019m filing eviction paperwork to kick them out but it costs lots of money (250$ just for filing) and at least 5 weeks for the court order. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of this shit. Even we could kick them out, no way we could get our money back that they have been free loading in our place as we were so naive that we didn\u2019t ask for their photo Id or ssn. They have 12 fans in the room and blast our AC everyday. At this point, I don\u2019t think we will find another roommate. ",

        "content": "I am so fed up with my roommate right now. This guy is always late on the internet and WiFi payments, and it\u2019s driving me nuts. It's not like he can't afford it either. I know for a fact he makes bank gambling on Stake. Just last night, he won $4k! I literally saw him withdraw it all online, and he still refuses to pay his share of the internet bill. How is that even fair?  \n  \nIt\u2019s not like we're talking about huge amounts here. We split the bills evenly, and the WiFi isn\u2019t even that expensive. But every month, it's the same story: he\u2019s \u201cshort on cash\u201d or \u201cwaiting for a payout.\u201d Meanwhile, he\u2019s out here making thousands from gambling, buying new gadgets, and ordering takeout every night. But when it comes to paying the internet bill, suddenly he's broke.  \n  \nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about it multiple times. I\u2019ve even shown him the due dates and explained how it affects our connection when the bill isn\u2019t paid on time. He always promises to pay me back \u201cnext time\u201d or \u201cwhen he gets his next big win,\u201d but it never happens. I\u2019m tired of covering for him and having to chase him down for his share.  \n  \nWhat makes it worse is the sheer disrespect. I work hard for my money and make sure all my bills are paid on time. Meanwhile, he's gambling away thousands and still can\u2019t pitch in for basic utilities. It\u2019s so frustrating and unfair.  \n  \nAnyone else deal with something like this? How do you handle a roommate who refuses to pay their share despite clearly having the money? I\u2019m seriously considering finding a new place because I can\u2019t keep living like this. Any advice or similar stories would be appreciated. Thanks for letting me vent.",

            "Your roommate doesn't make as much money as he portrays.  He won 4k today but probably lost 8k in the past two months.  That's the life of most gamblers; give the image like they are doing well in the light but gnash their teeth in the dark.\n\nYour roommate is always late on the payments for two reasons.  1.  He loses more money than he wins.  2.  His gambling high is more important than paying you.",
            "How much your roommate makes is irrelevant he has to pay his bills. I'd call him out when he is ordering out and I'd change the wifi password.",

            "Change the password to the WiFi? Easy.\nAlso this guy sounds like my brother. Puts his wants in front of his needs. Never has any money if there is a bill to pay or he owes someone money. But there is a new game or a gun or something he wants he suddenly has the exact amount for it right then and there.",
            "He needs the $4,000 because he's down $20,000 for the year and thinks he can gamble the $4,000 to come out ahead. Money going towards bills is money he can't use to make his losses back.",

We live in a multi family housing situation so I kinda hear everything and our trash bins are together.I've asked our property manager if they can ask her to stop putting her trash in my bins but I guess she didn't. \nI feel like I've tried being a good neighbor considering we are in similar situations. When we first met it was pretty alright and we hung out a few times. I noticed she was kinda strange but i looked past it because it was nice to have a friend.\nI just started seeing her kind of thought process, anxious, paranoid, introverted, often yelling in her home and lashing out at our manager,\nShe throws bags of trash down her steps and leaves them there. She refuses to take accountability and blames everything on others. I think she only knows how to deflect blame. It sucks and she decided to stop talking to me after I spoke up about this type of behavior. She keeps putting her trash in my trash bin, not asking, leaving hers empty for me to have mine filled or be the first one to put trash in it. I've been really nervous to send her a text because I would just want to avoid confrontation at all. \nIdk but I feel like if I don't send it I'm kind of just letting her step on me. \nIt's hard when I'm trying to be responsible for my bin and I take it out on time, bring it in on time for the most part. So like why do I have to pay for her forgetting to take hers out?\nI just feel so anxious and unsure about what to do. And it's not like she doesn't notice I take her trash out my bin anyways smh. \nShe once told me when we were hanging out that \"She's just a girl\" but gosh, she's older than me and a mother I just don't her how. I feel like I can't even be comfortable in my home a bit ngl cause I don't want anything to do with her anymore. \nIt's kinda sad\nAnyways lmk what you think or what advice you have for me\nI've been debating sending this text cause I'm feeling so nervous abt it \n",

You should just tell them up  front or leave a note on the bin saying not to use it unless it's you .\n\nIdk I was a very socially awkward roommate myself who didn't understand some social boundaries when I first started living with other people.

She\u2019s super cool and exuberant, and has done some really nice things like brought me breakfast in bed before.

The other day I woke up early and it wasn\u2019t there; she had come into my room while I was sleeping and had taken it downstairs with her. I obviously don\u2019t need it while I\u2019m sleeping, but I feel like my privacy has been invaded. She comes into my room often when I\u2019m home, which is NBD. There\u2019s been multiple instances this week where she comes into my room expecting me to be sleeping, but I\u2019m awake and then she sits on my bed waiting for the vape / immediately grabbing it. \n\nI still have a few months until I turn 21, so she\u2019s been grabbing them for me since I moved in which I recognize is a big ask. My other roommate also hits my vape, and now I\u2019m spending $20 every 6 days on 2 other people\u2019s vices on top of having my privacy invaded. They will text me that they miss me and to come home from any social events, but my roommate\u2019s boyfriend told me that they just do it so they can hit the vape . Am I in the wrong to feel this way? How do I even go about saying something since she\u2019s doing me a favor? I realize this is such a small, trivial, and stupid thing to be upset about but it\u2019s really making me feel weird. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to say she refuses to buy herself one because she\u2019s \u201ctrying to quit\u201d.
