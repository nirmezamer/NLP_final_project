        "content": "Second time posting this because some nice redditors pointed out you could still see my roommates names and my last name. Thank you to those two. \n\nLike the title says, one of my roommates, let\u2019s call him K, keeps stealing things from us. However we don\u2019t have solid proof so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t go to the police. He has left his door open and we were able to get some things he\u2019s stolen from us, but most of which we have not. They were the cheap things that were less than $10.\n\nThese things have ranged from expensive chef knives, all of my forks I inherited from my dad when he died, so much of MY food (which especially sucks when I\u2019m the second poorest in the house after K), finding my nice towels that are apart of a set that had gone missing in his laundry, shower products, my books he\u2019s taken and wouldn\u2019t return after I told him no, batteries for the remotes in the house, and like 8 of my mugs. Our mug shelf used to be FULL but is now as barren as I hope he will be.\n\nThe way we know it\u2019s him is that all of my other roommates have talked separately and some of their shit has gone missing too and this only started after he moved in. He is the latest addition to the house so I\u2019ve tried talking to him directly. He never answers his door, won\u2019t answer any text messages, and is seemingly impossible to catch in person because he\u2019ll just stay in his room until we have left the house. I won\u2019t just barge into his room; there are still lines I won\u2019t cross as a roommate. I\u2019m also afraid of retaliation. He has anger issues and aggressive tendencies and has guns in his room. We have heard him call me and my other gay roommate homophobic slurs when he gets angry when he thinks we can\u2019t hear him.\n\nI\u2019ve told all of this to our landlord but all he said was we could change our doorknobs to have a lock on them if we wanted to. \n\nI had had enough of his shit and trying to be nice by not pointing him out directly, trying to have one on one conversations to not put him on blast for the whole house while hoping he would own up to anything.\n\nWhile the things he has stolen from me have been small for the most part (the expensive chef knives are not mine), I\u2019ve had to go without food because of this fucker. But I don\u2019t have solid proof to go to the police with it.\n",

Realistically the safest option *is* to just make sure everything steal-able is locked down as much as possible, even though that sucks. He might not be likely to actually hurt anyone but I personally wouldn\u2019t take the chances. Sounds like it\u2019s a real POS you got on your hands here.",

I don't really jerk off much because I have a girlfriend, but would probably do the same if I were in his position. Should I mention it to him since he obviously isn't getting any action? To be completely honest what would I even say? Another seperate thing is he recently bought a fleshlight and leaves it around in the shower, at first I didn't have a problem with it but recently I had a friend come over who saw it and mentioned it was weird, this sorta made me change my mind on it. Would I be an asshole if I asked him to pack it away somewhere else, but idk how those things work if they need to be washed and its easier to keep in the shower for that or whatever?\nHas anyone been in a similar circumstance ?",
