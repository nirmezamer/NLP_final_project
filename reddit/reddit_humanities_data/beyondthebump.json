            "I do 99% of the night baby care and I\u2019m so so full of rage and resentment lately as my baby\u2019s nights have been absolute shit. And my partner has the audacity to complain he\u2019s tired and got no sleep because of some back pain and meanwhile he\u2019s had 10 uninterrupted hours.. meanwhile I\u2019m up at 11, 12, 3, 5, and up for the day at 7. What the fuck?",
            "Mine does the same and it fills me with so much rage when he'll complain he didn't sleep well or had to wake up early and only got 8 or 9 hours of sleep. Ok...I've been sleeping in 2-4 hours increments for nearly 7 months and often going multiple days in a row where I've only gotten at most 2 hours of sleep, but goodness forbid that my husband wake up before 7am",
            "WHY DO ALL MEN DO THIS! There should be some kind of pre-pregnancy checklist or class where MALE PARTNERS are warned to never ever say shit like this. This is grounds for murder IMO. I almost killed my husband in the newborn stage for these comments",
            "YES YES YES YES. Currently sitting here filled with rage because my partner walked in the door of our hotel room for our weekend vacation and fell dead asleep without even bothering to say \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap\u201d or \u201cis it okay if I take a quick nap?\u201d Meanwhile, I have been up with baby EVERY NIGHT for his whole life, woke up this morning and got baby ready, packed for all three of us, made baby\u2019s bottles and fed him on the drive down here, changed his diapers, everything. So I\u2019m like \u201cokay, guess I\u2019m on baby duty AGAIN\u201d and it\u2019s like he can just fall asleep because he knows everything is handled and baby will be taken care of. I adore him and he\u2019s great with our son but damn, being the default parent is exhausting.\u00a0",

            "I'm enjoying the slower pace of life being on maternity leave. I walk my toddler to nursery, I walk the dog, I see friends, I play with my baby and go to baby classes, I keep the house ticking over and do a bit of gardening subject to my baby being asleep or happy to play in her jumperoo.  I EBF and I'm grateful for the time to do that. \n\nI enjoy not having a commute, dealing with work politics, demanding clients, juggling housework, kids and work... you know the drill. Going back to work, I worry a bit about that but I'll cope.\n\n\nMy partner, smirked at me and said going back to work is going to be a shock to the system for me. \n\nTrue facts... I got my first job aged 17. I've been working longer than he has. I work damn hard when I work. On one hand I'm looking forward to going back. I'm going to start studying for the next level of professional qualifications. I feel in my groove and very confident in my abilities and am looking forward to working towards the next phase of my career. \n\nFucker. I am THISCLOSE to telling him it's over.",

Anytime I watch the video I just cringe because I was just doing this high pitch baby talk saying the same thing over and over, told him it\u2019s okay mommy\nIs here you don\u2019t have to cry ( to which the nurse said no it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s crying, and I knew that, I just couldn\u2019t think straight) I watch the video back and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even remember half of it.

I wish I had been more calm and present during the actual birth, but honestly it was just coping with the fact that it was so much more painful than I ever could\u2019ve prepared for. At the end of the day, the doctors and nurses have seen everything and you won\u2019t regret documenting, even if it\u2019s imperfect. 3 months moved on, I think back on it fondly, and hopefully soon you can too. \u2764\ufe0f",

My boyfriend and I have a house that our friends moved into about a few months ago, they have their own baby, (for context their LO is 15mo and my LO is 9mo) so our two babies sleep in the extra room together. I never had any trouble with waking up until around the time they moved in. I don't know if it's a combination of getting used to another baby's cries and my medication, or what. I just recently started taking lamotrigine and fluoxetine, and I feel like they're causing me to be a heavy sleeper. I never had any problems when I was just taking fluoxetine, but since adding lamotrigine I sleep like a rock and I'm constantly drowsy. Our housemates are having problems with our baby waking up so much earlier than their baby, and I don't wake up every time my baby does. \n\nI'm a teen mom, I got pregnant at 16, gave birth at 17, and am now 18. I recently cut off my own mom, and I don't have any other mother figures to ask questions like this. I love my baby more than anything in the world, and I feel like I don't deserve her. \n\nDoes anyone else have an expirence like this? What do I do? Does this make me a bad mom? \n\nPlease feel free to ask clarifying questions, I'm very stressed out right now and I don't know if I've explained everything properly. \n\nEDIT: I didn't clarify, but I'm not sleeping in super late, I don't think. I'm usually up 6:00-7:45, It's just that my baby can wake up an hour earlier than I end up waking up at. ",

Then discussing if there\u2019s literally any other options. If you\u2019re a SAHM and the sole caregiver for your baby basically (since your husband works a lot), I wouldn\u2019t feel safe being always drowsy and not waking up to my baby. That would be enough for me to rule out that medication entirely, to be frank. Unless they insist that side effect wears off after x weeks or something.",

Both of our housemates have jobs and we split bills 50/50, my boyfriend's name is on the deed. I'm not sure of the etiquette for these kinds of things. I know it's hard on them because they do have work. I think I'm just at a loss here.",

I'm her primary caregiver, but there are usually people home throughout the day, and if not, I'm completely alone with her for about three hours at max. The drowsiness isn't the problem, and I definitely can power through it. If anything, I feel even more capable and motivated to be the best mom I can be for my baby. It's mostly waking up that is the issue. I saw another comment on here that suggested talking to my Dr. about alternatives, so I'm definitely going to try that! But I would not be taking this medication if my baby wasn't safe or I didn't feel I could take care of her throughout the whole day.",

I'm the only unemployed person in the house, and I really do feel like the least I can do is just wake up when she does. My doctor has said that my specific medication combo can cause drowsiness and can cause me to sleep heavily, which was originally a good thing because I have insomnia. This is also the only medication combo that's been working for me so far. I might try switching up the time of day that I take them at.",

I have to have a lot of noise and light to fall asleep, so I'm afraid that would keep her awake and none of us would get any sleep. I'm not sure how moving her back into our room will go, because she'll have to readjust to the lights and sound. How big of a problem would something like that be?"
