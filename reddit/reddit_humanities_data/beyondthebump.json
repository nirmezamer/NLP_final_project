            "I do 99% of the night baby care and I\u2019m so so full of rage and resentment lately as my baby\u2019s nights have been absolute shit. And my partner has the audacity to complain he\u2019s tired and got no sleep because of some back pain and meanwhile he\u2019s had 10 uninterrupted hours.. meanwhile I\u2019m up at 11, 12, 3, 5, and up for the day at 7. What the fuck?",
            "I'm enjoying the slower pace of life being on maternity leave. I walk my toddler to nursery, I walk the dog, I see friends, I play with my baby and go to baby classes, I keep the house ticking over and do a bit of gardening subject to my baby being asleep or happy to play in her jumperoo.  I EBF and I'm grateful for the time to do that. \n\nI enjoy not having a commute, dealing with work politics, demanding clients, juggling housework, kids and work... you know the drill. Going back to work, I worry a bit about that but I'll cope.\n\n\nMy partner, smirked at me and said going back to work is going to be a shock to the system for me. \n\nTrue facts... I got my first job aged 17. I've been working longer than he has. I work damn hard when I work. On one hand I'm looking forward to going back. I'm going to start studying for the next level of professional qualifications. I feel in my groove and very confident in my abilities and am looking forward to working towards the next phase of my career. \n\nFucker. I am THISCLOSE to telling him it's over.",
            "Mine does the same and it fills me with so much rage when he'll complain he didn't sleep well or had to wake up early and only got 8 or 9 hours of sleep. Ok...I've been sleeping in 2-4 hours increments for nearly 7 months and often going multiple days in a row where I've only gotten at most 2 hours of sleep, but goodness forbid that my husband wake up before 7am",
            "WHY DO ALL MEN DO THIS! There should be some kind of pre-pregnancy checklist or class where MALE PARTNERS are warned to never ever say shit like this. This is grounds for murder IMO. I almost killed my husband in the newborn stage for these comments",
            "YES YES YES YES. Currently sitting here filled with rage because my partner walked in the door of our hotel room for our weekend vacation and fell dead asleep without even bothering to say \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap\u201d or \u201cis it okay if I take a quick nap?\u201d Meanwhile, I have been up with baby EVERY NIGHT for his whole life, woke up this morning and got baby ready, packed for all three of us, made baby\u2019s bottles and fed him on the drive down here, changed his diapers, everything. So I\u2019m like \u201cokay, guess I\u2019m on baby duty AGAIN\u201d and it\u2019s like he can just fall asleep because he knows everything is handled and baby will be taken care of. I adore him and he\u2019s great with our son but damn, being the default parent is exhausting.\u00a0",

Firstly because they've seen it all and you've just been through one of the most intense experiences of your life. Secondly because nothing you said was cringe-worthy. They do that job specifically for those moments. A mother meeting her baby for the first time? Amazing!

I wish I had been more calm and present during the actual birth, but honestly it was just coping with the fact that it was so much more painful than I ever could\u2019ve prepared for.

We received two 'sneak peaks' from the photographer the day after the session that were photos of our daughter on her own. They were beautiful and we are so happy with how they turned out.\n\nAnyways, my MIL responded to my Instagram story the other day and I noticed that she had updated her profile photo to a photo of our 18-month old's entire daycare CLASS. I was shocked and I told my husband to ask her to take it down because we didn't have consent to share the photos of the other children on a public platform. He did and she reportedly changed it. \n\nToday, however, I noticed that she had uploaded our daughter's professional close-up as a profile picture on Instagram and FB. I immediately felt a pit in my stomach because I have been avoiding posting clear images of our child's face on my private IG account and I had not shared these professional photos at all because I was uncomfortable with it. Only to see that it had already been posted as a PUBLIC profile photo in ultra HD resolution close-up of my child's features. \n\nI messaged my MIL and politely told her that I understand she is proud of her granddaughter, but I haven't shared that photo because I don't feel comfortable with sharing my daughter's face online. I asked her to take it down and she did. \n\nI still have a sick feeling because I feel like my child has been put in danger.  I feel like I no longer have any control over where that photo has gone even though it has been removed. \n\nEdit:\n\nWow, this post got more attention than I anticipated. It was more of a vent for my anxious energy, but I appreciate all of the comments that have created a discussion around the risk of social media sharing. \n\nI acknowledge that I'm an anxious person at baseline, but my anxiety is not unfounded here. My daughter has also received some attention when we go outside to public spaces where people have approached us and asked to take her photo because (and I quote - from a male perfect stranger) \"she's so beautiful\". This has happened on two separate occasions. We declined both times, but it certainly made me feel uneasy. \n\nI think these experiences have made me more aware of how strangers might perceive my child to be an object for their own gratification. I also stopped sharing all photos of her face 6 months ago. There were newborn to 8 month face photos that have been removed from a private Instagram account. She's never been posted anywhere publicly until the above incident.\n\nWe are planning to have a discussion with my MIL about boundaries and I thank you for all your comments that will be contributing to talking points in that discussion.",

            "Hi - cyber security consultant here.\n\nYour child is NOT in active danger. Posting your child on social media never puts them in active danger unless there are also location based clues/tags. Now, they could be in passive danger of child porno but the reality is that is likely rare.\n\nYou need to understand that ANY photo taken of your child with a digital camera likely poses a similar risk to posting your child on a private social media page. Shared cloud based storage is one giant weak link when it comes to data protection and photographers are constantly storing and sharing folders and files.\n\nYou should also VERY carefully read any photography contract to ensure your images can not be used to marketing purposes if you\u2019re so concerned, just FYI",
            "Your child wasn\u2019t put in danger. I can understand not wanting the photo posted publicly, but the odds that, in the short amount of time the photo was up, someone took that photo and used it in a manner that puts your child in danger is basically none. I think anxiety is causing you to overestimate the risk in this situation. \n\nYou\u2019re valid in being upset, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be valid in having continued worry, fear, and anxiety over this situation. I would definitely refrain from digitally sharing photos with MIL in the future, though.",
            "Your MIL absolutely shouldn\u2019t have done this without your permission, but it\u2019s not normal to feel sick or feel like your child is in danger just because their photo is on someone else\u2019s social media. \n\nReddit especially likes to overemphasise the actual risk to having children\u2019s face on the internet. If you go on the website of the photographer, they\u2019ll probably have loads of sample images of children for their gallery. Do you worry that all those children are in danger? Do you feel sick when other friends of yours upload photos of themselves and their children? It\u2019s all well and good to try to keep your child\u2019s photo off the internet, but you need to keep in mind that there are hundreds of thousands of photos of babies and children available on the internet and the overwhelming majority of them have never been put in danger because of it.",
            "Photographer and former school social media manager here! So I go over this risk with my clients. I don\u2019t charge extra for privacy (not posting their photos to my portfolio/on my social media) but I do charge for a flash drive. \n\nWhen I take photos as a professional, those photos are backed up to at least 2 different locations on my end, but usually four. Two are physical drives, two are cloud based. One of those is a general cloud storage and one is the gallery that I gave the client access to. The reason I say \u201cat least 2\u201d is because I offer clients physical delivery via flash drive if they pay to get the flash drive to me and back to them. And not one client concerned with privacy has ever actually done that. \n\nAs I explain in-contract, I can (and do) password protect/hide private galleries. I cannot, however, guarantee that the company that hosts those photos won\u2019t have a security breach.  I can\u2019t guarantee my cloud storage system won\u2019t be penetrated by malicious individuals. And, I can\u2019t confirm your own safety. If you use a silly password for your email account, someone can gain access to your photos. If you\u2019re storing photos unsafely on your own devices, someone can gain access to your photos. \n\nBut for most people, their concern is a physical footprint of their child online from before the child can consent. It\u2019s not an issue of security. The only people, when I worked at a school, who were concerned about their kids being posted were families in custody battles and foster kids. We had two students whose parents chose to simply refrain because of the footprint issue. \n\nPeople on here say that you aren\u2019t having your photo taken every day when you walk outside your door, but you absolutely can be. \n\n- Camera doorbells: notoriously hacked (again likely a password issue) and give information on where you live. Doesn\u2019t have to be yours, just has to be one you walk up to or even past depending on distance/sensitivity \n\n- CCTV footage: People don\u2019t know this if they haven\u2019t worked in it for some reason, but you can download clips of security footage (let alone the fact you can screen record). Anyone can take home footage of anyone. \n\nOther people\u2019s cellphones: I am sure most people do not have any way of knowing when they\u2019re in the background of a photo because so many people think they\u2019re in a photo when I\u2019m out shooting professionally and they\u2019re literally nowhere in my range of sight. The likelihood that you\u2019re in someone\u2019s video/photo out there is pretty high. \n\nBaby monitors: again, almost always a password issue over anything else\n\nWeb cams: and some hackers can even turn off the light to let you know the computer is recording \n\nThere is so much data out there and so much opportunity. \n\nCan weird people screenshot a photo off of a private page? Absolutely. Is posting a photo of your child\u2019s first day of school sign a bad idea if it lists the exact school and their full name? Yes. Should we be mindful of our kids\u2019 online presence? Of course! Should we try and avoid posting photos of ourselves on vacation until we get home so people aren\u2019t trying to rob our house (this is a genuine thing that came up in an internet safety course I took)? Sure. \n\nThere are so many preventative measures, but there are risks regardless of what steps you take to mitigate them. \n\nI think your MIL was absolutely in the wrong here on both cases, but I think you need to put in perspective that there are other ways that bad people can get data.  Do not make yourself worried sick over this fact. Have a conversation with your MIL about the footprint you\u2019re trying to mitigate here. Hopefully she catches the drift. But you can\u2019t make yourself sick with where technology has taken us. We all just have to come to terms with its power in our own ways.",
            "First of all, I disagree with the idea that posting your child's picture online is putting them in danger. I think there's no more danger in doing this than in going out in public. But this is what happens when you post something online- you lose control over it. You say your Instagram is private, but even \"private\" spaces online are still online. No matter who you think you're sharing your pictures with, there is always the chance it will manage to break containment. So, while I understand being upset that your MIL is doing this (and I think you've handled it well), I think this is just the inherent nature of the internet.\n\nConsider another hypothetical- a different follower, still someone you know and are on good terms with, could have saved it (for any number of normal reasons, like to show a friend) and you would have no idea if they weren't as blatant about it as your MIL. Would that worry you? If you were to somehow find that someone else you don't know had seen that picture, how would you feel?",
            "As others have pointed out, your daughter\u2019s image is going to be out there in some way, either from other parents sharing daycare photos, security footage, being in the background of other photos, etc. Your MIL has taken it down and now (hopefully) knows better for the future. \n\nYou\u2019ve controlled what you can, so try to let it go.",
            "All the concerns aside\u2026 it\u2019s super weird to post photos of the other people as your profile photo.  Never understood that.",
            "You're overreacting.",
            "So I\u2019m not sure if I missed something or if you left it out, but was this not announced during the pregnancy? Have you already clearly communicated you didn\u2019t want this? Also I feel like the opportunity to let her understand your concerns was when your husband had her take the first one down. I wouldn\u2019t have blamed it on other kids, it\u2019s your rules which is fine but being open and honest might\u2019ve prevented it in the first place?",
            "Can someone explain why people are censoring their baby's faces or why someone would think a picture of their baby would put it in danger?\nI understand not posting without parents consent tho! And not posting until the child is old enough to consent if you are into that. But I don't understand the blurring of only babies and such."

I feel very angry and frustrated all the time. If it\u2019s with him, it\u2019s usually over not super important things, I\u2019m just always overstimulated and overwhelmed.\n\nWe both have expressed we feel under appreciated. He works all day while I take care of our son, he comes home, I go to work from 6pm-10pm. We are so behind on housework right now (we try to split it somewhat evenly, I have a tad bit more to do) and it\u2019s adding to my stress. He also feels like I don\u2019t think he knows what he\u2019s doing because when he\u2019s taking care of our son, I ask him lots of questions over text (i.e.  has he eaten? when did he nap? did you make sure it wasn\u2019t too hot? did you use the diaper cream?) and I understand that it must be annoying. I just am so new to being away from our baby and am constantly feeling anxious over him.\n\nWe aren\u2019t intimate, which is my fault because I barely even want to be hugged, let alone even THINK about sex. He isn\u2019t pushy about it, but it\u2019s definitely a source of his frustration with me. I get annoyed with physical affection right now and I feel so guilty.\n\nI exclusively pump (which is so mentally draining) and also get up with my son by myself most nights because my husband drives for his job and I made the choice myself that I would rather him get sleep so he\u2019s safe. However, there are nights I do want help and I am met with a lot of resistance when I try to wake him.\n\nI just always feel so irritated with him. I think a big part is just that I feel like I\u2019m doing so much more than he is. Even though realistically, I know we just have different responsibilities and he\u2019s doing just as much in other areas. \n\nSomeone please tell me it gets better. I remember getting pregnant and telling him, I don\u2019t want having a baby to change us and how we are with each other. That\u2019s so laughable to me now because we are two totally different people at this point. I love him so much, I just feel like all we do is bicker at this point. It\u2019s already so lonely becoming a parent, this certainly doesn\u2019t help. \ud83e\udd72",

            "I have 3 tips that may help a little bit \n\n1) Housework etc will just have to be last priority right now. I understand it sucks, especially since I myself am someone who gets stressed when it's messy, but you have to allow yourself some slack when you're both working and also taking care of a small baby \n\n2) Compliment each other! My fianc\u00e9 is SO good at complimenting me, and I've noticed how much it helps my self esteem, my feeling appreciated, and my appreciating him. It has also made me better at complimenting him as well, and I think it brings us closer. It's good to feel appreciated even for small things, even for things you feel is kinda like \"well of course it's expected that he does that\" - it's still nice to hear \"good job\" even if you're supposed to do the job anyway! \n\n3) Just try your best not to stick your nose too much in how he takes care of baby. I understand you're anxious having to be away from them, but it probably feels very overbearing that you kinda question his ability to take care of your (both of yours!) baby. Maybe ask if he could send some pictures or updates like that to you instead, so you maybe relax a bit since you can see baby is fine. As long as baby is fed, changed, and happy, it doesn't matter if he does it exactly the same way as you do. Just trust your husband and let go a little bit. Again, even if it's hard. I read a comment once about how it's better to have a blowout here and there because your partner puts the diaper on a little crooked, so they can learn to be parent in their own way, rather than making your partner feel less than and creating resentful feelings over things that doesn't really matter in the big picture. There will be occasional blowouts anyway!",
            "First of all, it really does get better. My baby is 12 months old now and a whole different kid than at 4mo. He's still demanding and intense and yells a lot but that's just his temperament. But it definitely got easier from 4mo - or I just adjusted.\n\nI often find myself in a similar situation, overstimulated and stressed and annoyed over small things. Afterwards I can usually tell that it probably wasn't even about my husband or the small thing, it was just the last straw when I was already at my limit. I try to tell him that often so he knows I still love him.\n\nWhat helps us stay connected is dedicating time to each other. Even if it's just one episode on the couch before going to sleep, or eating together. It doesn't have to lead to sex, just connection. \n\nAlso, pumping is so hard! I did for 6 months and it felt like a full time job. Would it be an option to drop a few pumps and possibly combo feed? I know I felt a huge weight off my chest with each pump I dropped. \n\nIf there is something you're struggling with especially, maybe there's a workaround for it? If it's cooking, meal prep could help. If it's cleaning the floors, a robot vacuum might be the right call. I struggled with the evening routine for a long time until my husband and I managed to organise it in a way that is most efficient for our family.\n\nIs there something specific where you feel like he's not doing enough? Where you feel like he's getting to chill while you run around, or something that's a shared chore that mostly you do, or something else? Maybe that would be a good starting point.",
            "It gets better as others said. I also went through something similar with my husband after having my first daughter (she was an extremely challenging baby and that only made things worse). \nWe were both doing our best, but it wasn\u2019t enough from my perspective because my hormones were all over the place.\nWith my second, it was way better (she was also an easier baby), and we argued much less.\nMy relationship definitely changed after our daughters, I think this is inevitable, but things are great now. My daughters are 6 years old and 19 months.\n\nOne piece of advice someone gave me was \u201cdon\u2019t be the expert parent\u201d, trust your husband as a father. I made the same mistake and it really affected my husband\u2019s self esteem with our first\u2026 plus this ended up turning me as the \u201cparent by default\u201d, which is something you don\u2019t want to turn into\u2026 and it takes a long time to reverse this situation\n\n\nGood luck!",
            "IT GETS BETTER. it gets soooo much better. omg I felt this way too in the beginning. I felt like I fell out of love with my husband. My baby is now 9mths and we are back to our normal selves. Started getting a lot better after 4 months. Don't stress. It is normal.",
            "It gets better. Our joke was *remember, the REAL enemy is the baby*",
            " hi friend, i hope you know you are a great mommy and you\u2019re doing an incredible job. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc im assuming you both are first time parents? have you considered couples counseling? everything you described is my husband and i. i told him that i needed us to go to counseling because i constantly felt like throwing the \u201cd\u201d word around (divorce). he agreed and though things have still been pretty tough we are sticking with it since we have only had 3 sessions thus far. having a baby is a huge transition! i think acknowledging each others work and compromising will ease a lot of tension that is going on right now. my husband is pretty stubborn so that\u2019s why i needed us to go to counseling. if your husband is easier to talk to, maybe sit him down and tell him how you\u2019re feeling. don\u2019t complete with each other and don\u2019t belittle one another. i hope it gets better for you both.",
            "It does get better. But as they say, it takes 2 to make a cycle and 1 to break it. (Not entirely true, if the cycle is due to things totally beyond your control, but you know what I mean). It can be really hard when what you need to say and do for eachother always feels out of reach because of exhaustion or resentment, leaving you both braced, and unwilling to be vulnerable or make any bids for connection. \n\nMy advice would be to write a note or an email - something short and sweet, like \"I am sorry we aren't getting along. I feel exhausted and overwhelmed all of the time, and unappreciated. But I know you're working so hard too, and probably feel similarly.\" And consider if there are little routines you can do each day like a long hug or a snuggle in bed to tide yourselves over and comfort one another until you have more space and time for connection. Also, my husband and I went a long time without true intercourse but we did a lot with our hands and it meant a lot to us both.",
            "I\u2019m on #3 and the first year postpartum is just as hard as it was the first time! I totally resonate with everything you wrote.\u00a0\n\nA couple ways of framing things that have helped me:\n1. Parenting is made up of a million micro skills. Whoever is the primary caregiver gets more practice and builds these skills more quickly which makes it seem like they have some innate knowledge or parenting ability which they/I don\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to make knowing what baby needs look effortless when you get 80-90% of the baby time. This helps me have more grace for my partner when he asks me questions or doesn\u2019t seem to be able to take care of baby as smoothly or efficiently. He is doing his best. Some guys weaponize incompetence but not mine and it doesn\u2019t sound like yours either.\u00a0\n\n2. It often feels easier to just go about my day without my partner because it\u2019s one less variable. Then he\u2019s thrown into the weekend mix and there is more chaos because the routine changes. Making him explicitly aware of my daily routine with the kids by writing it down helps us be on the same page instead of fighting because I feel like he isn\u2019t helping with things at the right time when he doesn\u2019t even realize I have an expectation there.\u00a0\n\n3. Mindfully accepting that a bomb just got thrown into my life, and we\u2019re both figuring it out together. I think there can be a lot of pressure to \u201cfix it\u201d in this stage when sometimes just accepting that you\u2019re in a temporary roommate phase and doing your best is just the way it is. The resistance of wishing it were different makes me more upset than the actual situation.\u00a0\n\n4. Set times for \u201cstate of the union\u201d discussions. Once a day, once a week, whatever works for you. Try to have a business meeting when you need to then leave some discussion time open for lighter, more interesting, not work/family related stuff.\u00a0\n\n5. Do whatever you need to to make\nHousekeeping less tedious and more efficient . Buy a steam\u00a0Cleaner, get laundry baskets you can carry with one hand, stop folding things, etc. I can\u2019t tell if or how much of a difference giving up folding 90% of\nMy laundry has made.\u00a0\n\n6. Probably unpopular, but consider formula\nFeeding or combo feeding. This makes a HUGE difference in how I feel about the equity of our parenting load.\u00a0",

            "Hello. I have a seven month old and I have found when I get like this it\u2019s because I feel like I\u2019m doing too much and I feel like I\u2019m overwhelmed. The best thing I have found that helps is talking with my husband. We both want a good relationship and we\u2019re both willing to do anything so that helps to be in the state of mind during these conversations. Sometimes, you have to step back though and see that yes you\u2019re doing everything but so is he. We sit down and go over the I\u2019m doing these tasks, and he tells me what tasks he\u2019s doing. Usually we see there isn\u2019t a whole lot of room for a break, so we\u2019ll switch up the tasks. That way we\u2019re not both stuck doing the same things every day. The middle of the night feedings should be split. If he can take one, when you ask, that will be extremely helpful. My husband actually does the one my LO has and if he wakes me up I get really pissed. But, if he asks me before bed if I can get up, I can mentally prepare myself so maybe ask if he can help with one? And then let him ahead that you need him to take a specific one. Lastly, the intimacy - you have to get over this bump. It\u2019s like getting back on a horse after you\u2019ve fallen off, you won\u2019t want to but you NEED to. Start with hugs and focus on just enjoying it, like you used to. Not how you don\u2019t want to. You have walls up right now like a puffed up little cat, you have to bring them down and welcome him to be your safe space again. Let him know you\u2019re going to work on these things and tell him what you need from him. He\u2019ll appreciate the physical affection and then build on it. Step out of your head and your feelings and take a deep breath and move forward. You WILL feel better."
