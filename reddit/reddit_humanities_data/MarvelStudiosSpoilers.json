            "2024 is probably going to be the best year for superhero animation *ever*. \n\n*Invincible* season 2, *X-Men \u201897*, *My Adventures with Superman* season 2, *Suicide Squad Isekai*, *Batman: Caped Crusader*, *Creature Commandos*, *Eyes of Wakanda* and possibly even *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* as well.",

            "I feel like Avengers 5 is going to be a lot like Infinity War with everything going on. Sam will probably have his earth based team set up at that point (no I do not believe that Alex Perez tweet about Wong coming in to recruit Sam considering it was pretty clear in hindsight that AtlantaFilming was just speculating because Benedict was in Atlanta at the time), with Strange being confirmed his side is coming in as well, Wong has his team with Shang-Chi, Katy, Hulk and Carol.",
            "This might sound weird, but I feel like X-Men \u201897 portrayed Magento too favorably. Done get me wrong, it\u2019s a good portrayal, because a lot of people haven\u2019t watched the original series or read the comics, they\u2019re  forgetting that this man openly calls for genocide on people he deems genetically inferior. He is in no ways a good guy. He\u2019s Hitler if Hitler was created by Hitler and used that as a justification for his genocide. \n\nThe worst thing he does in \u201897 (disabling the power grid) is almost danced over. They don\u2019t deal with the fact that he almost certainly killed millions of innocent people. Every car in the world crashed; every plane fell out of the sky; everybody on life support immediately flatlined; and they just ignore it. So people spout unironically \u201cMagento was right\u201d as if he isn\u2019t completely insane.",
            "Reading Claremont/Cockrum's Uncanny X-Men run for the first time (really loving it). I'm surprised how much I like Banshee. He's the team's glass cannon: easy to take out in a fight, but his sonic blasts have more raw force than any other power on the team (until Phoenix appears).\n\nBanshee also acts as an older, world-weary rogue with a heart-of-gold: unafraid to call out Xavier/Cyclops' bullshit, but willing to die for his friends. This is normally Wolverine's role, but right now he's a trigger-happy psycho everyone hates. I'm guessing Banshee will eventually be written out of the book so Wolverine can grow into his role.\n\nI waffle a lot about wishcasting the MCU X-Men. But I wouldn't be disappointed if they just copied the Uncanny team: Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Banshee, and Wolverine. Really fun dynamic.",
            "I\u2019m sad about Blade no longer being set in the 1920\u2019s. Aside from being a cool aesthetic alongside the alternate universe 60\u2019s of the F4, since seeing the flashback in Eternals, I\u2019ve been very intrigued by the past of the MCU. \n\nHaving Blade set in the 1920\u2019s gave me the impression that they not only set up stuff for the future moving forward but also are building the historical past of the universe.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been cool to see an Eternal or 2 pop up in Blade, a crossover happening before we followed the MCU in the modern world. There was that tidbit about the Eternals having helped the previous Avatar of Khonshu take down Ammit\u2019s last avatar in the past but the idea was scrapped due to budget for Moon Knight. Which imho is unfortunate.",

            "While I enjoyed this season of *Doctor Who*, I can\u2019t help but feel it was too short. 9 episodes (counting the Christmas special) just isn\u2019t enough to get to know this Doctor and Ruby Sunday, compared to past seasons with ~13 episodes. That\u2019s an almost 3 hour difference. \n\nSo is it wrong for me to say that for some shows, I\u2019d rather have ~20 episodes seasons with lots of filler than 8, good episodes? For serialized shows (like Stranger Things) 8 episodes is plenty, but for episodic television like *Doctor Who* and *Star Trek*, 8-10 just isn\u2019t enough."

            "I\u2019m considering watching this. After my X-Men 97 high, I was wrestling with the fact that I hadn\u2019t seen the last few Fox X-Men movies.\u00a0\n\nMe? A lifelong X-Men fan has skipped several live-action films? How could I truly let this be? Sure, the reviews had turned me away but I love the X-Men and have to see for myself.\u00a0\n\n15 minutes into Dark Phoenix, I was rudely reminded of why I had abandoned the Fox X-Men universe, with few exceptions. There\u2019s a lot that feels off but the way Mystique takes center stage is just bizarre as a longtime fan. Primarily because it doesn\u2019t feel natural to the story, rather you can tell it\u2019s a star power thing.\n\nSo is Apocalypse better?",
            "Some action scenes were really cool (especially the Quicksilver scene) and some of the performances were pretty strong, Fassbender\u2019s being my favorite.\n\nMy big issue that the movie felt unfocused. I like when the X-Men don\u2019t have a *sole* lead, but it felt like many of the arcs didn\u2019t get much time to cook or get enough focus to feel satisfying. A lot of the time it feels like they\u2019re fighting for screentime (still think the Weapon X plot was unneeded).\n\nI will say though, there were some neat brief character moments like Kurt praying for Alex or Peter joking with the others on the plane or the deleted scenes with the young cast at the mall.",
            "The action scenes where amazing in this movie especially the magneto awakening one",
            "EVERYTHING THEY BUILT WILL FALL!",
            "- Wolverine should\u2019ve been one of the Horsemen and that\u2019s how he gets the adamantium and comic suit/ mask in the new timeline.\nMaking him the product of the Stryker\u2019s Weapon X program again fucks the significance of Stryker not being Stryker at the end of DoFP.\n\n- Giving the X-Men black armor that they randomly found at Alkali Lake was a braindead move. The movie was made in fucking 2016. They conveniently found a fancy black jet to go along with them too. \nThey should\u2019ve found a way to have them wear the comic suits from the end earlier in the film.\n\n- Apocalypse was too big a threat for newbie X-Men in the 1980s. \n\n- I love that we got back to back X-Men films with musical continuity.\n\n- This was somehow a better Mummy movie than the one that came the following year staring tom cruise",
            "This movie had so much potential and they fucked it up. The way Wolverine was included really pissed me the fuck off. Why even bother with the little tease of Mystique as Stryker at the end of DOFP? Obviously, the implication was new timeline, new rules. \n\nApocalypse should\u2019ve been the one that gave him the adamantium in this timeline. He didn\u2019t even need to be a major character, just a horseman, handled with meticulous care to ensure he\u2019s respected, but ensuring that the new characters get a chance to shine.",
            "This movie is rubbish, but has a couple of aspects that bring it up from F tier for me. \n\nMichael Fassbender is incredible, even if his story feels recycled. \n\nThe Quicksilver scene is fun but suffers from crazy tonal whiplash given that Havok dies in that scene. \n\nApocalypse is bad, though not as bad as Vuk. No villain is as bad as Vuk. \n\nThe best scene is the Wolverine scene, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense with the ending of DOFP and that whole section of the movie feels inconsequential and out of no where.",
            "the horsemen should have been first class members so basically magneto, mystique, beast and alex summers\n\nI get angel is a known horseman but he's barely developed here I'd rather have him join the team",
            "There's a scene in this where magneto psychically talks to Charles and in the background Apocalypse is using his powers to put armor on archangel, full body, while psylocke stands next to him without pants. The movie has the worst costuming in the franchise the biggest issue of course being Apocalypse himself.\u00a0 Sort of an ugly sonic situation:\u00a0 everyone told them it was bad when it was revealed but they went ahead with it any way. The movie continues the worst I clinations of the franchise which is to include X-Men characters as like a checklist but without actually including anything meaningful about their characters or personalities.\u00a0 It's especially sad when it comes to nightcrawler, who actually does look great in this, but can't come close to matching the heart alan cumming brought to the role.",
            "Uh. Jean uses the whole Phoenix thing against Apocalypse at the end, but in the next film, she dosen't seem have any of that going on until the incident with the space shuttle? Uh, ok."

It's on par next year for how much I'm looking forward to Deadpool & Wolverine this year.",
