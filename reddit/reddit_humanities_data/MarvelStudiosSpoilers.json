            "In the Superman set photos, Mr. Terrific has the LordTech logo on his shirt. This is interesting, because it implies Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn) is sponsoring superheroes, like how in the comics he sponsored the Justice League International. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Mr. Terrific, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Metamorpho are all members of a corporate sponsored Justice League, like the Seven from the Boys.",
            "Post Secret Wars what do you guys think the new film franchises will be in the MCU?\u00a0\n\nObviously X-Men is the major one. Could we get an Iron Man reboot? New cosmic franchise?\u00a0",
            "Its sad how Cable and Domino arent in Deadpool and Wolverine. Maybe they can return in a Deadpool 4 or something.",
            "Finally watched \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" and that movie was a damn blast. Guy Ritchie is just on a roll.\n\nThe whole cast was fantastic and I want them all in the MCU lmao. Especially Eiza Gonzalez, but I can't think of someone she can play off the top of my head.",
            "I know how it goes, 'don't get your hopes up' and all that, but if David Harewood's playing >!Plagueis!< in The Acolyte, I'll absolutely freak out. I was always a fan of the idea of the character, but having >!read the novel a little bit ago, I think there's a fair amount of overlap where it would make sense for him to be present and, while the story could go in any other direction, I'm still hoping he has *something* to do with what's going on. I've just been dying to see the guy in live-action for the last little bit.!<",
            "Reading stuff like Animal Man and Sweet Tooth recently, Jeff Lemire legit deserves a second chance at a proper mainline X-book. Him coming in to write the X-Men at basically the rock bottom era of the team and basically anything mutant-related did him so dirty despite the fact that Extraordinary X-Men was serviceable enough with the circumstances surrounding it, especially ideas like turning the X-Mansion into a safe haven for mutants during M-Pox and how he handled Emma Frost during Death of X\n\nDude can really fly with character work based on those books at DC and especially how absolutely top tier his Moon Knight run was with Greg Smallwood. A Lemire/Smallwood X-Men run would pop off so hard",
            "Here we are a year later and im still happy crying over Volume 3",
            "Every time the \u201cWho asked for this?!\u201d shit pops up I just think of that Gunn quote about how nobody asked for The Sopranos or Star Wars either. It\u2019s such a dumb way of evaluating art. There\u2019s a bunch of stuff I have zero interest in, but I\u2019d rarely make the argument it shouldn\u2019t exist."

            "The action scenes where amazing in this movie especially the magneto awakening one",
            "EVERYTHING THEY BUILT WILL FALL!",
            "This movie had so much potential and they fucked it up. The way Wolverine was included really pissed me the fuck off. Why even bother with the little tease of Mystique as Stryker at the end of DOFP? Obviously, the implication was new timeline, new rules. \n\nApocalypse should\u2019ve been the one that gave him the adamantium in this timeline. He didn\u2019t even need to be a major character, just a horseman, handled with meticulous care to ensure he\u2019s respected, but ensuring that the new characters get a chance to shine.",
            "There's a scene in this where magneto psychically talks to Charles and in the background Apocalypse is using his powers to put armor on archangel, full body, while psylocke stands next to him without pants. The movie has the worst costuming in the franchise the biggest issue of course being Apocalypse himself.\u00a0 Sort of an ugly sonic situation:\u00a0 everyone told them it was bad when it was revealed but they went ahead with it any way. The movie continues the worst I clinations of the franchise which is to include X-Men characters as like a checklist but without actually including anything meaningful about their characters or personalities.\u00a0 It's especially sad when it comes to nightcrawler, who actually does look great in this, but can't come close to matching the heart alan cumming brought to the role.",
            "Uh. Jean uses the whole Phoenix thing against Apocalypse at the end, but in the next film, she dosen't seem have any of that going on until the incident with the space shuttle? Uh, ok.",
            "Oh man this movie is wack, Apocalypse is a boring villain, the writing is not that great, so many recognizable Mutants gets wasted especially Psylocke, and the story is so cookie cutter.\nHeck I don\u2019t even liked the casting of Jean since it just the actress didn\u2019t feel right for the role.",
            "This movie is the second worst thing associated with Bryan Singer.",
            "it still bothers me that quiksilver didnt tell magneto he is his son",
            "Evan Peters is thr 1 thing I enjoyed.",
            "This is such an average movie, the pacing and the action scenes make it a fun watch and the third act is really entertaining but script and the whole storytelling itself is just bad imo."
