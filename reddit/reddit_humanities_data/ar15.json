Can anyone explain this? \nYou\u2019re not mounting an optic or laser to it, so it doesn\u2019t require THAT level of precision (yes, obviously you want it to stay put, but I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019d need it to be any more stable than something like a QD mount or a light mount \u2014 both very stable but it\u2019s ok if there\u2019s a very very slight shift). If it\u2019s some kind of rare, precious metal they use, then I\u2019ve got to think they could find something else that will hold up to abuse (there\u2019s plenty of other brands that hold up great).\nAnyways, I love the design, so I hope they do bring the price down, because $100 almost seems like someone high up made a bet that they could get people to pay a silly amount of money for something ridiculous.
