Eventually I\u2019d like to replace the upper, optic, and suppressor, for now it\u2019s not in the budget. Should probably get a new charging handle as well. \n\nI\u2019m not concerned about appearance. As of now, the brace is staying on until my AW cert comes through. \n\nTLDR: want to upgrade purely for reliability\u2019s sake. This is a do all rifle. ",

            "Reliability wise you should be completely fine with the current setup. If you have an Aero Bcg, It's probably fine if you've sent a few hundred rounds with no issue but you could always get a microbest or a KAK down vent (KAK being a gas upgrade as well). Other than that, a trigger and a new grip will be the biggest and best upgrades as far as performance and general ergonomics.",
            "Nothing if it shoots fine. Maybe a different pistol grip and trigger guard.\n\nBCM Gunfighter Mod 3, Irregular Defense, B5 Type 22, Reptilia grip. And the Magpul aluminum or KAC extended trigger guard. Better grip angle and more room, but not super necessary.",

Can anyone explain this? \nYou\u2019re not mounting an optic or laser to it, so it doesn\u2019t require THAT level of precision (yes, obviously you want it to stay put, but I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019d need it to be any more stable than something like a QD mount or a light mount \u2014 both very stable but it\u2019s ok if there\u2019s a very very slight shift). If it\u2019s some kind of rare, precious metal they use, then I\u2019ve got to think they could find something else that will hold up to abuse (there\u2019s plenty of other brands that hold up great).\nAnyways, I love the design, so I hope they do bring the price down, because $100 almost seems like someone high up made a bet that they could get people to pay a silly amount of money for something ridiculous.
