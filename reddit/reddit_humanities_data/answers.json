It's okay to pursue things you want but don't need, just be absolutely clear with yourself that that's what you're doing.\n\nMaximize your 401(k).\n\nKeep your phone for as long as possible (5-7 years) or until it's absolutely broken.\n\nKeep your car for as long as possible (15-20 years). Encountering a repair that's \"more expensive than the car is worth\" is not a reason to buy a new car. A $3,000 repair on a 10 year old car can extend its utility by a couple years. That's much cheaper than two years of car payments.",
