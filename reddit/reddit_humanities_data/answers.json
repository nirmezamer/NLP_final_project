KIf there is neither or just a web form for contact, I will usually steer clear or look elewhere for the product.  If its the only place to get it though then regardless of the value of the product, if its a company I've never used or heard of before, I will always pay using a credit card as we have Section 75 of the consumer credit act (UK) to fall back on if the company fails to deliver - section 75 ensures the credit card company is jointly liabnle if something goes wrong (they are paying on your behalf)  Only after a first transaction would I then consider using another form of payment for further transactions.",
