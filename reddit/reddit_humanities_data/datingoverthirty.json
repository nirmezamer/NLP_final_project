It's been really nice and I think we both really like each other. \n\nIn a lot of my past relationships, I was always anxious. I don't feel anxious with her.",

They texted me that there was no romantic chemistry for him </3  :( \n\nIt makes me just want to give up on the whole endeavor of dating.... but I also realize that's \"catastrophic\" thinking and to not just stop\n\nOh well.

For god\u2019s sake just feed me some platitude that you weren\u2019t feeling it and just let me move on!\n\nI feel like a failure.

Do I want to hug them? Do their words match their actions? Do I like their character?\n\nAttraction needs to be there from the start. I don't see the point going on a date with someone I (personally) don't find attractive. \n\nDesire is something that grows over time as I get to know them. And as they get to know me..",

You eventually realize that you don't want to have children with them because you figure out that the relationship will not last (emotionally abusive, sexually incompatible, etc) and you don't want split custody down the line.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this can take a year or more to learn or come to terms with. You break up and you take some time to yourself to heal and figure out what you want and don't want. Another year or so passes and you date again. You meet someone, you ignore the little feelings in your gut because you fall in love and you try to work through them. You battle with the idea of settling or finding someone who doesn't bring out these feelings in you. You power through only to realize you should have listened to your gut in the first place. You learned the hard way and despite the love you have for the person and the work you've done, know that you're not satisfied with your life and want something else. Maybe it's the person or maybe it's the direction your life is going in. Maybe you wish you were a different person and this person is a scapegoat.

It wasn't drugs, it was an undiagnosed genetic predisposition that manifested in my late teens. This started at the end of high school and persisted for about 12 years. The treatment was very intense and left me with amnesia. I have almost no living memory of most of those twelve years. For example, I have no memory of 9/11.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI am much better now and there is no risk of the situation I was in occurring again. However, it has left me out of sync between my biological age and experiential age. Biologically, I am in my forties. Experientially, I am in my early thirties. I have found it very difficult to navigate the dating scene with this as a truth about myself. There have been more than a few judgmental interactions on dates that boiled down to something along the lines of, \"but what's really wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\n\nIt's disheartening because I have put in so much work to climb out of the hole I was in. I went to college. I have multiple degrees. I have good job and have become a respected member of the community. I think I have a lot to offer in a relationship. However, my career is not as far along as many of those in their forties. I am working on my PhD part-time in the hope of becoming a tenured instructor at a university.

            "The closest experience I've had to this was when I was seeing someone and he was affectionate physically on his own like he enjoyed holding hands and hugs and being close physically. Then he one night told me he's not an affectionate person after I reached for his hand and he pulled away. I must have looked at him like he had two heads because he quickly said he wasn't raised to be like that. I was confused because he was like that on his own without me prompting it. I felt like he was faking it because maybe he thought that's what I wanted and he really didn't, but he never said a word until that one night a few months in. \n\nAll this to say...has she experienced a change in her personal or professional life? Did she maybe think this is what you wanted and ultimately she was doing it to make you happy? Definitely have a conversation about it with her. I also wonder if it's just something where some people \"drop the act\" after a little while because most (not all) come with a facade of someone who they want to be in a relationship or who they think the other person wants them to be. Not saying this is her...primarily thinking out loud here.",

I was angry but didn\u2019t say anything, matched his effort so ignored him as much as he ignored me, he then panicked I guess and started reaching out a lot, but a few days later he started pulling back again. Hot and cold, like you said. I then learned that he was losing his attraction and was feeling attracted to other women. I wonder how long I would put up with it if he didn\u2019t willingly say it to me, I might\u2019ve lost more time. I agree with the ones suggesting to have a talk about this.\n\nWe broke up but he wants to get back together. I understand feeling too comfortable in a long term relationship and losing attraction a bit but 2 months felt too early for someone to feel that about me, so I won\u2019t take that offer. Your relationship is long enough to start being in that territory, but the change is sharp enough to bother you, so it\u2019s worth it to have a serious talk about it. Your needs matter (telling this to myself too as I tend to ignore my needs in a relationship).",
            "After reading through your comments, it seems like you're generally happy with the relationship still, just a bit confused at the change which is reasonable.\n\nTo me it sounds like you've exited the NRE (new relationship energy) period and have sort of settled into your comfortable states. The way you show affection just seems to be different which is okay and perfectly as long as everyone stays communicative and is getting their needs met. NRE is a powerful drug! It's natural to be extra forward or giddy about your partner in ways that are unsustainable long-term, which is why it's important not to base expectations for the relationship solely off of the NRE phase.\n\nEchoing others, sit down and have a talk with her, and be firm with what you need. Also be sure to be honest with YOURSELF in terms of your needs! You definitely don't want to agree to something now that will make you resentful later, and the same goes for her.\n\nBest of luck OP, and I hope the best for both of you regardless of how the relationship goes!",
            "Sit down and have a conversation about how you're feeling and how she's feeling. Talk about your relationship and anything that is impacting her. Does she have life stuff going on? Does she need a break from the relationship. Is she losing interest. Could be anything. You just need to ask her and sit and talk.",
            "Could be a case of love bombing or partner having other priorities and has stepped off the cloud 9 of the honeymoon period",
            "Mine was very similar. She gave so much love, affection, and caring. I brought it up 2 times just making sure we were good because there was a very dramatic change. Couple weeks after she said she wasn\u2019t ready for my love and wanted to figure her life out. \n\nThat drastic change fucked with me so much, it\u2019s truly so painful from seeing how much love and interest someone can give and then they show you the complete opposite. \n\nHope you guys can talk it out.",
            "Interested to see where this goes. Sorry you're going through this OP, haven't dealt with this situation myself but the bottom line is that enthusiasm and reciprocity are everything. The sudden change in energy is upsetting. I hope there isn't something nefarious going on with her."
