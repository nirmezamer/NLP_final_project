So I gave one to her and she loved it, said some of the songs on there reminded her of things she listened to as a teenager. We had a nice conversation where there was clearly a flirty vibe(!) and in this conversation she tells me that she makes music. This got me really excited because I love creative types. I left off the conversation with telling her to send me some of her songs because I wanted to hear them. Yesterday, another mixtape shows up on my desk and one of the songs was one of hers. It was under a different name than hers, but I instantly recognized her voice. So when she came in to work I talked to her for a bit, told her it was a cute pseudonym, and she smiled and told me the story of where it came from. Ive left another mixtape on her desk today. I am thinking Ill ask her out soon. ",

However, I immediately know if I'm unattracted or repulsed by someone. Does the thought of this person going in for a kiss or in the throws of passion put you off? If so, you have your answer. If there's something about him that interests you and makes you want to keep seeing him, and you enjoy your time together, then continue.",
            "when I was single I tried to give any woman at least two dates but if I wasnt feeling it after that Id politely tell them I wasnt interested \n\nI dont really believe you can force it. Either its someone you are excited to see again or not. If not, might not be worth investigating why because it could be any combo of reasons. But after 2-3 dates I think its best to stop wasting both of yalls time if youre not feeling it",
            "I think if youre asking, you already know the answer. Most people can usually tell if they like someone within the first few minutes of meeting them. \n\nIf youre not curious about this guy, if the thought of hanging out with him alone or making out doesnt excite you then let things end here and move on. You dont need to give him a chance because all that may happen is the more time you spend together the more youll fall for him out of proximity and ignore things that are turning you off, that may be fine if thats what you want but there are many people living that life who would beg to differ. Find someone youre at least curious about and go from there, dont waste precious mental energy on people who you find meh.",

Perhaps it's best to consider moving forward as friends initially, over time, feelings can develop organically.

After he kissed me for the first time I was like oh damn, theres something here. And he wasnt even the best kisser, but Id got to know and like his personality by that point. Hopefully that makes some sort of sense! I guess what Im trying to get at is not everyone feels the physical attraction early on, sometimes it comes with time.",

Don't assume or start with an accusation. Ask from a place of curiosity. Something along the lines of \"Hey is everything okay? I didn't hear back so I was worried.\"\n\nIf you know that texting about non-urgent things  and not hearing back for a while could bother you, you could try asking to do quick phone calls every once in a while. \n\nAlso be aware that people attach different things to texting. Some people do not know how to communicate, it's how they would try to detach themselves from someone, and might advise you that it's exactly what she's doing.

Then he one night told me he's not an affectionate person after I reached for his hand and he pulled away. I must have looked at him like he had two heads because he quickly said he wasn't raised to be like that. I was confused because he was like that on his own without me prompting it. I felt like he was faking it because maybe he thought that's what I wanted and he really didn't, but he never said a word until that one night a few months in. \n\nAll this to say...has she experienced a change in her personal or professional life? Did she maybe think this is what you wanted and ultimately she was doing it to make you happy? Definitely have a conversation about it with her.

I wonder how long I would put up with it if he didnt willingly say it to me, I mightve lost more time.

I understand feeling too comfortable in a long term relationship and losing attraction a bit but 2 months felt too early for someone to feel that about me, so I wont take that offer.
