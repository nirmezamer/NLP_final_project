This project is officially moving forward and about to be kicked off! The journal recently arrived, and I am very pleased with it. Flipping through this book, I just envision all the varied words and artwork that will grace these pages. It feels nice and luxurious, looks very official, and seems to hold up well to the few pens and inks I used in my entry.\n\nMy entry has been added, and the journal is off to its first set of participants! But first, a quick little note of a changeup to how I'm going to run things through Asana.\n\nPreviously, I had intended on adding every single signup into Asana all at once. I quickly came to realize that I would need a paid account with them to add more than 14 other free users to any one project. In an effort to stave off more costs on my end for this, I am instead going to be adding people in batches of +/-10. Not only will this save me an additional $11 a month, but it also makes more sense as it'll be easier for me to just manage things from Asana alongside a separate spreadsheet - as counterintuitive as that sounds. This basically means nothing to the rest of you, but I thought I'd be as transparent as possible about my entire process within this whole thing.\n\nHere are the details of how this project will run:\n\n* All signups have been sorted by continent/region, and each round the journal travels will be kept in that area to help save shipping costs for all of you.\n* The members who are part of the current round of travel will be added to the project in Asana and given three tasks -\n   * Received Journal\n   * Added Entry\n   * Journal Sent to Next Recipient\n* The address of the person to whom you'll be sending the journal will be in the Description of the third task. Please do not share the personal info of others with anyone else.\n* Once you receive the journal, please mark the task as completed on Asana.\n* Please leave any pertinent info you feel I should have in the comments of the \"Received\" task (such as damages to the journal or alterations of someone's entry). I get realtime notifications of any task completions or comment additions. The mods have agreed that any intentional defacing of the journal will have repercussions, so this will help us track down any offenders.\n* Add your entry! Be sure to consider dry time!\n   * Please start your entry with the date, your username (and real name **if** you so choose), your location (just your country is fine, or your city as well if you like, just no actual addresses), and optionally the ink(s) and pen(s) you'll be using.\n   * Again, you can use the comments of this task to send me any important info you think I should have (ink spill, unintentional damage, etc.)\n* Once you have added your entry, please mark the task as completed on Asana.\n* Please be sure to get the journal mailed to the next person in a timely manner.\n* Once you send the journal off to the next recipient, please mark the task as completed on Asana.\n\nThat's it! For the project operations, anyway. A quick reminder of the rules:\n\n* Entries shall not be defamatory, disparaging, overtly vulgar, or otherwise harmful/hurtful.\n   * \"Overtly vulgar\" does not mean you cannot use cursing or have to refrain from nude artworks or things of that nature. Basically, don't add anything that would be considered trashy. Romance novels and fine art nudes are one thing. Porn is completely another.\n* Only entries with your own pens and inks, please. No stickers or other inserts. Instead, why not doodle a little something?\n* Do not deface or otherwise alter another person's entry.\n* I am not limiting on entry sizes, but try to keep it reasonable. :)\n* I also have no preference if you choose to start your entry on a new page or continue below the previous person's entry. Just give a decent spacing between entries if you do utilize the same page.\n* I have put a resealable shipping label sleeve on the top of the box. This way we don't have to worry about major piling of shipping stickers or carefully peeling off labels. Just use a folded piece of paper and ask your shipper to attach any shipping labels to that, then slide the paper into the sleeve. Or if you're given a shipping label, it should be able to accommodate the size of any shipper's printed labels.\n\nThe first 10 people will be receiving an email soon from Asana notifying them that they have been added ti the project. Be sure to check spam folders!\n\nIf anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me via the comments here or DMs. I will be very closely watching Reddit, Asana, and my email to stay on top of things.\n\nThanks again to everyone for helping make this project come to life! I look forward to seeing and sharing everyone's entries!",
