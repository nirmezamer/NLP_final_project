        "content": "\nI posted the script a while back on r/screenwriting and got some incredibly helpful feedback. I have so much gratitude towards those who read and to this online community as a whole.\n\nI wrote the script when I was in a real creative rut. I had fallen into the trap of writing things that I thought would impress others, terrified to write something that I genuinely wanted to write. I eventually got sick of it, and decided to write one scene a day, just for the fun of writing. Something only for me. \n\nEventually some of the scenes started taking a larger shape, and I spent a good part of six months trying to find enough logic to stitch together it all together into something even moderately cohesive. It turned into the strangest, most terrifyingly honest thing I\u2019ve written - and I\u2019m really touched that others connected to it too.\n\nSOUTHERN GOTHICK\n\nOVERALL\n8 / 10\nPREMISE\n8 / 10\nPLOT\n7 / 10\nCHARACTER\n8 / 10\nDIALOGUE\n7 / 10\nSETTING\n7 / 10\n\nLogline: An ex preacher and ex pornstar form an unlikely bond when terrorized by a small town criminal who believes himself to be the messiah.\n\nStrengths\nFor a script so stuffed with incident and style, SOUTHERN GOTHICK does a wonderful job maintaining a level of economy - in the end, almost everything in this film, despite its many many turns, turns out to matter. The interlude featuring Loretta is a perfect example - for most of the script, it feels like a completely unnecessary aside, but it\u2019s of course been saved for a coincidence vital to the climax, one that wonderfully fulfills the title \u2018the miracle\u2019. At the risk of stating the obvious, there\u2019s a wealth of style here too, which makes the film into a real blast. Everything is just so, balanced on a knife\u2019s edge between absurd and emotionally serious, and the film knows how to modulate that style too - the snake ceremony at the beginning is strange and unsettling, but we build until grandmas in fish nets are stripping to the Brothers Band. The script also does a terrific job tethering its plot to character. At the end of the day, all this happens because of the decisions of our leads, because of the ways they view the world - the way Teo prioritizes his church over honesty (thus losing the church), the way Mondo remains chillingly calm after sending the wrong address - and that only makes it more gripping.\n\nWeaknesses\nSOUTHERN GOTHICK\u2019s denouement feels both abrupt and unnecessary, and could be reconsidered. In a script that so often turns whimsy and quirk into an emotional tool, making it part of the lives of our characters, that last bit feels like quirk for quirk\u2019s sake, suddenly plunging us into the completely surreal without actually adding new information, conveying anything emotionally, or advancing the plot. Though the moments are rare, a few of the larger flourishes also fail to deepen what\u2019s going on here, and the frequent invocations of Timmy the Tooth and the dream featuring him are a good example. It\u2019s not clear what Timmy is doing here besides showing that Robin is manic and quirky and strange, something that\u2019s more than established, and the dream doesn\u2019t show us anything new - we know Teo is scared of further risk, and scared of Mondo. Revisions could also reconsider the Don monologue, which feels out of place. It entirely halts the scene, but doesn\u2019t affect Teo and Robin\u2019s decision-making - they could decide to seek out Jay all on their own - so it isn\u2019t clear what it\u2019s adding.\n\nProspects\nSOUTHERN GOTHICK would likely be a moderately expensive film to produce, with many of its pricier elements unfortunately coming from the very flourishes that make it such a joy. The puppet sequences, for instance, or the stunt work involved in some of the gorier violence, would likely be pricey, and the snake would probably have to be a CGI creation too, further driving up the price. That said, there\u2019s certainly an audience for films like this, bizarro crime narratives that invest murder plots and small-town America with coincidence, whimsy and quirk - in many ways, SOUTHERN GOTHICK feels like a member of the long line of descendants of FARGO, many of which continue to have reasonable if not gigantic box office returns. Even within that world, however, there\u2019s plenty new, interesting and unexpected here to entice fans of the genre, from the film\u2019s earnest engagement with religion to its puppet sequences to its embrace of surreal terror. These could all easily be cornerstones of a marketing campaign, pointing out just how much SOUTHERN GOTHICK has to offer.\n\nhttps://blcklst.com/scripts/156966\n\n\n\nI\u2019m deeply grateful to get this rating. Knocking on wood that I can leverage this into representation and eventually getting the project produced as my second feature (hopefully in the $1-5 million range). If you\u2019d like to read it, shoot me a DM! :-)\n",

I started it back in February, but wrote the last 78 pages in the last 2 weeks.\n\nIt clocks in at *exactly* 120 pages. I\u2019m sure there will be some trimming to be done to get the length down to a more horror-appropriate length, as a lot of modern horror tends to be shorter with a handful of exceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s a psychic horror that can be best described as an unholy combination of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY meets FINAL DESTINATION, with touches that are reminiscent of EVIL DEAD, STIGMATA, DRAG ME TO HELL and THE SIXTH SENSE. But it\u2019s also super focused and not random at all.\n\nI also have titles and plots already mapped out for 3 sequels, which I will probably start writing after a short break. This is the first time in my life after almost two decades of writing that I\u2019ve written something that has the potential for a franchise as everything else I\u2019ve ever written have all been one-offs.\n\nI\u2019m normally a one-idea-at-a-time kind of writer, but the ideas for this project are coming in hard and fast. It\u2019s definitely a new feeling that I\u2019m pretty excited about.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share the good news. Can\u2019t wait to polish it up and start sending it out.\n\nKeep going, y\u2019all. Wishing you all luck with your projects!",
