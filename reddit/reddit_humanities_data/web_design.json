Please refrain from just posting a link and instead give us a bit of a background about your creation.\n\nFeel free to request general feedback or specify feedback in a certain area like user experience, usability, design, or code review.\n\n# Feedback Providers\n\n* Please post constructive feedback. Simply saying, \"That's good\" or \"That's bad\" is useless feedback. Explain why.\n* Consider providing concrete feedback about the problem rather than the solution.  Saying, \"get rid of red buttons\" doesn't explain the problem. Saying  \"your site's success message being red makes me think it's an error\"  provides the problem. From there, suggest solutions.\n* Be specific. Vague feedback rarely helps.\n* Again, focus on why.\n* Always be respectful\n\n# Template Markup\n\n    **URL**:\n    **Purpose**:\n    **Technologies Used**:\n    **Feedback Requested**:\n    **Comments**:\n\n[**Also, join our partnered Discord!**](https://discord.gg/web)",

            "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design\n\n\nWhen designing a website on a static medium, you won\u2019t be able to address all the issues that might arise with various screen sizes. It\u2019s best to equip yourself with a bit of understanding of common practices. I usually use three concepts with clear breakpoints for screen sizes, each covering desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. The rule of thumb is that all screens should theoretically contain exactly the same components unless there\u2019s a specific reason not to. Visibility can be toggled, but each component must retain the same contextual and functional state regardless of the screen size. Even some design flaws get spotted during the development stage sometimes.",
            "Keep the same index and just change the styling by using multiple breakpoints for eg tablets and smartphones.\n\nAlso use percentages (for widths) instead of fixed units.\n\nLook up responsive web design if this is uncharted territory for you."

It uses XML for a database so the whole web application is basically designed to be run in a single folder. I'm just trying to find a place that might be able to host it. \n\nSome information on the Web Application. It is a Roleplaying Character Editor with a Combat Simulator. It's entirely web based and browser based. There isn't any real graphic card rendering necessary. Just people logging in. Very much like D&D beyond. I have no idea how many users I would have. Say 500 to 1000 users. I would have international users as well. I believe the entire web application is under 2 GB but it will grow. \n\nI see this site called Winhost.com. It has an option called Max for 10 per month, with unlimited Disk space and bandwidth. 2 GB for their SQL or MySQL however I never plan to use it. I have XML database files already created. This seems like what I need. Are there other like sites for me to compare. Am I looking at the right place or am I off about what host I need for my web application. \n\n  \nIf you need me to edit to include more information, please let me know. Ask anything. Thank you. ",
