            "Congrats to the winners. u/VertigoOne what happened to the scores? When I looked early before the maintenance the number 1 flag went to #8. Both my flags got ~0.4 extra, while my now #11 went down from #8 with the current #9 and #10 suddenly passing me.",
            "placed toward the middle...not gonna complain at all, I procrastinated on this one so bad I only got one in and didn't start it until 30 min before it was due. right in the middle is pretty good fa me given that and that it looks like the flag says \"EH\" which I only realized way too late to fix lol\n\n#1, #3, #7, #8, and #11 are my favorites. #73 is my pick for most underrated, I liked it as much as those other five and it stands out from the back half, surprised I placed ahead of it. it has a very clean but original and creative looking design to me.",

Never by intention though unlike some others, and sometimes even those parody ones score higher than mine, which is even more frustrating! I want to know is it my designs that are bad or the way i write my descriptions? \n\nAny advice? Shout me privately, thanks",
            "There were some odd anomalies in the vote gathering system that we needed to look into and correct. Some people were putting in lots of zeros and a few random numbers around the place - and when we saw the data it showed what looked like bot accounts of a kind - which mucked up the vote tally somewhat.",
            "Would you mind linking to some of your past entries? I can tell immediately why your current ones didn't do so well (people on flags doesn't really work 99% of the time) but I don't know what you've done in the past.",
            "In terms of both your most recent ones, I can summarise with three words \"far too complex\" - there is a great deal of detail and specifics in the designs you've got here. All of which will get lost in the wind. You also have the human figures in your design standing on the base of the flag - that doesn't really make sense. The lower edge is not the \"floor\"",
            "It would seem to me that your designs are generally too cluttered and use too many colors. The shades of color are often also an issue since they tend to clash and look poor visually. Sometimes they also contain unnecessary text."
