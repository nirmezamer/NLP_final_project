            "u/as545147k could you please explain your flag? It's a flag I love design wise, but I still wonder how it's connected to d-day (apart from the white part used by a US division). Your explanation didn't help either with all the celetrial harmony tripe, everything seemed so disconnected that I actually started to think it was written by a.i.\n\nP.S. this is not to hate on your submission,  I absolutely loved it but I'm still confused about the actual meaning.",
            "Congrats to the winners! My 2 favorite ones that I thought were going to get top 5 were #10 Wall Piercer by u/ethyl3517 and #57 Victory For Europe by u/Icy_Average_9356",
            "Hello guys, i need some advice for these flag contests, most of the time i tend to end up near the bottom with low marks. Never by intention though unlike some others, and sometimes even those parody ones score higher than mine, which is even more frustrating! I want to know is it my designs that are bad or the way i write my descriptions? \n\nAny advice? Shout me privately, thanks",

            "There's a lot of Trident in the winning slots. It shows that the voters didn'tpick unique ones",
            "There were some odd anomalies in the vote gathering system that we needed to look into and correct. Some people were putting in lots of zeros and a few random numbers around the place - and when we saw the data it showed what looked like bot accounts of a kind - which mucked up the vote tally somewhat.",
            "Would you mind linking to some of your past entries? I can tell immediately why your current ones didn't do so well (people on flags doesn't really work 99% of the time) but I don't know what you've done in the past.",
            "In terms of both your most recent ones, I can summarise with three words \"far too complex\" - there is a great deal of detail and specifics in the designs you've got here. All of which will get lost in the wind. You also have the human figures in your design standing on the base of the flag - that doesn't really make sense. The lower edge is not the \"floor\"",
            "It would seem to me that your designs are generally too cluttered and use too many colors. The shades of color are often also an issue since they tend to clash and look poor visually. Sometimes they also contain unnecessary text.",
            "I think it's the little shield on this one - it's very small for a flag detail and so looks out of place. I would say think about flags you really like or popular famous flags and what they have on them and when you go to add something to your flag ask yourself if anything like that would appear on those."
