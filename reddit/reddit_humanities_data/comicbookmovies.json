This post will be your source for clarification on rules, how to reach mods with any issues and any other potential issues in the future. \n\nWe want to start by saying first and foremost that this is a safe, fun space for all. We ask that you are kind and respectful to others when you comment, reply or post. We want everyone to enjoy their time here and to feel included. So please, be respectful of others feelings, likes, choices, etc. While we try not to ban people for minor offenses, being repeatedly disrespectful of others, homophobic, sexist, racist, hateful, etc. will likely result in an immediate permanent ban. If you believe you are a target of any of this, please do not engage and instead report the incident, as engaging could also result in your ban, as well.\n\nThis sub is a informative sub first. Any news related to movies, shows, games, comic, animations, etc. is our focus here. Other content such as, but not limited to: Rankings, Questions, Casting Choices, VS, etc. If you would like to post this kind of content, another sub related to that topic would be a better choice for you. We do allow these kinds of topics to be posted on Sundays 12AM ETS, but they must also follow the rest of the rules for this sub to be allowed.\n\nReddit, along with other social media, has been overflowing with scam and bot accounts in recent years. To try and combat this, we have created an automod to ban any accounts it believes to be an issues. If your account has been banned, there is a good chance the automod has blocked your account for a variety of reasons. We do our best to prevent bots, scams, trolls, etc. from coming to this sub. For this reason, if the automod believes your account to be one of these possible types of accounts, it will automatically ban your account. Some reasons the automod may ban your account are, but not limited to:\n\n\\- Your account is new and/or low karma\n\n\\- It detects your IPS Address coming from a known spam/bot Address\n\n\\- You had a previous account already banned\n\nIf you believe your account was ban inappropriately, please message the sub itself about this issue. When messaging, please be respectful and understanding of the situation. If you are disrespectful and inappropriate, we will likely keep the ban in place. Personally messaging Mods will also result in the ban staying in place. Reply to the ban message respectfully, and a mod will get to you as soon as possible.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to yourself and will help you while being apart of this sub. We hope that if you are new you will follow the sub and add to the community. Again, we welcome you here and hope you have a great day!",

They keep doing laps over and over and over again and that scene was barely featured in the finish film (maybe in the extended cut).",
