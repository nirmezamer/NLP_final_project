            "Bring yourself back to December 24, 2020. The first major Genshin update in the way. You enter this snowy inhospitable land and decide to be cheeky. You enter Amber's charged attack thinking the flame will keep you warm. You saw the sheer cold counter pop up anyway. You panic and rush to any torches the moment you saw that sheer cold counter. The further you go in Dragonspine, the more you let that counter build up not bothering you because you know you can risk more. Then it happens. The counter built up and you are losing health. But you thought actually it's manageable. A fast but not instant drain. It's okay, you thought until your first death. And then you are back to diligently never letting the counter build up more than halfway. Also, you mald a lot from the main Dragonspine quest asking you to fight 3 cryo abyss mage near water while facing sheer cold and you have to finish it within a timer all the while your newly ascended AR 35 ass is facing a new world level.",

            "protip from a gacha veteran: it's a *really bad* idea to get into a new game solely because of one character, especially if that character is part of a particular niche that doesn't show up as often in the game itself",
            "i know foul's reliable so i'm not saying the leak's fake, but i feel like there definitely has to be some sort of caveat if the multiplier leaks are real. i mean, 120% multipliers for NAs based off of HP? (unless i'm misreading it haha) i just went to check furina's lv. 10 crabaletta scalings and it's only 14.92%\n\ni really wonder what the specifics of her kit will look like because jesus"
