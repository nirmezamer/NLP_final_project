Someone pointed out on the main sub I think? That in the Winter Night's Lazzo, Pierro was referring to a singular sage instead of plural in the CN translation. (If this is false then rip my theory), but I'm pretty sure that the Sage refers to Vederfolnir, and the 4 pillars are the other sinners. They mention how they were trying to persuade the higher ups to stop them from continuing to poke around the secrets of the Heavens/Celestia. We now know in 4.7 that these 5 did in fact not stop prying, but betrayed Khaenri'ah causing the Cataclysm.!<"
