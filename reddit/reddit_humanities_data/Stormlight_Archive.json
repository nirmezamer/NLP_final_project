Please tag any spoilery discussion as needed.\n\nFor the time being we are going to direct all discussions related to this game and the Kickstarter to this megathread and r/stormlightrpg.\n\n# r/StormlightRPG Subreddit\n\nSome of the mods of this and other Sanderson subreddits have taken the initiative to set up a subreddit specifically for the Stormlight RPG: r/StormlightRPG\n\nr/Stormlight_Archive and r/Cosmere (and to a lesser extent r/BrandonSanderson) primarily exist to facilitate *book discussion* and relevant news. While we may allow some on-topic discussions about this game, these subreddits are ill-suited to serve as primary discussion places *for the game itself*.\n\nr/StormlightRPG is a community for people to discuss the TTRPG, ask questions about the game, discuss rules and mechanics, talk about art and lore, share resources and homebrew ideas, and more. Be warned that the subreddit has a *different spoiler policy*, to better suit the needs of discussing the game.\n\nLearn more and check out current discussion here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stormlightrpg/comments/1daf5dy/welcome\\_to\\_rstormlightrpg](https://www.reddit.com/r/stormlightrpg/comments/1daf5dy/welcome_to_rstormlightrpg)\n\n# News\n\nThe Kickstarter for the Stormlight Archive RPG has been announced for August 6th.\n\nBeta playtesting materials will also be available on that date--more info to come.\n\nSome art and additional details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/1daeyta/comment/l7jtp0h).\n\n# Links\n\n* [Kickstarter preview page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/the-stormlight-archive-rpg)\n* Brotherwise Games: [Website](https://www.brotherwisegames.com/) - [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FemrhgUTuD) - [Twitter/X](https://x.com/bwisegames) - [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brotherwisegames) - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brotherwisegames/?hl=en)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* What is the Stormlight Archive RPG?\n   * A [table-top roleplaying game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) (TTRPG) created in partnership with Dragonsteel and Brotherwise Games.\n\nPlease let us know in the comments if there are any questions you have or information that you'd like added to this post!",

            "To elaborate a bit on the post and explain why a new subreddit --- we're \\*hoping\\* that as the community of fans of the game evolves and grows, the subreddit can be a place for a game-focused community, with people posting about the cool adventure they ran the night before, asking for help designing scenarios or running adventures, looking for play partners for online games, etc.  \n\n\nThese conversations will get drowned out in /r/stormlight_archive, so we're trying to create a place where they \\*won't\\* get drowned out.   \n\n\nWe're all one community, and book-focused readers are welcome over there, and game-focused readers are welcome over here ... but the ability of the community to have focused discussions on specific topics is enhanced by having places with specific focus. We hope that /r/stormlightrpg will be a great place to discuss \\*the game\\* and to share in the joy of playing, and running, the game, without conversations about it being drowned out by the hype and excitement around Wind and Truth.",

I\u2019m at chapter 57 and I just listened to  Adolin request his boon and the moment Kaladin started to speak I skipped to chapter 58 lol \nI simply couldnt hear him say those words again. I was literally dying inside as it was leading up and I bailed on the final minute of the chapter. i was squeezing my eyes shut trying to hide from it, so pathetic. I just couldn\u2019t do it.\n \nI am a person who gets uncomfortable in awkward situations or stressful situations. Obviously no one likes them, but I handle them poorly\u2026 like it eats me alive inside. So I\u2019m not surprised by my reaction. \n\nNote: Important thing, the scene is necessary and critical to the plot. It\u2019s pretty well done. My reaction is not to imply anything negative toward the writing or story. Kaladins actions make sense. Also it is the scene that causes Kaladin to momentarily support Moash. \n",

            "Is it weird that I didn't find that moment that awkward? Clearly many people do, as this is not the first recent post about it.\n\n\n\nLike, I'm all for getting emotionally invested in books, I was physiologicaly uncomfortable in the lead up to that fight because I knew what was going to happen. But after, I'm just like, \"welp, Kaladin fucked up, oh well\". Like it barely even registers for me.\n\n\nIs it more awkward on the audiobook?",
            "May be a hot take but I truly believe Kaladin did nothing wrong in this scene, his only fault in this moment was not being a lighteyes",
            "I have such pity for kaladin in that moment. Like he has known previously about how the system works, but he's been seduced to think it works differently, and he forgets. It's just... Sad.",
            "It's only a cringe moment because of the result.\n\nIf Elhokar agreed and they had a 2v2 against Amaram and Sadeas everybody would love it and call it a bad ass moment.",
            "After a few re reads I see it differently. Kal just accomplished one of the dumbest, yet most heroic acts the Alethi elite had ever seen. The man just saved the kings cousin from physical impairment at best, to certain death at worst. A dark eyed former slave showed the Alethi monarchy the meaning of Honor, the LEAST he deserves is a boon. He was then promptly thrown in Jail by Ehlokar. Even Dalinar was blind to the hypocrisy of not getting his way even when his son almost died. the plan was pretty much over as soon as 4 shard bearers entered the arena. Ehlokar was a child pretending to be a tyrant.",
            "To be fair. Of Elokhar would be a better king he could have handeld it better. Danilar even implies this a little bit later when he visits Kal in the dungeon.",
            "I quite literally do not understand people feeling awkward at this moment how was it not a powerful moment. A man just saved another mans life without using shards against shards bearers. Then the man he saves is offered a reward. Of course he felt he deserved some compensation for all the garbage he has gone through. If he was a light eyed they would have listened so like whats the issue",
            "When I reread WoR for the first time, that part made me actually stop the reread because I was frustrated. I reread again recently though (after 3 years) and it didn't bother me much this time.",
            "I literally said out loud to myself \u201cKaladin, read the room buddy!\u201d As I cringed. Breaking classist/social norms are always a bit cringe and sticking with the pro quo elite can make it seem like a especially cringe moment (because in their eyes it totally was, regardless of his bad-ass-er-y).\n\n\nThat being said, acknowledging its incredible badassness and the need to assert himself as a major player in Dalinars forces (I can\u2019t remember if he was already a major player yet or if that was the literary build up), he totally should have every right to ask for a boon."

            "Given the setup in that scene and earlier in OB it\u2019s pretty clear that\u2019s what he was going to say - exactly what it ended up being.\n\nI have the fortune of having been reading this series from day 1 and remember all the speculation about what everyone thoughts the oaths would be.  This one was speculated after WoR and was all but confirmed in OB before finally being said in RoW.  There wasn\u2019t really much doubt.\n\n\n\nFrom the gemstone epigraphs in OB- \n\n\"My spren claims that recording this will be good for me, so here I go. Everyone says I will swear the Fourth Ideal soon, and in so doing, earn my armor. I simply don't think that I can. Am I not supposed to want to help people?\"\n\nHardcover pages 1131-1132:\n\nKaladin thought, finally, of Dalinar.\n\nCould Kaladin do it? Could he really say these Words? Could he mean them?\n\nThe Fused swept close. Adolin bled.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nYou know what you need to do.\n\n\"I...can't,\" Kaladin finally whispered, tears streaming down his cheeks.  \"I can't lose him, but...oh, Almighty...I can't save him.\" Kaladin bowed his head, sagging forward, trembling.\n\nHe couldn't say those Words.\n\nHe wasn't strong enough.\n\nSyl's arms enfolded him from behind, and he felt softness as her cheek pressed against the back of  his neck. She pulled him tight as he wept, sobbing, at his failure.\n\nBoth of those already make it clear the 4th ideal for Windrunners is about accepting that you can't protect everyone",
            "Presumably the same ideal, but with a \"will\" inserted.",
            "Ideals are very permissive with wording, you don't need to say \"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination\" either, just something like that",
            "That\u2019s strange. I recently listened to that part of Oathbringer and in the audiobook he says \u201cI will..\u201d not just \u201cI\u2026\u201d it struck me as odd since we also see Teft swear an ideal in a different wording. I didn\u2019t know that it was written differently as I haven\u2019t bought the physical books yet.",
            "\"I, Kaladin Stormblessed, being of sound mind and body, do hereby leave my worldly possessions to Bridge Four, and accept that there are those I cannot protect.\"",
            "That\u2019s kind of what I was wondering about. We know what his 4th Ideal ended up being, but also know that different people can swear the same ideal with different words; I thought this might be a case where Kal was going to say one thing to swear an Ideal but later said a different thing. If that makes sense.",
            "The audiobooks are typically based around the original version of the book. There are a few minor changes that have been made since publication, though the only major one is in Words of Radiance (in relation to how the Kaladin vs Szeth fight ends). Presumably the book was adjusted to better reflect what the 4th ideal would be?",
            "He does say that a little earlier- \n\nPage 1126\n\nKaladin fell to his knees on the cold obsidian of Shadesmar. Fused descended around them, six figures in brilliant, flapping clothing. He had a single slim hope. Each Ideal he\u2019d spoken had resulted in an outpouring of power and strength. He licked his lips and tried whispering it. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026 I will\u2026\u201d He thought of friends lost. Malop. Jaks. Beld and Pedin.\n\nWhen he gets really close to saying it thought, it\u2019s left out.",
