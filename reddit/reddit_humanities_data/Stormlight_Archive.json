Please tag any spoilery discussion as needed.\n\nFor the time being we are going to direct all discussions related to this game and the Kickstarter to this megathread and r/stormlightrpg.\n\n# r/StormlightRPG Subreddit\n\nSome of the mods of this and other Sanderson subreddits have taken the initiative to set up a subreddit specifically for the Stormlight RPG: r/StormlightRPG\n\nr/Stormlight_Archive and r/Cosmere (and to a lesser extent r/BrandonSanderson) primarily exist to facilitate *book discussion* and relevant news. While we may allow some on-topic discussions about this game, these subreddits are ill-suited to serve as primary discussion places *for the game itself*.\n\nr/StormlightRPG is a community for people to discuss the TTRPG, ask questions about the game, discuss rules and mechanics, talk about art and lore, share resources and homebrew ideas, and more. Be warned that the subreddit has a *different spoiler policy*, to better suit the needs of discussing the game.\n\nLearn more and check out current discussion here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stormlightrpg/comments/1daf5dy/welcome\\_to\\_rstormlightrpg](https://www.reddit.com/r/stormlightrpg/comments/1daf5dy/welcome_to_rstormlightrpg)\n\n# News\n\nThe Kickstarter for the Stormlight Archive RPG has been announced for August 6th.\n\nBeta playtesting materials will also be available on that date--more info to come.\n\nSome art and additional details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/1daeyta/comment/l7jtp0h).\n\n# Links\n\n* [Kickstarter preview page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/the-stormlight-archive-rpg)\n* Brotherwise Games: [Website](https://www.brotherwisegames.com/) - [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FemrhgUTuD) - [Twitter/X](https://x.com/bwisegames) - [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brotherwisegames) - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brotherwisegames/?hl=en)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* What is the Stormlight Archive RPG?\n   * A [table-top roleplaying game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) (TTRPG) created in partnership with Dragonsteel and Brotherwise Games.\n\nPlease let us know in the comments if there are any questions you have or information that you'd like added to this post!",

            "To elaborate a bit on the post and explain why a new subreddit --- we're \\*hoping\\* that as the community of fans of the game evolves and grows, the subreddit can be a place for a game-focused community, with people posting about the cool adventure they ran the night before, asking for help designing scenarios or running adventures, looking for play partners for online games, etc.  \n\n\nThese conversations will get drowned out in /r/stormlight_archive, so we're trying to create a place where they \\*won't\\* get drowned out.   \n\n\nWe're all one community, and book-focused readers are welcome over there, and game-focused readers are welcome over here ... but the ability of the community to have focused discussions on specific topics is enhanced by having places with specific focus. We hope that /r/stormlightrpg will be a great place to discuss \\*the game\\* and to share in the joy of playing, and running, the game, without conversations about it being drowned out by the hype and excitement around Wind and Truth.",

That doesnt suit her character at all (and would be bad writing just to remove a bondsmith and Urithiru after we just got both in the last book). More like trying to free him with her own bondsmith powers. Also the Sibling shoud give her some protection now.",

So i decided it was finally time to dive into the Stormlight Archive for the first time.  I just finished WoK and I had to come here and say WOW! The amount of satisfying plot twists with literally every plot line was just masterful. \n\nDalinar and Sadeas, the shardblade???\nKaladin and Dalinar. It was definitely hinted at the would be crossing paths eventually but what an epic way to do it. \nShallan and Jasnah\u2014did not see ANY of that coming. \nSzeth meeting his master, and that being the source of all the epigraphs. Seeing how that will tie in with Dalinar. \n\nJust so friggen awesome. My plan has been to work through the series so when my preorder if Wind and Truth arrives I\u2019ll just be finishing Rhythm of War. I really enjoyed the entirety of Way of Kings, but I just can\u2019t get over how it ended. I was actually just sitting in my yard reading it laughing out loud in shock. \n\nNot much else to add. Just had to share this as a first time reader!",

            "Take this with a grain of salt because this Kickstarter is my first foray into the world of miniatures. \n\nThe prepainted ones all look great to me.  I haven't looked closely enough to nit pick.\n\nQA on the resin statue was lacking. They needed to replace mine, but customer service was responsive, super friendly and even though it took a while they replaced the whole thing to correct my issue.  Great great customer service (not fast). they got completely overwhelmed by this thing and it is no wonder. \n\nSanderlanch indeed.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nNow to the unpainted miniatures.  \n\nI think they are fine. Small. \nI knew they would be small. That was clear, but I had not really internalized how small.\nThe details are good but not amazing. \nThey come individual and complete. \nThat is, they are not attached to each other and don't require assembly.\n\nThe details are ok for molded miniatures. You have work to do cleaning seems etc before prime or paint. I didn't have other minis to compare it to but I suspect this is not unusual in mass produced items. \n\nI would expect slightly different cleaning challenges in Resin or filament printed minis. IMHO a nice resin print in my mini 8k s blows these away but I doubt you can mass produce economically with DLP printers at all for items at that don't demand premium prices all the time.\n\nI'm in my fifties and my hand shakes a little so I've learned about big bright magnifying glasses and weighted gloves. \nWorking such small details is a challenge.\n\nOf course, how obsessed you are with being able to see Kaladin's pupils on a small scale miniature is your own problem. \n\nI bought in hard on this and have all of the offered minis.  Working on Shallon most recently.\n\nThe bridge four bridge is cute and makes a fine display stand. I may try to come up with appropriately scaled raggedly dressed minis to carry it now that I think of it. \n\nNo side carry. \n\nBridge Four!",
