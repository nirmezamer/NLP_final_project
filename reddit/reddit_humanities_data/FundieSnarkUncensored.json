        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nHappy Saturday!\n\nAnd a Happy April's Fools, unfortunately this is not a joke announcement or post (sorry about that!) but we do have some news for everyone.\n\nWe've updated and changed the rules! Below, you'll see the newly updated rules. We essentially condensed and changed some of the wording to make a shorter list. A reminder that the claim of 'I didn't know that was a rule' or 'I didn't see that rule' is NOT an excuse. We urge everyone to read through this list carefully, and if you have any concerns, send us a modmail. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1)    **Look but don\u2019t touch:** \n\nYou can view their content, but you cannot interact with their content. This includes (but is not limited to) commenting, answering poll questions, emailing them, etc. Anyone found to be engaging with the fundies will be met with a permanent ban with no eligibility for appeal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2)    **Be kind & remember the human:** \n\nComments that are rude and/or antagonistic will not be tolerated. Bigoted, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, racist, ableist, antisemitic, or misogynistic language will not be tolerated. T**his includes speculating on the sexuality or gender identity of literally anyone**. Do not use terms such as \"Hitler\" or \"Heitler\" to refer to fundies. Doing so will result in an immediate permanent ban. Being kind also means using trigger warnings as needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)    **Archive links of fundie-run websites and mirror YouTube videos:** \n\nDirect links fundie-run websites will be removed because we don't want to send traffic to these sites. You can archive links to these sites via: [www.archive.is](https://www.archive.is), [www.archive.org/web/](https://www.archive.org/web/), or [www.unvis.it](https://www.unvis.it). Just paste the URL in, and it will create an archive link for you to share. You can use websites like [hooktube.com](https://hooktube.com) and [https://ytprivate.com/feed/trending](https://ytprivate.com/feed/trending) to share videos without giving the fundie any views. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4)    **Verify with mods prior to doing AMAs:**\n\nDid you escape the fundie life? Did you rub elbows with a fundie at a cream of crap convention? We\u2019d love to hear about it! If you\u2019re interested, please get in touch with the mods first to get yourself verified. We want to keep the experience authentic, so all AMA's must be mod approved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5)    **Christian snark only:** \n\nThis is a snark sub for fundamentalist Christians- keep it fundie & keep it snarky. While we welcome snarkers from all different backgrounds, **the people we snark on are Fundamentalist Christians and only Fundamentalist Christians**. There are other subs dedicated to other faiths or about religious bullshittery in general if you find run-of-the-mill religious weirdness. This means no snarking on Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, etc. Some branches of Christianity considered fundamentalists (in addition to fundie Protestants) are TradCaths, hardcore Mormons, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\n \n\n6)    **Appearance snark and body shaming:** \n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to define what is crossing the line, you\u2019ll know it when you see it. Saying Fred/Franny Fundie looks like X is fine. (Ex: David Rodrigues looks like Shrek, B-Beal looks like the Grandpa from The Munsters.) Saying you do/don\u2019t find someone attractive is fine. Do not snark on the appearance or bodies of children, with the exception of choices that their parents have made for them, or how they may appear in relation to their parents. (Examples: Janessa looks malnourished while David is obviously well-fed, or how the Collins kids always wear filthy clothing is fine.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7)    **No Fundie-esque crap:** \n\nIf your content could come out of the mouth of the fundies, we don\u2019t want it here. Users found to be engaging in such rhetoric will be banned. It\u2019s okay to hold a nuanced view of complex issues, but if your opinion would be at home in a fundies mouth, we won\u2019t tolerate it.\n\n \n\n8)    **No gatekeeping:** \n\nDo not tell people what they can and can\u2019t snark on. Different people have different opinions on what is/isn\u2019t snarkable and we want to respect that so long as it isn\u2019t rule-breaking. **Do not tell people they have to censor kids\u2019 faces. You can censor them if YOU want to, but nobody HAS to and YOU don\u2019t get to tell people they have to.** Personally disliking something is *NOT* a reason to report a post or comment. Unless a post or comment breaks sub rules or Reddit ToS, do not report it. Scroll past. \n\n \n\n9)    **Armchair Diagnosing:** \n\nWhile it\u2019s fine to comment that you think a fundie is showing the signs X illness, it\u2019s not okay to make fun of it. Mental illness is a serious issue, and it\u2019s ok to have concern, but it\u2019s not cool to be snarky about it. Cool: \u201cI think Kelly is exhibiting signs of bipolar disorder.\u201d Not Cool: \u201cKarissa is acting more depressed than the economy.\u201d or \"Franny Fundie for sure has multiple personality disorder.\"",
