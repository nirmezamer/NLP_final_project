Ask away here!\n\nRecently, we at /r/Google have noticed a large number of support questions being asked. For a long time, we\u2019ve removed these posts and directed the users to other subreddits, like /r/techsupport. However, we feel that users should be able to ask their Google-related questions here. These monthly threads serve as a hub for all of the support you need, as well as discussion about any Google products.\n\n        \n> **Please note!** Top level comments must be related to the topics discussed above.

            "What's the point of this \"Megathread\" if no one ever helps anyone?? ",
            "Who else is getting the annoying \"Search with an AI-powered boost\" pop-up from Google searches? There doesn't appear to be any option to actually disable it, just a \"Not Now\" button which seems to get ignored after a few searches and the pop-up comes back.",
            " So lately we have been having problems with our Nest Hub 2nd Gen in the kitchen - asking it a relatively simple maths question such as 'hey google, whats 353 divided by 4' it pauses then says 'i doent know how to help but i found these answers on search.' I noticed that when asking the question it the text on the screen says 'whats 3 5 3' then it stops. I have tried this on our other Nest Hub 2nd Gen and our first Gen - all of them are doing the exact same thing. Yet, asking the Hub Max it answers the question with no problem at all. Is / has anyone else had this issue?",
            "I have one user in my domain that is unable to send and receive internal emails, but external emails seem to be working just fine. This users' settings are no different than any others, but seem to be the only one experiencing this issue. Any ideas why, or what i can do to fix this?",
            "someone has been attempting to log into my Gmail accounts and I keep getting texts for it (and even calls). I have 2FA on but Ive noticed my legit logins have G in front of the code and the other persons attempts do not (ex: g-xxxxxx vs xxxxxx). Any ideas as to why? It still comes from the 22000 usually but I also got one from 833-902-0108 and two phone calls from a 202 number. I have a complex password & 2FA on so Im not tooooo concerned but I am a little anxious.",
            "I accidentally sent an email through the wrong gmail account and I didn't realize I had the undo button enabled yet I deleted the email from my sent folder and trash bin. Does that still unsend it? or nah.",
            "Anyone know what happened to google shopping??? The save button for items is just gone. Where did all my saved lists of items go? How do I save items again?",
            "My google chrome colors are inverted and the the darks are all white and vice versa. The setting itself is turned off as well as the settings on windows 10.",
            "Hi everyone. I have this annoying problem: the other day I tried to login to my account, which password I remember by heart. But the email didn't recognize me, although I was using my windows 11 PC, from which I created the email in the first place. The first time it asked me to provide a phone number to get a code and I did. Yet after the first try I got an error message saying I tried many times to get a code. Now the email won't recognize neither my PC nor my geographic location even though I didn't move an inch.  \nWhat can I do? I can't lose access to the account at any cost :(  \nI can't recover it also. It keeps giving me the error message that I tried many times to login from the 3rd attempt now.",
            "Yesterday I was working for about an hour and a half on a lab report. This morning, my document prompted me to reload without unsaved changes and I cant find my progress anywhere in my history. Ive tried removing and reinstalling the offline extension with no luck. Is there anywhere my progress is stored and I can get it back? Thanks."

Google assistant is better for managing and doing things around the phone's apps and services. Gemini is not good at it yet. In time we will see something which combines the strengths of the two.",

            "You also can't use the identity song playing feature in Gemini whereas the Assistant easily understands it.\n \nGemini is basically a massive downgrade being pushed by google as an \"upgrade\"",
            "I asked Gemini how old is Joe biden? \n\nMan the response was just insane.",
            "I'm gonna turn it off as well. I was asking about the running time of a movie and the assistant does that flawlessly instead I get Gemini saying that the movie doesn't exist because it's from 2023.",
