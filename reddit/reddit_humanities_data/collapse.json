            "Located in Alabama, US We're in a heatwave right now. And so, I work outside with easy access to an air conditioned building. It is getting really tough to stay outside and finish my tasks recently. I've worked at the same location for 4 years now and it has never been this bad this early. It's 8 am at 89\u00b0 with 84% humidity, and while Alabama is known to be warm, it's not supposed to be this intense.\u00a0 This may be my last year working the summer outside, which is really sad for me because I hate being inside a building 10 hours a day. However, with water breaks being denied to workers in Texas and Florida, I know Alabama is next to remove those safety regulations. I can't be too careful knowing that they're fine pushing us into heat strokes to maintain their profit margins. My coworkers are operating like this is normal though. I can't help but feel I'm the paranoid one, even though the heat starts giving me headaches. The job is great and it pays decent with fulltime hours, but I just can't withstand this climate. I'm just ranting since I feel alone in this.",
            "Location: SE Wisconsin, USA\n\nWe're not even five days into summer and we're past our yearly average for tornadoes. We had 5 in the area on Saturday night. There is currently an even stronger storm system forming around Minnesota that is going to hit us in the early morning hours. The local stations keep increasing the severity of the weather we should expect. I'm hearing terms like squall, derecho, and hurricane force or straight line winds. This has been becoming the trend the last few years and I believe climate change has moved tornado alley to now include my area as well.",
            "Location Asheville NC USA\n\nNC passed a mask ban where customers can be told to remove their masks when entering a business.  Citizens can also call the police if they deem the person suspicious.  This basically gives people the right to harass anyone wearing a mask.  I was reading a story about a women with cancer that was refused service at a auto care business becasue she wouldn't remove her mask.  Covid is on the rise here.  I live in a fairly big city so I have options to go to another business but for people in rural areas where there is only one grocery or only one auto repair business they don't have options.  This is a very cruel law.  I contine masking even though it's illegal now.  I moved here in the last year and I would't have come to NC if I know they were going to make this law as I am immunocompromised.",
            "Location: Northern NY.\u00a0\n\nThe heat wave last week finally broke, replaced by some heavy rain and thunderstorms. What was really unusual though is that we had tornado warnings/watches. I don\u2019t recall ever seeing a tornado watch, or hearing of one being reported, so this is new territory.",
            "Location: Cincinnati, Ohio, USA\n\nA break in the heatwave of the past 10 days (90s every day, 10+ degrees above normal) this morning. Birds are around during the day, lightning bugs at night, but hardly any bees at all. Where are the bees? I have a backyard full of pollinator plants, but I rarely see a bee this year (compared to tons of bees the previous 4 years we\u2019ve been here). Very concerning.",
            "Location: Vermont\n\nTornado warnings yesterday for the first time in memory. Of course nearly instantly we had the revisionist historians out there trying to tell everyone tornadoes are totally normal in Vermont. Don\u2019t look up!",
            "Location: Oklahoma City \nA powerful storm with winds of up to 85 miles per hour came through last night. There is tornado like damage in various parts of the city and over 32,000 without power. Temps today will 102 to 104 degrees with high humidity making it feel like temps of 112 to 115 degrees. It could be days before power is restored. Strangely, the storm completely missed us. Not even a drop of rain, while a few miles to the east was chaos.",
            "The flooding in southern Minnesota has damaged a dam to the point it created a new waterway next to it. We're due for more rain tonight so the small city of Mankato nearby is relying on dykes to stay safe. I'm pretty worried, the dam was put on a list in 2021 and politics have been ongoing since.",
            "Location United States.\nThat debate was HORRENDOUS. What an absolute joke. The discussion thread crashed. I cannot believe they let Biden go on that stage. The fact that trump can't stay on topic or tell anything resembling the truth about anything is typical but he was especially off tonight. In comparison Biden was an absolute zombie. What the fuck is happening right now. This shit is nuts. How did we get here? What comes next? Just bring on the aliens or Russian invasion. The United States is in a bad way. If Trump wins again its gonna be insane.",
            "Location: California\n\nIt's been a pretty hot summer this year, last couple of days went over 100 and it's dry. Today however, it showered rain in the morning. I went over to notify my mom. She told me that thunderstorms happen in the summer around here, which is utter bullshit from my perspective. Our region doesn't get monsoon season, it's a Mediterranean climate.  We've been living here our whole lives and this doesn't just happen in the middle of summer unless there's a freak weather event, and it isn't even a thunderstorm, just rain. This indicated to me that even when being faced with blatant evidence people will double down on denial, and that perspective is starting to get pretty depressing to me. I think I've mostly moved through the stages of acceptance regarding the trajectory of our global society, but I guess I was just hoping that at some point I would be able to at least live in truth with the people around me while things go to shit. Sometimes I feel like maybe *I'm* the one in Plato's cave while everyone else lives in reality. When looking at the actual data, we're for sure fucked. But then you have huge portions of the population basically calling all climate data authoritarian propaganda. Even the people that I thought were on the verge of collapse-awareness and had an open mind to learning about the eco crisis will now quickly change the subject when these topics are brought up. I honestly thought things were becoming more obvious. Sometimes I  just feel like I'm going fucking crazy."

            "The Deluge by Stephen Markley. It\u2019s set ~2010-2040, so charts the collapse in action. An American classic in the making. Not an emotionally easy read but very, very good. He charts the rise of polarisation and fascism in a terrifyingly realistic way.\n\nThe Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson is a similar near future charting collapse. It\u2019s slightly more hopeful and covers an almost believable (on a good day) best case scenario. It\u2019s more European focused, but starts with an Indian heatwave that kills millions which seems completely and devastatingly likely.",

            "I really like Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (Oryx and Crake was already mentioned). Set around \\~2050 in terms of how far her scientific/technological extrapolations went, the books not only explore the sheer depravity of the last stage of a consumerist/capitalist society, but also our reaction to it. The cast of characters throughout the series, ranging from selfish bafoons, mad narcissistic scientists, self-flagellating eco-cultists, and general victims of the system, shows the various personal ways to approach collapse, and intertwines them beautifully."
