            "Location: North Carolina - Piedmont area\n\nIt's been hitting over 100 on the heat index every day for the past three days (and before this it's been in the 90's for weeks). We have a few more days left of 100+ temps, possibly reaching as high as 108 on the heat index). \n\n\nThere has been no rain for weeks.  Everywhere you go, the trees are dying. I'm even losing a few in my yard.  My clover lawn, which usually hosts bees, is fucking dead, and the bees are not even coming out for the bee balm, which they usually swarm. I don't know if it's because it's so hot, or if they're dead. \n\nI feel like I'm actually watching the world burn to death in my own backyard, and it's beyond heartbreaking to watch.",
            "Located in Alabama, US We're in a heatwave right now. And so, I work outside with easy access to an air conditioned building. It is getting really tough to stay outside and finish my tasks recently. I've worked at the same location for 4 years now and it has never been this bad this early. It's 8 am at 89\u00b0 with 84% humidity, and while Alabama is known to be warm, it's not supposed to be this intense.\u00a0 This may be my last year working the summer outside, which is really sad for me because I hate being inside a building 10 hours a day. However, with water breaks being denied to workers in Texas and Florida, I know Alabama is next to remove those safety regulations. I can't be too careful knowing that they're fine pushing us into heat strokes to maintain their profit margins. My coworkers are operating like this is normal though. I can't help but feel I'm the paranoid one, even though the heat starts giving me headaches. The job is great and it pays decent with fulltime hours, but I just can't withstand this climate. I'm just ranting since I feel alone in this.",
            "Location: Philly, US\n\nI've been following this subreddit for a little bit over a year now. This is my first time posting.\u00a0\n\nThis heatwave was so intense that my air conditioner stopped working effectively. It was running on full blast in the coldest setting, but it completely failed to cool anything down unless you were literally standing right in front of it. I have about 450 sq ft of studio space, so there's not a lot of space to cool. Also, for reference, I had absolutely no issues with this unit last year. It was so hot yesterday that all I could do was feel like a piece of shit and drift in and out of consciousness. I hate the idea of getting a new air conditioner. I got this one just last year, and it was kind of expensive. I'm not really sure I can even afford a new unit. But, with July coming up, I feel like there's gonna be no other choice but to figure it out.\n\nIn my day-to-day experiences of collapse, I find it easy to get upset or agitated over little things. When I get trapped in my own little bubble world, I tend to forget how we all arrived at this point. I will blame myself for so many things without considering the full picture. I find myself particularly sensitive to the individualized pressures that this society tends to motivate, especially when I am not consciously and critically considering their underlying motivations. This subreddit helps to remind me to appreciate who I am and what little time we all have left. While looking through these posts can be depressing, the honesty in this subreddit is incredibly refreshing. You guys keep me sane, so thank you.",
            "Location: SW Ontario. A family annihilator situation happened in a small rural town; a man took out his wife, two kids, and then himself. It's been really, really hot here under a heat dome for the past several days. Family annihilator events are more common in hot weather.\n\nPeople are angrier, more unhinged. In Canada, the rage is palpable. Many are blaming the federal government for their problems, but their problems are the same problems that are happening globally. We're increasingly blaming international students too.\n\nWill we start to reach American levels of violence? Heat, poverty and western entitlement are not a great combination.",
            "Location: Coastal Maine, USA\n\nWe had a heatwave this week that scorched the garden and sent us scrambling underground. Thank goodness for New England construction and deep basements. People around here brag about not needing AC but those folks have been quieter lately. \n\nOur neighbors are setting up volunteer home-checks for the elderly, based on the school bus routes, but of course they aren\u2019t covering everyone. \n\nThis area is set up well for medium term climate change, with cool temperatures most of the year and plenty of water. But individuals are not ready- and we have the oldest population of any US state so the heath burden is pretty daunting.",
            "Location: SE Wisconsin, USA\n\nWe're not even five days into summer and we're past our yearly average for tornadoes. We had 5 in the area on Saturday night. There is currently an even stronger storm system forming around Minnesota that is going to hit us in the early morning hours. The local stations keep increasing the severity of the weather we should expect. I'm hearing terms like squall, derecho, and hurricane force or straight line winds. This has been becoming the trend the last few years and I believe climate change has moved tornado alley to now include my area as well.",
            "Location: Oklahoma, U.S.A. \n\nLooking at the extended forecast, we\u2019ll be under Heat Advisories from 12pm to 9pm daily until Halloween, I guess. Heat index was 111\u00b0f (43.9\u00b0c) yesterday. I work outdoors in Ag and yesterday I drank a gallon and a quarter of water (4.73L) and did not have to pee once while working. \n\nLuckily spring was very wet so hay production will be okay but it looks like the good times are over for the rest of summer. \n\nIs it going to take a major grid failure for people to wake up to our new realities? What is the tipping point for mass acceptance that the world we knew has died? \n\nIn the process of limewashing my brick house to increase its albedo. My hope is in a few years to sell and build something off grid that\u2019s smaller and more suited to the new realities of extreme weather and heat. Maybe with a nice porch with which to watch everything go up in flames.",
            "Location Asheville NC USA\n\nNC passed a mask ban where customers can be told to remove their masks when entering a business.  Citizens can also call the police if they deem the person suspicious.  This basically gives people the right to harass anyone wearing a mask.  I was reading a story about a women with cancer that was refused service at a auto care business becasue she wouldn't remove her mask.  Covid is on the rise here.  I live in a fairly big city so I have options to go to another business but for people in rural areas where there is only one grocery or only one auto repair business they don't have options.  This is a very cruel law.  I contine masking even though it's illegal now.  I moved here in the last year and I would't have come to NC if I know they were going to make this law as I am immunocompromised.",
            "Location: SE Ireland \n\nFirst cut of the two small Hayfields at the back of the house, normally by this time of year there would have been 2 cuts possibly 3 some years, resulting in an average yield of 25 - 30 hay bales annually, like I said they're small fields\n\nThis year we got SEVEN in total\n\nAnd that is repeated in fields around the area\n\nThere are no new Potato stalls on the road yet, and the strawberries are scarce enough too.\n\nAnything that was planted this year was planted late, and a lot of it is not weathering well"

He charts the rise of polarisation and fascism in a terrifyingly realistic way.\n\nThe Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson is a similar near future charting collapse. It\u2019s slightly more hopeful and covers an almost believable (on a good day) best case scenario. It\u2019s more European focused, but starts with an Indian heatwave that kills millions which seems completely and devastatingly likely.",

Forster explores the loss of human connection, both human to human, and to the Earth itself. As the technology that provides for their every need frees humanity to busy themselves exploring \"ideas\" with each other using technology ,like our internet. Emerging from this, instead of enlightenment, critical thinking skills are suppressed as society turns toward superstition and apathy. Inevitably, due to the loss of skills needed to maintain the machine, humanity finds itself helpless as the machine stops.\n\nYou can read it here:\n\n[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/\\~koehl/Teaching/ECS188/PDF\\_files/Machine\\_stops.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjWnvCwrPSGAxVF8MkDHViYCIgQFnoECEQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw09oAiDOzsUXH0-ydN8K3wN](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS188/PDF_files/Machine_stops.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjWnvCwrPSGAxVF8MkDHViYCIgQFnoECEQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw09oAiDOzsUXH0-ydN8K3wN)"

We can't even get off the worst of the fuels, what hope have we of avoiding 5\u00b0c rise in temps by 2070?\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1dqv86l/record_year_every_year/laqtoki/",
            "More destructive emissions have been released in the past less than four decades than in all of modern history before that.  The rate of pollution and destruction is increasingly increasing.",
            "SS. In the first six months of 2024, more money was invested in renewable energy than on fossil fuels, sounds great right? Wrong. Coal is so cheap now that developing nations can't resist it. But hey, most developed nations used coal so who are we to judge?

            "I remember finding out in my 20s that more than half of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, had occurred since I had been born. \n\nAnd this is probably also true for everyone born since then as the rate of emissions continues to accelerate..",

            "Yes, developing nations that are attempting to modernize are burning cheap coal. Can you blame them? The West has set a standard of living that everyone else wants to achieve, and coal is the easiest starter fuel. We *could* warn them of the dangers, but why would they listen when we refuse to curb our own fuel consumption? For Pete's sake, we're spinning up AI server farms left and right. We keep building new roads and new cars. We're still burying Ghana under literal tons of discarded fast fashion and the entire ocean in empty Coke bottles. The US refuses to compromise one iota to address climate change. So who are we to insist that others do better?\n\nThe hypocrisy serves no one.",

            "This year, we are already solidly above 1.5 C warming with 2023 being a notably hotter year than the warming trend by a good margin-- and the first half of 2024 another remarkable bump hotter again.\n\n\nIn messaging around 2050, the \"moderate\" case warming was formerly held to be around 2 C. That is 26 years from 2024.
