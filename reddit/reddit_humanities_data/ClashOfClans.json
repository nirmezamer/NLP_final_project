            "For strong heros you need both ores and upgraded heros. The tricky part here is that war is a large source for ores (one of the very few sources). It's annoying that you are in a major disadvantage when upgrading your heros during war. Grinding for ores and grinding for hero levels are both major aspects of the game and are currently separated by war. Imo, now after the equipment update, SC should do something about the 2 separate grinds and bring them more together",

            "I'm in th14 almost max and I was done with the hero upgrading in 2 months(f2p) when i reached th14, i did all the GW upgrade with books and hammer",
            "I am about to max my Th14 (f2p) and I never felt this was a major issue. I mostly use books for warden and queen whereas I don't find much problem in keeping RC and King down sometimes.\n\nOn my Th12 account I put 2 of my heroes for upgrade constantly still I am able to 3 star 80% of the time after the massive nerf at TH12. I am able to do LaLo with just the Queen Charge without the Warden and the King.\n\nThis may seem like an absurd thought but actually putting 1 or 2 of your heroes down can push you to better strategize so that their absence isn't much of an issue."
