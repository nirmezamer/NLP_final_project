            "I am interested in trying the 4 am waking-up thing. I tried it one day, and even though it was good, I didn't think it would suit my situation. \n\nSo I am living alone and I am a solopreneur. Apart from work, I got food to make, a house to clean, and other chores. These things take a lot of my time, and it gets hard to actually focus on the work. For example, when I woke up at 4 am, I worked from 4-9 am. Then I cleaned the house and got to prep for lunch. All this took me 5 hours. So now I have a few hours before I sleep at 8 pm. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I think I need to cut down on those 5 hours, but honestly, making food takes a bit of time lol. Any advice is appreciated.",
            "I have the motivation and headspace of a tea spoon and are looking for apps that can kick my butt.\n\n\n\nI have tried Habitica and Finch, but I just add the tasks I already do and it kinda takes away the point. I like the concept of the apps with RPG elements, but I am looking for something that can just give me tasks. Like, \"Hey, I think this is the time for you to clean the bathroom - you have three days\"\n\n  \nDoes something like this exist?",
            "I tried the 4am wake up over a month period and found I was tired in the afternoon.  Now I get up at 5am and I feel better for having that extra hour sleep.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that I have personally done:\n\n1 - Priortise my goals - Trying to do everything means I personally get stressed, overwhelmed and generally procrastinate.  I have had to learn to prioritise a few things rather than loads.  Focus on fewer areas where you can put more effort into it.\n\n2 - I paid for a cleaner to clean my house.  It was the best thing I did. It gave me back so much time.\n\n3 - Do what is right for you, not what everyone else says to do.  I'm slowly learning to listen to my body and intuition more and I'm seeing such a difference.  So 5am work for some but not for others.  \n\nHope that helps.  If you want more help message me.",

            "Thank you for the advice. It's the second day and I feel productive enough. It's a little hard to sleep at 8pm because maybe my body is used to sleeping around 11 pm - 12 am. I wish I could hire cleaning people or cook, but I am considering it for the future. And yass! I am listening to my body, therapy really taught me this. I am not being hard on myself. I am just trying to experiment.",
