            "I know that my mornings are when I'm most productive. However, I don't feel like I get enough done in the morning. \n\nHere's my focus routine: 9:00-11:30, 13:30-16:30, 19:30-21:00.\n\nI was thinking of waking up earlier (I sleep for 9 hours starting at 10pm). But 9 hours of sleep feels most natural to me.\n\nAny tips or recommendations?",
            "I've been kinda lazy my whole life, managed to get away with it in school and still did decently well. \n\nNow that I've been working in one role for 3 years, I've realised that I have almost nothing to show for it. My role is almost exclusively WFH which makes it easier to laze around and not do anything. I probably work 8 hours a week and my boss hasn't noticed anything. \n\nI really wanna snap out of it, but don't know where or how to start. Any advice would be appreciated ",
            ">I sleep for 9 hours starting at 10pm\n\nSo you get up at 7am?  \n\nHow do you currently spend your time between 7am and 9am? That's an entire two hours during your most-productive period. Maybe you could shift some items that don't require focus to later in the day, and free up more time in your mornings.",
            "In the morning I spend around 15 minutes meditating + morning stretches. Afterwards I go for a 30 minute morning walk. By the time I get back I have breakfast and shower. I finish all this by 8:30 on average.\n\nFor the remaining half an hour I do small tasks such as reading emails/messages and engaging in LinkedIn/Reddit/Facebook. \n\nRecently I found myself spending more time for the smaller tasks, resulting in me doing more intense work at 9:15 or 9:30.\n\nDo you have any advice on how I can optimize this?"

        "content": "for as long as I can remember I was a napper. In highschool I would nap everyday in algebra 2 and if I didn't get that nap I would sleep in another class. If I didn't get that opportunity I would lie to go to the nurses office to be able to lie down and nap. When I got my first job, I use to go to the breakroom during my shift to put my head down and just take a nap. I never realized it was bad until freshman year of college when my romates commented on how often I sleep. I always brushed it off for having a bad sleep schedule and being depressed etc. Even now, I'm not currently working, only taking a few classes this summer, and will spend about 6 hours of my day at school, come home, take the dog out, and immediately go for a nap. It completely ruins my day because I usually will end up waking up at around 8-9 when the rest of my household comes home then I'm screwed for the night (not really because I love sleep). But its like as hard as I try I can never last a full day awake. I have days where I plan to stay awake for the day because I have things to do I have to literally tell my brain no nap today no nap today no nap today and still en up falling asleep. If I'm not up and doing a physical activity like going to the gym or cooking its over for me. If I even lie down in bed for a lil to scroll on social media or go to the living room I'm knocked out in 15 mins.\n\nLast night I literally fell asleep on the floor because I was fighting demons trying not to sleep on the couch so I thought ok let me sit on the floor and watch tv... lol did not work\n\nHow tf does everyone last a full day I cant do it",
