            "What do teens themselves think of social media and efforts around understanding its dangers? What are there ideas around reducing usage; what are their thoughts when presented with info on negative mental health effects of social media? Do they buy it?",
            "Are any specific social media apps more harmful than others? And is there any info on what type of social media use is worse than others is scrolling through videos better or worse than messaging, for example?",
            "Do you see a shift in the way parents and teens are approaching social media use, and is there an economic disparity in approach if so?",
            "What responsibility do you think we have on a public policy level to address your concerns? Do you think laws banning or limiting teenager access to these platforms could even be effective, let alone a good idea in the first place? I'm strongly of two minds on this subject, would really like to know what you think!",
            "Q to **Dr. Bickham**: Are you comfortable with the title of this post, which makes it sound like the AMA is with two AP beat reporters? Were you involved in this decision? (If not, would you have preferred a title that focused more on the expertise that you can uniquely provide?)",
            "How many of the negatives are so ingrained into social media from the start? I havent used some popular sites social media in over 10 years and the dark patterns definitely existed then. Can social media where most interactions are with people we dont know be healthy while still filtering content to be what were interested in?",
            "Any general suggestions to parents? What to look out for, what to do when the topic comes up with younger children, or even just general best practices?",
            "Do you see evidence or believe that certain major events or daily interactions would have been/be drastically without the presence of social media? Do the kids you talk to ever consider this? \n\nFor example, the recent campus protests. Protest happens, but did the drive to make content change the nature of SOME (not all but some) of the protesters to possibly go to greater lengths to stand out on social media? And what about more every day interactions? Do teens feel that arguments/incidents being filmed and posted are keeping people in check or do they see how it may distort the full version of what happened? I guess this is just a \"how much of social media do they see as real life\" question?",
            "At what point should society as a whole ban these types of applications because of the visible damage they do?   Can you picture a social media app that wouldnt have detrimental effects, and what might that look like?",
            "I would assume its very difficult on teens to see David Grusch on TV testifying in Congress, and then the other half of government saying nothings real., \n\nGaslighting the civilian population with mixed statements"

This ruling just made this so much worse. Nobody is looking after us. Congress isnt and wont, because corporations keep them in office and regulatory capture is the norm.",

They are saying that judge (who know the law but seemingly little else) should have the final say on how to achieve clean drinking water, and yet throughout the entire document refer to \"nitrous oxide\" when the point they are making should clearly reference \"nitrogen oxides.\"\n\nThat rulling was combed over by law school graduates clering at the highset level of our judicial system, and are so ignoraant they confuse laughing gas with a toxic chemical *and thought they were correct.*",

All it will take is some idiot judge somewhere to wipe out an entire industry because he decided that the statute that created the agency didnt vest in them the authority to regulate that specific thing and a Supreme Court that allows the ruling to stand because they cant be bothered to evaluate all the cases that will be coming. We are so utterly screwed by these assholes. Libertarian hellscape will eventually give way to corporate oligarchy disguised as a Christian theocracy.",
