            "What do teens themselves think of social media and efforts around understanding its dangers? What are there ideas around reducing usage; what are their thoughts when presented with info on negative mental health effects of social media? Do they buy it?",
            "Are any specific social media apps more harmful than others? And is there any info on what type of social media use is worse than others\u2026 is scrolling through videos better or worse than messaging, for example?",
            "**EDIT: That's all the time that we have for today.  Thank you for joining us!**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the relationship kids have with social media, which has become a space that teenagers increasingly turn to for socializing, trying out emerging identities and seeking advice. As the risk of mental health problems has risen with the time youth spend online, we looked at ways that parents, experts and young adults themselves have suggested to navigate better between digital and non-digital worlds. ***Join us today, June 18, at 12 p.m. ET.***\n\n**Who is here:**\n\n* Expert: Dr. David Bickham research director at Boston Children's Hospital's Digital Wellness Lab. Bickham\u2019s research explores media as an environmental factor that can influence children\u2019s physical, psychological, social, and academic well-being.\n* Barbara Ortutay, a technology reporter at the AP.\n* Jocelyn Gecker, an education reporter at the AP.\n\n**More from the series:**\n\n* [Keeping children safe on social media: What parents should know to protect their kids](https://apnews.com/article/social-media-kids-teens-instagram-tiktok-parents-safety-45df57c32384207ffedc463870b8a6d2)",
            "Do you see a shift in the way parents and teens are approaching social media use, and is there an economic disparity in approach if so?",
            "What responsibility do you think we have on a public policy level to address your concerns? Do you think laws banning or limiting teenager access to these platforms could even be effective, let alone a good idea in the first place? I'm strongly of two minds on this subject, would really like to know what you think!",
            "As a millennial, I\u2019ve been able to be right in the middle of social media\u2019s exploding popularity and was caught up in the \u201csocial status\u201d of it growing up. I was worried about friends/followers/what I posted and how people would view me. \n\nAs I got older, I got out of that thought process and began to avoid it like the plague. It began to seem like a rat race to me that I wasn\u2019t interested in and looking back, can definitely see some of the mental health effects y\u2019all wrote about. \n\n*My question is, with it still being in the infancy of what we know about the long term effects, what can be done to address its impacts?* I just saw something recently about wanting to pair a warning with negative effects of social media just like smoking. \n\nI just turned 30 and have eradicated most social media. I recently got back on IG and the reels reel me in sometimes. *But more than anything, what I realize now is that the former want to check social media and what\u2019s new has proliferated into everyday life. I\u2019ll check my phone constantly now, that has minimal social media, like you check the fridge over and over again hoping something you want is in there* \n\n*Are there plans to look at long term negative effects down the road of social media/technology and its impact on teens as they grow older?*",
            "Q to **Dr. Bickham**: Are you comfortable with the title of this post, which makes it sound like the AMA is with two AP beat reporters? Were you involved in this decision? (If not, would you have preferred a title that focused more on the expertise that you can uniquely provide?)",
            "How many of the negatives are so ingrained into social media from the start? I haven\u2019t used some popular sites social media in over 10 years and the dark patterns definitely existed then. Can social media where most interactions are with people we don\u2019t know be healthy while still \u201cfiltering\u201d content to be what we\u2019re interested in?",
            "Any general suggestions to parents? What to look out for, what to do when the topic comes up with younger children, or even just general best practices?",
            "Do you see evidence or believe that certain major events or daily interactions would have been/be drastically without the presence of social media? Do the kids you talk to ever consider this? \n\nFor example, the recent campus protests. Protest happens, but did the drive to make content change the nature of SOME (not all but some) of the protesters to possibly go to greater lengths to stand out on social media? And what about more every day interactions? Do teens feel that arguments/incidents being filmed and posted are keeping people in check or do they see how it may distort the full version of what happened? I guess this is just a \"how much of social media do they see as real life\" question?"
