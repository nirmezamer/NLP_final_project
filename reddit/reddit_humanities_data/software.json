I think MS is trying too hard to turn Teams into a super app. You can open Words or Excel files directly in Teams, for example, and theoretically work on them together. Outlook has now also been integrated into the new version. New appointments are displayed directly in Teams. I think it's just too much and sometimes it doesn't work properly for me. The biggest problem I keep having, however, is joining a voice chat because the room is not displayed when you look in the channel. And it's always random, whether it's there or not."

Most converters show popup ads that cause viruses to enter their devices. So, I created an ad-free, safe, easy-to-use converter with more features than other available converters.\n\nI created EzMP3, which is safe to use and does not have ads. I cover server costs through coffee donations.\n\nI have added the option to trim the audio from the start and end. You can also select the quality, up to 320kbps.\n\nYou can read reviews about it on Trustpilot.\n\nGive it a try, and I hope you will love it!",
