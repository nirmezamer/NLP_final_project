Does progression towards picked artifacts, unique weapons and flashdrives carry on between multiple playthroughs in Clear sky?? For ex: If getting the 25 different artifacts is rng based and I can only get 22 on my first playthrough, can I try getting the last 3 on a new game and will i keep my earlier progress towards it ? I also have 17/18 flashdrives but cant get the last one because of a glitch on console , can I start a new game and get the last one only or do i have to get everything in a single playthrough ?",
