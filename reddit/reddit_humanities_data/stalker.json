            "Playing Anomaly GAMMA for the first time. While traveling to Jupiter, from Army Warehouses via Red Forrest, there was a Sin/Monolith mine encampment before the path leading to Jupiter.\n\nI was packed full 600HP and 300+AP 5.45x39mm bullets and wasted most of it. I survived barely and by the time I arrived in Yanov station I'm now almost empty, only 50ish HPs left, only to find out that Yanov has only NATO merchants. Where can I by Russian ammo in Jupiter?\n\nI have a backup, shotgun with me but still, I would like to avoid going back the Bar or wherever to restock on ammo.\n\nEdit: On another note I believe like something is missing at this place in Yanov.  There's Ashot, who is a NATO merchant. Then there are three other mechanic merchants, ironically one of them is a one of the professors at the mobile science lab (*seriously doc, you're selling hardware now?*), and two others are the Loners, Nitro and Cardan in Yanov. Who needs three mechanics really?? One of them could've easly been a Russian supplies merchant.",

            "Hello everyone, I\u2019m trying to 100% Cs after being done with Soc. Does progression towards picked artifacts, unique weapons and flashdrives carry on between multiple playthroughs in Clear sky?? For ex: If getting the 25 different artifacts is rng based and I can only get 22 on my first playthrough, can I try getting the last 3 on a new game and will i keep my earlier progress towards it ? I also have 17/18 flashdrives but can\u2019t get the last one because of a glitch on console , can I start a new game and get the last one only or do i have to get everything in a single playthrough ?"
