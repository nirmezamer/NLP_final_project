These posts are very niche, and possibly triggering for some people. We have amended our rules to include the ban of Therapy dump posts. Some examples of these are.\n\n\"Undiagnosed depression starterpack\"\n\"Depressive college semester starterpack\"\n\"Undiagnosed (Illness here) starterpack\"\n\"(Mental health diagnosis) starterpack\".\n\nThese posts often touch on sensitive topics which other may not wish to see.\n\nIf you are having mental health problems, its best to talk to a professional rather than take it out on r/starterpacks \n\n\n2nd type of posts that have been a problem here.\n\nVentPacks.\n \nThese posts are essentially rants from people after having a bad day which usually involves bigotry or the comment section divolges into bigotry.\n\nFor example these starterpacks go something like this.\n\n\n\"The guy she chose over you starterpack\"\n\"The teacher who failed you in science class\" (When its just an extremely niche starterpack that really only applies to OP)\n\n\n\nWe want r/starterpacks to be fun and engaging. We dont want to hurt peoples mental health and we don't want bigotry on our subreddit because it is not nice.\n\n\nHappy Starterpacking!",
