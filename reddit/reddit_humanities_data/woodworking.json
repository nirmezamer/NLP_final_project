            "I think this thread needs a sticky for best practices when asking for wood ID help. Suggest:\n\n1. If possible, clean up the wood with a plane (or chisel for the end grain) so that we can see the grain clearly. \n2. Include a close-up picture of the end grain. Not blurry. End grain pore structure is one of the most useful bits of info for wood ID. \n3. Note any non-visual distinguishing characteristics. Does the wood feel particularly light or particularly dense? Does it have an odor when planed? \n4. Include multiple pictures or text info as sub-comments under a main picture, not as an avalanche of first-level comments.",

Has a big knot and minor void but I feel like it might still work in this application. Thoughts?",

            "This sideboard is my first \u201ereal\u201d furniture project and was built from pre-laminated oak boards from Osmo. After weeks of on-off-work on this project I can safely say, that I will never build anything out of this material again. The wood had a lot of little cracks that needed to be filled in a time consuming process and there was way to much sapwood in it, that additionally had a few bug holes. It should normally been kiln-dried prior to any sale, but I did not want to go with any risk, so I fumed everything after assembly. I was not satisfied with the look of this sapwood-heartwood-mess so I painted the outer surface black. My original intend was to texturize the front panels of the drawers by carving to give this furniture a bit of individuality but I decided against it and made the middle section a compartment for the amplifier. The drawers got undermounted push-to-open slides.\n\nFor the finish I mixed Linseed-oil and Carnauba-wax by heating the oil and applied it while it was still hot. I buffed the mixture in with a towel and a hot air gun and wiped the excess off with fresh towels. I am not really satisfied with the outcome but learned a lot in the process of building and it will still be a perfect piece to store all my future vinyls in.",
            "Looks great! Nice work. \n\nOne thing to watch out for is that amplifier (?) should have more breathing room or it can over heat. I have a similar setup and I bought some cooling fans like you have in a desktop computer. Place them on top of the unit. They can be activated with a temperature sensor so they will turn on automatically and you don\u2019t have to think about it. Very quiet and I hardly know they\u2019re there.",
            "Outstanding !",
            "Thank you for your kind words and the advise! I will look for a cooling solution!",
            "not anymore, modern MosFETs temp isn't like in the 1970s",
            "chill out, your amp is okay. Looks like you have more than an inch. Convection and the open front back are enough. Unless it is a tube amp, MosFETs are okay with an inch with open front back too.",
            "That\u2019s why I wrote \u201cwatch for\u201d and not \u201cyour amp WILL catch fire\u201d. Just put your hand on it and if it\u2019s hot, consider cooling. Or read the manual and see what it says about ventilation.\n\nI have a Parasound A23 with. MOSFET driver stage and it runs hot. Manual makes a big deal about ventilation. I don\u2019t know what model the OP has but I recommend checking for heat.",
