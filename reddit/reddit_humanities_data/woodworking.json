            "Not a wood id question but no mega thread so here goes: Would you use a knotty scrap of hardwood for your vise chop? I made a 5/4 chop out of some maple but not as thick as I would want but I do have an appropriately sized scrap of 4/4 white oak I can laminate to it. Has a big knot and minor void but I feel like it might still work in this application. Thoughts?",

            "what's good wood to use for carving figurines etc in australia?",
            "I'm new to woodworking, I'm wondering what wood to buy, I understand what hardwood to buy like oak, pine and maple but for example a jewellery box I'm trying to build, would I buy like 12mm plywood? Or decking or what? Also, what finish would I use? Oil, polyurethane or varnish. Thanks",
            "$450 for Festool TS 55 REQ-F-Plus with Systainer but no tracks. Looks like great condition. \n\nGood deal?",
            "Hey guys, long time youtube watcher and hobby wood worker, I just came across a free program that helped me plan out how to make all my cuts on plywood and seems like a huge time and money saver for me. I wont link it here because im not trying to promote anything.  Im wondering if there are any other computer programs or just non tool recommendations that people have for things that they use that might not normally get talked about here. Maybe thats a dumb question, but im no professional and always looking to learn more. Thanks!",
            "Any chance you can identify the orange color wood as well? And Thanks, that lacewood is hard as stone , geez.",
            "So I am currently in the middle of anarchist workbench build and was going off his book but I realized this morning I may have made a huge mistake. I have cut the mortises for the short across braces so the laminated part of the leg is facing out. This worries me because I plan on putting in a leg vice and I dont know if putting that into a laminated edge vs a face edge. To fix this I have 2 options I can re print the leg assembly I havent put together but then the legs wont match but more importantly neither will the directions of the motives in the top which just seems like Im asking for trouble. Or I can cut off the short brace in the other assembly cut out the tenon and reorient both. Am I over thinking this or do I need to do one of these options?",
