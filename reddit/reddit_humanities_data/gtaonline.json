        "content": "Once again we find ourselves with an inbound update for GTA Online, the Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC. For new people who plan on checking in here on DLC day I want to go over how we usually handle those busy first few hours and general posting requirements on that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. About 30 minutes or so before the DLC releases (\\~4AM EDT) we will lock down the sub. What this means is that we will be filtering posts to help control the flood of posts we normally get in the opening hours so a ton of repetitive stuff and \"Is the dlc out yet?\" posts don't takeover the timeline.\n2. When the DLC releases will will post a Megathread and will be directing most repetitive posts to it. We will work to approve posts as quickly as possible with the first posts on specific DLC discussions being approved. The Megathread will be updated with information as it becomes available, like what platforms the update has been released to already and other information on what we got on launch day.\n3. **SPOILER TAGS MUST BE USED** on all posts discussing missions, characters, and especially plot points for the first 24 hours. Any posts without spoiler tags that contain any of the above listed content may be removed. \n4. **Dripfeed content that gets datamined MUST HAVE A SPOILER TAG** or the post will be removed.\n\nOne more thing, we will be offering a limited time flair for people who come by the sub on DLC release Day (June 25th). \n\n[Limited Time Flair](https://preview.redd.it/amqnalskvy7d1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d31fd4696a0a6e84b97ae511d9a863236e733f)\n\n**To get the flair you will need to do the following:**\n\n* Go to the DLC Megathread we will have pinned on June 25th at 5AM EDT\n* Go to the pinned comment on that post that will also have these instructions\n* Reply to that pinned comment with **#bountyhunter**\n* You'll get an automod PM telling you the flair has been changed\n* Refresh the page to see the flair applied\n\nThis flair will only be available to claim for 24 hours after the DLC is released, so it will end at about 5AM EDT on June 26th. After which the flair will no longer be available to get. \n\n**PLEASE NOTE:**\n\n**If you decide later to change the flair you will not be able to get the Bounty Hunter flair back.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check our pinned [Community Link Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/about/sticky) for links to the most current DLC information.\n\n&#x200B;",
