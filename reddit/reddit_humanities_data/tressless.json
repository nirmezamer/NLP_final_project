My oldest brother is bald but my sister and my second older brother have a full head of hair, they\u2019re in their 40\u2019s too. Except my second oldest brother who\u2019s 49 just started balding in his crown but his hairline is ok. What can I do? I\u2019m not open to minoxidil and fin.",

            "Been experiencing a little crown thinning and hairline corners receding at 22, and have heard that the sooner I get started the better. I\u2019ve seen some stories about shedding happening for up to 9 months, while I have a cousin who uses just Rogaine and has been regrowing hair after 2 months. Just wanted to ask around and see what everyone\u2019s experience is like here.",

            "I took the Hims Min+Fin (.3% Fin, 6% Min) spray for a week at recommended dosage (4 sprays) and developed breast pain and nipple sensitivity as well as an ache in my right testicle. I stopped and the sides ceased after two days. Now I'm debating whether I should dilute the spray and try again or just go with only Minoxidil instead. I'm 23 with a Norwood 3 hairline and very little crown thinning which looks like a normal whorl.",
            "Hey everyone I need some advice.\n\nI think I am going to start going on min and fin however I have a problem relating to whether should I start now if I am going to a wedding next month. I have heard minoxidil causes shedding of the hair and obviously, I don't want to go to a wedding and get photos taken while in the deepest part of the shedding phase so what are you'll guys' thoughts or suggestions should I jump on it now or wait until after the wedding to start treatment?",
