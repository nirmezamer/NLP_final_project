I had no idea who Kim Kardashian was at the time (2014) and that had no influence on the name.\nShe now hates her first name and wants to change it. She likes \"Rainbow\" like her favorite My Little Pony Rainbow Dash\n\nI'm looking for opinions for changing a child's name at this age where her school, friends, and family all know her as Kim, to something that sounds like a 10 year old chose it. I have been telling her that she'll need to wait and change it as an adult but should I let my elementary aged child pick her own name and change it legally?",
