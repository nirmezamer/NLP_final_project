The game is cross-gen however, so if you play PS4 you can continue on PS5.\n\n**Q) If I buy a next-gen console, can I play with friends on old-gen consoles?**\n\n> Yes! The game is backwards compatible on console, so you can play with friends on PS4/PS5 or XB1/XBX\n\n**Q) If I already own Red Dead Redemption 2, do I need to buy Red Dead Online again when it goes standalone?**\n\n> No! Red Dead Online is still part of the RDR2 game.\n\n---\n\n### Red Dead Online: General Questions\n\n**Q) What are the currencies in Red Dead Online?**\n\n> Cash, the main currency in RDO that is earned through almost every activity.\n\n> Gold Bars, the *premium currency* in RDO that can be purchased using real money. You earn a small amount of gold for completing activities online.\n\n> Role Tokens, earned by levelling up in each role, used to unlock abilities & items for the five current roles.\n\n**Q) What is the Outlaw pass?**\n\n> The Outlaw Pass is an in-game purchase using the premium Gold currency that allows you to earn items/rewards as you level up.\n\n> Outlaw Pass are only available for a limited time and once they finish, you can't access them again.\n\n**Q) What are Daily Challenges?**\n\n> Every day at 6am UTC, you are given a new list of 7 daily challenges as well as 15 role daily challenges. They can range from hunting specific animals or finding certain herbs, to completing PVP/Freeroam events. \n\n> Initially, you earn 0.1 Gold per completed challenge plus a bonus if you complete all 7 regular challenges.\n\n> After completing at least 1 challenge per day for 7 days, you then earn a little more gold per challenge each week before your daily challenge streak resets after 28 days.\n\n> Your daily challenge streak will then reset, and you start the process again.\n\n> In addition to this, there are also 3 daily challenges for each role available and you can do a max of 9 role daily challenges. Daily challenges for roles will also differ depending on your rank within each role.\n\n**Q) What are Free-roam events (role/normal)**\n\n> Every 45 minutes, you'll receive an invite to a free-roam event. Free-roam events can be activities such as fishing, horse racing, archery competitions, or PVP. You earn XP + cash for completing. \n\n> There are also role specific events that happen every 90 minutes, you need to be ranked up and enrolled in each role before you'll see invites for these activities.\n\n> [You can see the schedule for free-roam & role events here](https://www.richardwestenra.com/rdr2-free-roam-event-schedule/)\n\n**Q) What are ability cards?**\n\n> Abilities in Red Dead Online are assigned to a character through Ability Cards. These are divided into two different types. Dead Eye cards that grant abilities only active during Dead Eye, while Passive cards add abilities that are always active, no matter what you do. Passive abilities are further divided into several different categories.\n\n> In Red Dead Online, it's not possible to assign all of the available abilities to the character, as there are only 4 slots available. One slot is used for a single Dead Eye card, while the remaining three slots are used for Passive abilities. ^^^^[Source](https://www.rdr2.org/guides/ability-cards-guide/).\n\n**Q) What are the playing styles online?**\n\n> **Defensive:** Players in Defensive mode will be indicated by a shield icon, will take reduced damage from enemy players, cannot be lassoed, melee attacked, executed or targeted with auto-aim. Defensive players will also be excluded from being targeted in PvP-related missions such as Player Assassination. \n> Those who attack Defensive players receive hefty penalties via the Hostility system, while players who initiate conflict while in Defensive mode will be instantly pulled out of Defensive mode and also receive similar Hostility penalties.\n\n> **Offensive:** The Offensive playing style is set as the default and is how most players traditionally interact in Free Roam \u2013 free to engage in hostile contact with other players if you are prepared to accept the potential consequences. \n\n---\n\n### Red Dead Online: Other Questions\n\n**Q) How do I dual wield?**\n\n> At rank 25, you can buy an off-hand holster which allows you to equip a second handgun.\n\n**Q) How do I change appearance**\n\n> Press Left on the D Pad (Keyboard TBC) to bring the Online menu up > Scroll down to Online Options > Scroll down to Change Appearance\n\n**Q) How do I setup camp**\n\n> Press Left on the D Pad (Keyboard TBC) to bring the Online menu up > Scroll down to camp options > Choose location for camp\n\n> Camps can be used to access wardrobes, collect items you've ordered via the catalog, craft & cook and fast travel if upgraded. \n\n> A small camp is suitable for 1-4 posse members and costs $1 per in game day. A large camp is suitable for 1-7 posse members and costs $2 per in game day.\n\n**Q) Where is the gun locker?**\n\n> You unlock it through the trader role, then purchase it at Wilderness Outfitters in camp, and then it appears at your specific tent in camp.\n\n**Q) How do I buy a dog?**\n\n> At your camp, head to Cripps and access Wilderness Outfitters, from there you can select the dog option.\n\n**Q) What can dogs be used for?**\n\n> Looking cool at your camp and warning you of camp raids when you unlock the perk. Not really much else. (They're not companions like Dogmeat from Fallout 4)\n\n**Q) I saw an item, but can't find it on PC or Xbox One.**\n\n> Some items are exclusive to PS4, so you may see things promoted by Rockstar that aren't yet available on your platform or it may be from an old Outlaw Pass.\n\n**Q) What is the best Horse**\n\n> [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/gvz86q/semicomprehensive_guide_to_horses_in_rdo/) should help.\n\n**Q) What are the best Weapons**\n\n> [Captain Balrick's arsenal should help you decide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iYfk68DYfok33M1Hp-bkItUUqk_PS0PLkz5-AtnY3dI/edit)\n\n**Q) What is the best ability card loadout**\n\n> [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/casrm3/red_dead_online_player_guide_ability_cards/) in the /r/RedDeadOnline mega-guide should help.\n\n**Q) What is the best way to make money/gold**\n\n> [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/k32mcp/best_way_to_get_gold_bars_without_paying_irl_money/ge1itdt/) should help.\n\n**Q) Where are the treasure maps located?**\n\n> You can [find them all here.](https://reddeadnews.com/red-dead-treasure-maps/)\n\n---\n\n# Red Dead Online: Roles\n\n**Q) Can I have more than 1 role active?**\n\n> Yes! You can play in all roles concurrently. \n\n---\n\n### Bounty Hunter Role\n\n**Q) What is the Bounty Hunter role?**\n\n> Get started as a Bounty Hunter when you meet the Legendary Bounty Hunter in Rhodes and purchase the Bounty Hunter License. The standard cost is 15 Gold Bars.\n\n> Licensed Bounty Hunters can pick up work by visiting bounty boards located near law offices, post offices and train stations across the states. There is no shortage of criminals to be dealt with and the targets range in difficulty, from lone low-level petty thieves to notorious outlaws with armed protection details and a watchful eye. Taking on an armed gang or bringing multiple targets to justice is made easier with the help of a Posse, who will all earn a cut of the final bounty. And keep in mind, bringing in targets alive will yield a greater reward.\n\n> Reaching Bounty Hunter Rank 12 will open up the opportunity to take down other players with high bounties of $20 or more. Bounty Hunters will be notified through an invite about the opportunity to hunt down the wanted player when they\u2019re nearby in a structured pursuit. The wanted player must escape (or surrender) within the allotted time and if captured, they\u2019ll also have opportunities to escape and flee. If the Bounty Hunter brings the target in alive, they\u2019ll receive an award while the criminal serves time.\n\n**Q) What are legendary bounties?**\n\n> Legendary bounties are *high-tier* bounties, they usually involve a mini-story/cut scene. They're also much tougher than a regular bounty.\n\n> There are 10 legendary bounties that can be access as part of the Bounty Hunter role and 3 that can be accessed (when they've all released) by purchasing the Prestigious Bounty Hunter upgrade.\n\n---\n\n### Trader Role\n\n**Q) What is the Trader role?**\n\n> our trusted camp companion, Cripps, has long dreamed of starting a trading outpost and you\u2019re going to help him make it happen - by becoming a partner in the fledgling Cripps Trading Company. Combining Cripps\u2019 lifetime of working with animal materials and your skills at hunting and frontier security, you\u2019ll have the perfect ingredients to develop a thriving business. \n\n> Once you agree to help Cripps, you can start turning your camp into a business by sourcing items for Cripps to convert into sellable goods. An investment of 15 Gold Bars to purchase a Butcher\u2019s Table will get your business up and running.\n\n> Once you\u2019re operational, you\u2019ll provide Cripps with Materials through hunting animals \u2013 pristine pelts and carcasses will provide better yields. You\u2019ll also take on Resupply Missions to acquire additional necessities through less than savory tactics. Once supplied, Cripps will begin turning the materials into sellable goods, which can then be sent out on low-risk local deliveries for payment or across greater distances for a premium. \n\n> Improve your hunting yields with a Hunting Wagon for larger hauls or upgrade your Delivery Wagons for larger sales. As business flourishes and your presence becomes known in the market, your competition may grow jealous of your success, so keep an eye out for raids on your camp. As your trade grows, you might consider purchasing a camp dog from Wilderness Outfitters. Not only are dogs great camp companions for all players, but a Trader of sufficient rank can teach their dog to warn of incoming attacks.\n\n**Q) Can I skip the medium wagon?**\n\n> No, you need to buy the medium wagon, then the large wagon. \n\n**Q) What can I sell to Cripps?**\n\n> You can sell carcasses & small animals (e.g squirrels). Along with some animal parts, e.g feathers.\n\n> Cripps does not accept meat, fish or skinned carcasses. \n\n**Q) How long does it take Cripps to make goods after resupplying?**\n\n> Cripps requires materials and supplies to produce goods.\n> You give him materials by donating carcasses and pelts. He uses two units of materials to produce one good.\n> You either buy supplies or obtain them through resupply missions. Either way, that gives enough supplies to produce 25 goods.\n> As long as both materials and supplies are available, Cripps produces 1 good every 2 minutes (1 in-game hour).\n\n---\n\n### Collector Role\n\n**Q) What is the Collector role?**\n\n> Seek out the mysterious travelling saleswoman Madam Nazar to acquire the Collector\u2019s Bag and get started on the path of the Collector. It will cost 15 Gold Bars for access to collecting and selling rare items.\n\n> With Madam Nazar\u2019s help, you will be able to explore the world finding valuable treasures, whether they\u2019re discarded Tarot cards in abandoned camps, buried treasures unearthed with your trusty shovel, hidden family heirlooms and more.\n\n> Collect individual pieces and sell them off directly to Madam Nazar or collect entire sets for even more valuable sales. As you progress, you\u2019ll unlock enhanced searching skills; more useful tools like a metal detector; benefits like increased carrying capacities; the ability for your horse to directly pluck and pass herbs to you while mounted, and more.\n\n**Q) Where is Madam Nazar?**\n\n> Madam Nazar can be located by completing a map/collection for her. Her location is posted daily on /r/RedDeadDailies - She changes location at 6am UTC time each day.\n\n> You can also find her using https://madamnazar.io/\n\n**Q) Who is Madam Nazar?**\n\n> Madam Nazar is the Collector role vendor, you can obtain maps, cosmetics & other items such as the shovel from her.\n\n**Q) Why is Madam Nazar?**\n\n> ...\n\n**Q) Where do you buy a shovel?**\n\n> From Madam Nazar, it costs $350. If you need help finding her, check /r/RedDeadDailies\n\n**Q) Where do you buy a metal detector?**\n\n> From Madam Nazar, it unlocks at level 5 and costs $700. If you need help finding her, check /r/RedDeadDailies\n\n**Q) Can you sell collector items individually or does it need to be a full set?**\n\n> Yes, however you get far less money than you would if you sold a full collection\n\n**Q) Can you only have one collector map active?**\n\n> Yes, if you try to open a second map, it may auto-close and almost looks like a bug, however, you should only try and activate one at any given time.\n\n---\n\n### Moonshiner Role:\n\n**Q)** I already met Maggie but I didn't buy a shack, now I can't find how to buy the shack?\n\n> In the options menu (left on the D-pad, or L on PC), select \"Camp & Properties\" \u2192 \"Moonshine Shack\" \u2192 \"Shack Location\".\n\nWill be expanded upon soon...\n\n---\n\n### Naturalist Role\n\nWill be updated soon...\n\n--- \n\n### Useful Red Dead Online Resources\n\n- /r/RedDeadDailies - A subreddit dedicated to sharing daily challenge information\n- /r/RedDeadCollector - The best place to ask for support with any locations for collector items.\n- [Collector map.](https://jeanropke.github.io/RDR2CollectorsMap/index-beta.html)\n- [/r/RedDeadOnline mega-guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/casme1/red_dead_online_player_guide_settings/).\n- [Free-roam event schedule](https://www.richardwestenra.com/rdr2-free-roam-event-schedule/)\n- [Red Dead Online Discord](http://discord.gg/reddeadonline)\n\n---\n\nThis thread will be posted reposted monthly on the 7th.

So I played it nice, just doing the wave emote and minding my business, and out of nowhere the started meeling me and shot me. Later I was riding along the tracks and two other players came from up head, so I decided to move of the tracks and let pass, as I was watching them pass, one of them turned back and started shooting at me and chasing me, I got away.

There are just people out there that want to start fights regardless of levels. Parley exists and I use it a lot. I have no interest in pvp. If it gets really bad, I switch sessions.
