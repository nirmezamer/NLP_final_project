            "# XDC DayZ | Vanilla Balance | Better bases | Helis | Winter\n\n**DEDICATED SERVER FOR PC**\n\nIP: [193.25.252.52](http://193.25.252.52) port 2302\n\n**Who are we?**\n\nXDC is a group of gamers who have been hosting various game servers over the years since we were founded in 1999.  In that time we have always been able to offer mature, experienced, and trusted admins, as well as a laid back community where everyone is welcome.\n\nCome and help build a new DayZ community! [https://discord.gg/fwMb7jZjyq](https://discord.gg/fwMb7jZjyq)\n\n**Overall goal**\n\nOur setup is guided by two main principles; we want an improved vanilla experience, and where possible we want to restore features from the original DayZ mod, which the standalone devs haven't gotten around to yet.  This means that we only add mods which enhance areas which we feel are weak in the vanilla game.  This includes improved base building and raid mechanics, a better variety of military items, and the addition of Helicopters. At the same time we are keeping the overall server economy as close to true Vanilla as we can, with all modded items added with vanilla balance in mind.\n\nAbove all though we are aiming to provide a DayZ experience which is as unrestricted as possible.  This is a sandbox game and we aim to protect that as best we can. To that end we are not imposing any unnecessary limits to bases or how you play, you can build any way you want to and as big a base as you want; and our setup is designed so that pretty much anything goes when it comes to pvp.\n\n**Mod highlights**\n\n* Base building plus, alongside vanilla base building, with territories to prevent enemies dismantling your base unless they can reach your flag.\n* New upkeep and decay system using an ingame currency to pay for maintenance of your base.  This makes it expensive to hoard all the best vehicles and helps prevent large bases becoming unraidable.\n* Expanded economy around the upkeep system, with some modded items such as ores that you can mine and refine, along with special items that can be sold for the currency required to keep your base going.  This adds new meta items for teams to seek out, while also promoting movement to more dangerous parts of the map where it is easier to find the most valuable items.  \n* C4 for raiding but balanced so that expensive buildings need more explosives to destroy.  Any buildable structure can be destroyed, but entrances are weaker than walls etc to promote better looking bases and allow players more options when designing their base.\n* Helicopters - These are available for the same currency used for upkeep, so while anyone can potentially get hold of one, you will have to choose between a helicopter or paying for your base upkeep.\n* Missions from the survivor mission mod. Compete with other players for rewards that tie in with events and the new upkeep system!\n* Hunt for hidden treasure with the treasure mod!  Metal detector required!\n* Windstride's clothing, Cl0ud's gear, Tactical Flava, and the equipment system mod for better looking civilian and military clothing, while we have balanced all modded armour based on vanilla values, so nothing is overpowered.\n* The best looking and sounding weapons pack we could find.\n* Custom fortress area at Tisy.\n\n**Events**\n\n* Regular events, with prizes.\n\n**Seasons**\n\n* Season change every 3 weeks - Play autumn/fall, winter, spring, and summer maps.\n* Current season is Winter.\n\n**Other settings**\n\n* 7 hours for daytime and 2 hours for night.\n* Long wipe cycle, lasting at least 12 weeks.",

Contents and features discussed are subject to change before release. We aim to provide insight and foster community engagement, but details may evolve as development continues. Thank you for joining us on this journey, with the understanding that what you see here is a glimpse into the process.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWelcome to another installment of the Dev Blog, where we're providing you with an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the DayZ Frostline Expansion. Our goal is to be more transparent by showcasing our creative process, challenges, and achievements. We want to dedicate these to the DayZ community, who have shown deep commitment and interest in the inner workings of DayZ's development.\n\nThis time around, we are peeking into Skybox and Weather changes.\u00a0  \nFor next blog, we will get to look at some of the \"Points of interests\".\n\n(Watch on yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVtMjoGFrG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVtMjoGFrG8) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ty5n77wk2l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae6d3ca2387ddc98a1cc97f13cb00116d6d5f8\n\n# Sneak Pe\ufeffek\n\n**Skybox**\n\n*\"Building on our legacy with Chernarus and Livonia, our goal was to craft a unique skybox texture to enrich Sakhals atmosphere distinctively. For this endeavor, a blend of Cirrus and Alto/Cirrocumulus clouds emerged as the perfect match.*\n\n*Our vision was clea\ufeffr, shaped by extensive exploration of the Kamchatkan region through Google Street View, complemented by our own collection of winter sky photographs taken right from our office. This process enabled us to envision the ideal backdrop that truly represents the cold and world we aim to imme\ufeffrse our players in.\"*\n\n--\u00a0Florian (DOJ), Environmental Designer\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahudi4e80l6d1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d3386efd6b5bb54fa7b8803f912300884ff1ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1vj4x732l6d1.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea21d91ff6690085c03b4021a3c66c15265d9e26\n\n**Wind & Predicting the weather**\n\n*\"We now have more control over weather elements, especially wind, allowing us to create dynamic weather patterns and unexpected shifts. \ufeffWhile these patterns won't occur in a predetermined manner, we are providing more hints (for example, the direction of the snow particles) to help predict these weather changes. This increased predictability should encourage you to better prepare for the harsh snowstorms of Sakhal or the thunderstorms of Livonia.*  \n*The goal is not only to make your gameplay more immersive but also to give a strategic advantage to those who can anticipate challenges from the terrains, observe their surroundings, and respond accordingly.\"*\n\n-- \u00d6zg\u00fcr Nergis, Game Designe\ufeffr\n\nWatch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMXprfMAvk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMXprfMAvk)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5ihi8cf0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9cd46a5da9365064a3d374a3599c9c2ff7f5874\n\n**Fog & View Distance**\u00a0\n\nExpanding more on the customization of weather elements, we are also enhancing fog functionality to have more control. Currently, fog is driven by overcast and distance fog values defined by the config, which is quite limiting. With the release of Frostline, both the dev team and modders will have full dynamic control over the fog through a new script API. Check out the demonstration video below to see new fog in action.\u00a0\n\n(Watch at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2vak5mddo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2vak5mddo) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpcsu3an0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a57f4671fc85b6b667fbaa18ce8d17cf3653e87\n\nThe fog will now affect the visibility of the sky, which\u00a0presents more possibilities for those of us who enjoy a good gloomy \"Silent Hill\" vibe.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ilaid4gr0l6d1.gif\n\nFor PC we are increasing view distance. This upgrade substantially expands the ranges and you will retain full control within settings. Due to current performance and testing limitations, we are not able to extend these improvements to console platforms at this time but will consider other platforms in the future.\n\n*\"In our quest to improve view distances, the team didn\u2019t just agree\u2014they firmly belie\ufeffved it was a change whose time had come. With Sakhal, we seized the opportunity to implement this enhancement.\u00a0We\u2019re excited for you to experience this across all maps, and we anticipate it will benefit the modding community.\"*\n\n-- Ale\u0161 Stupka, Programme\ufeffr\n\n(Video at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTrQMdJli0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTrQMdJli0) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9b9gdqsz0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ac42ce0aeed1e968d920775bf5263ffc741ca60",

            "I wish they would do these permanently (not just for Frostline), because in addition to creating a better connection between the community and developers, it gives everyone an inside look into the thought process, design decisions, etc. Likewise, on top of them doing a complete revamp of their horrible website, it would be nice to see them do some sort of fan engagement in a monthly or bi-monthly Q&A on here with an AMA (or on the other platforms).",

            "Yeah it's great, but also annoying that they didn't do it earlier. The game has supported at least 10km view distances for about 6 years, but BI simply hasn't bothered to put it back in the video options before. Well it is in the options, but hidden in the overall quality presets setting and limited to something like 3km currently."
