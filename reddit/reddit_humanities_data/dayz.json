Contents and features discussed are subject to change before release. We aim to provide insight and foster community engagement, but details may evolve as development continues. Thank you for joining us on this journey, with the understanding that what you see here is a glimpse into the process.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWelcome to another installment of the Dev Blog, where we're providing you with an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the DayZ Frostline Expansion. Our goal is to be more transparent by showcasing our creative process, challenges, and achievements. We want to dedicate these to the DayZ community, who have shown deep commitment and interest in the inner workings of DayZ's development.\n\nThis time around, we are peeking into Skybox and Weather changes.\u00a0  \nFor next blog, we will get to look at some of the \"Points of interests\".\n\n(Watch on yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVtMjoGFrG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVtMjoGFrG8) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ty5n77wk2l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae6d3ca2387ddc98a1cc97f13cb00116d6d5f8\n\n# Sneak Pe\ufeffek\n\n**Skybox**\n\n*\"Building on our legacy with Chernarus and Livonia, our goal was to craft a unique skybox texture to enrich Sakhals atmosphere distinctively. For this endeavor, a blend of Cirrus and Alto/Cirrocumulus clouds emerged as the perfect match.*\n\n*Our vision was clea\ufeffr, shaped by extensive exploration of the Kamchatkan region through Google Street View, complemented by our own collection of winter sky photographs taken right from our office. This process enabled us to envision the ideal backdrop that truly represents the cold and world we aim to imme\ufeffrse our players in.\"*\n\n--\u00a0Florian (DOJ), Environmental Designer\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahudi4e80l6d1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d3386efd6b5bb54fa7b8803f912300884ff1ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1vj4x732l6d1.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea21d91ff6690085c03b4021a3c66c15265d9e26\n\n**Wind & Predicting the weather**\n\n*\"We now have more control over weather elements, especially wind, allowing us to create dynamic weather patterns and unexpected shifts. \ufeffWhile these patterns won't occur in a predetermined manner, we are providing more hints (for example, the direction of the snow particles) to help predict these weather changes. This increased predictability should encourage you to better prepare for the harsh snowstorms of Sakhal or the thunderstorms of Livonia.*  \n*The goal is not only to make your gameplay more immersive but also to give a strategic advantage to those who can anticipate challenges from the terrains, observe their surroundings, and respond accordingly.\"*\n\n-- \u00d6zg\u00fcr Nergis, Game Designe\ufeffr\n\nWatch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMXprfMAvk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMXprfMAvk)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5ihi8cf0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9cd46a5da9365064a3d374a3599c9c2ff7f5874\n\n**Fog & View Distance**\u00a0\n\nExpanding more on the customization of weather elements, we are also enhancing fog functionality to have more control. Currently, fog is driven by overcast and distance fog values defined by the config, which is quite limiting. With the release of Frostline, both the dev team and modders will have full dynamic control over the fog through a new script API. Check out the demonstration video below to see new fog in action.\u00a0\n\n(Watch at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2vak5mddo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2vak5mddo) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpcsu3an0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a57f4671fc85b6b667fbaa18ce8d17cf3653e87\n\nThe fog will now affect the visibility of the sky, which\u00a0presents more possibilities for those of us who enjoy a good gloomy \"Silent Hill\" vibe.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ilaid4gr0l6d1.gif\n\nFor PC we are increasing view distance. This upgrade substantially expands the ranges and you will retain full control within settings. Due to current performance and testing limitations, we are not able to extend these improvements to console platforms at this time but will consider other platforms in the future.\n\n*\"In our quest to improve view distances, the team didn\u2019t just agree\u2014they firmly belie\ufeffved it was a change whose time had come. With Sakhal, we seized the opportunity to implement this enhancement.\u00a0We\u2019re excited for you to experience this across all maps, and we anticipate it will benefit the modding community.\"*\n\n-- Ale\u0161 Stupka, Programme\ufeffr\n\n(Video at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTrQMdJli0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTrQMdJli0) )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9b9gdqsz0l6d1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ac42ce0aeed1e968d920775bf5263ffc741ca60",

            "These are some of the core tech features a lot of us have been hoping for a long time and I\u2019m here for it! This expansion is looking promising. \n\nWhile 1.25 has caused some strife, I think in time we\u2019re in for a great experience.",
            "view distance change is big for me, feels so short and its very jarring compared to arma 3 where I have it on max all the time.",
            "Look at that.\n\nNever a game 10 years old looked so good",
            "I wish they would do these permanently (not just for Frostline), because in addition to creating a better connection between the community and developers, it gives everyone an inside look into the thought process, design decisions, etc. Likewise, on top of them doing a complete revamp of their horrible website, it would be nice to see them do some sort of fan engagement in a monthly or bi-monthly Q&A on here with an AMA (or on the other platforms).",
            "looks cool snow is a fun map",
            "Yeah all the info that there coming out has me abit giddy, it\u2019s not just new items and stuff but more meta background stuff that has the chance to impact the game in new and huge ways. Exciting times. \n\nJust a shame they dropped a controversial patch and said there won\u2019t be another for nearly a year lol.",
            "Just getting back into the game. Can someone give me a tldr of everyone's gripes with the new update? I notice zombies have directional microphones to find you from 2 blocks away now, besides that",
            "Yeah it's great, but also annoying that they didn't do it earlier. The game has supported at least 10km view distances for about 6 years, but BI simply hasn't bothered to put it back in the video options before. Well it is in the options, but hidden in the overall quality presets setting and limited to something like 3km currently."
