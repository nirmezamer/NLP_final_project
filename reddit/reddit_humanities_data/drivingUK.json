            "Forgot to add this to the video, but rule 134 of The Highway Code states:  \nYou should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane as directed. In congested road conditions do not change lanes unnecessarily. Merging in turn is recommended but only if safe and appropriate when vehicles are travelling at a very low speed, e.g. when approaching road works or a road traffic incident. It is not recommended at high speed.  \nSee it for yourself: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/general-rules-techniques-and-advice-for-all-drivers-and-riders-103-to-158"

            "This is a problem with wide cycle paths, for as much as I appreciate them as a cyclist, they do end up being open for abuse with some people seeing them as an extra lane to drive in. I would say providing a protected barrier stops this, but the cycle path is literally on the other side of a grass verge on a slop so very much protected. The only thing that could change would be to add a fence or bollards.",
            "A little context, not super clear in the video. The lane we were in turns right at the lights. At the end of the cycle lane theres a bus stop with a yellow box so traffic doesn't block it. \nHe mounts the grass to get onto the cycle lane, drives all the way to the end, exits the cycle path via the bus stop and turns right up the road.\nHe doesn't stop to do maintenance which is what I assumed he was going to do, just did it to avoid the traffic light.",
