            "Forgot to add this to the video, but rule 134 of The Highway Code states:  \nYou should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane as directed. In congested road conditions do not change lanes unnecessarily. Merging in turn is recommended but only if safe and appropriate when vehicles are travelling at a very low speed, e.g. when approaching road works or a road traffic incident. It is not recommended at high speed.  \nSee it for yourself: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/general-rules-techniques-and-advice-for-all-drivers-and-riders-103-to-158"

            "I've seen this guys videos a few days ago. He has very little control over the vehicle considering the speeds that he's driving. In fact, he's actually got less control over the vehicles now than he did after he got some constructive criticism of his driving. It appears that he has his seat even further back now which means he can't hold the steering wheel properly. It's why his hands are almost always below 9 and 3 and why he's almost always driving with his finger tips. It's incredible that he hasn't killed anyone yet in the over 450 daily videos he has uploaded. Especially considering there's a few videos where he's driving in excess of 80mph though residential areas.\n\nI have tracked him down to being in the Oldham area and know his name. I reported him to the Greater Manchester police linking the youtube, his personal Instagram, Linkdin account and also his post code the response I got was:\n\n>The matter has now been reviewed by a Roads Policing Officer who has determined the appropriate action.\n\n>No further action was taken in relation to this matter. There is a clear offence from the footage provided and usually this would be sent to the Central Ticket Office for prosecution or awareness course. However unfortunately despite several reviews we are unable to obtain a clear VRM which means we are unable to progress this further.\n\nUsually when reporting driving offenses to the police, I wouldn't have any issues with them not pursuing bad driving, but this guy has daily videos of him driving like an utter cunt on the wrong side of the road around blind country corners. I hope that when (not if) he does crash, it's just himself into a tree. The police really need to open an actual investigation on this before he does kill someone. I would say before he kills himself, but it appears that he doesn't care about that, otherwise he wouldn't be driving like that on open public roads.",

I generally keep left unless overtaking, or when moving over to the middle makes it easier for merging cars when it\u2019s busy, after which I move back over to the left. \n\nI had a question regarding approaching junctions where the middle and right hand lanes stay on the current motorway, and the left is to join another (for example at junction 16 on the m25). How far back from the junction is it acceptable to stay in the second lane if I wanted to continue straight on the m25? Should I wait for the small dashed lines to move over or is it better to be in lane 2 a couple miles in advance? I don\u2019t want to be in the middle lane for longer than necessary at the risk of being a middle lane hogger. I\u2019ve added pictures for reference to the type of junction i\u2019m asking about. \n\nThanks in advance! \n\n\n",

When you see the lane markings shorten (pic 2), that's when you're supposed to be in the lane to turn off so I'll say the *latest* you should move over is when you see the change in markings.  But don't move over when there's an unbroken line.",

If you regularly travel down that road and know that queues form on that lane.
