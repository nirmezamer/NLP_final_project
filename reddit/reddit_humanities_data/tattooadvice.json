            "Question: a lot of times people ask for social media tags because they like the art and want to look into getting a piece from them. Im assuming that is also discouraged and considered doxxing..? Or no, because doxxing is only when its done with shit tattoos and malice? Genuinely unsure",
            "Yeah I've seen a few comments saying we should publicly dox bad artists. Feels weird",
            "how is dropping PUBLIC social media doxxing... you can just say no exposing or name dropping doxxing is way more severe than this",
            "So is gamertag dropping also illegal ?",
            "Yeah I really feel this should be context dependent.",
            "Yeah, I'm with you on that.",
            "Generally doxxing is considered sharing names and contact info that the person doesn't intend for the public to have access to. A public Instagram page with their work and studio name wouldn't count as doxxing, but saying something like \"oh this tattoo artist's real name is Jane Smith and she lives at 123 Main Street/ has another job at the Starbucks on Grand Ave.\" would absolutely be doxxing.",
            "Legally that is very much a grey zone while yes the intention is not malicious. It can still be consider doxxing legally as you don't know the intention of other people who now have access to this information. The answer of your question honestly would probably come down to the ruling of a judge. I'm making this to err on the side of caution So that the sub does not get taken down or finding itself in any legal issues",

            "It is HARD to get micro realism done well. Find an artist who has a proven track record of doing it well and then pay the price for it. This will be really easy for someone to get wrong, and if they even mention lining it then they aren't going to do it right",
            "Any small fine line tattoo like this runs the risk of blurring or fading as it ages. If youre fine with that then go for it. Its a beautiful tattoo and it sounds like it means something to you and thats really all that matters. I have a few fine line tattoos myself that I religiously apply sunscreen too and they still look great 5+ years later.",
            "Very very few artists in the WORLD can achieve microrealism like this.  Even still, they don't always age well.  I'd recommend letting go of this style and going bigger.",
            "Do small it will likely age to look like a brown smudge. Talk to a real tattoo artist on the feasibility of this",

            "The design is cute but you should definitely get it larger than the reference photo. This size will blur like crazy and itll be all one shade of beige in a few years.",

            "Too small. Will blur over time",
            "It looks super good now, and will for a bit, but sadly overtime that will not look good. The smaller the tattoo the worse it will look, especially since theres no lines or black , gotta have that contrast to make it sit in skin"

            "Looks like I cannot edit my post the tattoo is Italian, it is called the cornicello which represents good luck (chilli/horn) & the hand gesture is supposed to get rid of evil spirits. It was a 30th birthday gift from my brother. He paid for it as you cannot give good luck to yourself, must be gifted.",
            "I don't dislike it at all, if follows the line of your muscles quite well so the \"sticker effect\" is minimized. Give it time, it might grow on you. You might wanna try adding to the little chain, so it swirls around and it is more clear that they're lucky charms",
            "i love it, and as an italian i immediately understood what it was",
            "Yeah, I dont know man, I like it. Placement is killer. I had absolutely no idea what the chili/horn was but not in a bad way, hearing the story is awesome and it explains the tattoo perfectly.",

            "Came here to say I like it- especially the shading & weight of the lines. Others are correct in advising give it time! 2 things I could suggest- some color (red is the obvious choice for me at least) and secondly, add more tattoos :)",
            "Coming from another Italian, it was immediately recognizable. I had to go back and read your text to figure out why it was a \"regret.\" Maybe in the future you could get the pepper colored in?",

My Artist kinda laughed at me and was like lets just concentrate on getting the wrist to elbow done first, and then see how youre feeling Ill tell you what, by the time he got to my elbow(about 4 1/2 hours) I was like Ya lets just book another day for the top part of my arm. And I have to admit, Im glad I did, because this healing process is the hardest Ive ever done, and I have probably 50% of my body covered in ink. 4 days in and it still throbs whenever its below my heart(especially bad if I reach down for something), and it feels like I have my arm is wrapped in some SUPER tight bandages or something. DAMN does it look good tho!! Just hitting the peeling stage today, and Im stoked to see it when its done!!",

But regardless of that the difference in the pain from my upper body was phenomenal. I didn't tap but there were a few moments which I was on the verge of caving. Not sure why it was so different but yeah it got to me",
