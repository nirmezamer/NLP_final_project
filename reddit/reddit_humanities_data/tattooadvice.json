I\u2019m assuming that is also discouraged and considered doxxing..? Or no, because doxxing is only when it\u2019s done with shit tattoos and malice? Genuinely unsure",

            "She and anyone else are perfectly allowed to make posts like that and ask for help in her situation. In fact, I encourage it. I do not want her to get into any kind of possible trouble or the sub because A few people who got this link decided to harass them which the person could then sue for. And because of how the legality If they are sued The judge can only focus on whether whether they actually doxxed this person or not. It does suck That the legal system doesn't take into account reasoning for this kind of situation. There are local resources in most places that allow somebody to get help. I have had to use these myself. The last thing she needs is to be sued by the dude. And judges can be very unpredictable with these kinds of cases as they are not used to them and many don't really understand what doxxing is. \n\nI make this post since I have been doxxed so I have talked to a lawyer about it. In my situation the authorities didn't do much after they found out the person was using a burner account. However finding who owns a reddit account like that is much easier."
