        "num_comments": 12,
        "comments": [
            "Turning up the vert sense multiplier is a bad move if you're trying to improve. It feels good at first- not having to pull down as much, but your muscle memory for snapping onto targets with DMRs and snipers will suffer. Spend more time in training mode emptying mags into the target in the underground target range (the one that has a monitor to track your hits). If you're in a clan, use the clan training mode because you have a longer time limit. I would spend an hour easily in there dumping a thousand rounds while trying out different settings and different attachments.\n\nDon't be shy. Training mode isn't just for people that have never played before.",
            "turning up sensitivity in one direction can make your muscle memory like useless and make the game feel wonky\n\nit's easier to just pull the mouse down at your regular sensitivity",
            "Doubling your vert sens doesn't make it easier, you just move your mouse less. You still have to be precise and have control over your movement to hit a good spray.",
            "It actually isn't really meta anymore.  Most people use half-grip now as far as I know.",
            "Stop spreading misinformation. In early access everyone was locked to 0.75 as there wasn't an option to change it. Most asian pros didn't switch to 1 and are snapping with DMR just fine. Most of the best players in the world don't use 1 vertical. It's personal preference and PUBG isn't even a flicking game. There's so much more to shooting than adjust your sens for the perfect flicks. I agree that there is a certain point where vertical multiplier could be too big and counterproductive.",
            "I too use the half grip on all ARs except AUG. For some reason, I control the recoil better with the vert on AUG.",
            "This isn't true.\n\nThe half grip is definitely the second most popular and has enough going for it to make it a competitor to the vert on certain guns, but vert is still absolutely the meta and what the vast majority of comp players still run",
            "some people are used to it. half grip is my go to on every AR. after that it depends - usually my order is: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nberyl: half, vert, thumb, light, angled\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nace: half, vert, angled, thumb, light\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0m4 and SCAR:\u00a0half, thumb, light, angled, vert\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0aug: half, vert, angled, thumb, light\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nthe lightweight can help get crazy tight sprays on the m4 if you learn to pull a little more at the beginning of the spray. it\u2019s really good for hitting tight consistent headshots but it\u2019s less good for spraying cars and shit - i still use the vert as a secondary on the higher recoil ars",
            "Everyone replying about muscle memory is wrong, that is not how muscle memory works in regards to aiming. You can keep other people's replies in mind, but you should always do your own research.\n\n\nThe vert has the tightest grouping for the first 10 shots, and most good players can get a kill in the first 10 shots. It also retains the best grouping for scope sprays. \n\n\nAnother common theme is quoting wackyjacky mag dumps against a wall and how the angled is better. It is better.. but literally only for mag dumps, vert wins everywhere else.",
            "Disregard all of the bullshit you just read in thread. It has nothing to do with \"making muscle memory useless\". The reason is it doesn't help in the way you think it will help. In certain ranges and with certain weapons it feels better to have a faster vertical but it can also significantly degrade other engagements depending on how high you make it. Anything over 1.2-1.3 is overkill. Moving your mouse less doesn't mean it makes it easier at all ranges. It means you have less control of where you are shooting but it requires less effort so if the target is really big then it could be a benefit. But when the target is far away and small it could make hitting your shots much harder.\n\nIt's the same principle of using a faster mouse to \"make recoil less so that you don't need attachments\". Yes, you'd have an easier time spraying 40 bullets with 4x beryl and 0 attachments than someone with a slower mouse but it'd be way harder for you to be consistent because your mouse is faster and thus there is smaller margin for error and it's harder to keep hitting the same spot at range. So the slower sens person can just spray 10-15 bullets with higher precision much more easily which is also the typical usage of guns and that's why you see pros generally running slower sens.\n\nVertical is meta because it's the best grip for the use case of ARs in the game. You'd notice that pros aren't standing in the middle of nowhere and spraying 40 bullets. They do short peeks and fire a few bullets. The horizontal recoil in the first few bullets is very minimal and the lesser kick with the vertical makes you more likely to double headshot. That's why lightweight is the ultimate grip if you never miss your first few bullets. However if you are ever shooting more than 5 bullets then it gets outclassed by other grips. Vertical does bursts very well while also doing sprays very well in cases you have multiple enemies or the person is far or it's a vehicle and you indeed spray the whole 40 bullets."
