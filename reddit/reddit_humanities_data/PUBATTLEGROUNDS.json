            "Turning up the vert sense multiplier is a bad move if you're trying to improve. It feels good at first- not having to pull down as much, but your muscle memory for snapping onto targets with DMRs and snipers will suffer. Spend more time in training mode emptying mags into the target in the underground target range (the one that has a monitor to track your hits). If you're in a clan, use the clan training mode because you have a longer time limit. I would spend an hour easily in there dumping a thousand rounds while trying out different settings and different attachments.\n\nDon't be shy. Training mode isn't just for people that have never played before.",
            "Doubling your vert sens doesn't make it easier, you just move your mouse less. You still have to be precise and have control over your movement to hit a good spray.",
            "turning up sensitivity in one direction can make your muscle memory like useless and make the game feel wonky\n\nit's easier to just pull the mouse down at your regular sensitivity",
            "some people are used to it. half grip is my go to on every AR. after that it depends - usually my order is: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nberyl: half, vert, thumb, light, angled\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nace: half, vert, angled, thumb, light\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0m4 and SCAR:\u00a0half, thumb, light, angled, vert\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0aug: half, vert, angled, thumb, light\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nthe lightweight can help get crazy tight sprays on the m4 if you learn to pull a little more at the beginning of the spray. it\u2019s really good for hitting tight consistent headshots but it\u2019s less good for spraying cars and shit - i still use the vert as a secondary on the higher recoil ars",
            "It actually isn't really meta anymore.  Most people use half-grip now as far as I know.",
            "It just provides a solid vert reduction, is consistent, and is nice when you dont have a front attachment.\n\nSince they buffed the grips, if you have a comp, most grips are fine.\n\nPractice without a front attachment or grip, and most become a preference of what you practice with.\n\nIm still a vert grip user and probably will be until they ruin it.",
            "I too use the half grip on all ARs except AUG. For some reason, I control the recoil better with the vert on AUG.",
            "This isn't true.\n\nThe half grip is definitely the second most popular and has enough going for it to make it a competitor to the vert on certain guns, but vert is still absolutely the meta and what the vast majority of comp players still run"
