            "Does anyone know for certain why the jury residence is called \"Ponderosa\"?  Yes, I know about the ranch from *Bonanza*, but if that is in fact the origin of the name, how did it come to be applied to the jury residence?",

            "Was JT considered for Winners at War? Or was there a reason he wasn\u2019t there? I just rewatched Tocantins and am now starting to watch WAW for the first time. \n\nAnd when I search the sub, obviously lots of stuff comes up for JT so I thought I see if this was a faster/easier way to get my answer :)",
            "we know that season 50 is going to have returning players, but do we know the extent? is it some newbies and some returning, all returning? winners involved or just non-winners? old school and new school? any shot the fans will get to vote people in? TIA :)",
            "At the F4 in Season 45 - Dee insists that Katurah is a jury threat. Was this accurate? I feel like a Dee/Jake/Katurah endgame is a slam dunk for Dee as the season's dominant player, no? It's a bit like Tony/Natalie/Michele.",
            "What do you guys think is the likelihood of Edge returning for season 50? Too much for the budget or?",

I put in that he was a \"several-day\" champion after he won his 7th game and it seems like a lot of people really liked that. So, I spent part of the day today figuring out how to keep that part in there after his next game. As it turns out, I don't have to worry about it anymore, as Drew unfortunately lost today, but that means he will forever be: a several-day Jeopardy champion lol. Long live Jelinsky!!!",

            "He wasn't kidding when he said he's one of the smartest Survivors ever. Winning 7 games of Jeopardy should cement that idea. Drew was winning by so much in some of the games that he didn't need to wager anything in Final Jeopardy because no matter what the others did it wouldn't be enough, but he did it anyway lol.",

I don't think Rob or Russell even mention or speak to each other.\n\n- Redemption Island: Get's dominated in the pre-merge by one player, Matt, who wins himself back in only to get sent back immediately then stays on redemption until the finale only to then unceremoniously lose the final dual to Andrea, who was the last person sent to redemption, who then immediately gets voted out again too. \n\n- Post-Merge: Is a slow pagonging of all the Zapeteras, there is no shake up in the tribe and the boot order is obvious\n\n- Final Tribal: Has an uncompetitive FTC with one clear standout players and two goats making the ending predictable once Rob won final immunity\n\nThere is no way Jeff would have been that high on the season if it was the exact same except Rob lost final immunity and was booted at the Final 4.\n\nSide Note: Rob and Russell having to promote that season together in TV interviews before the airing is extremely funny since Russell knows he got absolutely destroyed and Rob knew damn well he won.",

It\u2019s so funny to think back to when the season aired because I remember so many fans pulling so hard for Matt to come back and win it all.",
