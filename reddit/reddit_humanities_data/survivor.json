            "What would the protocol be for a 'circular vote'?\n\nA votes for B votes for C votes for D votes for E votes for A resulting in a 1-1-1-1-1 vote.\n\nNo individual immunity, no hidden idols in play, no SITD played, etc.\n\nThe normal tiebreak rules don't hold up.  Normally everyone in the tie doesn't re-vote, but that means 0 people would be in the re-vote.\n\nMaybe everyone votes again?  Or it's considered an immediate deadlock and the whole tribe goes to rocks?",
            "Does anyone know for certain why the jury residence is called \"Ponderosa\"?  Yes, I know about the ranch from *Bonanza*, but if that is in fact the origin of the name, how did it come to be applied to the jury residence?",
            "in the old days when they did endurance challenges, did they get to reapply sunscreen at any point? i'm thinking of the ones on poles out in the water especially, or the \"hand on the idol\" type one like in africa.. because no one ever seems hideously sunburned at tribal/the next day. i know they give it to them at camp but they have to had given it to them to reapply right? or maybe crew very delicately applied it (lol)?",
            "At what point and why did the challenges pivot from being combative to endurance-focused? \n\nWatching some of the earlier seasons, I was surprised at how many challenges were based on physically fighting one another. It felt a lot more 'Lord of the Flies' and lacked that community I love about the show. \n\nAt some point, challenges have become more about endurance, smarts, team work, and overall fitness and strength. When did this happen and was there a specific incident that caused this change?",
            "Survivor is a very different game depending on your cast mates awareness of your threat level. \n\nThreat level management has shown to be a crucial piece of the puzzle for finding your way into the final tribal council.\n\nMy question is:\n\nIf you were on survivor, your cover is blown, and your tribe mates are all looking to vote you out, what maneuvers are you using to try and survive another tribal council?",

I just rewatched Tocantins and am now starting to watch WAW for the first time. \n\nAnd when I search the sub, obviously lots of stuff comes up for JT so I thought I see if this was a faster/easier way to get my answer :)"

I put in that he was a \"several-day\" champion after he won his 7th game and it seems like a lot of people really liked that. So, I spent part of the day today figuring out how to keep that part in there after his next game. As it turns out, I don't have to worry about it anymore, as Drew unfortunately lost today, but that means he will forever be: a several-day Jeopardy champion lol. Long live Jelinsky!!!",

        "content": "James was rude to people in China and in Micronesia. I think the only reason why he was on the hero tribe was because he was hot. That\u2019s it. His social game is terrible. He barks at people all the time. The way he bullied Stephanie was brutal. Am I wrong? ",

        "comments": [
            "He was one of the most popular characters ever. That\u2019s why. The labels pretty arbitrary, and one can make the case that a lot of the heroes are villains and vice versa.",
            "I think the producers did OK with what tribe they put James in.\n\nIt just so happened that starting with HvV, James started acting like a massive dick.\n\nMaking fun of Eliza for \"complaining\" after she took a hit to the dome and was displaying fairly obvious symptoms of a concussion was not very *heroic.*",
            "There were a few questionable casting choices on HvV (Sugar being a hero is always wild to me) but I think a lot of it came down to a mix of the audience opinion on the players and the archetype they'd filled - James was generally beloved at the time (his hotness definitely played a factor) but he was also portrayed as the \"good guy trying to do an honest day's work\", especially during his China edit. This era was heavily defined by the two camps of \"form an alliance and play an honest game with them\" and \"backstab and blindside your way to the final tribal\" and James' game play generally fit into the former",
            "He was a two time fan favorite award winner. That man was a lock for the Heroes tribe.",
            "Because he never lied or backstabbed people and just wanted to win. But I'm HvV at that challenge he really did act like a villain.",
            "He was incredibly easy to root for in both cina and Micronesia in my mind. Of course he's the villain in hvv but people loved gravedigger James in china",
            "\u201cHero\u201d was pretty much defined as \u201cSomeone who production wanted to bring back who wasn\u2019t necessarily a Villain\u201d\n\nAlso, I feel like James was a lot more pleasant in 15 and 16, or at least the edit showed he was\n\nHe would\u2019ve felt more out of place if production put him on the Villains tribe IMO\n\nJust being rude isn\u2019t really Villain material. I can\u2019t think of anyone on the Heroes tribe who never did anything on their original seasons that could be interpreted as Rude, except maybe Amanda",
            "Okay let's not forget what a complete ahole Stephenie was. The edit could be interpreted that way but IDK if that is 100% accurate. It is also said that he quit smoking the day before he got on the plane or something like that, which could also attribute to his irritability. (Not an excuse, but a reason... and one that production might not have been aware of in the casting)\n\nI think overall he was seen as a hero due to his physical strength and for how much the fans love him. He also had a very tight alliance in China and was viewed as very loyal in both China and Micronesia. Those are \"heroic\" qualities in the game. So no I don't think it was just because of his looks.\n\nHe is not the most questionable casting in HvV by far. There is a lot of questionable casting on HvV. Parvati being one of them. Candace being another. and Even Stephenie as mentioned above. It could be said after her performance in Guatemala that she could be cast on the Villains.",
            "I\u2019m rewatching Micronesia currently, and this seems like selective memory. Think about the way he handles Kathy. He\u2019s kind, supportive, and doesn\u2019t judge her for her quit. In fact, I\u2019d say the only moment in Micronesia where he seems not heroic is when he\u2019s getting testy with Eliza, saying that they should have voted her out. But even then, he said it directly to her face, not behind her back.\n\nI don\u2019t remember China quite as well, but I don\u2019t remember him being all that difficult or mean in that season. HvV, yeah, he was crabby and not super nice, but if you judge him by his seasons before then, I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty clear why he\u2019s a hero.",
            "The real question is how was *Stephenie* a hero. James was loved by his castmates on both China & Micro, the same can\u2019t be said for Stephenie on Palau and Guatemala."
