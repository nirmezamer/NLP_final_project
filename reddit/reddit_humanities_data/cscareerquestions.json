        "content": "I am writing this for the people who are feeling discouraged about the job market as I know I felt. I am a new grad with a B.S. in Software Engineering who was lucky enough to be able to find a job after only a month of searching.\n\nHow did I do this?\n\n1. I searched for jobs **locally**. I feel like people get stuck looking for exclusively remote jobs. I applied to remote jobs too, but with very little success. The ones that responded the most were the ones that I found locally. I live an hour from a major city in the northeast, so I made sure to look for companies near and around the city as well as near me.\n2. I searched for jobs **directly on company websites**. Oftentimes, I found that companies near me - especially smaller ones - did not post their jobs on major websites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor. I highly recommend searching company websites in your area. I googled \u201ctech companies near me\u201d, \u201clargest employers near me\u201d, \u201chealthcare companies near me\u201d, etc., went down lists of companies and and went to their company website.\n3. I submitted a **cover letter for every application**. I used the same cover letter template for nearly all the jobs I applied to and changed a few sentences based on the company's mission statement/position. \n4. I searched for **new job postings daily**. On LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Otta, Google jobs, and the company websites of companies that I was most interested in around my area I searched for the keywords \"new grad, associate, junior, intern, internship, entry-level\". Be careful of scams! \n5. I included **keywords** from job postings in my **resume**. I made sure to only include keywords of areas that I could show that I had experience in and bolded them. I also made sure to add them to my LinkedIn skills.\n6. I searched for jobs in tech **outside of my area of expertise**. Instead of applying to just \"software engineer, developer, full-stack, front-end, back-end\" positions I also searched for positions adjacent to software but still in tech. \"Data analyst, Business analyst, IT, Programmer Analyst, Computer Engineer, etc.\" Beggars can\u2019t be choosers!\n7. I **cold-called** companies and recruiters in my area. If there was a company I was particularly interested in I would ask to connect on LinkedIn with a note saying \"Hi there \\[name\\], I am extremely interested in working at \\[company\\]. It would be great to connect for a 10-minute chat to see if I might be a good fit. I am looking for a role in \\[tech area\\]. Please let me know if there is someone else on your team I should reach out to instead!\"\n8. I **connected with recruiters** from companies that I **already applied to**. I went on LinkedIn, searched the company, went to the company page, went to \u201cpeople\u201d and searched the keywords \u201crecruiter, recruiting, talent, acquisition, early career, career, people\u201d. Then I changed the location to my area. If I found someone, I sent a connection request with a note stating that I applied to a role and was looking to learn more about the company/role. If no recruiters were in my area, I would message a recruiter from a relatively close area and ask if they could connect me to someone in my area.\n\nOverall, I applied to 93 jobs over 1 month and had 17 rejections. I tried to apply to 5-10 a day, some days with less success than others but I made sure to keep track in an Excel document. This past week I had 3 successful interviews with two offers and landed a remote Data Analyst job at 70k. I realize I am very lucky, but I hope this might help someone else or encourage them to keep going! Don't give up.\n\nEdit: Since people have asked, \nhere is an anonymized version of my cover letter: https://online.publuu.com/567008/1273562\n\nEdit: And here is an anonymized version of my resume: \n                https://online.publuu.com/567008/1273679\n\nEdit: Added to #8 and #2\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the positive comments and awards! I\u2019m glad I could help some people on their journey. \n\nEdit: To the people that are saying to #6 \u201c*THiS iS BAd AdVICe FOr pEoPLe wHO WAnT a SWE JoB*\u201d, I\u2019m sorry, but you are *totally* misguided. **Any experience** is better than no experience. You can always leverage skills from similar jobs, personal projects, and certifications towards the job you want in the future. Getting your foot in the door when you\u2019re fresh out of college is *far more important* than waiting months and months for the \u201cright\u201d job, leaving you with large gaps in your resume - **especially** in this job market. There are *many many* jobs without the title SWE that require programming. Experience comes with time. Don\u2019t listen to people who tell you otherwise and don\u2019t listen to people who put down non-SWE jobs/careers. This is attested by my professional mentors. \ud83d\ude0a Rant over, thanks!",

            "Cold-calling is so underrated. My wife and I both got our current jobs in our respective areas of expertise by cold applying to companies not actively hiring.\n\nSomething to consider is that a need can exist in an organization for quite a while before any active recruitment occurs.

I think maybe some of those listings don\u2019t make it to the job boards or they don\u2019t go viral on the job boards atleast. Like when you just go on LinkedIn everyone sees the same stack of jobs so the first hundred jobs you see, everyone has also seen them and applied to them.",

        "content": "I interned at a medium-size tech company that seemed great at first. My coworker was nice, and my supervisor was helpful. The first month was great. People in the team praised me for my performance. I did better than expectation, which was already high due to what I said in the interview. Anyone looking from the outside would say I'll definitely get an offer.\n\n\nThe second month was rough because I had a personal problem and was burned out. My performance was OK at first (still better than average intern), until I got a big job. It was an experiment that they planned to use in their projects if it worked. I was **solely** in charge of this experiment. I know I'm great at what I do, but that's little bit too much for a new grad student. I'm still doing it because I thought internships were mainly for learning and that my team knows how rough it is. My supervisor even said \"take your time.\"\n\n\nI've been doing this experiment for a month. By the time it's finished, it's almost time for HR to evaluate me before the internship end. When the evaluation came, I got fucking slammed by EVERYONE.\n\n\nSupervisor: He didn't communicate with the team (I'm solely responsible for this? And besides senior, everyone seems to have no clue on how to do it) and I didn't expect him to take this long (You said \"take your time\" to me?). It took my team only half a day to find out it won't work (I found that limitation in one hour. It works because there's a workaround, your team is just lazy to make it work).\n\n\nCo-worker 1: You lack ambition that you were having. I also saw you browsing other things during work hours (while he was browsing Reddit during work hours, hello are you also reading this?)\n\n\nCo-worker 2: You were better than me when I were an intern. You finished work that I took 1 month within a week. Then, you \"disappeared\". I don't get it. (Of course, the experiment was harder than anything that I've heard that you got)\n\n\nHR: Seems like you have a lot of communication issue and lack of ambition that you were having. I expected more from you. This is below standard for one month.\n\n\nAlright, I'm definitely not getting a return offer. That's heartbreaking but fine. Until...\n\n\nHR: Everyone except you and the supervisor leaves the room.\n\n\nEveryone leave the room.\n\n\nHR: You won't be paid this month. I hope you understand that based on your performance, you didn't do enough work to justify payment. Do you have any objections?\n\n\nIt's clear that I won't get paid no matter what I will say, so I'm not making any objection. Then, he dismisses everyone.\n\n\nI hide my feelings, but I'm angry. No one ever defended me or even said anything good about me while I was doing such a great job until this job. The supervisor let me do whatever I wanted for the rest of the internship, which is fucking useless.\n\n\nI'm partially at fault. I might have taken it too long. I might have browsed other things during work hours. I don't communicate much. But I'm just an intern. I don't even know what's considered too long. I browsed other things for like 5-10 minutes before get back to work when I was tired. And I don't communicate because there's no reason to for this project. I've communicated with the team for every project except this one.\n\n\nIn the end of the day, I'm just another intern who will make mistakes. This is my first job in this field. Yes, they didn't pay me for that month. They also didn't pay me for the accommodations they promised either. They owe about $1,000, which is about a month's salary for a junior developer in my country.\n\n\nI don't care much about money, but I want to know if I really did something wrong. Most of what my supervisor and co-workers say was BS and only some was partially true. The HR decided not to pay me for that month is also worse punishment than getting fired. What I did was that bad?\n\n\nAnd I'm new in this field but is it normal to scold an intern like me like that? No one warned me about taking on too much work or communicating. The moment I realized they weren't okay with it was when they spoke to HR in evaluation. It was too late to fix anything. They could have just told me, and I would have fixed it. In the room, everyone said I was good, but they said anything but good about me in front of HR. I felt betrayed.\n\n\nTL;DR: Performed well initially, then struggled with a difficult solo project. At final evaluation, I received harsh criticism that I had never heard of until they said it during the evaluation (mostly BS), and was told that I wouldn't be paid for last month due to \"poor performance\".",

            "Agree with this, OP you're being petty about lots of things especially when you quoted your co-workers. Either the entire company sucks ass and everyone is a dumbass or it's you. \n\nAlso it's hard to give any opinions when your post is skewed to your favor ( you being treated unfairly etc ), just feels pointless imo I'll just say \"oh yeah you're right company is ass\" and it wouldn't help.",
            "The internship was already over for a while and it was just a few weeks before the end of the internship that they said I would not get paid. I would also quit if it was way before the end of the internship.\n\nThank you and I learned my mistake. It sucks that it came out this way, but at least I saw their true colors first. I wouldn't want to work with a company that breaks trust like that."
