        "content": "I've been applying to entry level software engineering jobs since I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science last year in May. In over a year, I have applied to over 1,100 jobs and gotten no interviews. Not a single one. I started working as an after school teacher / tutor after not being able to get a software engineering job a few months after graduating. It doesn't pay very much though, I'm on the brink of homelessness and I can't find anything better.\n\nAs dumb as it sounds I've known I wanted to be a programmer since I started coding as a kid and found that I genuinely love it. The promise from adults of getting a good programming job if I just work hard has literally been the only thing keeping me going throughout my life up until now. Lot's of schoolwork? It's okay, I'll get a good paying job where I'll just get to program all day if I work through it. Depressed? It's okay, I'll be comfortable enough to figure things out once I'm living on my own with that job if I just push through and earn it. Struggling financially? It's okay, you'll have enough money to live comfortably if you just keep working and get a software engineering job.\n\nSo I did everything with my life that I thought was right just to get a software engineering job: I did good in school and did extracurricular activities that looked good on my resume, got into a good university and into a major that I was told would lead to a high demand and high paying job, kept up my good grades consistently throughout college, worked a job that gave me industry relevant experience while still doing to school, did more resume friendly extracurricular activities, ended up doing my senior project for NASA, and all the while I coded in my free time just because I genuinely love programming.\n\nNow I'm having to skip meals just to pay rent. I thought it was something to do with my resume, but I managed to borrow $200 from someone so I could have my resume professionally redone by someone at TopResume a few months ago but my results haven't changed at all. [Here's a link to an anonymized version of my resume.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6qHEaKrj0s5jPDVFI1cvdUhE0bbjuH6/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPeople keep saying to just keep trying so I've just kept on doing that since there's literally nothing else to do, but it's not even slightly working. Something big needs to change with what I'm doing. I'm angry and depressed, I have nothing to live for anymore. What the fuck do I need to do to get a software engineering job or even just a single fucking interview?",

            "Keep the resume to one page. Get rid of the coloring and use a better template.\n\nIdk what TopResume is, but most normal resume advice from \"professional resume writers\" is not optimized for SWE roles.\n\nE.g., most 2024 SWE resumes don't have the summary section - it's a waste of space. And if they do have a summary, it's usually pretty short, instead of meandering paragraphs.\n\nIf I'm a recruiter, my hope is that you'd at a minimum be \"analytical\" and \"technically astute\", and given that you are applying for a SWE role, I would assume that you think you're \"skilled at designing, debugging, demonstrating, drawing, deploying, dreaming, drinking dynamic software\" or whatever.\n\nIt doesn't need to be specified, especially not with some alliterative line reminiscent of a Dr. Seuss novel.\n\nThis is why I hate resume services like this, because they take money from people, often when they are at a particularly vulnerable position, and generate absolutely nothing of value.\n\nRead this and follow the advice: [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/)\n\nHere are some templates you can use: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8narz/official\\_excellent\\_and\\_exemplary\\_resume\\_sharing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8narz/official_excellent_and_exemplary_resume_sharing/)\n\nUse bullet points, not paragraphs.\n\nDo not under any circumstances use the \"Experienced \\_\\_\\_\\_ with demonstrated history of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" template that every \"resume writing professional\" thinks is god's gift to mankind.\n\nIf you haven't already: start grinding Leetcode, LLD, and HLD. Getting the interview is only part of the battle: acing it is another thing entirely.\n\nYou will get through this. Trust. Fix your resume, start applying again, and something will click. All it takes is one yes.\n\nYou've made it this far, you will make it farther.\n\nI don't have time this weekend, but if you're not able to make much progress on this, I will rework your resume for you into a standard template next week if you'd like, for free.\n\nUnemployment sucks. I have 3 YOE and have only managed to get a single interview so far, after over hundreds of applications. Believe me when I tell you that I know it fucking sucks.\n\nBut keep your head up, and just keep going.\n\nAnd if you can figure out an anonymous way for me to like, order you some food or something, I'd be happy to do that so you can eat for a day or two. Main thing is I don't want to just give out my payment info to people online, so it'd have to be some way for me to get you food that would require absolutely no information sharing from my end. Not sure if that exists.",
            "Here's what I'd say about your resume as someone who reads a million of them:\n\n* Cut the generic intro paragraph. Everyone's got one, anyone who reads resumes ignores them. If you're going to have some free text, make it something that expresses a little personality.\n\n* Contrary to other advice I actually like the spacing and slight color differences. It's much easier on the eyes than most resumes I've read, although I'd want to feed it through some sort of OCR parser to see if it's pulling the text out correctly. That's a risk when you do a nicely formatted resume - most people looking at them are looking at them as parsed text in some sort of internal system or ATS.\n\n* Your resume in general feels very generic and scatter-shot, like you're trying to say you're good at everything. It's *conceivable* that robotics, compiler design, cybersecurity, and game design are all areas of expertise, but I wouldn't bet on it when I read an anonymous resume. It's natural to try to appeal to a wider range when you're desperate, but remember that your goal isn't to be *okay* to *everyone*, it's to be *exciting* to *someone*.\n\nAll that being said, this is all kinda marginal stuff, and what works with one recruiter might not work with another. I work in the startup world, where buzzwords, certifications, and \"resume language\" are anti-signals, but that wouldn't necessarily be true for someone working in a more traditional corporate environment.\n\nBut at the moment, **it sounds like you could use some advice that isn't directly about your job hunting.**\n\n-----\n\nSo, OP: breaking into engineering has always been hard, and you are unlucky enough to be trying to do it in the worst environment for engineers since the dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the millennium. 1,000 applications for a junior dev wasn't particularly unusual *before* the current market, and it is surely much worse now, so as *incredibly demoralizing* as it probably sounds this is well within the results you could see even if you did everything right and just got a little unlucky.\n\n> So I did everything with my life that I thought was right just to get a software engineering job\n\nOne of the hard things about professional life - or adult life in general - is that there is rarely a \"do X, get Y\" path laid out. And I think part of your distress is coming from having come into your job search with the idea that that was how it would work. Sometimes you do everything right and get screwed, sometimes you do everything wrong and get lucky. A job hunt is not an RPG quest where you collect 1000 Application Tokens and can choose between Boots of PTO or a Greater Chestguard of Seniority, and there's a lot of crappy luck involved you have zero control over. That's crappy game design and it's horribly unfun and it is also the reality of the situation.\n\nIt's an odd coincidence that your exact path - \"I graduated, fell flat on my face, and now I'm tutoring to make ends meet and about to be homeless\" - is word for word the *exact* situation I spent several years in in my 20s. I felt the same way you do right now. That frantic, panicky desperation is a killer. It doesn't even give you the kind of direction that panic normally does, because there's nothing you feel like you can *do* about it.\n\nAnd I can't exactly offer the most optimistic short-term outlook. I actually *did* end up homeless (in the \"had to go sleep in a friend's spare room indefinitely\" sense, although I was hours away from living in a tent). I thought I was dead.\n\nBut here's the thing, OP: the skills you've developed, the knowledge you have, the ways you've improved yourself: those things don't go away. Right now, there is only one thing standing between you and what you want. It's a big, frustrating, scary, difficult thing over which you have very imperfect control. But for all that things feel hopeless right now, **you only have to win *once*. You only need one thing to go right.** And then you'll never be looking for your first job ever again.\n\nI got my first job, as it happens, through someone I knew right here on Reddit. They sent me a DM on the very worst day of my life. At the moment my life hit its absolute nadir, at the moment I felt the most hopeless, like the most abject, worthless, pathetic failure who would never be anything but a waste of potential, that was the *exact moment* they were messaging me. And I went from \"where I am going to pitch my tent\" to running a team at that job in less than six months. Today, less than six years later, I'm the founder of my own company, one that might or might not succeed but that is a player at least worth taking seriously. Because I only had to win once. And then all the things I'd spent time building about myself could begin to pay off.\n\nAs hopeless and bleak as the future looks right now, it *can* turn around, and it can do so in completely random ways. It isn't forever, and you can get to a point in your life where you look back almost fondly at those moments, with a feeling of \"wow, I just could never have guessed it would turn out this way\". I know that's hard, if not impossible, to feel from where you are right now. But it is the truth.\n\n-----\n\nNow, in terms of concrete stuff:\n\n* My team interviews people. I don't know if I can find you a job. But if you're really good, we can vouch for that, and I bet I can get someone to talk to you. I've been wanting for a while to try to find a bunch of hidden skilled people the market is missing and write a blog post about it, so this isn't even altruism on my part. If you want to try, [give this problem a shot](https://www.otherbranch.com/practice-coding-problem), and let me know how you do on it. (Or lie, if you want. But the last thing I'd want to do to you in your current state is bring you into an interview you're unprepared for, so think of the practice as a way to avoid that outcome.)\n\n* Do you like pasta? I like pasta. I've got money to spare, and I would like to send you a hundred pounds of it. How might I go about doing that?\n\n* If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who has been in the almost exact godawful place that you are right now and come out the other side with the wisdom and experience that you earn by going through hell, let me know. I'll be happy to talk as much as you want, within reason, and to share my expertise as far as it goes.",
            "I'll be blunt, your resume sucks. \n\n1. I have 10+ YoE as a staff SE, team lead and manager (I am currently a hiring manager, BTW). Your resume is twice as long as mine.\n\n2. That paragraph at the top is hilarious but get rid of it. This sounds like what I'd expect ChatGPT to respond to the prompt \"Write a resume summary paragraph for a software engineer with as many buzzwords as possible, but with no actual content.\" FWIW, I did just that and it sounds almost exactly like what you have there...\n\n3. Areas of expertise. \"Software Engineering?\", well I guess I should hope so. But, you just graduated, you don't have any areas of expertise. I'd either get rid of this entirely, or change it to \"Areas of interest\" and be specific. Even if you're just lying and put whatever it is the company you're applying at does. If you want to keep it, at least move it down.\n\n4. Technical Proficiencies. Whatever, it's pretty much the same basic shit that's on everyone's resume. Just keep in mind that once you fix your resume and start getting interviews, if you have it on there you might end up having to show that you actually have proficiency in it. \n\n5. Career experience. Now we're getting somewhere. The first one (Coding and STEM Coach) is actually fine. The second one (Optimization Engineer) sounds like bullshit. Was this an actual job or an undergrad research project? I doubt this was an actual job title. Again there's a lot of words here that say virtually nothing about what you did. \"Utilized deep\nknowledge of algorithms to review individual codes and understand component-wise functionality\"... come on. That's just saying you looked at the code. And don't ever call it \"codes.\" That bullet point at the end is a good one but probably should just be a sentence in the paragraph after getting rid of all the bullshit. Here's what I'd put:\n\n>Performed extensive research on experimental grammar-based fuzzing tool.  Reduced tools\u2019 runtime by 10%-40% by eliminating irrelevant code and replacing O(N2) algorithm with O(N) algorithm. Prepared reports on research and test results.\n\nAlso don't put 2022-2022. If it's less than a couple years put the months on it. This is just basic resume protocol, I can't believe someone charging $200 would do that. \n\n5. Education section is fine. If that thing above is an undergrad research project you might want to put it here instead or in Projects.\n\n6. Projects. Some of these sound like they might be interesting if there was any information here about what you actually did. \nAnd... \"Joined voice channels at flexible times and play random sound files uploadable to the bot.\" Again I can't believe someone would charge $200 for a resume and not maintain verb tense within a single sentence. \n\n7. Certs/awards: This is fine.\n\nThen there's the order of how this stuff should appear. Get rid of the summary paragraph and Areas of Expertise. Then Career Experience, Projects, Technical Proficiencies, Awards, Certifications, Education. \n\nAnd no more than one page. \n\nBest of luck.\n\nedit: I've thought about it a bit more, and aside from all these nits, the overarching problem is that when I read the resume, I get the impression that you're trying to bullshit me. Job #1 for a hiring manager is to be able to detect that - it's the worst possible thing you can do.",

I'm not afraid to give a number, but I want to be the one saying no for salary reasons, not them.

I have to use drop a handful times a year.",
            "I have the same problem and I have problems with mobile screens but large screens don't cause any issue. Also try taking breaks in between that helps a lot.",
            "I have dry eyes from eye surgery. A lot of people suggested blue light glasses, but I find that sunglasses work better. And avoid screentime outside of work. Also using eye drops regularly\u00a0"
