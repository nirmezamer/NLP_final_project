And if you decide that what you have to ask requires a separate post then you should know that we will be actively moderating and critically assessing the quality of those posts to lessen the amount of reposts and low-effort content on this subreddit.\n\n**If you're here to help out by answering questions we thank you** \ud83e\udee1  **Just please make sure to sort the post by 'New' (if it isn\u2019t already) so you can see the newer, unanswered questions.**\n\n\n\nP.S. This megathread has been added to the sidebar.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The r/Helldivers Mod Team",

You all have by far been the best player base that I have ever seen, Not only giving positive feedback, new suggestions and input but also not pulling any punches when it came to calling out poor behaviour, additions, management, and so on and so forth while also remaining reasonable and respectful and fair towards those it was directed against.\n\nOf course I have to acknowledge how receptive, transparent, accountable and professional Arrowhead has been with the Helldiver Community and Game. Aswell acknowledge the incredible work they managed to accomplish given the overwhelming growth and popularity the game achieved in such a short time especially when you take into account the size and budget of Arrowhead as a studio at the beginning and still to this day. They have shown how much they love a care about the game and it's Community and I want them to know that has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated.\n\nI have now logged over 750 hours playing Helldivers 2 and I can confidently say I still am not remotely tired or feeling burnt out and enjoy each mission as much as my next. \n\nSo my fellow Helldivers with 750 hours surpassed all I have left to say now is Glory to Super Earth! Praise Liberty! And for the love of Freedom let's spread some Managed Democracy!\n\nI'll update again when I hit 1000 hours, until then, Spill Oil, Squash Bugs",
