            "every one of those 90 degree cuts is where the stresses of the countertop will focus and crack, and it IS going to crack as a direct result of this.   every one of those cuts should have been a radius to spread the torsional stress along a edge without a focal point.  he needs to cut the hole ever so slightly bigger and radius the corners and put in a larger sink.\n\nSource: I used to make countertops/cabinetry for a living.   He should have used a hole saw in the desired radius in each corner then cut between the holes close to the edge as possible and smoothed it out."

        "content": "I\u2019m happy to give advice I learned along the way, hopefully it helps someone.\nI spent a lot of time researching online and as usual you just piece together info. It doesn\u2019t all apply and often advice from another country doesn\u2019t apply to you as the terms are all very different (in in Australia).\nThe first 3 photos are the finished product. The rest are the process.\nI paved on top of concrete path outside our front door. It had several coats of paint that was starting to peel, so we had to do something!\nFirst I used a pressure washer to remove paint, then scrubbed it and swept/vacuumed all the small pieces of paint.\nI used \u2018Rio Gold\u2019 natural stone, apparently quartzite which is beautiful to work with. \nI first laid it out like a puzzle, which was easier but more time consuming than I thought. If you enjoy projects like puzzles, drawing or colouring in, you will enjoy this part!\nThen I made a mortar (1 part cement to 4 parts sand) and placed the stone. I had a thick 20mm layer of mortar as the natural stone isn\u2019t consistent thickness.\nAfter I finished it all, there was a bit on the surface stone. I wiped it off with a wet sponge. Later when it was fully set realised I missed a few bits so I bought some tile concrete remover spray; this worked well, but was extra work I made for myself by not cleaning the stone properly at the time.\nThen I started the grouting process. First I applied a stain protector to the stone to make cleaning the grout off easier. Then I used a wide joint grout (Ardex WJ50 - Aussie product I think). Can handle around 50mm gap.\nI applied generously and tried to scrape off the top as I went. Once it was firm I washed it off the stone too with wet sponges -  this took a long time, as the grout was nearly white and clouded up the stone.\nI realised there was a cloudy layer after it was totally set but I could easily clean it off with vinegar and water.\nIn the end I\u2019m really happy with it! More importantly - so is my wife.",
