Something like citristrip should work, but even acetone has trouble hurting HDPE. This is also why the paint is flaking off; nothing sticks to HDPE.\n\nOf course, test on a non visible area first.\n\nIf you want a non chemical option, try a soda blaster.

This seems like a cheaper option rather than replacing the whole tiles. Before I do that, I'm worried about the water pooling in the backyard. The yard slopes down to the flowerbed at the back and there is nowhere for the water to get other than slowing seeping into ground through gaps in tiles and flowerbed wall. Is there an inexpensive or DIY way to rectify this issue? ",

Your options for mitigating it are really only making a drain, or redoing it so it's graded to drain away from the house and remove the low area.\n\nInstalling a drain is going to be the least labor for you.  You'll need to lift up pavers, and then setup a drain to run to either a pipe, or to some kind of drywell.  Considering you'll need to place it where you'll have people walking/sitting. Definitely should have it running to a drain pipe that runs towards the street or connects to the one your gutters drain into."
