        "content": "The situation between \n@OGesports\n and \n@pglesports\n where OG is presented a disqualification from the \n@dota2ti\n quals if \n@Ceb\n is not able to play tomorrow is justified and should not be changed. \n\nOG sees that the rules do not allow for stand-ins for this tournament and understands that there is a chance that Ceb's wife will be giving birth during this tournament which would create a scheduling conflict. In which, they had asked the tournament organizer beforehand for an exception for Ceb's special case in case of his absence. In which PGL responded with an One Day Stand In exception for the team. You can argue whether this was sufficient or not for this special case as probably more stand in time should be allowed. However, no other team competing in this tournament has had this exception made for them as far as I know. \n\nChoices were given in advance for OG to play with a stand-in in Open Qualifiers or take a chance with Ceb for the Closed Qualifiers. OG has to own up to their OWN decision on bearing the consequences as OG fully understands the gravity of the situation and decided to compete with Ceb as a part of its 5 man roster anyways. \n\nFast forward to now, that this foreseen possible scenario has come to be with the birthing of the child in conflict with the competition. In which I want to congratulate Ceb for his child and commend him for prioritizing this special moment over playing the qualifier. However, OG is only now publicly voicing the problem of the inflexible rules of the stand-in situation after the fact. \n\nWhile I do agree that the rules do not allow for stand-ins is silly as emergencies do happen and stand ins should be allowed in the event of an emergency. However, the time to change such said rule is not now. It should be done before the tournament has started or after the tournament has concluded for the competitive integrity of the tournament. If rules are allowed to be changed in the middle of the tournament at the whimsical of a team's wishes, what would be the point of having rules? As all teams and players should play on equal footing and be treated the same. That is what gives meaning to competition. \n\nI would applaud OG if they were to stand up for this problem before or after the tournament. But the fact that only now OG is publicly bringing up this issue while facing the possibility of being disqualified by PGL is an attempt to strongarm and pressure PGL with its vast fan base into complying to the wishes of OG and allowing further exceptions to be made for the team. Competitive integrity should not be compromised for a team that has already been granted unfair leniency due to the given circumstance. \n\nIn the future, I hope that tournament organizers who do not allow for stand ins to change their rules to be more lenient so that these extraordinary circumstances can be covered.\n\n---\n\nSource: [Sneyking X](https://x.com/SneykingGaming/status/1804357316550234470)",
