Despite trying various local brands, my intuition suggests they may not be authentic, as many taste like caramelized sugar. I've also sampled commercial honeys available in grocery stores, and I find Langese, Capilano, and Sue Bee seems to be genuine, albeit pricier options. However, I prefer to support local brands and would appreciate recommendations within that category.",

            "Bakit pag Pinoy subs, pag nag popost ako auto downvote, kahit sa mga comments minsan na in general I'm just thanking and replying the person who gave me advice? Ang weird lang kasi parang may mali sa ginagawa ko pero sinesearch ko naman yung tanong ko sa subreddit and wala pa talagang nakatanong nung tanong ko na specific sa situation ko. Comparing this to foreign subs/non-pinoy subs, wala pang nag d-downvote sakin for simply asking a question? I don't really care about the karma itself, curious lang ako kasi napansin ko ganito sa mga pinoy subs that I've been on but hindi talaga sa non-pinoy ones?",
            "I forgot how learning can be fun.\n\nMost parts of my life, I often hated learning in school. I cram and delay things cause I just wanna do things that I enjoy like playing games and scrolling through soc meds.\n\nRight now, I blame myself for creating these unhealthy habits. I'm struggling to do things at work. Hays. Totoo talaga na kung ano yung ginawa mo nung nasa school ka, yun din ang dadalhin mo pag nasa workforce ka na. \n\nI'm tired of disappointing myself and my superiors.",
