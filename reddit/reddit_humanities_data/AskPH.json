Ang weird lang kasi parang may mali sa ginagawa ko pero sinesearch ko naman yung tanong ko sa subreddit and wala pa talagang nakatanong nung tanong ko na specific sa situation ko. Comparing this to foreign subs/non-pinoy subs, wala pang nag d-downvote sakin for simply asking a question? I don't really care about the karma itself, curious lang ako kasi napansin ko ganito sa mga pinoy subs that I've been on but hindi talaga sa non-pinoy ones?",
