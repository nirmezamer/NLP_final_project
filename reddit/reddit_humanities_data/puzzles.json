The black cells may have numbers indicating how many bulbs must surround them, adding to the strategic depth.\n\nAs you will quickly notice, the placement of the bulbs becomes quite tricky and you have to use logical exclusion methods to get your grid filled.\n\n___\n\n**Features**\n\n* Everyday I release a new puzzle (daily challenge)\n* Track your solving time and compete against other players (leaderboards)\n* A weekly challenge for geniuses\n* Guide with solving strategies\n* Profile with stats about your skill level & progress",
