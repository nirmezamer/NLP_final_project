            ">!I think it is B.!< I think this will be complicated to explain in text, but the triangles inside the triangles directly above and below the target shapes correspond with the directions that the lines go inside the target shapes, so the missing shape will have a horizontal line.\n\nThe parallel lines in the triangles to the left and right of the target shapes seem to correlate to the lines inside the target shapes. (Three lines in the top left match the three lines in the hexagon, the two lines in the bottom left with the twin lines in the square, one line in both of the right side shapes mean the missing shape will have one line)\n\nNow for the arrows pointing left and right. The arrow in the same quarter circle as the triangular target shape is pointing left, the shape is black. The black square also has a left arrow. So the missing shape has a right arrow and will be white like the hexagon) \n\nAll of that is true about both B and E, but B fits better because the line is centered like on the other target shapes, and the target shapes include a triangle with 3 sides, square with 4, hexagon with 5, so the other being a pentagon with 6 continues that pattern. Whereas E would be a repeated shape.",

If:\n\n* the arrows correspond to >!the fill, then left=dark and right=light.!<\n* the triangle's >!orientation corresponds to the lines' orientation--but note there are 8 possible triangle orientations and we see 3, how can they correspond to 2 possible orientations?

We could take 1 to mean 3 black, as if the BR figure were 3 black lines as opposed to a dark shape with 2 white lines. In which case 3=2, 1=3, and 2=1.!<\n\nThen we >!have nothing corresponding to the shape of the polygon, except that (if the BR figure is meant to be a square and not a rounded square) we have polygons of sides 3, 4, and 5--so the best answer may be B because it has 1 horizontal line, a light fill, and a distinct number of sides.!<",
            "Looks like a trick question to me. It says \"fill in the blank\"--no mention of the question mark or any sort of pattern. I'd fill in all those little blank circles and dare them to call me on it.\n\nEdit: Might actually fill in all the blank areas just in case..\n\nEdit 2: could also fill in all the blank spaces just among the letters of \"the blank\" if we're feeling extra sassy.

            "Since I\u2019m a nerd I asked ChatGPT to see what would happen. \n\nTo solve the puzzle, let's identify the pattern in the given shapes within the circle.\n\nObserving the shapes, we can deduce the following patterns:\n- The shapes are paired along the diagonals.\n- The shape pairs consist of two elements: the type of shape and the internal pattern.\n\nLet's analyze each pair of shapes:\n\n1. Top left and bottom right: \n   - Top left: Two triangles facing each other.\n   - Bottom right: Two triangles facing apart (but the internal pattern consists of two parallel lines).\n\n2. Top right and bottom left:\n   - Top right: A pentagon with vertical lines.\n   - Bottom left: A parallelogram with vertical lines.\n\nFrom these patterns, we notice the following:\n- The shapes change form but share similar internal patterns (like lines, either vertical or horizontal).\n- The shapes in corresponding positions have complementary forms.\n\nGiven this, the missing shape (center left) must complement the center right shape, which is two horizontal lines within a rectangle.\n\nSince the missing shape must follow the internal pattern of the opposite shape:\n- Option A shows two horizontal lines, which matches the pattern seen in the shape across the diagonal from it (the two lines). \n\nThus, the correct answer is **A**.",
