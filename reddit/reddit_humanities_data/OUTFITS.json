            "It is a great color for you.  What about a fashion corset on the outside of the dress? Its not exactly a quick fix, because you have to spend a couple weeks getting used to wearing one, but I think that could be really cute with that dress.  I do believe there is a subreddit somewhere all about corset wearing.  They could probably point you in the right direction",
