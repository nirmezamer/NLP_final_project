            "I'm more distracted by the bra straps, and think that a strapless shaper with a boy cut or longer leg area would be a great investment for styles like this. Also, you could consider getting a sheer kimono style wrap to wear with it if you're truly self conscious. You look great, but trying to go without at least bust support won't work with this dress probably.",
            "I think if you\u2019re not going to feel comfortable in the dress even with shape wear, you should just get rid of it even though you like it. There are plenty of other types of dresses that are way more forgiving than a tight bodycon.",

It\u2019s not exactly a quick fix, because you have to spend a couple weeks getting used to wearing one, but I think that could be really cute with that dress.  I do believe there is a subreddit somewhere all about corset wearing.  They could probably point you in the right direction",
            "It is a pretty color.  I'm not a fan of the dress itself because it reminds me of a sheet .  Look up that color dress o bet you can find something prettier in that nice color .  I'd also be worried the top would fall too"
