        "content": "Hello all! We wanted to provide a quick note to the whole community regarding content removal inquiries & concerns. Please take a moment to review the following FAQ. \ud83d\udc96\n  \n  \n**Why do we remove content requested by influencers?**\n  \nIf we don't remove content that is requested by influencers, they might file a copyright claim through Reddit instead. Any subbreddit that accumulates too many copyright strikes will lead to the subreddit getting banned.\n  \nWe require proof of identity directly from the influencer for any content removal requests. This ensures that the influencer themselves, not their lawyer or team, is making the request. \n  \nReddit does not require proof of identity for copyright claims, meaning that fans or their team, not necessarily the influencer, could be the ones filing these claims. All content that receives a copyright claim is required by Reddit to be [immediately removed](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043515291-What-is-the-DMCA), *without judgement* (regardless of whether the claim is valid). Click [here to read more on Reddit\u2019s copyright claim policy](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043080152-What-is-Reddit-s-policy-on-repeat-copyright-infringement) and [here for more information about the DMCA Safe Harbor law](https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/DMCA-QA.pdf). \n  \n**How will I know if my content was removed by mods or Reddit?**\n  \nSince this update, we have always been transparent about influencer removal requests and will continue to be. We have no reason to hide this information or lie about it. If an influencer requests a removal, we **will** inform you.\n  \n- If your content was removed by mods: we will state this within the removal reason via modmail or comment.\n- If your content was removed by Reddit: You'll see \"[content removed by Reddit in response to a copyright notice]\" within your post or comment. \n- If your removal reason does not state any of the 2 reasons listen above: it was removed for violating [one of our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LAinfluencersnark/about/rules/), which will also be stated within your removal reason, or for violating [Reddit\u2019s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). \n  \n  \nWe don't enjoy removing content but we have no choice but to comply. This approach ensures transparency and helps keep the community safe from bans.\n  \nThanks for reading, and if you have any questions please feel free to message us via modmail or leave a comment below and we will try our best to answer them!",

            "Ok.\u00a0 I understand the system .\u00a0 wasn't sure how things worked .ty",
            "I didn\u2019t realize there was a name for that. Thank you. Nice post btw, that\u2019s a great way to explain it. I know they legally have to pull them down. I meant the whole process after that and how they handle the claims. \nPeople are getting accounts banned bc of all the claims.",
            "Yeah the whole process after the original claim yeah. And also how they decide to ban subs and users. I\u2019ll take a look at it later when I have time to actually read it, thank you. \n\nAn account got banned bc they got 20-25 copyright claims over two days. It was obviously someone targeting that account. Seems like the Reddit automations would pick up on that. Everything is automated \ud83d\ude02 love it",
            "Having the same issues with copyright claims. People are losing accounts and subreddits are getting banned. Once a sub gets banned it\u2019s very difficult to get another one open about the same subject. \n\nI understand why Reddit pulls things down when they get copyright claims. But something is wrong with their system. All anyone has to do is fill in the blanks on the claim and reddit pulls it. Most of the ones that I\u2019ve actually gotten info back on were filed using fake names and addresses. \n\nMost dont file the appeals because you need to give your own name and address. Because it is possible for the person that filed the claim to get that information. Idk about probable but possible. Just need to fill in the blanks like the original claims though, all you really need is an email that works. \n\nAs long as it\u2019s things that have been publicly shared, we\u2019re allowed to use those pics and videos under fair use. As long as it\u2019s being used for \u201ccriticism, commentary, education etc.\u201d",
            "[deleted]",
            "Woah so basically anything on here can be copyright claimed. I\u2019ve seen a few posts about actual celebrities get removed in the pop culture subs for copyright and I always wondered, interestingg\ud83e\udd28",
            "I'm not well informed on this topic nor I follow this sub close enough to know how often this happens or with which influencers it happens the most but I still have a few questions;\n\n- I saw a few posts about one influencer getting removed that were including her snaps and I always thought this was sort of an agreement between reddit and Snapchat bc basically you can't really post a platform specific content onto another without permission otherwise you'll just be stealing from their business. But as it turns out it was probably the influencer's request and can't blame her either bc she would have earned from views on that platform.\n\n- so while I find these kind of requests valid from an influencers point of view, what happens if I just post a thread with no copyrighted material but just a controversial topic around their name? Can they still claim copyright on those and on what basis really?\n\n- this one isn't that important but you say you only accept requests from the influencers themselves, aren't their teams or lawyers or whoever they have their legal representatives, what stops you from complying with those requests?",
            "1) If you\u2019d like to know whether or not a specific influencer is on the removal list, you can send us a modmail and we\u2019d be happy to let you know. \n2) It doesn\u2019t necessarily matter if the content refrains from copyrighted material. As per Safe Harbor laws, any copyright claimed content is immediately removed. It can only be reinstated if a counter notice is made, which is rare because users don\u2019t want to dox themselves or be involved in legal disputes. You can read more [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043515291-What-is-the-DMCA) and [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043517891-What-is-a-counter-notice-and-in-what-circumstances-should-I-file-one). \n3) We will only speak with influencers directly otherwise we can\u2019t verify they are who they say they are. Lawyers generally go through Reddit anyways, they don\u2019t bother with mods.\n\nLet me know if this answered your questions!",
            "All info here is correct! Creating a new subreddit to replace the one that was banned is a violation of Reddit\u2019s rules which is why you\u2019ll see them being removed immediately.  \n  \nBut the flaws in the system isn\u2019t Reddit's fault. The issue is the DMCA Safe Harbor law itself: promptly taking down the content is the only way for Reddit to not lose a line of legal defense. Reddit does not have to validate any claims - in fact, they are **required** to take down any notices **without judgement**.\n\n> *The main point of the safe harbor regime is that an OSP should be able to protect itself from allegations of copyright infringement with respect to content submitted to the OSP by its end-users, whether those allegations are valid or not, without making such judgments, by following the notice-and-take-down procedure.*\nhttps://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/DMCA-QA.pdf",
            "Not only posts can be removed - comments can be removed for copyright as well. See below for examples of comments being removed by Reddit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hornf1d4z4d1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed148432474f6c96dc8d72517e5e96d7bcb45b98"

This will allow us to hone in on what the community finds acceptable regarding previously banned sensitive topics.\n\nDuring this trial period, we hope to maintain a community where you can snark influencers in a\u00a0**lighthearted**\u00a0way. We would still like users to provide critique without resorting to bullying, excessively negative criticisms or highly personal attacks, so we will continue to monitor posts closely. We count on you, our community, to report any content that you feel crosses the line!\n\nFrom this point forward, we ask users to please utilize our new post flair system:\n\n* TW: Sensitive Content - any discourse dealing with the nature of\u00a0DV, SA, DA, SH\n* TW: Appearances - any discourse relating to appearances\n* Celebrity Snarks - any celebrity topics\n\nFlairs allow users to easily skip threads involving these topics and prevent potential flame wars.\n\nWith all this being said, your feedback is what matters. The comment section of this thread and our modmail is open to your ideas and criticisms. We are a community, and we hope for everyone to have their voice heard in the changes we aim to implement. We can\u2019t wait to see your witty and creative snark posts!\n\nFor additional information regarding LAinfluencersnark, see this\u00a0[sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LAinfluencersnark/comments/1d9apn6/faq_understanding_the_content_removals/)\u00a0about influencer removals and content requests.",
