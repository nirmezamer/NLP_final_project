Here is the rest of the information they provided:\n\n>IKEA is releasing a new range of Chest of Drawers (COD) sometime in the summer that is designed be more tip-proof.  \n>  \n>The new range will have a built in feature that only allows one drawer to be open at a time. If the unit is attached to the wall, it allows for all drawers to be used as normal. The VIHALS dresser already has this function.  \n>  \n>Essentially every single COD article is being discontinued. The new range coming the summer **WILL NOT** be called MALM, HEMNES, etc.  \n>  \n>95% of current COD units are discontinued as of Jan/Feb24, but some are being replaced by temporary versions with the new tip function until Summer.  \n>  \n>The temporary range includes popular articles like MALM, HEMNES, BRIMNES, and others. But it is temporary in nature so it's difficult to say how much stock individual stores will have of any given article.  \n>  \n>If your store is already out of one of the discontinued COD articles, it's unlikely they will have more unless there is a temporary version of that article.\n\nEdit:   \nPS.

Pieces of the shelf scratched/taken out, shelves and overall wood pieces are thinner than previous versions.\n \nIt\u2019s slightly discoloured to be a cream rather than its previous white. Usually for the shelves you could use both sides of the shelf and display whichever looked better outwards but now one side is literally horrific to look at, rough, textured as if someone folded over the white coating or someone experimented with 3D art and failed, a massive line going through it, as I mentioned earlier thinner shelves which look unnatural and cheap next to my older billy bookcases.\n\nI\u2019m devastated at the decrease of quality, it\u2019s really an insult to consumers as dramatic as that sounds. The photos speak for themselves. Not sure if ikea is cutting corners or changed manufacturers but this new level of quality is appalling, what happened? :(\n\nFor pics older Billy is on left while newest is on right. ",
