If the unit is attached to the wall, it allows for all drawers to be used as normal. The VIHALS dresser already has this function.  \n>  \n>Essentially every single COD article is being discontinued. The new range coming the summer **WILL NOT** be called MALM, HEMNES, etc.  \n>  \n>95% of current COD units are discontinued as of Jan/Feb24, but some are being replaced by temporary versions with the new tip function until Summer.  \n>  \n>The temporary range includes popular articles like MALM, HEMNES, BRIMNES, and others. But it is temporary in nature so it's difficult to say how much stock individual stores will have of any given article.  \n>  \n>If your store is already out of one of the discontinued COD articles, it's unlikely they will have more unless there is a temporary version of that article.\n\nEdit:   \nPS.

            "Look for a Bariatric chair-and-a-half or loveseat! That sizing will be more comfortable and have a higher weight rating than a regular sized chair. Also look for \u201cheavy duty\u201d or \u201cbig and tall\u201d seating. Those are the buzz words in furniture talk for making chairs with heavier weight limits",

Maybe something like the odger chairs could work, but it'd be hard to test how they perform long term. I'm sorry to say you might be looking at custom/specialized furniture.",

            "Hey, real idea without being mean here. I'd consider finding the chairs that will let her sit comfortably, then work with a local woodworker to build boxy support frames underneath them that would be better suited to higher weightliads because they'd be made of studier wood.\n\nBut with all due respect, the weight that requires accomodation is so far from the tested capacity, that you would probably have a better experience to search for vintage chairs made from the studier materials used before fast fashion furniture became a thing. \n\nAt the end of the day, we are talking about your loved one's safety, and also dignity. Breaking a cheap chair is not going to be good for anyone's self-esteem. It may be best to invest in 1-2 chairs engineered to accommodate bodies that large, and stick them at the head and foot of the table so they match, then get cheaper/more fashionable chairs to round out the \"set\".",

One of their dining chairs the \"orb chair\" has metal legs and frame with upholstered top, wide, very comfortable to sit for long periods of time. They are more expensive than Ikea but this chair is solid. Try Costco for office chairs"
