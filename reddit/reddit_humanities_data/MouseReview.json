            "Recomendations for a new mouse? I'm using the Mamba wireless, loved the mambas because they're big... not just in length but in height! I'm surprised how low profile most mice are. Any recomendations for a high profile mouse?",

            "I was thinking of buying the pulsar x2v2 mini nezuko version simply because I like the way it looks but I wanted to ask are there any common issues with this mouse? How good is the quality, or if it starts getting issues relatively quickly etc. I'm planning on using this mouse for a long time so yeah. Any help is appreciated :)",
            "Has anyone else had scroll wheel issues with the Pulsefire Haste platform? I've gone through 3 RMA's with the Pulsefire Haste Wireless and the PHW2 all to do with the same exact scroll wheel issue. \n\nScrolling up or down initiates a scroll in the opposite direction every few steps. I can't be the only one if every mouse I've had from them has had the same issue. Unless I'm somehow scrolling wrong which I don't think is possible lmao",
            "should i buy the g pro x1 or save more money for the g pro x2? currently im using the aria xd 7, but my hand is to big and i cant do palm very well. i was wondering if the diference between the g prox 1 and 2 are that big to justify saving money for another month.",

            "Hi All, looking for a relatively inexpensive mouse for my gf's birthday. She is left-handed so specifically looking for either an ambidextrous or left-handed mouse that is preferably pink. She mostly plays indie and rogue-like games, so high performance mice are probably not required for her gaming needs, so anything below \u00a330 would be ideal. Based in the UK - any suggestions would be amazing!"
