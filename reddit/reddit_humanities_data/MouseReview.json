            "New to this. I like lightweight mice. Don't like ones with holes. Current options are Nixeus Revel (tried it at my friends house and liked it alot) and VXE R1 Pro. Sadly theyre both sold out. I would also appreciate any info on where to buy recommended mice. I mostly play shooters like Valorant. Open to more options and opinions! \n\n* **Games**: Valorant, Overwatch, FPS in general.\n* **Hand Preference**: Right\n* **Budget**\u00a0Around $60 (Not too set on budget but don't want to spend past $80)\n* **Hand Size:**\u00a018cmx10cm\n* **Grip**: Palm\n* **Weight**: Preferred light. Light-Medium\n* **Sensitivity** - 800\n* **Connectivity** - Wired.",
            "I have been using, without too many complaints, a G502 Lightspeed for many years. I could do with a lighter mouse, as I pick it up a lot during usage and I could do without that strain. The shape works for my grip though.\n\n* **Games:** used to be a big RTS then MOBA players, as I grew older I mostly play strategic games with the mouse, or controller stuff. That's what being a 45+ years old games means, not having good wrists anymore.\n* **Hand Preference:** right (even if I'm left handed :))\n* **Budget:** anything goes\n* **Hand Size:** 20x11\n* **Grip:** Claw if I'm engaged in what I'm doing, if I'm very relaxed I Palm the mouse. Mostly Claw though.\n* **Weight:** looking for something light. Definitely lighter than the G502 that is 105g if I'm not mistaken\n* **Sensitivity:** I run at a constant 1000dpi\n* **Connectivity:**\u00a0No Preference, using my mouse wired at the moment, even if it's wireless because I got bored of recharging it every few days\n\nEdit: Forgot to thank everyone in advance!",
            "I'm looking for a wired ergonomic mouse where bigger than average thumb buttons and a scroll press that don't need a lot of press down force are the most important features. Previous mice:\n\n* Steelseries Rival 310 (good form, prefect thumb buttons and light scroll click)\n* Roccat Kone Pro (good form, good thumb button, light scroll click)\n* Deathadder v2 wired (good from, good thumb buttons but heavy scroll click)\n* Logitech Pro X (mouse too small, thumb buttons too small, didn't even try the scroll button as the mouse was so tiny)\n* Steelseries Prime+ (current mouse, good from but should not be even a mm smaller, thumb button too small, scroll button too heavy)\n\nPurchase Advice Request\n\n* Games (Primary played games here)\n* Hand Preference (Right)\n* Budget (under \u20ac120)\n* Hand Size (length 18.5cm & width 10cm)\n* Grip (Between Palm & Claw)\n* Weight (No preference, lighter if possible but least important)\n* Sensitivity (previous owned mice were used at between 2400 and 4500 DPI)\n* Connectivity (Wired)",

            "Hey, I\u2019m looking to replace my m705. Already tried Pro X Superlight, returned it because it was too long and had some clicking issues. Bluetooth would be a plus since I use it often when I work. I\u2019m currently thinking about the Cobra Pro which was on discount at 100\u20ac and might be more adapted to my small hand or the ROG keris wireless aimpoint.

            "I currently use the Deathadder V2 begrudgingly. I have owned the G600, G502 Proteus Core, DA, Rival 700, and Model O-. Although I have preferred the shape of the Rival 700 and it's been the closest thing I've loved, I didn't like the sensor or heavy weight.

            "My mouse finally died, so I'm looking to get a replacement. \n\nI mostly play a lot of fpses, and mmos. I'm not looking for anything fancy, having 2 side buttons would be really nice as I've gotten pretty accustomed to having them. Something Bluetooth would be really nice, as the reason this one died is because the wire hung down enough to get ran over. My max budget is 20 bucks, not including shipping. I don't need anything special just something that works, and has a few side buttons.",
            "Currently have a G305 and it's been great, but it has a scroll wheel issue.

It's trimod, nicely packaged, shockingly lightweight, comfy to hold, smooth to the hands, and feels like I won a lottery. The software is great too. The scroll wheel is addicting to use, but found it protruding. I hope this mouse would last long.",
