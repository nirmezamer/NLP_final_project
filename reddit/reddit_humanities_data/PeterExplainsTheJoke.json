One of the bioshock games had a character that was very hot, to the point that the gaming community NEEDED porn of her. 3d modeling and animation went through a revolution on the same scale as film gaining color all for the purpose of making porn of this one character. Now, years later, the same technology allows for a large amount of overwatch porn without having to revolutionize animation",

This isn't quite true - source Filmmaker predates both of them considerably - but the ease of access to animating tools is believed to be partially responsible for Overwatch having so much porn made about it.",
