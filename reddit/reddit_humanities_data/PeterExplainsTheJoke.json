Before Fortnite became a thing they were wildly successful making GTA V videos and, more specific to this post, GMOD videos. Most of them are still around and good friends with each other, and still successfully making videos, but their hayday was 2014-2018. This post with these specific characters are their character models from their GMOD videos.\n\nLink - Moo Snuckel (he recently announced he is stepping away from Youtube as a full time job, but is still friends with most of the crew)\n\nBuzz Lightyear - H20 Delirious\n\nDorito's bag - IAmWildcat (or just Wildcat)\n\nLuigi - Vanoss\n\nZoidberg -Dathi de Nogla (or just Nogla)\n\nFinn - BasicallyIDoWrk\n\nMario - Mini Ladd (he is no longer friends with anyone in the group due to purposefully distancing himself from the group and, most importantly, being outted as a pedophile)\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/zdLxz2LJ4v)\n\nu/CipherWrites\n\n\u201cran out of time.\nthis is what I found\n\nSomething to do with Imod?\nMoo Snuckle (Toon Link), Daithi de Nogla (Dr. Zoidberg), H2ODelirious (Buzz Lightyear), VanossGaming (Luigi), I AM WILDCAT (Nacho Cheese Doritos), BasicallyIDoWrk (Finn from Adventure Time), TheGamingTerroriser (The Terminator)\n\nreferencing content creators\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/UOV8RkXdwy) \n\nu/SinnerOfSloth779\n\n\u201cVanoss gaming crew, it is their old gmod models\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/LsgKIm0X6I)\n\nu/BLAM-Boozled\n\n\u201cPeter\u2019s 16th Testicle here.\n\nI may be wrong but I think this refers to the Vanoss Crew. The Doritos and Mario are what giving me that idea.\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/8BFqQCv8SZ)\n\n[Nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/1Qj2AKY1uB)\n\n[Same gmod](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/O9TUjDRgii)\n\nu/Aidan_Baidan\n\n\u201cHey folks, avid videogame enthusiast Chris Griffin here.\n\nThese characters are relevant to one another through a YouTube channel known as Vanoss Gaming, which was largely popular in the mid 2010s for their Garry\u2019s Mod and Grand Theft Auto V gameplay videos. In Garry\u2019s Mod, the popular sandbox mod for Half-Life 2, there is a massive community workshop in which people can upload custom maps, weapons, and even player models. The recurring members of Vanoss Gaming\u2019s YouTube videos used the pictured characters as their player models in-game, hence the joke of them being pictured in one place.\n\nChris Griffin out.\u201d - good explanation \ud83d\udc4d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/fVT7TVoZHC)\n\nu/ChillyAmber\n\n\u201cVanoss crew but It\u2019s probably also about how awful mini ladd was because he groomed some minors (he often used the Mario player model in gmod)\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/ZLGh5XO1S8)\n\nu/Chiefdragonborn\n\n\u201cLooks like an old meme from a [gamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanossgaming/s/KNvtRSnbn4)\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/WDOJg4RjfP)\n\n[Nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/wXk7vQwOPm)\n\nu/Solid-Positive6751\n\n\u201cIt appears to be the character models used by the Vanoss crew before they got their \u201cofficial\u201d ones in Garry\u2019s Mod. Going left to right is Moo Snuckle, H2O Delirious, Uncertain/Maybe Terroriser, Vanoss, Daithi de Nogla, BasicallyIdoWrk, and Mini Ladd.
