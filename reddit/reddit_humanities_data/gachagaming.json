        "content": "This thread is the place to post any questions or random thoughts that you may have for the community. We have an army of veteran summoners who are happy to share their opinions and recommendations. Whether you are new to the genre or a grizzled veteran, you can use this thread to ask for: \n\n* Help choosing which gacha game to start \n* Recommendations on using different emulators \n* Recommendations on finding a new gacha game to play \n* Help remembering the name of an old gacha game  \n* Updates on how games are doing from current players (\u201cHow is \\[game\\] these days?\u201d) \n* Any sort of advice relating to gacha games at all \n\nThis is also the place to ask general questions, like  \n\n* What people\u2019s favorite games or types of games are \n* How do people feel about a particular game feature or event \n* How do people feel about the monetization in whatever game \n* What do abbreviations mean \n* Where people get their news / information \n* What are people\u2019s favorite content creators \n* Even topics that are only indirectly related to gacha gaming, like happenings in the subreddit, international politics, celebrity gossip, etc.  \n\nReally, any post that is just asking a question belongs here.  \n\nYou can feel free to talk about or ask about anything at all in this thread, but just don\u2019t be surprised if your off-topic question is downvoted and you get no answers. If you are looking for game-specific help, you may ask for it here, but you are more likely to get better answers by posing those questions in their game-specific subreddits.  \n\nIf you want to contribute, please read the request thoroughly, and then make sure not to recommend something that they already tried. Please reply without bashing games or arguing with other recommenders \u2013 this is not a win-lose thing. Helpful replies should include the full names of anything. Keep in mind that new summoners may not know what \u201cGI\u201d or \u201cFGO\u201d or even \u201cF2P\u201d means, and even if they do then it\u2019s helpful to spell things out so that the results are more searchable.  \n\nRule #1 still applies, so make sure to keep it friendly. Religious and political discussions, personal information, and other such comments will be moderated. Make sure to follow The Reddiquette. With that said, feel free to talk about day-to-day life here and make acquaintance with your friendly gacha gamer neighbors.",

            "What game should I play?\n\nI like the aesthetics of honkai star rail and genshin impact. As for gameplay/combat, I like turn based combat or action combat that is very fast in movement and attacks(kinda like Nier automata). I want to be able to play on PC. More f2p friendly is better.",

            "What game should I play as a ex-FEH refugee? I always liked grinding and maxxing characters but couldn't stand the insane powercreep. Tried Genshin and hated the low rates, played for like 20-30 hrs and didn't get a single 5*. I also prefer games with auto-battle so I don't have to actively grind. Any recommendations?",

            "Good day, I'm searching for gacha games and hoping if anyone could help recommend me one. Who knows, i might find diamonds among recommendations that you guys offer. I prefer a simple game like turn based. For example, my main games are fgo, uma musume and brown dust 2. I don't like open world games. I once tried genshin and wuwa upon my friend's recommendation but uninstalled it before reaching a week. Do you guys have gacha games that i could try?"
