We have an army of veteran summoners who are happy to share their opinions and recommendations. Whether you are new to the genre or a grizzled veteran, you can use this thread to ask for: \n\n* Help choosing which gacha game to start \n* Recommendations on using different emulators \n* Recommendations on finding a new gacha game to play \n* Help remembering the name of an old gacha game  \n* Updates on how games are doing from current players (\u201cHow is \\[game\\] these days?\u201d) \n* Any sort of advice relating to gacha games at all \n\nThis is also the place to ask general questions, like  \n\n* What people\u2019s favorite games or types of games are \n* How do people feel about a particular game feature or event \n* How do people feel about the monetization in whatever game \n* What do abbreviations mean \n* Where people get their news / information \n* What are people\u2019s favorite content creators \n* Even topics that are only indirectly related to gacha gaming, like happenings in the subreddit, international politics, celebrity gossip, etc.  \n\nReally, any post that is just asking a question belongs here.  \n\nYou can feel free to talk about or ask about anything at all in this thread, but just don\u2019t be surprised if your off-topic question is downvoted and you get no answers. If you are looking for game-specific help, you may ask for it here, but you are more likely to get better answers by posing those questions in their game-specific subreddits.  \n\nIf you want to contribute, please read the request thoroughly, and then make sure not to recommend something that they already tried. Please reply without bashing games or arguing with other recommenders \u2013 this is not a win-lose thing. Helpful replies should include the full names of anything. Keep in mind that new summoners may not know what \u201cGI\u201d or \u201cFGO\u201d or even \u201cF2P\u201d means, and even if they do then it\u2019s helpful to spell things out so that the results are more searchable.  \n\nRule #1 still applies, so make sure to keep it friendly.

Tried to find some new game and nowadays seem like people mostly talking about action or open-world gacha game which don't really suited me.\n\nEDIT: A game that didn't release but soon or a game only in JP is okay too",

            "Looking for a grindy game with lots to do. Currently playing only Nikke which except for the same 10 minute dailys doesn't really offer anything.\nI couldn't really get into HSR and Genshin, not really a fan of open worlds. Several years ago I played Kings Raid, DFFOO and Dragalia Lost. Graphics aren't too important, I really like that kind of bad PS2 era 3D artstyle. Fan service would be nice but isn't a must. Thanks!",

I tried Genshin impact and honkai star rail but I found out I don't like playing open world 3d games on my phone. I'd prefer something more akin to classic final fantasy so turn based is a plus. Also graphically I don't mind if it's jrpg style but I'm not looking for a waifu collector. Money wise I wouldn't mind spending 5-10 euro per month if it makes the game more fun but that's also my limit so it should be budget friendly. I already pre-registered for sword of convallaria but maybe there is a different game for me.",

Do you expect the launch to have significant issues that need to be fixed? What story will the all-seeing first month revenue report tell? *Let us know below!*\n\nSome example topics that we used to inquire about as part of our Predictions pre-launch threads:\n\n* What aspect of the game are you most excited for (ie. Story, Combat, Characters, Exploration)?\n* Will the game be well-optimized upon release? If not, what will the biggest issue be?\n* What will the game's revenue be for the first calendar month? Where will it rank on the chart?\n* Will the game have a major social/cultural/monetization controversy at launch? If so, what will it be?\n* Where will the Google Play Store and App Store ratings sit following the game's first week?\n\n*Unfortunately, Reddit no longer offers the native Predictions post type that we used to publish, and we are still looking for a suitable way to replace them while maintaining the original gamified intent.

Overall, if the action game play feels exciting and challenging enough then the game will probably do really well in the long term.  The interesting character designs will also probably end up being the game's main selling point",

Having quest interrupted midway because of a character is taken, not having layered map for exploration. There is a lot of QOL updates to like Paimon\u2019s EN Voice got a lot better, opening/exploring counts towards dailies. The Fontaine quest was also arguably a step up.\n\nLike I can understand people are burnt out playing genshin for a few years. But how did this few years of enjoyment turn into this monstrous hate towards Hoyo? \n\nThe only drama I heard was the 3 rolls but wasn\u2019t that already proven to be out of context as it was actually like 10+3?\n\nHow did the gacha community become this dog shit water pile mess right now? I have to be missing context here right.\n\nDoes anyone know what happened? \n\n\nEdit: 10+3",
