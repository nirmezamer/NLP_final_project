Like yeah it's different. But you don't need too many anyway. And the requirement would be low every time. Both need an anclosure, a few armadillo, and either a chicken farm from brushes, or a spider farm for breeding armadillo with eyes.\n\nI'd rather have i'tresting way to get items than just drop on death.\n\nThat being said. Goats arnt endangered. Make them drop goat meat. Same for frogs. Same for other animals.",
