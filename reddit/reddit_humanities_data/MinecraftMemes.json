After lengthy internal debate, we have enumerated a list of changes that many users have been requesting for a long time. While these changes may seem jarring at first, we anticipate that the community will grow to become accustomed to and appreciate these modifications with time. These changes will be announced in approximately three hours in [this announcement video](https://youtu.be/5HxDA7HGg3c). After the premiere is over, we will be replying to this post with details.",
