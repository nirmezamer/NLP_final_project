            "just finished Slow Horses Season 1, Gary Oldman is brilliant as Jackson Lamb really looking forward to next seasons \n\nFollowing The Boys weekly, Episode 4 was diabolical \n\nAnd waiting for The Bear next week",
            "Presumed Innocent. A high level adult drama. Not just a thriller. It explores the tumultuousness of marriage. Jake G really is at his best playing Rusty a complex character. The dialogue is amazing. It gives you a peek into inner desires and weaknesses we all have. \n\nI went in expecting suspense, but came out loving how mature it was. I was completely pulled in by the characters. Ruth Negga is also terrific as his wife. \n\nOnly 1 episode in so far, but I'd give it an 8.5",
            "**Detroiters**  \nDecided to give this show a try after seeing it recommended here. Wow. I haven't laughed this much since Cunk on Earth. The characters are likeable and natural. And someone on the writing team must be from Michigan!\n\n**Blue Lights S2** \n\nAlmost done and very much enjoying it. Seems like all the actors have unique faces.\n\n**Colin From Accounts S2**\n\nNo drop in quality from S1.",

            "**House of the Dragon** - I found myself not remembering some things after watching the first episode, so I binged S1. I enjoyed it SO much more than my original watch. I think I still had severe GOT PTSD before.\n\n\n**The Boys** - I'm on the pro team for this season, very much enjoy still",
            "My family and I started Wings last night. It\u2019s so fun! Can\u2019t wait to keep watching. Very underrated",
            "I don't usually bring up anime on here but since a lot of you liked Scavengers Reign I thought some of you might also like some of my favorite strange unique anime. They're not at all similar, just some more one of a kind shows, that are probably not for everyone but hopefully those that are into it will love them. There's a lot of different types of anime out there and usually only the mainstream ones ever get mentioned, so a lot of people think anime is all just like demon slayer, attack on titan, naruto etc. Also these are only 12 episodes (20 minutes each).\n\n**Mononoke** (2007 series on Netflix) - really unique art style kind of like woodblock art, very colorful. It was recently remastered so I could finally watch it in good quality when it came to netflix. Definitely a classic. It's basically short stories about a guy who exorcises demons by discovering the circumstances of the curse. I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix. And there's a new movie coming out next month for the 15th anniversary that looks [drop dead gorgeous.](https://youtu.be/0x-SryQQmRs)\n\n**Sonny Boy** (Hulu) - this is one of those trippy confusing shows with a non-linear timeline. It's about kids that end up in an alternate world/reality in a sort of Everything Everywhere All at Once sort of way. It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it.\n\nI actually have quite a lot more great unique anime I could mention, but idk if anyone is even gonna care or read this lol.",
            "Dark Matter: after a slow start, it just gets better and better\n\nTrying: the most underrated series on TV. Season 4 is great. Just want more and more episodes \n\nHouse of Dragon season 2: first episode was ok"
