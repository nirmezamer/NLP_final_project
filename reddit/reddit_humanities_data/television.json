            "**Detroiters**  \nDecided to give this show a try after seeing it recommended here. Wow. I haven't laughed this much since Cunk on Earth. The characters are likeable and natural. And someone on the writing team must be from Michigan!\n\n**Blue Lights S2** \n\nAlmost done and very much enjoying it. Seems like all the actors have unique faces.\n\n**Colin From Accounts S2**\n\nNo drop in quality from S1.",
            "Presumed Innocent. A high level adult drama. Not just a thriller. It explores the tumultuousness of marriage. Jake G really is at his best playing Rusty a complex character. The dialogue is amazing. It gives you a peek into inner desires and weaknesses we all have. \n\nI went in expecting suspense, but came out loving how mature it was. I was completely pulled in by the characters. Ruth Negga is also terrific as his wife. \n\nOnly 1 episode in so far, but I'd give it an 8.5",
            "**House of the Dragon** - I found myself not remembering some things after watching the first episode, so I binged S1. I enjoyed it SO much more than my original watch. I think I still had severe GOT PTSD before.\n\n\n**The Boys** - I'm on the pro team for this season, very much enjoy still",

            "I don't usually bring up anime on here but since a lot of you liked Scavengers Reign I thought some of you might also like some of my favorite strange unique anime. They're not at all similar, just some more one of a kind shows, that are probably not for everyone but hopefully those that are into it will love them. There's a lot of different types of anime out there and usually only the mainstream ones ever get mentioned, so a lot of people think anime is all just like demon slayer, attack on titan, naruto etc. Also these are only 12 episodes (20 minutes each).\n\n**Mononoke** (2007 series on Netflix) - really unique art style kind of like woodblock art, very colorful. It was recently remastered so I could finally watch it in good quality when it came to netflix. Definitely a classic. It's basically short stories about a guy who exorcises demons by discovering the circumstances of the curse. I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix. And there's a new movie coming out next month for the 15th anniversary that looks [drop dead gorgeous.](https://youtu.be/0x-SryQQmRs)\n\n**Sonny Boy** (Hulu) - this is one of those trippy confusing shows with a non-linear timeline. It's about kids that end up in an alternate world/reality in a sort of Everything Everywhere All at Once sort of way. It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it.\n\nI actually have quite a lot more great unique anime I could mention, but idk if anyone is even gonna care or read this lol.",
            "Dark Matter: after a slow start, it just gets better and better\n\nTrying: the most underrated series on TV. Season 4 is great. Just want more and more episodes \n\nHouse of Dragon season 2: first episode was ok",

            "\n**The Bad Kids** - Brilliant watch and brilliant ending. Chinese series streaming free on iQIYI.  Going to miss the adventures of Chaoyang, Pupu, and Yan Liang. \n\n**House of the Dragon S2** - Great premiere.  Noticed O\u2019Hara from **Warrior** as the blacksmith and hoping we see more of him.  Haven\u2019t read books but assume we will be. \n\n**Presumed Innocent** - random thoughts: Ruth Negga deserves way better. The DA, Nico, has to be one of the most punchable dudes ever. Not sure how I feel about the show otherwise so far. \n\n**Interview with the Vampire S2** - incredible show. Incredible. \n\n**Dark Matter** - it has officially hit the fan.  Finale is looking to be good. \n\n**Blue Lights S2** - Great cop show set in Belfast, Ireland. Love Stevie played by Martin McCann \n\n**The Lazarus Project S2** - really enjoying but also confuses me to no end lol.",

            "I'm still enjoying **Trying** but it still feels like quite the fall from the heights of S1-S2. It's like Apple TV saw the success of **Ted Lasso** and decided all of their comedies needed to be borderline saccharine to work.",
            "Presumed Innocent has been excellent so far.",
            "Any good spy series? Strong tacticool/operator vibes, nothing like a regular action like say, Reacher.\n\nA little more action, less slow burn tense mindgames so something like The Americans or even Homeland isn't also what I'm looking for right now.\n\nNot very comedic either. I've heard of the Recruit but a quick look at the trailers and it seems to have a little more humor than what I want. \n\nI've seen Jack Ryan and Terminal List. 24 is a classic, of course.\n\n**Thanks**",
            "***My So-Called Life*** \n\nIt's been on my watchlist for years, but I just started it on a whim the other day. I'm loving it. I'm only four episodes deep, but it's great. Claire Danes is amazing! It's wild to know she was only fifteen-years-old while filming it, because she was already a pretty great actor. \n\nI'm surprised by the amount of mature subjects the show has touched on in just a few episodes. This aired on ABC in 1994, and was a show ostensibly for teens, so it's wild to think they let this air (but then maybe it's also the reason it didn't last beyond one season). \n\nI'll say that having to watch Jared Leto is a bit of a negative, and so far his character is kind of an asshole. But who knows, maybe he'll have some kind of redemption arc that will make him more tolerable.\n\nBut overall, I'm really enjoying it, and I'll be sad when all nineteen episodes are over. I'm trying to remind myself that nineteen episodes is kind of the modern-day equivalent of 2.5 seasons, so that I'll feel less sad when there's no more.\n\n---\n\n**Can I get some recommendations for maybe 1990s\u20132000s coming-of-age dramedy series that are similar?** (Already watched ***Freaks & Geeks*** last year, which I loved.)",

            "I just discovered \u201cThe Boys.\u201d I have laughed out loud more in the past 4 hours than I have in 4 months. I\u2019m not going to bed until I finish season one (4 more episodes left)!\n\nAnd yes, I highly recommend it. Especially if you watched the first 5 seasons of Supernatural (Kripke!!).",
            "Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini.  I feel like I had seen this in the news over the years, but I in fact had no idea how it ended up. Made watching this going in blind fairly interesting.  7/10",
            "Finished MOVING, a Korean drama about people with superpowers. It was fantastic. The show starts small, focussing on just a few high school kids. The story slowly broadens to their parents, who they inherited their powers from, and it begins to get really wild.",
            "Deadloch with Kate Box. Law & Order meets The Office",
            "Wasn\u2019t this week but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning a few weeks ago I finished season 35 of The Simpsons. So I have officially seen all 768 episodes of the show. I don\u2019t know how it happened. It went by so fast. Even as the show got noticeably worse I couldn\u2019t turn to anything else because the Simpsons had quickly become my comfort show. I may have to give it a rest for a moment but boy do I miss those characters already.",
            "**Dead To Me**\n\nThis is funnier than it has every right to be.  Only note is that in S2, the Michelle actress really needs to go back to acting school because in her very first appearance, her emoting very clearly visibly telegraphed the upcoming relationship plot twist with Judy.  As a result I was very not surprised attest of the alls when they finally hooked up.  I've never been to drama class a day in my life and can maintain a poker face when a parent tries to act like they hadn't yelled at me last year for not letting their stupid idiot kid cheat at disc golf.  The other supporting characters were great:  Nick, Perez, the good-looking fella from Jury Duty; it's just that whoever directed Michelle didn't think to say, \"Hey, uh, dial back the male gaze a bit.\"  Also, if you're a fan of Married with Children, there is a very surprising near-reunion to be had in the penultimate episode.\n\n5/5, actually funny women to be found here.",

            "I\u2019m gonna get flack for this but I don\u2019t think I would enjoy **Shoresy** if it wasn\u2019t for the charisma of the actor who plays Shoresy. \n\nThe surrounding cast just doesn\u2019t stand out like the cast from Letterkenny. I can\u2019t tell the difference between two of main hockey players cause they look and act the same. One doesn\u2019t even speak or interact with the other cast. And the actor who plays Sanguinet looks and sounds like he\u2019s 16 years old. \n\nI obviously still like the show but I don\u2019t know how people like anything other than Shoresy the character.",
            "The Boys S4: I don't think it's the worst season or that the writing has taken a dip, but it is getting harder and harder to watch.

The new noir is hilarious as is the deeps arc. \n\nJames May in Japan, easy watching and interesting I hope he gets into some proper wacky shit.",

            "This season of Doctor Who started off rocky, got better with each episode leading to some absolutely amazing episodes of television with episodes 4 & 5 in particular, but did not stick the landing of the finale. It wasn't necessarily awful, just an anticlimactic end to what's been the best season of the show since Capaldi's last season 7 years ago.",

            "> Trying: the most underrated series on TV. Season 4 is great. Just want more and more episodes \n\nIt's so good. Just a lovely, lovely show. Whenever folks here mention how ***Ted Lasso*** fell off in quality, I always try to point them to ***Trying*** as a show that's even more feel-good, yet maintains its quality throughout.\n\nThis season does feel like a bit of a departure in terms of its focus. The focus has shifted to Princess and her story, so we're seeing less of Nikki and Jason's, but it's still so sweet and funny, and we're still getting to see all the various parents'/grandparents' growth.",

But I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend you at least consider giving ***Patriot*** a shot.\n\nIt's extremely funny, but not in the typical sense. I'd say it's more of a black comedy. I don't know quite how to describe it, but I usually say its tone is like the Coen brothers mixed with Wes Anderson. It's hilarious, poignant, thrilling, bizarre, bleak, and bittersweet.",

I don\u2019t think America/many parents were ready to deal with the issues. Yes, your child may be gay, have a drug problem or may be friends with someone who is. Or in my case, out partying on a school night when you\u2019re 15-16 years old and hung over the next morning during first period. Oops. Most of the storylines are still relevant today.

The show's kinda found the rhythm it likes and is leaning into it. \n\nAnd this isn't quite a criticism, but I noticed there's almost an unusual urgency to the pace of this season. Like it's *going* somewhere, and there's not a lot of time to experience the characters. I suppose it's mainly because we're kinda following Princess on this clue-by-clue treasure hunt, and lots of her racing to various locations. \n\nBut still, I think it's cool and interesting, and it's bold of the show to change up it's structure in this most recent season, which makes me wonder if it'll be the final one.",

            "> One of the more jaw-dropping segments of the documentary comes when Bob Knodel, one of the hosts on a popular Flat Earth YouTube channel, walks viewers through an experiment involving a laser gyroscope. As the Earth rotates, the gyroscope appears to lean off-axis, staying in its original position as the Earth's curvature changes in relation. \"What we found is, is when we turned on that gyroscope we found that we were picking up a drift. A 15 degree per hour drift,\" Knodel says, acknowledging that the gyroscope's behavior confirmed to exactly what you'd expect from a gyroscope on a rotating globe.\n\n> \"Now, obviously we were taken aback by that. 'Wow, that's kind of a problem,'\" Knodel says. \"We obviously were not willing to accept that, and so we started looking for ways to disprove it was actually registering the motion of the Earth.\"\n\n> Despite further experimental refinements, Knodel's gyroscope consistently behaves as if the Earth is round. Yet Knodel's beliefs seem unchanged when discussing the experiment at a Flat Earth meetup in Denver. \"We don't want to blow this, you know? When you've got $20,000 in this freaking gyro. If we dumped what we found right now, it would be bad. It would be bad. What I just told you was confidential,\" Knodel says to another Flat Earther in attendance.",

It was the little shit , like the parts about having your parent\u2019s business under your name , or paying off your parent\u2019s house that made it so relatable. The realest part to me was when the guy built his parent\u2019s house but it burned down cuz he did the electric wiring wrong. That\u2019s some shit my cousin would do. So sad to see S2 not have more of this :(",

Like Asian American get so few opportunities and the first season was great for a lot of reasons but one of which being representation. \n\nI feel bad for any Asian American who went for auditions of this to lose to them",

            "Two incredibly talented and somewhat underrated actors. Would absolutely loooooove to see them face off together in this.",
            "So I guess no Gyllenhaal and Hathaway. Doubt they would cast 4 such high profile actors for a single season of a show.",

            "Current rumor is that all Disney+ Marvel shows that were supposed to get a season 2...aren't anymore.\n\nThey will either get their own standalone films...or they will continue their storylines in other people's films.\n\nFor Moon Knight, either he gets his own movie or his story concludes in a Midnight Sons crossover film, a Blade film, etc.",

            "It was only supposed to be one season",
            "Oh well.",
            "I hope not. Despite him being a favorite character of mine, I despised the episodes I watched. It was painful & I stopped without finishing, which is uncommon for me.\n\nIsaac is too talented to be wasted on the flailing MCU nonsense they're cranking out. It's not like they're ever planning to actually do anything cool with the character anyway.",
            "Good, Beef getting a second season and Moon Knight not getting one is a step in the right direction for the industry.",
            "I had a dream it existed, but it was a secret release with a different title",
            "I'm pretty sure Moon Knight is going to be folded into the Midnight Sons project they're doing",
            "I agree. Not having it thematically tied to a cultural minority is going to make this season feel a bit forced to me. Should\u2019ve just stayed an limited series imo but I\u2019m interested in being proven wrong",
            "That\u2019s a really interesting theory",

            "This would break every streaming record ever. This would be so cool of Rock and would be such an epic comeback story for Will (especially if Jada plays his wife in the series, too).\n\nOne can only imagine!\n\nI'm going to ChatGPT right now to have them draft up a script just for my own personal curiosity and entertainment - lol.",
            "Wrong show. That's for Ryan Murphy's Feud.",
            "WOW DUDE",
            "It\u2019s ironic because last year, people were like \u201cBeef is the reason we need Asian American representation,\u201d but now Beef may not even have Asian leads anymore so that seems \u2026 like an interesting move. It kinda changes the way people talked about the show.",
            "It was also refreshing to see Asian leads in a show that didn\u2019t have a specific race driven plot. Almost like the show was written for anyone and season 1 legitimately used Asians and it was successful. For some reason that feels like a bigger win for Asians than the show just being about Asians.",
            "Other races can be bad drivers too.",
            "Got success from season 1 and ditched Asians and comedians and went for the big name stars. I can\u2019t see this having the same charm.",
            "Yeah that\u2019s weird because it\u2019s one of the main reason it got so talked about in the first place and the creator is of Asian descent and I would think that he would like to continue to make stories about Asian Americans.",
            "You are absolutely right. It's disappointing because we don't get a lot of Asian American representation while we already have so many white stories.",
            "Honestly, it is. Like, I don't doubt that it will be good, and this is great casting for a drama. Still, when I originally heard about the casting, I just thought \"oh, this is going to be totally unrelatable now.\" I also imagined someone at A24 saying, \"No, I am sorry, but you exhausted that topic in the last season.\"",
            "I don't really get the assumptions people have over it being pointless. If it's about entirely different people, it's essentially just a different show about people who have beef, made by the same people. It could be shit or it could be even better than the first season. It's not tacking on unnecessary plot lines for a show that should've been finished, it's a different thing",
            "I mean, so long as the characters from Season 1 are over and done with.\n\nThey could continue to make the series between 2 new characters with beef every year. There are a lot of different directions they could go with this each season to make them all feel very different.",
            "It doesn\u2019t and I feel like this casting misses part of the fun of the first season. Also a huge part of the first season was Asian representation. Seems weird to just drop that",
            "Treat it like Fargo or True Detective. It pivots to an anthology show and hopefully they put out a good product.",
            "It looks like they turned it into an anthology series so why not?",
            "I'm looking forward to the beef universe.",

            "Carey is a BAFTA Best Actress winner and is tied for 8th all-time most Best Actress nominations from the Academy Awards; that's quite a special class.   \n  \nAccording to Wikipedia:  \n>[Oscar Isaac] was named the best actor of his generation by Vanity Fair in 2017 [by the chief critic Richard Lawson] and one of the 25 greatest actors of the 21st century by The New York Times in 2020.  \n  \nI'm not sure underrated is the correct term; they are amongst the most highly regarded performers in the world. It will be super exciting to have them in *Beef*.",

            "I can't see them getting a theatrical film. If they aren't doing well enough to have a 2nd season on Disney+, then they will get absolutely slaughtered in a theatrical release. And Marvel doesn't want to have another embarassing bomb like The Marvels again.\n\nOut of the Disney+ shows the most successful ones were Wandavision and Loki both of which are over. I think it would be better if they focus their efforts on Daredevil which has proven to be a success on television rather than making another TV show that dilutes the brand further.",
            "The whole MCU ecosystem is so weird. movies and shows shouldn\u2019t be intertwined so much. Like if I go to a theater and watch a movie, I shouldn\u2019t have to be told I need to watch a whole 10 episode season of some show to understand what is going on.",

            "Honestly suprised how much Im getting downvoted for this. It was very refreshing to see realistic 30-40 year old asian american characters be the main cast of popular comedy-drama. Straight up the first time I ever seen a show like this that I could relate too as a Asian person from LA",
            "Charles Melton is rumored to be one of the leads. But yeah, going from a great tool for Asian representation that gave a seasoned actress like Ali Wong her (well-deserved) flowers to just yet another mostly white show with well-established actors, is disappointing.",
            "I get what you\u2019re saying but their race was heavily commented on and core aspects to their characters",

            "Guess I'm the dissenting voice here, but I loved the show for its premise and its lead actors. It was just notable for its Asian representation.\n\nNothing about the premise necessitates it being a vessel for minority representation; they were just telling an interesting story with that backdrop, which is what meaningful representation should be. \n\nAs long as this is what the creator wants to do to tell the story (which is what it sounds like), I don't think it's weird at all.",

            "I think the point was proven when portions of their audiences were lost on how Doctor Strange 2 fit with the rest of the films, realizing that a large part of the plot was involved in having to watch Wandavision first as a pre-requisite. And those were both previously established characters in theaters FIRST. Having the first Moon Knight standalone film, actually being a sequel to a show that *absolutely* has to be watched prior (unless the movie opens with a slavishly poor recap of the show before picking off) just doesn\u2019t work with large scale audiences.",
            "Truthfully, although it hasn't been officially announced, I think Marvel is going to end their Disney+ shows once this last batch is complete.\n\nBecause rumors for films keep growing...but rumors for new shows have practically disappeared.\n\nInternally, they are quietly killing their live-action shows.\n\nIf I had to guess, Marvel will pivot to animation for Disney+ and keep the MCU proper in theaters only.",

I think my brain is literally blocking them out because I don't recall them all being bad, but just can't think of anything specific that I enjoyed outside of Hawkeye & a big part of that enjoyment was due loving the character outside of MCU, loving Hailee, & loving the comic source they were adapting. I don't think it was especially high quality or anything.\n\nI think I stopped watching all Marvel shows & movies without even realizing it & have forgotten the ones I saw too.",

It felt refreshing in a similar way to Reservation Dogs where I don't feel like I'm being presented with the usual racial stereotypes.",
            "Seems like the creator sold out for a check.\n\n  \nCeline Song's next movie doesn't have any Asian people in it either. Obviously, creators of color aren't beholden to only cast people from their community. It's just a little jarring that they get all this acclaim and recognition for representation and once they do, they immediately run to the whitest cast imaginable. Jordan Peele or Barry Jenkins wouldn't be able to get away with something like that.",

            "The overarching narrative isn't about being Asian. It's told from an Asian American perspective that might involve rice cookers and gangsters, but ultimately the story is about two people really pissed off at each other.\n\nA movie like **Everything Everywhere All at Once** is an example of a family experience of Asian immigrants.\n\n**Crazy Rich Asians** is about, well, it's in the title.\n\nIt's very rare to find American media featuring a large Asian cast without the entire narrative or theme being about how they're different because they're Asian. Beef has a cast portrayed as normal Americans in LA.",
            "I feel like people are really downplaying how important the good Asian American representation was last season",

            "The characters being Asian affected the complexity/depth of the characters in a way that made them especially great in that context. Yes, I\u2019m sure the show could have been done well if the characters were not Asian, then it would be a much different show - things like the accuracy/specificity of Korean church culture would be changed and just a different show entirely.",

As someone who would love to write for Marvel someday (any division really), I still think a spiritual successor to AoS about SWORD (as introduced in WandaVision) could make for a good ongoing series. Take the less-explored parts of Marvel mythos and explore that whole side of things like AoS before it. But that's just one idea I think has potential.

Between AI and other advancements in technology the barrier to entry has been lowered substantially and democratization of the craft has proliferated.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why studios have to be involved at all? Will people just stop making art and content if it\u2019s not as lucrative? Maybe having more control and agency and a much larger slice of the pie would spur a renaissance of genuine, unique and creative shows?

Besides the fact he\u2019s not as good of an actor as Jensen, I think his behavior might have something to do with it. I work in film and the service industry in Austin, and I\u2019ve heard very mixed things about him. I know several people who have worked with him on set, and they\u2019ve said he\u2019s very professional and amicable. However, I also know several people who\u2019ve interacted with him while working in the service industry in Austin, and they\u2019ve all said negative things about him. That he\u2019s get drunk and belligerent, and he even was verbally abusive to someone I know, and tried to get them fired for a small mistake.

            "Let's be honest, here. Both actors have a group of obsessed fangirls convinced that \"their\" guy is an Oscar-worthy actor who is only not a mega A-list superstar because they loved Supernatural just that much. Jensen Ackles was a better actor than Jared Padalecki, but they were both pretty CW-caliber. Neither are in the same league as an Antony Starr.",
            "They think he\u2019s being forced to say yes to kripke because he embarrassed him and asked him publicly \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And after what they did to some of the cast because they were hanging out with jensen? I\u2019m not sure how jp will be received by the cast with his toxic fans! Plus he needs to step up with the quality of his acting because that show got a lot of talent",
            "All of this is just making him look desperate to join the cool kids table. It\u2019s been month of this boys chicken he and Kripke have been playing. Give him a line on the show to shut everyone up and call it a day. It\u2019s not like anyone is going to give him something like Solider Boy because he won\u2019t be willing to do the work to do something like that amazing, if he was Walker would have been better and not just a step\u00a0up from his Supernatural audition tapes. \u00a0",
            "> However, I also know several people who\u2019ve interacted with him while working in the service industry in Austin, and they\u2019ve all said negative things about him. That he\u2019s get drunk and belligerent, and he even was verbally abusive to someone I know, and tried to get them fired for a small mistake. \n\nThis is not surprising at all, he's gone on twitter multiple times to complain about his service somewhere (usually naming a server's name and one time even posting a picture of her IIRC) knowing full well his fanbase will lose it and go after them. And he was arrested for assaulting two of the employees at the bar he owned when he was drunk, so.",

            "he's great when he's got a good script to work with, like most decent actors. it's a rare talent for actors to still be good with a shit script, like Lance in that Resident Evil show. He made it work. He literally polished a turd.",
            "I agree with you 100%. He is not a good actor, at all, he wasn't a good actor in Supernatural.\n\nHis biggest problem is he doesn't know how to emote with his face, it's always this silly grimace with duck lips.",

Dean gets *all* the meaningful conversations and close relationships with the side characters. Sam gets squat. He gets villains, like Ruby and Lucifer, sex pests like Becky and even though I didn't mind Amelia all that much, I know the fandom apparently hated her.\n\nIt's a shame because I much prefer Sam to Dean. But I prefer practically every supporting character to both of them.",
            "To be fair, most of the scripts they all got in the later seasons were pretty awful. Some of the actors made do with them better than others though, despite the quality. By the end the brothers were pretty much sidelined from their own show.",

            "I really think they're all friends, but Jared's fans pitched a nonstop hate attack against the Winchesters since Jensen was supposed to narrate it without Jared, similar to Young Sheldon. The funny thing is they've flat out said Sam would have eventually appeared if the show continued. Then adding the fact that Jensen ended up being way more popular in general doesn't help.",

But I prefer practically every supporting character to both of them.\n\nWell both get sidelined in the end.",
            "I was a Sam girlie too. It\u2019s a shame because Sam feels like the main character when the show starts. He\u2019s the first character you\u2019re introduced to and he\u2019s kind of an audience surrogate because he wants the normal life. He\u2019s also the one causing conflict with their dad which helps keep the story going. \n\nAnd then the writers room got bored of him. Side characters all become Dean\u2019s friends, every trait about Sam gets given to Dean when it\u2019s convenient. Like Sam was supposed to be the nerdy one but when Charlie shows up, they decide to make Dean a nerd so that he and Charlie can become best friends. I\u2019m still annoyed about that choice. \n\nThere\u2019s like one funny line from Sam in like season 12 (I think) that stood out to me because I was like, \u201cOh they remembered Sam can be funny too.\u201d It made me sad because it reminded me how much personality he had at the beginning of the series.",
            "That is also partially \\*because\\* Jensen was a clearly better actor (and also unfortunately because the unhinged online fans would throw a fitshit if there were more than two consecutive scenes without Dean, Castiel, or both).",

            "> I couldn't get over that fake gruff voice he does, he barks all of his lines and it sounds ridiculous. \n\nThat's like... The entire point. It's been made into this false bravado of a personality",
            "Do you not understand the concept of acting? That's how SB is supposed to sound. Ackles is a far superior actor compared to Padahuffnpuff. No one said he's better than Antony or Karl or anyone else on the cast. Jensen had many scenes/episodes on SPN that were Emmy worthy. JP had none.",
            "Yeah, I see his political tweets sometimes",
            "Honestly I don\u2019t think Jensen and Jared are as close friends as they used to be anymore I think the prequel twitter shit really put a dent in what they were and since then they have been drifting further apart they haven\u2019t had a fun dynamic panel together at a convention since the show ended. I think they get along for the conventions and whatever might happen with the revival, but I bet it\u2019s hard to be friends with a guy who sicced his entire online fandom on you over not being told about a project that was leaked.\u00a0",
            "They be downright spooky sometimes.",
            "But it\u2019s funny because it was public that Jared was going to Walker immediately after Supernatural, and actors on the CW have talked about how crazy the schedules can be. Jared probably wanted to use his downtime.",
            "He is busy as a youtube influencer his stuff is adorable",
            "Didn\u2019t know that. Guess I was lucky to be surprised by it.",
            "Already cast.",
            "The man was straight up in Ukraine near the front lines a few weeks ago and has met with Biden and Obama (a few times I think). I've only seen him in Supernatural, so weird to see",
            "Yeah it seems like they're friends in that way where once you and a bestie seriously fight and make up you're friends again but you'll never really be close in the same way because the trust is gone but you have too much shared history to truly call off the friendship entirely.",
            "I can see that. I think they're all still friends in the way you frequently are after you worked with someone for a very long time. They don't seem anywhere near as close tbh, but they do appear to be cordial.",
            "I agree",
            "I never heard any of this. This is sad to hear. Is there anywhere I can get a rundown of all this",
            "If he's doing influencer things irl they could have him play a part/cameo as himself",
            "Got a link?",
            "Wow, now that's incredibly impressive work!",
            "Just search twitter for news articles about The Winchesters, and you'll see the same Jared stans posting over and over again for two solid years under each of them calling Jensen every name in the book, posting snake emojis, and saying he's a terrible actor. They've trashed The Boys as immature, violent junk ever since Ackles guest-starred and went after Jack and Laz on twitter. Some of them are now saying they can't wait for Jensen's new show so they can yell \"copaganda\" under every article, even though he's supposed to be a part of an international black ops task force. It's the same army of fans who attacked service workers every time Jared posted another social media meltdown against one, especially the couple of workers that he doxxed.",
            "That would be awesome. He could annoy Jared and Jensen.",
            "Do people really want to turn The Boys into this kind of self-referential guff? I love SPN as much as the next fan but I would hate it if there was just a Kripke wankfest in the middle of an episode of an unrelated project.",
            "wasnt padleckis most recent role being walker TEXAS RANGER. I didnt watch it but the norris texas ranger was the most copagnda show I can think of.",
            "Yes it\u2019s all there and they are still going",
            "I wouldn\u2019t put it past Kripke to have a literal SPN actor wankfest in the middle of an episode. Maybe even a circle jerk. Audience members would faint",
            "I personally don't care, but if there is the opportunity to do stuff like that just for fun why not?",
            "I mean if any show could pull that off it would be The Boys",
            "I agree 100%. I\u2019m a brand new viewer currently watching season 1 of The Boys right now.  I was psyched when I found out it\u2019s Kripke\u2019s show. Then 10 minutes later, I read that Jensen joined the show during season three. I know Jensen will do a great job, so yay! Now Jared? No thank you. I just don\u2019t think he has the acting range to pull it off. But to each their own.\n\nHowever, after watching 8 seasons of SPN I was done. The fans who adore the actors (not so much the show itself) are coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs. From my understanding, it only got worse after I stopped watching. SO. Been there, watched that social media shit show. It\u2019s a big hell no for me. I just hope he\u2019s only in one episode.",
            "Yes, it sure was. Irony is dead.",

        "content": "As a man in my early 40s, it was the hottest thing on TV when I was a teenager. But I never watched it because the movie it was based on was pretty bad and it looked like some teeny-bopper sci-fi show.\n\nMy wife loved the show and we decided to watch an episode a night in bed. The first season is a slog and exactly what I expected the show to be, Dollar General X-Files...until we got to the Season 1 finale, which was incredible. Season 2 was more fun and then we got to the season 2 finale which was incredible. ETC.\n\nThe set-up/payoff is probably better than any show I've ever seen. (Miles to go, little miss muffet counting down from 7-3-0)\n\nAnd then we got to episodes like, \"Hush\", \"Restless\", \"The Body\", \"Once More With Feeling\", and \"Conversations with Dead People\".\n\nThat show is so much more than it's goofy title and a monster-of-the-week. I feel like they said, \"what if we combine 'All My Children' with the moral complexity of Kurt Vonnegut combined with the horror of, 'The Twilight Zone' and use it to heavily explore depression, feminism, and what makes a life meaningful\".\n\nAnyway! Great show! The first season really sucks! Just watch \"Prophecy Girl\" and skip to season 2. You'll pick up the missing pieces.",

            "Spike's scene entrances and exits were some of the best comedy bits put to tv, imo",
            "i get so happy seeing people discovering this show even decades later!\n\na truly incredible piece of television.",
            "A little internet history for the younger people. Buffy was the first ever show to get captured and released to the internet for download on a weekly basis. Angel was the 2nd.\n\nAfter the Columbine shooting, the WB pulled the episode Earshot before it aired because it coincidentally revolved around a school shooting. A guy who had access to the wild feed (which is how a network sent its shows to all their affiliates back then) captured the feed and sent a copy to the group who were releasing the episodes weekly. They then released it as they always did and it blew up like crazy.",
            "As a man in his mid 30s, this is my all time favorite show.",
            "I enjoy the first season for what it is. It introduces the characters and you immediately get attached to them; and the MOTW stories are kinda fun in its own way, even if a bit dated from the perspective of 2024. I'd also say that it's far more fulfilling to watch it from the beginning, because you have the full scope of where the characters started and where they end up.",
            "BtVS has saved my life, a lot. As a relatively flamboyant gay kid stuck in the closet, I grew up being made fun of all the time. At one point I was forced to go to a real crappy school where I started getting beaten up and feeling suicidal, and then the show aired, I got hooked and Buffy became my hero. Every Monday (then Tuesday) was a big event -- my favorite night of the week and something to look forward to -- and after each episode I'd go outside to pretend to \"train\", slay vampires and the forces of darkness, and save the world. It was so much fun tumbling around, having entire action sequences play out through my mind in the process, punch by punch, kick after kick, getting to a point where I'd been close to being beaten, but always found the strength within myself to get back up and beat the bad guy. \n\n\nEventually I got to a point where I could do back hand springs and back flips, round house kicks and handstands that I could hold for up to a minute. I could flip up from off the ground and go for hours. Sure my neighbors thought I was crazy but I didn't care, I was having the time of my life inadvertently blowing off steam and reducing them cortisol levels, and getting to feel better about myself and who I was; I could relate to how the characters were outcasts but at the same time so ... normal. In the process it instilled a lot of confidence in me, and between Buffy's quips and her sense of style and mimicking that I grew into my own and got to talking back to all those meanies to where I finally got to be accepted for who I was and blend in. Between LGBT representation on the show and in other forms of media I finally found the courage to come out my senior year, when one day in class we were debating whether homosexuality was the result of nature vs nurture, with most arguing the latter. I raised my hand and simply said I'd known I was gay since I was seven years old, to indicate what that might say about things.\n\n\nNowadays I'm ten years into struggling with an addiction to chemsex, and my doc is meth, so it's a mess and one of the hardest addictions to try and manage. In all that time I've been fighting for recovery, without much progress. I believe it stems from and is perpetuated by my eco-anxiety, in regards to climate change and the rest, and the state of the world. Long gone are the days when sleeping around and violating my morals was an unusual occurrence, at this point behaviors that have been reinforced to becoming default once I'm under the influence ... Something like how I believe Buffy seemed to feel in her relationship with Spike. Speaking of which, I used to hate season 6 but now it's my favorite one, given how relatable it is, and how it seemed like I got to watch new episodes of the show as if they had created another season, having all but blocked it from my memory after it aired having been so disappointed in what became of the show when it left the WB.\n\n\nBut there's something about my history, what's happening, and what the show did for me. I know who I am, what I want, and my worth. Recovery teaches you life skills and coping techniques like that. Whereas I once felt hopeless and helpless about where we're headed as a species, I recently experienced a breakthrough while thinking about all the big picture stuff. Reality can be mind-boggling as it is, but realizing you're *actually* sandwiched in-between billions of years of time has a way of putting things into perspective. So at this point it feels once again like people's petty judgements are less of a concern than what matters in life ... Which is to try and live aligned with my values and stand up for what's right, fighting the true, real life forces of darkness in order to save the world ... With that said, I've always been creative, and I don't know if it's from the physicality I adopted from my idolization of Buffy as a character, but as it happens, even at 36 years old, I move and groove like a superhero (and this is outside of addiction ... The longer I'm clean the more like a meth head I seem ... I'm a firecracker like that); I've got boundless natural energy and am  always high spirited, as if I'm at a point that I've been able to face my demons and am capable of & in the process of facing the world's; I think there's a lot of power that comes with those types of abilities , and our intelligence as humans, combined with whatever talents we possess, and perhaps comes with some form of responsibility for those of us that know what we know, that have that spirit within us. In this way I suspect the show continues to play a part in keeping me strong and looking forward, despite those struggles (And no, I'm not obsessed & never watch it anymore, nor do I play pretend, sadly, but excuse me while I now go reinitiate doing both and have some fun \ud83d\ude01)\n\n\n\"The hardest thing in this world is to live in it. Be brave. Live, for me.\" - Buffy Summers",
            "Hush is incredible and hilarious. \n\nMy favourite though is \n\nSpike: Randy Giles? Why not just call me Horny Giles or Desperate-For-A-Shag Giles? I knew there was a reason I hated you.",
            "I had a very similar experience with the first season as you. I didn\u2019t dislike it as much as you did, but it was mostly at best a weak \u201cfine\u201d that I was just watching for the sake of watching something.\n\nThe finale is where the show hooked me and I\u2019m pretty sure I can pin it down to the exact moment I knew it had me, which there aren\u2019t many shows I can still remember that for.",
            "Season 2 finale of Buffy is, IMO, still the most heart wrenching season finale of any TV show ever.",
            "Yep, the 90s really had the great shows that stand out! I really liked how Buffy did serializtion too, maybe 7-10 big seasonal plot episodes, the rest are small disconnected stories, wish more shows did it like that too. Allows to put charcters in different situations and play with form a lot, and not to be stuck in their tracks (Xander's episode where he defeats 3 zombies IMO shows that big picture of characters doing same old same old).\n\nHave similar sentiment regarding another 90s show ahead of its time Babylon 5 - it did throughout preplanned serializtion that modern shows rarely do.",
            "I take offense to referring to the OG movie as \"bad.\" The movie was high camp awesome.\n\nThe series was low camp awesome. \n\nDifferent, but still good.",

            "Ridiculous slander about season 1. Great season.",

            "Cheesy as it was, the episode with the computer demon was shockingly prophetic.",
            "honestly one of the best shows ever!",
            "I haven\u2019t watched Buffy since it originally aired and I\u2019ve just found out it\u2019s on Disney +. \n\n\nThat\u2019s my weekend sorted!",
            "Also try Veronica Mars.",
            "Bunch of youngsters here.\nI'm 58 and feel like doing a rewatch.\nToo bad I have most of the seasons memorized.\nIt should be noted it's greatness was eventually recognized and is considered one of the greatest shows of all time. Maybe not top 10, but right up there.",
            "I went to college late, so in 2018 I was just finishing up and one of the classes I took was \"Vampires in media\". The first thing our professor did was ask what our favorite vampire tv shows/movies/books were and all the 18-21ish yr olds in the class were all agreed that Buffy was amazing and a must watch. Some of the kids had never heard of it and all the other kids were like, omg go home and watch it tonight! Its amazing! Our professor also assigned a few episodes for us to watch and by the end of the semester there was a class full of Buffy nerds.\n\nThat whole class and the professor were amazing. I wish I could retake that class.",

            "I had shows that I liked to watch at 8 and 10 but I had an hour to kill in between. I ended up watching season 5 of Angel. This led me to start watching Buffy and Angel and I'm so glad I did. Such a great mix of comedy, action, drama, and character work. Easily a top 10 show of all time for me.",
            "My love for Buffy the Vampire Slayer is only exceeded by my love for Angel.",
            "My favourite episodes are the Halloween ones.",
            "Hell yeah now it\u2019s time to watch Angel which imo is even better",
            "I'm so happy for you to discover this show, random stranger in my demographic.\n\nI love all the widely beloved episodes you mention, but one of my favorites that is mentioned less is The Zeppo. It's the only episode of the show that I'll just sit down and watch on its own occasionally.",
            "I believe it was mentioned by Whedon that he wanted the show to reflect real angsty teenagers, but with demons and monsters. The difficulty growing up with a burden on your shoulders, and the friends that back you up and help carry you to become the best person (slayer) you are.  \n\nI watched it faithfully from season one at 18 yrs old until it ended. I will re-watch it on occasion. And now you've made me want to do another re-watch. :)",
            "Movie was awesome.",
            "I just started it for the first time recently and loving it so far. I\u2019m about halfway through season 4 now",
            "r/buffy would be happy to hear this :)",
            "Still my favorite show of all time. There is nothing else quite like it. Every time I start a rewatch and go back to the Sunnydale High library, it feels like going home to see old friends. I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it so much!\u00a0",
            "I loved it when it aired, but it never occurred to me to rewatch it. The episode where Buffy deals with a death in the family was my favourite. Her stunned unbelieving reaction was so similar to my own under similar circumstances. I\u2019d never seen the shock of the news of a loved one\u2019s death portrayed so accurately on screen. \n \nThe numb unreal feeling that envelops you as your life and your future and all your expectations and assumptions just get completely rewritten in a single terrible moment.  Absolutely brilliant episode. Maybe it\u2019s time to start a rewatch.",
            "Seasons 2 and 3 are terrific with great finales. And then there are great special episodes that you mention that are remarkable. \n\nWitty dialogue, neat situations, great character building. If released today, i think it would be very popular.\n\nI'm waiting a couple years to rewatch it with my teenage daughter. I've seen a few favorite episodes,  but want to experience it again.",
            "Welcome to the fandom! (obligatory fuck you, Joss Whedon though)\n\nI was a new teacher when the show started. I also was also much closer in age to the kids than I was the teachers!\n\nI thought the first season had some really brilliant episodes, and overall the student drama rang so true, especially the one with the hyena pack. One of my favorite episodes of the show, of all the seasons!",
            "I just watched it for the first time last year when I was 21. Amazing show, immediately went into my top 10 favorite shows list (I have watched 250+ shows so top 10 is really good)",
            "I remember watching it and Angel when it aired. They went off the air then Supernatural filled that network TV occult Buffy shaped hole for me.\n\nIt feels very character action like the old Xena and Hercules TV shows but modern day and with a lot more going on with its characters.",
            "I only know of one episode from this show and that\u2019s \u2019the body\u2019 though I don\u2019t know any of the characters in depth I can fully appreciate how incredibly well done that episode is, with how realistic and sudden jt is.",
            "Watch Angel too, and read the graphic novels for both Angel and Buffy. \n\nFringe is also well written, and from that time period there\u2019s also Eureka \n\nMore entertaining and violent/comedy vampire films, Renfield and Abigail",
            "The first season is a grind but it\u2019s still worth watching for the lore (and Campy goodness)",
            ">the movie it was based on was pretty bad\n\nOh man, wrong. When's the last time you watched the movie?",
            "For context season 1 was greenlit midseason because of another show cancellation that means rushing production and writing as well as making do with shoestrings. That's why season one is how itis (also because a show needs to find its footing) but also why it is shorter than the other seasons.",
            "I love that you called out Conversations With Dead People. That episode is a fucking masterpiece and doesn't get mentioned nearly enough.",
            "Best show of all time.",
            "I've watched this show more times than I can count. I want to get my kids into it.",
            "Gotta watch angel next",
            "Are you watching Angel at the same time?",
            "Congrats on making the same exact discovery I made 20 years ago (I\u2019m 38 and all I knew at the time was SMG being top tier hottie) right as it was ending lol. FX had started running summer reruns from the beginning. Now do yourself a favor and watch ANGEL.  Also I\u2019ve really come to love season 1 for what it was, but no doubt prophecy girl came out of nowhere like a knockout punch and really sold me.",
            "As a gay man in his early 30s, i agree",
            "Buffy is cool, watch Angel and Charmed afterwards. Also iconic tv shows.",
            "Season one you need a bit more. Watch the double intro, Angel and then Prophecy Girl. I usually throw in Nightmares too, just because I like it.",
            "good for you - it's such a great show",
            "I\u2019ve never rewatched Buffy. But always held it to be my first favourite TV series ever!\n\nThere were other great show shows around the same time. But Buffy gets first place in my heart.\n\nX-Files, Charmed, The West Wing, Gilmore Girls, West Wing, Friends (duh), Dawson\u2019s Creek, Angel (of course). Not all were great all the way through, or had strong finishes like Buffy. Good times though omg!",
            "Watch Angle when you get to the season they started that spin off. I think he mastered at the sonic storytelling at that point. It was like every three issues was finale worthy.",
            "The episodes with Faith were boring as a cloudy day",
            "Loved BTVS especially Buffy",
            "I loved the character development of spike. He had it all.",
            "Season six falls off really hard, though it has the best musical episode of any show, and sevens not great. But yes on the whole Buffy is an amazing and incredibly influential show. A lot of series tried to follow in its footsteps but none really lived up to it.  \n\nWillow and Tara will also always have an incredibly important place in my heart as well.",
            "I also watched BtVS as an adult, and I have watched all except the last season. Because I loved it so much I didn\u2019t want it to end\u2026 so it hasn\u2019t for me!!",
            "Hush is still one of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.",
            "Buffy is great. I recommend it to people looking for something new to watch all the time and they are usually incredulous. One of my all time favorite series.",
            "Now watch Angel, which is much better in my opinion.",
            "Loved Buffy up until that ending, actually pissed me off tbh",
            "I agree that season 1 is a chore to get through.  Some of the writing is just really bad.  The last season with emo buffy was also not great and the ending absolutely sucked lol.  But the rest was good.  Once more with feeling is one of the only musical episodes in tv that actually worked pretty well.",
            "How age appropriate is it?\n\nI have an 8 and an 12 year old. Can they watch if?",
            "I\u2019m in my early 40\u2019s as well, and my wife is younger than me but seems to only watch Buffy & Charmed (it\u2019s ok, I only watch Star Trek). I was familiar with them when I was younger because\u2026\u2026well because I was in love with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyssa Milano\u2026.but they\u2019re good. Buffy is better overall, but Charmed is consistent and I\u2019ve been in love with Alyssa Milano since Who\u2019s The Boss.",
            "I remember liking the movie but never really caught on with the series. \n\nI think I need to go back and give it a second chance.",

            "Wanna know how actually great this show is? \n\nSPOILERS: When Spike originally comes into town, he hits the \u201cWelcome to Sunndydale\u201d sign with his car. When he comes back after his breakup with Drusilla, he hits the \u201cWelcome to Sunnydale\u201d sign with his car.  In the finale, when they finally destroy the Hellmouth once and for all, you see the \u201cWelcome to Sunnydale\u201d sign fall into the crater that was made by, you guessed it, Spike.  Such a fucking good bit.",
            "Spike being soooo happy about his morning cup of blood in Hush lives rent free in my head.",
            "Him running into the house during the day, under his coat and pulling it off with a huge billow of smoke cracks me up.",
            "I vaguely remember Buffy being on TV when I was a little kid. I only ever caught the last few minutes but I remember thinking she looked badass.\n\nI'm on my first watch through now, and I've just reached the point where I'm watching Angel as well. I'm loving them so far!",
            "I just made a post about how I took a class back in 2018 and most the kids in the class knew and loved the show and the ones who didn't were encouraged to watch it. By the end of the semester we had a class full of fans. \n\nIt still seems popular.",
            "I think I'm gonna dive into it soon, I've never seen a single episode but I'm a huge fan of weird, cult classics. Love X-Files, and Twin Peaks is my all time favorite.",
            "I feel the same way! brings me joy when people discover a show I love. I'm the same way with Supernatural, too. :)",
            "Yeah they didn't air the episode until right before the season 4 premiere.",
            "As a different man in his mid 30s, agreed! I watched it live starting in Season 4, I got the DVDs when I went to college, and I have watched it (and Angel) through *so* many times. One of my ultimate comfort shows, even if it's rarely comfortable.",
            "It has some really really really bad episode (the puppet one, sorry, I know even it has fans). But the arc episodes are not too bad. Both the pilot and especially the finale are great (and we could make an argument for skipping everything else). The Angel episode falls flat because of the acting, but it's an ok setup for things to come. I must be the only one who enjoyed \"never kill a boy on the first date\" and \"the pack\". The witch episode introduces a character that will be way more important later I guess (though with a completely different morality). The rest of the season can be safely ignored, but at least some of them are fun monster of the week stories.",
            "I enjoy it as well. The characters are really fun, even though there aren\u2019t any truly \"great\" episodes (the first of those being \"Halloween\" in S2), and the goofy campiness has its own charm. I don\u2019t blame anyone for bouncing off of it though!\u00a0",

            "That final sequence at the end of the season finale still makes me eyes moist. Especially with the Sarah McLachlan in the background.",
            "\"Close your eyes\"",
            "What's great about though is that even in episodes that are more monster-of-the-week stand-alones, the monster or problem they're facing is usually thematically appropriate to what's going on in the main characters' lives at that point in the season, so they often still feel like they're still progressing or at least enriching the ongoing arcs.",
            "The problem with the movie as far as I understand is that it had fuck all to do with the script Whedon had actually written. Hence why he developed the series as a continuation to that unused script rather than to the movie that actually got made.",
            "That was probably a low-blow considering Donald Sutherland just died. \n\nIt was a fun popcorn movie. The show goes well beyond that.",

            "Angel is similar where season 1 is a huge miss but season 2 to the end is amazing",
            "Agreed, Buffy is great but Angel just has better, well, everything.\n\nI'll agree with some that season 4 was the weakest by far but I personally loved season 1 once Wesley arrived.\n\nOP, you should def give it a chance, but be prepared for a different overall mood and speed, it starts off very 'Angel'-like in that it's broody, quiet and lonely in feel.",
            "For me it was significantly worse.  I kind of tuned out of a lot of episodes and was less interested overall.  Great finale though.\n\nCheers",

            "The group who was releasing the episodes was called #Buffy-Unlimited. They were on IRC on the efnet server. They were distributing it though FTP servers, usenet and I think IRC file servers at the time.\n\nWhen they released Earshot, the channel had over 5000 users, which was almost unheard of back then.

It felt so connected to the city and the dark of it all. Season 2 of Angel is my favorite season, and there\u2019s no doubt that the episodes and storytelling were better after season 1 with all the other seasons, but they also definitely shifted to more of a traditional TV format setting with the Hyperion and Wolfram and Hart\u2019s office. Season 1 just had this unique raw feel to it with being set in Angel\u2019s apartment/office and then just being out in the city, not quite knowing the extent of W&H, etc",

I think some people hate on Seasons 6-7, but I enjoyed them. If I had to make a list of most satisfying series conclusions this show would be on that list right next to Battlestar Galactica and Six Feet Under. Even more so when I think about the other show that I loved this much that dropped the ball with the finale/final season(Game of Thrones \ud83d\udc40). \n\nSide note: having to explain what a floppy disk/disk drive is, and why it\u2019s the \u201csave\u201d symbol on a computer, makes me feel so very ancient. \ud83d\ude2d",

The ensemble cast was so deep that ANGEL\u2019s future season one entire cast was supporting on season 3 plus Faith and Wilkins, even Spike came back for a brilliant one-off in Lover\u2019s Walk, the characters were so strong, Oz was maximized (love Tara, but that was a loss when he left, there was just an extra zip he added), there just wasn\u2019t a weak link anywhere.  \n\nThe drama and humor were so perfectly balanced even in an episode like Gingerbread, otherwise a filler episode, still had The Mayor in it, explored Willow as a character from the drama end, and yet still had stuff like Buffy accidentally staking the monster asking did I get it? and Oz deadpanning with \u201cjust so we\u2019re clear, you guys know you\u2019re nuts right?\u201d,  Xander/Oz falling through the ceiling - \u201cwe\u2019re here to rescue you\u201d, it was all just pitch perfect that year. \n\n\nBut you can definitely argue that season two\u2019s peaks were higher and more memorable especially because it was the first time the show was setting those unexpected highs.",

If it was flipped around to be Left wing character, a good portion of the younger generations would love it, for like a month, while the rest would just hate the character. Personally I think she is just annoying how unlikable she is. She feels like she is artificially a respected character in the show, meaning everyone in the story gives her her way or respects her for... reasons?

        "content": "Hallo all!\n\nFirst of all, I loved S1. I think it was a very innovative idea and tv show overall, different than Lost and other mystery shows. Overall, I could put 9/10 S1 as there was always something happening making you want to binge it so bad. I even remember not wanting to watch this show at night as every episode some new stuff came up and was always so scared.\n\nBut\u2026 what the heck happened with Season 2 though?\n\nYou can really tell the decline in quality. First of all, what happened so far in S2 is, Travis gets lost and they go out to find him, Shauna\u2019s baby shower and baby theme, Lottie\u2019s stupid rituals, search for food, meanwhile in the adult world, Nat gets to know Lottie\u2019s spiritual space (which no longer is a mystery), Tai\u2019s sleepwalking, the Shauna murder case which the police want to know more so they get to know her daughter and Misty wanting to find out where Nat was taken to when we all know where she was taken so nothing intriguing/interesting about it.\n\nHonestly, of all the things I\u2019ve said, Literally the only interesting stuff is Tai\u2019s sleepwalking case and the eyeless man and the symbol. But they develop these themes every 3 eps tbh except w tai\u2019s sleepwalking. They keep shoving uninteresting stuff. Like after ep3 and 4, its costing me to press the watch button on this show.\n\nNothing really exciting is happening and the same stuff happens on the cabin that really gets you nowhere. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen in this subreddit that this tv show was way better than Lost but imo, Lost always had something exciting to look forward to in every episode, even after S5-S6, it still had something.\n\nand this isnt from someone who just wants action. I\u2019ve seen Succession before hich has lots of dialogues and not much action.\n\nHonestly, 1/10 so bad",

            "There's a lot I still like about the show. The atmosphere, acting, music, and so much else is still fantastic. \n\nBut holy shit the writing took a nosedive.",
            "I think this show made a mistake of getting too deep in to the occult aspects of the crash site. It feels too much like Lost when it should be more like Lord of the Flies, with cannibalism.\n\nWe should see more of their high school life than their present day life. The conflicts and interpersonal relationships the team had in school, impacting what happened at the crash site was more interesting than \"spookiness is happening\", in my opinion.",
            "The show really needs to decide if it\u2019s supernatural or not. It\u2019s trying to do the lost thing of making it kind of vague, but the problem is that they\u2019ve already \u201cspoiled\u201d the ending. They go crazy and eat one another. We even know who survives. So if nothing supernatural happened, then why are we watching? \n\nThey keep actively taking interesting things off the board. They\u2019ve basically confirmed that that they didn\u2019t meet \u201cothers.\u201d Shauna\u2019s baby died and wasn\u2019t significant. Lottie isn\u2019t evil/an antagonist. \n\nThey say they have a five season plan, but for what? Are we really going to watch them starve and slowly descend into cannibalism for three more seasons when there isn\u2019t even the drama of wondering who will make it out? They need something to drive the plot forward and so far they\u2019ve taken every effort to kill off intriguing plot threads",
            "The biggest problem was that Juliette Lewis wanted off the show, so the adult storyline went through an overhaul to accommodate her. I don't know what the original plan was for adult world, but it was not what we ended up with.\n\nThe thing I blame writers for is showing all the adult survivors. We lost all the tension in the kid world because now they all have plot armor since we know they survive.\n\nI'll still watch, but my expectations are lower",
            "Yeah I loved s1, it quickly became one my favorite new shows. S2 was shockingly bad, though. All hype is now gone.",
            "The finale of season 2 is like irredeemably bad.",
            "Agree. Me and my friends really liked season 1. We watched S2 week to week last year and it was during the Caligula sequence we finally accepted that whoever wrote Season 1 seemed to have been obliterated from existence \n\nThat S2 finale is one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever seen filmed and put on TV.",
            "While I still follow it, that season is still jarring for me because the modern day storyline feels way too goofy in contrast to the 1996 story, and I do feel the absence of Ella Purnell since she really was one of the best actors in the show imo",
            "I loved season 1. I knew going in to season 2 that it wouldn't have the same quality as the first season and I was still so disappointed by it.\n\nThe adult storylines are so boring. I didn't care at all about Lottie's cult or Natalie helping that young girl. The season 2 finale had some of the most asinine wrap ups, that I can't imagine how the writers thought, \"Yeah, this works.\" \n\nNothing against Elijah Wood...but the character of Walter is a pain. Misty did not need a male counterpart. Misty was the wild card of the show, she should be the only wild card, introducing a male version of her just takes away from her character. \n\nAnother thing that frustrated me was the episode about Shauna giving birth in the Wilderness. This should have been a standout episode and they should have dedicated the entire episode to the Wilderness, because every time it cut back to the adult timeline the story lines they had going in that episode were dreadful. I think one involved Natalie saving a fish and Misty gossiping with some of the cult members at the compound. OMG, so terrible.",
            "I bailed near the very end of s1. It quickly started to feel like the writers were surprised people were interested and then started scrambling to extend the story.\n\nThe kids in the downed plane were the only interesting storyline.",

            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll recover from season 2, it was an absolute chore to watch. And the ridiculously long time in between seasons will only make the situation worse.",
            "The show has a really interesting concept but does not have the juice in it to be a long running show. After i finished season 1 i had read that they planned for the show to have 5 seasons and the second i knew that, i knew the show would go downhill. There just is not enough meat here to make this go on for that long without making it become utterly ridiculous. It doesnt help that all the interesting parts of the show are from them as teens in the mountains but they don't seem to know what to do with the adult counterparts.",
            "The show moves way too slow for it to be worth watching. It's been 3 years since the show started. Who wants to wait another 3 to see the mystery finally unfold?",
            "100% agree. S1 was great. Loved the drama, very much enjoyed the (hopefully) supernatural story plots. Then, S2 happened and undid a lot of what i was hoping for out of a lot of the stories, killed off an incredible character, and got so far up their own asses. It felt like the second season of Westworld where the writers seemed more concerned with looking smart than telling an enjoyable story with forward momentum. Just a bunch of wheel spinning. And, I understand that most of what they experienced in the woods is likely going to turn out to be some clear statement (or metaphor) for shared trauma, but I don\u2019t have to like it. This show is such a great opportunity to tell both a cool story of the things women are capable of while weaving the supernatural stuff in and that\u2019s likely not going to happen. Season three needs to come out SWINGING and not stop or people won\u2019t come back and the show, at most, will see a season four. I\u2019ve read the plan is five seasons, but no way they get there if season three doesn\u2019t get back to the basics of season one.",
            "I enjoyed season 1. Season 2 felt like a chore. I was dreading pressing the play button. It felt like something to do, not something to enjoy. I quit on episode 3. The storylines no longer felt grounded. They went for melodrama and the young girls seemed more interesting than their older counterparts. They felt more fleshed out and the actresses felt more in control of their characters. Sophie Thatcher seemed so much more interesting than Juliette Lewis. The first season felt interesting because there was an effort to connect the storylines, but not on season 2. I stopped. That's why it felt weird to see it nominated for best drama. The show dropped in quality quite a lot",
            "I also really enjoyed the first season and felt checked out during the second, especially with the finale.\n\nIt feels like they were just making it up as they went and it just isn't living up to how it started.",
            "I was so disappointed, loved the firs season but only made it through the first five episodes of season 2, won't be finishing it.",
            "There's a scene where someone disconnects Lewis's Porsche battery but then she's able to drive it.",
            "With Westworld, at least it's clean and simple. You can just watch the first season and you're done. It's self-contained and you can stop right there and have a full story. \n\nBut with Yellowjackets, they seemingly stopped season one like 90% of the way through a self-contained story. So the first two episodes of season two are pretty good, and complete that self-contained story. In fact, you will definitely find people arguing that S2E2 is the best episode of the show.\n\nThen it *immediately* jumps right off a cliff and never comes back. \n\nSeason two had one of the worst finales I recall seeing. I haven't laughed that hard at something trying to be serious since the last episode of Dexter. I don't even know how they can come back from that. \n\nAlso (spoilers for season two) as soon as they started introducing more people in the cabin I immediately realized nothing is going to happen to any of the people we know and care about. And then they proceeded to confirm that nearly every single named character in the past from season one is still alive. \n\nSo who gives a shit? The whole mystery was \"which one of these girls is going to get hunted, who isn't going to survive?\" But now it's pretty apparent the answer is...Random New Girl #4 is going to get hunted. What a satisfying conclusion to the mystery.",
            "I think this show is like Ted Lasso for me. I watched it at a weird point in my life and loved it then watched the second season mad at my self liking the show.",
            "They went full smoke monster in season 2.\n\nThere were parts of Lost to copy and parts to not.  Season 3 is so gonna have a guy living in a bunker.",
            "All the bad stuff can be forgiven because we have Jeff rocking out to Papa Roach",
            "glad I stopped after s1!",
            "I was basically foaming at the mouth over season 1. I was telling everyone they needed to watch it because it was so good. But S2... YIKES. \n\nWhile I won't say it's 1/10 bad, the direction they're going with really lost me. The Lottie storyline feels weird. Like, it is adding a fantasy/mystical/magical element that doesn't fit.",
            "It got \u201cShowtimed\u201d. They could have an all time 2 to 3 season show, but when a network that is struggling like showtime is feels like they have to maximize it and make it 5 seasons, it got watered down immediately. See Billions, Homeland, Weeds, Shameless. They don\u2019t know how to put a finish line constraint on shows. You could see that they were going to do this before season 1 was even finished.",
            "I guess I don't understand the severity of the reactions here. \n\nIt had a sophomore slump, like tons of other shows. Nothing it can't bounce back from.",
            "Everyone here should read the book \"Burn It Down\" by Maureen Ryan. \n\nYou'd be amazed how many shows, at the first sign of being a success, almost immediately replace their writing staff and showrunners in backroom handshake deals while producers start forcing new narratives that will play out better in foreign markets.\n\nAnother awful fact is that as soon as a project is greenlit the company is already planning to cancel it after season 2 or season 3 at the latest (unless it's made entirely in-house).",
            "The Frodo character was a bad decision. I can\u2019t think of a less-welcome inclusion of a great performance.",
            "Unpopular opinion, I was actually okay with most of S2. I don't like how they abandoned some of the threads from S1, and the last couple episodes of the season were truly awful, but I thought most of the season was fine.\n\nThat said, I have no faith in S3 and beyond. I think this probably gets canceled or ends a season or two earlier than they wanted.",
            "I didn't watch it, because Showtime has let me down so many times before. \n\nThey have such amazing first seasons of shows, and then they basically tank.  Like, I don't know if they expect the shows to do well, and they only create a strong good first season and let all the writers go or something?",
            "This is discouraging to hear. The first season is on my watchlist. Is S1 a completed story, or does it end unresolved?",
            "I liked Season 2, but I agree it was noticeably sub-par compared to Season 1.\u00a0 Fingers crossed it's just a Friday Night Lights situation, and it's upwards from here.",
            "To each their own, I loved Season 1 but Season 2 was amazing. I don't get all the hate at all. Still waiting for the 10th episode aka the bonus episode from season 2\ud83d\udc4d",
            "This show should of just went all in on Actually having supernatural and occult things be real.  The second season made is very obvious that all of that was easily explained away by an unreliable narrator effect and that the show was just a trauma dump circle jerk.  Boring.",
            "The season finale was terrible, I\u2019m still disappointed. I\u2019ll watch season 3 but I don\u2019t have high expectations.",

            "S2 is the worst follow up to a solid first season since Heroes?",
            "They split everyone up and it broke the tension but let\u2019s be honest if they would have spent more time with Christina ricci and her true crime boyfriend it would have been way more fun.",
            "It\u2019s fucking terrible.",
            "I don't think I have ever seen a show tank as fast as Yellowjackets did between seasons. It is truly shocking.\n\nIt's like Showtime is so dumb that some executive there said \"that's it! We have a hit! Fire all the writers! You don't need writers for a show that's already successfully.\"\n\nTruly, whatever happened here, it should be studied in television screenwriting textbooks for a generation.\n\nI really can't think of anything like this.",
            "My problem with S2 is that the adults made so many decisions that I find it impossible to believe someone would make in real life. \n\nLike >!as you said, all the ritual stuff, and how it culminated into the hunt at the end. Just... Why?!<",
            "The supernatural elements seem to have more or less fizzled out into nothing.  So now I guess the big secret they are trying to hide is just the cannibalism?  \n\nLong theory you can skip if you don\u2019t care:  After Jackie died at the end if S1, I thought maybe I had a sense of what direction the show was going.  In the first episode we see someone wearing Jackie\u2019s necklace get led into a death pit, so her dying of a totally unrelated cause got my attention, and I thought maybe we were heading towards something where the forest was returning the dead back to us, which would explain how previously assumed dead characters showed back up at the cabin. It could explain why they were trying to trap the assumed-Jackie in the opening scene; they knew it wasn\u2019t her. The big reveal would be all the adult characters that managed to escape the forest weren\u2019t the original versions of themselves either.  But nah.",

The issue is, after the big 'reveal' of season 1, they felt the need to keep similar focus on the adults, when their storyline no longer actually ties into the teenager storyline.

That\u2019s just one narrative thread, too - the journalist/private investigator plot also ends without anything coming of it.

Season one probably should have only focused on Shauna in the present timeline, with one of the other girls coming into the story around the midway point (probably Misty for entertainment purposes). This would have allowed them to keep things much more focused instead of having 8 principle characters to follow (really 9 in the first season with Jackie, and now 10 in season 2 with both versions of Van). The writing is going in circles because they have too much to juggle, so everything\u2019s unfocused.

There are three extras when they start their first hunt, but those girls disappear the following episode in the immediate aftermath.",

            "Very curious to see how they handle going to New Vegas in the next season. I know when the episode aired a lot of folks were under the impression that New Vegas looked like it was almost destroyed or falling apart or something. But I mean... have you played the game? The city *is* falling apart. The 3 main casinos (Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe and The Tops) are in good shape, but Gomorrah and even The Tops have damage on their exteriors and Gomorrah is also a bit damaged in its interior as well. There's rubble walls dividing sections of New Vegas (though this was for optimisation purposes, it's still there in game) and the surrounding areas of Freeside, Westside and Camp McCarran are also dilapidated. \n\nNo doubt that they'll canonize the House ending of New Vegas in some way since that's the only reason Lucy's dad could reasonably be going there. It's also likely that there won't be a strong NCR presence after Shady Sands was decimated, so maybe there could be members of Caesar's Legion running amok. We see some destroyed Securitrons in the outro concept art but apparently that's not to be taken as an indication of anything that is set to happen in the show. So jury's still out on the Securitrons being Mk 1 or Mk 2 versions. \n\nWhat has me curious is when Maximus said his mother was a courier. Couriers had a very important job in New Vegas, it's why you play as one in the game. I wonder if that's just meant as a nod to couriers having important roles in universe or if his mom is THE Courier, Courier 6. Or a previously unknown wife of Ulysses? Wouldn't make sense for Ulysses as a character given the expansion, Lonesome Road, telling us all about his background with the Twisted Hairs and how they were \"assimilated\" by Caesar, but maybe Ulysses survived the encounter with Courier 6 and started a family, potentially with another Courier. Or maybe the player character's Courier is canonized as being female and it was them who married Ulysses. I'm getting sidetracked but New Vegas did so much worldbuilding, I don't feel optimistic the show could live up to every fan's expectations for where it goes after the events of the game but with how well the show handled the universe I'm wanting to have more faith.",

The only semi-nice part of NV was the strip and even then, it was pretty run down. Add another 15 years and I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t look any better.\n\nI think canonizing the House ending only makes sense. The House always winning is a fitting theme for New Vegas and I feel like House is a truly neutral party that wants New Vegas to succeed. \n\nI would love to see a new character in the Legion. Either a full antagonist or an antagonist who is struggling with their choices and is geared up to become a protagonist. Not sure that they\u2019d do that but I think it would show another dark side to the Fallout world.\n\nLast past about the courier situation is very interesting.

They like telling stories of settlements and chaos without any connective tissue, and I think that\u2019s a lot lazier than exploring what happens as people band together and build things (as they always do.)\n\nWar never changes and that\u2019s true whether we have societies or not. The conflict between the factions and societies that form up are, for my money, more interesting than the wasteland is. But that\u2019s not the story Bathesda ever wants to write.",

            "He is so good.  Whenever Homelander is on screen I'm tensed up, waiting for something.  He's managed to convey his instability and sociopathy so well.",
            "He should get an award for the facial twitches alone.",
            "this dude can somehow express different emotions with the top half and bottom half of his face... simultaneously.",
            "I really want to see him in more things after The Boys. Antony has amazing range.",
            "Antony Starr is getting the beer bottles ready if he doesn\u2019t get one this year",
            "Homelander is a freakin\u2019 disturbing villain, Starr really takes it to the next level.",
            "He\u2019s had tough competition until now. Succession is wrapped up, so is better call Saul (how Bob didn\u2019t win is beyond me), as is game of thrones, this is us, and most other long-term winners. \n\nThe race is opening back up. But sadly, shows like this rarely get that kind of attention.",
            "I've been saying this for years: most compelling and iconic TV villain since Joffrey.\n\nAre there other contenders I might have missed?",
            "I mean, he should have gotten one for his work on Banshee.",
            "Please give it to him. I\u2019m legitimately scared he will laser our faces- just give him the Emmy.",
            "His acting absolutely carries the show. The Boys has gotten a tad stale for me with how little it diverts from its formula, but Starr\u2019s acting is fucking killer man.",
            "He does this thing with his face. He'll be smiling, then he'll suddenly stop smiling and his face falls... and his eyes look so cold. It's eerie. He doesn't even have to say a word. \n\nGreat actor.",
            "I want to hate his face so bad. But I know he\u2019s just an actor, he\u2019s playing a role, that\u2019s not who he is. That\u2019s how you know he\u2019s killing it in the role",
            "Gf likes to watch this dubbed in another language she is trying to learn and he is amazing even without speaking lines.  It's all in his facial expressions and body language.  He truly understands the character and how to portray that particular brand of crazy.",
            "The problem is that they\u2019re going for Best Drama instead of Best Comedy. Even the darkest scenes in this show are hilarious because they involve people in capes. There\u2019s a quote along the lines of \u201cIf the news of a nuclear threat reaches the president in the Oval Office, it\u2019s a drama. If it reaches him in the bathroom, it\u2019s a comedy.\u201d As such, this show is a political satire black comedy like Dr. Strangelove.",
            "I watched some promo stuff recently and Starr's real personality is so the opposite of homelander it was jarring. \n\nAlso I watched banshee and he's so good in that too, even tho the show isn't that good.",
            "Starr should start showing off his range in other projects so he doesn\u2019t get typecast as the villain or bad guy the rest of his career.\n\nLook what happened to Giancarlo Esposito after the Gus Fring role for example.",
            "He\u2019s fantastic. I know it\u2019s silly, but when I\u2019m watching him, I really believe he IS Homelander.",
            "I love his performance, and he deserves recognition, but he doesn\u2019t need it nor do I think he\u2019d win. While I know Anthony brings his A-game, the rest of the cast and writing isn\u2019t as strong as his performance and it doesn\u2019t help his chances.",
            "As everyone has said, Starr is amazing. Him showing up at the end of Gen V and his reaction, sealed the greatness for me.",
            "Episode 4 was so good for his chances. So far it\u2019s the episode I\u2019d submit for him.",
            "I concur.",
            "Just finished watching the 4th episode. Probably one of the best episode they had.",
            "The man plays a superhero with a god complex & a detachment from humanity so well that you get tense whenever he shows up because you don\u2019t know what his next move is & if he\u2019s going to kill someone. Every single face twitch or microexpression says what he\u2019s thinking & what he may end up doing.\n\nThat is acting, & Antony Starr does it so well every season that an Emmy for him is overdue.",
            "Show runner and creator isn\u2019t the same thing. The Boys was created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson",
            "In that last episode when he was in front of the broken mirror. That\u2019s a damn great actor",
            "He is the most terrifying villain in any show or story ever.\n\nA completely self aware sociopath that\u2019s seemingly invincible.",
            "I mean yeah, his acting is amazing. That recent scene with the broken mirror was great and he is so great at the quick switch ups.\u00a0",
            "1000% agree",
            "Agreed",
            "I think the fact they made fun of right wingers for so long without right wingers catching on is worthy of some comedy awards at least.",
            "Forreal it really is crazy he hasn\u2019t gotten an Emmy, it is without question one of the greatest villain performances ever and is just completely iconic at this point. Whack as hell the voters have just ignore him because he\u2019s pretty damn deserving every season the show airs",
            "Antory Starr to Homelander is what RDJ is to Tony Stark. The man delivers CHILLING performances.",
            "It's easy to play an asshole when you are one in real life.",
            "I've always said that I think Homelander is the greatest TV character since Walter White. The show gets dismissed as \"genre-fare,\" but Homelander is one of the best, most complex villains ever written.\n\nThat's due in huge part to Anthony Starr's incredibly nuanced portrayal.",
            "ehh, he just keeps repeating the same three or four expressions. gets old after one season.",
            "I just finished banshee yesterday and now watching the Boys. \n\nHe's great",
            "His acting is really incredible. The build up of suppressed rage over the seasons is so well done as is the fracturing of his psyche",
            "I\u2019ve never heard of Antony or even seen him before until one night I decided to try out The Boys, and yeah just wow, brilliant actor.",
            "100%, he is so good",
            "He was so good in episode 4 of this season",
            "Anthony is incredible. Among all the classic villains on TV and film, none make me fear for the safety of anyone in the room more than Homelander.",
            "The Emmys don\u2019t give a shit unless you\u2019re White Lotus or Succession, look at how they treated House of the Dragon last year",
            "I loved him in Banshee, and he is great in this too!",
            "His performance has really elevated the series. And unlike the usual artsy dramatic roles that tend to soak up these awards, he has had to do some wild shit on screen without breaking character.",
            "emmy\u2019s took until Orphan Black\u2019s last season to honor Tatiana Maslany\u2019s work playing 6+ characters in her show, they\u2019re very slow in the genre.",
            "How about a life time achievement award. Outrageous Fortune (Two vastly different characters), Banshee, now the Boys.",
            "The best supervillain portrayal I've seen on, and that's saying something.  I've seen every episode, and every time he's onscreen it feels like I'm going in blind, because you never know what he's going to say or do.  For me, I think he's scariest when he has that BSOD face on, like he does in the movie theater with Stan Edgar and in the montage of interviews at the beginning of this season, when he's just like a black hole of loathing.",
            "Watch an interview with Antony Starr then watch the last episode of The Boys. He totally deserves his flowers. For such a likable human to play such a hated character\u2026my man can act his ass off",
            "\"More spit, Marty, more spit. That\u2019ll work.\"",
            "His Homelander performance will never not remind me of Christian Bale talking about how Tom Cruise inspired his Patrick Bateman performance - \"intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes\".\n\nStarr absolutely nails that look of smiling with every aspect of his face bar his eyes and it's so fucking eerie every time. So good.",
            "He was pretty good this episode!!",
            "Homelander is seriously one of the most well written, well acted characters that we've had on television.",
            "Best villain on tv",
            "The dude deserved it long before on outrageous fortune in NZ, I\u2019m amazed he hasn\u2019t appeared in movies yet.",
            "I know people are frequently critical of the source material, but Anthony Starr ALSO captures the expressions Homelander makes in the graphic novel including looking both imperious and prissy among other impressive things he's doing. \n\nIts really something.",
            "Sorry but no he should\u2019ve gotten it in the first 2 seasons now it\u2019s too late bc the quality of his story has gone downhill\u2026",
            "Yeah I firmly support this.   Antony Starr is ridiculously good.   \n\nWalton Goggins and Antony Starr both need far more praise than they get imo.   They tend to command every scene they are in.   I\u2019d love to see them do something together.",
            "Nah, even tho I don't really enjoy the show as much as I did, I think the only actor who warrants a nomination in the series thus far is Karl Urban , I'd imagine it's far more difficult for an actor to balance being a likable hero and a complete villain then it is to play a irredeemable villain",
            "This is not the type of show or role that gets one an Emmy, even though it definitely has more depth than a marvel show, Emmy voters can\u2019t tell the difference.",
            "great character, absolutely awful albeit very entertaining show.\n\nhard for that to get any awards historically\n\nseason 1 was great, season 2 was really good, season 3 had ups and downs and the cracks were starting to show, and so far the first 3 episodes of season 4 have been very mediocre.\n\nthe writers constantly reset major characters back to zero in their arcs and make up stuff with no prior evidence to establish new plot lines and conflict \n\nit\u2019s like a bad soap opera tied together with shock value from body fluids and superhuman beat downs",
            "He's a very serviceable actor but certainly not Emmy worthy, at least not in this show.",
            "To be honest, he should have won at least one for Banshee.",
            "He missed his chance in season 1.\n\nThe show just isn't good enough this season to get him an Emmy, assuming the second half of season 4 does not see a significant improvement.",
            "I need to watch Banshee again.",
            "Or else he\u2019ll make your head explode",
            "He is the show with a bunch of great supporting actors !!",
            "Anyone remember the Banshee County Sheriff from 11 years ago?",
            "Check him out in Banshee as well, was a fantastic anti-hero in that too.",
            "Give him an Emmy for best jaw movements",
            "I agree. Him and Billy Crudup (Cory on The Morning Show) I think are absolutely fantastic.",
            "Those award shows are run by ol fuddie duddies.",
            "should have won one for his performance as AD's Stray Man",
            "I have been saying this for years.",
            "Agreed.",
            "I think that barfight ruined his chances.",
            "I wanted him to get one back in the day for Banshee.",
            "I just watched The Covenant, and even with a bit (generic) part, he really elevates the character with a memorable performance.",
            "Would be well deserved. Never gonna happen.",
            "It's an easy call. The acting is so good that Homelander is a living being in my mind.",
            "Amazon/Producers keep messing up their Emmy's campaign. In one of the weakest year they decided to drop the season after the submission ended and wait for the next cycle, it'll be forgotten coming next year",
            "I do not know how Anthony Starr can play in other movie without people type-casting him as Homelander.",
            "Seriously",
            "He *crushed* it in today\u2019s episode. And I\u2019m not just talking about that guy\u2019s head.",
            "More than anyone ever, Anthony deserves it. Incredible",
            "2021 was his best shot.",
            "Sadly it\u2019s never about performance.",
            "I love the mirror scenes. He gets a great opportunity to show off his skills.",
            "Honelander scares me. When TV characters can make you feel such unease! John Lithgow in Dexter comes to mind.",
            "His range of emotions while speaking in an American accent is amazing. \n\nHe was also good in Banshee but his acting in the boys is next level.",
            "My husband and I are just watching for the first time and are in the middle of Season 2. I literally said just this the other night when Homelander drank Madelaine's leftover breastmilk from her fridge. The most well-done, horrifying, disgusting thing I've ever seen, but totally in character and real.",
            "He has the character down.  Yup, he deserves Kudos.",
            "Oh hell yes, he gives the role justice.",
            "Part of me wishes the show had pulled a *Starship Troopers* and been from the Supe's viewpoint the whole show, showing how they're fascists without ever literally saying it.",
            "I\u2019ve seen this argument plenty of times does he really deserve it ? He\u2019s good but Emmy?",
            "Yea, no shit. Dude totally nails the character, each and every time he's in front of the camera.",
            "He's right though. Give him the damn Emmy. He deserves a bunch of them by now.",
            "Awards are just gravy, you shouldn\u2019t care about awards",
            "But I hate Homelander SO much.",
            "He's so good. I've never seen anyone act with his face so good.",
            "Dude I was just telling my wife the other day that Homelander's (Anthony's) acting is so damn good when he broke the mirror.",
            "Awards like the Emmys or Oscars don't generally nominate or pay attention to genre stuff, sadly. The Dark Knight was an exception. I can only think of a few sci-fi or comic book movies that have been nominated since for anything like director, actor/actress, writing, cinematography, etc. despite there being plenty of contenders.",
            "Or not.",
            "I have no idea he is a New Zealander. He looks so different in real life, the complete opposite of what Homelander looks like\n\nWithout him and Butcher (another New Zealander) the show can get a bit bland\n\nOkay, I must admit Deep is hilarious\n\n Anthony Starr definitely deserves an Emmy",
            "Do Emmy's have a problem with subversions of classic hero archetypes being made into psychopaths, especially if those hero archetypes have a very American (Captain America) undertone?\n\nThat wasn't a joke or rhetorical. I could totally see the Emmy's snubbing an amazing character if it makes them feel uncomfortable, but I don't know if this specific archetype subversion makes them uncomfortable.",
            "He was amazing in his cameo role on Xena: Warrior Princess back in '96 (filmed in NZ, he was 21 then). Give this man his due.",
            "Thing is, I when I see him\u2026 idk he still seems scary, mans too good of an actor.",
            "100% agreed. Want him in character too.",
            "He deserves it.",
            "He's fire. I constantly think he's gonna snap and laser through someone's dome. He's broken the seal.",
            "Can we please just create a people's Emmy or something so he gets one. Man has EARNED it.",
            "All actors say being the over the top villain is easy work. Anthony Hopkins said he really didn't do anything for is Oscar.",
            "The way he plays a psycho but trying to hold up a veneer of levity than just shoots lasers through a woman\u2019s head and says \u201cI guess I\u2019m just petty\u201d fuckin brilliant \ud83e\udd23",
            "Literally nobody should be disagreeing with this lol",
            "Outrageous Fortune is absolutely worth watching if you\u2019re a fan of Starr.",
            "Ok I need to restart this one",
            "Loved him in Banshee. Love him even more now as Homelander. He has my vote 10000%",
            "Sadly Emmy\u2019s have rods firmly up their own asses when it comes to genre work. For the mostly old farts that decide these things there is drama or comedy shows. All other genres are of the same \u201cget off my lawn\u201d variety.",
            "His Homelander makes me uncomfortable whenever he is on screen",
            "Intense. All I can say",
            "Homelander is my favorite. He plays bad so freaking good.\u00a0",
            "Gonna be hard to beat Sanada for Best Actor",
            "These conversations are always a bit dumb. Every year we get mad that 5 different people didn't win the Emmy. One person, just one, wins an Emmy for Best Actor in their category. Every year you have several amazing performances. It's a subjective tossup who you give it to.",
            "He better get one, dude did such a good job it's impossible to see him as not a bad guy.",
            "Maybe for Banshee",
            "His character is just so unhinged, you never know if he's going to laser your balls off or not.",
            "Have a Fresca Anthony",
            "The first three episodes were the best comedy I've seen in a while. Even when Homelander was on, I somehow didn't find myself on the edge of my seat I usually do, maybe because of The Deep. This episode reminded me of the Homelander I feared.",
            "Sometimes a show/actor will slip through but in general, Emmy voters are biased against genre shows (fantasy, sci-fi, etc)\n\nIts really unfair but it is what it is.",
            "Stop Caring About Awards!",
            "He is a good Stray-Man. Too bad he had to be put down.",
            "I mean a lot of times they wait until a series last season, partly because of posterity and partly because creators go all out last season. Jon hamm in mad man, Kieran Cullen in succession, Mr robot. My guess is Antony gets it when homelander dies.",
            "Lol he is good in the role, but I strongly disagree",
            "If you want to see his earlier work where he played two very different twins on an excellent Kiwi tv show, watch Outrageous Fortune.",
            "The Boys was created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, neither of whom are quoted in the article.",
            "How he didn't get anything for Banshee (no one did) across 5 seconds is beyond me.  Seriously, give the dude an Emmy.",
            "He is genuinely fucking terrifying.",
            "Anthony's portrayal of Homelander on screen surpasses any superhero or supervillain in making me feel truly tense, a feat few have achieved.",
            "Yeah I been waiting so long where\u2019s my Emmy",
            "Those awards mean nothing",
            "S4 E4 was another level, he\u2019s unbelievably good, he is Homelander. He\u2019s fantastic in Banshee also but he is totally doing  justice to the Homelander character",
            "I wish the courts had given him jail time for assaulting that service worker but ok.",
            "Is season 4 going to be the last season?",
            "I hate this show so much because of this character. And never watched past season one. So maybe he does deserve an Emmy.",
            "Yep season 4 episode 4 was definitely Starr's Emmy episode this season. His subplot was incredible and his acting throughout it was insane.",
            "I just watched episode 4 and if he doesn\u2019t win an Emmy based on that episode alone it will be a travesty.  He is playing such a complicated and disturbed character.",
            "Agreed. He's doing an amazing job, especially once you see him as himself and realize just how much acting he's actually doing. \n\nAnd honestly, Jessie T. Usher deserves credit too, for playing A-Train so convincingly conflicted. He's going through an incredibly complex emotional arc as a character, starting out as an uncaring asshole and gradually morphing into a guy we can almost sympathize with... If not for the murders.",
            "Homelander, deserves an Emmy for his performance he has been an absolute revelation in Season 3 and Season 4.",
            "The \u201coh noooo he\u2019s gonna snappp\u201d narrative rut they got themselves into is so old",
            "The Boys as a show isn\u2019t Emmy worthy but Antony\u2019s performance is, I guess the Emmys voters don\u2019t take him in consideration because he stars in a superhero show.",
            "Guy has me convinced he\u2019s a psycho with superman powers at home and at work.\n\nGive him whatever he wants. \n\nJust in case.",
            "For me it\u2019s all the little micro expressions in his face. You can see his thoughts flicker back and forth. Terrifying",
            "Seriously, there's not a single superhero or supervillain who has ever made me feel tense as Anthony's portrayal of Homelander when he's on screen. If they've ever made me feel that way at all.",
            "He\u2019s a character that you hate and feel bad for, his portrayal is perfect for that.",
            "Ramsey Bolton Superman, just terrifying in his portrayal",
            "One of the best TV villains of all time, no doubt. Both in terms of the character's potential actions and actor portrayal. Hard time choosing between him and Joffrey from Game of Thrones.",
            "Watching his interviews and off screen behavior one might wonder if Homelander plays Antony Starr.",
            "Have you seen him play twins in the show \u201coutrageous fortune\u201d?",
            "this is really well summed up. And think between Homelander and Neuman , Neuman should be the more terrifying but you know that Neuman is rational.",
            "How much of that is his acting and how much of it is the character being a deranged sociopath who is far and away the most powerful entity in his universe?",
            "Definitely.  The dude is terrifying and completely believable.  He does such an amazing job.  It is at the same caliber as ledger's joker.",
            "The ability to make the audience hate the character so thoroughly without resorting to gaudy extremes is a testament to the writers and the actor.\n\nAnthony Hopkins couldn't get a decent role in movies for years after *Silence of the Lambs*.\n\nAntony Starr might have a similar problem.",
            "Yes",
            "Same my hands sweat every time he enters a scene",
            "He's a scene stealer.",
            "Todays episode alone is worth and Emmy",
            "I know right??? I absolutely LOATH him but that just means he\u2019s playing the role TOO well. \ud83d\ude05 I almost hate the poor dude for playing him.",
            "> He is so good.\n\nStarr seems like the exact opposite of Homelander in real life. lol\n\n[The Boys\u2019 Antony Starr vs. Chace Crawford | Hot Ones Versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqv9-GYau70)",
            "It\u2019s this. 1000x over. His scenes propel the root tension of the show. He completely inhabits that character. When he\u2019s on screen - that\u2019s truly when I fear for the protagonists. Or anyone in his field of vision. His performer has been sublime from day 1.",
            "He was at a con nearby and I was subconsciously afraid of him even out of character.",
            "He made me understand the stereotypical \"evil general\" in Superman who's always wanting to take Superman down or otherwise keep him contained.\n\nBecause I get it, now. Superman is unbelievably pure and good. Not only does he work hard all the time, which is rare in itself, but he's unfailingly selfless. I can think of *maybe* three people in all my life I've met who fit even one of those categories. He's one-in-a-million. \n\nWould *you* trust that, in real life?",
            "And a pretty great American accent. I know it\u2019s way more apparent of a good/bad one going from ours to Brit or Aussie but it\u2019s one of those where I didn\u2019t even know he wasn\u2019t American",

He\u2019s super human on a scale where humans are to Homelander as, I don\u2019t know, earthworms are to humans.\n\nThe show makes a big deal about what a psycho he is, but really\u2026 do we stop to consider whether our plans have a big impact on earthworms?  Not really.  Progress goes on whether it ends up killing a bunch of worms or not.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s an interesting character arc to see a character that has to pretend to be human when, really, he doesn\u2019t have any equals.  The audience, and the characters around him, judge him for his lack of humanity, but also\u2026 why?  How do we expect him to learn about consequences when none apply to him?",

I think a LOT of people still think \"everyone's redeemable of they are shown the light\", but you can plant a narcissist in the middle of the light their entire lives and they'll never do anything except fight against it. We can see this with how fast people jump to calling really cruel or destructive people \"psychopaths\" (which is ASPD, not NPD) because they don't fully grasp that narcissists are almost capable of the same level of destruction.

It has multiple rounds; the first round eliminates any candidate with less than 12.5% of the vote, with each subsequent round eliminating the candidate with the least support until one gets over 50%. That means you don't need to vote 'strategically' in the first round; they say vote with your heart in the first round, and with your head in the last round. In practice it kind of functions like ranked-choice in a way; candidates who are eliminated advice their voters to vote for one of the remaining candidates in the next round, or they throw in their lot with a larger candidate and ask their potential voters to follow them. \n\nI've always thought that the German voting system would also work well in the US, at least for House elections.\n\nGermany is a federation, like the US. Their Lower House (Bundestag) has a minimum of 598 members. They give each voter two votes; one for a local candidate for their district (299 districts total) and one for a national party. All the local candidates end up in the Bundestag. The other 299 seats are distributed over the parties in such a way that any party with at least 5% of the vote nationally will have proportional representation, even if they didn't win enough districts for that. \n\nSo, for example:\n\n* Party A: 40% of the vote, 190 districts\n* Party B: 25% of the vote, 70 districts\n* Party C: 10% of the vote, 30 districts\n* Party D: 10% of the vote, 9 districts\n* Party E: 5% of the vote, no districts\n\nParty A will get 190 seats from their districts, plus an additional 49 seats to get to the (40% of 598 =) 239 seats needed for proportional representation on a national level.\n\nParty B will get 70 seats from their districts, plus an additional 79 to get to (25% of 598 =) 149 seats needed.\n\nParty C will get 30 seats from their districts, plus an additional 30 to get to the (10% of 598 =) 60 seats needed.\n\nParty D will get 9 seats from their districts, plus an additional 51 to get to the (10% of 598 =) 60 seats needed.\n\nParty E will not get any seats from their districts (because they didn't win any), but they will get 30 seats on a national level for proportional represenation.\n\nIf a party wins more districts than needed to get to proportional representation, the entire Bundestag will be increased in size and the math will be done for the new size. The extra seats gained in this way are called 'overhang seats' (Uberhangmandate).",

But their House members would 100% be voting for Trump because of the statewide gerrymandering that gives the state 5 Dem House members to 9 Rep. House members. They would ignore the will of their people overall because of the unfair advantage they\u2019ve given themselves in state drawn maps. \n\nI think that was/is part of their election strategy (and part of why they pushed the fake electors to try and change the electoral college numbers just a fraction), they didn\u2019t need to win but just needed to make sure Hillary or Biden couldn\u2019t get to 270. They already don\u2019t want/need to get the popular vote, imagine if they won by not getting the popular AND electoral college votes. They claim the system is rigged against them, but honestly it\u2019s rigged to favor them. Dems really need to get better messaging out to rural communities. Rural communities in red states have so much more power than they think.",

If your team is losing you need to fix yourself not change the rules so you can still win like they\u2019ve been doing. We shouldn\u2019t allow the entire country to sink because some Regressive politicians want to live in nostalgia of the idealized country of old, but that\u2019s what our current system is letting happen.",

Really doesn\u2019t make much sense.",
            "And I don't want either of those. If they ran a normal presidential candidate on either side, that person would win easily. An 81-year-old centrist Dem is not going to be equipped to deal with the challenges of our time.",

Are they stupid?",

Especially this year with Trump and Biden both being unpopular.\n\nJust because the double haters don't want to vote for either major party candidate doesn't mean that they want to vote for a 3rd party candidate or even know who they are. Which is where the wording of polling questions comes in. If you ask the respondent to name who they want to vote for RFK does worse. If you provide a longer list of 3rd party candidates RFK does worse. If you give a \"none of these candidates\" option RFK does worse. The only polls he actually performs around 15% in are ones where the question is a choice between Biden, Trump, and RFK.",
            "Not so fast.  I know someone that voted Biden, but then a while back constantly was sharing RFK shit on his fb and talking about how we all need to really consider him.  No idea if he's still doing it, i had to unfollow him because it was just too much.",

In '80, Teddy immediately shot his campaign in the foot by not being able to answer the question, \"Why do you want to be president?\" And of course, in '60, JFK winning was something of am upset against Nixon, VP to the incredibly popular Eisenhower. So perhaps \"Kennedy\" was considered a shoe-in for '64, but that's it.",
            "Right. And I'm going to say something a little harsh here, but those people are equally to blame as those that vote for whoever makes it into office. There are a myriad of reasons they might stay home, but an unfortunate number of them are rooted in willful ignorance, denial, or selfishness.\n\nWe would all like to imagine the world is a better place than it is. We would all like to imagine that a third-party candidate has a shot. We would all like to imagine that a protest vote will somehow get your party of choice to realize it isn't doing X thing you think it should do. We would all like to think if enough of us stay home, it'll finally send that message.\n\nBut none of that is real. Reality is that either Biden or Trump will be our next President barring any unfortunate health-related event. Not even jail will prevent Trump from running. No third party will be President in 2025. They just won't.\n\nAnd so every single vote cast for RFK is not only wasted, it also stands a significant chance of helping whoever you don't want in the job to win after all. And every single vote not cast helps that outcome occur. There are not enough people to vote the third-party candidate into power but there are enough people to swing the election by voting for him, so voting third party out of a sense of indignation over the state of our nation's political structure might make you feel righteous and justified, but it doesn't get you a third party President. And it will get you one of the two other guys.\n\nDisregarding all of that out of anger at the Democrats (let's be real, RFK is running as a spoiler to swing it to Trump, their own campaign has admitted it) sure tickles the justice bone, but it ends with Project 2025, the dismantling of the federal government, and the greatest assault on human rights since the Nuremburg Laws. It's not hyperbole, it's not hysteria, that's what everyone said about Trump and Roe and here we are with was-pregnant-until-an-hour-ago women bleeding out in emergency room floors because their doctors believe they'll be charged if the woman doesn't at least have sepsis.",
