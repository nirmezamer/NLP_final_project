            "Bodkin was great. The humor was like The Banshees of Inisherin.",
            "**Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini**  If you are into whodunnits..this is real good especially if you dont read anything about it or know the story.  Thanks to whoever recommended this last week.. i went in blind and really enjoyed it.",
            "I just finished the last two episodes of \"Ripley\" and was shocked by how good it was. I hope it gets a second season (or more). Thoroughly enthralling. \n\nNext up: The Bear S3",
            "I just finished Fallout. Best new show of the year for me",
            "The Bear S3 E1. That episode just hit perfect for me. The pacing, the music, the tension and grief. I don't often set everything aside while watching tv but that first episode drew my full attention. Looking forward to slowly watching the rest.",
            "Dark matter.   Its quite good after 2 episodes.   Really liking presumed innocent mainly bc my wife is into it so we watch together.  Also Las Vegas is on prime.  Its such a Comfort show for me. Silicon Valley also rewatching",
            "I've only watched the first four episodes of season 3 of **The Bear** but...woof. I don't need things to move fast for the sake of moving fast but I agree with the reviews calling this season \"aimless\" so far. I feel like I'm watching a SNL skit parodying the show. No issues with the acting performances but the writing and directing has been insufferable. I genuinely hope the rest of the season improves and if not, that the final season is a worthy end to what is a great show when it doesn't get in its own way.",
            "Still enjoying **Presumed Innocent**, I can't understate how much I hate having a week gap in between episodes though!",

Jon Stewart makes a statement, shows a clip, looks at the camera weirdly, the audience laugh, and some how Im supposed to learn something new? I think hes just using too much shock factor and I often lose interest in the topic",

            "I bet the timing is a big part of it. This debate was so early, neither of them are even officially nominated yet.",

            "I feel an important piece of context is that like 25% fewer people have cable then did in 2020, which accounts for 18 million fewer viewers even if the interest in the debates was identical. People are also able to do out and do things at this time, which is a change from 2020. Now having said that, there is clearly less interest in the presidential debates than there were 4 years ago.",
            "Everyone decided back in 2020 who to vote for.",
            "Trump spoke clearly but he was rambling complete nonsense. They kept having to ask him the same question over and over because he would immediately go off the rails. \n\nNeither candidate should be running for president but hopefully there is enough voters that can see through Trumps relentless fear mongering and blatant lies.",
