            "Jeff Guinn's Biography of Charles Manson. Honestly it's my favourite book about Manson so far. Helter Skelter is very interesting but is reading someone very personally invested's self-serving account. Chaos brings up some interesting points about the shadiness around the case but spins into paranoid nonsense attempting to feebly make connections that aren't there. \n\nGuinn's Biography does by far the best job of showing how Manson managed to manipulate his followers. His life was unbelievably ideal as the background of a cult leader. It's crazy that an individual had all these perfect experiences that made him an effective cult leader especially someone as uneducated and unfortunate as Charlie.\n\nCharlie was influenced by a huge amount of things. When he was a teenager he was given Dale Carnegie courses. Dale Carnegie was the author of How to Win Friends and Influence People, so this taught him how to manipulate people or at least get them interested in him. Later he was a pimp which taught him how to identify vulnerable young women, the right vulnerable young women though Manson rejected various women for The Family because he felt they were too independent or too well-adjusted or whatever because he realized they could influence the others to leave him. It also taught him various ways to control them. For example he never allowed women to have any money on them at all, not a single cent. If they were doing something that involved money usually begging they had to have a male follower there to hold the money. This is a pimp trick, it means the woman has no easy way to escape him, they don't even have a quarter to use the phone. His next major influence was Scientology in Prison as he was briefly a Scientologist, he was taught how to recruit people to Scientology which he used for his own Cult later. Then after he got out of prison he learned various things in the Haight, the streetpreachers influenced his own preaching. Then an anarchist theater group called the Diggers influenced him. They would dumpster dive for food and hand them out to the various hippies around the Haight. The Manson Family constantly did this it's how they got the vast majority of their food. He also took the Diggers sexist structure of the women doing all the work, although that was just affirming what he already believed he was clearly going to do that anyway, watching the Diggers likely just gave him further pointers on how to control them. \n\nThis all led to isolation, the peak of the Manson Family was when they were freeloading off Dennis Wilson but even then Charlie would make sure to stay for days at the awful Spahn Ranch because he didn't want his followers getting too used to the good life and wanting that for themselves which would lead to them leaving him. Demonizing parents who these young women had issues with. Drugging he'd give them much higher doses of LSD than he'd take himself and sometimes he'd take none at all which was very effective because they barely knew who they were while Charlie looks as energetic and charismatic as ever which makes him seem almost like more than human. And a whole host of other things. It's also interesting that he told numerous people that if he was ever arrested he would act as crazy as possible so they would let him go, nonsensical of course but it explains why he came across so insane he knew he didn't want people to think he was capable of controlling other human beings.",

            "A non-recommendation - a *very disappointing* book about missing people, If You Were There by Francisco Garcia. Reasons:\n\nA British weakness - over-emphasis on processes and procedures, and I have noted before the general lack of British case studies - is in full view. There is a lot of talk with those involved, sometimes peripherally, with the policy and politics of missing people but very little on the actual events, including relatives and those who returned. (Probably simply because the first is easier to do - we have a lot of garrulous academics, consultants and the like).\n\nIt required a competent editor as the amount of padding is unreal. If the author is going to Dundee to interview someone, start with the interview and not the (irrelevant) train journey or (irrelevant) travelogues about the improvements made to Dundee in the past twenty years.\n\nThe author had a reason to write about missing people - his father was missing - but fell into the trap of making it largely about him, which comes across as horribly self-indulgent with his personal circumstances jutting into the argument ever few pages. (I just discovered that the man and child on the cover is author and child, anonymised!!)\n\nJust about everything in the book could have been found out by reading The Guardian. In fact, the whole thing reads like an enormously bloated Guardian article - the tone is spot on, which is not a compliment here.\n\nThis is going to come across as appallingly patronising ... but the author is in his 20s and sounds it. It seems as though you have to be hard-boiled to write successfully about missing people. (I am 30 years older and am always thinking \"is this too obscure?\" \"have I done the victim a disservice?\" and the rest of it about my pieces).\n\nThat said, the author writes very incisively about (almost non-existent) [\"pushers\"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-45173888), dismissing the arguments for them in short order. If the rest of the book had been to that standard ... it would not have been a book, as all the padding, hand-waving and fluff would have been deleted and made the text too concise.\n\nBut, in a crying irony, he points to [the work of the University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/short-courses-and-cpd/missing-persons-global-perspectives) which appears to fill in the gaps his book leaves (\"During your studies, you'll get an understanding of real practices used by those investigating and managing cases [...] and focus on day-to-day missing person cases\").\n\nI have only just started on it, but The Last Place You'd Look by Carole Moore is on a completely different level.

        "content": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank everyone for your comments about Skye Angers and her daughter Grai- I hope that they will be found soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to highlight another Doe case. I found out about it thanks to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/1dq4nnj/who_was_carlos_f_otero_reno_john_doe_august_14/) thread on r/gratefuldoe.\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 14th of August, a man named Carlos F. Otero checked into the Colonial Motor Inn #208 in Reno, Nevada, USA, using a Bronx, New York address. When a maid came in to clean the room around 12:30 PM, she found mr. Otero deceased. He was lying in the bath of the motel room's bathroom on his back, with a pillow under his head. Two intravenous solutions were hanging from the shower rod, and they were attached to an IV that went into mr. Otero's right arm. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\n  \nWhen the police tried to contact mr. Otero's family, they have found out that the name he gave was fake, as was the address in Bronx. A suicide note for his family, dated for the 11th of August 1999, was found in the room; The contents were never shared with the public, but mr. Otero hasn't used any identifying informations such as names. The note is still on file in the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\n  \nThe drugs he used to commit suicide were described as \"LR\" (but I couldn't find what it could be) and thiopental, a type of barbiturate that is most commonly used in anesthesia and inducing comas, but also in euthanasias and lethal injections. It's also the chemical known as the famous \"truth serum\". \n\n  \nMr. Otero was a white man, around 50-60 years old. He was 5'5\" (65 inch / 165 cm) and 137 lbs (62 kg). He had brown, curly hair with grey roots, measuring about 2\" (5 cm) and a mustache. His eyes were blue. He had a 9 inch (23 cm) vertical scar on his stomach. At the moment of death, he was wearing a brown short-sleeve pajama top, red plaid boxer shorts and a pair of brown socks. It's noted that glasses were found, but it isn't clear if he had them on at the moment of death. He also had partial upper dentures.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis case is one of those where you know exactly what happened, but everything surrounding it is a mystery- what was mr. Otero's real name? Why did he commit suicide in that specific hotel? Why did he use such an unusual method? Where is his family?\n\n  \nThe thiopental he used might actually be the biggest clue in this case; The drug is heavily controlled, and not something that an average person could easily get their hands on. It is, however, also used in veterinary practice, and getting larger amounts of it that way would be much easier. This means that there's a big chance that mr. Otero was a veterinarian, or someone closely related to this profession. If we knew what LR was, then maybe it would be even more clear. \n\n  \nThe scene of his death is such a tragic one- he decided to commit suicide in the bathtub, but he knew that he's going to drift off to sleep, so he took a pillow to prop up his head and wore what are essentially pajamas. I'd imagine he picked a bathtub because he could hang the IV drip on the shower rod, but he probably wanted to make it as comfortable and as similar to dying in bed as possible. \n\n  \nThe suicide note is also such a fascinating piece of this case; It's dated for the 11th of August, but mr. Otero was found deceased on the 16th, five days later. I wonder if he planned to commit suicide on the 11th, but either backed out or something happened that made it impossible to carry it out. What was he doing in these last days? What was he thinking about, how did he feel? It's also very interesting that he made the note for his family, but didn't identify anyone by name, like he expected to be identified at some point, but he didn't want to give the investigators any clues about who he might've been. He commited suicide alone, in a hotel, while using a fake name, so he clearly didn't want to be identified, but he also left a note for his family, like he both wanted and didn't want them to know that he took his own life. I could imagine he must've felt a lot of internal turmoil and wasn't 100% about going through with the suicide, between the old date on the suicide letter and the fact that he wrote it without any identifying info. I understand that the note wasn't released to the public out of likely concerns for mr. Otero's and his family's privacy and I respect that, but I can't help but wonder what this letter said- there's a chance, a slim one, but still, that someone might've recognized something about it, like the handwriting for example. \n\n\n\nThe good news is that mr. Otero's body was found quickly, so fingerprints are available, as are dentals; What's most important is that his DNA was also taken and is available, though not submitted yet. If the DNA is available, then doing a reverse genealogy search should also be possible, and it's only a matter of time and resources. A confirmed suicide from 1999 is probably quite low on the list of priorities, but I believe that this case could be solved if enough attention was drawn to it, and if someone like othram would reach out to the right authorities. Nevertheless, I hope that mr. Otero's family will one day be able to recieve and read the letter he left them.   \n\n  \nIf you believe you have any info about mr. Otero's identity, contact the Reno Police Department at (775) 334-2175 (case number 189998-99).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1. [NamUS.gov](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/7633/details)\n2.

            "It\u2019s interesting that you mention the potential of him working in the veterinary field, because vets have high rates of suicide- about 2-4x higher that of the general population. Lots of burnout, financial woes (student loan debt, running your own practice, etc.), compassion fatigue from caring for sick and injured animals and having to put them to sleep, and studies have found that having access to euthanasia drugs puts them at a higher risk too.",
            "Lactated Ringers sounds right for LR. It is one of most common IV solutions. It is available in bags of 250ml, 500ml, and 1 liter. A second bag of the same solution with thiopental added to it could be piggy backed once a line was established.",

Car left in the lot?  Taxi?  If so, where did they pick him up at? And so on\u2026",

I think the veterinarian (or other medical professional) angle is most likely. \n\nAs for the note to his family\u2026.a family member of mine did this and they wrote the notes out 1-2 weeks beforehand, probably because they were in a state of diminished capacity (dementia) already. Could be as simple as just wanting to take the time to prep everything the way he wanted it, though not leaving any clue as to who his family was is puzzling. This might be because they too weren\u2019t in a clear state of mind at the time, but that\u2019s just a theory. \n\nInteresting case. Sad.",
            "Being a vet sounds right. If not a vet, then a nurse or phlebotomist (excuse my spelling)  As someone who spends a lot of time in hospitals and doctors offices, I've only ever had one ER doc do an IV and he needed an ultrasound to do it properly lol (usually I'm a one stick wonder)",

His friend grounp assumed he walked back to his on-campus apartment. But they would later learn he never made it back home. When Guimond failed to attend a campus related event, it was then that his friends filed a missing person report with local law enforcement.\n\nIn the hours or day after Guimond went missing, an unidentified/unknown individual deleted information from his computer hard drive. Some of the information, however, was later retrieved. This formerly deleted information was about instructions on  making false identification cards. Also, let behind in his apartment were several  personal belongings. Including glasses and a credit card. In addition, his vehicle would be found still parked on campus. Nothing inside  the car was taken, and the vehicle itself was undisturbed and still in working order.\n\nSome theories are that Guimond committed suicide or voluntary dissappeared of his own free will.

            "He probably sold fake IDs on campus and if a second person had access to his computer, or was somehow involved, that person probably deleted the data to not get in trouble for the fake IDs - or to not cause trouble for the customers on campus. \n\nI think the knowledge of faking IDs has nothing to do with voluntarily wanting to leave, at least not in this case. Cause if that was the intention and he gained that knowledge to disappear that would mean he planned it thoroughly and that would mean he would have chosen a different time and occasion to do so. On a party, while going to the restrooms, with people waiting for him and missing him at least the next day or so? I think you would choose a time that gives you a bigger head start if you wanna disappear.\n\nTo me it sounds like drunkenly needing to take a piss, either using the restrooms and than deciding to go home or deciding to go home and take a piss outside on the way to the restrooms. And than having an accident while outside - there are two lakes, there is a park, you get stupid ideas when drunk (you don\u2019t have to be hammered) of where you wanna go next and how to get there, you take ways you didn\u2019t take before \u2026 I guess the search just missed him. \n\nHe could still be in the/a building if he decided to explore the cellar or the roof or whatever.",
            "Wow. Does sound a bit like voluntarily disappearance.",
            "His friends from the party must know more.",
            "That would depend on his dioptre, but I don't see someone who wears glasses just leaving them behind. Unless he had a backup pair with him. If your dioptre is high, you're effectively blind without them.",
            "If I remember correctly they did search the water, both up and down stream, and there was no evidence of him.",
            "Not only did they search the water several times, but apparently students had fallen in and drowned before and usually floated to the surface in the spring. Investigators thought this might happen to Josh as well but he never surfaced. There\u2019s also some woody areas near campus so that\u2019s also a possibility. I still think it\u2019s possibly foul play but nothing can really be ruled out\u2026 poor family",
            "I agree with you - Josh was 19, so he might've just had personal reasons to look up how to do a fake ID rather than running his own operation. He was last going for a bathroom break... check close-by water from experience of drunk males going missing.\n\nAs for deleted browser cache after he went missing... if he had roommates that also used that computer, I can see them deleting it to protect Josh / themselves from embarassment. None of them were going to admit to doing that either."

        "content": "*This is my first write-up for reddit. I'm covering one unsolved case from each of the counties of Sweden in alphabetical order \u2014 21 in total. First out is Blekinge County in the south of Sweden.*\n\nThe administrative county covers exactly the same geographical area as the traditional Blekinge province and is made up of five municipalities. It's the lake-densest of all twenty-one counties and is located only a few hours away from Denmark. The capital of the region is Karlskrona, a World Heritage Site, which is spread across thirty islands.\n\n**THE VICTIM**\n\nThomas Karlsson is described as a lively, sweet and impulsive person but also someone who could become rowdy when he consumed alcohol. When he was under the influence, he liked to bicker, but according to his partner no more than any other average twenty-five-year-old.\n\n**THE MURDER**\n\nOn July 9th, Thomas is home with his newborn daughter in the village of Levalunda, Sweden, while his partner is with her younger brother and an aunt at Kar\u00f6n, a popular excursion destination during the summer. Kar\u00f6n is one of the largest islands in the Ronneby archipelago and is located around twelve minutes away from Levalunda by car.\n\nWhen the first police patrol arrives, Thomas is still conscious. He states that he had been resting in the bedroom when he heard noises from the kitchen door. When he went to investigate, he was hit with a blast from a shotgun. The shot traveled through a pane of glass in the door, but Thomas doesn\u2019t reveal who fired the gun. The police asks the question but they get no answer. A little later, Thomas passes away in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that Anna is away from home after giving birth to her daughter. Over the PA system, an Anna Gustafsson is called for, but since it's a common name, she doesn't think it's specifically her they mean. When the name is repeated, she still goes to check what it's about and is there met by the police. Anna's first thought is that Thomas has been involved in a car accident. Since he's impulsive, she wonders if he got behind the wheel after drinking alcohol. It wouldn't surprise her. The cops tell her that she can talk to Thomas herself when they meet at the hospital, but by the time she arrives it's too late. Thomas is dead.\n\n**SUSPECTS**\n\nA man aged twenty-eight is soon a suspect. The theory is that he has a connection to Anna - Thomas' partner - and that the motive is jealousy. While the suspect is being interrogated, a search is carried out in his residence. A shirt that is found is sent to SKL - the State's forensic laboratory - and according to the analysis, there is lead dust and glass fragments on the fabric.\n\nThe suspect denies any involvement and is never charged as apparently the evidence is too weak.\n\nThere is another man mentioned in the investigation as a person of interest and that is none other than Anna's father. His shotgun is missing and shotgun shells are found buried on his property. The father is also very nervous when talking to the police.\n\nTwo months later, Anna's father commits suicide. It should be noted that he was never arrested or charged with anything in connection to the murder.\n\nThe case is still unsolved today.\n\n  \n**Sources (in Swedish):**\n\n[https://polisen.se/aktuellt/kalla-fall/2018/december/thomas-karlsson/](https://polisen.se/aktuellt/kalla-fall/2018/december/thomas-karlsson/) \n\n[https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/7112993](https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/7112993) \n\n[https://www.blt.se/ronneby/polisen-oppnar-26-ar-gammalt-mordfall/](https://www.blt.se/ronneby/polisen-oppnar-26-ar-gammalt-mordfall/) \n\n",

            "An unresolved mystery I'm very familiar with. My sister lived (years later) in the same house he was shot in. We did not know the guy, but it was talked about a lot, especially in a small place like Levalunda. The house is in the middle of nowhere!",
            "What is Anna's father's motive?  And wouldn't Thomas recognize his own father in law and tell police it was him?",

            "Did your sister ever feel creeped out when living there?",
            "Sounds like he was losing consciousness by the time police arrived. Also if it was dark or even if it wasn\u2019t but the perp had been wearing a mask or hood he may not have seen them at all.",
