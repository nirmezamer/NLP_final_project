        "content": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank everyone for your comments about Skye Angers and her daughter Grai- I hope that they will be found soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to highlight another Doe case. I found out about it thanks to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/1dq4nnj/who_was_carlos_f_otero_reno_john_doe_august_14/) thread on r/gratefuldoe.\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 14th of August, a man named Carlos F. Otero checked into the Colonial Motor Inn #208 in Reno, Nevada, USA, using a Bronx, New York address. When a maid came in to clean the room around 12:30 PM, she found mr. Otero deceased. He was lying in the bath of the motel room's bathroom on his back, with a pillow under his head. Two intravenous solutions were hanging from the shower rod, and they were attached to an IV that went into mr. Otero's right arm. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\n  \nWhen the police tried to contact mr. Otero's family, they have found out that the name he gave was fake, as was the address in Bronx. A suicide note for his family, dated for the 11th of August 1999, was found in the room; The contents were never shared with the public, but mr. Otero hasn't used any identifying informations such as names. The note is still on file in the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\n  \nThe drugs he used to commit suicide were described as \"LR\" (but I couldn't find what it could be) and thiopental, a type of barbiturate that is most commonly used in anesthesia and inducing comas, but also in euthanasias and lethal injections. It's also the chemical known as the famous \"truth serum\". \n\n  \nMr. Otero was a white man, around 50-60 years old. He was 5'5\" (65 inch / 165 cm) and 137 lbs (62 kg). He had brown, curly hair with grey roots, measuring about 2\" (5 cm) and a mustache. His eyes were blue. He had a 9 inch (23 cm) vertical scar on his stomach. At the moment of death, he was wearing a brown short-sleeve pajama top, red plaid boxer shorts and a pair of brown socks. It's noted that glasses were found, but it isn't clear if he had them on at the moment of death. He also had partial upper dentures.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis case is one of those where you know exactly what happened, but everything surrounding it is a mystery- what was mr. Otero's real name? Why did he commit suicide in that specific hotel? Why did he use such an unusual method? Where is his family?\n\n  \nThe thiopental he used might actually be the biggest clue in this case; The drug is heavily controlled, and not something that an average person could easily get their hands on. It is, however, also used in veterinary practice, and getting larger amounts of it that way would be much easier. This means that there's a big chance that mr. Otero was a veterinarian, or someone closely related to this profession. If we knew what LR was, then maybe it would be even more clear. \n\n  \nThe scene of his death is such a tragic one- he decided to commit suicide in the bathtub, but he knew that he's going to drift off to sleep, so he took a pillow to prop up his head and wore what are essentially pajamas. I'd imagine he picked a bathtub because he could hang the IV drip on the shower rod, but he probably wanted to make it as comfortable and as similar to dying in bed as possible. \n\n  \nThe suicide note is also such a fascinating piece of this case; It's dated for the 11th of August, but mr. Otero was found deceased on the 16th, five days later. I wonder if he planned to commit suicide on the 11th, but either backed out or something happened that made it impossible to carry it out. What was he doing in these last days? What was he thinking about, how did he feel? It's also very interesting that he made the note for his family, but didn't identify anyone by name, like he expected to be identified at some point, but he didn't want to give the investigators any clues about who he might've been. He commited suicide alone, in a hotel, while using a fake name, so he clearly didn't want to be identified, but he also left a note for his family, like he both wanted and didn't want them to know that he took his own life. I could imagine he must've felt a lot of internal turmoil and wasn't 100% about going through with the suicide, between the old date on the suicide letter and the fact that he wrote it without any identifying info. I understand that the note wasn't released to the public out of likely concerns for mr. Otero's and his family's privacy and I respect that, but I can't help but wonder what this letter said- there's a chance, a slim one, but still, that someone might've recognized something about it, like the handwriting for example. \n\n\n\nThe good news is that mr. Otero's body was found quickly, so fingerprints are available, as are dentals; What's most important is that his DNA was also taken and is available, though not submitted yet. If the DNA is available, then doing a reverse genealogy search should also be possible, and it's only a matter of time and resources. A confirmed suicide from 1999 is probably quite low on the list of priorities, but I believe that this case could be solved if enough attention was drawn to it, and if someone like othram would reach out to the right authorities. Nevertheless, I hope that mr. Otero's family will one day be able to recieve and read the letter he left them.   \n\n  \nIf you believe you have any info about mr. Otero's identity, contact the Reno Police Department at (775) 334-2175 (case number 189998-99).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1. [NamUS.gov](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/7633/details)\n2.

A handwritten 1 and 4 can look similar so I wonder how confident detectives are that it was dated the 11th and not the 14th. If it was the 11th it begs the question whether he originally intended to commit suicide 3 days earlier or whether he prepared the note then. Or it could have been an error or intentional misdirection.\n\nETA: He was found dead on Monday the 16th not on the day he checked in.",

His friend grounp assumed he walked back to his on-campus apartment. But they would later learn he never made it back home. When Guimond failed to attend a campus related event, it was then that his friends filed a missing person report with local law enforcement.\n\nIn the hours or day after Guimond went missing, an unidentified/unknown individual deleted information from his computer hard drive. Some of the information, however, was later retrieved. This formerly deleted information was about instructions on  making false identification cards. Also, let behind in his apartment were several  personal belongings. Including glasses and a credit card. In addition, his vehicle would be found still parked on campus. Nothing inside  the car was taken, and the vehicle itself was undisturbed and still in working order.\n\nSome theories are that Guimond committed suicide or voluntary dissappeared of his own free will. A theory that could possibly explain why he was researching how to create fake identification cards\n\nHis family lives in Maple Lake, Minnesota.

Its unusual that his body did not come up, but its not impossible- it may have gotten caught on something underwater that kept it from coming up.  His friends said he didnt seem intoxicated but he had drunk 7-12 beers in less than 45 minutes (got to the party at 11:06 PM, left the party at 11:45 PM), which is a lot of alcohol in a short amount of time, and it may not have hit him by the time he left, and some people are just very good at hiding how intoxicated they actually are, so my bet is that he was pretty drunk. Seems based on his computer activity that he made it back to his dorm and played some music on his computer (some songs had been skipped so someone was physically operating the computer), then maybe decided to go back to the party and either stumbled and fell in the lake or fell into it while urinating or something like that.\n\nThat said, a sentence in the Wikipedia article caught my eye: Leading up to November 2002, in the area around the Saint John's campus, male college students had been the subject of attacks (including attempted abductions) and stalkings. Male college students arent exactly the type you hear being frequent targets for attempted abductions. Josh wasnt a small guy, he was 60 and 175 pounds, you wouldnt think hed normally be an easy target but if drunk and off his guard, he might be. So I dont think foul play can be ruled out either.",

First out is Blekinge County in the south of Sweden.*\n\nThe administrative county covers exactly the same geographical area as the traditional Blekinge province and is made up of five municipalities. It's the lake-densest of all twenty-one counties and is located only a few hours away from Denmark. The capital of the region is Karlskrona, a World Heritage Site, which is spread across thirty islands.\n\n**THE VICTIM**\n\nThomas Karlsson is described as a lively, sweet and impulsive person but also someone who could become rowdy when he consumed alcohol. When he was under the influence, he liked to bicker, but according to his partner no more than any other average twenty-five-year-old.\n\n**THE MURDER**\n\nOn July 9th, Thomas is home with his newborn daughter in the village of Levalunda, Sweden, while his partner is with her younger brother and an aunt at Kar\u00f6n, a popular excursion destination during the summer. Kar\u00f6n is one of the largest islands in the Ronneby archipelago and is located around twelve minutes away from Levalunda by car.\n\nWhen the first police patrol arrives, Thomas is still conscious. He states that he had been resting in the bedroom when he heard noises from the kitchen door. When he went to investigate, he was hit with a blast from a shotgun. The shot traveled through a pane of glass in the door, but Thomas doesn\u2019t reveal who fired the gun. The police asks the question but they get no answer. A little later, Thomas passes away in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that Anna is away from home after giving birth to her daughter. Over the PA system, an Anna Gustafsson is called for, but since it's a common name, she doesn't think it's specifically her they mean. When the name is repeated, she still goes to check what it's about and is there met by the police. Anna's first thought is that Thomas has been involved in a car accident. Since he's impulsive, she wonders if he got behind the wheel after drinking alcohol. It wouldn't surprise her. The cops tell her that she can talk to Thomas herself when they meet at the hospital, but by the time she arrives it's too late. Thomas is dead.\n\n**SUSPECTS**\n\nA man aged twenty-eight is soon a suspect. The theory is that he has a connection to Anna - Thomas' partner - and that the motive is jealousy. While the suspect is being interrogated, a search is carried out in his residence. A shirt that is found is sent to SKL - the State's forensic laboratory - and according to the analysis, there is lead dust and glass fragments on the fabric.\n\nThe suspect denies any involvement and is never charged as apparently the evidence is too weak.\n\nThere is another man mentioned in the investigation as a person of interest and that is none other than Anna's father. His shotgun is missing and shotgun shells are found buried on his property. The father is also very nervous when talking to the police.\n\nTwo months later, Anna's father commits suicide. It should be noted that he was never arrested or charged with anything in connection to the murder.\n\nThe case is still unsolved today.\n\n  \n**Sources (in Swedish):**\n\n[https://polisen.se/aktuellt/kalla-fall/2018/december/thomas-karlsson/](https://polisen.se/aktuellt/kalla-fall/2018/december/thomas-karlsson/) \n\n[https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/7112993](https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/7112993) \n\n[https://www.blt.se/ronneby/polisen-oppnar-26-ar-gammalt-mordfall/](https://www.blt.se/ronneby/polisen-oppnar-26-ar-gammalt-mordfall/) \n\n",

            "An unresolved mystery I'm very familiar with. My sister lived (years later) in the same house he was shot in. We did not know the guy, but it was talked about a lot, especially in a small place like Levalunda. The house is in the middle of nowhere!",
            "What is Anna's father's motive?  And wouldn't Thomas recognize his own father in law and tell police it was him?",
            "So I assume the baby was left unharmed?",
            "Kunde varit lite lngre. Knns som om polisen borde kunnat lst det hr, litet samhlle, skjutvapen involverat och det r sannolikt troligt att motivet var ngon slags vendetta.",
            "Thank you for putting so much time into researching this case summary. The writing is excellent! I have never visited Sweden, so I am interested to see your descriptions of different parts of the country and the various cases you are going to cover.",
            "The lead and glass fragments is certainly suspicious, but without knowing anything else about the guy it's impossible to say anything else, there could be an entirely different reason he had lead and glass fragmenta on the shirt.\n\nThe missing shotgun and buried shotgun shells from the father in law is also suspicious. But again, nothing to go off of. Is it possible if he wasn't the killer he may have still being doing something illegal with the shotgun he didn't want to know? Did he have a history of depression before his death? What were the alibis of the two men?",
            "Anna had a newborn baby and was leaving the child for the first time ever. When she hears her name being called over the loud speaker she doesn't respond? WTH, I would have been there in a heartbeat concerned that something had happened to the baby!!!",
            "Did your sister ever feel creeped out when living there?",
            "Sounds like he was losing consciousness by the time police arrived. Also if it was dark or even if it wasnt but the perp had been wearing a mask or hood he may not have seen them at all.",
            "Yes, baby was left completely unharmed"
