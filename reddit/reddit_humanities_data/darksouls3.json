Not sure if my approach is bad but I can't stick with this. 10 hours on and off on \"best\" (/s) Dark Souls game is a little weird. Thing is I really enjoyed the start of DS1 and DS2. Not sure if maybe I'm burned out but I need some help to point me in right direction."

            "I'll start:\n\nNameless King 50 times\n\nMidir 20 times \n\nAbyss 15 times\n\nFirst time Abyss were so hard. My favorite bosses are Gael and Dragonslayer.",
            "Abyss around 10 times, the king around 25-30 and Midir is my lex Luther still haven't beaten him",
            "Namess king was the only boss I didnt manage to beat on my +2 lvl 11 build. I even managed to beat lothric legit in that run but nameless was just too much. \n\nMidir nr 2 fromsoftboss ever no questions asked.\n\nAbysswatchers is such an enigma for me. One time I absolutely wreck their shit and bully them to death and the other time they wreck my shit and bully me to death. Thank god they have about 1.69 poise bevause if they had more they's be significantly harder.",
            "Abyss Watchers 5 or 6 tries, really liked them.\n\nNameless King of course took me at least 50 tries. Dude mopped the floor with me.\n\nAnd Midir.... It's a complicated relationship. I absolutely hated him. There were some tries that i didn't even land a single hit. He took me at least 80 tries before I quit the game because of him. Then suddenly one day I came back and it clicked for me, you have to dance with his moves. Now he's one of my favourite bosses ever made.",
            "Nameless King is my favourite. He is difficult, beautiful and handsome. Also with a tragic and hard lore. I didn't count the tries on him, but it was somewhere around 30-40. This was the most interesting boss fight in the game.\n\nAs soon as I understood that the abbys guys fight each other I knew it would be an easy fight and it really was.\n\nI haven't tried Midir yet ;)",
            "Nameless King is still fun, one of the few bosses I come back to offer my sword to others\n\nAbyss Walkers are still annoying. Just one of the necessary bosses, but one that still surprise one-shots me\n\nMidir... fuck Midir.",
            "Abyss Watchers 1st try - They are fun but also fair, thanks to the mad one that also fights them. The second phase feels like a standard elite mob.\n\nMidir - Took me maybe 3-5 tries. I fought him like a Monster Hunter dragon, which made it pretty easy. I think he is the first and one of the few FromSoftware dragons that is actually fun to fight.\n\nNameless King took me a few more tries, probably around 10. After a few attempts, I was pissed because of his first phase. I still think he is cool to fight, but I hate the first phase. Even though it is pretty easy and fast to go through, it is still no fun.",
