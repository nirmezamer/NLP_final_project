        "content": "Hello /r/AnimeFigures, and welcome again to the Bootleg Megathread! \n\nPlease use this thread to post any and all questions you might have regarding counterfeit figures. **This includes questions such as \u201cIs my figure a bootleg?\u201d and \u201cCan I trust this seller?\u201d.**\n\nRemember to be as detailed as possible when asking for help. Provide clear pictures (ideally, multiple) or a link to the item you\u2019re looking to buy, depending on what you\u2019re asking. Let us know why you think this might be a bootleg, or why you don\u2019t trust this seller. Also keep in mind that different types of figures vary in quality. For example, a prize figure won't have the same level of detail or quality as a scaled figure.\n\nAs bootlegs are a serious problem for anyone who enjoys collecting, we are also happy to provide you with a few tips to spotting them yourselves. We encourage you guys to practice these tips before posting here. \n\n###For figures you already have:\n\n* Examine your retailer. Are they known to sell counterfeits? Keep in mind that all retailers on the sidebar are approved by /r/AnimeFigures, and do not sell bootlegs.\n\n* Was the price far lower then the current average?\n\n* Check MFC for known counterfeits. If a figure has any there will be [red text indicating so]( http://i.imgur.com/Pp0Dxqy.png) on that figure\u2019s listing. Click on the red text to see pictures of the bootleg. \n\n* Compare yours to the counterfeit and the **user pictures**- Do not compare yours to the prototype. (Comparison tip: Start with the hair. I usually find that the be the easiest place to spot differences!)\n\n* Look for poor quality paint jobs, materials, or sculpt work (lots of \"coloring outside the lines\", shiny skin, missing textures or gradients, ect).\n\n* Examine the box. Some bootleg boxes are [very easy to spot](http://myfigurecollection.net/picture/823998&amp;ref=category%3A3+item%3A166924), and some- [not so much](http://myfigurecollection.net/picture/514199&amp;ref=category%3A3+item%3A72522). Look for a [holo sticker](http://i.imgur.com/uzppfPF.jpg?1) of authenticity.\n\nPast Bootleg Megathreads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/search?q=bootleg+megathread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all), **for reference only**. Please be sure to only post in the current one.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n###For figures you're looking to buy:\n\n###General Tips:\n\n* Examine your retailer. Are they known to sell counterfeits? Keep in mind that all retailers on the sidebar are approved by /r/AnimeFigures, and do not sell bootlegs.\n\n* Is the price far lower then the current average?\n\n* Check item descriptions carefully. Bootlegs may be listed under fake brands rather than the known manufacturer. They may also contain descriptions like \"China version\" to avoid admitting that they are fake; similar weasel-word terms include \"hand-made\" (and its often-associated \"item size may vary\") and \"colors may differ on your screen\".\n\n* [Check MFC for a shop review listing.](http://myfigurecollection.net/shop/) \n\n\n###Ebay Checklist:\n\n####1. Price. \n* Again. Seriously, have I mentioned that yet? Insanely low prices should be throwing up some serious alert signals.\n\n####2. Look for pictures of the actual product, *that the seller took*.\n* A lot of sellers like to list their items with the official photos put out by the manufacturer. Check MFC if you're unsure of what you\u2019re looking at. If the pictures under \"official\" on MFC are the same as the ones on eBay, then they were not taken by the seller. Some sellers are just lazy and don't want to take pictures for every listing, but some use that as a trick to make you think you're getting an official item, when you're really going to get a bootleg. \n* When in doubt, ask the seller for pictures of the actual product. If they ignore you, or say they can't do that, move on to a different listing.\n\n####3. Check their feedback. \n* Look specifically for feedback where the buyer received a bootleg. This is usually going to be in the \"negative feedback\" section.\n\n####4. Check where it ships from. \n* eBay is really good about letting you know where an item is shipping from. If it ships from China, that's a bad sign.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n#Frequently Asked Bootleg Questions:\n####1. Is AliExpress a good website to buy from?\n* No, stay away from AliExpress. As far as figures are concerned, they *only* sell bootlegs.\n\n####2. How about Wish? And Mercari?\n* Wish appears to be nearly as bad as AliExpress in terms of bootleg frequency. User reports from Mercari depict a wide range of scenarios, with good sellers mixed in with people egregiously marking up their merchandise and more than a few bootlegs. Use with caution.\n\n####3. Is Amazon.com a good source for figures?\n* The increased use of the practice of [commingling inventory](https://blog.redpoints.com/en/amazon-commingled-inventory-management) has led to [an increase in the amount of counterfeit merchandise appearing on Amazon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/14/how-amazons-quest-more-cheaper-products-has-resulted-flea-market-fakes/). This increases the possibility of receiving a bootleg from them even if the seller appears to be otherwise trustworthy (even for \"shipped and sold by Amazon.com\"), and should be considered a reason to avoid them if possible. If one does choose to buy figures on Amazon, particularly with third-party sellers, apply the same criteria for price, seller photos, and deceptive descriptions as one would for a seller anywhere else, though the commingling issue will remain unless the item's path to the buyer is specified.  \nAmazon listings may copy images and descriptive text from other sites. Be particularly careful to check that the company in the \"Brand\" line matches the item's official producer, and watch for questionable text as mentioned above.\n\n####4. My Nintendo nendoroid/Figma has a white, square sticker, rather then the shiny oval one that can be found in the official pictures on MFC. Does that mean I have a bootleg?\n* No, the square sticker is also legitimate.\n\n###A Related Topic:\n\n* People often ask about the legitimacy and/or safety of a number of websites which sell large resin statues. The more commonly-asked of those deal primarily in resins from studios which do not have a license from the Japanese IP holders to produce merchandise. Therefore links to those sites are not permitted here. Another indicator is if [MyFigureCollection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) doesn't list the either the statue, its manufacturer, or the shop it's being sold on. While MFC does not list every legitimate item for various reasons, it does reject unlicensed ones.\n    __________________________\n\nPast Bootleg Megathreads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/search?q=bootleg+megathread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all), **for reference only**.

What\u2019s the best place to buy my anime figures from?**\n\nThat\u2019s going to depend a lot on what works for you, but most people around here buy them from Amiami, Big in Japan, Hobby Search, HobbyLink Japan, or Tokyo Otaku Mode. If none of those work for you for whatever reason, there\u2019s [a list of reputable retailers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/wiki/shops) in the sidebar that you can check out at any time. Be extra careful when ordering figures from websites like Amazon or ebay, as there are a lot of bootlegs on those sites. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask in our Bootleg Megathread if you\u2019re unsure.\n\n**2. What differences are there between the shipping options I get from most Japanese shops?**\n\nBelow is a rundown of the main shipping choices you\u2019ll get at most retailers. Keep in mind that if an order is large enough you will be forced to use one of the more expensive options, as SAL shipments have lower size and weight restrictions.\n\n* **Unregistered SAL:** Sometimes referred to as uSAL, is usually the cheapest method. It does not come with any tracking or insurance. Usually takes up 2-4 weeks for delivery.\n* **Registered SAL:** Sometimes referred to as rSAL, is insured for the declared value up to 6,000 yen. It comes with a tracking number and usually takes 2-4 weeks for delivery.\n* **EMS:** This method of shipping is much faster than either SAL options, usually arriving within a week of shipment. EMS shipments are insured for the declared value up to 2,000,000 yen.\n* **Airmail**\n* **E-packet**\n* **Surface:** Shops don't offer this very often. It's an actual cargo ship and slow as a result.\n\n* **DHL:** Becoming more available as an alternative to EMS on AmiAmi and other sites. Can be less expensive than EMS and of comparable speed, but may be more reliant on the specific geographical area being shipped to. The price is also determined by the size of the box. Offers their own tracking.\n\n**3. I placed two+ orders for figures at different times. Will my items be shipped together, or will I have to pay shipping twice?**\n\nMost shops will ask you to pay shipping on a per-order basis, but here are some that will allow combined shipping:\n\n* **Amiami:** You can combine orders here, as long as the orders ship in the same month. It doesn\u2019t matter if the item is new or preowned. Any preorders that are set for that month can also be combined with other orders for that month. However, be aware that if the preorder gets delayed, Amiami will remove that item from that month\u2019s shipment and place it on a new order. To combine orders on Amiami, use the \u201cCombine Orders\u201d feature under \u201cMy Account\u201d.\n\n* **Hobby Search:** Hobby Search will let you combine orders that release in the same month, but you cannot combine in stock items with preorders. If you want to combine multiple preorders, or multiple in stock items, you can do so using the \u201cOrder Recombination\u201d feature on your account page.\n\n* **HobbyLink Japan:** At HLJ, you have the option to send paid orders to their \u201cPrivate Warehouse\u201d, where you can store them for up to 2 months. When you\u2019re ready to ship the items, you simply select which items to ship and HLJ will combine them into one shipment for you. To use this, just select the \u201cPrivate Warehouse\u201d option as shipping when you order.\n\n*If you\u2019re unsure about whether or not a shop we haven\u2019t listed will combine your orders, please refer to their individual FAQs.*\n\n**4. When will I get charged for my preorder?**\n\nMost Japanese shops charge you once the item is in stock and ready for shipment. When that happens, they will send you an email asking for payment. Some shops (mostly overseas ones), will allow you to pay for the item up front though, if you\u2019d like. A few with that option are:\n\n* Big in Japan (Japanese store)\n* Tokyo Otaku Mode\n* Anime Island\n* Crunchyroll\n\nKeep in mind that overseas stores will likely get the figure a few months after Japanese ones, so pay attention to the release date stated on the website you are buying from so as to avoid that confusion.\n\n**5. Should I expect to pay customs fees when importing figures?**\n\nThat depends on where you live. Here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n* **Australia:** 10% GST is now assessed up front.\n* **Canada:** Minimum declared value for charges is around CAD$20 for regular shipments, and CAD$60 for gifts (gifting something only seems to lower the declared value by about CAD$40, not deplete it completely). When using Amiami, try their Small Air Packet option. It comes with tracking, gets there in about the same time as EMS, and is better at avoiding customs.\n* **European Union:** As of 1st July 2021, VAT has to be paid on all goods imported from outside of the EU. Retailers are supposed charge VAT for purchases under \u20ac150, however many Japanese retailers currently do not, so VAT will be charged when your order arrives in the EU. Orders that are >\u20ac150, VAT and duty will be charged by your local customs.\n* **UK:** As of 1st January 2021, VAT is to be charged by retailers for orders <\u00a3135. However, customs isn't currently charging VAT on parcels valued at <\u00a3135, even if the VAT hasn't been paid. Goods >\u00a3135 will have their VAT and duty calculated and charged by customs.\n* **Mexico:** Minimum declared value for customs fees is USD$300 for shipments by post, and USD$50 for shipments by courier.\n* **United States:** A shipment has to have a declared value of USD$2,000 before customs starts hitting you with fees, so you most likely won\u2019t have to worry about them at all.\n\n**6. The figure I want is an exclusive, how do I go about ordering one outside of Japan?** \n\nYou have three options for this:\n\n**A.** [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/) is known to stock exclusive figures and ship to other countries. Usually the price is higher because they build in their proxy fees, but it\u2019s easier than worrying about using a forwarder or proxy service. If you live in the US, [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/store), [Right Stuf](http://www.rightstufanime.com/), and [Tokyo Otaku Mode](http://otakumode.com/) also get exclusives sometimes, but out of the states the shipping can get expensive.\n\n**B.** Forwarding Services: A forwarder is someone who you ship an exclusive item to so that they can forward the package on to you, usually for a flat fee + shipping. When using a forwarder you still make the purchase yourself, and enter their address into the shipping field. When the box arrives at the forwarder they will then stick your address onto the package and send it on its way.\n\nSome popular forwarders are:\n\n* [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/en/content/16-forwarding-terms)\n* [Tenso](http://www.tenso.com/en/)\n\n*Be sure to read each sites instructions on forwarding carefully!*\n\n**C.** Proxy Services: With a proxy, you tell them what the item you\u2019re looking for is and they will purchase it in your stead. This is handy for when a company doesn\u2019t accept foreign credit cards, or you\u2019re having trouble navigating a Japanese website.\n\nSome popular proxies are:\n\n* [Big in Japan](http://biginjap.com/content/14-proxy) (Won\u2019t proxy for Yahoo Auctions)\n* [From Japan](http://www.fromjapan.co.jp/)    \n\n*Again, be sure you thoroughly read through each sites proxy instructions.*\n\n**7. I see a bunch of really cheap figures that ship from China on ebay. Are those okay to buy?**\n\nGenerally, no. They\u2019re most likely bootlegs. If you want a second opinion on that, feel free to ask in the Bootleg Megathread that\u2019s always stickied at the top of the sub.\n\n**8. What\u2019s a bootleg, and how can I avoid buying them?**\n\nA bootleg is a counterfeit figure often made using rejected molds of the official product. They are usually priced significantly lower than the genuine article, and in order to make their profit, bootleggers use lower quality materials and have less attention to detail- resulting in a substandard figure.\n\nThe Bootleg Megathread that I mentioned in question 7 is a great tool to avoid buying any bootlegs. It has a few tips and tricks to avoiding them to begin with, and a few more on how to spot them if you\u2019re worried you might already own one.\n\n**9. Does anyone know when figure X is going to be released? How do I know if it was delayed?**\n\n[My Figure Collection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) (sometimes referred to as MFC) does an excellent job of staying on top of information like release dates and delays. If you\u2019re curious about an upcoming figures release date, check there first. This information can be found [directly under the \u201cReleases\u201d section](http://i.imgur.com/8tOOdc2.png) on a figure\u2019s entry. If you only see a month and a year in that section, it means the release date has not yet been announced by the manufacturer, and there is still a chance the figure could be delayed.\n\nIf you make an account on MFC you can also subscribe to comments, changes, and pictures via a checkbox on the right hand side of a figure\u2019s listing. Subscribing to any of these things will allow MFC to send you an email anytime the subscription in question updates. Subscribing to \u201cchanges\u201d is a great way to keep up with release dates and delays, among other things.\n\n**10. The figure I want is long sold out at normal retailers! What\u2019s the best place to pick it up in the aftermarket?**\n\n[A list of reputable retailers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/wiki/shops) can be found under the \u201cShops\u201d section of the /r/AnimeFigures sidebar. They all sell legitimate products, and many of them also sell figures second hand. However, the most frequently suggested second hand sites are [Mandarake](http://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/) and [Amiami](http://amiami.com/)- who has [a preowned section](http://slist.amiami.com/top/search/list3?s_condition_flg=1&s_sortkey=preowned&pagemax=70&inctxt2=31) that they update every night save Sundays and Japanese holidays around 1PM JST and again around 6PM JST.\n\nAmiAmi grades their pre-owned items on a letter scale. The general consensus from buyers is that their ratings are conservative, so unless the item and/or packaging is specifically indicated as having significant flaws, pre-owned items from them are usually in at least as good a condition as their rating suggests.\n\n**Note:** *When you search Mandarake, you\u2019ll get the best results by using the Japanese characters for whatever you are searching. If you don\u2019t know them, you can find them on MFC by [clicking on any of the \u201cdetails\u201d in that figure\u2019s listing](http://i.imgur.com/rm5JcV5.png).*\n\n**11. Amiami has a figure I\u2019m interested in labeled as \u201cFor sale in Japan only\u201d. Does this mean I can\u2019t order it without a proxy or forwarder?**\n\nNo, you can still order it. Amiami\u2019s English site has that warning on many items, and it\u2019s mostly meant to inform you that this product was made for a Japanese market, and as such, will have Japanese speaking/writing in it- so don\u2019t expect any instructions to be in English. If Amiami doesn\u2019t want foreigners buying a certain product, they won\u2019t even list it on their English site.\n\n________________\n\n###Displaying Your Figures\n\n**12. What display cases do you recommend?**\n\nIf you live near an Ikea try out one of these:\n\n* [Klingsbo](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60128562/)\n* [Billy](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40279788/) (Often used with [Morliden doors](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30279755/) (now the [H\u00d6GBO](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hoegbo-glass-door-white-20517243/) and glass shelves.)\n* [Detolf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10119206/): Formerly the go-to choice for inexpensive display cabinetry, the Detolf was first made flimsier around 2020 and then essentially phased out of the name, to become the [BL\u00c5LIDEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/blaliden-glass-door-cabinet-black-00520519/). Knockoff versions of widely-varying quality are commonly found on other shopping sites these days, though.\n\n*If you decided on a Detolf, you might find that there is a lot of wasted space. Here are a few tutorials on raising the shelves or and adding extra ones in.\n\n* [Using metal clips](http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/tutorials-and-how-tos/423114-ikea-detolf-modification-adding-additional-shelves.html)\n* [Using acrylic supports and PVC pipe](http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1279)\n\nIf you don\u2019t live near an Ikea, [Amazon has a few display options](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_sc_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acurio+cabinet&keywords=curio+cabinet&ie=UTF8&qid=1434637271), though they are more expensive. Also keep an eye on your local Craigslist (or your country\u2019s equivalent) and stores near you that are closing up.\n\n**13. What lighting do you guys recommend?**\n\nIkea\u2019s Dioder LED strips were discontinued after a long run. A current version is the [Vattensten](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vattensten-led-light-strip-multicolor-80530604/), if you're inclined to buy your case and lights at the same time.\n\nLED strips have become very commonly available in recent years; most hardware and home furnishing stores carry a selection now. Just make sure that the lights don\u2019t get too hot!\n\n**14. What are those clear plastic boxes that I see under everyone\u2019s figures in their collection posts, and where can I get them?**\n\nThose are called risers. Most of us use standard acrylic risers like [these](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_sc_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aacrylic+risers&keywords=acrylic+risers&ie=UTF8&qid=1434482857). Some other, easy to find things that have been suggested are:\n\n* [Plastic picture cubes](http://i.imgur.com/ROTBHG8.jpg)\n* [Card Deck Boxes](http://i.imgur.com/qOQllVZ.jpg)\n* If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, [try making your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/3b6oy6/ranimefigures_faq/csjq88n)!\n\nCheck your local hobby store for the first 2 options, or your local hardware store if you want to make your own.\n\nAnother common suggestion is to visit [The Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm) if you have one near you. They have a lot of things to choose from that can suit a variety of needs. Be sure to check out their [standard acrylic risers](http://www.containerstore.com/shop/collections/display?productId=10019504&N=232&breadcrumbPageTitle=Search&mr=baseball+display), their [Amac boxes](http://www.containerstore.com/shop?productId=11000251&N=&Ntt=amac+boxes), and the various display cases they sell (baseball cases, mini car cases. hockey puck cases, etc).\n\n**15. Should I keep my figures sealed?**\n\nThat is, of course, up to you really, but here are a few things to keep in mind when debating this question:\n\n* **Keeping it sealed can actually damage your figure.** PVC figures usually have something called plasticizer in them, and that plasticizer needs to be able to breath. If a PVC figure isn\u2019t exposed to oxygen, after a period of time the plasticizer starts to break down and form a sticky substance on the surface of the figure. Simply opening your figures and taking them out of the box prevents this from happening. If you happen to find plasticizer goo on one of your figures, Kahotan has [a handy guide](http://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/2013/06/20/dealing-with-stickiness-on-figures/) for dealing with it.\n* Unlike some other figure markets, **keeping an anime figure sealed won\u2019t raise its value by a whole lot.** In fact, because of the plasticizer problem mentioned above, your figure could actually be in better condition if you open it versus keeping it sealed.\n\n____________________\n\n\n###Finding the Right Figure(s) for You\n\n**16. What are \"scales\" and \"prizes\"? What is the difference between them?**\n\nThose are classifications for figures based on a few factors.\n\n* \"Prizes\" are generally more simply produced figures which are intended to be given as prizes for playing arcade games. They are inexpensive and lack the detail of scale figures, though some prize figure lines have standouts which may approach lower-end scales in quality. That is uncommon and often depends on the individual figure.\n* \"Scales\" are called such because they are nominally designed to be proportional to the dimensions of the character which they are based on. They are generally of much better manufacture and materials than prize figures, allowing for more detail in painting, accessories, or complex poses.\n* \"Trading\" figures appear in gashapon machines or as blind boxes on shop counters, often as sets which include multiple characters. As suggested by the class name, the randomness encourages trading. They are usually very inexpensively-produced, though as with prizes, some series are better than others.\n* \"Non-scale\" encompasses a variety of other categories. It is often used to describe poseable figure lines such as figma and Nendoroids.\n\nIn recent years producers such as Good Smile Company attempted to further bridge the gap between prize quality and scales by introducing figure lines which are intended to be moderately-priced while retaining a higher level of detail than the typical prize figure, to varying levels of success.\n\n**17. There are so many figure companies! Who makes good figures?!**\n\nObviously this is a very subjective question, but as a general starting point, here are a few well renowned figure companies: \n\n* Alter\n* Max Factory\n* Good Smile Company\n* Kotobukiya (usually hit or miss for people. Use your best judgement based off of the prototype)\n* Flare\n* Stronger\n\n**18. I really love \u201cseries X / character X\u201d- how can I check if any figures were ever made for it?**\n\n[My Figure Collection](http://myfigurecollection.net/) can be your best friend here. Simply do a search on the name of the series or character using the search bar located at the top right of the screen, and all associated figures pop up!\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re looking at a figure\u2019s MFC entry, most of the text under the \u201cDetails\u201d section can be clicked on and used to run a search.\n\n**19. How can I commission a custom figure?**\n\nNone of the major figure companies (Alter, Kotobukiya, Good Smile Company, etc.) will take a commission for a single figure. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/35usjy/custom_figure_makers_that_take_commissions_and/) has a few websites in it that you can check out, or you can look into garage kits. Some kit painters would be willing to resculpt, frankenstein together, or otherwise modify kits for the right price.\n\nIf you're looking for help completing a garage kit, /r/brushforhire may be useful.\n\n_____________\n\n\n###Keeping Up with New Announcements\n\n**20. How can I keep up with figure news (announcements, updates, etc.)?**\n\nMost people use a MFC combined with any or all of the following news sites:\n\n* [Neko Magic](http://www.nekomagic.com/)\n* [Alter\u2019s Blog](http://blog.livedoor.jp/alter_info/) (In Japanese)\n* [Kahotan\u2019s Blog](http://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/) (Only GSC and their sister companies)\n\nMany figure companies are active on Twitter, so following them there is recommended for quicker news.\n\nTo use MFC for this I\u2019ll quote question #9.\n\n> If you make an account on MFC you can also subscribe to comments, changes, and pictures via a checkbox on the right hand side of a figure\u2019s listing. Subscribing to any of these things will allow MFC to send you an email anytime the subscription in question updates. Subscribing to \u201cchanges\u201d is a great way to keep up with release dates and delays, among other things.\n\nMost companies have one or more Twitter accounts. Some examples: [Good Smile Company sales](https://twitter.com/gsc_sales), [Good Smile's USA branch](https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US), [Max Factory](https://twitter.com/MXF_official), [AmiAmi Hobby News](https://twitter.com/amiamihobbynews).\n\n**21. Everyone\u2019s excited about something called Wonfes\u2026.. what the heck is that?!**\n\nWonFes (short for Wonder Festival) is a biannual figure expo where many figure producers (both large and small) show off new sculpts and updates to figures already under way. Most companies save their most exciting announcements for WonFes, so we all look forward to the expo whenever it rolls around! Winter Wonder Festival is usually held in February, while Summer Wonder Festival is usually in July. The event has also spread to Shanghai, in the late spring.\n\n**22. One or two (or 15) figures were announced at WonFes that I\u2019m really excited about! How can I keep track of their progress once the event is over?**\n\nMFC is always really quick about getting new WonFes announcements (or any others throughout the year, for that matter) listed in their database, so we suggest using that. To find a figure from the event you can search any number of things, including the name of the character or the name of the show. You can also use the tag search to search \u201cWonder_Festival_ 20xx_[season]\u201d to see all items announced at that event.",

            "How many figures does Amiami's Surface mail fit?",
            "Depends on the figure like where it was manufactured, how retailers procure their figures, and where you get it from. If it's from Amiami, u usually get it at the earliest \\[most cases\\], if it's other retailers then it'll vary, the time that is and if you ship it from China, then you are most likely to get it a month early but it depends on the figure in the end. Some are Japan-exclusive which means that u most likely will not get it from China and thus like everyone else the retailers from China will also take time to procure them. And, in your case... it looks like the retailers don't know when it'll arrive at their warehouse, they usually have specific months of when the figure will be released and if not then no one can say, check their official page, it will have that unless ur in China where they have pre-orders for 'in-production' figures. The release date of figures is always tentative and if the retailers say q1 and q1 then it will most likely release then unless the manufacturer comes upon some kind of technical difficulties.",
