        "content": "My friend and I where always very firm in wanting to be child-free. From childhood to now in our late 20's. We always disliked kids and joked about how gross blowout diapers and sticky kids having tantrums at stores where, especially when we saw someone we knew from school posting stuff like that, and always said we'd never have a \"crotch goblin.\" We didn't find babies or children cute, we where always very strong in out distaste for them, and I still feel this way.\n\nWell, fast forward to a 2020, when my friend found out she was pregnant. Initially, she was opposed to having a child, but after a few days, decided she wanted to go through with it. Of course, I'm going to support whatever choice she made as long as it was something she's happy about, but as time went on, her attitude towards children and babies changed dramatically.\n\nThe first time I noticed was when she showed me an ultrasound picture and said something like \"look how adorable he is!\" Before, we used to talk about how we just didn't get why ultrasound pics where cute when you could barely see anything. Soon, she was showing me baby clothes/outfits and photos of herself and her husband as babies, as she was excited to see if the baby looked like that.\n\nNow, to be clear, I'm very happy for my friend and I'm glad she has a happy family. What irritates me is her thinking my opinions on kids changed as well. \n\nOnce the baby was born, she started going on about how she was excited about me having a baby someday and them being friends with her son and now jokes about the \"cute\" blowout diapers and potty training on her socials. When this was something we both found gross before.\n\nThe baby is now a toddler who is difficult to be around when we try to meet up (ie constantly demanding to be held or needing to be walked around because they can't sit still; she thinks it's cute and funny. I find it draining)\n\nHas anyone else experienced this big of a shift with someone they know? I still have no interest in having children, but because her views have changed, she thinks mine magically did too. Again, I'm happy her, and l'm not looking for any kind of advice. Its just crazy how much she's changed. Not sure if it maternal instinct or what.",

I mean there\u2019s a moms who want babies and loved babies since forever that struggle immensely having it. Expecting everything to be perfect after having a baby is simple unrealistic and it isn\u2019t the same for everyone. Have you reminded her that you still don\u2019t like babies and kids?",

I feel like you should leave the baby with a family member unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency. Children that young cannot comprehend the ear popping, and it is also extremely painful for them. They can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on and only know they\u2019re in pain. This feels immoral to the baby and the people on the plane.

I'm not kidding when I say at 2am there were a couple of women with collectively 6 kids under 7 between them, all the kids running, screaming at the top of their lungs, playing tag and darting in and out of the seats. The mums did nothing, sweet fuck all, one went flying and head butt the concrete, a little girl just absolutely screamed ear piercingly loud, it was that bad other passengers started trying to tell the kids off and yelled at the parents to control their kids. Nothing changed, they let this happen for HOURS!! I was beside myself, there is no way on god's earth they thought they were good parents, like I can't fathom it. \n\nI don't care about well behaved kids 5 and up, I can even understand the crying because fuck I wanted to cry with the delay. But in my opinion if you are raising brats and you know it, don't make it everyone else's problem, and if you have kids under 4 surely it's selfish because there's no way they can even remember where you're taking them anyway, so you've burdened everyone else just to have to talk to the kid about the memory later as if they weren't there anyway \"when you were three we did ___\" like why!! If you've got small kids, make people visit you unless you absolutely can't.

I also understand that there are emergencies, and sometimes you have to do it.\n\nBut what would terrify me if i was a parent, is all the unvaccinated people that could be around and potentially give my kid a horrible, deadly disease. Especially if the kid is too young to be immunized. Those planes and some passengers are NASTY, and i wouldn\u2019t want a child with a developing immune system to be anywhere near that.
