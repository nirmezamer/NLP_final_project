We are trying to work from home completely. Not so se can travel, but to just chill and drive less. We want a bigger place so we can have separate offices and rooms to do out activities in. It will take time, but we can get there without kids. \n\nI love working from home, I know some parents hate it, but my home is clean and quiet and I love it.",

I did feel bad because mom was also crying towards the end (but only holding baby w one hand so she could record the tiktok lol) most of the comments were supporting her saying how hard it must be- but in my opinion is this not kinda selfish ? I feel like you should leave the baby with a family member unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency. Children that young cannot comprehend the ear popping, and it is also extremely painful for them. They can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on and only know they\u2019re in pain. This feels immoral to the baby and the people on the plane. I personally am autistic and would have been in tears if a baby was wailing my entire flight. But I\u2019m just wondering- what are your thoughts ? ",

            "I do think it's selfish, especially if you are filming it and then uploading it to the internet to garner sympathy for a choice you made. Unless it's super extenuating circumstances, it's torture for the kid and for the other couple hundred or so passengers.",
            "When my SIL's kid was about 5 months old she flew several times with her baby, rich older family members are easier to fleece of money, she 'loves' being able to travel and didn't want her flyer points to go to waste because now she had a kid.\n\nI remember one time that she bragged about the first flight with her baby who immediately went to sleep before take off and didn't wake up at all.\n\nMy brother, who was in a bad mood at the time, suddenly spoke up and said something I cannot forget:\n\n'Yeah that's because you doped the kid up with that stuff you bought!'",

But the fact that she was trying to validate her choices of taking a baby on a plane irked me even more. If it was an emergency I doubt she would have been filming! But then again, I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t think logically after having a baby in general. Still it was weird.",
            "I think it\u2019s a horrible experience for the kid, more so when travelling through time zones. I also understand that there are emergencies, and sometimes you have to do it.\n\nBut what would terrify me if i was a parent, is all the unvaccinated people that could be around and potentially give my kid a horrible, deadly disease. Especially if the kid is too young to be immunized. Those planes and some passengers are NASTY, and i wouldn\u2019t want a child with a developing immune system to be anywhere near that. One person with whooping cough is all that takes.",
            "You've caught me at a bad time, I've literally just walked in from a flight that was supposed to have me home 5 hours ago but thanks to delays have only just walked through the door. I'm not kidding when I say at 2am there were a couple of women with collectively 6 kids under 7 between them, all the kids running, screaming at the top of their lungs, playing tag and darting in and out of the seats. The mums did nothing, sweet fuck all, one went flying and head butt the concrete, a little girl just absolutely screamed ear piercingly loud, it was that bad other passengers started trying to tell the kids off and yelled at the parents to control their kids. Nothing changed, they let this happen for HOURS!! I was beside myself, there is no way on god's earth they thought they were good parents, like I can't fathom it. \n\nI don't care about well behaved kids 5 and up, I can even understand the crying because fuck I wanted to cry with the delay. But in my opinion if you are raising brats and you know it, don't make it everyone else's problem, and if you have kids under 4 surely it's selfish because there's no way they can even remember where you're taking them anyway, so you've burdened everyone else just to have to talk to the kid about the memory later as if they weren't there anyway \"when you were three we did ___\" like why!! If you've got small kids, make people visit you unless you absolutely can't. They can't comprehend what's going on and it's a long time to sit still for hours at that age, most adults struggle with it let alone someone who hasn't got the brain development to identify colours yet."
