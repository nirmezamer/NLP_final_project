            "So, if *Advanced* Phantom Cage is for level 80-120, how am I supposed to get 1.000.000 points to claim the mentor mission  before graduation?",
            "why is bianca called balter?",
            "Is there a spending guide for voucher shop? I notice some S ranks I dont have, have shards there. What decides what s ranks are added there? Also is it even possible to save up enough vouchers to unlock one just through voucher shop? Just looking at the voucher income from events it doesn't feel like a lot.",
            "When does the debut S rank enter the blue ticket banner?",
            "I read the Gray Ravens website to understand a lot of things about the game, and one of those is team building. I want to ask, generally, is it always better to make one team with mono-ele than making a \"rainbow\" team as a newbie? since I don't think I can fill it out right away (make sense), and in what content besides Warzone and Pain Cage does this mono-ele team matter? thanks.",
            "So... I started playing today and I only have Noctis aside from the other 3 you get for free. I haven't used any selector yet and I'm saving all my BC even tho I really wanted Bianca but I saw that we will be getting a way to select the S-rank from the beginners banner. Basically I wanted to know who should I pick from my S and A-rank free selectors to have a solid starting team that I could use for story mode, events and anywhere where I could squeeze some rewards early on. Also, should I keep pulling on the standard banner until I get a random S-rank and then wait for the S-rank selector or should I just wait? Do we get a lot of standard pull so I can get the 40 Pity and then 60 from now until we get the selector?\n\nBy the way, I'm sorry if I said something wrong, English is not my first language, thanks in advance.",
            "I don't have Feral scent, Garnet nor do I have CW. Who's a better lightning dps Veritas or Noctis? I was told Veritas but the person who told me seemed to be Bianca's strongest soldier.",
            "How do I bind my account to Facebook/Google? It's one of the tasks and I can't figure out how to do it, I click advance and it sends me to the account settings, I look around and there's no button that I can press to bind my account. Sorry if my grammar is wrong.",
            "At what rank does Alisa become stronger than SS Bianca? \n\nAlso, should I SSS Alisa or Ayla? They're both SS3 right now.",
            "Need help\n\nI'm lvl86 and I can't say I understand the game. How do y'all play it? What do you do routinely?\n\nI look at others' units and they have 12 different SSS+... How do yall get to that point for all your units?? I only have 1 SS at 5000power and a couple of S's at 4000power. What am I doin wrong? Can yall give some tips.\n\nI mostly spend my daily stamina to get the memories I want for my units and enchancing them as much as I can by spending my stamina the next day for resources"

            "Zero's secret revealed that Purification Force used lotteries to pick their target. For some reason Bianca always got Watanabe. So maybe she got tired of seeing him? Especially when he's the only one who knew of her past. Makes things awkward between them.",
            "i dont know either",
            "I thought it was the other way around. Bianca dislikes Watanabe, but Watanabe has nothing against Bianca.",
            "According to Watanabe, Bianca was still kind of crazy after what she did so it was a hassle for him to deal with her",
            "I won't say hate but more like awkward dislike. Maybe due to their past and position, Bianca are Purifier Force leader while Watanabe are leader of Forsaken. Despite always try to get at each other ass, they are fully capable of working together like in chapter 5-7, Guin memo rescue and Golden Vortex."
