            "Karlach. Bull always dies almost immediately in any moderately hard fight.",
            "If we're talking an arena fight with equal kit, probably Iron Bull. He seems the better tactician, while both seem relatively equal in strength. Reaver vs Hell Furnace is either a wash or favors Bull. \n\nIf we're talking full kit from original universe, Karlach and it's not even close. DnD gear gets stupid."
