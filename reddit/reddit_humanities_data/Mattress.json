I don\u2019t really have a budget in mind just want something great that will last. Seeing a lot of ads for nectar for pretty cheap. Makes me wonder why. What are the brands I should be looking at?  Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you. ",

            "Nectar is generally considered one of the main [brands to avoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/qo3t73/lets_talk_about_brands_to_avoid/) around here. They make a cheap mattress sourced out of China and they are not consistent with suppliers. Just google opinions of Nector on Reddit and you have to search hard to find the positive mentions. Just countless people pissed off their mattress shed fiberglass all over their room and started sagging after 6 months.",
            "Nectar is super poor quality. Online bed-in-a-box brands are all pretty meh in my opinion. I personally believe that you can get a wayy better quality mattress at lower cost by buying local.\n\nWhen I say local, I don\u2019t mean mattress firm (which also blows). Find some family run operation or a local mattress factory. They don\u2019t need to have a slick e-commerce site. They don\u2019t need to advertise any copper-infused graphite crystal diamond foam BS. Local made mattresses don\u2019t have freight costs baked into the price either.\n\nI really really encourage you to go check out a local mattress company. It\u2019s the better value when it comes to mattresses.",
            "It's hit or miss. Some people love them, others hate them. Try it before you buy.",
            "So basically none of the online mattress companies are trustworthy? Is their one that might be reputable? Ugh I feel like they all have the same interface on their site I\u2019m like overwhelmed but confused at the same time. I don\u2019t wanna spend $1500+ and get ripped off.",
            "It\u2019s not like they\u2019re scams. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a great value in general. Free nationwide shipping costs $$. Marketing teams and fancy branding costs $$. Etc etc.\n\nThere are tons of options out there. Fortunately most all of them have solid return policies. \n\nI\u2019d still maintain that local is the better route for mattresses.. you can try out the mattress, it will likely be a superior construction (it doesn\u2019t need to compress into a box), and it will likely be cheaper.\n\nI tried a handful from Costco, purple, mattress firm, etc. and ended up going with some local mattress store. Their website looked like it was from the 90s. Zero instagram ads. It was some old-school 3rd or 4th generation family operation. It ended up being exactly what I was looking for. I was willing to spend upwards of $4-$5k for a mattress and I ended up spending $2k for my ideal king size.\n\nIf I did online, I\u2019d look through this list: \n\nhttps://mattressunderground.com/the-underground/our-trusted-members",
            "Thank you so much for the thoughtful reply. Gonna check out the link you sent! Will likely try to get into a physical store but not a mattress firm or store like that lol",
            "Of course. Obviously location plays a big influence on options though. Are you in a midsize/major metro area?"

            "Combo sleepers have the most difficult time mattress shopping because they need a mattress that is soft enough to provide enough pressure relief for sleeping on their side, while also firm enough so that they dont develop back pain from poor spinal alignment while sleeping on either their back and/or stomach. Stomach sleeping requires the firmest of the three, and is generally not a recommended sleep position because of the stress it puts on your back, neck, and spine. \n\nThe best route to go is to lay down on mattresses at a store, and figure out what firmness level works best for you. This will take a good amount of time because you need to give each sleep position enough time to feel pressure point issues arising or tightness developing on your back."

Does anyone else have this problem? Why is it so amazing and then suddenly it\u2019s hell??",
