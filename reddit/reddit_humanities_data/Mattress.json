        "content": "I bought my $10k bed in September.  Have replaced the footwarmers twice, the core recently and the install was done wrong (apparently the third guy called it out).  I called asking them to extend the full warranty or take the bed back - arrogant customer service rep says they won\u2019t do that and there is no one at sleep number that can do that.  I challenged that someone needs to be in a position to consider, nope.  I asked if this is what sleep number customers should expect and he would not answer the question - kept saying \u2018is there anything I can help you with on the bed at this time\u2019?\n\nSeriously, high cost product with zero true customer support.  Techs they send out smell like weed and do a shotty job.  \n\nSave yourself a headache or two (and thousands)",

I don\u2019t really have a budget in mind just want something great that will last. Seeing a lot of ads for nectar for pretty cheap. Makes me wonder why. What are the brands I should be looking at?  Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you. ",

            "If you're in Chicago (I am) hit up My Green Mattress. Similar vibe to what this poster suggests, but it's in your neighborhood. We chose the firmest and stuck a memory foam on top of it and it's just amazing. You can also go lay on the beds, and they will deliver and set it up in your house. I think they have a 10 year warranty too."

        "content": "Hi!\n\nI just moved to a furnished new apartment, and I've discovered that the bed is slightly shorter than the one I was used to (before it was 200x160cm now it is 190x140). My height is 184cm.\n\nThe landlord does not want to change the bed and mattress because both are new (they bought them just before I entered the apartment).\n\nSo I'm wondering if any solution exist to have a 10cm longer bed.\n\nThe first solution that come to my mind is using a 200x140 topper to put over the mattress and which will go over the end part of the bed.\n\nThe second is to somehow extend the bed box (which supports the bedspring) 10 cm and then somehow fill the missing 10cm gap in the mattress\n\nThird and most expensive and difficult to do is buy a new bed, dismantle the old one and put all its component in the box under the new bed (so that to be able to reassembly the landlord bed when I'll leave the apartment.\n\nIn the latter case the issue is finding a new bed with a big enough box beneath to store the 190x140 mattress, the bedspring, the parts of the landlord's bed structure.\n\nWhat you suggest me to do?\n\nIn the first case can a topper increase the rigidity of the mattress?\n\nIn the second case, can you tell me what I could use to extend the bed box?\n\n",
