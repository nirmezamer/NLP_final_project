        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nAs we settle into the backend of the sub, I thought it fair and proper to provide you with some insight as to what we have been doing:\n\n1. We have put up disclaimers, notes, and alerts just about everywhere we can stating that this sub is not a replacement for actual legal advice, and you should make important decisions based on information you get here. We are emphasizing that even though we are stuck with the name r/AskALawyer , it is not to be taken literally. r/AskLawyers may be a viable alternative if you literally want to talk to lawyers, but please be cool to them over there if you do check them out. **From here on out, consider this sub to be \"Ask a Legal Enthusiast\"** \n2. We created, modified, and eliminated some rules. There's nothing there this is new in the sense that it is something we wouldn't have moderated before, but it now just more visible for the sake of full disclosure. Still working the text/definitions/standards for them, but you should be able to get the gist.\n3. We created....a lot...of bots that will supply you with helpful messages, prohibit some problematic posting, and automatically send items for review based on keywords. The one everyone will see is going to be Location Bot, which will flag any message title that does not have brackets in it with a reminder to post a location. There's a bunch of other ones based on common issues/phrases. This will likely cut down on the *quantity* of new posts but ultimately increase the *quality* of posts that do get made.\n   1. **NOTE:** *If you encounter anything weird with these, please let us know via mod mail or here. For some reason mods do not get to see the automations when they are pushed to go live. We really do want feedback on how these help/hinder the experience*\n4. We turned on some Reddit harassment, ban evasion, and quality control tools. We'll see how these work and if they make sense to keep on, given that people tend to make throwaways for a lot of content here. Modmail is also filtered for harassment so whatever expletive you want to throw our way for daring to moderate you probably won't ever be seen by a human.\n5. We turned on automod that provides links to other legal subs people may be interested it - especially for our friends outside the US. Still working out what we want automod to say/do.\n6. For the time being, there are no user flairs to denote \"Verified Lawyer\" or \"Not A Lawyer\". We think we turned off all the flairs, but they seem to be showing up from time to time still on new posts so who knows if we actually did. Point is, those flairs are going away. Please don't ask us for them. Appropriate replacements will come eventaully, once we get things going.\n7. u/athena5000 is hard at work doing some design updates to the sub and I trust their very capable hands to do what they feel is best in that department. If you have any thoughts or comments, please let us know.\n\nSo there we have it folks. If you have any ideas, thoughts, feedback, please feel free to reach out in the comments below or via mod mail. Constructive criticism is welcome.",

        "content": "My wife works as a speech therapist and works closely with patients that have had strokes, brain injuries, and other cognitive issues. \n\nShe is about 10 weeks pregnant and just found out yesterday that one of the patients she's been working with closely for several weeks has been taking aggressive radiotherapy for a nasty cancerous brain tumor. The patient has had the brain tumor for the entirety of his stay and treatment on my wife's floor.\n\nShe was just informed of this yesterday. One of the occupational therapists mentioned this and said that \"only pregnant women need to worry about the levels of radiation he's emitting\". \n\nMy wife had not yet told anyone other than her boss that she's pregnant due to her only being 10 weeks along, but had to tell everyone now that she's been exposed to this patient (her telling people is basically a non-issue in relation to the radioactive patient she's been seeing). She also is refusing to see him now which everyone agrees is the best option.\n\n We have called our OBGYN office, and they seemed concerned. They will be referring to our Dr. soon. \n\nMy legal question, and maybe it's too soon to know, but if something happens to the baby, how likely would we be able to make a case against the hospital? What kind of lawyer would we reach out to? Obviously all of this is fairly new and is ongoing, but I'm just curious what our next steps would be if something happens.\n\nEdit: because people are mentioning it in the comments, my wife did disclose her pregnancy to her boss prior to this patient coming to her floor. I should have made that more clear. I'm not sure how else she could have \"let the hospital know\" if this doesn't count.\n\nEdit2: some information I feel is relevant after seeing some comments...\n\nThe floor my wife works on is in-patient. It's where they go after they've been deemed medically stable, but can't go home due to their injury and need some kind of physical, occupational, or cognitive therapy. \n\nThey adopt an \"it's everyone's job\" mentality, meaning if my wife is in the middle of a session and the patient needs to use the bathroom, she is the one who physically transfers them.\n\nHer sessions are at minimum an hour a day every day. She works four consecutive days a week.\n\nWhen she told her boss, she signed paperwork that stated she was pregnant and was disclosing that to the hospital at large, but due to it being so recent and new hadn't told her coworkers. I just learned the paperwork bit from my wife just now.\n\nThis is our first child and first time being pregnant.\n",

            "There are medical journals and articles that discuss chemotherapy patients. They even state physical contact is fine and safe. It also discusses whether or not patients are implanted with radiation or getting it intravenously and the variance in such. Your wife can request accommodation to not see or treat stated patient due to pregnancy if she is that concerned.\n\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-your-cancer-treatment-be-hazardous-to-others",
            "brains are generally treated with stereotactic radiation. the beam is a massive radiation dose generated with electricity, it\u2019s not like a radioactive isotope that is always giving off radiation. it ends when the patient gets off the table of the machine.",
            "NAL but a medical physicist\n\nBased on your description the likely situation is that the patient isn't radioactive at all.\n\nIf the patient was / is radioactive and emitting the levels of radiation that could in any way approach being any sort of concern the hospital will have been required to have them in isolation under the conditions of thier radioactive materials license.\n\nI don't have time to write an extensive response but the TLDR is that radioactivity and radioactive patients are highly regulated by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nMost likely there is confusion and this patient is undergoing external beam radiation therapy which does not make them radioactive and your wife is being given bad information.",
            "I just wanted to chime in that a lot of people are saying radiation therapy does not cause a patient to emit radiation, however there is a type of therapy called brachytherapy where radioactive \"seeds\" are implanted following neurosurgical resection of a brain tumor (brand name Gammatile). These DO emit radiation for around d 100 days following implantation, with a total exposure around 0.9 mSv for close contact caregivers who routinely interact with the patient, which is well below accepted safety standards. HOWEVER it is recommended that pregnant individuals do NOT engage in close contact with the patient during that 100 day window. \n\n[Gammatile](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acm2.13776#:~:text=measured%20dose%20rates.-,Results,skull%20and%20soft%20tissue%20attenuation.)",
            "Something is missing here. I work in a similar setting, and any restrictions for who can work with a patient are known.  We had a similar situation with a patient on isolation and staff needed to not be pregnant. I\u2019m older than my colleagues. Manager still checked in with me explaining the pregnancy restriction, not knowing my own medical history that I can\u2019t get pregnant anymore (tubal ligation).  I shared I was the safest person to work with this patient just in case a younger colleague was pregnant and didn\u2019t know it yet. \n\nSo either the radiation isn\u2019t as strong as your wife was told and there\u2019s no risk,  or your wife\u2019s work has a huge safety issue that needs to be reported",
            "(Echoing other comments...) Please clarify (exactly) what sort of treatment this patient had? Radiation therapy? If so, what sort of therapy? \n\nRadioisotope therapy? (If so, what isotope?)\n\nThat will help...",

            "I'd think it'd be workers comp, if she/her fetus suffer health complications from something she encountered at her workplace while she was working. She could document what happened in an incident report, reporting that she's been working with the patient, there were no warnings/notices at the patient's room/medical chart, etc.",
            "I would think her chart would be prominently marked if the pt themself was a hazard. You could ask a radiation oncologist, but they\u2019re not going to speak to you unless you\u2019re referred to them. And they\u2019re not going to accept the referral because you don\u2019t have cancer. Your obstetrician will make the proper referrals, most likely to a maternal fetal medicine unit.  They will do a thorough assessment and then take the proper actions that are based on best practices."
