        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nAs we settle into the backend of the sub, I thought it fair and proper to provide you with some insight as to what we have been doing:\n\n1. We have put up disclaimers, notes, and alerts just about everywhere we can stating that this sub is not a replacement for actual legal advice, and you should make important decisions based on information you get here. We are emphasizing that even though we are stuck with the name r/AskALawyer , it is not to be taken literally. r/AskLawyers may be a viable alternative if you literally want to talk to lawyers, but please be cool to them over there if you do check them out. **From here on out, consider this sub to be \"Ask a Legal Enthusiast\"** \n2. We created, modified, and eliminated some rules. There's nothing there this is new in the sense that it is something we wouldn't have moderated before, but it now just more visible for the sake of full disclosure. Still working the text/definitions/standards for them, but you should be able to get the gist.\n3. We created....a lot...of bots that will supply you with helpful messages, prohibit some problematic posting, and automatically send items for review based on keywords. The one everyone will see is going to be Location Bot, which will flag any message title that does not have brackets in it with a reminder to post a location. There's a bunch of other ones based on common issues/phrases. This will likely cut down on the *quantity* of new posts but ultimately increase the *quality* of posts that do get made.\n   1. **NOTE:** *If you encounter anything weird with these, please let us know via mod mail or here. For some reason mods do not get to see the automations when they are pushed to go live. We really do want feedback on how these help/hinder the experience*\n4. We turned on some Reddit harassment, ban evasion, and quality control tools. We'll see how these work and if they make sense to keep on, given that people tend to make throwaways for a lot of content here. Modmail is also filtered for harassment so whatever expletive you want to throw our way for daring to moderate you probably won't ever be seen by a human.\n5. We turned on automod that provides links to other legal subs people may be interested it - especially for our friends outside the US. Still working out what we want automod to say/do.\n6. For the time being, there are no user flairs to denote \"Verified Lawyer\" or \"Not A Lawyer\". We think we turned off all the flairs, but they seem to be showing up from time to time still on new posts so who knows if we actually did. Point is, those flairs are going away. Please don't ask us for them. Appropriate replacements will come eventaully, once we get things going.\n7. u/athena5000 is hard at work doing some design updates to the sub and I trust their very capable hands to do what they feel is best in that department. If you have any thoughts or comments, please let us know.\n\nSo there we have it folks. If you have any ideas, thoughts, feedback, please feel free to reach out in the comments below or via mod mail. Constructive criticism is welcome.",

I haven't owned much less used a gun before. also now my wife is mad that I didn't call the police right after. \n\nsummary of questions:\n1. can I keep this gun?\n2. if no, how do I get rid of it? sell to a gun shop?\n3.

        "content": "My wife works as a speech therapist and works closely with patients that have had strokes, brain injuries, and other cognitive issues. \n\nShe is about 10 weeks pregnant and just found out yesterday that one of the patients she's been working with closely for several weeks has been taking aggressive radiotherapy for a nasty cancerous brain tumor. The patient has had the brain tumor for the entirety of his stay and treatment on my wife's floor.\n\nShe was just informed of this yesterday. One of the occupational therapists mentioned this and said that \"only pregnant women need to worry about the levels of radiation he's emitting\". \n\nMy wife had not yet told anyone other than her boss that she's pregnant due to her only being 10 weeks along, but had to tell everyone now that she's been exposed to this patient (her telling people is basically a non-issue in relation to the radioactive patient she's been seeing). She also is refusing to see him now which everyone agrees is the best option.\n\n We have called our OBGYN office, and they seemed concerned. They will be referring to our Dr. soon. \n\nMy legal question, and maybe it's too soon to know, but if something happens to the baby, how likely would we be able to make a case against the hospital? What kind of lawyer would we reach out to? Obviously all of this is fairly new and is ongoing, but I'm just curious what our next steps would be if something happens.\n\nEdit: because people are mentioning it in the comments, my wife did disclose her pregnancy to her boss prior to this patient coming to her floor. I should have made that more clear. I'm not sure how else she could have \"let the hospital know\" if this doesn't count.\n\nEdit2: some information I feel is relevant after seeing some comments...\n\nThe floor my wife works on is in-patient. It's where they go after they've been deemed medically stable, but can't go home due to their injury and need some kind of physical, occupational, or cognitive therapy. \n\nThey adopt an \"it's everyone's job\" mentality, meaning if my wife is in the middle of a session and the patient needs to use the bathroom, she is the one who physically transfers them.\n\nHer sessions are at minimum an hour a day every day. She works four consecutive days a week.\n\nWhen she told her boss, she signed paperwork that stated she was pregnant and was disclosing that to the hospital at large, but due to it being so recent and new hadn't told her coworkers. I just learned the paperwork bit from my wife just now.\n\nThis is our first child and first time being pregnant.\n",

            "brains are generally treated with stereotactic radiation. the beam is a massive radiation dose generated with electricity, its not like a radioactive isotope that is always giving off radiation. it ends when the patient gets off the table of the machine.",
            "Something is missing here. I work in a similar setting, and any restrictions for who can work with a patient are known.  We had a similar situation with a patient on isolation and staff needed to not be pregnant. Im older than my colleagues. Manager still checked in with me explaining the pregnancy restriction, not knowing my own medical history that I cant get pregnant anymore (tubal ligation).  I shared I was the safest person to work with this patient just in case a younger colleague was pregnant and didnt know it yet. \n\nSo either the radiation isnt as strong as your wife was told and theres no risk,  or your wifes work has a huge safety issue that needs to be reported",
            "Info: Was your wife not aware of why the patient was at the hospital? Does she not see any of the records?",
            "I would advise you to seek the advice of a health physicist (a professional who advises people/institutions on radioactive hazards and their mitigation) and go from there. I personally think the risks to your child's health are quite low given the scenario you've stated, but if it will help you both to put your minds at ease, it might'be worth your while. The fact that the patient involved was \"walking the earth\" is a good indicator that his risk to others was very low since people who are undergoing therapy that leaves them with a great deal of reactivity are usually isolated. I'm not a doctor, but I have worked with patients undergoing radiotherapy so, take that into account and seek professional advice.",
            "I would think her chart would be prominently marked if the pt themself was a hazard. You could ask a radiation oncologist, but theyre not going to speak to you unless youre referred to them. And theyre not going to accept the referral because you dont have cancer. Your obstetrician will make the proper referrals, most likely to a maternal fetal medicine unit.  They will do a thorough assessment and then take the proper actions that are based on best practices.",
            "Not a medical professional so idk how dangerous this has been for your wife/her pregnancy. Assuming she told her boss she was pregnant as soon as she found out, her boss should have made every effort to transfer the patient to someone else, especially if seeing the patient caused risk to the pregnancy. This definitely seems like a huge potential lawsuit against your wife's employer for not making sure anyone who could be at risk interacting with this patient directly, especially on a regular basis, knew of it and taking steps to make sure any such contact was minimal, if not outright not existent.",
            "Xray tech here- The only way a patient could be radioactive is if they were given a radioisotope for treatment which emits radiation after implantation. Radiation treatments via radiation therapy do not make the patient radioactive, but instead uses electromagnetic radiation which only affects the patients cells. They do not hold on to the radiation and emit it after the exposure has been taken.\n\nEdit: the radiation emitted from radioisotopes is also ionizing radiation except in this situation it could be harmful to other because the patient becomes the source of radiation ",
            "If he bites her your kid will be Spider Man.",
            "It really depends on the level of radiation. When my mom was going through radiation therapy for cancer, she was told she had to sleep in a separate bed from my dad. I vaguely remember her making jokes about not getting too close to her because she was radioactive. Shes passed so I cant ask her for details, and I dont want to force my dad or my siblings to remember. Ive seen other redditors talking about their own experience and how much it fluctuated based on radiation levels.\n\nBut, like someone else already commented, seeking actual medical advice relative to your situation and this specific patient is going to be a lot more helpful than asking the internet.",
