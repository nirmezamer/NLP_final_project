Can someone explain to me why is that and how it works? Also what can i update (moonraker, mainsail) without needing to set up the Can again?",

            "sounds like nonsense.  But keep in mind, you *will* sometimes need to re-flash newer firmware onto the ebb36.  Katapult is useful for doing this via the canbus network, rather than having to run USB cables back out temporarily",
            "I got Katapult flashed onto the EBB. So it is safe to update Klipper and moonraker?",
            "as long as you're prepared for the possible consequenses of updating, up to and including config changes, and needing to reflash mcus....yes"
