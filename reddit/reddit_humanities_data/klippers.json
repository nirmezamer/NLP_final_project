        "content": "I'm using klipper on my own hardware (a bigger gantry robot), and I'm not sure if my z-axis is drifting (rather through mechanical slippage than lost steps). I'd like to home my robot, move around for some minutes, home again and then read the position at which the limit switch was triggered. This should be very close to zero if I have no drift, but could tell me in which direction and how far I'm drifting. \n\nIs there way to get this value?",

It is connected to my 3d printer which has an SKR 3 EZ board.\n\nWhen the printer is on and the hotend is off, the heater fan is on and then when I set the temp to any temp, you can hear the fan slow down. Here is the heater\\_fan section of my config:\n\n\\[heater\\_fan fan1\\]\n\npin: PB5\n\nheater\\_temp: 50.0\n\nI have tried removing the heater\\_temp line altogether and the same thing happens so I believe the issue is coming from elsewhere. Here is the full config file: [https://pastebin.com/HmKhtVCD](https://pastebin.com/HmKhtVCD)\n\nAny help would be great. Thanks",

            "sounds like nonsense.  But keep in mind, you *will* sometimes need to re-flash newer firmware onto the ebb36.  Katapult is useful for doing this via the canbus network, rather than having to run USB cables back out temporarily",
