To me hair is one of the safest ways for kids to express themselves as cuts and colors grow out and are not more permanent like piercings or tattoos. I know some schools have dress codes on hair lengths and colors but if yours does not, talk politely with your parents that you'd like to express yourself with your own hairstyle choices and that will likely continue changing with time and styles, as your style changes. If your parents are fussy about their own hair then might be that way with yours also, especially if you have very image conscious parents. Good Luck! \ud83c\udf40",

Sometimes it\u2019s easier to show them then to try to describe what you want. Even if your hair is shorter, you can show them what your \u201cend goal\u201d is and they can shape you up to try to get you there eventually.",
            "When you get there you don't have to get it cut short. You can just ask the person working on your hair to just trim off any split ends, which will help you keep length. As long as your hair is healthy and growing at a reasonable pace you won't lose too much length, and regularly trimming off the damage will help it grow anyways.\n\nThe more difficult part may be the conversation with your parents afterward, if they explicitly booked this appointment because they want you to get a buzz cut or something. At the end of the day it's your hair, and you should be allowed to let it grow as you please, but unfortunately every parent is going to listen to that. One point you may be able to make since you want to grow it out long is that if it turns out that too long is driving you crazy and you don't like the extra upkeep long hair takes, you can always cut it back down to short. You can always take off more later, but you can't add hair back on if it's cut shorter than you like.\n\nHopefully regular appointments for trims- just trims- may be a compromise they can accept if it's them just worrying about the health of your hair.",

Coincidentally he was into metal and bands too. \n\nIt\u2019s not a bad cut but you\u2019d really benefit from incorporating more product into your hair. What do you use now? Have you tried mousse? I\u2019m also guessing you might be brushing your hair after it\u2019s starting to dry or is dry. If so, I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nReally make those curls / waves pop and tone down the puffiness a bit and I bet everyone will like it more, including yourself. A bit of a trim wouldn\u2019t hurt either but I\u2019d work on getting your hair more definition first and go from there."
