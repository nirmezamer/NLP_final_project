I'm new to the CG method (today was my third wash following it) and I've been struggling to plop - today I used a scrunchie to keep the tshirt in there but I guess it was too tight because the back of my hair is a floofy MESS  now. Front curls look great. I usually only wash my hair every 5 days so I was wondering if there's any way I can fix the back while leaving the rest alone? Would tying up the front and wetting just the back and scrunching gel in help?",

Speed ran from a Norwood Scale 2 and headed toward a Norwood 4, it seems. \n\nI'm trying to figure out my options to try to grow back hair and thicken the shafts of what I've got so it's not so fine and limp, but what I also need help with is figure out how to cut and style the hair I've got left. \n\nI used to keep the sides tapered and short, with ~5\" length up front for some Clark Kent curl. That curl's been better. It's a little to thin to strike fear in the hearts of villains, and it takes some TLC to come out at all. And on days when I need to slap some anti-frizz product on it, throw it in a side part, and run out the door, it's really limp and kinda schizo. It's not so much styled chaos as chaotic fallen souffle. Any suggestions on cuts/styling?",

If I run to work with just a frizz spray and air dry, it is so much more curly. If I try curl cremes, sprays, lightweight gel.. anything!! - it will stretch them out and look stupid. Idk what to do. My hair has always been straight to slightly wavy when air dry. Help. \u2639\ufe0f I am 32 yo with fine hair and likely high porosity. I tried the scrunching and raking and whatnot as well.
