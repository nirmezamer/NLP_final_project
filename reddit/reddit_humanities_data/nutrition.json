        "content": "Let's cut to the chase. We really need more moderators, especially those outside the Americas so the sub has help 'round the clock. We are looking to add several experienced Reddit users who have a passion for nutrition and a desire to help curate [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) as a collegial space for informative nutrition discussions.\n\nHere is what we are looking for from applicants. Please send applications to [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition).\n\n1. Modding experience on Reddit is great, but not required. Ditto for having a little coding experience. Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc.\n2. Mods need to be frequent Reddit users. The ideal mod is someone who pops into Reddit multiple times per day, can devote some time to addressing moderator issues when logging on, and foresees continuing to do so in the future.\n3. You should be a team player who is on board with following processes and procedures including using communications channels so that we stay on the same page and present a united and consistent front that prioritizes [r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) and its core users.\n4. You should be someone who is comfortable enforcing rules and able to handle receiving harsh/critical feedback from strangers on the internet without breaking down, losing your temper, or giving in.\n\nIf you are interested in applying, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition) with *a note which addresses all the points above (please use numbering)*. Do not leave your application as a comment here.\n\nLooking for the normally-sticked rules post?

            "In an effort to control my carbs and sugars in general, I've taken to eating keto certified bread and tortillas.  Thing is, I've noticed these things are LOADED with fiber.  Going by the nutrition info, I might be getting 200 - 300% of my daily recommended value.  I haven't had any noticeable digestive issues, but is there any worry about having too much of the fiber in these things?",
            "How long does it take to RAISE LDL levels? In February my Chol was good but my LDL was 103 so ever so slightly elevated. I attempted to do Keto, but I don't think I ever went into it- so I ended up eating a lot of Fat to no benefit. That was Feb and March. I was eating a lot of saturated fat but also food with good fats, like eggs and avocados. Now I'm trying to get back to eating carbs again. I'm worried my LDL spiked to unsafe levels over two months.",

            "Hello, question. I feel better on higher fat diet as a man. Today, many people go full keto, carnivore etc. And only eat saturated fats from red meat etc. Im opposite, i eat daily around 100g fats, sources Are nuts, olive oil, avocados, eggs and almost zero saturated fats, maybe 15g of saturated fats daily. I want to ask, am i missing something by not eating saturated fats ? I know some people say they are needed for testosterone, And that you will definitely have bigger testosterone on red meat like beef etc. than on nuts And avocados. Im not expert on this topic, So i want to ask your opinion on this ? Thank",

            "Im a 29F and have a really hard time eating the amount of food I need for the activity level I want. Im really not even eating enough for a completely sedentary lifestyle.  My main problem is I get full so fast and most things dont sound good. Im working on my cooking skills which I hope will help me look forward to eating more but its been a struggle. On days I think I did really well, I calculate up my calories and Ive eaten maybe 1000 calories and my macros are nowhere near what they should be except for the fat. I would appreciate any suggestions on foods that are high calorie, lower in fat and not very filling. Thanks in advance!"

People with food sensitivities or allergies or intentional diet change are usually very good at ensuring they get enough nutritions to compensate.

There's a lot of talk about the rise of certain cancers due to our diets in the US being lower in fiber anyway, on the extreme end of things. On the lesser end I know I wouldn't be able to poop. I guess wheat bread or grains are an option, assuming he's not just eating meat, but I've never met anyone who refused to eat their veges that was willingly eating wheat bread. Even then you'd have to eat a lot of it too.",

            "It is possible to live healthily on only animal meat, if your microbiome is adapted to it. The historical Maasai and Inuit populations ate entirely meat, and thrived. If you eat the entire animal, it's possible to get complete nutrition (livers have as much vitamin C as fruit, for example).\n\nThat said, if this dude is eating the bun with his burger and skipping the salad, he's not quite on the same level as an evolutionarily adapted indigenous tribesperson. He's probably just on the way to being diabetic.",

            "#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.\n\n**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  \n\n**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  \n\n**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy\n\n*Please vote accordingly and report any uglies*\n\n---\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
