        "content": "Let's cut to the chase. We really need more moderators, especially those outside the Americas so the sub has help 'round the clock. We are looking to add several experienced Reddit users who have a passion for nutrition and a desire to help curate [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) as a collegial space for informative nutrition discussions.\n\nHere is what we are looking for from applicants. Please send applications to [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition).\n\n1. Modding experience on Reddit is great, but not required. Ditto for having a little coding experience. Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc.\n2. Mods need to be frequent Reddit users. The ideal mod is someone who pops into Reddit multiple times per day, can devote some time to addressing moderator issues when logging on, and foresees continuing to do so in the future.\n3. You should be a team player who is on board with following processes and procedures including using communications channels so that we stay on the same page and present a united and consistent front that prioritizes [r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) and its core users.\n4. You should be someone who is comfortable enforcing rules and able to handle receiving harsh/critical feedback from strangers on the internet without breaking down, losing your temper, or giving in.\n\nIf you are interested in applying, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition) with *a note which addresses all the points above (please use numbering)*. Do not leave your application as a comment here.\n\nLooking for the normally-sticked rules post?

Today, many people go full keto, carnivore etc. And only eat saturated fats from red meat etc. Im opposite, i eat daily around 100g fats, sources Are nuts, olive oil, avocados, eggs and almost zero saturated fats, maybe 15g of saturated fats daily. I want to ask, am i missing something by not eating saturated fats ? I know some people say they are needed for testosterone, And that you will definitely have bigger testosterone on red meat like beef etc. than on nuts And avocados. Im not expert on this topic, So i want to ask your opinion on this ? Thank",

Should my schedule be opposite of most, since I work nights? Do I eat during that time, and not during the day?

            "Just so everyone is fully understanding how insane the current situation is if you want to market a new food additive in the US it undergoes basically the same first half of clinical testing that new drugs do to prove safety (unless you want to market it as a dietary fiber when it's an extra step so includes efficacy too).\n\nIf it's a supplement you just start selling it.\n\nI like being able to pick up random nootropics I can't get elsewhere in the world, but I am aware of the risks I am taking. Most people don't understand supplements have had no safety testing; due to lack of general regulation they often contain wildly different quantities of ingredients they claim and if they are made outside of the US they lack even the production sanitation standards that food has.
