            "If the Oilers win game 7, Knoblauch is going to be able to be Oilers coach for life if he wants.  He actually taught these guys how to play defence, which is absolutely insane if you've been watching the Oilers for the last fifteen years.",

The Panther forecheck that ate up the Eastern Conference has been effectively erased by Edmonton's play in their own zone after game 3. Paul Maurice needs to find something similar to get his team (other than Barkov, who has been great) pulling in the same direction again.",
