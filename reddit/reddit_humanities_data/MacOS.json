I never turn off my MacBook. I love how it starts up instantly.\n\nI do still have this thing about closing every app when I'm done with it. I have a feeling it's still drawing battery, even when I'm not using it. I'm not talking about apps like Safari, Notes or Mail. I'm talking about Ableton, Cubase, Xcode or CLion.\n\nHow do you handle these context switches? I'd love to use different desktops for these scenarios, but I'm afraid it'll affect battery life.\n\nI'm using a MacBook Pro M1 Pro 2021.",

            "i got used to doing the very same thing when apps were happy to track me, and when memory leaks were worse than they are now (but don't kid yourself; there are still memory leaks in some apps). Anyway, I continue to do so.",
            "I close documents, but almost never close apps.  They don't really take up resources when you aren't using them.\n\nFor many years now, macOS has supported automatic quitting of apps with no open documents, but only if the app explicitly supports this behavior.\n\nI'm pretty sure all Apple apps support this. I just tested and confirmed that this works with Preview, TextEdit, and Pages.  (Though when you first open those apps, they show an \"open\" dialog.  They won't auto-quit if that dialog box is open.)",
            "I use SwiftQuit which quits the app if all the windows are closed. I have some things on the \u201csafe list\u201d so that they\u2019ll stay open (like Apple Music, for example). I know it\u2019s not necessary, but I don\u2019t like the white dots on the dock icons (OCD)",
            "Been using MacOS for about 1.5 years and I close and quit almost everything when I\u2019m not using it, or when I put my Mac to sleep for the night. You\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t have to do this and can just open my MacBook in the morning and pick everything up where I left off? That might be a game changer for me",

            "I have a habit of closing anything I am not actively using. Tabs, apps, windows, everything.",
            "Yes I do. Part of it is due to an old habit from the 64/ 128 mb ram on 98/ xp days when I had to choose between music, browsing or playing a game. It never went away, despite having 64gb on my windows laptop or 16 on my minis. \n\nIt\u2019s also part OCD, I like having everything clean in my computer, inlcuding not having apps open. \n\nThe only app that I never close is the mail app, the rest get a command q as soon as I am done with them.",
            "Almost never. My habit is to either just close the document window (command-W) or Hide (command-H) the app, since opening an app which has been quit (command-Q) can take longer than one which is simply hidden. No issues with battery life or memory usage from hidden apps, at least not any that I use.",
            "I always CMD+Q resource heavy apps like Adobe\u2019s but lightweight stuff I just leave in the background.",

            "I've tried, in the past, on several occassions, to use the Apple Photos app and repeatedly found it isn't up to the job of doing what I want.\n\nA keep returning to GraphicConverter which is a brilliant app at a relatively low cost. OK, it doesn't have an iOS version but most of my photography is with a camera anyway.",
            "Basically same as what they showed for iOS 18. App is pretty consistent across all platforms. Has the same updates.",
            "I might look that up. I'm not happy with Photos but I'm trapped in it and pondering my abilty to escape. \n\nJust to explain, what i dont like is that everything is in one huge database and Ive had a couple of times its misfired and taken me ages to fix. Most recently (just last month) it renamed one person to another and forgot a second, but only when those two people were in the same photo. This was literally hundreds of photos. This had gone unnoticed for some time so even Time Machine was of very limited help.\n\nI'll check out graphics converter. That might be a winter project for me.",
            "Interesting, weird that they haven't shown it off at all or used it in marketing like they have for iOS",
            "The GraphicConverter image database is basically the Finder. You can set up an images folder wherever you want, unlike Photos which , as far as I can determine, forces you to store images either on the system drive or iCloud - mine is on an external drive but you can have multiple image folders wherever you wish. \n\nGC also has a wide range of tools for managing and organising images plus almost as good an image editing tool set as Photshop, all for under \u20ac40.\n\nI've been using GC for over 25 years - I have no financial or other involvement with GC. Photshop might have some advantages but at a significantly higher price.\n\nThe GC author is also very active on the GC forums. Any problems/questions, you'll get an answer usually within a few days. If he thinks it a good idea, he will also implement changes asked for by users, something neither Apple nor Adobe ever do - I wanted to rename a set of image files with reference to a spreadsheet which listed current file names and new file names. He implemented this within a couple of weeks.",
            "Thanks.  And I see from the forum it has face recognition.\n\nJust to be fair to Photos you can put the database wherever you want and you can have alternates which you can switch between. All still one humungous database though.  \n\nSo, my plan would be, export each album to a new location under a top level folder, lets call it GCImageDatabase. And the album name would be <location> or <event> eg i might have Hawaii2018 and CraftFair2011 etc folders. All under that central folder. And then point GC at that. I presume it does also create its own Db to cross reference pictures, eg pictures that contain \"Fred\" or pictures of a whale, or pictures in Hawaii, whatever? (Photos is good at locations)\n\nAlso as its shareware i can try it (I would buy if it works for me)\n\nNext step, I'm looking for more disks !\n\nI dont do a whole lot of editing but i did buy PIxelmator, does GC work with third party editors ?Worst case i can export out and back again if i dont like the tools in GC"
