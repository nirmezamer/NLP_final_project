        "content": "The subreddit r/LeagueOfMemes has, over time, received more and more content that doesn't quite fit any other sub. Sometimes it's casual discussion, low tier gameplay, general questions, bad memes, and similar things of this nature. The main sub r/leagueoflegends has strict content regulation and r/LeagueOfMemes keeps things strictly to memes/humor content. Rather than bend the rules here, we've decided it best to create a sister sub that does not (for the most part) regulate content. \n\nSo, with that in mind, we're happy to introduce r/LowEffortLeague!  **On this sub, you're free to post your bad memes, bad takes on the game, simple questions you could answer on your own by googling it, \"comment your main and I'll tell you X\" posts, etc--whatever your heart desires!**\n\nHowever, there are a few things that won't be allowed:\n\n1. Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry\n2. NSFW/NSFL content (including porn.... this is NOT a porn sub)\n3. Stolen content\n4. Giveaways, and other content that could fall into potentially scamming users\n5. Spam\n6. TOS breaking content\n\nA few more notes:\n\nYou are allowed to promote your streams and channels **if you have less than 50,000 subscribers and/or followers.** However, you are only allowed to do so by contributing something to the sub. For example, posting \"Watch me live at <this time>!\" would not be allowed. However, posting a gameplay clip and then promoting your channel in that post is fine. If you have more than 50k subscribers/followers and would like to post, simply message the mod team ahead of time to receive approval. \n\nIf you want to promote a discord server or find people to play with, in the interest of safety of the community please message the moderators first and receive prior approval before posting outbound links. Otherwise, they will be blocked by automod.\n\n---\n\nAs time goes forward we will likely have to adjust these, but hopefully this serves as a good starting point for the sub.\n\nHave fun everyone, hope to see you over at r/LowEffortLeague!",
