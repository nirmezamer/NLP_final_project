        "content": "The subreddit r/LeagueOfMemes has, over time, received more and more content that doesn't quite fit any other sub. Sometimes it's casual discussion, low tier gameplay, general questions, bad memes, and similar things of this nature. The main sub r/leagueoflegends has strict content regulation and r/LeagueOfMemes keeps things strictly to memes/humor content. Rather than bend the rules here, we've decided it best to create a sister sub that does not (for the most part) regulate content. \n\nSo, with that in mind, we're happy to introduce r/LowEffortLeague!  **On this sub, you're free to post your bad memes, bad takes on the game, simple questions you could answer on your own by googling it, \"comment your main and I'll tell you X\" posts, etc--whatever your heart desires!**\n\nHowever, there are a few things that won't be allowed:\n\n1. Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry\n2. NSFW/NSFL content (including porn.... this is NOT a porn sub)\n3. Stolen content\n4. Giveaways, and other content that could fall into potentially scamming users\n5. Spam\n6. TOS breaking content\n\nA few more notes:\n\nYou are allowed to promote your streams and channels **if you have less than 50,000 subscribers and/or followers.** However, you are only allowed to do so by contributing something to the sub. For example, posting \"Watch me live at <this time>!\" would not be allowed. However, posting a gameplay clip and then promoting your channel in that post is fine. If you have more than 50k subscribers/followers and would like to post, simply message the mod team ahead of time to receive approval. \n\nIf you want to promote a discord server or find people to play with, in the interest of safety of the community please message the moderators first and receive prior approval before posting outbound links. Otherwise, they will be blocked by automod.\n\n---\n\nAs time goes forward we will likely have to adjust these, but hopefully this serves as a good starting point for the sub.\n\nHave fun everyone, hope to see you over at r/LowEffortLeague!",

            "If we are taking canonical power level and not just casual plane flight, mord kills everyone and only Galio, Renekton, and Nasus have a chance of survival.\n\n\nIf we are talking just a casual plane ride without risk of a massive fight breaking out (but still having people be dangerous):\n2 is a trap, effectively the same as sitting between renekton and nasus but both are actively hating on each other rather than just one being absolutely bloodthirsty and the other trying to compromise, even if only for the flight. Even with Jax and Katarina around to keep garen and Sylas in line there is a likely chance sylas might decide to end garen and you would be caught between them.\n\n5 is my choice, Zed isn\u2019t inherently evil just misguided, Katarina has Garen to keep company, Kassadin isn\u2019t entirely insane, and illaoi will keep anyone in line who starts picking fights. If kayn turns to Rhaast he would atleast have the decency to wait till the flight was over before trying to slaughter everyone, and considering mord and Renekton of all champs are on the flight Rhaast is the least of my worries.\n\n4 is inadvisable. Kassadin isn\u2019t the issue, mord is. He would likely accidentally kill you just by sheer power of his soul magic over the flight. Unless you want to be a soulless husk, do not sit with the tin can.\n\n8 is also a pretty good spot, out of reach of Renekton and Nasus isn\u2019t gonna hurt you. You also are far enough away from any potential passive threats like mord.\nThough if Renekton chooses to beat on his brother you are likely in for a bumpy ride.",
