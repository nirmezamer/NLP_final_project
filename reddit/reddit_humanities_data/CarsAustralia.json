Otherwise, a similarly priced triton would present amazing value as you could probably find one with a lot more extras. I found that hilux's in this price range had a heap more km and even though they should be pretty rock solid, I liked the added surety of still being well within warranty and low km.",

            "Research the model, find out what needs doing and when the  ask for proof that's it's been done, this should include any major recalls. \n obviously  check the history on the vehicle to make sure it's not been stolen, written off or has finance owning, check that through the various online options and don't take the sellers word.",

Also ask about the Registration and how much is left on it. To see if they're bull shitting you. Go onto your states rego check and see if how much there's left on it. If the numbers don't add up don't trust the guy.\n\nDo that even if you're buying private.",

            "So much incorrect info. \nYou must go by the tyre plaque fitted to the car. This is the only legal option. \nIf you fit any different size to the car you must notify your insurance company as it is a modification. Failure to do so can render you not covered in the event of an accident. \nTyre shops will usually not fit incorrect sized tyres, because in the event of an accident they can be liable. \nYou cannot fit different tyre sizes front and rear unless the tyre plaque states this. \nIf you have aftermarket wheels fitted, there are vehicle standards that vary by state. All of these are modifications and must be disclosed to insurance agencies. \nFitting oversized tyres to rims different to the tyre plaque will change the overall diameter of the wheel/tyre combination. \nA 195 65 15 is A\nA 205 65 15 is  B\nDiameter\n635 A\n648 B\n+2%\n\nSidewall height\n127 A\n132 B\n+4%\n\nRevs/km\n502 A\n492 B\n-10\n\nYour speedo will show a lower speed. So you will be doing more than indicated. \nThis is because you haven't just changed the width. You have also changed the height. When you read tyre size, the 1st number is the width in mm.  The second is the height expressed as a percentage of the width. And the last is the internal diameter in inches. \nSo 195 65 15 means\nWidth is 195mm, height is 65% of 195 which is 127mm and internal diameter is 15\"\n205 65 15 is a width of 205, a height of 65% of 205 which is 132mm and an internal diameter of 15\".\nYou may find that in most states this makes the vehicle unroadworthy. \nSource - I am a mechanic"
