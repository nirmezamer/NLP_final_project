It cost us about 80k including buying the car, building the motor, upgrading the brakes and suspension, tires, etc. \n\nMine was done fully properly. As in safe, reliable, engineered, registered, roadworthy, it appeared visually stock and when the exhaust valve was closed it wasn't off it chops loud. \n\nThat thing was a handful when you were getting on it, but my girlfriend was able to daily drive it to work everyday. So I wouldn't say it was a bad car. \n\nWould I buy another one ? Probably not. It was definitely a great experience. Reliability wasn't ever a problem. The problem was self control and how expensive it was to do 20-40,000km a year in. It was absolutely shocking on fuel, nobody wanted to insure it for its true replacement value or wouldn't insure it for reasonable money because it was such a powerful car."

Car has been towed to trustworthy  family mechanic for confirmation on Monday.\n\nSeeing as head gaskets themselves  appear to be only around $300, I am guessing the cost of this job is all labour?  Does engine have to be pulled out?\n\nAs car was not driven with blown gasket, and there was  no engine-temperature warning light, this should  mean cost should not be ginormous, am I right?  Couple of grand? \n\nThanks for any advice.  Young bloke is fearing for his bank account\u2026. \n\n",

            ">\u00a0RACV and the guy came out and found little or no coolant where it should be and made this initial diagnosis.\n\nIt seems like a pretty big jump straight from missing coolant to blown head gasket, especially on the side of the road. \n\nGet it properly diagnosed before stressing too much as there are lots of things that could lead to coolant leaks and they range from blown head gasket down to busted $3 hose clamp. \n\n>Couple of grand?\n\nImpossible to say at this point, but that would hopefully cover most simple eventualities.",
            "Yeah, get a proper diagnosis and don't get ahead of yourself.",
            "That's a *massive* jump to make from a low coolant level with no other diagnosis. Plus, these engines aren't really known for their head gaskets packing it in.\n\nWhile they're not like gen 3 ones, I know the water pumps on those earlier EA888s did have some issues. If that water pump sprung a leak, I'd recommend getting a carbon clean done on the intake valves as a 'while you're in there' job since the water pump replacement calls for removing the intake manifold. Those engines suffered heavily from direct injection carbon buildup.\n\nIf that ends up being the problem, I'd expect somewhere within the $1-2000 range to sort it out.",
            "Blown head gasket would be  up there with the worst of outcomes so not too bad. It could be a leaking radiator, I\u2019m pretty sure that year model has the plastic sides on the rad and they are known to not be long lasting and leak, water pumps are also common on those, could also be simply a split hose. Pretty big assumption to call a blown head gasket on the side of the road from a racv guy. \n\nYes the gasket job is all labour, no the motor doesn\u2019t need to come out. I reckon around a grand all up for the job maybe less if you know the mechanic. \n\nIf it still had some coolant and the temp wasn\u2019t off the charts and still being driven it will be fine besides whatever is wrong with it currently.\n\nEdit, should add hopefully it\u2019s not the water pump cos that\u2019s going to cost more than the head gasket.",
            "Thanks so much for the informed assistance.  \n\nRACV guy apparently reckoned there was oil in the low amount of coolant.  \n\nWater pump info is gold.   We\u2019re sure the mechanic will be all over that.  Cheers. .",
            "Its probably not the head gasket, though it could be. VW incorporate recycled plastics into thier coolant system components to tick TUV guidelines and after 15 years, those parts can and will become brittle. Coolant at opperating temps is under very high pressure, it will find any holes, cracks, etc and escape. Luckily your child was smart and stopped the car when the light went on. It still may be an fairly expensive fix, because VAG parts are often not cheap or simple to source and replace, but i would be hopeful that the car is fine.",
            "Also, water pump. Which is a very common issue on these. Unfortunately also rather expensive."
