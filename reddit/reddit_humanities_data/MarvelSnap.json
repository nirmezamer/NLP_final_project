            "Returning player here, my last spotlight was Warmachine. Can I get a list of good cards to get using tokens?",
            "Thena or Nocturne as a token pickup?",
            "What happens when you split a card with a custom border, does the split get it too?",
            "If I immediately retreat in a conquest match, does that count towards the win a game with X in your deck missions for my opponent?\n\nTonight I was doing quests in PG and noticed my opponent was playing a Gilgamesh deck so I was wondering if retreating a few times would help with the weekend mission.",
            "Can anyone share a phastos deck that isn't bounce or junk?",
            "When are emotes in the shop?\n\nI feel like I've seen them once months ago, and I haven't been able to login at the right time since.",
            "Whats the best deck in the game at the moment? \n\nReached level 83, but have fallen to 78. My opponent seems to always have perfect card draw or a perfect deck to counter whatever Im using.",
            "prolly get more use out of nocturne",
            "Custom borders go on the \"custom\" card which can't be split. But any split you have can be used as the custom card, so effectively all of your splits of that card have the border.",
            "He's fine in Surfer - pick your least favourite 3 and cut it for Phastos."

            "Bruh, skipping all the shit last week to have my first key be Makkari was a real slap to the balls.",
            "Im excited to add him to my Thanos deck. Zero cost stones that can draw you more cards seems good. And if I dont draw him by turn 3, theres still other options with a Thanos deck.",
            "If u don't draw him phast you're tost",
            "I'm looking forward to try him in a Galactus deck and see what happens.",
            "I've seen Phastos every match. Personally, I think he's great. I was able to use Absorbing Man on him and can confirm the effects stack. My next draw was -1 cost AND +2 power. Don't know if it can stack to -2 cost or +4 power yet. All in all, I'm very happy and love the card so far.",
            "He's better than I thought it'd be, very fun card so far.",
            "Using him in a Kitty/Angela/Thena deck has been great so far. There's a 50% chance to have him in your hand by turn 3 -- not bad. It's added good value to that deck (for me).\n\nBar Sinister has given me huge cards in power and low energy in the other two lanes. I think it's worth sacrificing the lane if you have him on hand by turn 3.",
            "The overall negativity about this card suggests to me that it's going to be hugely OP considering cards are the opposite of whatever the hivemind thinks.",

            "Magik + Doc Oc is a very good package. You close down a lane and either you do win that lane on turn 5, or you have 2 turns to beat that lane that the opponent can't play on. It's really effective.",
            "I just got to infinite using this deck (first time), I dont know why it works but I went from 91>Infinite in a matter of hours with minimal losses. Its a very simple deck.",
            "Just gonna pile on thay its mill. Magik is to extend the game so they can ock on 5 or 6 then shit on whatever it pulls out to steal his lane. Wolverine is in there to discard so he's basically a 0/4 that protects u from discarding anything else with samurai",
