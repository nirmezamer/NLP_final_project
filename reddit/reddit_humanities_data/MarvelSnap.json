            "Still fairly new to the game. I hear people on YT playing using the phrase \"on curve\". Also the word \"split\" on a card design. Can anyone explain the terminology? Thanks in advance!",
            "Do $29 and $99 ever return to store? I missed a bundle I wanted to buy and now I'm sad about it (Symbiont Black Widow)",
            "How does summoning at a random location work in terms of probability? Is it based on number of open spaces or split evenly with all available locations? \n\nLike let's say I discard wolverine and the left location has 1 spot open, the middle is wide open, and the right has 1 card in it. Is it equally likely to go in all locations or more likely to go into the middle > right > left? \n\nI believe it has equal chance since it essentially has 1 \"available spot\" in each location since it only takes up one spot, but thought I'd check if someone has demonstrated this.",
            "Are there any good low budget (CL1300) decks with Wong out there? Bought the bundle hoping to get something going with Wong+Tiger+Odin but I don't understand how to fill the rest of the deck and all the videos I see online are extremely outdated\n\nStruggling with winning now that I hit infinite and everyone just bodies me, lost \\~10 games in a row to insane combos. I hit infinite with Thena Disrupt deck which is basically \"disable everything they have\" through Echo+Cosmo+Goose but it stopped working so I figured the ol' reliable might be a solution",
            "Question about the 700-900g borders in the shop!\n\nIf I purchase a gold one and put it on...whatever, an Angela variant. That means any future Angela card I get will have that border as an option? Or is it just one at a time, but can be swapped between any Angela card at any moment?\n\nI picked up two already when they went on sale but haven't connected them to cards yet as I wasn't sure if they were locked to a variant or split and didn't want to make a rash choice! So just wanted clarification from those who know firsthand!",
            "I have the challenge to win all three locations today for season pass challenge and it\u2019s driving me nuts, every time I\u2019m about to win them all the other player retreats and I don\u2019t get it.. how do you guys do this one?",
            "Will arishem give credit for the weekly token quest if the spotlight card gets randomly added to your deck?",
            "How does one change their player name to something else? Every time I want to change my name to something I want it to be, it does not go through.",
            "Is the order that you get series 3 cards ACTUALLY random because I really have a hard time believing that it is. I'm conveniently still missing a ton of actually useful series 3 cards and the shop conveniently keeps pushing them to me in bundles for $15 - $20 every month. The amount of times the game has tried to get me to buy Hela, She Hulk, and Wong (not the current variant bundle I get \"for you\" bundles for him too) is amazing considering I'm pulling cards like Silver Samurai and Bast/Mysterio in a row (two recent conquest variants). It just seems super fishy to me.\n\nI'm just really frustrated with how slow the series 3 grind is because I'm basically forced into playing the same two decks over and over for weeks because I don't have any other cards.",
            "When are we getting more than 20 deck slots? And what about deck folders (to organize: classics, new cards, etc.). With new cards every week, 20 decks are too few.\n\nAlso on decks: how about reverse search? Pick a card and see what decks you have that in."

            "I am glad she is out it gives me one more week to save keys",
            "Awesome card! She is really going to help me save some keys",
            "This is the perfect example of a card that should be a series 4 at launch.  \n\nIt will likely have some use, especially in Surfer decks.  But the potential free four points doesn't justify replacing a card in most other decks.\n\nCould be a fun card to play around with and try to come up with other uses, but not for 6k tokens.",
            "Wanted Gladiator, had 3 keys so went for it. I got Makkari and Gladiator next. Ok new card, let\u2019s try it out. First game, Makkari immediately runs to the space throne\u2026",
            "m baku but bigger in power  and better functionality  lolXD",
            "Why is this not a series 3 release. We need few of those here and then.",
            "I think players are overstating the risk of her running into a bad location. There are good locations to run to as well. Just won a game in part because she landed in Quantum Realm, bypassing the power loss.\n\nI was going to get her for C3, then was going to skip her because I don't believe in C4... at the last minute I realized there's a synergy with Sersi, who's been losing me ranks but a lot of fun. Sersi magnifies the power of cost reduction. Makkari is free, but she's \"just\" a stat stick, and a small stat stick at that. Re-rolling into a random 4-cost starts looking like better value.\n\nProbably still mostly niche. But I think better than the community-average opinion of her. Location risk is scary but lower in practice, with potential high upside as well.",
            "I just want to say that I really appreciate that this card is getting people to try decks that I haven\u2019t seen much of before, instead of just a card that people slot into existing archetypes.\n\nMoon Girl stuff, Strong Guy stuff, off-meta Surfer, Storm/Legion, midrange tempo. I\u2019ve seen some pretty cool brews since she was released and I think that\u2019s a good thing for the game overall. \n\nNot every new release needs to shape the meta.",
            "I just don\u2019t see any deck for this card. Surfer? Too crowded, doesnt really edge anything else? Cerebro? C4? Ehhhh. It just feels dead on release.",
