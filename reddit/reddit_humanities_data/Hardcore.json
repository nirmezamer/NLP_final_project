At the same show, A man named Andrei suffered an injury during madballs set, and has required emergency brain surgery. If any of you can help him out, it would mean a lot to me. In addition, my friends were kind enough to start a gofundme for me as well, but I am not the priority in this situation. I\u2019ll leave both links below. Thank you to the best community in music. \n\nAndreis fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-andrei-recover-after-emergency-brain-surgery?member=34502769&sharetype=teams&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer\n\nJake\u2019s fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jakes-recovery-from-traumatic-brain-injury?member=34565209&sharetype=teams&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer\n",

For such a fun and generally enjoyable evening, both of your injuries were huge scares and some of the worst I've seen.\u00a0\n\n\nI really wish you both the best in your recovery.\u00a0 Thanks for sharing these links.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Shit man. I hope you an Andrei recover. I didn't see what happened but I saw you both on the floor after. I saw Andrei while being carried outside and his face was covered in blood but honestly I just thought somebody knocked him out in the pit and he was gonna be fine. I didn't imagine it could be something so serious.\u00a0\u00a0Was it good that people took him outside inmediatly? I know sometimes the right thing to do is not to move the person that's hurt and wait for the paramedics. If somebody knows it would be cool to know a little more of what to do in this situations. It can happen to any of us that go to hardcore shows.",

I could tell his head was bleeding bad while those with medical knowledge helped him while waiting for the ambulance to come (which took like 10 minutes). He was conscious the whole time, so I figured it would maybe just be some stitches, but this is awful to hear.",

Fits maybe 100 people max.\n\nThere were some heavier bands, so I got clipped once, kicked in the face once, but that\u2019s whatever, it\u2019s a tiny venue and I was in the pit.\n\nHere\u2019s what got me through.  My wife is standing in the back.  Not the back of the pit, THE BACK.  This kid starts swinging in the middle of the crowd.  He wasn\u2019t in the pit, he started from back there.  My wife got kicked in the neck, and that\u2019s not cool.\n\nIn all my 16 years going to shows, I\u2019ve never seen some shit like this.  I\u2019ve never started a fight at a show over moshing, because I think it\u2019s goofy to beat someone up at a show where you expect to get hurt, but this almost would have been that time.\n\nI don\u2019t like hearing all the preachy bullshit about the \u201cscene,\u201d but doing shit like this gives us a bad rep, then \u201cnormies\u201d complain, then venues don\u2019t want to put on a show with xPAIN OF TRUTH TIL LOYALTYx anymore, and then we\u2019re stuck with push-pit indie bands at every DIY show.  I\u2019m gonna have to retire from moshing at shows eventually, which is sad to me already, and I sure as hell don\u2019t wanna deal with this when I\u2019m 50.",

If you watch from the pit or the front, you agree to what happens. If you stand at the back, you are not consenting to engage in violence. If you kick somebody minding their own business in the back don't get upset if you get your ass kicked, stabbed, or worse.",

Here in Europe, we go by two rules:\n\n- what happens in the pit, stays in the pit\n\n- fuck around and find out",

            "I started going to shows over 20 years ago in a major city. I was just a little kid really, a 7th grader. Crowdkilling literally didn\u2019t exist because, if you were punching and kicking people outside of the pit, you would get stomped. All the moshing and dancing happened near the center-front of the stage. Anyone who just wanted to watch stood around them. It was a good system. I think it\u2019s hilarious now that you\u2019re only allowed to punch and kick people if you\u2019re a crowdkiller these days. In other words, you\u2019re only allowed to kick and punch the people who don\u2019t hit you back. I still go to shows, but every time I see someone crowdkilling or being stupid, I just go to the bar. \n\nI go to the bar often.",

Got the lad on the floor and all of his mates came running over spouting shit that she shouldn't be here if she can't handle crowd killing. \n\n\nThen they're the absolute cock wombles that complain about the local scene not being big enough.",
