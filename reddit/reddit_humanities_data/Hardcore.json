        "content": "Hey guys. I know some of you are aware of what happened to me at the drain show in Brooklyn, but this post is not about me. At the same show, A man named Andrei suffered an injury during madballs set, and has required emergency brain surgery. If any of you can help him out, it would mean a lot to me. In addition, my friends were kind enough to start a gofundme for me as well, but I am not the priority in this situation. I\u2019ll leave both links below. Thank you to the best community in music. \n\nAndreis fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-andrei-recover-after-emergency-brain-surgery?member=34502769&sharetype=teams&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer\n\nJake\u2019s fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jakes-recovery-from-traumatic-brain-injury?member=34565209&sharetype=teams&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer\n",

            "Shit man. I hope you an Andrei recover. I didn't see what happened but I saw you both on the floor after. I saw Andrei while being carried outside and his face was covered in blood but honestly I just thought somebody knocked him out in the pit and he was gonna be fine. I didn't imagine it could be something so serious.Was it good that people took him outside inmediatly? I know sometimes the right thing to do is not to move the person that's hurt and wait for the paramedics. If somebody knows it would be cool to know a little more of what to do in this situations. It can happen to any of us that go to hardcore shows.",
            "Fuck this shit is tragic, man.",
            "In addition, if anyone has any information on how andrei got hurt, PLEASE dm me. His wife has been left in the dark on his situation. Thank you once again!",
            "This is bullshit, Stuff like this should not happen in the scene. I hope both of them make a recovery and are able to heal sending lots of love.",
            "Thank you for sharing this and I'm glad you're doing alright. I was by merch when about 5 guys carried Andrei over to the area and put him on the floor over there. I could tell his head was bleeding bad while those with medical knowledge helped him while waiting for the ambulance to come (which took like 10 minutes). He was conscious the whole time, so I figured it would maybe just be some stitches, but this is awful to hear.",
            "Sooo, what happened? Didnt find anything on it.",
            "Is it just me or have more people been getting hurt at shows recently? And it's almost all stage diving related. I love moshing hard and don't mind getting the bruises or getting the wind knocked out of me, but the stage diving and crowd surfing is really starting to piss me off. It's so much risk of harm, and for what? Accidents happen, I don't even care if an arm or leg gets broken, but multiple traumatic brain injuries is so fucking dumb y'all.",
            "First and foremost, I hope the dude makes a full recovery. I know this makes me sound like a boring old fuck, but the sort of behaviour that leads to incidents like this is completely stupid; I often see hardcore folks making fun of 'push pitters' and the like, but at least I know my kids can go to a metal or punk show and come home in one piece; sad that I couldn't always be sure of the same thing if it was a hc show.",
            "How TF does something that serious happen?"

I remember it being the first album to really shock me with how aggressive and fucking fast it was. When Fight Fire With Fire drops into the main riff after the dainty acoustic intro it makes me go full caveman.\n\nEdit: also, props to Priest for releasing some of the most energetic material of their career with Invincible Shield, that shit kinda slaps. Not a historian of the band by any means but I enjoyed my listen of it. Dudes are killing it at their age.",
