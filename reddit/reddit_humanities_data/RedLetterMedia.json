            "That episode where mike is speaking with the guest star. He just keeps changing his mind about whether it is going to genre battle or black spine. I don't even know whether it was a black spine or some other episode",
            "It was a behind the scenes moment. Rich is on the floor building something , IIRC Mike asked him how he was doing.  He said he was ok, and fine with things just being ok, as opposed to 'good'. I just loved what he said, and can't find it.",
            "I'm looking for a video that was on a BOTW/WOTW where a woman is talking to a child and seems to always mouth along to whatever the child is saying... almost like she's predicting what the kid is going to say and subtley/subconsciously lip synching along to what the kid is saying. I know this is highly specific. I wanna say it was a classroom/anti-bullying video? Maybe the one with the green bear mascot?\n\nI am just trying to show my partner that this is a thing some people do subconsciously and that's the only example I can think of off the top of my head.",
            "The hitb where Mike shits on modern Will Ferrell",
            "theres one that this guy busts in on his gf or wife cheating on him and he screams YOU FUCKERS i know its on BOTW",
            "what's the one where some woman in a movie says something like \"don't touch me, you snake-squeezer!\"",
            "What episode is that one moment where Mike tells rich he looks like he's waiting at the dentists office",
            "Not sure whether it was HITB or BotW, but I recall them talking about one of the found footage horror movies from the V/H/S series. I think it may have been V/H/S/94? It may have just been a quick aside in one of their videos.",
            "Which BOTW episode was it that featured that kids video with a guy playing a kid with a huge set to make him look smaller, i think it had a really long nonsense title, and ended with the promise that the guy was gonna get a tv series but obviously didn't.",
            "Which episode of HitB had Jay mention that they needed to get Plinkett\u2019s money for his crack (I think that was the chosen drug) addiction? Mike responded by pointing out that this was a new development and an hereto undiscussed part of Jay\u2019s lore"
