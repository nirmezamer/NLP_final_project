            "That episode where mike is speaking with the guest star. He just keeps changing his mind about whether it is going to genre battle or black spine. I don't even know whether it was a black spine or some other episode",
            "It was a behind the scenes moment. Rich is on the floor building something , IIRC Mike asked him how he was doing.  He said he was ok, and fine with things just being ok, as opposed to 'good'. I just loved what he said, and can't find it.",
            "I'm looking for a video that was on a BOTW/WOTW where a woman is talking to a child and seems to always mouth along to whatever the child is saying... almost like she's predicting what the kid is going to say and subtley/subconsciously lip synching along to what the kid is saying. I know this is highly specific. I wanna say it was a classroom/anti-bullying video? Maybe the one with the green bear mascot?\n\nI am just trying to show my partner that this is a thing some people do subconsciously and that's the only example I can think of off the top of my head.",
            "The hitb where Mike shits on modern Will Ferrell",
            "theres one that this guy busts in on his gf or wife cheating on him and he screams YOU FUCKERS i know its on BOTW",

            "What episode is that one moment where Mike tells rich he looks like he's waiting at the dentists office",
            "I think this was recent but I can't seem to find it:\n\nWhat is the video where Mike contemplates about the abuse / uncarefulness of the movie props / memorabilia in their posessions. Mike then says that they won't feature such abuse / uncarefulness in future videos eventhough they probably won't baby the props IRL.\n\nAm I imagining this?",
            "Not sure whether it was HITB or BotW, but I recall them talking about one of the found footage horror movies from the V/H/S series. I think it may have been V/H/S/94? It may have just been a quick aside in one of their videos.",

            "Looking at about a third being sequels or based on existing IPs, you can see the very early stages of the sequel pattern really emerging in the bottom half I think. Obviously being just top 3 grossing per year not a perfect example of what was being released but again, just a graphic to sort of visualize it and see what Jay is talking about when he mentions the sequels really starting to get more frequent in the late 80s and early 90s (if I am quoting him correctly)",

            "The one I think they're missing is Three Men and a Baby, which I believe was number one for 1987. Only know that because it's such a strange movie to have been the number one box office draw (Not to mention the obvious Star Trek connection with the director) \n\nAlso, so many best picture nominees and winners in this group. A trend that largely evaporated for most of the '90s, 00s, and 10s, only recently have top box office draws also been best picture contenders",
