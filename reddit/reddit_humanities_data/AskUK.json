We can never, ever just pull in.\n\nAnd some days, they do something odd to make us wait even longer - like one guy bent down as we turned in, to tie his shoe laces. So we were just sat there watching him. Last week, a father was walking with his daughter and she just decided to sit down on the ground and he was trying to coax and pull her to her feet while we sat and waited. A guy on his bike stopped and started messing with his wheel. Or a car will be sat there and maintenance vans park outside our drive and noone elses.\n\nBut without fail, there's always someone walking past our drive as we pull in. \n\nWe're convinced someone somewhere, like The Truman Show, is like 'okay, they're coming up the road, walking man #67 go, go, go you're on in 3..2..1..'\n\nWhat happens too often for you to think its a coincidence or that life is all a simulation?",

Nope, closed, never saw it open again until it got bought over and refurbished by someone else. We still joke about how it was some sort of weird fever dream.

Therefore there are no glitches or telltale signs. There is no outside the simulation for the likes of you and I. The simulation, which could be one of an infinite number of simulations, was probably run for reasons we cant comprehend, and also, that our existence within the simulation is a by product, a quirk, if you like of that simulation. A quirk that the simulators probably dont even know exists within their simulation."

The walls between the buildings are literally inches apart and it\u2019s not an accessible space.\n\nFor years, what is now the bar was a string of different restaurants. But now, an area of the bar has been made into a dance floor area, which happens to be directly next to mine and my small child\u2019s bedroom.

I slept about 3 hours last night and I\u2019m exhausted and asking for strangers help online.\n\nObviously I don\u2019t want to stop people having a good time, and I\u2019m aware that living in the center of a town means putting up with some noise (the other side of the house actually backs onto the garden of another pub so we get plenty of \u2018joviality\u2019 from there that doesn\u2019t bother me!) - but the last month or so has been so miserable with this bloody thumping! Is there any legal limit on this sort of thing? Or can anyone come up with suggestions that aren\u2019t me leaving the house every weekend?! I don\u2019t want to just go round there and moan to the manager without a potential solution.\n\nFor context, apparently the bar was in fact another pub with a club type arrangement for a while before we moved in, and it\u2019s now one of the few places in town that\u2019s open until late. If I was younger I would probably just go to the bar itself until it closes but middle age and parenthood has other ideas! \n\nEDIT: there was a bar/ late night venue (not sure if it would be considered a \u2018club\u2019) BEFORE the building was converted to residential and we bought it.

The pub never turns them off before midnight - last night it was 1am - and Council just don't care that they're breaching their licence & rules on noise every single night!!
