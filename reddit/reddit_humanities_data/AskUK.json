Like completely obliterated it\n\nThe police were called and turned up just after I\u2019d eaten the eighth of hash I had in my pocket. They arrested me and took me into the station, I got chatting with the young PC who\u2019d arrested me on the way in. Once we got to the station, he interviewed me, wanting to know all the ins and outs of what had happened. I was absolutely straight with him, fully expecting to be punished to the full extent of the law and told him exactly what had happened. He took my statement then went off to talk to his sergeant\n\nHe came back a couple of hours later and told me he\u2019d managed to get me off with a caution as the person whose van I\u2019d destroyed wasn\u2019t wanting to press charges ( I\u2019d told the copper that I knew the van was being used with no MOT and there was red diesel in the tank, when the police asked him about this, he declined to press charges). He also said he was waiting for an answer from his sergeant about whether he could let me have the axe back\n\nUnfortunately, the sergeant decided that was a step too far and they confiscated the axe but I got off with a caution for criminal damage when I fully expected a court case and possible prison time. At one point the PC told me that he\u2019d been divorced under similar circumstances a couple of years previously and he\u2019d love to have been able to do what I did.

Everyone just considered him harmless until he began getting aggressive toward some people, eventually exposing himself at Sainsbury's.\n\nUpon further research, my friends and I found out that he's got a rap sheet a mile long, with charges ranging from public drunkenness to kidnapping. After he was run in for the Sainsbury's incident, many of the people that he had abused and threatened were contacted by police to share their stories, because at this time, a lot of people, especially those with children, were scared.\n\nThe aggressive and exhibitionist pisshead was *encouraged* to go to rehab in lieu of a proper punishment.

I have never gotten up and left a room so fast in my life.\n\nEdited to add: his brother, my friend, is the only one acting like this is gross BTW. I'm not friends with someone who endorses child grooming."
