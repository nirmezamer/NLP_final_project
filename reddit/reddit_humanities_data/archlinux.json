Using an installer defeats this expectation.\n\n# Why was the beginners guide removed?\nIt carried a lot of maintenance on the wiki admin as it duplicated a lot of information, and everyone wanted their addition included. It was scrapped for a compact model that largely referenced the main wiki pages.\n\n# Why Arch Linux?\n\n[Arch compared to other distributions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_compared_to_other_distributions)\n\n# Follow the wiki.
