It is targeted at the proficient GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation, and solve their own problems.",
            "speaking of the changing computing landscape, how many people realistically start their Linux journey with arch, anyway? We should probably start by understanding our demographic first.\n\nArch is primarily maintained by volunteers, so support will be a big issue. doesn't help that arch project itself expects the users to have prerequisite background in information technology to actually understand the wiki.\n\nlike sure archinstall, but I'm not really buying it, given that it does not support dual boot on a single drive. something many other distro installers (from the more user friendly distros) support and even take pride in. asking a newbie to have another drive to \"back up\" their data before they even start using Linux is gonna be a hard sell, when their first computer probably comes with zero effort windows setup and the only \"back up\" they have to deal with is onedrive.",
            "I feel I need to add something to this;\n\nWhen I co-founded this sub back in 2008 with Kousi, one of our key missions from the beginning had been to oppose the elitism and RTFM that even back then was near constant in the community. \n\nInstalling Arch back then felt like you'd climbed a real mountain and very few ever made it. \n\nIt felt like asking for help with your very first Arch install was met with people literally telling you to RTFM and refusing to actually help you.\n\nWe wanted to break that cycle, and make this sub a place where brand new users could come, regardless if they'd read the wiki or not, and ask for help that itself might be contained in the wiki, but maybe they'd failed to search the wiki properly for it. Its built in search engine wasn't the best, and if the person concerned wasn't fluent in English and using Google Translate, it could make using the wiki VERY difficult; It still is in fact. \n\nThe Arch Wiki, whilst a great store of information is still very difficult to use if English isn't your native language. \n\nSo welcoming brand new users who struggle with the wiki, and have been pushed out of the IRC channels, is possibly the PRIME mission of this sub. It seems I might have to iterate this point in the rules or something.",
            "**tl;dr:** We will have to come to terms with growing numbers of zero-effort posts in r/archlinux whether we like it or not. Trying to gatekeep Arch newcomers by shunning things like archinstall or quitting the subreddit in protest because we don't like the way they post questions (as infuriating as it can be) isn't going to make Arch better in the long run.\n\n...\n\nI only have a few months of Arch under my belt, though I did spend a some years cutting my teeth with Debian (and, to a lesser extent, Pop!\\_OS). I can say, with confidence, that the switch to Arch has increased my understanding of Linux and low-level processes tenfold because of its DIY nature, great documentation (albeit flawed in some regards), and passionate fast-acting community. This, in turn, has fueled my desire to give back by helping out those that I can on this subreddit since I'm not a developer and unfortunately have little/no ability to contribute to growing Arch under the hood.\n\nThat said, I'm also the kind of person who's unafraid to dig through man pages, github/gitlab issue trackers, defunct forum posts, and, of course, Reddit to find answers I need as quickly as possible. Posting a new question is hands-down the absolute last resort when I've exhausted everything I can dig up myself -- if anything, I simply don't want to wait hours or days for a solution when there's a good chance it's out there if I look hard enough. When we speak of changing landscapes, though, the reality is that people like \"us\" are becoming fewer and more far between because there are now the equivalent of two generations of folks whose entire lives have existed within the realm of having access to instantaneous information. For them, posting a what we would consider a \"zero effort\" question and getting someone's response in 'real time' is akin to us making a quick google search because that's what their entire lives have consisted of and how they've interacted with the world up to this point (and I'm not saying this in a condescending way, it's just a fact of how our societies are evolving for better or worse). Heck, we're even seeing a major shift of focus to low-code/high-level programming tools and new education dedicated to learning how to build AI prompts that will software for us nowadays. It's unavoidable that folks whose entire lives have consisted of interacting with computers in this manner are going to seek out answers in the manner they are familiar with which may not jive with how so-called \"purists\" have been doing things up to this point and would like to continue seeing going forward.\n\nI do, however, think that we should encourage/enforce newcomers to actively engage with the subreddit, not just post one-and-dones without follow up (e.g., not posting a thanks or the outcome of trying the suggestions they've been provided). There's already r/linux4noobs which caters to Linux newcomers and likely has higher tolerance for that kind of stuff, hence I think r/archlinux should expect a somewhat higher standard among its posters.",
            "Arch is maintained by highly knowledgeable experts, and those that help users in a forum like this Reddit are too. I don't think the aim should be to make Arch a pleasant experience for newbies at all. The aim should be to keep it a pleasant experience for those skilled and experienced Linux hackers. Imho, that means to keep things as they were. So what is changing that requires change? I believe only one thing: Arch has gotten the attention of the masses it is more popular. That has resulted in an influx of non-experienced more \"common\" users. The result of that is a flood of the so called zero-effort questions that change the feel of this community (the Reddit one) and might even chase the skilled experts that are helping away. \n\nI think we have to acknowledge this change and take measures to keep the experts, to keep Arch the dist for competent Linux enthusiasts\n\nIt seems unavoidable that this means a harsher moderation that demands effort (reading the wiki trying things out and only asking for help once you can give a report of what one tried what the results were and where you got stuck)..",
            "In my view, the only truly annoying posts are ones which clearly didn't read the rules nor the FAQ, seemingly made no effort to do any research on their own first, and where the poster doesn't engage with the comments at all. I'm personally happy to help out new users, even if their questions kind of suck, if I can feel like I'm working *with* them to understand and solve their problem, not that they're just expecting to have me solve all their problems for them with no effort on their part.\n\nThis seems like the overall sentiment in this thread, too, although others are seemingly much more frustrated with that kind of behavior than I currently am.\n\nTo me, it seems to be a failure to \"remember the human,\" that is the askers of zero-effort questions fail to remember that anyone who answers them on here is a real person taking time out of their day to perform a volunteer service. The concomitant lack of effort on the askers' parts mean they will likely *not* read the rules, FAQ, or wiki, no matter how good those resources are, so I'm not convinced that any solutions revolving around those resources is going to be effective.\n\nOne possible solution could be to use an \"approved poster\" system, where you can get a flair by showing some minimum amount of effort \u2013 I'm thinking of a really low bar, like having a \"secret\" phrase in the rules that you can DM to the mod team to get flaired. Flared users would then be allowed to post freely, much as the sub is now. Posts from unflaired users would go into a review queue for mod approval before being posted.\n\nHopefully needing to invest a minimum of effort will lead to higher quality questions and more engagement from askers overall. And even those people who miss that step can still post, as long as they're willing to wait for a mod to look at their post and confirm it's not egregious. This potentially also sidesteps some of the issues that have been mentioned in this thread already, like the fact that even knowing where to start with the wiki might be challenging for a newcomer or non-native English speaker, since users falling into these categories but who are otherwise engaged and ready to learn would not be restricted from posting. Seeing that the asker has gone to the effort to get a flair may also encourage answerers to be less dismissive of low-knowledge (but not low-effort) posts, cutting down on the number of \"read the wiki\" comments. \n\nThe main potential drawback I can see is that this would create potentially a *lot* of new work for the mod team, and current moderator bandwidth may not be enough to handle it (depending on the flux of new users). I'm sure there are other drawbacks I've not thought of, too.",
            "Whenever these posts happen, you see people complain about how many poorly worded questions from newbies who clearly didn't read the wiki there are. \n\nI've been on this subreddit for around 7 years, it's always had a ton of posts like that. I remember people celebrating when the \"beginners install guide\" was removed from the wiki, as they blamed it for all the low quality posts. The posts never stopped, and despite all the complaints, archinstall didn't make it drastically worse.\n\nFurther, I don't understand what people want without those posts. Do they want more \"isn't Arch great,\" \"what WM is the best,\" or \"man systemd sucks\" circlejerks? Do they want more of the help requests where the problem isn't easily solved by the wiki, so gets nearly zero replies? People have some notion that without the low quality support posts this will be some drastically different community, and I just don't see that. \n\nIf anything \"recently\" has sparked an increase in help posts, it's the removal of the \"beginners questions megathread\" that was pinned but got removed when the Reddit mods drama happened. But please don't bring it back. Few people regularly checked it to provide help, meaning simple questions would go days being unanswered while someone else would make a new post with the same question and have it answered in minutes",

        "content": "Edit: Noticed this might have come off a little edgy. I am trying to say that Linux is built ground up for real time and mission critical applications like real time audio processing and machine learning. Windows doesn\u2019t hold a candle in this regard and I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how much farther along the Linux desktop would be if good software developers (even enterprise/commercial ones) adopted Linux as opposed to Windows. Sorry for the confusion. I still do think there is some headassery (discord mod calls girls kitten energy) but I should have been more clear and the Arch community deserves better. A better title would have been \u201cLinux is the most powerful platform to develop on, Why aren\u2019t more commercial/enterprise software developers on board?\u201d\n\nHey homies, I use arch btw. \n\nNow that I got the secret password out of the way, we need to have an open discussion about what I believe is the biggest factor that is keeping the Linux Desktop from being widely adopted.\n\nI\u2019ll start with a little anecdote about the software that is keeping me from reaching my full potential, FL Studio. I have for about a decade have been trying to get FL Studio to work on Linux (with real-time capabilities). \n\nI am not an edgy teenager trying to make Windows/Mac software work on Linux for bragging rights. I am a musician who has worked at dozens of live music venues in NYC. \n\nFrom live sound, lights + laser shows, to featuring and producing big name artists at Studios\u2026\n\nI does this. Using FL Studio, I have programmed lights and lasers, video fx, and ran sound for acts that have performed at the Super Bowl. Apart from the creativity and know how, FL Studio stayed out of my way and allowed me to utilize it as the perfect toolbox in my Pro Audio career.  \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are tons of evil software companies *cough* Adobe. But there are plenty of companies that are made by professionals for professionals. Image Line is one of those companies. I have brought three licenses from them over the span of 15 years. All of them are still in use, get me the latest version of the software, and nothing in their action makes me believe that they will renege on their Lifetime Updates policy.\n\nNow, the important part. Why do I care if \u201cXYZ Commercial Software is on Linux and why does the Arch community have to care?\u201d\n\nFOSS is the back bone of technology. Pipewire is an audio-server that handles real-time audio handling and routing of both digital and hardware I/O. If I want my YouTube video routed to my DAW, processed, and routed back out to my OBS stream, ASIO and CoreAudio are unable to do this real time without janky workarounds or hardware loopback capabilities. On Linux, every hardware and Digital \nI/O can be routed real-time. Before some fanboy comes and says \u201cWindows/MacOS can do that, you\u2019re just stupid\u201d, just know Pipewire and it\u2019s predecessor Jack could route real-time audio as many times per program/hardware I/O as your CPU would allow, would allow it regardless of DRM protection, and would do it free of charge.  And keep in mind, even on native Windows, FL Studio cannot achieve this level of kernel/OS level routing (nor can any other Windows DAW for that matter). \n\nAre Microsoft/Apple incapable of releasing a Kernel/OS level audio server that can route any audio both physical and digital to any other physical or digital I/O? Nope, there is definitely a monetary reason for crippling OS capabilities. Even if they didn\u2019t want to spend the money developing the software, they could add FOSS code to their OS allowing this. Pipewire is FOSS with absolutely no limitations. \n\nBefore anyone recommends a workaround or solution, just know that I have compiled more custom kernels and tested more versions of Wine than I care to remember. Real Time Audio for non native Linux apps is not a thing. Maybe some smaller VST programs but not full DAWs like Fl Ableton etc. \n\nArch is the community that I feel is the most pragmatic about FOSS and Linux. For 90% of the world, the Linux desktop has been ready for a decade now. For the niche professionals and gamers, we have more work to do before the Linux desktop is prime time. \n\nI know many of us are serious about FOSS and Linux for the sake of privacy and freedom in the age of information but we have to embrace commercial software developers as imperfect allies / necessary evil at worst or the chance to contribute to a better technological future at best. \n\nLet me know your thoughts or ways to better petition Software Publishers to release Linux Native versions of their commercial software. \n\nEdit: Forgive the grammar, my phone was laggy typing this. \n\n\n",

            "FL Studio works with wineasio, which lets you have realtime audio (it maps a virtual ASIO device to JACK). Everything that connects to JACK can now connect to FL Studio.\n\nEnterprise software coming to Linux will happen naturally when there's a market. Companies that make enterprise software don't hate Linux, Image-Line devs specifically even have fixed a few issues that only happen under wine, despite it being an unsupported configuration! The only reason why there isn't a Linux-native version is because it costs dev time and almost nobody wants it (comparatively speaking).\n\nEnterprise software coming to Linux isn't the gateway to desktop Linux, it's the other way around. Once using a Linux-based OS on their desktop becomes appealing to consumers (the average person!) - enterprises will follow naturally.",
            "This stuff absolutely DOES NOT exist in Windows: is absolutely unsuitable for low latency processing. I have done many experiments in this area. It distorts catastrophically at low buffer sizes even when the processing hardware is at 30% capacity. Hardware interrupts cannot be avoided or reprioritized and that's a big issue. DPC latency is basically a black box that says \"fuck you\" to some hardware combos. Only Linux allows you to patch in a real time kernel and that's why things like the Waves Server and the Midas HD96 run on Linux, while DiGiCo and Avid do processing in FPGAs and only handles control data thru a Windows 7 interface..\n\nFL is a superb DAW btw, as a recorder/mixer/masterer I'm a Reaper man myself but if I was any kind of beatmaker that's what I'd use.",

            "First, archlinux has nothing to do with any of this by essence. They provide a blending edge distro with almost always an untouched and quickly tested version of a big amount of foss software and allow community to easily \"package\" the other apps (foss or not) with an unverified and unsecure AUR system. All of this is made by a limited amount of people, with a limited time, and no cash. I hope no serious company will use archlinux to make or distribute its software on it, that would be dumb.\n\nThat said, I also hope that more software at least come to Linux, and the situation evolve, slowly, as Linux (for desktop) become more and more equiped with professional tools (drivers, audio/video stacks, security,...). For pro audio producing now we have a great stack, for video producing we almost have it (we miss some things in the wayland protocols, but some are working hard to get it done), for 3d creation Blender is a great Linux professional app, and gaming is pushed by Valve and some foss makers to see enough games working to swich to Linux.\n\nBut we can't blame companies with limited resources to come to Linux because it has a development cost and a small user market. And big companies... don't wait for them, they'll come when they can't have the choice anymore.\n\nWhat you can do to help is to support companies coming to Linux (in your usage for music producing, daws and vsts), and motivate \"coworkers\" (other professionals) to test easy distributions like Ubuntu or maybe Fedora.\n\nAs for you specific example (I see you try to have a global discussion, but your frustration come mainly from FL Studio and music production), I have some things to say, being also (at a small level) a music producer :\n\n- pipewire is a great pro-audio stack, but it is still young and not completly stable. But it has enough capability to be the most complete stack, above Coreaudio (we are digging to find the Windows one...). Jack is older and stable, but harder to use (unless you use it since years and learned all its subtilities).\n\n- Coreaudio has multiple ways to get things done with audio routing, you can agregate inputs and outputs on a virtual device, and send virtual/physical devices to multiple outputs without lag or heavy processing, and that is native features (I've done this weeks ago, it works very well). One thing is made by third party software (BlackHole for my usage, free and opensource), routing system output to an input, to get the system output shown as an input into a daw. But Coreaudio is very capable and mature.\n\n- nothing to say about Windows stack, nothing pro by default and Asio isn't perfect, nor integrated.\n\n- as said by someone else, FL studio works on Linux with a wine+jack backend, this is a first step, other uncompatible daws don't have it, if you use FL, use it on Linux and tell devs this is your main system. You can also change to a Linux compatible daw (foss or not, Ardour, Zrythm, Bitwig, Reaper), but I don't think they will have all the capabilities you need.\n\n- I am on MacOS for music producing instead of Linux because I use archlinux for everything else since +10 years and I have too much instabilities to get it working everytime I want to (updates sometimes changes the behavior and I can't wait for a fix or take time to find the issue when I need to create). I don't use another more stable Linux like Ubuntu because I have only another powerful host being a macmini, and don't want to dualboot anymore.\n\n- I try to push Linux in a way, because after starting with Reason on Windows years ago (and cry with Asio), I changed to Bitwig who support Linux to trash my Windows installation. Paying for Bitwig is a way to show that this is a good thing to be open to Linux (and oh boy, this daw is so good... another topic). I launch it to Linux to test and master my songs sometimes when I can, to let them see I use Linux. I also buy mainly (a few) vsts available on Linux and try to send messages to other companies to ask them to add a Linux compability.\n\nI hope to see more professional software and more motivated companies on Linux but I already see a lot of good things happening in this way.",
