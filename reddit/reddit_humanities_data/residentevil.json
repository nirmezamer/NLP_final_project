            "It's worth noting they have confirmed no new announcements beyond the games in the title.",
            "New Dead Rising content? I really hope it's a sign, but the cynic inside me says they're simply just releasing it.",
            "Its a lot to hope for, but if we could just get the combo weapons (and by extension more weapons as a whole) in dead rising 1, I couldnt ask for anything more. A remaster is fine, but it feels like one of those games where a remaster doesnt really serve anything since the graphics were never the appeal of the game to begin with.",
            "I would watch just to hear more about the Dear Rising remaster (which should honestly just turn into a full remake if theyre replacing the voice acting, but whatever).",
            "They are calling it remaster but that new Dead Rising version looks like remake, but it's 1:1 original not like Resident Evil modern remakes, whole new games.",
            "I hope that Path of Goddess will have also a physical release",
            "Ecstatic about Dead Rising getting something new. Going to try out Path of the Goddess when it comes out on gamepass. Every time I see the vibrant art style though, I just wish we could get another Okami game.",
            "I guess no RE9 in FY25 then.",
            "From the looks of it it will probably be just a simple remaster, maybe we will be surprised with something for it.  \nHowever even if its just a remaster, it still shows that Capcom remembers about Dead Rising franchise.   \nSimply put not all hope is lost, and Dead may rise again in due time.",
            "This\n\nMaybe if we are lucky we will at least see it on GOG in the future?"
