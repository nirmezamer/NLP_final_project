            "Aren't like all the titles you just named backward compatible and NOT going away after the 360 store shuts down?",
            "Mmm but if i am not wrong most of these games still have a lot of loose content in DLCs that are not on sale. I think their modern versions have better prices for the full game when they are on sale.",
            "Remember Me is one hell of a game. It's got a magnificent mood and atmosphere. Killer soundtrack, too. Grab it. It's an unpolished gem. I like games like this. For example, back in day, I really fell in love with Hydrophobia from the XBLA due to similar reasons.",
            "Does anyone have a good list of everything that can be sorted by price? Navigating the website is a pain in the ass and I feel like I have to search specific titles to find anything  I can't just find a list of \"360 games on heavy sale\"",

            "According to the tweet, they only had the time now to celebrate and threw a party.",
            "It was an instant classic. Completely changed the fate of the studio. Not saying they'd go bankrupt, but there are games that clearly shift the destiny of a company.\n\nRE7 did too but remaking the older games was a pretty good choice that allowed new people to get into the franchise.",
            "I'm glad Ada got a cake along with Leon and Claire from their shot on the cover.",
            "Definitely deserved imo. No over exaggeration, I've been gaming since I was 4 years old. The first game I ever played was Sonic 2. the second was the first Resident Evil. It's my favorite video game series, no contest. I say all that to say that after I beat RE2R when it came out, I remember constantly thinking to myself, \" Is this my favorite game of all time?\". Sat on it for years waiting for the excitement of this game to wear off....it hasn't. This is, without a doubt, the best game ever made to me. It's exactly how I always pictured a modern RE game to play. It had everything I ever wanted from a Resident Evil game. Yeah, it sucks that they didn't adapt the zapping system from the original, but I just can't overlook how they perfected the formula imo.\n\nTLDR: This is my best game ever made, so I'm happy to hear.",
            "RE5 is still the highest selling, it\u2019s sold about 14.5 million actually, if you include the re-releases, which many publications don\u2019t. It\u2019s confusing for many people with conflicting numbers here and there, but currently Resident Evil 5 is still number 1.\n\n\nCongratulations to RE2R for being as new as it is and being such a success!",
            "As a new fan of the RE game franchise I\u2019m glad that it sold so much and is doing well. It was really addicting once I got to it and I replayed it 4 times back to back. I\u2019m now on RE5 and loving the franchise so much. Blasphemous but I did not enjoy RE1 at all.",
            "It's not the best selling game of the franchise tho...  \nRE4 original has still sold more copies with 14million. RE5 is even higher with 15.6 million. Even RE6 is higher than RE2R with 14.4 million.",
            "The game that got me into the series very well deserved",
            "Game is very good, also helps that it's almost always on sale for like $10 lol"
