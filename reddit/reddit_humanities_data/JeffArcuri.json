Keeping the cost down has always been important to me and I\u2019ve been assured that 90% of my tickets are under $75. \n\nI don\u2019t handle this stuff as it\u2019s very overwhelming, so my agent will try and answer questions in this thread. \n\nI appreciate you guys so much and I hope to see you this fall!!\n",
