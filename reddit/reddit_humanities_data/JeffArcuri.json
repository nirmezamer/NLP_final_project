Using any third party will be scam tickets that will charge you way more then the actual tickets through the real ticketing site.\n\nI\u2019ve received a lot of messages and read a lot of comments regarding the exorbitant price of tickets. Keeping the cost down has always been important to me and I\u2019ve been assured that 90% of my tickets are under $75. \n\nI don\u2019t handle this stuff as it\u2019s very overwhelming, so my agent will try and answer questions in this thread. \n\nI appreciate you guys so much and I hope to see you this fall!!\n",

Sucked that people were trying to interrupt him a ton but you can\u2019t control that, even with that he\u2019s truly the best comedian of our time. His crowd work is incredible. Even the other comedians were great too!! \n\nIdk if Jeff is on Reddit or sees these comments but you really do have a gift and help make peoples lives become better by bringing joy and comedy to them. I haven\u2019t laughed this hard in a while and all I can say is - Jeff if you see this thank you so much and God Bless you. I wish we could have met in person so I could say you were amazing. You truly made our trip special and I can\u2019t wait until next time!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
