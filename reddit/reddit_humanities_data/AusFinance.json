            "A property I had my eye on has been marked as \u201cSold\u201d on realestate dot com. Unlike other listings that has the sold price, this one says \u201cContact agent\u201d. \n\nIs this common practice (I haven\u2019t seen it on other sold listings til now) and anyone know why this is? Thanks.",
            "I got pre-approval for properties up to 650k, but I think the variable interest of 6.57% p.a is a bit high, and monthly repayments of $3700 is a bit much for a minimum income of $4400 monthly\n\nMy broker seemed to overinflate my income/ or I miscalculated (maybe she took into account my tax return?)\n~~~\nAnyway, I'm signing up for the shared equity scheme, but I exchanged contract with a seller, business-day 2/5\n\nShould I withdraw my contract, and hope I get approved for the shared equity scheme? The repayments will be less since I'm borrowing less.\n\nThe only con is I forgo a decent villa at $645k, and lose the 0.25% deposit. I'm stressed on the fence\n\n~~~\nEdit: my deposit is 40k, with 20k from parents but I don't wanna rely on them, so let's say it's 40k",
            "Been dealing with an investment group that \"specialise\" in properties, We are looking at buying an IP and continuing to rent until we generate enough equity to buy a house in a capital city... But the more i look at the houses and price trends in the surround estate where they want us to buy and build the more i end up scratching my head.\u00a0\nIe new build 4 bedroom 2 car 440m\u00b2 block under strict covenant laws is high $680s .... Similar houses on bigger blocks, albeit a few years older are selling for 580~660...\u00a0\nWe really want to rent it at a reasonable price through a decent real estate and provide somewhere nice for people to live affoardably while they help us pay of part of the loan essentially so its a bit of a win win. But am i just a newb or would you too be concerned over the fact that the surrounding houses are cheaper to buy than build.",
            "I have a house. I have about $350k equity. I want to sell my house to move to our preferred location. \n\nI don\u2019t really want to sell first to live with in-laws while we look/buy. What options would you recommend?",
            "I see a lot. not sure why other than to get your details and try to sell you similar houses.",
            "Usually occurs when the sale price is not that great or when the agent just wants people to put in their database.",
            "Is this a joint or single application?\n\nYour income will definitely not be enough to cover that sort of repayments.\n\nNo risk management team is going to approve that loan",
            "You should ask to see more detail at what's happened here. It's not clear how big your loan sizes is (vs properties up-to value). How big is your deposit?\n\nIf you are saying your after-tax monthly income is 4400, I'm assuming you mean pre-tax income is ballpark 65k-69k, so a 650k house is 10x your income. If you have a regular 5-10% deposit to go, then this seems like a LOT of house.\n\nSomething in these numbers doesn't stack up. Broker looks sus here.",
            "You need a bridging loan.",
            "If you have 350k equity, it sounds like your current property may be in a good location. You could ask the sales agents if they have buyers interested in off market properties that would be willing to accept a longer settlement period while you look/buy."

        "content": "Currently as a millennial it feels like cost of living and inflation and the high interest rates will make it impossible to enjoy the same quality of life as our parents. \n\nIt feels that the common wisdom of investing into super and making sacrifices to afford a better later life or early retirement is kind of outdated and that doing that will not help much at all. \n\nThis is almost backed up by the fact that millennial and gen z have lower rates of investment and are kind of prioritising lifestyle spending as a 'screw it' kind of mentality.\n\nBut I'm curious. Is this just our current world view and recency bias making it seem like the future is screwed? Will things get better again? Should I stay the course and make my sacrifices and continue investing or do I need to enjoy my lifestyle more?\n\nI'm curious to hear from older people who may have experienced rising interest rates and how that felt at the time. Was it pretty bleak at the time? Did it look like you overreacted in hindsight?",

            "The most important thing anyone can do during any kind of economic downturn is to keep their job. I know it sounds glib, but it really is the key to absolutely everything else.\n\n\nThere's no secret to anything else. Delayed gratification is a thing during good times and bad - in many ways it's more important during the tough times to maintain a buffer if things don't go as well as hoped. That said, you still need to live and stay sane.",

Lastly have a fund set aside for entertainment so you don\u2019t go crazy.",
            "Happy people rarely complain publicly about anything. \n\nWhat I mean by that is that you need to be careful how much weight you put in any form of social media posting, reading or doom scrolling. \n\nFocus on what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re learning. How you\u2019re growing as a person. You\u2019ll attract the same. \n\nStay the course. I\u2019m 46 and am really starting to be super aware of my work/life mortality. I\u2019ve been working since I was 11. Full time since I was 15. I\u2019ll retire in 14 years not because I\u2019ve made no errors financially, I\u2019ve made plenty, truthfully it\u2019s heaps, really. I\u2019ll retire by 60 because I\u2019ve taken an active interest in my financial life. I truely started doing it at about 40. I wasted half my work life modding cars, partying and doing what I wanted right then, in the moment, with no view to my future. The only future thing I did was salary sacrifice a small about to my Super. \n\nI\u2019m yet to find anyone who I deal with through my life or my job who are upset that they\u2019ll retire \u2018on time\u2019, on their terms because they took an interest in their financial life. \n\nLife comes at you fast. Soon enough I\u2019ll be 50, then 55 and working out a transition to retirement. I met my wife 10 years ago, it feels like 2 years ago. We just built/bought our house in 2021 and moved in 2022. Stay the course.\n\nEdit:\n\nHave a read of The Fourth Turning and it\u2019s new addition The Fourth Turning is Here.

The best you can do is swim as competently as you can.\n\nAnd adopting a cheerful and grateful disposition will serve you through all seasons.\n\nMore practically. As much as it may hurt in the immediate, the human animal is extremely good at adaptation. And periods of frugality will reset your expectations quickly. You'll find yourself just as happy with less very quickly. And that's surely a good thing! \ud83d\ude0a",
            "This is a short period of shit. \n\nWhen i was young, we lived in a caravan park, and had no money. Chrissy present was a stick, bday pressy was a rock. we didn't know how we were going to survive.\n\nI left home in '93. Interest rates were 10% (coming down from 17%) on their way down. I was on shit wage and just started working. Rent was $150 pw for 2 bedder unit. It took 4 years to save up for a deposit by working a second job. interest rates fell to about 8% by 1997 and was time to buy as rent was the same as mortgage. Being young, i didn't realise there were things like Rates, Insurance, Body Corp, etc, so things were even tighter. wasn't sure how we were going to survive, so got a 3rd job. \n\nBy 99, rates were down to 6.5%, things were better, started getting a few pay rises (not anything great). Then 2000 hit, and rates started to rise to about 8%. No one knew if we were going back to the bad old days of 17% or not. Didn't know how we were going to survive. Was short lived though as rates came down, and things got better.\n\nWe also had 2008, but we had been through it before, so didn't worry as much, even when rates went to 10%. but that to was also short lived. What i'm saying is that every couple of years, things are shit, we are just going through one of those times. it will get better for you. don't believe all these \"the sky is falling\" idiots. these shit periods help you get through the next shit period, use it as a learning exercise.\n\nAnswer: yes, you are overreacting, but everyone does.",

Otherwise we can't retain or attract people in high demand positions that we need, e.g. surgeons, trades, cybersecurity, and many others.\n\nNonetheless, we need to discourage politicians from legislating major tax changes across more than a couple of years.

Why not serve the people, like the govt is supposed to?\n\nIt only drives inflation if the money is used to increase discretionary. If it's just bridging the gap between inflation and wage growth then it should probably just help people dig themselves out of a hole, I suppose.\n\nPersonally, all of my rebates and tax cuts gets dumped into the motgage, which isn't inflationary. It's not deflationary either though",
            "It is a risk but certain rebates don't add officially to inflation and the tax cuts were factored into the RBA's numbers awhile ago.\n\nRemember everyone complaining about the government doing nothing about the cost of living (especially loud around the time of the Referendum)?

For someone who makes $10,000 per week after tax, $1,000 is a drop in the bucket.\n\nSame with tax cut. $200 tax saved per paycheck is a lot if your paycheck is $1,000. $1,000 tax saved per paycheck is no big deal if your paycheck is $10,000.",
