            "Been dealing with an investment group that \"specialise\" in properties, We are looking at buying an IP and continuing to rent until we generate enough equity to buy a house in a capital city... But the more i look at the houses and price trends in the surround estate where they want us to buy and build the more i end up scratching my head.\u00a0\nIe new build 4 bedroom 2 car 440m\u00b2 block under strict covenant laws is high $680s .... Similar houses on bigger blocks, albeit a few years older are selling for 580~660...\u00a0\nWe really want to rent it at a reasonable price through a decent real estate and provide somewhere nice for people to live affoardably while they help us pay of part of the loan essentially so its a bit of a win win. But am i just a newb or would you too be concerned over the fact that the surrounding houses are cheaper to buy than build.",

Sure build quality is highly variable and something to be weary about. But be aware houses just cost much more to build today with inflation and cost of materials/labour",
            "lots of apartments can be had for 600k, you'll likely have to pay LMI (\\~10k additional added on to loan) unless you can find a favourable lender or qualify due to profession. You'll likely be able to get low or free stamp duty especially if you're a first home buyer",

First year just sucked because we put all of our savings into this house, then had to buy furniture etc. it\u2019s taken a good 12 months to dig ourselves out of that hole because saving has become much harder with interest rates being what they  are. We\u2019ve now got a little buffer and steadily putting money away each month. Nowhere near what we\u2019d like to but it is what it is.",
            "We bought at the end of last year, and sound similar - didn\u2019t overextend on mortgage, have relatively good incomes etc. I knew the mortgage repayments were going to be a shock (double our rent payments) but I wasn\u2019t prepared for all the extra costs (it had been a rental for a number of years so wasn\u2019t very well looked after - we repainted and did the floors before moving in, and then in the first 3 months had to replace the dishwasher, oven, heating ducting, and spend about $4k \u201cpossum proofing\u201d \ud83d\ude05). We\u2019ve now fixed all the essential things (for now at least - I am worried the heating and hot water will go soon), and so are in a phase of \u201cnice to have\u201d improvements. The way we are tackling these is by putting money each month into a \u201chouse fund\u201d - once we build that up enough we can do the next thing we want. I find that\u2019s helping us not spend like crazy, but still work towards improvements. We do also have about 6 months worth\u2019 of expenses in an emergency fund in case any disastrous happens (we were lucky to have a guarantor arrangement so didn\u2019t have to use all our savings on the deposit).  Each month we are putting between $500-$1500 in the house fund, a holiday fund, and our savings (all offset accounts) - but when we were renting we were saving around $4-5k a month so it\u2019s very different and there is a significant mindset shift!  But even if we aren\u2019t \u201csaving\u201d that much one month, we are still paying off a mortgage, building equity, and hopefully improving the value of our home too - at least you\u2019re paying off an investment \ud83d\ude42  1-2 more rate rises will suck, but if we can all get through the next 6-12 months, I\u2019m hoping there will be some relief after that!",

            "I won't deny it's a hard slog.  Really hard slog for the first few years.  What made it easier is to do fortnightly payments instead of monthly.  Turns out to be one extra repayment a year.\n\nAnd yes, the first few years of a mortgage is the hardest.  All I can suggest to keep plodding along.  If you and your partner get a small bonus, put that onto the mortgage, every little bit helps.  I've even gone as far as putting birthday  onto the mortgage.",
