            "Hello! I am not sure if this is the right place but I figured I would try here first. I got this thing after buying a 'sewing room' from an estate sale. I.E. fabric, feet, rulers, cutting tables, cutters, shelving. etc etc. No one there knew what it was but I digress.\n\nI can't add much more information than the pictures. No sewing machines were part of the room and no one there knew the lady (it was run by an estate selling company). I don't want to just toss it since everything I got ended up having some utility with something else in the 'room'. And it looks used/worn so.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. The local stores had no idea either!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x04djmgnig8d1.jpeg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b270055d8a2a2f457281ad0d5c7e6385b7e9de7",
            "How to sew a full lining to a dress and leave no gaps? \n\nHi! I am strungling to think of how to poperply fullt line a dress. The dress is made of sleeveless bodice and a full circle skirt. It has an invisible zipper in the back. I have a dress sewn like exactly like this but I cant figure out how it's done. \n\nI want that the lining would be sewn together with shell fabric not only in the bodice, however on the bottom of the dress skirt as well so it would not be floating around. \n\nI am having a hard time thinking on in what order and how to sew and reach all these places when sewing lining and shell fabric together and fully close the gaps on the bodice, the zipper and the bottom of the skirt. \n\nAny help would be very appreciated! \ud83e\udef6",

I got these jeans tailored, I asked to just have the waist taken in (so it will be reversible when I gain weight). Unfortunately, these darts were added. I don\u2019t really like the way they look or feel, and was wondering if anyone knows if it\u2019s reversible?",

I don't think they are the first to do this but their video was the one i stumbled upon and made me want to make my own.\n\nmy question is, it is okay to take inspiration from their design and make it for myself. The inspo is coming from a creator who has their own small sustainable brand and is selling the garment for over 300$ and I know I can make it myself.\n\nthanks",

            "Instead of sewing a bandana, I figured it'd be extra light and breathable if I crocheted it, all those holes! Well turns out I'm pretty bad at crocheting and the back looks horrible lol. Was gonna line the back of it but not exactly sure what to use, was thinking cotton gauze is about the lightest thing I can think of but I figured I'd ask if anyone had any other recommendations",

            "The bodice and sleeves are the Anna Allen Anthea Blouse. No modification on the sleeves. My measurements call for a size 16, but I made a 14 and graded it in significantly on the side seams \u2013 down to an 8. I shortened the bodice to about 4 inches below the armpit. I omitted buttons.\n\nThe main panel of the skirt is made of two rectangles, each made with the full 44\" width of the fabric. I used the remaining fabric to make three shorter panels to create the second tier. It has self-drafted inseam pockets. \n\nThis was my first project after finally buying myself a serger, and the insides of this dress are beautiful! Very proud of that. \n\nFabric is an Indian block print cotton purchased from Etsy. It's lightweight and breezy! I used almost every bit of the 5 yards I bought.",

            "IKEA dungarees!\n\nAt long last I have made something from this famous fabric. I'm so happy with these, they have so much room\n\nOne thing I'll say is this is a fairly thick fabric and frays a little. It'll be worth zig zag stitching or overlocking your pieces/seams as you go\n\nThe last dungarees I made were made from the Tiffany Jumpsuit but I've used that shape to draft a more boxy shape, straight onto this fabric. I'll draft an actual pattern to have a base to work from, that way I can play around more with this silhouette \n\nThe joy this garment gives me \ud83d\ude2d",

The dress came together without any issues, and I didn't need to adjust anything except shortening the length of the skirt by about 20 cm/8\" (I'm only 160 cm/5'3\"). As I opted to line it, I chose not to follow the instructions, and instead just put it together as I usually do, which I think worked well. \n\nMust say I am super happy with my accidental pattern matching at the center front waist seam!\n\nFabric is a lovely polyester crepe with a nice weight to it, bought at tyg.se. It is lined with red polyester crepe chiffon from Swedish fabric store Ohlssons tyger.",
