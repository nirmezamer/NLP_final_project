            "Instead of sewing a bandana, I figured it'd be extra light and breathable if I crocheted it, all those holes! Well turns out I'm pretty bad at crocheting and the back looks horrible lol. Was gonna line the back of it but not exactly sure what to use, was thinking cotton gauze is about the lightest thing I can think of but I figured I'd ask if anyone had any other recommendations",
            "Hi! How do I prevent the shirring from coming undone next time? I made a dress using the half shirred/one seam fabric from Joanns and on washing about a quarter of the shirring came undone on one side of the seam - the side that was on the bottom while I was sewing. If the image doesnt post in the comment I will include a link. Thank you!",
            "Can you recommend a sewing machine please? \n\nHello, im looking into getting a sewing machine, im a beginner but i'd like something that would last for a good few years! I want to get a Singer sewing machine but i have no idea about which one to get! Can you recommend a good quailty sewing machine? I have a budget around 300 dollars (might seem too little but thats 10.000 turkish liras, it was really hard to save all that :\"))",
            "Brother vs. Bernina? \nHi everyone. I have been sewing since a year now and my current machine (Singer Promise) doesnt have everything I need. I sometimes need to sew over multiple layers and elastic fabrics and it often jams. Now that I am working more and more on my clothes sewing projects I need a good machine that will accompany me to the advanced level, I am looking for something easy to use and powerful at the same time. I saw the new Bernina B480 and I fell in love, especially since it also has an in-built guide which tells you what needle or foot to use for each fabric, etc. However I see that Brother also has quite a few options and during some online digging it seems to be also a favorite. However I only worked with my Singer machine so far so I am looking for advice as to what is better for what I need. I make clothes, no quilting and I am also looking into embroidery. Thank you!",
            "I have a 100% silk tie which has been ironed on low heat and now there are small scorch marks. Is there anything I can do to fix it?",
            "This may be an obvious thing to lots of people, but are patterns on Etsy mostly all scams? Ive noticed different vendors using the exact same formatting in patterns and Im pretty sure even the exact same patterns themselves.",
            "I'm looking for rolls of cloth as similar as (or exactly like) bandana cloth. About 2cm in width would be perfect. Any ideas for store fronts or an Amazon link?",
            "I'm sorry if this has been posted a thousand times before, but I Googled with no luck as I have zero knowledge of the sewing world. I'm trying to fluff up my dog bed, it's the Best Friends by Sheri bed with 2 tubes of filling around and one circular pillow for the bottom. I'm going to get more filling but the fabric that shapes it is falling apart. What's that thin white fabric called that you shape the filling into that gets stuffed into the actual bed cover? Any Amazon links with recommendations would be very much appreciated!",
            "Hi-- I will be traveling to Miami Beach for a few weeks in July and will have some downtime to (hopefully) work on some sewing projects.  I'd rather not haul my machine/equipment down with me, since I'll be flying-- is there a place nearby with rentable sewing space, or a shop that would let me rent some time with a machine and basic equipment?  Thanks so much!",
            "I'm cleaning my outdoor patio cushions by removing the casings for washing. The back pillows contain a poly filling encased in some type of mesh material which is desintegrating when I try to remove the casings. What type of material is that and should I choose the same material to sew as its replacement"

            "Sergers are a game changer if you want to make apparel! I recently financed one I wanted it so bad\n\nTension looks pretty good but know it will change from fabric to fabric sometimes, and theres lots of cool stitches other than the 4 thread overlock. Have fun!",

            "Spent so much time on this! ",
            "A new serger is supposed to sew perfectly if all the tension wheels are in the normal range and the fabric is neither extremely light or heavy :)",
            "What a thoughtful gift and definitely something to brag about!",
            "Nice! \n\nI had the great fortune of mine coming pre-threaded. I've got a coverstitch machine coming next week (also a Juki!) and I'm really hoping it come pre-threaded, LOL",
