If you use any open source application that you might like to contribute to, to maybe fix a specific bug, you can check out the webpage for it to find where they host the code. If you can fix it (well), usually you can read the contributors guide for said software project, and submit your fix to them.",

Or they decided to adopt a toolkit, like libadwaita, over there (they have Kirigami, but even that doesn't seem to be unanimous). Mauikit is a good example of \"prettier KDE IMHO\", but it's a side project, not KDE itself... Anyway.",
            "Yes, for me, everything just felt out of place, and like each window was developed by separate dev with his own view on how design should be. I know people low KDE for its customisability and that new things usually appear there faster (like HDR, VRR, you name it), but it really lacks design language uniformity. But that's Linux in a nutshell, with God level programmers, and lack of any designers"
