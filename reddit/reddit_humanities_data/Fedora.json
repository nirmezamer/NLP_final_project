        "content": "Hey there,\n\nI have recently installed Fedora, since I am looking for an OS that I can replace my windows with. In the past I have tried to replace Windows, but there were always some trade-offs I had to make and I was not willing to do this. Nowadays Linux has progressed very much and it is actually way nicer than the current state Windows is in (im using Windows 10 on my PC and 11 on my laptop). I don't even need to start with the Recall thing, because Windows already was bloated. I mean even if I uninstall the Xbox App it reinstalls itself\n\nI have already experimented with different Linux Derivatives like Debian and Arch, but there was always one thing one distro offered, that the other didn't in it's native state. To be honest, I really liked the do-it-yourself approach on Arch, but for me it is too time consuming.\n\nThat's where Fedora comes into the spotlight: I installed it and most settings were just as I wanted them to be. Hard to explain why, but I like it. But still, I have some questions to ask, because I want to adjust it to my workflow.\n\n**1 Display settings**\n\nI have two monitors, one 4k and one HD monitor. The problem is, that the HD monitor feels overscaled even with 100% and I can't size it down in the settings. On the 4k monitor everything is fine (except for firefox, I had to set the scaling here manually to 1.25, but thats ok). Is there a way to make the scaling of the monitors more native like Windows does? (in Windows this works fine, and I already have enabled fractional scaling, but it still does not seem to do the job).\n\n**2 O365-Suite**\n\nPersonally I like Office365. Yes I know that there are alternatives like LibreOffice & Co. but Word and Excel just feel natural to use for me. I think LibreOffice will also work, but since I am still studying, I have some courses where I will need to do collaborative work on Word/Excel/Powerpoint Documents synced in Onedrive and thats when Office is really powerful.\n\n**3 iTunes & Co.**\n\nI have been using iPhones for ages and therefore there was always a need for iTunes. Nowadays I have to admit that I don't do that much backups anymore locally, but there are a few times, when iTunes comes in handy. I know that there is an older version of iTunes working for Wine and Bottles, but did anyone make it work with a newer version?\n\n**3.1 Apple Music**\n\nI already found a replacement for Apple Music. On Arch I was using [Apple Music Desktop](https://github.com/Alex313031/apple-music-desktop). I was thinking about switching to Cider, but there were not only positive news about the devs. What would you be recommending me to use?\n\n**3.2 Apple TV** \n\nSince I am using Apple TV a lot, I was looking for an equivalent like cider, etc. but I could not find one. I like the Apple TV App for Windows, because I can also watch my movies there, something I can not do with the web version.\n\n**4 Dual Boot or Virtual Machine**\n\nSince I will need some windows software occasionally, I am wondering if I should go with a Dual Boot Solution or a Virtual Machine. Is it possible to run Word, iTunes, etc. straight out of the VM and connect it with my file system? I would love to just let the VM run in the background and link the Work Icon in the Gnome applications tab. (Bottles or Wine do something similar, even if they work a little bit different).\n\nOr would a dual boot be more recommended?\n\nI hope I didn't crush you with this wall of text, but I would really like to switch to Linux permanently. I think I will have a lot more questions in the future, depending how successful my switch attempt will be :)",

            "You can either use O365 on the web (with limited features), or check out OnlyOffice. It's more compatible with MS Office documents and the UI is very close to MS Office. More so than LibreOffice. \n\nIf OnlyOffice is not good enough, you will have to stick with Windows. There are tutorials to get Windows to run in a Linux VM, but it's not simple, and gets worse with Windows 11. Not like running another Linux distro in a VM, which is super easy. \n\nWindows apps that work perfectly with Wine are mostly quite old, or relatively simple. You probably won't be able to get any modern version of O365 working with Wine or Bottles. I've never seen anyone show off successfully running anything but older versions of the MS Office desktop apps. \n\nSome people who still have to use things like Adobe apps or O365 just can't move to Linux completely. Dual-booting is a pain, but it's probably the only practical option unless you can live with alternatives like OnlyOffice. \n\nOr there's also WPS Office, which is supposed to have the best compatibility with MS Office documents, but it's not really open source. \n\nOnlyOffice is available as a Flatpak from Flathub.org. It's very easy to install and check it out, once you get the Flathub repo set up.",
            "For office there's this suite called WPS office, kinda bloated but it's basically a copy os MS office, you can get it via flatpak. For virtual machine if you are tech savvy enough you can set up a passthrough, it will get you native performance.",
            "If you have a powerful PC with a lot of ram there's a way to run a VM that seamlessly operates with the OS\n\nSo like MS Word has an app shortcut, and when you open it it opens MS Word in the VM and passes that part to your screen so it's almost like it's a native app.\n\nI think it's called WinApps"
