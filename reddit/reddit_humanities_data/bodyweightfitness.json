            "Hello! I have a question.\n\nI am trying to work my abs so I've been trying to work down the leg raise progressions. I can do the lying leg raises, deadbugs and hollow body holds quite well, but I struggle with the hanging leg raises. I feel the really intense burn in my abs when I do the lying variations (I use a tensioned band under my lower back to ensure I keep my lower back on the floor), but I just can't seem to connect with my abs when hanging. I think it's my hip flexors taking over so I just don't feel anything in my abs when hanging. For reference I can do a hollow body hold for 40 seconds. Should I get better at the lying variations before trying the hanging leg raises again? Any help is appreciated.",

        "content": "I have seen many people doing calisthenics without any posterior pelvic tilt to safeguard their lower back. Especially street workout guys. All I hear about PPT is in the youtube channels and this sub. For me, PPT during pushups and rows is achieved when I squeeze my buttcheeks inwards (like at the top of a glute bridge) and my femurs seem to rotate outwards. I think this is a correct way. In this process, my obliques become rock solid more than my rectus abdominis.\n\nBut what is really the purpose of PPT during pushups, rows, pullups, dips, etc? I don't believe it is absolutely necessary otherwise almost every street workout guy would have wrecked their lower backs. \n\nDoes PPT or no PPT change how certain muscles are activated or inhibited? Are spinal erectors somehow inhibited during PPT? Atleast, I feel so. Does keeping the normal pelvic angle work the erectors and other muscles more i.e. translate to more strength gains overall?\n\nCan someone explain?",

            "I think what\u2019s important is, not the exact posture (APT VS PPT) but that you\u2019re locking your core in place. Slack in your core on push-ups/rows make them less effective because you\u2019re taking load off of your upper body and making the load more inconsistent. Slack on pull-ups/dips leads to swaying, which eats up more energy when you\u2019re trying to stabilize and move your body.\n\nI\u2019d guess that PPT is emphasized here because that\u2019s the position that enables the glutes and abs to work the hardest to keep your core rigid. Also for most of us, our low backs and hip flexors are tight enough as is and locking yourself into APT on bodyweight movements can exacerbate that",

I don't believe it is absolutely necessary otherwise almost every street workout guy would have wrecked their lower backs.\n\n> Does PPT or no PPT change how certain muscles are activated or inhibited?

Does keeping the normal pelvic angle work the erectors and other muscles more i.e. translate to more strength gains overall?\n\n* Posterior pelvis tilt (PPT) which leads to hollow body position is mainly used in gymnastics in order to position the body into a slightly hollow position. This is most useful for generating the correct shapes to do swinging and transitional movements into strength holds. \n\n* In general, if you are strength training only then neutral pelvis is what you want to do for most everything. Some people prefer slightly hollow and slight PPT in order to have their clients/athletes avoid arching during the movement which is a common fault. \n\n* On the other hand, anterior pelvis tilt (APT) is commonly used during barbell exercises like squats and deadlifts in order to avoid rounding of the spine during those movements. Like PPT with the exercises noted in the point above, this helps to reduce the incidence of someone moving into PPT and rounded lower back. \n\nIn other words, most of the people advocating for PPT likely come from a gymnastics background or use it as a cue for slight PPT/slight hollow to avoid technique faults like arching during the movements. \n\nIf you can maintain neutral pelvis, that is ideal for virtually every exercise except those that require APT or PPT (e.g. hollow body holds, arch holds, arched back pullups, etc.)\n\n/u/HopeIsGold",
            "Lengthens the back muscles tighter for better eccentrics, moves centre of gravity forward, puts hip flexors in better position for flexion, achieved so many things",
            "I think swaying due to instability occurs because people chase progressions and start at harder progressions than they can do. Otherwise if you start at the level where you can keep your body straight without swaying and neutral spine and pelvis then is works out right.\n\nIn starting bodyweight's basic routine this advice was given I remember:\n\nFirst test out at what level you can do a set of 8 pushups. Then start at the progression below that and perform the routine 3x a week.\n\nEdit: I hope u/eshlow comes in and explain as lucidly as he does about OP's questions.",

            "> Piggybacking on OP's doubts, does maintaining PPT in calisthenics movements like pushups, rows, dips or pullups have any drawback when compared to doing them with a neutral pelvic tilt?\n\nUsually no, but people can overexaggerate the hollow like they can arch to become a technique fault. You see that with front lever a lot along with pushups and planks... people want to hollow more to make the movement easier.\n\nInjury wise no, unless someone has some pre-existing injury that hurts with the pelvis and back rounded"

I've always been a \"gym girl\" (LOL!), and when I was younger, I practiced professional fencing. Because of this, I've always had a more developed lower body compared to my upper body.\n\nSince starting calisthenics, I've definitely gained strength in my arms, but I feel like there aren't enough exercises targeting the lower body, and I'm losing muscle mass in that area. I've been training every other day as suggested, and on \"rest\" days, I focus on flexibility and the skill routine posted here.\n\nI'm wondering what I can do to maintain my muscle mass in my lower body. Would it be a good idea to incorporate weightlifting at the gym for my lower body, or are there bodyweight exercises I might be overlooking that could help?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

            "Look, you don't have to be all one or the other. By and large, your legs are for lifting heavy things. Lots of bodyweight enthusiasts make the easy choice and add weighted deadlifts and squats to their upper body routines. It's fine.",

            "Weights are definitely the easiest way to train your lower body and I\u2019d primarily recommend incorporating them heavily, pun intended. \n\nThere are however a few good pure bw options for leg training. Both pistol and shrimp squats can be effective, Cossack, horse stance, and ATG split squats are good as well but are more mobility focused. Probably the best bw leg movement is Nordic curls, as they\u2019re difficult enough to not require an external load and can be done with just a nordstick and some knee padding. \n\nThere are good dynamic options too, particularly high jumps, broad jumps, and sprints (hill and regular). They\u2019re all super fun to do, are good for athleticism, and pretty easy to track progress in. \n\nAll of the above are great exercises with something to offer, but if muscle mass is your main goal you should just train with weights.",
            "Keep doing lunges that you did in fencing. Try carrying a dumbbell when lunging explosively. I'm expecting you'll increase your power and speed, your gluteal mass will increase but hopefully don't slow you down too much",
            "Training legs and particularly glutes with just bodyweight can be challenging and even limiting depending on your previous progress.\nI would say going to the gym for legs would be by far the best option, but you could also buy a set of adjustable dumbbells or a kettlebell to help you if going to the gym is not something you want to do.\n\nAlso, up the volume on glutes, that is the reason you're losing muscle on there, not enough volume to maintain it. The trouble is that calisthenics is not the best tool to do that, but adding a few sets of elevated single-led glute bridges might help you a lot anyway",
            "Squats are still a compound bodyweight movement you can just load them with weight think of it like that. Just like adding weight for dips or pullups.",
