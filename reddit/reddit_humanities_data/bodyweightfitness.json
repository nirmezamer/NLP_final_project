            "I can do chinups almost every day of the week and it is pain free but pullups tweak it. I have an injury history of ac separation and unspecified rotator cuff injury and I have done PT and regained my strength but I am limited in what exercises I can do at a stimulating intensity. Overhead push like handstand pushups or bear crawls also are painful.\u00a0",
            "Been getting back into Hindu Squats and Pushups as my daily conditioning. Feeling really good, especially on this bulk. I have separate weight training divided up through the week, but repping out 15 minutes on each exercise has been pretty nice for making me feel athletic, fit and jacked.",
            "Might it be preferable to rotate the order you do exercises on the rr,  day one start with first pair, day two start with second pair, so on.  So you change the exercises that are getting your highest energy?",
            "You could but in general, put the exercises you want to gain on the MOST first and let other things be secondary. Prioritize your goals, basically."

        "content": "I am a basketball played currently in the offseason. I am planning on expanding my training schedule to fit other aspects. Other than calisthenics (RR), I also plan on training isometrics, plyometrics, mobility and flexibility -(I already train flexibility daily.) However, I am slightly unsure where to start with isometrics. I have seen some people massively overcomplicate it while others make it very simple. I have found a decent bodyweight isometric routine on this sub inspired by paul wade's isometric book. However, I was wondering if this is enough. My goal is just to increase my tendon strength in order to reduce injury and increase explosiveness and strength. Should I add in any overcoming isometrics or leg based isometrics? Thanks. ",

        "content": "Hi! I've been working out more consistently for the last two months and recently switched to full body workouts 3 times a week with some cardio on some of the rest days. \n\nHow do you target all muscles equally without it taking forever? \n\nThis is what I'm currently doing (2 sets per workout o):\n\nLegs: squats, calf raises and glute bridges\n\nChest: pushups, dumbbell or band raises focusing the chest and chest fly with bands or trx (sorry I don't know the exact names of the exercises)\n\nBack: inverted rows on TRX, superman and TRX Y's\n\nAbs: leg raises on a pull-up bar, heel taps and side plank going up and down (sometimes I add different exercises) \n\nThen I sometimes do some biceps or triceps exercises.\n\nThis usually takes a little over an hour with warm up and stretching. Should I add more shoulder focused exercises? Given the fact that there are so many different parts in a muscle group that are targeted by different exercises, how do you train them all in a single workout? Is it even possible. \n\nThanks a lot!

            "Whole body more means that you are training upper and lower in the same workout, usually with compound movements that hit a lot of muscle at the same time, but not necessarily giving every single muscle group the same amount of attention. There's a reason bodybuilders to things like body part splits or push pull legs, it's because they need more time to add isolation movements to target specific muscles they want to bring up.\n\nSo a full body workout can be as few as 3 movements, but likely more effective with 6 or so. Choose a compound movement for push,ng, pulling, and lower body, then either choose another compound movement for each, or an isolation for each. It can also be effective to alternate which exercises you do depending on the day.",
            "If you want to go nuts you can wind up doing 98452 exercises; if you want to be minimal then like 2 or 3.  It depends how granular you want to get.\n\nThe minimalist and the primer routines on the wiki at least touch on the majority.  What you're doing is more on par with the Recommended Routine of bwsf.",
            "I know this sub is based around the RR. But to answer the question, I don\u2019t think you can realistically effectively hit all muscles in a full body workout. It would take forever and require an enormous amount of stamina. Break it up into a split.  Full body warm up and prehab is probably a 20 minute endeavor. \n\nOther than straight arm stuff and rto rings, I find my hybrid workout fits pretty cleanly into a PPL situation with occasional additional rest days in the case of SA stuff - but I\u2019m old.",
            "You\u2019re targeting most of the major muscle groups but only training part of your core. If you choose to do ab-isolated exercises, throw in some oblique and lower back exercises as well. There are examples in the recommended routine.",
            "Stick to the big 5: pullups, pushups, squat, deadlift, run. If you can't do the exact workout find the closest replacement. That's all you need",
            "Consider breaking the total body workout into two day rotation; hits your goals of all muscle groups, with a quality day of rest and shortens your daily time working out. It even leaves time for cardio of walking or jogging. If weight lifting on day one exercises for chest, triceps, legs, abs walk or jog. Day two of rotation shoulder, neck, back, biceps, walk or jog. All can be completed in 45 min-1 hour.",
            "One leg squats, one leg half bridges, push up while planking core, pull up with L sit, standing leg raises (front, back, side), hanging leg raises and hanging twists, walk/run.",
            "Rowing ego is the most efficient way to get a full-ish body workout and cardio in the shortest time possible.",
            "Rapidly flail around with weights attached to all of your body (ideally with duct tape), and holding dumbbells",
            "> with some cardio on some of the rest days. \n\nTotal sidestepping the main question, I know, but is this recommended? I'm trying to find the ideal schedule for me, and I kind of can't stand the idea of rest days so this might be great for me..."
