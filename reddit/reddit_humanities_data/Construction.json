To prevent this from happening, I encourage people to verify as a professional.\n\nTo do this, take a photo of one of your jobsites  or construction related certifications with your reddit username visible somewhere in the photo. I am open to other suggestions as well; the only requirement is your reddit username in the photo and it has to be something construction-related that a homeowner typically wouldn't have. If its a certification card, please block out any personal identifying information. \n\nPlease upload to an image sharing site and send the link to us through \"Message the Mods.\" Let us know what trade you are so I know what to put in the flair. \n\nLet us know if you have any questions.",
