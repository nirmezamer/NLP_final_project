        "content": "Recently, a post here was removed for being a homeowner post when the person was in fact a tradesman. To prevent this from happening, I encourage people to verify as a professional.\n\nTo do this, take a photo of one of your jobsites  or construction related certifications with your reddit username visible somewhere in the photo. I am open to other suggestions as well; the only requirement is your reddit username in the photo and it has to be something construction-related that a homeowner typically wouldn't have. If its a certification card, please block out any personal identifying information. \n\nPlease upload to an image sharing site and send the link to us through \"Message the Mods.\" Let us know what trade you are so I know what to put in the flair. \n\nLet us know if you have any questions.",

R/ Construction.  65% diyers giving bad advice to 35% construction alcoholics unwinding and getting feisty at the end of the day.  Maybe you should have to take a pic of your beer to get the diy mods to know your a pro.\n\nCan we talk about monopoly framing now.",

It\u2019s entertaining to us and possibly helpful to them if they can sort legit advice out of the board stretcher replies. \n\nA couple years ago r/electronics cracked down on \u201cdumb questions\u201d and now there\u2019s a separate questions subreddit with a dickhead moderator who responds to every question with some snide-ass reply. One good subreddit became two of inferior quality. \n\nIf you really want to make a difference in the world create a collar tie knowledge test that must be passed before giving structural advice on stick framed roof systems.",

Recently, this page has digressed to construction-fails with zero context or blowing up real folks just asking for help. Did I miss a recent change in what this page is really for? It's now more like twitter/x type posts only looking for clicks or clout. Please enlighten me."
