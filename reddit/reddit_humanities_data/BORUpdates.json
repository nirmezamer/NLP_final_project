            "Im looking for the story about the girl whose father cheated on her mother, and forced her to do visitation with him and the AP. she told the step sister about the affair and then the AP attacked her. I think she started sing songs about cheaters around her dad to mess with him.",

Less rules around posting.\n\n* No 7 day rule\n* no strict template to follow\n* only necessary trigger warnings.\n* Posts still have to follow some basic rules, but we aim to make it a pleasant experience.\n\n3.   Less harassment of posters and other users in the comments.\n\n4. Aim to promote more engagement with our members where possible\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as another reminder, here is the first welcome post when the sub came into being during the [Reddit Blackout protests](https://www.theverge.com/23779477/reddit-protest-blackouts-crushed)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**First Welcome Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/14iq89p/welcome_to_the_new_boru/) **- 25th June 2023 Posted by** u/GuineaPigLover98\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to make a quick first post to welcome anyone who's upset about the death of old BORU and wants a new place to find redditor updates.\n\nI will make an official welcome post and rules this weekend.

May be a good idea if we slowly start by posting our fav updates to keep those alive*\n\n>OOP:That's a good question. I would say let's not start outright taking posts from BORU at this time, because as you said that could just result in retaliation.  \n>  \n>Instead, let's focus on getting new content in the sub. We have about 2 weeks worth of updates we can do since they were closed for almost 2 weeks.  \n>  \n>If you want to take your favorite updates that were already posted to BORU, I would make some effort to make the post your own. Don't just straight copy/paste the BORU post or x-post it.  \n>  \n>We'll have to figure out more formal rules around that in the coming days once the dust starts to settle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**naturemom**\n\n*Ooh, I hadn't thought of the possibility of a ban.

Lexi is such a sweet, hardworking, thoughtful, no-nonsense woman, and my son always remarks on how loved and respected he feels by her. I have never seen him happier. It warms my heart to see him so serious with someone after all these years. She is truly the daughter I have always dreamed of.\n\nI raised my son as a single mother for 29 years and had to be both mom and dad to him (his father walked out after his birth). Seeing him so deeply in love and respected by someone as amazing as Lexi fills me with pride and joy. I get to be girly with her and share my love of jewelry, which I plan to leave entirely to her. The entire family adores her and they are all excited to meet her. I already call her my daughter-in-law and consider her part of the family.\n\nLittle does she know that my son has already bought her a ring and plans to propose during her birthday vacation in September. I am so happy for them. I cannot wait to see their futures develop as spouses and, eventually, as parents when the time comes. My heart is overflowing with happiness and excitement for their journey ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Backwoodzdiva**\n\n \n*We are now all shipping them and cannot wait for updates!!! Pleaseeee try and find out the information of when she is doing it and tell him so he can make sure her ring is there too!!! She\u2019s putting in that work she should show off her bling bling from him to lol!!*\n\n\n>OOP:\nShe actually told me how she is proposing, it's also during the birthday vacation! She said she is creating a two chapter book with custom art of all their firsts in chapter one and the proposal and ring in chapter two. She is very creative!!\n\n\n\n**hinky-as-hell**\n\n \n*Are you kidding me?!! This is so adorable I am tearing up!\nAmazing!!!!! A race to the proposal, lol.\nPlease PLEASE update when they announce and tell us how it goes down?!*\n\n>OOP:\nShe is really really creative and thoughtful! My son said her first Xmas gift to him was a remastered (?) version of his favorite video game song... she hired a composer friend of hers to do it :)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 9 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy son, Sean, recently reached out to me with a request. He asked if I could take Lexi ring shopping with me since I\u2019m in the process of designing a new ring for myself. He thought it would be the perfect opportunity for Lexi to see different styles and find her ideal ring.\n\nSean shared with me that Lexi prefers something simple and not overly flashy. She told him, \"Anything bigger than 2 carats is for ego. I would just like a simple solitaire under 2 carats with no fancy band and a meaningful engraving.\" While Sean, being a successful environmental attorney, wanted to splurge on something beautiful and expensive for Lexi, her preferences are clear.\n\nA little back story: When they were dating and Sean was struggling to land a big law job, Lexi supported him without a complaint. She always told him, \"If I was in my residency and you had your big job, you\u2019d do the same. We just have to be patient, it will come, and one day we will laugh about it at our wedding.\" Lexi does enjoy expensive things, but she firmly believes that her fancy habits and tastes are hers to finance, never putting that burden on Sean.\n\nI'm taking Lexi to my jeweler this Friday, and I\u2019m incredibly excited to see her pick out her ring\n\nEDIT: Sean originally purchased a 3 stone ring that was 3.5 carats, when he spoke with Lexi and she said under 2, he needed my help. I bought that ring off of him, to add to my collection/to keep for them for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FeralCoffeeAddict**\n\n*You\u2019re the MIL everyone dreams of being able to have and spend time with one day*\n\n\n>OOP:\nI love her so much, she is the daughter I always wanted.\n\n\n\n**stinstin555**\n\nBeautiful! My fianc\u00e9 covered all of our expenses while I set up my consulting business. 20 years later I returned the favor when my hubby had a heart attack and needed a solid year to recover.\n\nWe celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary on May 30. Our vows were more than words we said to each other on May 30, 2003, they are the foundation that our marriage was built on.\n\nI wish the same for your son and future DIL. Life happens but as long as you have your partner\u2019s back you (as a team) can get through anything.\n\n>OOP:\nIt seems that they are on that path. She's been nothing but gracious and kind to my son.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n\n**I am not the OOP.

We haven't had any heated arguments or fights, except for the fact that she keeps tickling me randomly despite the fact that I've repeatedly told her to never do it again because I can act strangely to it (something from my childhood which I won't delve into).\n\nNow to get to the current situation: this week I've had my car returned from a paint job and some major look changes and I was really satisfied with the results, so I took a day off from work and took my girlfriend on a short trip outside the city. We drove to a lake, ate some food and relaxed for a couple of hours until it got pretty dark and we decided to head back home to get some sleep as I had to go to work the next day and she had an exam. On the way home, I started talking about how happy I felt with how the paint job turned out and out of nowhere, she starts tickling me. I pushed her hand away and told her to stop, then she reached for my ribs with both hands and got me swerving off the road.\n\nThankfully, nobody was hurt (although my car got some deep scratches but that doesn't even matter anymore), as I already slowed down after her first attempt to tickle me. I'll admit that I told her \"what the fuck is wrong with you\" as soon as we stepped out of the car and she started crying, but I couldn't care less as I felt as if my veins were about to pop. When we got home, I told her to pack her things and go to her best friend, but she threw a tantrum and begged me to forgive her for \"a little mistake\".\n\nI didn't say a word, I simply stared in disgust and pointed to her luggage. After her friend picked her up, I tried to go to sleep but my mind was racing, so i barely got any rest. This happened on Tuesday, and she's been blowing up my phone ever since, but I haven't answered any calls or texts and just blocked her. This led to her friend coming to my house and telling me to at least hear my girlfriend out, but I've told her to fuck off and leave me alone, which made her tell me that I'm more in love with a car than with my girlfriend.\n\nSo, AITAH in this situation? Should I talk to my girlfriend? I already feel like I can't trust her after what happened and that our relationship can't be fixed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**peakpenguins**\n\n*NTA, she's a fucking idiot. It wasn't just \"a little mistake\", you don't mess with someone while they're driving. Period. You've also told her time and time again not to tickle you and she refuses to respect that boundary, to the point of putting you and everyone on the road around you in danger. She can fuck right off IMO.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Content\\_Row\\_3716**\n\n*Who starts randomly tickling a driver?? This is insane.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PSSalamander**\n\n*I did this to my father when I was bored on a long road trip when I was about 5 years old. He pulled over and gave me a very stern lecture on how you NEVER mess with someone driving a vehicle, how dangerous it is, etc. I was super ashamed and learned a valuable lesson that day. This girl is 20 and doesn't get it? What a moron.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FinallydamnLDnat5**\n\n*I am a 42 F married. My kids are 11 and 9. I have taught them they can not argue and shout in the car to NOT DISTRACT THE DRIVER as all of our lives could be put at risk. The kicker for me was she did it a 2nd time after you told her to stop. OP you may have many girlfriends over the years, but you will only have one life. NTA my dude. Kick her ass to the curb.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**mattmawsh**\n\n*Pic of car tho?*\n\n>OOP: It's nothing crazy, a BMW E39, but it was my 18th birthday gift and I tried my best to keep it in good shape [https://ibb.co/3F8rWvC](https://ibb.co/3F8rWvC)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Judgement - NTA\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 1 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the past couple of hours have been insane, honestly. Before the actual update, I just wanted to sort some things out:\n\nI've seen people talking about this post being rage bait or fake. Honestly, I wish it was, but I actually needed to hear some opinions on what happened.\n\nSome people talked about me having anger issues: this is not true at all, I never snapped at her like this for tickling me (let along hitting her or anything like this), but in the rage of the moment, I couldn't keep my mouth shut. I might consider myself to be a calm person, but that doesn't mean I will laugh and giggle through stupid stuff.\n\nThe actual crash happened at a speed that could've killed us if I swerved in the wrong direction (I was driving on a country road, and could've frontally hit a car coming from the other direction, as the speed at which the crash happened was around 40mph/65kmph)\n\nThe tickling part and childhood trauma: I've mentioned that to my (now) ex-girlfriend around 3 months into our relationship, but as many pointed the obvious, I wasn't dating the sharpest tool in the shed and it took me a while to realize it, so I guess I might be a bit dumb as well lol.\n\nI think I might've misused the term \"Ghosting\". In my head, telling her to get out of my house was already a clear sign of our relationship status.\n\nNow, to the actual update:\n\nAfter reading nearly all the comments, I took the decision to send my ex a message where I told her we should meet face-to-face. Some people suggested that I should file for a lawsuit, but my ex is still in uni and her parents can barely afford helping her. She obviously has done an insanely dumb stunt, but I don't want to punish her parents for it. The car is in the process of getting fixed and I can afford it without major financial issues. Still, I took screenshots of her messages in order for me to have some proof in case the situation escalates.\n\nSo, we met earlier at a coffee shop. She looked as if she's been crying for a long time, but it didn't change my mind at all. What shocked me was the fact that she leaned in for a kiss when she saw me, as if nothing happened. I stopped her and told her that we need to have a serious conversation. I explained that what happened wasn't because of the car itself, but because of her disrespecting my boundaries and not thinking for a second about what might happen if she did that thing. Besides that, I also felt disrespected by the fact that her best friend came knocking at my door to demand things, despite not having any rights to do so, which led me to ask my ex if she told her best friend the truth or if she lied about the situation.\n\nShe said that she only told her friend that we had a small car crash and I'm pissed at her. Hearing that made me feel disappointed as hell, but I did my best to remain calm. I told her to tell the real story to her friends and family, and she raised her voice and told me that I'm accusing her of being a liar, something that led to a 15 minutes discussion about how the crash was solely her fault and how she put our lives at risk.\n\nI asked her if everything's clear to her about our situation and her response was \"Yep, 100%, can we go home now?\". That honestly shocked me. I told her that there's no way we can be back together and I suggested she should be more careful and considerate with her future partner. Her reaction was all tears, shaking, begging me to reconsider my decision, but I just can't look at her the same. I explained again that for me it wasn't a small mistake she made, it was a full-on stupid decision that shouldn't be done by an adult, as it could've resulted in something deadly.\n\nShe just thinks I'm exaggerating and this back and forth argument led to her asking if there's someone else in my life and I'm just using the accident as an excuse. I denied and told her that she's too selfish to even realise that she broke my trust and disrespects me by saying this crap.\n\nI left the coffee shop feeling like I've been talking to a wall, but at least I can't say that I didn't try to have a conversation. An hour ago her mom texted me asking what happened and I told her everything. I said that I don't want any money from them, but the only thing I'm asking is for my ex to keep her distance from me. She apologized for what her daughter did and wished me all the best. As for her friend, from my understanding she just came to my house without talking with my ex on whether she should do it or not, so I guess she just tried to be the main character in this whole story.\n\nRight now I'm preparing for work, but my chest isn't heavy anymore. In case anything will happen in the future, I'll keep everyone updated, but I hope it won't be the case lol.\n\nThank you for helping me navigate this weird situation and thanks for all the kind messages. Hope everyone stays safe!\n\nEdit: Sorry if this wasn't the drama-filled update some people might've expected, but I came here with the desire to get some perspective on my situation and be as transparent as possible, I never intended to post this story for votes or anything like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RocketteP**\n\n*Boundary issues aside (which is also a huge red flag), tickling someone while operating a vehicle imho is ridiculous and stupid. You\u2019re better off and I hope she continues to keep her distance. Make sure to change any passwords she may know of yours.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ZZartin**\n\n*Yeah the fact that it's still not clicking with her that she could have killed both them is a much bigger red flag.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**North-Reference7081**\n\n*you made the right call. sounds like nothing was really registering with her. it's one thing to make a mistake and be completely apologetic and learn from it, but from your description, I don't think she was gonna learn anything.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ZaraBaz**\n\n*I'm glad her mother and him had a chance to talk.

            "I'm just really hoping for OP to embrace that he also would have been 100% reasonable if he'd broken up with her after she continued to tickle him after he said no, before it ever got to the car incident. It's not OK to touch people in ways they have asked not to be touched.",
            ">An hour ago her mom texted me asking what happened and I told her everything.\n\nIs it just me, or the fact that his ex's mom asked him what exactly happened shows that the ex might have said the same thing she did to her friend, but her mom knew better by asking OOP? It seems to me, it's not the first time the ex did something outwordly stupid/dangerous.",
            "My mother used to think it was cute to pinch me (lightly, but still!) if I made a bad pun or joke, even if I was driving.  I kept telling her not to do that, explained why, yelled at her a few times nothing worked.  So one day we happened to be on a long, clear stretch of road with no traffic when she pulled that; I swerved all over the road like Id lost control.  She never did it again.\n\nShes not a bad mother, just occasionally thoughtless/short-sighted.  I dont usually have to be that drastic to get my point across, thankfully.",
            "Theres clearly something wrong with her because these arent the actions of a sane person. And I mean everything shes done e.g trying to go in for a kiss",
            "Ignoring OOP's boundaries is bad enough on its own. Distracting him while driving is whole other deal. This girl needs to grow up.",
            "My boyfriend used to like tickling my feet, especially when I was still asleep. I told him to stop and he would, but would forget and do it again a few months later. I'd usually end up flailing around, but would try to hold back to avoid hurting him.\n\nI turned the tables on him. I started tickling his feet when he was sleeping. He hated it. I also \"accidentally\" almost kicked him in the crotch with my flailing. Between the two, he stopped tickling. He realized how stupid and annoying it was. Plus he liked having uncrushed balls.",
            "So many people don't realize that there are a lot of people who have trauma over tickling, specifically. I'm one of them. It's one of my few HARD limits and boundaries. Tickling me will result in someone being punched and me having a severe panic attack. When I read this, I admired OP, because I would probably not have been able to control the car as well. \n\nTickling actually stimulates pain receptors. Tickling someone who doesn't want it is literally torturing them with pain.",
            "Play stupid games rofll!\n\nShe's frankly lucky! My brother is 6' 7\" 250 lbs, size 17 feet, and psychotically ticklish. I saw him kick some kid like 6 feet across the room as a reflex when he tried that on him. Not intentional, but also not something anyone can control.",
            "I can imagine this idiot ex, sobbing in a courtroom had things gone really bad, and wailing, \"It was just a harmless joke, your honor! I didn't realize we would take out a whole other family! It was an accident!\"\n\nFuck her. Fuck her idiot friends. I hope they all leave OOP alone.",
            "I always warn people: If you tickle me, I WILL become violent. So, if you tickle me and I hurt you, its your own damn fault."

Let's call him Tim. Tim and I have been together for two years. We talked about marriage, (we are both 26) and kids, etc, and till last week I thought I had the perfect love life. Now, Tim has his best friend Mimi (fake name). Tim also has a friend group he is very close to. The problem throughout our relationship was, that Tim would place me last whenever his friends were involved. He missed a promotion dinner for my work because Mimi's dog was throwing up. \n\nHe missed Diwali celebrations with my family because his friends wanted him to help paint their new house. Plus, some issues during his teenage years involving his friends, resulted in his dad threatening to take away his inheritance and distribute it to relatives. For context: His dad introduced us, and till last year, before I left the workplace which I joined straight after college, his dad was my boss. I still see him as a father figure and respect him a lot.\n\nNow, I have outright told Tim that I don't like public proposals. I am very introverted, and having eyes on me during a loving moment will only cause me anxiety. Tim said he understood and promised he wouldn't do one when he proposed. Another thing I told Tim was that Mimi treats me passive-aggressively because I'm kind of an anxious person, (I have mild OCD), and asked him to not involve her in our affairs. Tim said Mimi only wants the best for us. I kind of didn't press the issue after he got defensive.\n\nThursday, after I entered my flat, I was greeted by all of Tim's friends, with Tim in a suit, and a ring in hand. I kid you not, my flat was swarmed. There were people I didn't even know! Before Tim even said anything Mimi chimed in and said: \" Chill OP, dear god, this is not the time to make that face.\" I saw red. I was having a severe anxiety attack, as I don't do well with lots of people. I calmly told them that there would be no proposal and to get the hell out of my flat. \n\nThey looked like in shock, so I just left my flat with just my purse, called my best friend on the way and told her to get them out, and just called a car service and sat in the car, crying, for two hours and went to my cabin I brought. I texted my parents, so they wouldn't worry and told them to not take Tim's calls, switched off my phone, and stayed there. Luckily I had enough cash to make a grocery run, and the cabin was used last month. I only switched my phone on when I was calling a car and saw the barrage of calls and texts. I called Tim in the car, and he sounded defeated and kept on apologizing and crying. I told him it was over. Turns out my best friend told his dad, who was so mad, he told him that he would only get half his inheritance.\n\nI now feel that I reacted very badly and could have handled it with grace. I might have let my anxiety take over and overreacted and I cost Tim his money. AITA?\n\nEdit: My ex-bf and I are both Indians. One of the reasons why Tim's dad likes me is that I am from the same culture (though I am not comfortable with this reasoning). I am a lawyer and make enough money to buy and maintain a flat and a cabin. Tim only has access to my flat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The\\_Crown\\_And\\_Anchor**\n\n*So essentially, the proposal was what MIMI wanted*\n\n*Not what you wanted*\n\n*She knew you weren't going to like it which was why she made the statement that she did right when you walked in*\n\n*This was her goal the entire time.*\n\n*She wants your ex to herself*\n\n*So don't feel bad for your ex. He's a dumbass and he's stuck with Mimi now*\n\n*That being said*\n\n*CHANGE THE LOCKS ON YOUR APARTMENT And when you get home, make sure nothing is missing and nothing is damaged or broken. If it is, send the bill to your ex. Frankly, I'd have the entire place deep cleaned and send him the bill as well as the bill for the locksmith. Odds are his father would force him to pay for it*\n\n*Look...Mimi wants your ex. She was always going to ruin your relationship so just be glad it happened now before marriage and kids were involved*\n\n*NTAH*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WindowPixie**\n\n*I've often pondered in horror what I would do if my partner sprung this kind of proposal on me, and \"Immediately fleeing to my cabin that nobody else can come to\" is fuckin top tier.*\n\n*Tim deserves this.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**bluefleetwood**\n\n*He also deserves that asshole Mimi. They were made for each other. Absolutely 100% NTA.*\n\n*bored-panda55*\n\n*I hate public proposals/promposals/dateposals - they out the person being asked on the spot to feel like an ass if they say no.*\n\n*Literally told my kid don\u2019t ever do this unless you know 100% they will say yes and it is what they want.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Judgement - NTA\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 5 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people in both my previous posts said that it wasn't my fault, and after properly speaking to my family and friends, I realised that I was indeed, not that wrong. The bit about changing the locks, I'll get to that later, but my best- friend (who is staying with me for a few days), said that she checked and everything in my flat was in the right place, so I guess that's one problem less.\n\nPeople who keep sending me DM's saying it is fake because I own a cabin, I have no answer for that. Yes, I make enough money to live comfortably on my own and also have an extra place that I like to go to alone. And to some really funny gentlemen who have sent me more DM's on how I'd never find a husband if I didn't learn to keep my mouth shut, please eat shit. I don't have the mental space to argue with incels right now.\n\nFor the main update, I went and spoke to Tim's dad first. He was very mad at his son. He kept saying that Tim had finally crossed limits with that group and asked me to forgive his son. I respectfully told him that even if I got back with his son, my dad wouldn't approve. Which was true, and I said that, because I knew for Tim's dad, my dad's opinion mattered more. His dad then said that he was deeply sorry and that he would still support me if I needed help in the future. And I decided to take the things he left at my flat to him because I didn't want him over mine ever again.\n\nTim said he was very sorry, that he hadn't thought I was being genuine about my social anxiety (he has seen me get panic attacks in crowds ), and he thought that his friend's enthusiasm would be a positive thing. I asked him why none of my friends were there, and he said that because I have a very small number of friends, he thought we would have a nice dinner with them to share the news.\n\nNot gonna lie, his words hurt, because his friends deserved to be at the proposal but mine didn't because there were only five of them? Tim also mentioned that Mimi didn't like one of my friends because she was a single mom, and it just made me more mad. I told him that he would be better off marrying Mimi because it was quite clear everything in his life was about her. I told him that he was a shit partner and the reason why I wouldn't marry him and his dad is going to cut off his money is because he has let Mimi bully me throughout our relationship and it was Mimi's words that made me leave the proposal.\n\nTim looked very hurt and started apologizing. He also said that he never cheated on me, that he loved me, and he promised to do better. I told him I'd give him a chance if he cut off every one of his friends and moved with me to another city. He started crying at that and said he possibly couldn't live that way and asked me to reconsider. I told him I knew he would never choose me over his 'friends'. And I was feeling very petty, so I told him that Mimi would also never choose him over her successful boyfriend nor would any of his friends choose him over their own families. He told me he was very sorry, and that he would limit contact with them, but I told him there was no way I was going to be with him. I dropped his things, and I wanted to cry because he wouldn't even get up from the sofa or apologize or say that he wouldn't speak to Mimi again. He just turned his face away. I left.\n\nMimi later came by to my flat and asked if we could talk, so I let her in. My friend says it was a dumb move, but I was working and crying at the same time, so I wasn't thinking much. She said that Tim yelled at her for 'ruining his relationship', and she didn't know what she did wrong. I honestly, had zero energy for her, and just told her if she was done talking to please leave.\n\nMimi said that she just wanted to be there for Tim, and me making his dad cut him off was an awful thing to do. I then asked why she made a comment she knew would piss me off when I was being proposed to. Mimi replied that it was 'a joke' and I shouldn't have taken her seriously. I just asked her to leave, after that. She said she hoped I would be happy in the future, so I guess that was it. All of Tim's friend's numbers are blocked, including Mimi's. I blocked Tim and I'll get the locks changed next week.\n\nI wish I could write something positive here, but alas. Hopefully, there will be no more updates on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Labyris**\n\n*I think getting rid of the absolute jellyfish you were dating is a pretty positive thing to write. It sucks now, but you'll laugh with friends about the bullet you dodged once it's not as fresh.*\n\n*Wishing you luck!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weareallme**\n\n*I object to your insult to jellyfish, I'm sure they have a lot more spine than Tim.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Baddibutsaddi**\n\n*The funny thing is Mimi doesn't want Tim she just doesn't want him to put any woman before her, and Tim is just pathetic*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vegetable-Cod-2340**\n\n*This\u2026 she is the worst friend , keeping him like a \u2018emergency boyfriend\u2019, and everyone but him sees it.*\n\n*Tim\u2019s dad sees right through her , and even losing his inheritance won\u2019t keep him away.*\n\n*Sadly that relationship will end when Mimi decides and Tim will be left with nothing, the friends will probably go with her too.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**amw38961**\n\n*I didn't even think about that....all these friends are gonna be GONE once that inheritance is gone.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I am not the OOP.
