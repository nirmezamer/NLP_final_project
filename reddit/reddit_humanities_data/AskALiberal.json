I am acrually a vrry kind and empathetic person, and very progressive.",

Whether it's just coping ahead of time or strategizing where to go from here, at least we have four months to deal with it.\n\nI'll end this with what I have been repeating in damn near every response on the debate: Biden won't be the only name on your ballot, the president doesn't create legislation, and all the Democrats need to do is hold a single house of Congress to throw a wrench into a second Trump administration. Don't give up and get wins where you can.",

It was amazing seeing both of them do some version of, \"I can't vote for Donald Trump, but...\" after seeing Biden like that. For the first time in my life my parents are not reliable Dems on election day.",
            "I've seen people saying he'll do better in September, but my question is this: will we even get a 2nd debate? Why would Trump do it? He already won this one, so another debate would only give Biden a chance to make a comeback. Sure, another bad performance would finish Biden for sure, but why take the risk when you've already succeeded in solidifying the impression Biden can't hack it.\n\nWhat if we don't get another chance at this? Can Biden get enough coverage of him being confident and energetic without another big media event like a debate?",
            "Setting aside whether you personally think he\u2019s still got it: \n\nDo you think Biden has folks around him who would discourage him from continuing to seek the nomination *if* it became clear he wasn\u2019t up to the task?",

He has done a horrible job of building confidence in his accomplishments and the average citizen doesn\u2019t really feel the impact of his good economy.\n\nThen he comes out and absolutely fumbles a debate and his performance plays directly into everything his doubters and republicans are playing up.
