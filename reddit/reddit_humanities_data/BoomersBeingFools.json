        "content": "Today my husband, mom, and I went to my 12 week ultrasound appointment for our first child. I booked several weeks in advance and drank the 2 litres of water an hour before the appointment as required. \n\nMyself, and the majority of people in the waiting room absolutely had to pee while waiting for our appointment, but that's just the unfortunate reality of many abdominal ultrasounds.\n\nCue boomer lady who walked in with no appointment and demanded to be seen. The staff was kind, said they had an opening, but she must drink 2 litres and wait an hour before they could see her. She proceeds to drink two 500ml bottles and proudly tells the staff she's had her water. They reminded her now she has to wait.\n\nI was brought back for my appointment. It took about a half hour as I had to empty my bladder progressively throughout the appointment. Just as the tech was asking for my husband's and mom's name there's a knock at the door. The admin is asking how long we will be.\n\nApparently the entire time I was in the back the boomer was loudly complaining about how she could no longer hold her bladder and she must be seen now. She made a scene saying how ridiculous it was that she should be expected to wait.\n\nTo appease the boomer my tech asked me to leave the room so boomer could be brought in. My family and I had to wait for boomer before we could see the baby and hear the heartbeat.  \n\nThe tech didn't say anything regarding the health of our baby. Unfortunately in December my husband and I went to our first 12 week ultrasound only to learn we had lost the pregnancy. Needless to say my anxiety was very high waiting to get confirmation all was well.\n\nWe were only allowed in while boomer emptied her bladder. We did see the baby and hear the heartbeat but it was rushed as boomer returned shocked to see us in her room.\n\nShe scowled as we cheerfully left the room and waited for our picture. Why do they do this?\n\nUpdate:\nFor everyone assuming I'm in the US, I'm not. I'm in Ontario. I don't have to deal with insurance when taking ultrasounds. It was also done in a small town medical office that specifically handles ultrasounds and xrays, not the hospital.\n\nFor those saying it's fake because you can only do the ultrasound vaginally, nope. Both my last two 12-week scans and my 7-week scan were all done as a normal ultrasound requiring a full bladder.\n\nI'd love to say it didn't happen. The tech thought I was alone and was about to wrap up the ultrasound. She brought me back to the waiting room so that I could share the moment with my family. I'm not sure why the boomer couldn't have held it for another 5 mins, but it's not really my concern.\n\nI shared this as I thought it was funny, not devastating. I could imagine I'd feel very different if there was any cost to my care, but I'm fortunate not to need to worry about it. Our baby is healthy, which was the only thing we wanted. One day, this will be a funny story my husband and I will share with our child. Hope this clears some things up.\n\nUpdate 2: \nBoomer was not pregnant. People have abdominal ultrasounds for many reasons, not just babies. It was not an OB clinic. I didn't ask the boomer why she was there, it's none of my business.",

After his appointment, I decided to run into the store to try to find a few small additional gifts and party supplies for her birthday party. I was always very anxious about taking my daughter into stores as a baby because of germs and people trying to touch her, but I\u2019ve been trying to be less anxious with my son and was a little proud of myself for venturing out. I forgot to bring my baby wrap, so I was carrying him against my chest wrapped in a blanket with his head up close to my chin as I\u2019m still recovering from a c section and didn\u2019t want to carry his car seat.\n\nA boomer couple locked eyes on me and I immediately cringed because I knew they were going to approach me, although I assumed just to say how cute my son was. I tried to walk away and the man followed me and said \u201cHow do you like your baby?!\u201d I chuckled and said \u201cGood, I think I\u2019ll keep him\u201d Boomer then says very loudly \u201cThanks for choosing LIFE and not ABORTION!!\u201d After I picked my jaw up off the floor, I just simply said \u201coh, okay\u201d and again tried to walk away, but he kept following me reaching out to touch my son and saying random things about him. I just kept turning my body away every time he reached for him and then Boomer touched my hair and flipped it out of the way and tried to touch my sons face. I turned away so fast and finally made my escape, but not before he finally touched the back of his head and said something about \u201cWe sure do love these babies\u201d as I walked away.\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve found my voice and told him to stop touching us, but I was so uncomfortable and just wanted to get away from the situation. Boomer really missed his target crowd anyway as I\u2019ve struggled with infertility and both my children are very planned/wanted.
