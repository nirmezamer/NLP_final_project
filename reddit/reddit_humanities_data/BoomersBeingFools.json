The latter would seem to be covered by the \"elderly\" portion, but I've also seen a lot of comments that \"Boomer is more about attitude than actual generation\" and I'm inclined to agree, particularly when generation start/end dates are somewhat arbitrarily determined by the actual personality characteristics most commonly shared by members of the generation.\n\nSomething along the lines of \"boomers are anyone who looks like they may be in their late 50's or older\", or even just \"anyone exhibiting foolish behavior commonly associated with members of the Baby Boomer generation, regardless of their actual age\" might cut down on some of the sidebar arguments.",

Recently these visits usually involve grabbing something for my daughter (6 months) from one store or another since I am a stay-at-home mom. I unfortunately had a testosterone issue growing up resulting in me looking rather androgynous and very tall with a somewhat deep voice for a woman, this causes a lot of people to assume I'm a guy at first.\n\n\n\n\nWe were out grabbing nursery water and baby clothes for my daughter at a large box store when another boomer woman walked up to my mom, looked between my mom and I, looked at my daughter, and asked \"Is Daddy babysitting today?\" \n\nI normally ignore when people assume I'm a guy cause I am very used to it due to how I look, but this pissed me off. Apparently it pissed my mom off more because she handed my daughter back to me and started to take off her rings saying, \"My DAUGHTER is caring for my granddaughter, SHE does not babysit unlike your useless sack of shit husband.\"\n\nThat led to me holding my tiny mom back from kicking the shit out of another Boomer woman while trying not to laugh.

I had to beg her as she was walking out the door to please remember jesus instead of yelling at someone who has nothing to do with her problem.

The husband goes straight to the bathroom (it's for paying customers only) and the wife goes in line the wrong way to stand over my shoulder to see the flavors. Whatever. We are picking our flavors when she walks around us and does the same thing, leaning basically in front of my husband to look. They didn't get anything, but instead head back outside and sit in the shop's tables out front. It's a nice spot, but still, rude to not get anything.\n\nWe take up seats in a corner and are eating when I notice a large family is headed in. They're all ordering while the mom is trying to wrangle her youngest into a high chair. He is fussing and begins crying. I am fine with kids, but the shop is small, so we decided to head out. Kid is still crying as we are passing the Boomer couple (now chatting with other Boomers) and we overhear their conversation:\n\n\"Oh sounds like someone didn't get the flavor they wanted!\"\n\n\"That would never be me, if my kids had acted like that I would have beat their ass!\"\n\nMy husband loudly mocks them by parroting what they said back to them with a \"ha-ha-ha isn't child abuse FUNNY?\"\n\nEdit: reading through comments and I'm so sorry to all of you who have experienced abuse as children under the guise of \"discipline.\" My older gen x mother also hit me with a flyswatter, but my friend was hit repeatedly with a belt then forced to do push ups.

        "content": "I'm a really easygoing guy who, for the most part, rolls with the punches, but this absolutely pissed me off.\n\nI recently moved to a much larger city and have been researching new dentists, specifically those who understand \"trauma-informed care.\" I have extreme anxiety about visiting the dentist due to a traumatic experience from my childhood. When I was 11 years old (now 37), I went to a dental appointment with my grandmother. While waiting for her in the waiting room, I suddenly heard her scream from another room. When I went to check, I saw blood everywhere\u2014on her face and clothes, on the floor, and on the dentist. The dentist had accidentally cut her tongue so badly that she eventually won a lawsuit for damages. This incident left me with a lasting fear of dentists.\n\nAfter some research, I found a dental office with a knowledgeable and caring approach to trauma. I emailed back and forth with the doctor and staff, shared my concerns, and booked an appointment. On the day of the appointment, I was treated very well when I walked in. The staff made a conscious effort to make me comfortable without being patronizing. After chitchatting with the front desk ladies, I sat next to an older woman in the waiting area.\n\nAs soon as I sat down, she turned to me and asked, \"Why are you getting the VIP treatment?\" I shrugged and said it was my first time there, and they were just being welcoming. She then complained that the place was never friendly to her despite her spending \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" there, which seemed unlikely given the office had only been open for about eight months. Noticing my nervousness, she asked why I was anxious. I briefly explained my grandma's incident, and she lost it.\n\nShe accused me of exaggerating the event, claiming kids are not good at perception, and suggested I was using this fear to justify being lazy about my oral care. She said, \"Kids these days are always looking to blame their past and not take accountability,\" and mentioned her own kids barely speak to her anymore. The final straw was when she told me that \"my generation\" needs to toughen up and understand that such events shape our character.\n\nI finally interrupted her, saying, \"I have a PhD in Psychology, and the trauma from that incident actually made me interested in studying trauma and its impact on youth as they grow up. So yes, it did shape me.\" She retorted that I should have learned how to get over it if I had so much education in the field. I responded, \"Maybe you should get educated before you speak about something you know nothing about and keep your nose out of people's business.\"\n\nShe then got up and complained about me to the front desk, but the staff defended me, saying, \"We saw you instigating the poor boy. Take a seat and stay quiet.\"\n\nI appreciated the support from the front desk ladies. It's unfortunate that this woman felt the need to invalidate my fears and continue the conversation, but it was reassuring to feel supported by the staff.\n\nEdit: spelling.",
