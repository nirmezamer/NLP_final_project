            "I always give way to buses.\n\nHowever, when you pull into a bus stop, I'd appreciate it if you would tuck your bum in to allow those in the left-hand lane to pass you.\n\nMost people will let you out, you don't need to block them."

It gives you the option to enter your NMI (national meter identifier) - do this because then it will work it out based on your actual consumption over the last 12 months.\n\nBe aware that lots of places are having a price rise on 1st July and the [energymadeeasy.gov.au](http://energymadeeasy.gov.au) site will show you the current price until the price rise hits. You might be better off waiting till 1st July to do the comparison. \n\nAnother tip - if you tell the new provider that you're \"moving in\" they will organise a special meter read and transfer you over immediately. If you just want to change providers it waits till the next billing cycle. The special meter read costs - $15 or so I think - so you'd have to work out if it was worthwhile based on the number of days to the next cycle. Given the size of your bill it would probably be worthwhile."
