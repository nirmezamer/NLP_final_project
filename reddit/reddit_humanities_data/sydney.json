When he told me the circumstances a while ago I pointed out that they were doing something very dodgy and probably desperate to do it by the 30^th of June as well. He brought up my barrack-room-lawyer objections with them and guess what, they're paying him a whole extra months salary just to keep his mouth shut.",

This is how all those years of dragging ourselves out of bed at 6:30 AM in the cold and the rain have paid off.\n\nNot just a connection to someone but that someone is also a Parkrun person who will appreciate the dedication (and volunteering) because they've done it themselves.",

It feels like sometimes they\u2019re trying to run orange lights and then end up needing to brake hard.\n\nHonestly feel car/ motion sickness a lot when taking buses cause of this. \n\nHas this generally been your experience ?",

            "Bus will blow up if they dont maintain 50mph",
            "Its been like this since the dawn of time. Its because theyre running late due to Sydney traffic, so they try to make up time. I actually feel bad for them. People are unhappy if the bus is late, but its not the bus drivers fault that theres bad traffic.",
            "I cant speak for all drivers but I have to drive a bit harshly sometimes to meet the ridiculously tight timetables, especially at night. If you take a look at TripView timetables youll understand. Otherwise Id always drive as smoothly as I can as I regularly take buses too and understand the passengers pain. Also our breaks between each trip are only a few minutes so if we run a few minutes late then we wont have little to no break. I feel bad for all the new drivers as theyre constantly running late and not having their breaks between trips to make up time.",
            "Most of them, yes. Occasionally you get a good one who drives normally. \n\nI'm not sure if their KPI includes on time running. If so it might explain the erratic driving.",
            "Privatised, trying to put on as many services so they look like they are doing a good job. I'd say having very tight runnings for the drivers to get extra runs. Also conditions went to shit so most of the experienced drivers left, now they will hire anyone. Drivers in my area don't even have uniforms most the time",

            "You dont need a PhD or alot of experience to drive a bus coupled with extreme demand for drivers tends to lower the standard alot. Worth noting that they have a timetable to adhere too as well so the whole conservation of momentum thing for heavy vehicles goes out the window as well.",
            "I get motion sickness as it is and couldnt agree more with you. The number of times Ive nearly vomited from the erratic driving from the bus driver. They also dont realise people who are standing go flying from the hard brakes and acceleration!"
