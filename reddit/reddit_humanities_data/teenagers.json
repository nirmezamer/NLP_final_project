He\u2019s sweet, he\u2019s met my parents and they like him too. Today I saw him again and we were home alone, so we decided to fool around a little.\n\nI don\u2019t masturbate often and when I do it\u2019s never fingering, only outside stuff cause I\u2019ve never enjoyed penetration, even with just one finger. Anyways so it happened, and he had a condom, and oml it hurt like a bitch. Like it felt horrid at first, then turned tolerable but no where near as good as masturbation, and he kept apologising and asking if I was okay and I just kept saying I was fine and just needed to adjust. Anyways things got worse cause he pulled out and there was blood and I genuinely felt so bad and I\u2019m so scared he might be disgusted with me or smth or be worried that I hate him. Neither of us finished cause my dad came home and everything seemed fine after that but still. It was also so awkward when I offered to just stop and tell him this wasn\u2019t working, and he respected my decision but he looked a little disappointed. Losing my virginity wasn\u2019t enjoyable at all really, and I\u2019m scared to have sex again if he tries to bring it up, I don\u2019t want it to hurt like a bitch again.",
