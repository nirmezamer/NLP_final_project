            "This is how high school dating has always been. Talk to some old people, and they'll tell you. My grandma tells me sometimes about her high school experiences and it's basically the same thing as you say.\n\n  \nYou just have to get older, and people will mature and be more prepared for a serious relationship. As a teen, most of us don't really know who we are yet, and we definitely don't know what kind of things we want in a person, what kinds of things we need out of a relationship, what things to avoid in a relationship, how to communicate well, etc. So as you get older and figure that stuff out more, and your peers do the same, relationships will change from the more superficial current ones to longer-lasting, deeper relationships",

The only real difference is that contraception wasn\u2019t as common so those forays usually led to shotgun marriages and commitments lol.",
