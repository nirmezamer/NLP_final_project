        "content": " It's an election year (in the US)! You know what that means - another year of Giant Douche vs Turd Sandwich! \n\n# OUR RULES ON POLITICS\n\n# IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS POST YOU RUN THE RISK OF GETTING PERMANENTLY BANNED.\n\n**All political discussion must pertain to the world of South Park.**\n\nAgain: **All political discussion must pertain to the world of South Park.**\n\nOnce more for those in the back: **All political discussion must pertain to the world of South Park.**\n\nThis means real world politics are only to be discussed within the context of the show. If someone does not appear in the show, well they don't really belong on this sub. **Donald Trump does not appear on the show as President Trump - that is President Garrison.** \n\nDo you love and support the left? We don't care. Do you love and support the right? We don't care. Are you a Libertarian? We don't care. We are unpaid mods here to enjoy a tv show, not push agendas, get into political slapfights, or deal with a bunch of political shit. If you want to have a political discussion, go to [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) or any of the numerous other political subs. We are a sub about the television South Park. We are not a sub about politics. \n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Why don't you allow real world politics?**\n\n>We decided that real world politics just aren't worth the shit show they bring. When someone mentions Biden or Trump, or one of the numerous wars going on, a lot of people from outside the subreddit come in to argue political points and push agendas. We are not here to moderate that type of discussion, and if you as a user want that discussion, you can find it basically anywhere else on reddit.\n\n**Why don't you change the rules?**\n\n>We are a subreddit about a TV show, and as such it wouldn't make sense for us to be a political subreddit. We know Southpark often times connects, mimics or otherwise makes note of current events and we'd love you to discuss that - just keep it within the context of the show.\n\n**But President Garrison is supposed to be Trump!**\n\n>That isn't a question, but we all know who he is supposed to be. You want to make some stupid meme? Use President Garrison, just leave Trump & his name out of it. (Seriously, even putting his name in a title brings out the politics.) You can use [the actual Donald Trump from the show.](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Trump) He isn't president in the show, so it won't exactly make sense, but you do you. Southpark has not made mention of President Biden, nor is there a character who was \"transformed\" into him, so you'll have to leave him out.   \n>  \n>Simply put, **DO NOT USE REAL WORLD DEPICTIONS.**  \n>  \n>I am not kidding here, the mere mention or real world depiction of political figures brings out more idiots than just using their in show counterparts. People get passionate about politics, and while that is good, it is also really annoying.\n\n**I got banned for politics, what do I do?**\n\n>First off you should read this post. A link to this post may be included in your ban message. Once you have read this post, respond to the message and tell us you have read this post and are sorry for breaking the rules. So long as you aren't a dick about it, you will get unbanned. **Seriously, an apology will get you so far.**\n\n**I am trying to write a fan script about Southpark. Am I allowed to use political things that haven't appeared in the show?**\n\n>Simply put: no. We will still remove the post, because all this is going to do is fuel the fire and draw more political comments.\n\n**I have additional questions! What do I do?**\n\n>Send us a ModMail and we may add it to the Q&A!\n\nAnd don't forget: **All political discussion must pertain to the world of South Park.**\n\n\\~The [r/southpark](https://www.reddit.com/r/southpark/) mod team",

        "content": "Hello, r/southpark go fuck yourself\n\nTLDR: We updated our rules on videos to allow videos during the off-season and added a rule prohibiting self promotion. Piracy remains prohibited. I'd suggest reading the Q&A below.\n\nFor a very long time, many of you have asked us to revisit and reevaluate our rule that prohibits videos. It's the single largest reason posts are removed, and we're often asked if we will reconsider the rule. To be honest with you, the rule existed before I became a moderator, and prior to now, I was never in a position to reevaluate the rule. As a result of your feedback, we will now allow videos to be posted to the subreddit during the shows off season with a few catches.\n\nFirst and foremost, piracy remains prohibited (inline with Reddits TOS), and posting links to watch full episodes will still land you in Reddit jail.\n\nSecondly, we are prohibiting self-promotion of your own channels. Have a huge YouTube follow? We don't care. Have a small YouTube following? Guess what, we still don't care.\n\nThirdly, we will prohibit videos the week a special airs (14-days from airdate) to help control spoilers.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the subreddit and videos can still be removed for violating any of our other rules, however we feel our reassessment will be a happy medium between allowing videos and controlling spam. See below for our Q&A, and if you read this far, we're looking for more moderators so go ahead and send us a ModMail if you want to apply!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Q&A**\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Q: What's the new rule on videos?**\n\nA: Videos are allowed during the shows off-season. To control spoilers, videos will be disabled for the week of the premier of any special.\n\n**Q: I have a YouTube/Twitch Channel! Can I promote it?**\n\nA: No, we do not allow self-promotion of any kind\n\n**Q: Woah I found this channel that streams South Park episodes for free 24/7! Can I post it?**\n\nA: No, piracy remains a violation of our rules, and we continue to have a zero-tolerance policy.\n\n**Q: When does this rule change take effect?**\n\nA: It starts right now! All rules prohibiting videos should be removed, so go for it!\n\n**Q: When will we stop allowing videos to be posted?**\n\nA: The day of the first episode premier of any season, videos will be turned off, and won't be turned on until 1 week after the airing of the last episode of the season. Additionally, starting on the airdate of a special, videos will be turned off for 7-days.\n\n**Q: Hey! My video was removed but you said you allow videos now, what gives?!**\n\nA: We will continue to remove low-effort shit posts, so your video was probably a low-effort shit-post.\n\n**Q: I created a fan-made episode/fan-made content, can I post it?**\n\nA: Yes, however we retain the right to remove any fan-made content. When we're talking about fan-made content we're talking about basically the fan-art of videos, so content that isn't about or does not use existing South Park clips, discussions etc.\n\n**Q: I have more questions, what should I do?**\n\nA: You should send us a Mod Mail. This Q&A will continue to be updated if we get additional questions from the subreddit.",
