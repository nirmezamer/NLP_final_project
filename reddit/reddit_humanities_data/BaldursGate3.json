There's also some recommendations in there for learning about lore.\n\nI\u2019d recommend also checking the **New Player Question** or **Question** **flairs** to see if your question has been asked before. You can also type into whatever search engine you use:\n\n**\\[insert your question here\\] baldursgate3 reddit**\n\nOr\n\n**\\[insert your question here\\] bg3 reddit**\n\nThat\u2019ll help us prevent the subreddit from being cluttered with the same repeated questions.\n\nIf your question hasn't been asked (or asked recently enough) then use either one of the question flairs above and ask away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BG3Builds and Multiclassing**\n\nFor the people curious about builds or who want a more dedicated place to discuss them, there's r/BG3Builds.

            "Just wanted to share my excitement with the world that I completed the game on tactician! I am someone who plays video games in explorer or easy mode, because I am just that bad at games. I can't believe I actually did it, and I'm so pumped about it!! The extra challenge was honestly really fun!",
            "I don't really need help but didn't want to make a separate post for this... finally finished my Honour Mode run at got the 54/54 achievements.",
            "I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for all the info and being so welcoming for a complete rookie. Loving this game and can\u2019t wait to play again and again with different classes & choices.",
            "Pickpocketing - people always talk about how they pickpocket NPC's all the time.  I almost never do it because I worry about getting caught and causing a big fight.  Do people pickpocket one item at a time?  Doesn't the person turn around immediately to catch you?  Maybe I've had bad luck the few times I've tried so I've stopped trying.",
            "I feel so unburdened, just beat honour mode and was such a journey. Amazing game!",
            "Finished Act 2 and I just found out that inspiration rerolls are capped at 4. I should have been using them much more than I have, instead of hoarding them lmao.",
            "I keep getting incredibly annoying \"someone is editing a character- unconfirmed changes will not be saved messages.\" Im in single player. No one is editing a character. I have no idea what's causing this and it seems to be happening more and more, any fixes?",
            "So I'm in act 3 and fighting some wizard with aylin But she seems to just stand there and do nothing but I can't interact with her either is there some mechanic I'm missing or it a bug?",
            "My wife and I have been playing our campaign for like 6 months and we just made it to Baldurs Gate. Suddenly when she talks to people 90% of the time it freezes and we have to reload the game. She can't get out of the conversation and just nothing happens (same thing happens with the magic mirror in camp). Help!",

You then see a bunch of those Githyanki zombies who have as she puts it \u201cascended\u201d. It was very scary to see because Lae\u2019zel was been brought up to believe that this is the highest achievement her people can reach. Seeing her grin fade them come back kinda gives me the idea that right before her death she realizes that ascension was indeed a lie but its to late to turn back. Man it\u2019s sad",

            "Definitely on my \"things I can't bring myself to do\" list. Literally a fate worse than death for such a great character like Lae'zel.",
            "imo this is probably the worst ending for any companion. its certainly the most unsettling. even on an evil run i refuse to let lae'zels soul get consumed by some wannabe bitch god.",
            "Withers said she might have fought back and I choose to believe that because I wanted to try every character\u2019s evil ending and hers was the worst \ud83d\ude22",
            "I feel like after you kill Voss Lae'zel stays in a perpetual state of denial (at least at first). She immediately says something like what's done is done but I don't really believe her.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the Vlaakith path tbh. I feel like Larian doesn't even try to convince you that siding with Vlaakith is a good idea.",
            "Even worse is you can also clown yourself if you're Gith Tav, and go with her to Ascend.",
            "Wait is ascension really a scam??? I never got this ending before.",
            "I was able to ride off on a dragon with Bae'zel. After reading this, I'm even more satisfied that Orpheus gave his life for us to be and fight together.",
            "I think it's awesome that they have obviously bad endings for origins.  Still an ending I want to get after I finish my 8th dark urge sorcerer that fully embraces the urge. Maybe.",
            "But did you speak with Withers afterward? He says that someone like laezel may be just the kind of person to ultimately manage to avoid that fate.\n\nSo, maybe a little hope there.",
            "Ohhmygodh. I accidentally backstabbed Laezel at the very end and killed her at the docks. Guess that was a better fate than Vlaakith."
