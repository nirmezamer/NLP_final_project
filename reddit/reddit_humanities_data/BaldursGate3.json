I am someone who plays video games in explorer or easy mode, because I am just that bad at games. I can't believe I actually did it, and I'm so pumped about it!! The extra challenge was honestly really fun!",
            "I competed act 1 almost 100%, I skipped the githyanki crest. \n\nI then went and completed a bunch of act 2, and realized there was some merit in going back to compete that quest. \n\nNow having completed it, I can no longer walk freely out of moonrise tower\u2019s moonshield without being forced into turn based mode by the darkness\u2026. Did I break by run?\n\nNO. I FIGURED IT OUT!!!\nIf you leave act 2 and head back to act 1, you lose the Pixie blessing (assuming you have it)\n\nInteract with the bell once returned to act 2 and you will have a brief interaction with the pixie. \n\nThis gives the blessing back",

            "Pickpocketing - people always talk about how they pickpocket NPC's all the time.  I almost never do it because I worry about getting caught and causing a big fight.  Do people pickpocket one item at a time?  Doesn't the person turn around immediately to catch you?  Maybe I've had bad luck the few times I've tried so I've stopped trying.",
            "I feel so unburdened, just beat honour mode and was such a journey. Amazing game!",
            "I BEAT HONOR MODE I can't believe it!! I'm so proud of myself omg. I made a post in BG3 builds sub if anyone wants to read the long story. I'm on cloud nine right now!! And now going to take a much much needed break from this game after like 800 hours lol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you thank you thank you to everyone on this sub who has answered my dozens of questions day in and day out!!",
            "So all my runs are fully switched over to Tactician difficulty, and my first character to beat the game was a Tactician run start to finish. I greatly enjoy challenging gameplay and will probably try out Honour Mode for my final playthrough. \n\nI\u2019m sort\u2019ve reflecting on where I\u2019d like to go from here with the game and what builds I\u2019d like to try, and I feel like I keep thinking that the most effective strategy in nearly every encounter is just \u201calways just do damage.\u201d\n\nI mean sounds kind of obvious, but what I mean is whenever I play a Paladin there\u2019s almost never a turn I bother using any other ability or spell other than a smite. Even on my Oathbreaker I hardly see a reason to use the Oath charges, even the AoE fear is usually resisted enough that a more economical use of my action would\u2019ve just been to swing my sword and put a Smite on it. When all of these other actions may easily fail and aren\u2019t always even that effective, why take the risk when you can have relatively guaranteed big damage? This applies in more ways than just a Paladin which is just an obvious example. \n\nMy Draconic Bloodline Sorc who I built to make use of Careful meta magic control spells basically just uses the frost Cantrip into a second because the Necklace of Elemental Aug is so centralizing and powerful. Added a Mourning Frost and I basically just blast Cantrips all day, like an icy Lock (speaking of Cantrips). \n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is that I feel like the best use of action economy is almost always just going for what\u2019s going to do reliable single target damage, and in some cases AoE. Maybe this is more noticeable on Tactician where you get punished harder if you\u2019re not taking mobs out quickly, paradoxically maybe I\u2019d find this less of an issue on an easier difficulty where I can more or less start doing other things than all out assaulting on every turn. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever bothered with any Charm spells, slow, fear, polymorph, half or more of the difficulty terrain spells just aren\u2019t necessary and inconvenience you just as much (Evards, good IMO only in very limited circumstances). When I do want a control spell, either Hold Person or Banish (with the occasional niche usage for Command) just seems so much consistently better than anything else. I just feel like I keep going back to \u201cblast blast blast\u201d on every turn because it nearly always feels like  anything else in most cases is potentially wasting an action, and I think it\u2019s making the gameplay feel smaller than it is. \n\nAbsolute masterpiece of a game and this is at best a nitpick from someone with over 500 hours. Most games can be brute forced like this anyway, I just wish I felt more of an incentive with Action usage to do things other than hit as hard as possible on every turn.",
            "Between multiple posts calling Lae'zel green and Orpheus the Frog Prince, I have just one question:\n\n. . . Am I fucking colorblind?\n\nThey both look yellow-orange to me.",
            "So I'm still not very good at this game, and wondering what are some ways to improve my build/party. Currently still in Act 1, right now at >!the goblin camp!<. What are good ways to manage my party so we don't get curbstomped by everyone and their mother? I'm on tactician mode.\n\n[Link to party composition](https://imgur.com/a/Jg0Ri0B)"

        "content": "Discovered the game about a month ago, been playing it an absolute ton since. Completely fell in love with the world on my first play through and decided to give resist durge a run after hearing how fun that can be. Love the idea of a character struggling to control their awful urges. The dichotomy of desires and reason/compassion conflicting was such a compelling narrative. Really enjoyed it. Genuinely was crying at the redemption scene.\n\nWas outside having a cigarette really not an exaggeration to say this game has dominated my thoughts these past few weeks.  \"I know It's only a game and I'm playing the role, but if this was real life, would I be able to stop myself if my impulses were screaming to murder someone?\". Then I said to myself \"Of course you couldn't you have heart palpation and are taking beta blockers, yet you're standing here doing something that's going to kill you and you can't stop yourself, I'm not a master of my emotions. I'm a slave to this shit just as much as murder Durge is a slave to his desire to murder\". The thought really floored me. I actually stopped what I was doing and felt repulsed at myself for smoking in a way I hadn't felt in a long time. Ashamed how long I've let this go on and get worse, all because my desires told me to do something and I wasn't strong enough to pass the IRL will check to just fucking stop it, even if it meant I could die. Of course I wouldn't be able to stop if I was Durge. I don't know the last time I felt so weak and pathetic.\n\nThrew out all my cigarettes, got nicotine patches which I'm currently using. I haven't gone a cigarette/nicotine pouchless day in nearly two years before this. I'll have a nicotine free day soon. I'm going to beat this shit this time. You find inspiration and clarity in the strangest ways. Maybe this game will have a real impact on my life and give me a few years if I can summon the resolve to make this stick. It's not going to be easy, but I guess that's the point.\n\nDon't expect anyone to care, just felt nice putting these thoughts to text.\n\nEdit: I wish I could respond to everyone being so kind to me, it really moves me. Thank you, you all made a hard thing a bit easier. I've read every comment.",
