        "content": "Happy New Year [r/IRLgirls](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRLgirls) members!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have made some VERY important rule additions and updates, so please review them after reading this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this time last year, we had around 475k members and this year we now have over 610k members! So welcome to all the new members and thanks for building a large community to everyone who has been around for a while!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a new year, a new banner has been released for 2023. The banner contains photos of the ten most upvoted posts in 2022 that were in the portrait format and were clear in quality. Users who submitted these photos received a distinguished flair for being a top post contributor in 2022. In addition to that, our new avatar is the top voted Original Content creator in 2022,\u00a0[u/looseends23](https://www.reddit.com/user/looseends23). I would like to congratulate and thank Quinn for her contributions to the subreddit! We will do the same thing next year for those who are looking to accomplish these achievements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post will explain a few changes and provide guidance with participation in the subreddit. We hope to reduce the amount of modmail that we have to go through on our end so we can have a better response rate and time for questions and concerns moving forward. As always, make sure you read and understand the rules of the subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAPPEALING A RULING\n\nIf you would like to appeal, please keep your post and/or comment up. We cannot review posts and comments you delete, and your ban will stay in place if we cannot review it. We created a very strict Automoderator for this subreddit, so it may produce a false positive violation. If this happens, just let us know or ask for clarification why something was flagged and we will gladly give an explanation. Seeing \"temporary banned\" or \"permanently banned\" is probably frustrating to you, but WE WILL work with you, just be polite and calm as we will most likely ask for a request to clear things up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThe moderators have noticed that the comments in the subreddit are leading to NSFW (direct or implied sexual) conversations, asking for identifying information, and other content that is not meant for this subreddit. At this point, we do not feel that comments are adding any value. Around April 30th, if we do not see things cleaned up, we will disable comments on all posts and keep them disabled until further notice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nREPORTING POSTS/COMMENTS\n\nPlease message the moderators through modmail and include a link to the post and why it breaks the rules. Using the reddit report system is not that effective as it just flags a post and we have to guess what is wrong with it. Also, we could miss something, so community help would be great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is everything that I can think of at the moment that we went over as a mod team, and thank you for reading this! As always, feel free to comment on anything below including any questions or concerns you may have.",
