Looking to keep rent below $1,100. I don't need anything fancy, just a studio or 1 bed in a decent area. I would appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!",

I\u2019ve been told that a lot of people are private renters in Grandview who don\u2019t necessarily post their listing so I\u2019ve done some driving around to no avail\n\nAny help or thoughts is appreciated!!",

The fries are good, too.  They make their own ketchup, which is better than most \"bespoke\" ketchups.\n\nThe interior decor is very simple, but with posters from Horror films and a portrait of Robert Smith and his wife looking down from a place of honor, it's cute.",
