I couldn\u2019t go in the kennel area, I had to ask them to bring out a specific dog I wanted to see, fine, so they bring her out. First of all, she\u2019s covered in her pee and poop. They tell me they think she had a UTI. \u2026.ok. Then they didn\u2019t allow the dog to be put on the floor in the lobby because \u201cthe floor has so many germs.\u201d So the shelter worker is awkwardly holding her in the lobby in the blanket like \u201chere she is. What do you think?\u201d I asked them to bathe her. So they bathe her and bring her out again, we go outside, I\u2019m told I\u2019m not allowed to take the dog in the grass. The dog tried to just hid and curl up under the bench and won\u2019t move, shaking and she looks SO scared. I think to myself, \u2026 I need to get her out of here. So I pay and adopt her, and I driver her back, realize she has fleas. I drive an hour again the next day to the vet the shelter works with to get the UTI they mentioned taken care of. Vet tells me she has an upper respiratory infection and has a fever. I was so sad and mad, and glad I was able to adopt her. Has anyone had a similar experience with any shelters in the surrounding area?! Is this normal for rural shelters?! It wasn\u2019t like this when I volunteered at shelters in town here.

            "I saw a post from another organization saying right now shelters all around central Ohio are way maxed out and struggling. It could be that they just got the dogs in and hadn\u2019t had a chance to do their normal process yet or something like that?",
            "Re: no grass or lobby floor - yes this is standard and should be standard with all puppies. Parvo is deadly to puppies and recent strains have been deadly to adult vaccinated dogs as well. Unlike most viruses parvo can survive on inanimate objects for months if not years if the conditions are correct & bleach is pretty much the only disinfectant that kills it. They don\u2019t know if a dog came to the shelter through the lobby or walked by with parvo. It\u2019s why many vets recommend not taking your puppy to pet stores or letting them out of your own yard until they have full immunity. \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be letting puppies sit around in pee & poop for long periods of time but without knowing what\u2019s going on behind the scenes it\u2019s hard to know how neglectful they may be. Puppies being house with other puppies are hard to keep clean. particularly if you can\u2019t take them outside bc of parvo. They spend a lot of time playing & don\u2019t particularly care if they are wrestling one another through pee/poop/the water bowl/whatever. \n\nFleas are always unacceptable. \n\nAn upper respiratory infection in a rescue puppy or kitten isn\u2019t surprising, they get sick a lot just like kids do & being in rescue is essentially the same as being in daycare & exposed to everyone\u2019s illnesses. If one littermate gets something they usually pass it around for a while. That said the shelter not knowing or already having the puppy in treatment is more concerning. \n\nAs always, the best thing you can do for a dog in rescue is to get it into a home. Shelters & fosters are meant the be a stopgap & the very unfortunate reality is it\u2019s nearly impossible for a dog to have the quality of life it deserves in that situation. I\u2019m sure Mochi is glad to be home.",
            "What in the hell is going on, from the perspective of workers in the shelter system in Ohio:\n\n-Funding cuts. What can you do? Please vote down ballot for people who don\u2019t belong to the party that shoots their own pets for giggles. They also shoot our budgets.\n\n-Lack of donations. What can you do? Set up a recurring donation (it can be $15/mo, whatever) to a shelter you DO like. It builds their capacity, lessening the dogs that get sent downstream to less reputable shelters. Can\u2019t donate? Volunteer. Spread the word. It all helps build the overall infrastructure of animal care. We are a network, a community, not a silo.\n\n-Low wages leading to high staff turn over/unqualified replacements. What can you do? 1) Vote for people down ballot who will ensure livable wages are paid to the people caring for unhoused animals, so they can continually show up and do their best work 2) Volunteer at a shelter you like. Take on un-fun tasks like poop, cleaning, laundry so vet and animal care staff can actually tend to the animals. Many of these professionals are cleaning all day due to minimal staffing\n\n-Lack of supplies. What you can do: Rural shelters may not have a development team to get community donations, or strategic, forward-thinking Board members. Is their Board volunteer based? Would you have value to add, if so? Do you know anyone who would? Do you have connections to local businesses that may want to donate a new washer dryer, cleaning supplies, a security system? Anything helps. Non profits are still businesses. \n\nThanks for adopting and seeking medical care for your baby. \ud83d\udc9c",
