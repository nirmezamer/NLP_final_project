Also when they do this, the flies will just attack the restaurant and you will have the opportunity to eat noodles with flies running into your mouth. \n\nWho else hates sweet food?",

If you look at it and expect a certain savoury taste and they added too much (or any) sugar, it's automatically disgusting. Even if it's actually not that bad... If you thought it was going to be savoury it's a huge red flag. \n\nI'm sure there's an evolutionary reason in there somewhere.",
