            "URGENT HELP NEEDED\n\nHi everyone,I'm an Italian who had a one-year contract with a Thai company from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. The company's policy states that if an employee fails to come into the office for a certain number of consecutive days, they can terminate the employment. Last Friday, May 31, 2024, I was informed that they did not plan to continue my employment after the contract ended. They mentioned that I would be paid for the last month but was not required to come in since there was no work left for me. This was all documented via email.\n\nFast forward to today, June 7, 2024 Friday, I received an email at 6:30PM stating that the company has cancelled my work permit and terminated me for not coming into the office. They also refuse to pay the full salary for the month. I feel it's not worth going to court as it would waste time and I prefer not to have any legal issues on my record. However, I'm concerned because I've heard that I must leave Thailand unless I go to the immigration office today to apply for an extension.\n\nI was also offered a position at another BOI company and am awaiting the offer letter. Should I contact my potential new employer about this situation immediately?\n\nWhat do you think are my next steps?\n\nThank you so much for your help!",
            "Hi, I\u2019m looking for a reliable online marketplace to buy resale concert tickets. I\u2019m aiming for the Babymonster Fanmeet at the end of this month.\n\nI\u2019ve tried:\n- Viagogo (no tickets available)\n- FB Marketplace (only 1 listing and it\u2019s not the date I can make it)\n- Twitter/X (filled with scammers)\n\nCan anyone help recommend me a site, or know of anyone who wants to sell their ticket? I\u2019m looking for just 1 ticket for the 29/6 show.\n\nThank you. \ud83d\ude4f",

            "**salary range in Agoda**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThis is my first ever post here on reddit and I know like to know about the salary range in Agoda for Asian expats.\n\nI recently had a screening call with one of the recruiters from Agoda. In the call she asked me about my salary expectations for the job and then we agreed that I will write back to her about it. (Quick context, when the recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin and shared the job link, the link was no more available in the website and I did mention that to her on Linkedin)\n\nSo she shared the JDs with me for the two roles, Accounting Manager (AM) and Accounts Receivable Supervisor (ARS). I would like to know what would be the salary range for these 2 positions in Agoda in general. I asked chatgpt and got the range of 80k to 150k baht for AM and 41k to 83k baht for ARS but I would like to know for sure if this is what the current range is, as chatgpt is not up to date with latest data.\n\nFYI, I am currently an ACCA Member and Accounting Manager for a multinational Saas company. I have around 10years of experience in total and 6 years in the Saas company, of which 4+ years are as a Manager.",

            "So my scb account was recently frozen after I sold usdt for thai baht. The exact amount I received from the p2p trader is being held.\n\nBank said the request came from the police so I have to go to the police station in Nakhom Pathom to clear it. Has any one experienced this before?",
            "I am currently in Chiang Mai. Trying to open a regular bank account on EU passport. I've gone to multiple branches of 8 different banks and over 20 branches without a good result - collected all the Pokemons! haha\n\nVisited branches in malls and ones that are further away from the city center. Every single one rejected with almost the same wording - unless you are on 1 year ED visa with a Thai University or other long-term residency visa we cannot help you.\n\nThings were pretty easy even back in January - a bunch of friends opened the account at the yellow bank on a regular 30d tourist visa.\n\nSeems like the regulations have tightened beyond reason. It will be pretty under mfortable staying here for over half a year on educational visa without QR code banking and carrying cash to most places.\n\nI have looked for agents, but their advice was to go on 15 month educational visa with a University, which I am reluctant to commit to.\n\nWhat else can I try to open up an account for day-to-day banking?",
            "My country allows for 90 days visa exemption through bilateral agreements (we allow thais 90 days visa exemption also).\n\nQuestion is, how likely am I to be banned entry if I stay every year just a little below 180 days? Last year I stayed 172 btw. \n\nI'm wondering if they can pull some legality on me to ban my entry, I always come with a return ticket and do only 1 run to Cambodia for another 90 days. Also always carry cash and can prove extensive funds for the months I'll stay."

            "I was going to complain about trains often already being crowded, but one of the BangkokPost comments raised a good point - it looks like a lot of the existing stations are built to support longer trains, so maybe increased ridership will prompt longer trains.\n\nAnd of course more importantly/regardless, this change to lower costs will be good for non-expats who don't have the kind of money that expats do.",
            "I am tentatively hopeful, but I recall there was an academic who said that a better idea would be a flat 50 baht fee for unlimited day rides. I think that that is a way better idea.",

            "So the BTS would no longer have a distance-based fare? Wow",
            "This is a bad idea as it is.  They should instead add a lot more capacity before decreasing fares.  \n\nThey have extra room at stations to add at least 4 more carriages per trip.\n\nBut then again, populist politicking...",
            "What do yall think? I would be ok if the standard price is capped around 50B, but make available attractive deals for monthly/annual tickets that work on everything. This would help the residents while still allow the transport authorities to make some money from visitors.",
            "Billions of baht in subsidies for riders in Bangkok while the rest of the Kingdom gets completely ignored when it comes to public transit.",
            "I can guarantee you that about longer trains. There\u2019s an old book about BTS when it just came out and written by one driver. The station is designed and able to accommodate 6 bogeys form the book, however, currently they only use 4 and it\u2019s stuck at 4 for a long time.(It was originally 3 at the start.)",
            "High demand for mass transit is a good thing, it means less congestion and more efficiency overall. \n\nTrain crowding should be solved by increasing train lengths and decreasing lead times, not by pricing commuters out of using mass transit."
