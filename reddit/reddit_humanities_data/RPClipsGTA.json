            "The Jessi vs Ramee conflict has been the most enjoyable part from this war, I really hope that fake wedding plan happens",
            "Its been a fun one to watch. One side isn't steamrolling the other. You also have the Jessi v Ramee side conflict.",
            "Barry and MrK should arrange the wedding of Ramee and Jessi. They charge an entry fee/receive gifts.. Carmella objects and the wedding is stopped. K and Barry keep the money/gifts.\n\nEasy end with some sbs scammaz",

            "If both groups are of the same mindset and not taking it too seriously then wars are generally always good. \n\nAnother example was the hydra manor war, both of the same mindset and done the right way from both groups, which influences the majority of viewers to behave, though theres always some.",
            "When Barry is awake sure, otherwise its just ADMC hiding in random places like fugitives, not wearing kuttes, not holding down their own block, etc",

            "Which is why it's a fun conflict. Hunting 24/7 isnt fun for anyone. Both sides log on and do their own thing until they meet and have 1-2 fights."
