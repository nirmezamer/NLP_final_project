The bot getting removed has basically made mobile viewing impossible unless I want to download each video to watch and then deleting them afterwards.\u00a0 Also, it's nice to be able to see clips that were removed/deleted for whatever reason.",

            "I really don't understand why he waited last minute for both cases he worked on. he put off becoming an officer 4-5 weeks, worked for hours with Tilly, and grew frustrated with his superiors for making him patrol instead of investigate, all that for the cases to go past the statute. just a few days ago he was saying he wanted to play crim again because investigating was hopeless. Peppo's a great rper, but his decisions are baffling",

            "Coyote the character is just not a good detective despite trying to build the character as one.  He comes up with outrageous theories for the most cut and dry stuff then flat out ignores the most obvious.  Tuggz admitted to Coyote that he was involved not even 12 hours after Aziz died and Tuggz isn't mentioned in the case at all.  That should tell you everything.",
