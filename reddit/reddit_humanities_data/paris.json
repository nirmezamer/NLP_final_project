            "Based on my experience, not every taxi driver will accept a dog, but enough will that I doubt you will have a problem. At CDG, make sure you go to the official taxi line -- I can totally see a scammer inside the airport telling you, \"but those taxis will not take your dog!\" -- and point out to the person tending the line that you have a dog. They will check with the taxi drivers and find one that will accept your dog.\n\nNormally, a taxi from CDG to Bastille is legally fixed as a flat rate of 56, but I think they may be entitled to add a few extra euros for a dog -- not really sure.",
            "Small correction: a basic T+ ticket works on all metro lines, including those that leave Paris and go into other zones (I guess this is about to become more complicated with the metro lines that go to the airport, but its still true as of today).\n\nAlso works on all buses, within Paris, between Paris and other zones, and in general in all zones."

I'm traveling with my wife and our three boys (two teenagers and one seven year old) and of the five of us I know the most French so I'm our cultural attach\u00e9, so to speak. I only just learned to count to ten in French but I haven't met a single person who was anything other than amiable and pleasant. \n\nAmericans who complain about French people being rude are probably coming up to people without even a simple bonjour/bonsoir, not asking if the person they're talking to speaks English before launching into a question, and likely don't even say merci at all.  Little things like that seem to go a long way from what I've experienced (or maybe I'm just extremely charming) and it's easy to see that's how people here interact and mimic it. \n\nI'm sure your patience will be surely tried with the Olympics in town next month so maybe it's for the best that we're leaving now before the craziness arrives.

Its pretty simple no matter where you are, its true americans in america have a special treatment because they want tips...",

            "Thank you for saying this. I visited Paris last month and the Parisians I encountered and conversed with are the nicest people Ive met. Never any attitude. As long as you are respectful of the culture, they will respect you in return.\n\nWhich also leads me to another American stereotype in that Parisians smell bad because of no deodorant. Maybe it was the cooler weather of May, but I didnt smell a single person who smelled badly or reeked of B.O. These stereotypes just need to die already.",
            "I visited Paris, Vienna, northern Italy, London on a trip recently. Parisians were by far the nicest people.",
            "As a French, I'm really happy about what you say but I can assure you that we are generally not very nice, I mean, it's normal to be at least nice if you are so polite with saying hello and ask if you speak english, and if they don't what to answer can just say that they can not speak english.",
            "The stereotype was real like 20 years ago. Was in Paris last year and was shocked at everyone's outward warmth. People were even trying to help us at the subway station, which would have been unheard 15 years ago. Oh! And they speak much better English!",
