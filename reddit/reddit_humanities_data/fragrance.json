I decided to start sampling a few fragrances on my own, spraying them onto test strips and taking my time to appreciate the different notes.

But every time I said I smelled a specific note, such as pickles in the new LV Lovers fragrance, he would argue and tell me that wasn't what I was smelling.

It's fabric! It absorbs literally anything, it's not impressive! \n\nLiterally anything will stick to clothes staaahhp it!!. When a fragrance lasts for days on clothes it doesn't actually last for days!!! It just sticks to fabric because it's fabric!!! \n\n I've come across so many weak fragrances of wich people claim it lasts forever only to find out they meant on CLOTHES!! asside from the fact that fragrance doesn't develop and project the same on fabrick as it does in skin since it can't warm up on fabric and such. I do not want to need to spray on clothes in order for it to last?! When something doesn't last on skin for more then 3 hours but then lasts ages on clothes it is NOT A LONGLASTING FRAGRANE\n\n*ahem*\n\nThere i feel much better now haha. I mentioned this very politely on fragrantica and people just post over it talking again about the amasing longevity as they could smell it on their shirt all day.

Your point?\u201d It\u2019s like dealing with aliens who came to earth and surprised to find the basic fact. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. Measuring SPL is not like that. And your fragrance is not an air freshener let alone **a fabric freshener.**",
            "Well, yes and no. If something doesn't last on clothes, it won't last on the skin. And the other way around. People that deal with perfumes are aware that there is a difference and they do not compare longevity on skin with longevity on fabric, there are different standards for both. Though for winter perfumes I really see no point in being annoyed they are tested on clothes, as this is how they will be worn. Only with summer fragrances I expect them to last on bare skin, and they usually don't.\n\nBtw, I wear perfumes at home, so almost always on my bare forearms. Hence I never-ever got a longevity that people mention in reviews. It is always few hours max. But it is to be expected.",

Ofcourse you can spray on clothes if you want but the performance isn't representative to the fragrance that way also you don't have to spray it on your nipples xD. You spray it on your neck and wrists in ex.. As we all know those to be the common places people spray perfume, not to say you can't spray on clothes I'm judy saying you can't judge the performance correctly if you only spray on clothes xD. I mean we all have our prefference. I spray myself all over usually. Hair, back of the neck etc. I also spray on my shirt but like i said the longevity of the fragrance can't be measured solely by the performance on fabric.\n\nBut no haha please don't walk around naked doused in perfume xD.",
            "You shouldn't base it's longevity off a teststrip and you shouldnt base it off of fabric either. Not saying you can't spray on clothes i am just saying literally everything lasts on clothes so it's not representative. If it doesn't last  more then an hour on skin it has poor longevity no matter how well it sticks to your clothes. :)",
            "If you compare apples to apples it is ok, no? I was comparing Gris Charnel Extrait to it's clone, and actually the biggest difference in performance was on clothes. Liam disappeared in few hours, Gris was still there with all complex notes on the second day. I think it is a great comparison, especially, that one of the things I love about Gris, is how it lingers on winter coats for days without becoming some sort of meh woody amber. Most people will always wear winter perfumes on top of fabric. hence that's how they judge. Unless you go comparing summer freshie worn on a sweaty, bare skin, with a winter perfume worn on woolen pullover (will stay for a weak) it is, imho, perfectly fine."

But I STILL think TF private line is horrifically overpriced. Overrated? I think that's a matter of opinion, though I suppose even \"overpriced\" is... but what I CAN say is it's actually one of very few brands where I like multiple of their offerings. It's rare for me to like more than 1-2 perfumes from a brand, rarer still if I like 3. More than 3? I can count all the brands on one hand.\n\nThe thing I really dig about TF is they straddle that line between mass-market appeal and the unusual with many of their releases.
