They know they can make more money that way and have a wider reach. If it wasn't for Messer, there would be other people offering something for free with comparable quality.\n\nI'm not saying anybody should pirate anything. People can make their own decision about that. However, I do understand that on this forum it is not allowed to post anything copyrighted.",

            "**My Home Lab 0.1**\n\nI started out running the free version of ESXi in VMware Player on my desktop. I gave it 1 TB and 36 GB RAM. It worked ok ish, but having the underlying Windows 10 Pro needing to update & restart got old.\n\n**My Home Lab 0.5**\n\nI got a refurbished HP server with 16 CPU cores, 4 NICs, 2x PSUs, and 128 GB RAM. I slapped a 1 TB SSD in it and only spent about $300 total. I put the free version of ESXi on it.\n\nThe problem with that ESXi is that it only included PowerCLI in read only mode, so you couldn't easily auto provision VMs. It lacked central management as well. It turned out to be a moot point thanks to Broadcom.\n\n**My Home Lab 1.0**\n\nI got a second HP server, same specs but with 192 GB RAM. I put Windows Server 2019 on it, joined the domain, and ran the Hyper-V role. It now hosts most of my VMs.\n\nI wiped the first server and put Hyper-V Server 2019 on it. I then live migrated some VMs to it, namely two of my 4 DCs.\n\nThe two servers share a cheap, desk tall rack. The entire setup was about $1,000 total and all the software is free :D\n\n**So what does this run?**\n\nHybrid AD (4 DCs and member servers running Entra Connect, Entra Cloud Sync, Exchange, Windows Event Collector, and random stuff like one running a Windows Server 2025 Preview), the Domain Users are synced to Entra ID. I have one P2 license and one M365 license on my kid's account (she's a Global Admin, Domain Admin, and her mere user account is synced).\n\nI needed M365 so I could screw around with Intune. I set her up a \"travel system\" that's Entra ID joined and managed via Intune. Everything else is 'on prem' and managed via Group Policy.\n\nThe licenses run me about $30 a month, but I don't have cable and only 1 streaming service, so I see it as a cheap hobby.\n\n**What I'm up to currently**\n\nI IaCed the lab setup for TCM's PEH course and I'm going through the course with it, and troubleshooting my setup as I go. I rarely \\[ok, never\\] write perfect code from the get go. If it's on my GitHub it means I already tested it out and de-bugged it.\n\n**How it's come in handy**\n\n* I go back and check my own cheatsheets all the time.\n* I learned a TON about how to do my actual job by screwing with stuff at home.\n* I basically wrote my Masters Capstone about something I'd done in the lab\n* I cited myself in my Bachelors and Masters Capstone\n\n**Want to know more?**  \n\n\nI have a GitHub and a Medium where I post IaC, queries, howtos, cheatsheets, TryHackMe walkthroughs, etc.",
            "I honestly can't give a super decent answer to this because I don't keep track. Often the things I'm \"labbing\" I need a use for in my home to bring myself to learn it so it feels less like labbing and more like an enjoyable thing to do in my free time lol. A quick example is I couldn't bring myself to just spin up AD for no reason other than to learn it, so I researched how I could make it useful in a home setting. Central authentication was the answer to that. Might not be the most practical for home use but it's the middle ground I work around lol. \n\nAD, GNS3, PiHole, TrueNAS all in Proxmox is currently what I have. I do plan on incorporating some automation with Ansible soon. One thing I emphasize on a resume isn't so much what I lab but the practices I keep in mind with it. Good documentation, backup schedules, stuff like that since all that seems equally if not more important than the technical background to a lot of companies.",

            "The equipment you have now! r/homelab is a wealth of information but it's easy to get distracted by the people with racks and all that. My homelab is mostly stuff I got for free or eventually found dirt cheap. If you have a spare laptop or PC spinup Proxmox on it and start playing around.  \n\nYou can spin up individual VMs on your PC/laptop, setup a network emulator like GNS3 or EVE-NG on any hardware you have laying around etc. Doesn't need to be fancy.\n\n As time goes on and your brain itches for more you can do more. If you want to buy stuff and not spend a ton, find 3 identical PCs or use raspberry Pis and do a Proxmox cluster. That should keep you busy for a while. Proxmox if you aren't aware is a virtual environment that lets you spin up VMs/Containers and incorporate everything together. That's a real simple explanation and the rabbit hole is deep.  \n\nMy personal rule is I try not to buy or get equipment just cause unless I have a reason to get it. Either to solve a problem I'm having or to learn. So don't just buy a fancy router and 48-port switch if you don't know why you need it as an example.",

Be professional, courteous, and be prepared. \n\nPlan to take all exams only once.
