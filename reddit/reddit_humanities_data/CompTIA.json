They know they can make more money that way and have a wider reach.

About two years ago, the A+ certification transitioned from the 220-1001 (first half) and 220-1002 (second half) format. Then, approximately two years ago (technically April 21, 2022), a new version was released. This version required candidates to pass with newer, real-world material to ensure the certification reflects current workplace scenarios: 220-1101 and 220-1102. The next test cycle will commence in spring 2025, featuring the 220-1201 and Core 2 220-1202 exams"

Everyone has their own experiences leading up to it. Although it\u2019s an entry level exam, the portion is pretty sizeable and it takes time to go through everything. Further, it\u2019s an easy read but the exam questions are really tricky. \n\nI was scoring between 60 - 65% after I just finished reading through everything. Practice exams and reviews will be really helpful to get an idea of how the exam will be. \n\nI was hoping to rush through the material and wing the exam so that I can prepare for something more advanced, but I\u2019m glad I gave myself a reality check before scheduling a date! \n\nAlthough it\u2019s only theory, it\u2019s a good learning experience so don\u2019t rush it! \n\nAlso, my waiting time in the queue was almost 2 hours before I could even begin my exam.

Give yourself plenty of time to knock out the applied / situational questions (think theyre called PMAs or something) because you can really lose yourself and time trying to think through them. I started the exam by trying to knock all of those out first and then getting the term based questions last. I finished with like 5 minutes to spare and had little time to go back and review (which is probably a good thing since I overthink things). I agree with the exam not being hard but it will for sure test your ability to problem solve and use critical thinking in a fast paced situation. If I have anymore advice, it would be just to go in with a clear mind and try to stay relaxed. The worst enemy for this test was myself and my procrastination but once I completed it successfully, it gave me such a sense of accomplishment! Absolutely worth every minute you put in!!",

            "I honestly can't give a super decent answer to this because I don't keep track. Often the things I'm \"labbing\" I need a use for in my home to bring myself to learn it so it feels less like labbing and more like an enjoyable thing to do in my free time lol. A quick example is I couldn't bring myself to just spin up AD for no reason other than to learn it, so I researched how I could make it useful in a home setting. Central authentication was the answer to that. Might not be the most practical for home use but it's the middle ground I work around lol. \n\nAD, GNS3, PiHole, TrueNAS all in Proxmox is currently what I have. I do plan on incorporating some automation with Ansible soon. One thing I emphasize on a resume isn't so much what I lab but the practices I keep in mind with it. Good documentation, backup schedules, stuff like that since all that seems equally if not more important than the technical background to a lot of companies.",

My homelab is mostly stuff I got for free or eventually found dirt cheap. If you have a spare laptop or PC spinup Proxmox on it and start playing around.  \n\nYou can spin up individual VMs on your PC/laptop, setup a network emulator like GNS3 or EVE-NG on any hardware you have laying around etc. Doesn't need to be fancy.\n\n As time goes on and your brain itches for more you can do more. If you want to buy stuff and not spend a ton, find 3 identical PCs or use raspberry Pis and do a Proxmox cluster. That should keep you busy for a while. Proxmox if you aren't aware is a virtual environment that lets you spin up VMs/Containers and incorporate everything together. That's a real simple explanation and the rabbit hole is deep.  \n\nMy personal rule is I try not to buy or get equipment just cause unless I have a reason to get it. Either to solve a problem I'm having or to learn. So don't just buy a fancy router and 48-port switch if you don't know why you need it as an example.",

It worked ok ish, but having the underlying Windows 10 Pro needing to update & restart got old.\n\n**My Home Lab 0.5**\n\nI got a refurbished HP server with 16 CPU cores, 4 NICs, 2x PSUs, and 128 GB RAM. I slapped a 1 TB SSD in it and only spent about $300 total. I put the free version of ESXi on it.\n\nThe problem with that ESXi is that it only included PowerCLI in read only mode, so you couldn't easily auto provision VMs. It lacked central management as well. It turned out to be a moot point thanks to Broadcom.\n\n**My Home Lab 1.0**\n\nI got a second HP server, same specs but with 192 GB RAM. I put Windows Server 2019 on it, joined the domain, and ran the Hyper-V role. It now hosts most of my VMs.\n\nI wiped the first server and put Hyper-V Server 2019 on it. I then live migrated some VMs to it, namely two of my 4 DCs.\n\nThe two servers share a cheap, desk tall rack. The entire setup was about $1,000 total and all the software is free :D\n\n**So what does this run?**\n\nHybrid AD (4 DCs and member servers running Entra Connect, Entra Cloud Sync, Exchange, Windows Event Collector, and random stuff like one running a Windows Server 2025 Preview), the Domain Users are synced to Entra ID. I have one P2 license and one M365 license on my kid's account (she's a Global Admin, Domain Admin, and her mere user account is synced).\n\nI needed M365 so I could screw around with Intune. I set her up a \"travel system\" that's Entra ID joined and managed via Intune. Everything else is 'on prem' and managed via Group Policy.\n\nThe licenses run me about $30 a month, but I don't have cable and only 1 streaming service, so I see it as a cheap hobby.\n\n**What I'm up to currently**\n\nI IaCed the lab setup for TCM's PEH course and I'm going through the course with it, and troubleshooting my setup as I go. I rarely \\[ok, never\\] write perfect code from the get go. If it's on my GitHub it means I already tested it out and de-bugged it.\n\n**How it's come in handy**\n\n* I go back and check my own cheatsheets all the time.\n* I learned a TON about how to do my actual job by screwing with stuff at home.\n* I basically wrote my Masters Capstone about something I'd done in the lab\n* I cited myself in my Bachelors and Masters Capstone\n\n**Want to know more?**  \n\n\nI have a GitHub and a Medium where I post IaC, queries, howtos, cheatsheets, TryHackMe walkthroughs, etc."
