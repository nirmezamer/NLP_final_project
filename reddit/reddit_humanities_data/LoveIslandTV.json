            "I need to see the leaks for the guys in casa Amor, I hope they dont do our girls dirty",
            "They have so many people in casa, Joey and Grace will take the majority of the screen time, are you sure the producers let Uma and Wil even do anything?  Probably won't show anything other than their cute reunion after casa. All the girls are some Joey's exes, they won't be bothered by Wil. The casa guys go after Grace so Uma can stay loyal.",
            "I slept on it and now I understand why the producers were okay with dumping Ronnie and Harriet, they essentially didn\u2019t want Ronnie Harriet triangle 3.0 when he goes turbo in Casa and recouples. They have already done this storyline twice this season. Joey is their golden boy so they obviously wanted his love triangle to go on as he\u2019s the main character \ud83d\ude44\n\nWiluma have barely been tested and it would be good to have a more established couple for Casa so they kept them in as well because we still don\u2019t know how either of them will react if one sticks and other recouples.",
            "I know over half of them are friendship only but Jess has got to be in the running for being in the most couples ever during the show-not counting repeat islanders-she\u2019s already been in 5 and with casa she could rack up another one.",
            "I doubt Wil and uma will come back by them selfs, because they didn\u2019t have a chance to close things off or even have a date to solidify their couple , so not sure how that will go.",

            "I have a suspicion that in the recouping Jessy was gonna pick Wil but changed it at the last minute because of the exchange he had with Uma. Cause when she picked Joey he said he didn\u2019t know it would be him and she said \u2018me neither\u2019 or something along those lines"

She and Joey humiliated Samantha snogging in FRONT of her the same day Joey broke off with her. It came across as incredibly cruel and spiteful from both of them and she was kinda belittling Samantha for acting upset when it was Joey at fault for giving them two different stories.\n\nI wasn't a fan of Samantha tbh. But Grace is ridiculous trying to play victim rn when she was fine with him leading on a normal gal for TWO WEEKS in front of national TV.

            "no I'm sorry Jess had to go. Like she was kind of hateful towards Harriet from the beginning when they both tried to talk to Ronnie. Harriet told her exactly what Ronnie was saying to her, then when Jess confronted Ronnie he lied to her face and basically said Harriet was lying. Jess doesn't like Harriet over a boy who didn't even really like her to begin with.",

Love Island producers wouldn\u2019t know what good tv is if it slapped them in the fucking face omg I\u2019m fuming.\n\nI don\u2019t want to sound crazy and bitter but I find it extremely hard to believe that Harriet & Ronnie, who\u2019ve been entertaining us consistently since day one, got the least votes. Less than Grace and Konnor especially. I was looking forward to Harriet bringing all 6 men back from Casa Amor and Ronnie doing a mad one too it would have been so delicious to watch but RIP \ud83e\udea6 \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f ",

            "It\u2019s hard to believe but it\u2019s true. In the UK, it\u2019s illegal for TV shows that use public voting to lie about the results. I think most people liked Grace\u2019s attitude towards the Joey-Jessy situation and that partially influenced the votes (to what degree though? I don\u2019t know)",
            "Id say the whole Harriett, Ronnie and Jess drama has been some of the most tiring, dull and painful drama we've had.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRonnie told Harriett it's over between them, and she was then devastated about this, then a week later she came crawling back and didn't care how she was treated by him, she let him walk all over her.\n\n\nHarriett would've stayed loyal whilst Ronnie strays and then cue a repeat of the Liam and Millie storyline which everyone is sick of.",
            "I am sorry but Harriet and Ronnie drama is already going on for weeks and we always know how it will go. He would play around and mess around. She would cry. Once no one wanted him, he would get back with her for safety. She would boast like he picked her and not like she was the emergency coupling. \n\nLike Harriet and Ronnie drama would be interesting if it was them coupled up all this time and cracked in casa and didn't get back together. We are all tired of them doing the same things over and over.",
            "On one hand, I\u2019m happy they finally listened and didn\u2019t let the islanders send someone home, and I\u2019m not a fan of either Harriet or Ronnie so I don\u2019t personally care. But I agree that sending them home now didn\u2019t really make sense, what\u2019s the point in sending three non-couples to Casa Amor, when we could\u2019ve at least had another couple with a proper storyline",
            "I think the timing of the vote really mattered here. Regardless of her being a hypocrite plenty of people would still feel bad for Grace on account of Joey's atrocious moves. Konnor is likeable to the extent that we've seen him so might have also grabbed a few pity votes.\n\nRonnie's connection to Harriet was completely unbelievable, and Harriet's tendency to cry and be a bit of a pushover with him had played out. I think this is why what happened happened.",
            "For those who don't like Jess, just think of the satisfaction if Trey recouples and she's left standing alone.\n\nIt's time for new storylines and fresh humblings.",
            "I\u2019m actually a teenie, tiny bit disappointed that Ronnie left. He\u2019s a tool, but he was mad entertaining.",
            "A lot of people disliked Harriet unfortunately. So she probably didn't get that many votes. Compared to Grace and Konnor or people are more lukewarm towards",
            "I wish they could have stayed for movie night because some of the worst things islanders accused Harriett of doing weren\u2019t true.\n\nThe issue is she did so many other things that upset people that is was easy for everyone to assume the worse.\n\nI guess I was hoping for a final conflict with Jess after she knew everything from movie night. Oh well."
