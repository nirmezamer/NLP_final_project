            "So how many Casa people will say this year that they\u2019re going to take everyone\u2019s men, step on toes, won\u2019t mind breaking up a couple and so on. There\u2019s always someone like that and then ends up doing none of that at all.",
            "I've realised the producers basically choose who they want to keep, they run a poll with the public and if it meets who they want to dump, they'll use that. If it results in someone who they want to keep, they'll make the islanders choose, 80% of the time it probably gets rid of/keeps who the producers want",

None of the girls in have been interested in him, except maybe Jessy, who recently came in but was the producer pushed to pick Joey. \n\nIf there's someone who's Ayo's type in Casa Amour, I believe he would stray.",

            "I'll start by saying I dont think shes a bad person,  shes funny but pretty naive. I dont mean this to sound cruel but having met quite a few Harriet's in my life I think she's just quite a spoilt princess type who has always been tip toed around and made to feel like she's the centre of the world. She takes anyone disagreeing with her or conforting her about her behaviour as bullying and just cries so that they'll stop. She'll go round saying and doing what she wants but when she's on the receiving end she can't handle it \ud83e\udee0 I know someone just like her who I've known to do and say some awful things but her parents in particular just back her even when she's done something wrong and never hold her accountable so she never realises that her behaviour wasn't acceptable so she just continues on with the genuine belief that she is never in the wrong.\n\nI do think Jess is right about her not being able to take it but she is also mean and disguises it as being \"direct\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "no I'm sorry Jess had to go. Like she was kind of hateful towards Harriet from the beginning when they both tried to talk to Ronnie. Harriet told her exactly what Ronnie was saying to her, then when Jess confronted Ronnie he lied to her face and basically said Harriet was lying. Jess doesn't like Harriet over a boy who didn't even really like her to begin with.",

            "they're a couple that fits the audience's (facebook) taste the most. stable week 1 couple, white people, ciaran being the handsome popular guy with the girl who has strong feelings but insecure. they also had the least external drama so they haven't been tested with any bombshells since they got together.\n\ntheir lack of competition also helps, there are barely any solid couples. i also don't think people are truly in love with them as a pairing but the fact that they're the most stable and ciaran is by far the most popular guy.",
            "You see it a lot with couples where the girl is insecure and the boy constantly has to reassure her. I think it may be people who see themselves in Nicole living vicariously through them. Kind of a wanting someone who \u201cloves you so much\u201d he will put up with any of your insecurities even if you treat them badly in the process kind of thing, which isn\u2019t a healthy dynamic.",
            "I'm so bored by them. No investment in them as a couple whatsoever. It's partially production's fault because we just don't see them having any kind of interesting conversation at all.",
            "To me it\u2019s a welsh thing. Right in the beginning Ciaran said that Welsh girls are always trying to wife up and it\u2019s true (as a generalization). I was born there but moved away when I was young and I\u2019ve seen the same behavior in my relatives. They do have a tendency to be more clingy, emotional BUT love big too. And I feel like that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here. To me it\u2019s cute because it\u2019s just how they are\u2026 Nicole is probably planning their wedding out in her head already, which is crazy because Ciaran is only 21\u2026 credit to him though he does seem more mature than tour average 21 year old. That body count would have been the end for me though \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02",
            "It's not toxic if you want example of toxic relationship on love island S10 Jess and Sammy. You people tend to forget everything and harp on things that happened past few days. Nicole and Ciaran was the strongest couple at the start they were getting no screen time bcs there was no fights nothing they were just chilling prob getting to know each other you could of always see them in background. Now you see Nicole being insecure when feelings coming to play  end of last week when Ciaran mentioned in beach hut that he's starting to catch feelings for Nicole everything went upside down Nicole probably started getting feelings aswell being more insecure always trying to overthink things and always fight over nothing but they would always talk it out after she would rant about it. Now past few episodes you again see them just chill in the background no drama no nothing just being together how can you say that is toxic, that girl just wanted to sabotage it bcs it felt too real too fast for probably both of them and that's why Ciaran wented to Ronnie about walking on eggshells.",
            "They aren\u2019t toxic? It\u2019s so jarring watching you lot act like young couples don\u2019t argue. Additionally what woman won\u2019t feel insecure when she finds out the guy she likes has a body count of 120+\n\n![gif](giphy|3o7ZeHhyyo6ZgRU3cY|downsized)",
