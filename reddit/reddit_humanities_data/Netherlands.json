        "content": "This post is meant to cover the answers to questions that are frequently asked in this sub. Please read through the relevant section of this post before posting your question.\n\n**Contents**\n\n* Moving to the Netherlands\n* Housing\n* Cost of living\n* Public transport\n* Language\n* 30 percent ruling\n* Improving this FAQ\n\n# Moving to the Netherlands\n\nNetherlands is a modern country that ranks high in many global metrices on quality of life and freedom. For this reason, it attracts a fair share of attention from people interested in moving here.\n\nIf you are looking to move to the Netherlands to live/work/study, firstly, you would need to secure residency. Apart from the right to residence, you will also need to consider housing and cost of living before you move. See other sections of this post.\n\nIf you hold an **EU passport**, you will be able to freely travel into the country and reside.\n\nIf you hold a **non-EU passport**, generally below are your main options to obtain residency. Each one comes with its own set of conditions and procedures. You can check all the official information on the website of Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Services ([https://ind.nl/en](https://ind.nl/en))\n\n**Work visas**\n\n*Highly Skilled Migrant* : You need to have an advanced degree, a high enough salary and need a recognized sponsor employing you. Typically for people whose skills are in demand in Dutch economy.\n\n*Work Permit* : A more general category covering intra-company transfers, seasonal\u00a0workers, researchers and other employees who might not meet the salary threshold\n\n*Startup visa* : special visa for founders and employees of startups. Typically you need to be funded by a recognized incubator.\n\n*DAFT Visa* : special visa for US citizens that allows starting a business in the Netherlands\n\n*EU Bluecard:* A visa from EU wide program to attract special skilled talent. The advantage is that you can continue the accumulation of residency into/from other EU countries allowing you to get permanent residence or citizenship sooner. Beneficial if you are planning to move to/from another EU country.\n\n**Family visa**\n\nIf you are partner or a dependent child of a Dutch/EU citizen\n\n**Student visa**\n\nIf you participate in an educational program from a recognized Dutch institute\n\n# Housing\n\nCurrently \\[2023\\] the Netherlands is going through a housing crisis.\n\nHouses/apartments for rent or purchase are hard to come by, especially for the entry level housing like 1-2 bedrooms. When such properties do come on market, they are often taken within hours.\n\nSo, it is **strongly advised** to organize your housing BEFORE **arriving** at least for the first 6-12 months. You can look at available properties on Funda ([https://www.funda.nl/](https://www.funda.nl/)) or Pararius ([https://www.pararius.com/english](https://www.pararius.com/english)) This should give you an idea of how much you can expect to spend on rent. The rents/prices can vary depending on the location and size. Typically the rents are higher in bigger cities and go lower as you move away from the center. In addition to the rent, mind that the cost of utilities might be higher/lower than what you are used to paying and estimate based on your situation.\n\n# Cost of living\n\nLike anywhere, the cost of living depends on your lifestyle and preferences. In general, housing is the biggest cost, followed by food, transport and healthcare. Expect to pay 800-2000 EUR/month for rent depending on where you live and 200-1000 EUR for food for a family of 2-4 depending on how often you eat out. Health insurance is around 125 EUR/month for adults (free for children). You can compare plans on a comparison site like [https://www.independer.nl/](https://www.independer.nl/) The basic health insurance plan has the same coverage and own-risk (co-pay) across all insurers and is mandated by law. The premia differ across companies and typically ad-ons like dental or physio make the main difference in what is covered.\n\nUtilities could range from around 300-600 per month for a small house/apartment. Owning a car can oftentimes be quite expensive than what you may be used to, with high taxes, insurance and high cost of fuel.\n\n# Public transport\n\nNetherlands is a small country and is exceptionally well connected with public transport (at least in comparison to other countries). However, it can be quite expensive compared\u00a0to driving, especially for inter-city travels. You can access the full Dutch public transport network of trains, metro, tram, buses and even public bikes using the [OV-Chipkaart](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/en) or [OV-Pay](https://ovpay.nl/en).\n\nYou can of course purchase tickets for a single journey from the ticket booths or kiosks at major stations, although it is often less convenient and more expensive. Google Maps often has good directions including public transport but 9292 ([https://9292.nl/en](https://9292.nl/en)) is the better option which also gives you the estimated costs.\n\n# Language\n\nDutch is the primary language in the Netherlands. However, the Netherlands ranks one of the highest when it comes to proficiency in English. As a visitor or tourist you can get by completely fine without knowing a word of Dutch (although it will help to learn a few phrases, at least as a courtesy). However, if you are living here longer, it would undoubtedly\u00a0benefit to learn the language. Dutch is the only language of communication from most government agencies including the Tax office. At the workplace, it is common for global or technology companies to be almost exclusively English speaking even when there are Ducth\u00a0people. For smaller and more traditional companies, Dutch is still the primary language of communication at the workplace.\n\n# 30% ruling\n\n30% ruling is a special tax incentive meant to attract international talent for the skills that are in short-supply in the Netherland. You can find about it here [https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility)\n\nThe general concept is that 30% of your gross salary will be tax-free. So, if you have a salary of 100k gross, for tax purposes, it will be considered as 70k gross. You pay tax only on 70k. Because of how marginal tax brackets work, the overall benefit translates to you receiving 10-15% more net salary than someone without this benefit.\n\nYou should be aware that this is somewhat controversial since it is deemed to create inequality (where your Dutch colleagues doing the same work get a lower net salary) and because in the end the burden is borne by the taxpayer. Recently the government has been reducing the term of this benefit.\n\nOverall, you should consider this as a privilege and not a right.\n\n# Improving this FAQ\n\n\\[You are reading version 1.0 published 14th April 2023\\]\n\nFor this FAQ to be useful, it needs to evolve and kept up to date. I would see this as a sort of Wiki that is managed by me. I aim to update this post often (say once a few weeks in the start and once a few months as time goes). If there are topics you want to add to this post, please leave a comment and I will update the post. For the long term, if I lose interest or have no time for it (could happen!), then this post can be a basis for a new Wiki or a new updated post maintained by someone else.",

            "Good idea to make this thread, \ud83d\udc4d. Well done. Hopefully people take the time to read this first when they have a question regarding moving to this country.",
            "I think having an FAQ is an excellent idea. However, if it's in the form of a sticky post, then you will have to shoulder all the burden of keeping it updated. Also, AFAIK, Reddit automatically locks all posts (including stickies) after six months. \n\nAs an alternative, you could consider asking the mods of r/Netherlands whether they would be willing to enable the [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/wiki/index/). You could post your guide there, and anyone (or only certain people - depending on what the mods decide) can edit, improve, or expand it. The sticky post at the top of /r/Netherlands could point users to the wiki for answers to their frequently asked questions.\n\n/r/germany did something similar a while back, and their wiki [has grown to be fairly sizeable](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/index/).",

            "Excellent summary, one suggestion: add EU Blue Card as a possible residence & work permit for non-EU immigrants to NL. It's less common than the *kennismigrant* program but it offers an alternative solution whereby someone can be employed by a company which is not a recognized sponsor.",
            "I'd like to add a bit to the language section about socializing and making friends:\n\nAlthough most Dutch people are perfectly capable to carry a conversation in English in a social setting, they are much better at expressing themselves in Dutch. This is part of why it is so notoriously hard to find Dutch friends. \n\nExpressing yourself in a different language in a social situation, with the intent of showing your personality and trying to make friends, takes a lot of effort. Especially if your conversation partner is a native speaker of that language.",
            "Unfortunately, that's not how Reddit works. Your 'FAQ' will be gone from the front page in a few hours. Experience shows people also don't actually read the FAQ linked in the sidebar. So you're going to need to have mods sticky yours. Good luck with that.\n\nIMHO it would be really nice to just have something like this stickied and posts that ignore it removed.\n\nP.s. you might want to consider adding a bit about the 30% ruling also if this does manage to make it into a stickied thread.\n\nEdit: Scratch that, just noticed this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/12khe2g/meta_request_to_mods_for_automoderationfaq_on/jg3sgai/\n\nGood job and great start :)",
            "Maybe add that questions about visa application should be addressed to the IND? \n\nI also would suggest to add info about the healthcare system; like mandatory health care insurance , need to register at GP,  if you can't find it, contact insurance, where to find independer to select insurances, prescriptions from abroad really aren't valid in the Netherlands. Much to say about healthcare.",

            "I think the most important thing to realise here is the dutch culture obsesion with normalcy. There is a saying \"doe normal dan ben je al gek genoeg\". Basicly means act normal, because its crazy enough. They look at you weird because wearing a mask is not normal anymore and it may not even be because of the controversy surrounding it. Put it this way try wearing a very unique stand out fashion style and you will get the same weird look at you."
