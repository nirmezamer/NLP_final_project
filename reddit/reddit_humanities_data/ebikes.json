            "I have this exact bike. Just hit 500 miles on it. My biggest advice is to get some thread glue and check every nut and bolt to make sure it's secured. This bike has a habit of dropping things off while you're riding. Most of the accessories are attached using metric bolts so if you lose them don't use standard bolts to replace them or you're damaging the threads.\n\nI really love the look of this bike, and with some elbow grease it can be a really sweet ride. I get compliments on it all the time.",
            "Thanks so much for the advice. You have good taste I also love the look of this bike. Metric bolts, got it! This bike was right in my budget and so I know it may not be the best out there but for my budget it was the one. 500 miles! I did 15 today, I cannot wait. Cheers",

            "I think its $3000 on Amazon because sellers are severely penalized if they sell something and its actually out of stock, or their listing & store isnt promoted as much if shown as out of stock, so when they have 1 left they just price it as 5-10x.",
