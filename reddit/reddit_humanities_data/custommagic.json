        "content": "Hey everybody, and welcome to Winner is the Judge #807!\n\nThanks to u/Proteusmutabilis for running last week's contest. And sorry for starting late with this, I'm still pretty new to this subreddit and wasn't exactly sure of the scheduling for this contest.\n\nIn addition to Magic, I enjoy playing board games in general, so I thought it would be fun to have this one be about bringing board games into MtG. Whether you want to represent a game in one or two cards, an aspect or part of a game, or even a physical game piece such as a meeple as a Magic card, its fair game. And please avoid meme-ish things like rage-flipping a table.\n\nAs an example, my favorite board game is Terraforming Mars. I recently have been working on designing corporations in the game as a commanders able to be played. My current design is to have there be a CEO legendary creature paired with a \"legendary enchantment - corporation\" that works similar to Choose a Background partner pairing from Commander Legends Baldur's Gate.\n\nAlso, if you are designing a card about a specific board game, please also indicate which game it is, if not immediately obvious, so everyone can check out some more cool games.\n\nI'll Judge Saturday 6/29/24 at 9:00am central time.\n\n\n\nThank you everyone for the submissions, I had a hard time picking my favorite two. However the winner this week is u/PyromasterAscendant representing 7 Wonders and the runner up is u/sumg with \"Forward Progress\"",

            "Thanks for participating! You are this weeks runner up! I really liked how clean this design was, and if the winner didn't have a design that represented the chosen game so well, you would have gotten first.",
            "Are the tokens supposed to be untapping the vagabond, because i think they are currently tapping to untap themselves",
            "I don't see any abilities for this card.",
            "Congratulations, you are the winner this week. I even would have picked yours if you had just submitted one Wonder card. I will admit, I don't care to play 7 Wonders, but the design fits the game so well and reads like a magic card that could actually be created.",
            "These feels like artifacts, maybe thats the way you separate them from classes, but idk.",
            "> But it's definitely possible to make something work in spirit in the rules. I think you could borrow the phrasing from [[Sphinx's Tutelage]]: \"If the two revealed cards have the same mana value, repeat this process\"\n\nBut doesn't this only repeat once?  I.e. if the first two cards are a pair, then you draw another two, but if the second two cards are a pair then you still stop?  I wanted a system that could repeat indefinitely.  It's a low chance, but I can definitely see somebody getting good RNG and drawing 6 or 8 cards off of this because they get a few pairs in a row (only to end up not be able to use all of them).",
            "In card text, ~ (or CARDNAME) never gets printed on an actual card, it always stands in for whatever the card's name ends up being. This means the text doesn't need to be updated whenever the name changes. If the ability untapped the artifact token, it would say \"Untap this artifact\", because there's no single name that can to refer to those artifact in the first place.",
            "That's a good point.\n\nI went with enchantments because cases, quests and classes are all enchantment.",
            "Those tokens don't have refrence for what they are untapping, they need to untap a permanent/creature named the vagabond. Unless you intended for the artifacts to tap to untap themselves?",
            "Nice! Yeah, I figured, it's a cool gamble of a card."

Make your opponent's elf commander into a goblin pig zombie beast mount for instance.",
