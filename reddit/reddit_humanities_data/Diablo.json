            "At D4 launch, I played through the campaign and stopped pretty soon after.  In particular, I was very off-put from playing seasonal due to having to regrind map completion and whatnot.  How is S3 looking?  Is the game in a much better state now?",
            "Diablo IV - PC  \n  \nHey there,\n\nas of S4 something strange is happening on my End.  \nI am playing the PC Version with a Controller (Xbox One Wired/Wireless).  \nIn Beta till the end of S3 i held down a Button to use \"input random skill with CD\" / e.g Sorc' Teleport which then got activated and my Chara were moving along; still while the Button is held down and the Skill being on CD.\n\nBut now, as of S4, my Chara will stand still as long as the Button is held down, like playing with Keyboard and using the \"Hold Position\" Key.  \nStrange thing is - which makes me think that this is an errog/bug - while playing with Keyboard (+Mouse) its working like i am used to it. I am holding down the Key, Skill gets activated, Skills on CD, Key still held down, Chara moves... either with Mouse or via EDSF/WSAD\n\nDo you know which Setting do i need to change to get the old behavior back?\n\ntl;dr  \nhold down Button/Key for Teleport, or any other Skill with CD; does not matter if an Attack or Mobility skill  \nController=Chara does not move while TP has CD  \nKeyboard=Chara does move while TP has CD  \nWhy?\n\nAny Idea?  \nThanks in advance -  Happy Hunting",

I remember from season 0 and 1 that one month probably wasn't really enough time to \"complete\" a season. However I know there's been a bunch of changes and you can at least level up alot faster. \n\nDo you think one month is relatively enough time or should I just wait to come back for a full season in August? \n\nThanks for your opinions!

            "You can pretty casually level to 100 is 10-15 hours from scratch. Speedrunners are doing it in 5ish. I do 8-10 pretty casually. 10-15 hour expectation gives you a lot of wiggle room. I would say 20-25 hours will govern you time to finish seasonal journey, level to 100, level glyphs to 15, and get started on the pits and your masterworking progress. If you can play on average 5-7 hours a week, i would say youve got plenty of time.",

            "You should have plenty of time to blast through the battle pass and season journey if you want to pick up some cosmetics at least. Leveling is faster than ever this season due to Helltides being available in WT 1 & 2, the Mindcage consumable increasing mob levels in Helltides, XP being increased for WT2+, and a bug allowing you to use two Elixirs at once (a regular elixir plus the antivenom quest elixir). Some of the S4 meta builds are confirmed as having bugs boosting their power and will be nerfed next season, including Bash barbs (Bash Temper is multiplicative), shadow summoner necros (a Book of the Dead setting for Reapers gives both effects), and Heartseeker rogues (Victimize key passive double dips its multiplier) so try them out before they go poof.",
