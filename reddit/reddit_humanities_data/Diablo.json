Everyone in Bastion's Keep are despondent about what happened, which includes Haedrig. Meanwhile, in the High Havens, things aren't much better. Diablo is on the loose, corrupting all in the place, angels are dropping like flies, and not only Imperius is royally pissed, Tyrael is in shock, and Auriel had been captured by one of the Prime Evil's lieutenants. Then, after you kill Rakanoth and free the Archangel of Hope, suddenly people at Bastion's Keep are looking more brightly to the future.",

I remember from season 0 and 1 that one month probably wasn't really enough time to \"complete\" a season. However I know there's been a bunch of changes and you can at least level up alot faster. \n\nDo you think one month is relatively enough time or should I just wait to come back for a full season in August? \n\nThanks for your opinions!

            "You can pretty casually level to 100 is 10-15 hours from scratch. Speedrunners are doing it in 5ish. I do 8-10 pretty casually. 10-15 hour expectation gives you a lot of wiggle room. I would say 20-25 hours will govern you time to finish seasonal journey, level to 100, level glyphs to 15, and get started on the pits and your masterworking progress. If you can play on average 5-7 hours a week, i would say youve got plenty of time.",

Leveling is faster than ever this season due to Helltides being available in WT 1 & 2, the Mindcage consumable increasing mob levels in Helltides, XP being increased for WT2+, and a bug allowing you to use two Elixirs at once (a regular elixir plus the antivenom quest elixir). Some of the S4 meta builds are confirmed as having bugs boosting their power and will be nerfed next season, including Bash barbs (Bash Temper is multiplicative), shadow summoner necros (a Book of the Dead setting for Reapers gives both effects), and Heartseeker rogues (Victimize key passive double dips its multiplier) so try them out before they go poof.",
