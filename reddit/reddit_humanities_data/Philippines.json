            "I want my doubts to be cleared regarding school policies. My partner told me that she had to go to her school (MMC, Crim) in Independence Day to make changes for her thesis. Do some schools really allow in-campus access to students on holidays, and are libraries even open? She also had to go to school as her professor instructed on June 17, which is a holiday also. Do some schools really allow this? Is this incompetence on their part? Or am I just lucky enough to be in a decent school and not in low-end schools like MMC?",

They were still conscious, so it didn't trigger.\n\nThey also have problems manually triggering the SOS function because you need to click the power button 3 times in quick succession, they can't press it quick enough to trigger the SOS call.\n\nApple Watch is not an option, it's too expensive and it will likely have the same issues as the Galaxy Watch regarding having them trigger the SOS. It needs to be a simple button for them to trigger.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience using such devices/services? Thanks!",

        "content": "I noticed there's alot of pinoy redditors keep asking if  china is really gonna declare war and fully invade us, land some troops and then take our cities one by one etc\n\nLet me tell you why its fantasy and its not gonna happen.\n\nA declaration of war from china to Philippines is basically a war with America. And would simply not give them any benefit other than a suicide on its economy that would lead to uprising. \n\nAlso alot of people over estimating china's military prowess even if china does really want to invade us they simply don't have the logistics and capability to do an amphibious landing to a country hundreds of miles away would be very difficult task.\n\nOn a hypothetical scenario if a war does really broke out against all logic most of the battles will be at sea and it will be fought with fighter jets, drones, ships, long range missiles and subs. So unless pilot ka or you have useful skills that may be in use in the navy the majority of volunteers Ain't gonna do shit walang masyadong engagements sa infantry katulad ng ukraine, ang magagawa mo manuod nalang sa social media ng updates.\n\nChinese military is not on par yet with the united states even if they claim be, its all talk shit just like russia they know this and that's why they are frustrated and lash out their desperation and frustration to our coastguard. \n\nAlso alot of people say america would ditch the Philippines in case of a blown out war. Well america will definitely defend the Philippines but not because they are doing it out of the kindness of their hearts but its necessary for their national interest, they will be forced to defend us wether they like it or not. Not honoring the MDT would simply be a disastrous for america and its allies around the world and would mean an end for US hegemony.\n\nSo in summary china will not wage a full scale war on us but the harrassment and bullying will continue to escalate in WPS their main goal is to exhaust and intimidate the Philippines coastguard and navy.\n\n So we better buckle up cause were in for a long haul.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Philippines) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
            "Exactly. For China, it's much much cheaper and more practical to do misinformation campaign and paying off politicians (this is what they are doing now) than going full retard and actually start a war.",
            "Exactly, China would more likely wage an *economic war* rather an actual war. Canada, Japan, Australia, and South Korea have spoken out for the Ph in this skirmish. Not to say China also signed UNCLOS .",
            "Natatawa na lang ako sa mga warmongers.\n\n# War is costly, people\n\nWhen you have complex interdependence at play, and you have various avenues for \u2018cooperation\u2019 (loose term), it is not in China\u2019s best interest to go all out. This is, however, not discounting how messy a shift of power is. Still, an all out war is the last thing in China\u2019s mind in my opinion.",
            "A lot of people are folding because they see the number of China\u2019s boats and let me tell you, it\u2019s not the number of equipment you have that makes a military strong. You can look at the US and see it is not their number that makes them the best military in the world. I watched the video of the harassment and it\u2019s just laughable. The Chinese needs their 20 people to be armed even with their better boats to deal with 8 Pinoys. This means they need 3x the advantage to deal with us. This only shows they\u2019re more afraid of us and their strength is just for show when they couldn\u2019t even use their tech advantage properly. Also see that their people are in life jackets like babies while ours are in fatigues. Mas malusog pa nasa Sierra Madre kesa dun sa Chinese. No wonder our troops show no fear in their stance and voice; they\u2019re like staring at a shi tzu barking. \n\nAlso a lot don\u2019t understand the Mainlander mindset. Due to the one child policy, the soldiers they have today are the unico hijos of their families. Kill one Chinese soldier, wipe two bloodlines. Also because of the shit their government puts them through, they trust no one but themselves. Because of their scamming culture, they do not trust their own people\u2019s work (their equipment). Their morale is very easy to break and if you break them, they\u2019ll all fold quickly. And with how misogynistic they are and their women being physical weaklings, it\u2019s very easy to make their whole country fold. \n\nSo tatagan lang loob natin. We are not born and made to live in a country of natural disasters just so we can be beaten by spoiled brats.",
            "Thank the gods, finally someone is also saying this. Parami ng parami ang fearmongers, halatang mga walang alam sa geopolitics and history. Add ko na din na unlike Russia which have warlike tendencies even before they became a unified nation state, China is averse to fighting a war due to being Mister Krabs personified, as you've mentioned, and the fact din na last few times they did so in the modern day - they got their asses kicked. Tibet lang ang success nila and that was because it's a barely defended region. Mas takot pa ako sa AFP and our kababayans losing their s\\*\\*t and doing something we'll all regret. They don't even dare invade Taiwan, what more us.",
            "Daming doomers dito lately eh, di nagiisip ng tama puro jump into conclusion na magkaka gyera na. Kaya nga dinodownplay ng government kahit mahirap kasi ayaw nila mag escalate into something worse.",
            "The filipino mindset should be we're already at war with them.\n\nEconomically, psychologically, and cyber.",
            "Taiwan nga hindi nila matuloy tuloy plano nilang invasion tayo pa kaya. Its no secret that China wants to \"liberate\" Taiwan kahit na theyre de-facto independent already. We are just a petulant neighbor in their eyes",
            "Exactly there is no benefit to war, but they cannot show that they are weak as well so they will do the next best thing - posturing and harrasing us"

An enabler of pro-Russian rhetoric in the States and the West\n4.
