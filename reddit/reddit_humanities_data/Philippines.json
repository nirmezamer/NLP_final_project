Typical of us to ask for Tulfo-like management when there is a process of the courts.\n\nHis only fault if anything was that he could not seem to replace people like Abaya and Roxas. But the issues with Abaya and Roxas may also be an issue with our NEED to see managers/supervisors administer with precise micromanagement of issues without a deep understanding of underlying operations.\n\nLet's drop the Duterte propaganda. He was the best and is the bar from which all 21st century presidents/candidates have to be assessed against.\n\nLeni came close. But Leni did not become a president. While her vice presidency was commendable. We haven't seen her actually become a president and go through the gauntlet.\n\nAt a time when China bullied us he filed for arbitration.\n\nHis presidency was the first time a president in recent memory got escorted by PAF jets!\n\nHIS PRESIDENCY IS THE BEST BECAUSE HIS TERM, MORE THAN THE ECONOMY AND FA50s, GAVE ME HOPE OF A BETTER PHILIPPINES.",

BPO was growing.\n\nI don't think people understand that the Peso is currently worth 40% LESS now than it was when Aquino was president.  And for a country that imports simple things such as rice and fish, no wonder everything is so much more expensive now.",

Yung presyo ng bigas at pamasahe na easy indicator ng economy natin, he managed to stabilize and maintain at a low price.\n\nThen after nya wala na. Palubog na ang pilipinas. Lalo pa lulubog kasi voters are getting more stupid. Pnoy could be the last decent president in our history.",

As someone who constantly travels, during his time, Filipinos were seen as people who can afford to travel. Sabi pa ng ibang foreigners na rising tiger daw tayo and we had a booming economy. Years later nung si PRRD na, iba na ang madalas na comments. Mas lalo na nung napabalik ang Marcoses sa power lol my Aussie boss even told me, whyd you guys vote for him lol sagwa tlaaga. You can say whatever you want about Noynoy but i\u2019m sure we were in a better place before than where we are now."
