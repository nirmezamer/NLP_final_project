It was not until my 3 friends (1 im close with, 2 not really) started to discuss it outside of the stall that I realized what I had done. They all started to laugh uncontrollably. I was mortified. There was also a stranger in there who started to say it\u2019s normal etc. AgainC everyone seemed pretty drunk but this quickly turned into the worst moment of my life. I was laughing with my bestie after but I still felt horrible. About 10 minutes later I still felt horrible and began to tear up and eventually cry in the social. My close friend tried to reassure me that it happens to everyone but I still felt horrible. On my way home I began to bawl my eyes out and started to think of other embarrassing moments in the past. Is there a better way to handle this situation? ",

No, it\u2019s not just in my head. It has been confirmed by the people around me. They actually told me first before I noticed myself. I am pretty sure I am autistic to add on to this.\n\nI do not leave an event without causing disruption. I do not realize how obnoxious I am coming across. I have tried to become self aware of this but I continually fail at that. I get told about the way I acted after I left an event and I cannot believe what I have done. I do things that I hate to see other people doing. I am always in disbelief that I am acting the way I am.\n\nIn social situations, I do not know how to respond like an adult. I automatically respond like an 11 or 12 year old that is trying to hard to be funny and quirky. That is how I acted at that age, and I do not know how to not have that part come out of me. It\u2019s extremely embarrassing and I do not want to act like that anymore.\n\nI also have been told that I come across as cocky and rude. I am always shocked to hear this. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than others but I apparently have a really cocky attitude. I also almost never mean to be rude to anybody. I do not know why it comes across this way.\n\nMy friend\u2019s reputations have been ruined because of me. If I go with them anywhere, they all leave hated because of me. They told me they like me but sometimes they wish I wouldn\u2019t go with them because they are guaranteed to be hated because of my actions. These horrible flaws are not only affecting me, but they affect others too.\n\nA lot of the time, I choose to not speak as much as possible because I know if I do, it will end horribly bad. It shouldn\u2019t be this way. I shouldn\u2019t be lacking this much self control at 26 years old.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even all of my issues.

Once you know the your specific issue(s) you can start to implement better coping or known treatments. \n\nKnowing it\u2019s an issue is a good first step. A lot of people stubbornly refuse to admit they have an issue, so they miss opportunities to fix it and just keep creating the same situations over and over.",

I was confused because I wasn\u2019t saying or doing anything vulgar and was ashamed because I had no idea what I was doing wrong.\n\nDon\u2019t let these people keep you miserable.

Role play/social stories/scripting can be very useful, as everyone has mentioned. \n\n This is what would be involved:  Ask your (former) friends to describe the situation, how you responded, why it was weird, and what a more socially acceptable response would have been.  Or at least bring the situations you know about to a therapist \n\nHow do you learn best?  If visually, write it all down and study.  If aurally/orally, record the information and then repeat it back out loud.  \n\nThen the role play.  You ask a couple of folks to rehearse the situations with you.

Maybe it's my verbal speech, mannerisms, body language etc. I dont know. It will just trigger some sort of primal instict in them. \n\nThey'd start to be a bit passive agressive, even targeting me a bit but the degree that could be easily passed off 'playing' or 'a bit ot banter' to non sensitive people. But I could feel the vibe is off and i dont feel as safe. then they up the ante. In some cases things might escalate to full blown bullying but that is rare\n\nMost of the time i just let it go. But at times Id stand my ground, stop the friendly voice and adopt a more lower voice and curt response, and stare at them. I might snap at them if they dont get the message. But I realize doing this often would lead to me being disliked and avoided by most people. But many people do things that would lead me to this level in the first place and they have friends as well, so id end up being disliked by many people\n\nSo the ideal solution is just not be 'bullyable' in the first place. Don't have a personality that provokes people so I dont have to fight and be disliked by people. Throughout my life I have to choose between being weak or being dislike and avoided.\n\nWhat do you think of this? How do i fix this?\n\n",

            "I relate to this. It was honest painful to read. Best thing you can do is stand up for yourself and not hyperfixate on what others think about you. Easier said than done, but a lot of people can sense the insecurity which is why they bully.",
            "As someone that has been bullied when younger, and doesn't get bullied now, I'd say you're on the correct path in the \"not being bullyable\" path of thinking. What I gather is that bullying often comes from insecurity and make themselves feel better by pushing others down. And thus, my remedy has come in the form of making people feel better without them needing to put anyone down. \n\nThis can be done by building a stronger personality (wit, humour, interests, ... ) and listening skills (empathy, active listening, ... ), so that people enjoy being around you, without any subtle power hierarchies needing to be created. This is way harder and more comlicated than what can be summarized in a single Reddit comment, but \"How to win friends and influence people\" might be a solid read to help build these qualities.",
            "Most autistic people can relate to this. There's just something monstrous in a lot of people during social situations that doesn't come out until they realize someone is different than them.

It sounds pessimistic, but most people really do suck and there's no point in trying to be friends with them. Just don't make your relationship any worse than it has to be if they're someone you have to be around a lot, like coworkers. For friendship, you just have to find people that like you for how you are. A lot of people just aren't accepting to people that don't exactly fit in with them or their friends or people like them.",
            "I can relate to a lot of what your saying and I\u2019ve faced similar struggles in the past, although I feel I\u2019m getting better. \n\nHonestly I think certain people will bully you if they sense you are insecure and not confident. People can pick up on weakness quite quickly which is why once they\u2019ve sussed you out they start pushing your boundaries. \n\nThe best thing you can do is be try to be friendly and approachable, but also come across as confident and not an easy target. Even if you have to fake it, especially with body language. Bully\u2019s will always pick on people they think won\u2019t fight back. \n\nWould it be fair to say you\u2019re not the most confident person? Are you socially awkward? \n\nTry to come across as confident and friendly and 99% of people will be fine with you. At least that\u2019s my experience, as I can totally resonate with you when you said you either have to choose between being weak or disliked. But there is a middle ground you have to find, where your not a pushover, but your also not an asshole. \n\nAnyway I hope my comment helps, I wish you the best of luck.",
