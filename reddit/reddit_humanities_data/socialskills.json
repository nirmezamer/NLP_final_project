            "I have never done the solo bar thing personally. I certainly will go to a bar and sit down and have fun by myself. But standing at the bar trying to meet people? Nah",
            "Honestly my first response is that not many (even confident) people actually do this so I'd say you don't need to force yourself to. There are some bars where people largely stick with the party they come with and it's hard to just go up to someone and talk, and others have a more \"inclusive\" atmosphere where everyone talks with everyone. Someone with local knowledge of bars might be able to help with that, I'm told there's a bar in the latter category in my city (where if you stand around looking friendly people will start conversation, apparently) and I do plan to go at some point. Otherwise the only time I've spoken much with strangers at a bar is when it's out of seats, some people want to sit at your table and a conversation gets going.\n\nHave you exhausted interest groups, board game nights, stuff like that? They would be easier by an unbelievable order of magnitude. I really need to stress how hard what you're describing is haha, if you get anywhere with it that's miles more than non-socially anxious people do. It would really be an amazing step.",

            "I don't know that this works in modern bars. Bars used to be meeting places where people are curious about strangers and feel connected to regulars. But in the social media world, I'm not sure if that works any more.\n\nI would suggest that, instead of bars, that you think about volunteer organisations instead.",
            "IME not as many ppl go to clubs to meet new people. It\u2019s usually to stick to the friends they came with. Don\u2019t take it personal; a mixer type event where the expectation is to meet someone new would probably go over better",

            "So number 1, unless you're a particularly\u00a0natural socializer, doing anything with the sole purpose of \"meeting girls\" tends to backfire, people can tell and don't like it.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I have a friend who is good at the solo bar scene and what I've observed is that he just talks with anyone. He particularly ends up making friends with bartenders, but also just other people who sit next to him. He does NOT just seek out girls he's attracted to, he strikes up a conversation with whoever is next to him, is in conversation with other people, then ends up looping in others if it feels relatively natural.\n\n\n\nTldr, just go to make friends. The better you are at that, the more likely the other stuff is to happen.",
            "Hi. This reply assumes you're talking about the Saturday-night-everyone-gets-drunk-and-dances club. And not a networking event, or some after-party, or where the people are in any other way associated.\n\n>I don't know how people do it lol, this feels like an insurmountable step.\n\nI'm not sure whether you this this \"going to bars solo\" is common. The whole scenario you've laid out is extremely rare - most I've seen of people going solo (and not as a result of breaking off from another friend group), or else are very, very self-confident and social. These are the type of people that are basically \"the soul of the party\". Or alternatively, they're just very skilled at picking up the opposite sex.\n\nAnd so rather than \"how people do it\", it's more likely \"I don't know how the top 1% most confident people do it\". And with you having social anxiety, is it quite fair and realistic to compare yourself to the top 1% (I actually think it's less than 1%, especially if we're talking about people who can do so and socialise successfully)?\n\nBecause most people wouldn't go into a club solo if you paid them to - most of them need to be half-drunk just to have enough confidence to dance in public.\n\n>But the whole making friends, talking to girls thing?\n\nWhich one? I can understand hookup culture (hence mentioning that who successfully pickup girls whilst going solo usually are already good at picking up girls).\n\nAs for making friends... well, having a nice chat is one thing. But as for exchanging numbers, that's a lot more difficult unless if they see a networking opportunity (you already coming in with friends increases your social status), or if they're romantically inclined.\n\nAgain - most friends in clubs didn't usually meet each other through going solo previously. If you want a new social circle then you can continue with the club, but there's often much more efficient and effective ways of making new friends.\n\nIn case you haven't guessed, I'm mainly talking through experience. But if you're doing it all just for a night of fun social experimenting, feel free to have fun. Just be sure that your expectations are realistic - otherwise, it could backfire on your self-esteem."

            "Why? What is your goal? IMO talking with coworkers or classmates is a better way to learn genuine social skills and build deeper relationships. With strangers, everyone is putting on a \u201cmask\u201d and engaging in surface-level conversation. It may be a good way to improve your polite small talk, but don\u2019t expect it to go any further than a one-time interaction.\n\nSome ideas:\n1. Small talk with employees who aren\u2019t busy and seem to have idle time. Ex. A security guard sitting at the counter who greets everyone who walks through the doors. NOT a busy waiter (if the restaurant is slow and they seem to stick around, you can exchange a few sentences)\n2. Any public place where people seem to be waiting around a lot. Ex. People sitting in the hot tub at your community pool, people waiting in a long line (who aren\u2019t occupied with kids or anything else)\n3. Ask someone for advice on something (ex, what drink you should get, which clothing article looks better on you at the mall), using that to pull them into a broader conversation \n\nThese aren\u2019t hard and fast rules, but it would be easier to have a successful conversation under those circumstances. \n\nIf you\u2019re incredibly funny, personable, and/or charismatic, you can get away with more. For example, one time when I was 16, I was browsing through clothing racks and a woman thrice my age randomly turned to me and asked me for advice on which shirt she should get. Immediately, I could feel her dynamic and friendly vibe, and we started talking and joking like close friends. Normally, you couldn\u2019t get away with striking up a convo with someone not even half your age, and a minor at that - at least, I wouldn\u2019t attempt it - but this woman was able to get away with it because she was fantastic at small talk and gave off good vibes. Also, she understood how far she could push the social boundaries. If she were a guy, she may not have been able to get away with it no matter how personable she was! Start slow and work up!"
