            "Can you choose to only have a certain time period in civ 6? Like if I just want it to be the classical swords and horses and not expand into modern tech and armies can I set a game up with a stopping point?",
            "Did anybody try the new monthly challenge, Terra Ingognita? \n\nI've been enjoying them so far and although I like the idea of the current one, it seem very broken.\n\nEven on emperor it's trivially easy to rush Cartography and just take over the entire new continent before other nations even bother to explore, leaving you with insane resources and luxuries.\n\nIn my quickly finished game at Prince, London had two cities that could do nothing but rebel at disadvantageous locations. Liking the idea I started again on Emperor, and it was even smoother other than slightly more trigger happy Barbarians...",
            "I got into a game where I couldn\u2019t for the life of me set up any campuses with greater than 1 adjacency bonuses. How do I overcome this? I fell way behind on science and never caught up.",
            "Hi. I'm new here, so don't know if I ask in the right place, but anyway. I have R&F, my friends don't. Can I do anything to play as Genghis Khan in game with my friends? Or we all need to own R&F?",
            "How good does Civ VI work on the Nintendo switch? Is it playable or is it very laggy?\n\nAnd is the Anthology dlc worth it (on switch)?\n\nEdit: I bought the base game! Because it\u2019s \u20ac3! Now the question about the Anthology DLC still stands, right now also on sale for \u20ac20",
            "Is \u201cGod of the Sea\u201d pantheon applied only proactively to new fishing boat improvements? \n\nI had several already improved fishing improvements in my civilization when I picked this pantheon, but I am not seeing any improvements to production from these. I just improved a fishing tile since I picked pantheon, and I see the extra production. \n\nIs there a way around this? This is stupid, but is it worth it to get a builder, destroy all fishing improvements, and rebuild them? Feels like a waste to do pantheon without the tiles I already own",
            "Is $25ish the cheapest the Civ 6 Anthology gets? I saw it listed on steamDB for $11.50 but only for a single day",
            "I have been playing Civ V for years but I have never managed to win the game at level 5. Does anyone have any suggestions for strategies to try so I can beat it? Which leader is the best? \nThanks! :) \n(ps I don\u2019t have any dlc or anything fancy like that)",
            "Got a new pc and am wondering if you could transfer your hall of fame to your new pc\n\n\nMy new pc hall of fame has all leaders not highlighted and the victory type/amount of victory tries.\n\nIs there a way to transfer the files over?",
            "Is there any way to edit existing game saves to remove a mod depndency? I started a game on Windows and it had the Julius Caesar mod enabled - although I'm pretty sure the game doesn't use it in any way, but I then tried to transfer that save over to a Linux machine and, although it can find the save, it won't load it because the Julius Caesar mod isn't installed. \n\nI have connected to my 2K account, but I'm still not getting JC. I also tried contacting 2K support who said I need to contact Aspyr support - and their support site isn't working for me!"

            "I really hope they keep some version of the district system. I feel like it adds so much to the gameplay and look of the map.",
            "I would like more variety between different Civs. Venice from Civ5 was a great example. Having a Civ which could, for example, work five tiles from the capital instead of 3 would be amazing even if they had other penalties and would make the game totally different for different players",
            "I\u2019m very worried about the multi-platform launch. The fact that a switch can barely run Civ VI but will be a Civ VII launch platform reads to me like VII will not even come close to pushing the envelope of 10 years of compute advancements since the Civ VI engine.",
            "Some things id like: \n\nI want  more alt leaders focused on different victory types for the same civ. Catherine can stay for culture for France but add Napoleon for domination and war. Japan can easily have different leaders that focus on either war, culture or even science/industry. \n\nI'd love even more, even bigger True Start Maps. Give us True Start China and let a dozen different Chinese dynasties compete to become the most powerful. True Start Africa so African civilizations get more focus.\n\nGive us scenarios again but make them even better. Add a Sengoku period scenario to unify Japan, or even alt history scenarios like conquering Europe as the Mongols.\n\nMAKE NAVIES MORE IMPORTANT!",
            "1: I would like to see is more contemporary/modern era civilizations or units like the Soviet union, Peoples republic of China, Argentina and post-reunification Italy. \n\n2: Another thing I would like is MAD/mutually assured destruction. One thing I liked about Humankind was when you launched a nuclear bomb it took a turn so it gave the enemy a chance to launch but in civ who ever declares war first is the one to launch and hit in the same turn which feels like the total opposite of the purpose of nuclear bombs which is to deter aggression. \n\n3: No Asset limit along with more life to city's something akin to the City Sprawl Graphics mod for civ6 to make city's feel more thick and dense and really urban. Maybe little trains on train-tracks you make   \n  \n4-This ones more of a loose idea but some sort of minor nation mechanic that works almost identical to city states, I like city states but I feel like bigger entities (thinking 2-4 citys) that are non-player would allow more opportunity's as well as provide better interactions between majors and minor nations with new diplomatic dynamics. It always felt off or strange that the world is filled with these massive powers like Russia and the United states and the only other political entity there is are these tiny 1 city states. I do see the glaring issue that I feel as if it would be difficult to add and make it feel civ-like (as well with lag from Ai troop spaml)."
