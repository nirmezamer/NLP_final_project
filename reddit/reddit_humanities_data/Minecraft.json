        "content": "Hello, everyone.\n\nYou might've heard about an incident regarding one of our moderators removing a post that we and many others believe shouldn't have been removed. That moderator has been the head of this sub for a long time and decided to resign today, at the rest of the team's request. We wish them the best.\n\nConsequent with this, the subreddit is now under new management. We want to do the best to make things right for the community and do better where the sub's previous management had failed. Effective immediately, all remaining transparency moderators will be converted to regular moderators. We will also be recruiting new moderators soon and will bring new people onto the team accordingly.\n\nThis is going to be a bumpy ride for a little while, but we're confident everything's going to turn out well in the end. Please be patient, as we may be a bit slow to respond to modmails for a little while as we go through this phase. If you have any questions, feel free to let us know in the comments.\n\n~ New r/Minecraft Management",
