Idk what I should say to him i Alr mentioned to him about his girlfriends daughter is 23 and plays with Lego so why can\u2019t I play Minecraft but he still ain\u2019t buying it",

            "There's something very, very wrong with the way your family works if your dad is accusing you of grooming children in a video game without evidence. Grooming is a serious matter; he shouldn't be throwing around baseless accusations (provided you aren't actually grooming children). Also, what right does he have to tell you what to play and not to play? So what if you enjoy clubbing literal 8 year olds in bed wars? How is that any of his business? You don't get to tell him who to date, so why does he get to tell you what games you get to play? Taking away the pc is also ridiculous; you're not a kid who needs to get your iPad taken away when you misbehave. Try to have a talk with him about it---tell him that the game is for everyone to enjoy, you bought the game yourself, and you can be trusted to make sensible decisions as a 15-year-old.",

I have friends that have kids that are younger than you did they start talking about Minecraft and I can keep a conversation with them and my friends just look at me like what the just happened. We actually had a long funny conversation about yep I'm going to send him your way when he has questions about this cuz I don't understand any of it.",
