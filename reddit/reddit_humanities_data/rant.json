Like, who told them? I'm Asian, and I've never seen people think that where I come from. Everyone just knows. And here I'm fucking sick of the same question and having to tell almost every single customer that no, they can still use their phones without a sim card; they just can't use data or make calls but can connect to wifi. And everyone is as surprised as ever. it is fucking ridiculous how do you not know this? Who told you that? is this some kind of generational insight that's passed down to everyone, or what?\n\nEdit: people missed the point. Its not about what you deem usable but people believing their phone will power off without a sim card and not turning on until a simcard is inserted.",

I have no friends also, so I\u2019m alone.  \n\nMy dad who never shows me affection brought me roses today I didn\u2019t want them that\u2019s weird to me. And the only neutral thing my mom asked me today was how it feels to be 20 then ignored me.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t that big of a deal I guess. But I\u2019m the type to always make sure other peoples celebrations are amazing but never have I received one that was considerate or without arguments. \n\nIn the future I don\u2019t want to celebrate it anymore I\u2019m done with birthdays.
