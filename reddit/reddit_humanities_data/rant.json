        "content": "I'm a male btw. I feel like this isn't an unpopular opinion, but I still see a lot of young guys (I assume most of them to be between the ages of 14-18) that genuinely take Andrew Tate and other Alpha male podcasters as a role model.\n\nAnd admittedly, as for Andrew Tate, he seems to be a pretty smart guy, who has always exploited the weaknesses in human psychology to acquire wealth. BUT, he is not a good role model. He's a liar, a hypocrite and doesn't give two fcks about you. He has made the majority of his wealth luring young girls into doing sex work for him and scamming desperate, lonely men off their money. After doing that, he became famous on social media by being controversial to then manipulate young, depressed guys by showing them what they don't have and selling them the dream of wealth and women to those same guys he used to scam to acquire his wealth in the first place. So, he is \"helping\" the same people he used to literally lie to, deceive and scam. And he's \"helping\" them by selling a completely overpriced course with low end side hustles, that won't get the majority of the people who buy that course anywhere. He shames women and porn stars for being promiscuous, yet he made the majority of his wealth with those same women. So, he made his wealth with scummy businesses, NOT by investing in crypto, or doing copywriting, or drop shipping or any of that stuff. You will not acquire his wealth by buying his courses. If you want to do these side hustles, go to YouTube and you will literally find all the information you need for free. Also, the matrix thing he talks about is obviously bs. It is no secret that we are being manipulated by social media and big companies into buying their products, but you will not escape \"the matrix\". Escaping the matrix, if you observe Tates life, is really just becoming as materialistic and hedonistic as possible and not being held accountable for your actions. That's why Andrew Tate said \"the Matrix is attacking me\" after he was arrested. In reality, he was just being held accountable for all the bs he has done over the years. Even if he is innocent, he is still not a good human being.\n\nAs for the other Online Alpha males: Fresh and Fit, Jay Waller, Whatever podcast and so many more. They are literally making their fan boys professional victims, that feel like they are entitled to sex and attention from women. Especially the podcasts just sell this absolutely pathetic incel narrative: \"Mens lives are so hard, they take on the hard jobs in society\", \"you need to be 6ft, make 6 figures or otherwise no woman will want you\" and so on and so on. They complain about mens lives being hard while sitting in a frickin' podcast room and literally just making the woman they invite - many of them onlyfans models and porn stars - look as stupid and uneducated as possible and act as if they represent the average woman. Everyone goes through hard times, not only men. Also this \"high value man\", \"high value woman\", \"sexual market value\" talk... How can any one take this bs seriously?\n\nSeriously guys, I used to listen to Andrew Tate and other Alpha males and their advice made me absolutely miserable. Some advice they give is obviously pretty decent, like: Go to the gym, work as hard as possible, be disciplined etc. etc. But other than that, please don't listen to these guys. They are just trying to sell you a narrative to gain financially. You can be a good man and even make a lot money without being an absolute  jerk. Impressing women with your material wealth and big muscles (not saying big muscles are a bad thing) will not give you a decent partner, it will give you filthy gold diggers, that are not interested in you as a person at all (most of the time). If that's what you want, then that's also fine of course.\n\nForm your own opinions, build a unique personality, be kind, confident, compassionate and humble and do your best in what you're doing. Don't listen to guys online, that don't have your best interest at heart.\n\nI would be interested in hearing other people's thoughts, in case you had the motivation to read this rather long post.",

            "I\u2019m not surprised Andrew Tate and Fresh and Fit got so popular. There will always be people in life that have problems and are looking for solutions. One thing that pushed their popularity is how common it is to shit on normal men on the mainstream media, social media, even Reddit. A lot of men feel lost and useless and a charlatan told these guys he has the solutions to their problems.",
            "I agree completely.\n\n\nI will say, though, that I think that this phenomenon is a symptom of larger problems. The reason that Tate and Waller and their ilk are successful is that young men don't have any masculine role models who talk to them directly about being men. They certainly don't have any who address the insecurities they have about growing up in a rapidly-changing and economically precarious society. They're\u00a0given\u00a0a choice between indifference and a bunch ofwell-intentioned voices telling them all of the many things NOT to do, but not what TO do.\u00a0\n\n\nIn other words, there's a real need there. These charlatans have no problem stepping into that vacuum.",
            "Agree. Equality and inclusion has had an effect also. Obviously it\u2019s not right that Men are in charge of everything and get all the high paid jobs. (It\u2019s gone the right away.) I think social media is to blame primarily. \n\nNo real male role models and people like Tate seem attractive because young men are sick of feeling useless.",
            "He's no alpha sorry.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t say horrible, I think some of them are just completely delusional or just try to sell their audience a narrative. I don\u2019t think they actually believe in the stuff they\u2019re saying. As for Tate and his brother, I guess they come close to horrible, yes.",
            "Absolutely agree. Social media is poison for people and I would say one of the main drivers of insecurity for young people. You gotta have this ass and this waist and this hair and this skin or you gotta be this height and have this jaw line and make this much money etc. etc. The thing that most people don't realise is that this is not reality. These astronomically high standards make them insecure and feel like they are not enough.",
            "Cyzorgg on instagram is great.",
            "Absolutely, like I said in another reply, social media is poison for self esteem. It completely ruins peoples image of reality and sets unrealistic standards that they cannot achieve. That makes them insecure and latch on to people like Tate, who really don't give a shit about them."
