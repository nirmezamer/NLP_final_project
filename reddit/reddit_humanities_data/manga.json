        "content": ">**\\[REPOST NOTE\\]** : The original post was deleted by mods. I asked for specifics to adjust in the future but no reply so far, so automated maybe? Anyway, I think it's because this is very much about ecchi content so I'm reposting with a NSFW tag, and a Spoiler tag too since this is a bit far in the manga. Honestly, I didn't know where the tags were and I didn't think to use them. Too much brain focus on this drivel to think of actually practical things. Let that be a lesson to you, fellow men of culture and nerds/autists of the hyper-focus sort.  \nIf this gets deleted again, well, I dunno what to do next. The thesis(lol) theme is sort of too spicy to be pared down in a way Im satisfied. Eh, oh well.\n\nHardship, Struggle, Desperation, Desire, such things often drive humanity to the brink of destruction, or the peak of evolution. This is the case for many humans, real or fictional, and such is the case even for the eternally THIRSTY women of the 1:39 World where men are rarer than diamonds. Perhaps this applies to these unfortunate souls even more so.\n\nYet Mother Nature/Evolution/God/ess/Chance is not so cruel to these women, and have granted upon their needy ~~wombs~~hearts a power to level the playing field.\n\nThe **Female Aura**. The power of **LUST**\n\n[This is some DBZ bullshit, what the fuck](https://preview.redd.it/25r3fyzcua9d1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5f756a28bf3d0612bea0eefbe44dd818bb1e96f)\n\nOkay, dumbshit fanfics disguising as flowery fancy speeches aside. The manga **A Parallel World With a 1:39 Male to Female Ratio is Unexpectedly Normal** is certainly not a unique premise, nor are Power Systems. Nen, Stands, Hamon, Cursed Energy, Breathing Techniques, power systems are as common as shounen manga, sometimes, even more common. What I aim to achieve in yet another session of deranged, unnecessarily over-thought theory crafting is flesh out the hints of techniques in the 1:39 manga and create a semi-functioning Power System. Now, you may have questions like:\n\n1. What is this 1:39 manga you are talking about?\n2. Is this that self-mastubatory male power fantasy manga?\n3. What techniques are you talking about?\n4. Are you honestly trying to make a shounen power system from the horniness of very down-bad women?\n\n*Yes, yes I am*\n\nWith that out of the way, let us explore the Female Aura. What is the Female Aura?\n\nTo succinct, the Female Aura is the exposure, the leakage, and the representation of the raw, unfiltered, bottomless LUST that lies in the very heart and womb of every woman in that world. The unrestrainable boundless HORNY that powers the inexorable advance of womankind against a gender ratio that by all logic, should have killed all of humanity. A natural evolutionary adaptation in such a dystopian world where men are rarer than diamonds, and good men even less.\n\nFor you see, in a world where by nature, men only compromise 2.5% of all humanity, Mother Nature dictates upon her daughters that only women of LUST may receive the Grail of Life (cum), and those whose fleshly desires are deemed insufficient are condemned to have their genes lost to the sands of time, their genetic future as dry as their womanhood.\n\nHence, the Female Aura was born.\n\nAt first, in the age of Tribe and Stone, the Female Aura is more a display of force and strength, a metaphorical bare of fangs against the endless hordes of horny bitches in heat. To tell them all that YOU, superior woman that you are, are the only one worthy to receive that husbando's baby batter. But as the number and desperation of womenfolk grew, even threats of mutilation and death are not enough to quench the flames of THIRST. So, those with greater Female Auras are now forced to learn to use their Mother Nature given strengths to find a way to keep the genetic line their foremothers worked so hard to maintain intact.\n\nAnd so, the Female Aura evolved, into what we see now.\n\n# FEMALE AURA POWER SYSTEM DETAILS: What is KNOWN\n\nThe Female Aura is not well understood, as it is more an instinctual ability than a formed/trained technique. These are the details we know so far:\n\n* On average, Female Aura instinctually, unconsciously, and sometimes forcibly, boosts the desires and sensitivity of a female to the presence of a suitable male mate, often at the cost of mental capacity. Senses of smell, sight, taste, and even the mystical senses of the womb itself, become heightened to superhuman levels. Caution, fear, trepidation, common sense and general intelligence is removed or suppressed in order for lust, desire and need to come to the forefront.\n   * But this is the basic function, it's roots as an evolutionary adaptation to the 1:39 world. We shall soon see that the Female Aura can do so much more\n\n[\\\\\"So it Begins\\\\\" - Theoden King](https://preview.redd.it/fyx6ya24z99d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09ad5fbbee8594be30d3cbabc949f78a96ddc30)\n\n* Female Aura is present in almost all women. Such is this commonality that even suppression of Female Aura is a rare trait. And the complete absence of the Female Aura, like that of Hinata, is seen as an oddity of the highest order\n\n[Hinata, my beloved, the Anomaly](https://preview.redd.it/0tjfrdt9z99d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=386467834267eb4e28a96b47c837a486a519ed35)\n\n* Female Aura starts first as \"Female Instinct\", the guiding hand and chain that forces all women to THIRST the way they do\n\n[Sumire Nearly Overwhelmed by her Female Instinct](https://preview.redd.it/j1iqh9vdz99d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88683b3c040bb4ec0bca3b42ca0016d39a855a0)\n\n* The full name of Female Aura is **\\[Female in Heat Aura\\]** (*Female Sexual Desire*), clearly showing the origin and root of this mysterious power.\n\n[Note: Certain Capable Females\\(Sumire\\) can Detect Female Auras](https://preview.redd.it/0dl6f47mz99d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d629a21a05f80fc302d119644a20180b18b10dd4)\n\n* As Female Aura is an instinctual based ability, special circumstances can boost Female Aura even more than conventional Power Systems. On rare occasions, it can be boosted past it's theoretical limits. Note however, that Misaki-chan's Aura boost is because of the otherworlder Satou Sou, Climaxxer of Women, Lord Chad of Coping Denseness. Consider such power-ups as exceptions, not the rule.\n\n[Misaki Overwhelming: Female Aura Exceeding Normal Thresholds](https://preview.redd.it/nke44ijmz99d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1d58979fc5e7ead544550598f327483fa74fbf)\n\n# EROTES TECHNIQUES: CRYSTALLIZATION OF FEMALE AURAS\n\n***^(\\[WARNING: DUMBASS FANFIC SHOUNEN BULLSHIT INCOMING\\])***\n\n>In Ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Erotes are a collective of winged gods associated with love and sexual intercourse.\n\nThough Female Auras served well as symbols of strength and female fertility, such things are simply not enough to dissuade thousands of years of genetic female desperation. And necessity has ever been the mother of invention.\n\nIn the manga of 1:39, we have seen only one example of the Female Auras latest step in evolution, that being Chabatake Miku's **\\[FAKE LOVER'S BOAST\\]** *(Deception Memory).*\n\n[The First Example of EROTES: True Female Aura](https://preview.redd.it/smsl09hb1a9d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe9ab613e5982a8e5be7c888f8eba784762281c)\n\nFor simplicities sake, I have taken to calling these crystallizations of raw Female Aura, the ***Erotes Techniques***, or Erotes for short. Shounen Power Systems require short, concise, catchy names after all.\n\nLet us delve deeper into Chabatake Miku's Erotes.\n\nChabatake Miku Erotes: **\\[FAKE LOVER'S BOAST\\]**\n\nMiku's Erotes is born of needs, the need for maintaining discipline versus the need of her womb. To maintain her status, her skill, her chance with Satou Sou, and her mind, her Erotes manifested in a way that not only stabilizes her sanity *(sort of)(not really)(close enough)*, but boosts her will and desires for Sou. You may think the methods are twisted, but Mother Nature cares not about the contrivances of mortals, Her only care is that the babies flow.\n\n\\[Fake Lover's Boast\\] has 2 notable abilities:\n\n* *(Deception Memory)* - allows Miku to seamlessly and unconsciously manifest self-illusions and delusions to help her lust-addled mind. These range from auditory hallucinations to full-on False Memories, cleanly inserted into her mind to allow her to continue functioning in spite of emotional damage that would normally send the average woman into depression. The warmth of love can be provided instantly, without the need of Sou's presence, for Sou is always with her.\n* *(Scent of Happiness)* - enhances Miku's sense of smell to ludicrous levels, rivaling that of blood hounds. Even a full bath did not stop her from smelling Sou's wet dream discharge. The Scent of Sou also boosts her morale and will, even from near zero. Even at her lowest, all she needs is a whiff of Sou, and she's back to full strength\n\nThere are however, downsides to her Erotes, like any good Power System\n\n[Great Power always comes with Great Costs](https://preview.redd.it/y9g7x4nu7a9d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0ac10c786f8bf5e46330cf2c4821556f81b4ce0)\n\n*(Deception Memory)* makes Miku extremely prone to bouts of self-induced delusional fantasies. If unprepared, she can become lost in these false memories for some time. *(Deception Memory)* is also unconscious, making it so that it WILL edit her mind and memories whenever and wherever. No core memory is safe, if it means coming closer to making Sou cum close in her.\n\n*(Scent of Happiness)* comes with a severe downside of making Miku a neurochemical addict to the serotonin boost of Sou's Scent. Without a strong will and proper preparation, Sou Scent Withdrawal Symptoms can effectively render Miku a sexual zombie, eroding her vaunted mind and skills all for a touch of Sou's Masculinity.\n\n# NO COST TOO GREAT: THE ZERO-SUM GAME OF FEMALE AURAS\n\nMiku Erotes **\\[FAKE LOVER'S BOAST\\]** shows the hidden brutal truth of a 1:39 world; when finding the love of your life is closer to winning the lottery than a coin toss, almost everything and anything is on the table. It matters not if Miku becomes scent-addict madwoman, memory and mind a patchwork of truths and falsehoods. All that matters is finding her Sou. Because effectively, her body knows Sou is 1 in a billion chance. Let this chance go, and forever regret in her soul that she let go of the keys to Heaven itself.\n\n# MORE FANFIC: POTENTIAL EROTES TECHNIQUES OF OTHER GIRLS\n\nTo keep this already long drivel even longer, let's go on a quick (*this a lie*) theory crafting bend on what Aura Techniques the other girls could manifest\n\nMisaki Erotes : **\\[EROTES EXPANSION: CUPIO ERGO SUM\\]**\n\n* Misaki is a bit of a special case. Exposed to the blinding light of Sou's **\\[Atomic Smile\\]**, her Female Aura was boosted beyond what is normal even for the ever-thirsty needs of \"normal\" women. Breaking her mind and turning her into even more of a pig in heat than what is considered conventional, her Erotes evolved into a strange form.\n\n>Once, Misaki knew the truth. The internet told her that real men are not as good as 2d men. That these girls thirsting over flawed men are wrong.\n\n>She was proven wrong, by the presence of Sou\n\n>Then, Misaki knew the truth. That real men existed, and some of them can be better than 2d. The proof is right in front of her.\n\n>Then the proof smiled, and she was proven wrong.\n\n>Now, she knows the TRUTH. That real men, 2d men, all these \"men\" are falsehoods. Only Sou is the One True Man. Sou is the Light, Sou is the Truth. Thusly, her Lust to Him is more than True. It is the Stairway to Heaven itself.\n\n>She Lusts, therefore She IS.\n\n* **\\[EROTES EXPANSION: CUPIO ERGO SUM\\]** makes it so that Misaki becomes utterly unshakable in her desire for Sou. No Erotes, no Fate, no change nor chance can shake the Truth burned into her eyes when the Sou smiled upon her. In the indeterminate time it takes for the Erotes Expansion to last, Misaki cannot be broken, she is effectively invincible.\n\nSumire Erotes : **\\[GAZE OF TRUE LUST\\]** *(Vigilant Onee-chan)*\n\n* PROS: Sumire's natural ability to immediately measure the Female Aura of another pig in heat and her instincts that can discern the dangers of a woman to her Sou is enhanced to a full Erotes. Now she no longer needs her eyes to see whether a dangerous pig is nearing Sou. A new, paranatural sense more precise than radar is now accessible to Sumire, allowing her to instinctually know where Sou is at all times, and the Female Auras and Erotes of all women in Sou's vicinity.\n* CONS: This is not passive, and is extremely taxing on Sumire, not only mentally, but physically and paranaturaly as well. Her Older Sister value to Sou, already low, drops ever further if she overstrains the \\[Gaze\\]\n\nSakura Erotes : **\\[ANGEL'S FALL\\]** *(Mask of the Little Sister)*\n\n* PROS: \\[Angel's Fall\\] removes all of Sakura's mental limiters, both intellectual and emotional. Becoming a Yandere rivaling a harem manga demon queen, she becomes a genius, cold, calculating and manipulative little sister, cleverly hiding her moves and intentions behind the veil of a cute, innocent imouto. All to finally acquire the love of her Onii-chan, and receive the greatest affirmation of all, his child in her belly\n* CONS: \\[Angel's Fall\\] only triggers in times of extreme threat, stress and duress, turning Sakura into a girl not fully her. But the greatest danger is that if Sou ever finds out about the true nature of Fallen Angel Sakura, he will fear her. And this will break Sakura's heart.\n\nAkane Erotes : **\\[MILK OF MOTHER'S LOVE\\]** *(Homing Instinct)*\n\n* PROS: Finally learning the power of the biggest breasts in the series, Akane fully leans into Sou's big boobs fetish, and her sexual allure to Sou skyrockets. Forgoing all restraints that previously held her back, she becomes the Succubus Queen of House Satou. Sou will need extreme will, cope and even more comedy protag plot armor to stop himself from supping upon the Milk of Mother's Kindness.\n* CONS: Her sexual power boost is not a guaranteed win, and if Sou successfully resists, he may be scarred of what his Mother attempted upon him, breaking Akane's heart. The mental unshackling will also make her dismissive, if not outright hostile, to her 2 daughters. After the boost, she will regret the sins she inflicted upon her children\n\nKaede Erotes : **\\[LUST TEMPO ADVANTAGE\\]** *(Heart of a Woman's Cards)*\n\n* PROS: Kaede's intellectual skills are sharpened to an otherworldly degree. She gains intimate understanding of language, rules, and associated trivia necessary to twist and manipulate the words of those around her for her benefit. Rules-Lawyering and Word-Manipulation of the finest degree are at her fingertips, and Sou will find that he is be buried in a 69-page legally binding contract that consigns all future semen to Kaede\n* CONS: Kaede's Erotes forsakes all moral and ethical restrictions to achieve true manipulation. By instinct, most people will find Kaede Erotes as deplorable, alienating her from even Sou. She must rely solely of \\[Lust Tempo Advantage\\] to keep the pressure up, or lose the entire game.\n\nKanaria Erotes : **\\[FORBIDDEN GOLDEN PATH\\]** *(Descent into Depravity)*\n\n* PROS: A near memetic ability that not only un-restrains Kanaria's unique imagination, but also spreads the allure of her sexual excesses to all that hear her. Like a Slaaneshi daemonette, she whispers to Sou and her friends secrets and activities so inspired, depraved and hedonistic it both horrifies and intrigues. Soon, Sou and all girls near him fall to Kanaria's Golden Path to hedonistic hell, with God-Empress Kanaria taking her rightful place as the Queen of Sou's Eternal Harem Orgy\n* CONS: She becomes a Slaaneshi demon in all but name. Without constant mental control and will, she will swiftly fall into an inescapable spiral into depraved destruction.\n\nHINATA EROTES : {\u0337R\u0335E\u0335D\u0334A\u0334C\u0334T\u0337E\u0337D\u0335}\u0334 \u0335\\[\u0338R\u0335E\u0337D\u0336A\u0334C\u0338T\u0334E\u0335D\u0337\\]\u0338\n\n\u0336\\[\u0334R\u0334E\u0334D\u0338A\u0338C\u0337T\u0338E\u0338D\u0338\\]\u0334 \u0335\\[\u0338**C\u0334A\u0337N\u0338**\\]\u0334 \u0334\\[\u0336R\u0338E\u0334D\u0335A\u0334C\u0338T\u0334E\u0335D\u0338\\]\u0337 \u0335\\[\u0337R\u0338E\u0338D\u0336A\u0336C\u0335T\u0335E\u0338D\u0334\\]\u0336 \u0337\\[\u0334**Y\u0336O\u0336U\u0336**\\]\u0337 \u0335\\[\u0338R\u0338E\u0337D\u0334A\u0338C\u0335T\u0338E\u0334D\u0336\\]\u0338 \u0335\\[\u0335R\u0336E\u0337D\u0338A\u0336C\u0334T\u0336E\u0337D\u0336\\]\u0337 \u0335\\[\u0338R\u0334E\u0337D\u0338A\u0337C\u0335T\u0335E\u0335D\u0334\\]\u0335 \u0334\\[\u0338**H\u0335E\u0338A\u0337L\u0335**\\]\u0338 \u0337\\[\u0336R\u0334E\u0335D\u0338A\u0335C\u0338T\u0334E\u0335D\u0335\\]\u0338 \u0335\\[\u0338R\u0338E\u0338D\u0334A\u0337C\u0335T\u0334E\u0338D\u0336\\]\u0337 \u0336\\[\u0336R\u0338E\u0336D\u0335A\u0337C\u0334T\u0338E\u0334D\u0337\\]\u0338 \u0338\\[\u0338**H\u0335E\u0336R\u0336**\\]\u0334 \u0336\\[\u0336R\u0337E\u0336D\u0334A\u0335C\u0334T\u0336E\u0335D\u0335\\]\u0334 \u0338\\[\u0334R\u0336E\u0335D\u0334A\u0336C\u0337T\u0336E\u0337D\u0335\\]\u0334 \u0337\\[\u0335**B\u0336E\u0334F\u0334O\u0337R\u0336E\u0338**\\]\u0337 \u0336\\[\u0336R\u0336E\u0334D\u0337A\u0334C\u0336T\u0338E\u0338D\u0336\\]\u0338 \u0335\\[\u0334R\u0337E\u0334D\u0334A\u0336C\u0338T\u0337E\u0335D\u0336\\]\u0336 \u0336\\[\u0338R\u0335E\u0338D\u0338A\u0337C\u0337T\u0338E\u0336D\u0338\\]\u0338 \u0337\\[\u0336R\u0336E\u0334D\u0337A\u0335C\u0334T\u0334E\u0337D\u0336\\]\u0335 \u0337\\[\u0335**I\u0334T\u0334**\\]\u0337 \u0335\\[\u0334**I\u0337S\u0338**\\]\u0338 \u0338\\[\u0338**T\u0335O\u0338O\u0334**\\]\u0335 \u0336\\[\u0335**L\u0334A\u0334T\u0338E\u0336**\\]\u0334\n\n**\\[SPECIAL CASE\\] : SATOU SOU - OTHERWORLDER**\n\nAs befit of his status as isekai protag, Sou comes with natural abilities that can be described only as \"hilarious hacks\". As someone from a world of 50:50 gender ratio, Satou Sou is immune to the evolutionary adaptations his male body possesses in the 1:39 world as survival mechanism against thirsty women; fear of women and womanly attributes, social coping mechanism like anger and superiority complexes, increased predilection to homosexuality, weaker and less sexually inviting bodies to dissuade would-be female rapists.\n\nHis testosterone levels, his sexual desires, his taste in women, and his mannerisms, normal in our world, has turned him into the Anomalocaris of this world. The only Apex Predator in a Sea of Prey(*women, and potentially some gay men*). A lesson in invasive foreign species placed in an unprepared ecosystem. Yet, Satou Sou holds the power to both destroy their society, or dominate it and rebuild it in his image.\n\nHis abilities so far are:\n\n**\\[BIG BROTHER'S AFFIRMATION\\]** *(Mind Breaking Praise)*\n\n* a praising technique honed and trained by his bias to finally having a little sister to dote on with Sakura. His ability to praise a woman unflinchingly despite the embarrassment is enough to crack the hearts of even man-hating lesbians, and utterly mind-breaks the conventional female\n\n**\\[PLAYBOY JOY\\]** *(The Pleasure of Playing with Hearts)*\n\n* a curious mental tick that transforms Sou into a playful playboy that can swoon those vulnerable to the \"bad boy\" fetish. Seemingly only appears when there's either; Yuri-afficionados or bratty girls. Possibly stems from his seeming fetish for Yuri-Corruption\n\n**\\[ATOMIC SMILE\\]** *(Light of the Perfect Man)*\n\n* Sou smiles with joy and gratefulness pure and true. The transmission of such pureness and manliness becomes a supernatural flood of metaphorical light that burns the hearts and wombs of all girls that beholds it. One requires an iron will, or a depressed heart, to resist orgasming on the spot.\n\n**\\[LUST CONVERSION: MUSCLES\\]** *(Distraction from the Urge)*\n\n* Sou converts excess lust into muscle growth through exercise. Sou's physical exercises builds his physique faster and better than the average male in the 1:39 world. His sexual and physical appeal increases over time, and there is no end yet in sight to this growth.\n\n**\\[ARTIFICIAL DENSENESS\\]** *(Hunger for Normalcy)*\n\n* Sou is an orphan in his old world. So when he arrived in a world where finally has family, his greatest desire is to keep this happiness. But his mother and sisters desires not familial love, but romantic and sexual love. So, Sou's mind can continually keep him supplied with custom-made copium so he remains dense to the obvious advances. As such, blissful ignorance is maintained, and Sou remains happy, **for now**.\n* This is slowly eroding away\n\n**\\[VIRILITY OF THE KHAN\\]** *(Stamina and Strength Eternal)*\n\n* *{WARNING: PARALLEL-REALITY BULLSHITERY DETECTED}{R18 RESTRAINTS LIFTED}* Limited to the version of Sou that embraces the advances of the women, Sou gains superhuman stamina, strength and hyper-shortened refractory\u00a0period. He becomes the Hentai Protagonist he was meant to be.\n\n>*\"Beds shall be broken, wombs shall be shaken. My Sword's night, a long night, till the Sun rises\"*\n\n>- Satou Sou Khan embracing the fate thrust upon him\n\n*Final Addendum:*\n\nSo ends yet another massive, unnecessary, insane and excessively over-thought spiel on a frankly pointless topic on a comedy ecchi manga. But it was fun, so who cares. Did you like my newest Ted Talk? No? Too bad, too late. I can't rewind the time you spent reading my freshest mind-vomit, and neither can you.",

These titles alone elevate the Satou to the Celestial Cumtivation Realm 3rd layer, and shows in relation to the women that surround him how they and the world will be breaking the normal powers calling in the coming chapters.\n\n Additionally, women in this world appear to engage \"Breastling\" as a low stakes way of asserting dominance in defense of their males. Thus we see that the lustful aura appears only in that of extreme distress, which makes sense due to the ridiculous natural strength of the FMCs of the series in addition to the boost which Satou brings to the imbalance of the world's natural order.",
