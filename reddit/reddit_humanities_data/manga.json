            "Toshokan No Daimajutsushi\nIt's the best read I had this year, and I don't say it lightly. It's a fantasy world following a kid who wants to be a librarian. I can't do it justice by describing it, so I will say that it's well written, the world building is great, it's nothing like your isekai trope. The more you read the more you discover the world, societies, the lore, the problems that will rise in the next chapters. It would do a great adaptation in anime",
            "I finished <Non Non Biyori>! It's a cute series. I think the Renge chapters and the Natsumi chapters were my favourite, Renge because she was such a goofy kid (and later on attempted to be an older sister figure, which shook things up a bit) and Natsumi because she was such a screw-up lmao. I didn't particularly love the series, i don't think it stands up above the other slice of life type stuff, but it was a good read-through.",
            "**My Wandering Warrior Eating Disorder** aka **<Meisou Senshi Nagata Kabi: Gourmet de Go!>**\n\n\nIn this part of the gripping autobiographical graphic novel saga by Nagata Kabi (*<My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness>*,*<My Alcoholic Escape from Reality>*, etc. etc.) it goes into more detail of, well, if the english title isn't a dead giveaway, her eating disorder issues that coincided with/stemmed from the rest of her psychological and depressive issues that she went on at length about in her previous books. This one is much much shorter than the other entries though. But still, if you've read and like me have been impressed by her works thus far this entry is here to read as well.\n\n\n**<Skeleton Double>**\n\n\nI liked this. I really did. Interesting base for the use of powers in this story. The Cypress lady was great. And once they characterized the MC he got interesting. But oddly, beyond a lot of those surface level thoughts on this one, I don't really have anything more succinct to say about it. Though the rushed final conflict with all the potential story elements crammed in there at the end on top of the overall feel at the end probably didn't help in that regard.\n\n\nIt didn't really do anything wrong in it's execution, and like I said I enjoyed it. I just find myself without much to say about it beyond, \"well that was cool\" a lot of the time.\n\n\n\n**<Daddy and Buddy>**\n\n\nWell this sucks Beavis, another decent series came to a sudden end. Not that I couldn't foresee this series being one of those cases from the get go but still.\n\n\n\nWell in any case. The mature emotional throughline of this series really gave this one it's chops.\n\n\n**<Dear Anemone>**\n\n\nAnd this one didn't last long now did it. Not that I was expecting this poor mans version of *<Jigokuraku>* to anyways. And it went out on a very cheesy note.\n\n\n\n\nWell, the artwork certainly did it's job though here can't deny that. Got some mild enjoyment out of reading it. But it will ultimately not be missed.\n\n\n\n**<Futari no Lion>** aka **The Two Lions**\n\n\nIt was short and there and I was bored with no better ideas for things to read so whatevs.\n\n\n**<Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Comic Anthology>**\n\n\nDamn was I bored as fuck with no better ideas for something to fill an hour with enough to read this...",
            "Yakuza Reincarnated, it had a good premise but I am still checking if it does wonders. Hopefully it doesn't turn into a shitshow that is Re:Monster",
            "Caught up to <Bokura No Kiseki> literally one of my best reads of all time. Why is this manga is underrated? A large cast who is so, so wel written, an amazing plot with rich lore and amazing plot twists? It's an amazing series.",
            "Started <The Apothecary Diaries> and caught up with <Blue Lock>.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Apothecary is pretty fun, and I adore Maomao for her little cat appearances and the way she's just so unphased by Jinshi sometimes. Also, her inner gremlin coming out when medicine is involved, very cute. The mysteries are pretty intriguing, quite like how some (maybe all, I have bad memory) cases have little hints that relate to the answer Maomao comes up with. For example, >!when the woman woke up before the dude she poisoned, without much help, which did play into what Maomao came up with as a solution!< while she was visiting her home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nQuite good overall, and the art is great. I'm only on Chapter 35.1 though, haven't caught up yet. I'm mostly curious if Maomao is gonna take any major losses by drawing a wrong conclusion during a case in the remaining chapters, I think it would be a good shake up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Onto Blue Lock, I really enjoyed the U-20 game. Isagi's goal at the end actually made me yell. On the other hand, my eyebrows were raising reading just about everything Shidou said during the match.\u00a0\n\n\nThis whole arc was just plain awesome and chaotic: Rin going boogeyman mode, Shidou, the Itoshis, Ego actually showing a hint of happiness for once, Aiku, \"Make us win, you shitty four eyes\", Reo and Nagi actually working well together after a while, Nagi's fist pump, and Isagi's puzzle coming all together with the \"luck\" piece.\u00a0\n\n\nThe 2 follow up SoL chapters were a great break from all that, pretty cute and chill.\n\n\nThe current training/selection games(?) with the top players have been good so far. I do think they're a little worse than U-20 quality wise since it's been >!Isagi brainblast sweep moreso than usual, and Bastard beating Ubers and Manshine felt a little bleh IMO.!< I do appreciate how some underutilized dudes got some screentime though, namely Raichi and Hiori. Also Kurona, kind of, but so far he seems like a bit of a pass bot.\n\n\nOn the flip side, Kaiser has also been jobbing as a \"rival\" compared to Rin tbh. He was annoyingly good at first, but now that everyone is getting awesome moments and >!Isagi has been out smarting him most of the time,!< he kinda sucks. Sure he'll >!probably score the next goal, but I don't like him enough to get hyped.!<\n\n\nTo finish on a more postive note though, I've been loving the character interactions this whole arc. Reo and Nagi >!getting back together for an awesome stars aligned move!<, Charles and Shidou >!instantly becoming besties!<, Reo and Isagi just generally being friendly compared to \"What the fuck is this guy talking about\" two arcs ago, and the top players continuously making fun of Noa only for him to \"\ud83d\uddff\". Also, I laughed extremely hard at >!Rin and Kaiser breaking down after Isagi scored in the PXG match.!<",
            "I recently caught up on a few manga I stopped reading a while ago, or even years ago in tha case of <Kaiju No. 8> and <Spy x Family>.\n\nI got lucky with my timing. Kaiju No. 8's latest chapter is the climax of a long arc. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I was reading the chapters as they came out, but I think the pacing is good if you read it in one go.\n\nSpy x Family doesn't have any arcs that long but still had some very tense moments. I am glad I didn't have to wait two weeks after every chapter to see how >!school bus hijacking!< would end.\n\nI also caught up with <Oshi no ko> and <The classroom of a black cat and a witch>\n\nOshi no ko is entering the last arc and I am curious to see how the antagonist is going to react to what Aqua has been doing.\n\nClassroom also just finished a major arc with >!Spica finally getting her first win against Aria!<. Followed by some good chapters deepening Spica's relationship with Claude, and a chapter in which a major character >!licks their own but.!< That last one made my laugh out loud several times and made me remember why I loved this manga in the first place. Definitely planning to keep up with this one again going forward.",

            "Hey! I need a favor. What\u2019s the name of the manga with the little orange dragon that rides on a roomba? There\u2019s a little purple dragon as well. They both serve a guy in a modern day hunters thing with gates and all that. Also, I was hoping to find this manga where the guy gets reincarnated as a side character, in a modern day hunters/guild/gate type thing. He also has a skill that makes him stronger the more famous he is. He was known for being ungrateful and bad, but now is a good guy. If anyone can help I appreciate it!",
