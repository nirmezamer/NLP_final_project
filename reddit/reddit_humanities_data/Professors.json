So use them, ignore them, or  start you own What the Fuck Wednesday counter thread.\n\nThe theme of today\u2019s thread is to share good things in your life or  career. They can be small one offs, they can be good interactions with  students, a new heartwarming initiative you\u2019ve started, or anything else  you think fits. I have no plans to tone police, so don\u2019t overthink your  additions. Let the wholesome family fun begin!",

            "I teach at a cc with cohorts. The cohort that just graduated hated me for some reason. It was my first year teaching and I guess they were bitter that I replaced a teacher they liked (he left on his own accord, but they don\u2019t realize this I guess. He was also easy AF and never challenged them). They\u2019ve now graduated, passed their registry (apparently no thanks to me) and some are at the clinical sites that our current students go to. \n\nI had one of our current students tell me someone from last year spent the whole day talking trash about me, and our program in general. The current student basically told this person to stfu, and that they were being a brat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her problem was; we all know how much work you guys do and how much you care.\u201d",

It's a course I invented and care a lot about, but was a bit hesitant into giving the course again since it is an enormous amount of work and they did not seem all that engaged.\n\n\nThe report cards were very positive. Including the feedback received by the emeritus.\n\n\nOne extra student, that was only visiting and did not need the credits but insisted taking this class wrote me a letter and gave me a present.\u00a0The letter was very sweet, said that my course has shown them what research should strive towards.\n\n\nMaybe it is not such a waste of time...",

            "Just wrapped up an accelerated online survey course, and they've moved most of my teaching load online because $$$. Really starting to look like my career going forward is going to be interacting with AI chatbots. The lowest grades I've ever given in 20 years, mostly for ChatGPT. Emails, essays, posts, nearly all of it was AI. And I'm doing all the best practice stuff so these aren't even questions that can be answered by AI. But they don't care. I even had to give a bunch of zeros on self-reflection assignments that they get points just for doing. Cheating is literally the only way to get a zero and yet the class averaged 35%. The final essays (essays are required to be assigned for this course) were even worse. Only two writing assignments the whole class had an average grade above passing. And again, I have to give writing assignments for this class, so not like I can give other kinds of work.\n\nI hate it so, so much and it depresses the hell out of me. I've loved this career and I was pretty good at it, but this shit is really making me question if I want to do this for another two decades.\n\nFuck this! Happy Friday, y'all. \ud83d\ude43",
