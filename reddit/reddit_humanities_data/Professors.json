Continuing this week we  will have Wholesome Wednesdays, Fuck this Fridays, and (small) Success  Sundays.\n\nAs has been mentioned, these should be considered additions to the  regular discussions, not replacements. So use them, ignore them, or  start you own What the Fuck Wednesday counter thread.\n\nThe theme of today\u2019s thread is to share good things in your life or  career. They can be small one offs, they can be good interactions with  students, a new heartwarming initiative you\u2019ve started, or anything else  you think fits. I have no plans to tone police, so don\u2019t overthink your  additions. Let the wholesome family fun begin!",

            "I teach at a cc with cohorts. The cohort that just graduated hated me for some reason. It was my first year teaching and I guess they were bitter that I replaced a teacher they liked (he left on his own accord, but they don\u2019t realize this I guess. He was also easy AF and never challenged them). They\u2019ve now graduated, passed their registry (apparently no thanks to me) and some are at the clinical sites that our current students go to. \n\nI had one of our current students tell me someone from last year spent the whole day talking trash about me, and our program in general. The current student basically told this person to stfu, and that they were being a brat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her problem was; we all know how much work you guys do and how much you care.\u201d",

            "I finished an advanced course for PhD students. I had only 5 students + one old emeritus that would come all the time. It's a course I invented and care a lot about, but was a bit hesitant into giving the course again since it is an enormous amount of work and they did not seem all that engaged.\n\n\nThe report cards were very positive. Including the feedback received by the emeritus.\n\n\nOne extra student, that was only visiting and did not need the credits but insisted taking this class wrote me a letter and gave me a present.\u00a0The letter was very sweet, said that my course has shown them what research should strive towards.\n\n\nMaybe it is not such a waste of time...",

            "I don\u2019t think there was a period of my life (after my undergrad) when I felt as unproductive, distracted, stressed and miserable as the months last year in between the last in person interview and an offer. I just felt like throwing up all the time.",

            "Being on the other side now, it is easy to see how things drag on. We did a search this past year and were relatively on top of getting people in after the close of the application window and ranking the candidates, but then the chair was out of town for a week and for some reason didn't pass the name along to the dean until after they were back, then we found out our top candidate was going to ask for a spousal hire but the spouse was unavailable to come interview for a few more weeks (plus time for approval of a spousal hire to go up and down the admin chain), then there was the normal back and forth on startup things for both of them after we and the admin had approved the spousal hire, etc. So a search for which we did interviews in March wasn't really finalized with other candidates notified that they weren't getting the job until mid-June, and with the exception of a few minor slip-ups here and there, it wasn't really anyone's fault other than there are a lot of steps and a lot of complications can easily pop up.",
            "Totally! I had a campus visit in March and they told me they didn't have a timeline. Thankfully, my more recent campus visit gave me a timeline, so I can just wait until that deadline and not constantly wonder if/when I'll hear back.",
            "I feel this.\n\nSometimes, you hear back and it makes even less sense. I applied for a 4-3 teaching VAP at a SLAC. This week, I got an email that the position was eliminated. Searching for a teaching VAP this late usually means you already have the class schedule set with students enrolled that needs to be taught, not something you can just eliminate.",
