        "content": "Every sub-reddit has a focus - it's raison d'etre *(reason for existence).*  **Because** if you don't focus, people stop participating because it has just become one big mess of topics.\n\nOurs focus is ... education, discussion, and sharing of entry and mid level separate & multi component audio systems.   **Generally speaking, that is 2 channel stereo systems** assembled for music listening - things that are both \"budget\" and \"audiophile\". So being budget is not enough, nor is being \"audiophile\". Generally speaking, **UNDER** $1,000 spent per component is our threshold, although obviously that number will vary by the person.   Budget for me was $50 (all in) at one time.  Now I am fortunate that if I want to, I don't mind spending $500 a piece.  Others can go more - good for them.   \n Try [r/audiophile](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/) if your spending more than $1,000 per componant.\n\nOf course, many of us use our music listening set ups for multiple purposes - so 2.1 (adding a subwoofer), 3.0 (L/R with a center channel), 5.1 (surround) and up are also fair game.  But the fundamental goal of this reddit is better 2 channel and 2.1 systems to play music - as good as we can afford.\n\nWhat we are not is ***soundbars, boomboxes, bluetooth speakers PC branded audio solutions.*** Those things have their place, but it's not our reason to exist. As for just the soundbar aspect that belongs at  [r/soundbars](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundbars/)\n\nIn addition, **we are not about IEM's or Headphones** (try [r/headphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/) or [r/HeadphoneAdvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/)). That is their reason for existence. Yes, they can be budget audiophile, but again, it's not our focus.\n\nWhile part of \"budget audiophile\", for more detail, try [r/turntables](https://www.reddit.com/r/turntables), [r/vinyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/), and [r/hometheater](https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/) for questions specific to them. There will be a better chance of a more educated response there to those issues. Those questions are welcome here, but probably better there once you get past \"budget\". Questions on Vintage equipment? [r/vintageaudio](https://www.reddit.com/r/vintageaudio/) is the place for you to get better advice (likely)\n\nDIY is also part of \"budget audiophile\", but [r/diyaudio/](https://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/) and [r/diysound](https://www.reddit.com/r/diysound/) focuses a lot more heavily on that issue.\n\nSo to reiterate, we don't hate headphones, logitech, or soundbars, etc. But those questions don't belong here and your post may well be deleted or closed. Because those are not the issues we have chosen in BudgetAudiophile to make part of this sub-reddit. You may not agree, but that is what it is.\n\nWho is this \"we\" I speak of?

The caps are more of a maintenance thing but a bad board would be trouble. These provide a wonderful robust sound but it is old. Your biggest risk is the slippery slope into audio ridiculousness. You are about to take the first step, the same one I took 20+ years ago.",

            "That is NOT a Classic 3020 of legend.  This model came from a successor line several years later.  Smaller buttons, and I bet it doesnt have the horizontal Jack pack on the rear apron.  Not at all bad, but not the one you think."

            "That's not an electrostat, it's a planar magnetic. Magnepans are really great but they require some high current / big amps as they produce a impedance load that can be 'unfriendly\" to some smaller amps.  Also, don't expect big cabinet speaker low bass or large scale dynamics.  If you have a subwoofer, this won't be a big problem.  Also, place them well away from the back walls and side walls the best you can and if set up properly, they can be freaking great!",
            "I have Magnepan speakers and will highly recommend them. Incredible clarity and soundstage. Buy them, you will not regret it. Mine I got used off eBay a long time ago and it was my best buy ever.   \nYes you could get a subwoofer and I myself may one day pair these with a subwoofer. I use a vintage Onkyo Integra A-9911 amp that can deliver 90 Watts to 8 Ohm speakers and 160 Watts to 4 Ohm speakers. The Magnepan are 4 Ohm so there is enough power. But still I only turn up the volume to 11 o'clock and that's really extremely loud already. So I never have to go past that. That's why I believe that even a 60 Watts 8 Ohm amp would do just as well as it will put out much more wattage into 4 Ohms, like around 120 Watts and that should be sufficient.",
            "You either like them or you dont.   I am in the dont camp",
            "Planar magnetics offer a level of transparency, speed that conventional cone drivers can only dream about. However, they are quite inefficient and need a high current amp to sound best.\n\nShould match these type of speakers to a high quality source.",
            "Hell yea!   I sold my maggies and fully regret that decision.  They do need a good quality amp",
            "If they work they are considered great speakers but I think they need a dedicated subwoofer for the low end. I've always wanted to listen to some.",
            "I have a set. I have an active crossover and subs to handle the bottom 200Hz. Very small sweet spot. I use a Quad 909 to power them.\n\nEdit - forgot to say how fantastic they are.",
            "They are the Ferrari (or Lambo if that's your tastes) of speakers.  They're gonna need a lot power, and may need reconditioning, but when everything is just right are a thing of beauty.",
