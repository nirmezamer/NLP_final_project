        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\n**This month features the following Spotlight Topic: Pride Month**\n\nGoing forward, each month we will now be spotlighting various causes and awareness events. Spotlight topics are not mutually exclusive, but given just how many notable causes and awareness events, we can't list all of them in a single post. Please visit our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=effbe2dce5acb460cb837f82579f9b4bc5cfadd02857b407019ceda56f6051e4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) to view other deserving causes and feel free to talk about them and your experiences!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's Tuesday and you know what that means, the sub is in restricted mode (meaning you can comment on existing posts but cannot make a new post for the day). We started this as a protest against Reddit back in June/July but it was decided that we would continue restricting each Tuesday for a few reasons. \n\n1: To encourage people to get off of Reddit for a day and do something else, anything else. Pet a cat, write a fic, touch some grass, go see a movie, whatever. Just go do something else than Reddit for a day if you are able.\n\n2: To give the mods a day off/a day to work on secondary tasks for the sub and clean things up each week\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly...\n\n3: To spend the day highlighting and discussing disability, accessibility, and diversity.  AO3 has always been very good on accessibility and a lot of the world and internet is not, and fandom spaces have been known to be not the best about disability or diversity, so while we are restricted we like to shine a light on these often overlooked parts of fandom and the people that make up this group.  So we have these threads where you can post your fic recs and self-promo about anything to do with disability and/or diversity, and also so people have a safe space to share their stories and discuss these topics.  \n\nGiven the nature of this thread as a safe space for discussion of disability and diversity, we will be much stricter regarding civility and harassment. This includes the following thread specific rules:\n\n**Do not derail:** No hijacking the thread for unrelated topics/discussions.\n\n**Do not talk over others:** Everyone has their own individual experiences and challenges that may differ, and we ask that you show each other respect and do not talk over those sharing their experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are sharing a rec or self-promo with these themes, please use the following format:\n\nRating:  \n\nFandom:  \n\nArchive Warnings:  \n\nTags:  \n\nOther Notes:  \n\nLink:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~The Mod Team\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking for the regular [Bi-weekly Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/wiki/index/megathreads)?\n\n Don't forget to check out [our new forum](https://forumofourown.createaforum.com/) \\- hop on over and get the conversation started!",

My wrist is flaring up, so I've got the compression gloves on and I downed some ibuprofen with dinner. Now it's time to caffeinate so I can suppress the narcolepsy long enough to hopefully work my magic. It's not always easy to make room for my hobbies when my chronic illnesses are working against me, but I do what I can. TTvTT Wish me luck, and I'm extending the well wishes to any of my fellow authors writing even when our bodies are trying to work against us.",

Instead of being in the 2nd act itll be in the 3rd one where everything is already going rapidly downhill ",

Both wrists were also flaring up, so I didn't know if I'd be able to get any writing done. I forced myself to rest for most of the day, but a few hours ago I was feeling ready enough to tackle the latest chapter of my WIP at long last! I just posted it a few minutes ago, and now I'm getting the live reactions from my fiancee and friends. :\\^) It was an uphill battle, but all's well that ends well.",
            "A lot of stress, but at least I'll meet two of my friends next week. I've last seen them in 2019 and 2022 (separately) and they're my only irl friends so, been waiting for this.\n\nAlso I've been proofreading my upcoming oneshot, I'm not happy with it at all though (once again) and I'm trying to make up a way to make it better. This struggle has been present for 3 years now, me not being happy with 90% of my writing  I hope to catch the spark sometime again.",

I understand wanting fic recs and I understand if you're looking for something rare/obscure or very specific and not easily found via tags. \n\nBut \"omg help I can't find any Harry Potter Enemies to Lovers\" or \"smh, no one seems to write [tag/ship that has at least 2,000 fics on Ao3]\". Then there's the subtle sex-negative \"does no one write stuff without smut??\" as of majority of Ao3 fics aren't General/Teen Audiences (yes, I checked the numbers).\n\nI guess I just wish that people were more curious and took the initiative to learn how to navigate the filters to find stuff instead of acting as if we're fic rec generators or something. I know I sound cranky, but I've lost count of the amount of frantic posts I've seen where people are like \"I can't find this fic anywhere, HELP\" only for me to find it within minutes by just entering a few keywords and tags to find it. And I've only been a member for 6 years.\n\nTL;DR: There's nothing wrong with wanting fic recs, but you can definitely just browse the site, play around with filters/tags, and find stuff on your own too.",

            "I've been a member of AO3 for even shorter than you have and, let me tell you, finding the right fic is *easy.* First, I pick the fandom I want- can easily get there through the fandoms menu at the top. After that, I use the sort and filter menu to filter out the stuff I don't want, and force the things I do- Ships, Ratings, Crossovers and Language are usually the ones I'm using, since I'm not as fussy about whether it's fluff or angst (I like both!) or if it's AU (au or not is usually fine by me!)",
            "I don't get people who says AO3 is hard to navigate and find stuff, like have you even been on Fanfiction,net ",
            "It's come to the point where I just ignore most requests for recs TBH, unless they come from either crowds I trust or people adjacent to those. Not only do so many people not try to get through the tags themselves, but they also disparage so many fics and authors in the process - like oh, give me XYZ ship recs because everything sucks! Or give me recs because my 15 minute tops search did not yield a result for my hyperspecific headcanon of how a character should react to XYZ situation. Plus, as you said, they often ask for things that are very very very easy to find and do not require guidance at all.",
            "Ig people still prefer things being recommended as stories that are recommended are considered good. Just like fics with lots of kudos are considered to be masterpieces in terms of quality (which isn't always the case ofc). It's like the pre-selection theory in dating, lmao. If a man suddenly has a girlfriend, he will be considered more attractive and other women are interested in him even though this wasn't the case before.\n\nI don't think you will be able to change the mindset of those people, they have to figure it out themselves.",
            "I have fics recs hack for every fandom on Ao3. It's called \"sort by Kudos\" like??? The filters are right there and you can edit search.",
            "OOF, I felt that. It's a huge pet peeve of mine (meaning: it pushes me into a blind, boiling rage) when people are demanding/entitled in fandom in general, and the learned helplessness just drives me up the fucking wall. They expect to have everything served to them on a silver platter just because they asked and I genuinely do not understand this ... stubborn unwillingness to learn how to navigate a website? And also - don't they want to explore it themselves, find something \\*they\\* will like, instead of relying on strangers' recommendations? It's baffling, I fully agree with you, OP, there's nothing wrong with wanting recs but this strange way of doing it that way kinda defeats the purpose, kills the joy of exploring, and reeks of content consumerism.",
            "I feel this. There is, technically, a Reddit page for my fandoms fic, and all it is anymore is does anyone know any x y or z fics and like no, not off hand, but also Im not going to search for you when its right there.",
            "Man, I hate the tagging system on ao3 like theoretically its amazing it would help you find exactly the store. You want to read in practice, though it is so clunky. Fix our tagged incorrectly due to the author, not knowing the meaning of some of the tags and the fics Im looking for I choose the wrong tags and they dont have that combo. For example, lets say, I wanted to read some villain izuku Midoria stories, so I use that tag it is now full of izuku Midoria, pretending to be a villain. So I add evil izuku midoria. Now that just cut out half of the people who made stories I actually want to read because theyve happened to not use that specific tag. So then I am forced to go back and then dig through mountains and mountains of stuff. I never asked for in order to find something that actually uses the tags and its good quality and has updated and not abandoned. By that time, I have spent three hours looking for stories, when if I just ask someone for their favorites, or looked at a collection I wouldve had it in 10 minutes and then I could read in that time"
