        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\n**This month features the following Spotlight Topic: Pride Month**\n\nGoing forward, each month we will now be spotlighting various causes and awareness events. Spotlight topics are not mutually exclusive, but given just how many notable causes and awareness events, we can't list all of them in a single post. Please visit our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=effbe2dce5acb460cb837f82579f9b4bc5cfadd02857b407019ceda56f6051e4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) to view other deserving causes and feel free to talk about them and your experiences!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's Tuesday and you know what that means, the sub is in restricted mode (meaning you can comment on existing posts but cannot make a new post for the day). We started this as a protest against Reddit back in June/July but it was decided that we would continue restricting each Tuesday for a few reasons. \n\n1: To encourage people to get off of Reddit for a day and do something else, anything else. Pet a cat, write a fic, touch some grass, go see a movie, whatever. Just go do something else than Reddit for a day if you are able.\n\n2: To give the mods a day off/a day to work on secondary tasks for the sub and clean things up each week\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly...\n\n3: To spend the day highlighting and discussing disability, accessibility, and diversity.  AO3 has always been very good on accessibility and a lot of the world and internet is not, and fandom spaces have been known to be not the best about disability or diversity, so while we are restricted we like to shine a light on these often overlooked parts of fandom and the people that make up this group.  So we have these threads where you can post your fic recs and self-promo about anything to do with disability and/or diversity, and also so people have a safe space to share their stories and discuss these topics.  \n\nGiven the nature of this thread as a safe space for discussion of disability and diversity, we will be much stricter regarding civility and harassment. This includes the following thread specific rules:\n\n**Do not derail:** No hijacking the thread for unrelated topics/discussions.\n\n**Do not talk over others:** Everyone has their own individual experiences and challenges that may differ, and we ask that you show each other respect and do not talk over those sharing their experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are sharing a rec or self-promo with these themes, please use the following format:\n\nRating:  \n\nFandom:  \n\nArchive Warnings:  \n\nTags:  \n\nOther Notes:  \n\nLink:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~The Mod Team\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking for the regular [Bi-weekly Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/wiki/index/megathreads)?\n\n Don't forget to check out [our new forum](https://forumofourown.createaforum.com/) \\- hop on over and get the conversation started!",

        "content": "A relatively large game recently got a, well, let's say controversial expansion, and part of that controversy stems from a heavily implied gay relationship that \"came out of nowhere\" and made a very popular character canonically queer and another heavily implied. I happened to very quickly write a new fic of the two characters, (literally I was the first person to post on that relationship tag, that was how out of the left field the pairing was) and it was kind of dark in subject matter but whatever. I then went to sleep, feeling very proud of myself and also gaining a new hyperfixation (and I hope I'm using that term correctly, I do have adhd but I'm not entirely sure if that's the right way put it.) Nice, right?\n\nA big chunk of 4chan was, let's put it politely, not happy with the new plot/lore development. They bickered. They sent death threats. They called each other every slur I could think of and then some more. Their masculine chad character (some guy literally called him that) was a f*ggot, and they can't stand it). They said the dlc was \"fujobait\" and that the studio was going woke. \n\n(Why was I on 4chan? One person there was posting 3d models of the new characters, and I was desperate enough for references that I was willing to brave the wild west of the internet to find it. Also, I was hyperfixating, and there weren't that many people talking about the new expansion yet, but 4chan was very active. Bad idea!)\n\nWhile scrolling through the thread, I discovered someone posting an ao3 link while multiple people were discoursing. Woah, I thought, someone else wrote for this pairing, too? Great!\n\nI click the link.\n\nIts my fic.\n\nThe guy was trying to direct a hoard of pissed off basement dwelling 4chan bigots to my fic.\n\nI hate my life.\n\nI knew that I would get some flak for writing that piece (it is slightly controversial, after all) but I thought the worst that could happen was that someone would go \"Oh but its problematic!!!\" And I will just like block them or whatever.\n\nTo make this worse, a close online friend who I haven't disclosed my ao3 to also discovered my fic because of it, and he wasn't very supportive. I don't think he judge me or anything (he's a nice guy and also writes somewhat dark fics) but like... He might tell my circle of online friends and I don't think all of them would be as accepting of me, I guess.\n\nI hate this so much. I wish I never dipped my toes in writing darkfic and nsfw. I wish 4chan sucked less. Ugh!",

            "make it so only people with accounts can look at your fic and turn on comment moderation on and get ahead of any possible hate. \n\nalso dont stop writing what you want to write just because others might not like it. if your \"friends\" dont accept  you over how you write about FICTIONAL characters then they are immature, dont have critical thinking skills and not worth your time. \n\nI am sorry you have to deal with any of that in the first place tho.",
            "This is terrible! I'm sorry this happened. Some ideas - \n\n1. You can archive-lock your fics. Edit the fic, then under Privacy, choose \"Only show your work to registered users.\" Then, people will need an account to see it at all, or to read it. \n\n2. Also under Privacy, you can turn off guest comments, and/or enable comment moderation. I'd definitely turn off guest comments for this, even if you don't use any of these other options.\n\n3. You can put the fic into an anonymous collection. I posted about my experience doing that: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/173vijg/posting_to_ao3_as_anonymous_my_experience_so_far/). It was very easy. There are other guides out there as well. You can still receive and reply to comments (as Anonymous), and you'll still get notified of them using whatever notification option you use (I would still turn off guest comments if you do this). If the trouble dies down in a few weeks or months, you can take it out of the anonymous collection. It's not permanent.\n\n4. Permanent - you can orphan or delete the fic. Orphaning: your username won't show up on it anymore; you lose all control over it at that point, but you won't get notifications for any of the comments. You can instead delete it; if you orphan it, you also lose the ability to ever delete it, add to it, or change it any way. But orphaning it instead allows people to continue reading it. (I never want people to delete fics, but remember the option is there.)",

Especially since you were likely on /vg/\u00a0\n\n\nAnd no point in going wtf at the person. Causing harm is exactly what they wanted\u00a0\n\n\n4chan is great for leaks and such because of the anonymity, but that same anonymity means they can and will be as vile as they feel like it just because they can",

Most people I know who genuinely enjoy fanfic have accounts, and the time buffer to make one makes trolling a bit more difficult. Lock the comments to moderating mode too.\n\nDon\u2019t bother with the 4chan side at all. They suck, they\u2019ll get bored of your fic in a week as long as you ignore them all.\n\nAs an aside, just personally, if it happens to be Elden Ring, I don\u2019t know if \u2018canonically queer\u2019 is the best terminology (or entirely correct) due just to the fact that it\u2019s >!dubiously consensual demigod incest!<.",
