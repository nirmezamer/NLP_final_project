Both work solidly. so one is 9 years old and the other is 7 lol. About time to upgrade and might go for the new m4's that hopefully dont have the latest physical exploit.",

I spent about $150 on upgrades and is as smooth as my M1 MacBook.  Granted, it isn't metal, so it can't do stage manager and minor things like that, but still runs smooth as hell and is on Sonoma.",
