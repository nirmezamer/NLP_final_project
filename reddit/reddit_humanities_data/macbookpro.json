            "Insurance is generally worth it if you cannot afford to replace something outright, eg. car and house insurance \n\nGiven it\u2019s 4x your annual salary, it seems like it would probably be a valuable addition.",

            "I\u2019m still hung up on \u201c4 times my salary\u201d. My guy don\u2019t buy that computer",
            "It\u2019s a portable computer, don\u2019t chance fate.\n\nTLDR: tea spilt on the keyboard, would not have been covered at all, but with Apple Care it was 150.\n\nFull Story\n\nMy MacBook Pro is the M1 Max version. I bought it day one because I knew I needed something for all the video editing I started doing, and it\u2019s become my favourite computer. I\u2018ve always taken pristine care of it, but one day I had a terrible accident with some tea that spilt on top of it.\n\nI did everything by the book when that happened, shut it down, patted it as dry as I could, flipped it upside down open faced and air dried that mf.\n\nI didn\u2019t touch it for two days, and during that entire ordeal my Apple Care just renewed for the following year:\n\nLet me tell you I REALLY am glad that it did. That repair would not have been covered at all in any capacity, and my config was ~4000 CAD.\n\nSo I took to my local certified technician and after a few days I got it back. The damage was my trackpad died and they keys were getting stuck.\n\nThe replaced the whole bottom case, so new keyboard, trackpad, and battery. Cost me only 150 CAD for the repair.\n\nTake it from me, always **ALWAYS** get Apple Care if it\u2019s a mobile device.",
            "The only time I\u2019d skip it is if replacing it is not a problem for you. That means either a very high income or a very healthy savings account.",
            "just get a case and take good care of it. a good laptop bag is good to have as well",
            "depends on your luck, can you get pre-owned? i have only gotten pre-owned macs that still work to this day, a macbook air 2015 for like $250 back in 2017, and a macbook pro 2018 with 4thunderboldt/16ram/512ssd/i7 for like $1k that was like new, the prev customer replaced the shell unit from apple so it had like 5 cycles on the new battery. when retail was like $2.5k lol. Both work solidly. so one is 9 years old and the other is 7 lol. About time to upgrade and might go for the new m4's that hopefully dont have the latest physical exploit.",
            "If you are careful with your laptops then you won't need any sort of apple care or whatever care.",
            "I\u2019ve had MacBook pros for the past 15+ years and never once bought or used AppleCare. One battery bloated and they replaced it free at an Apple Store."

            "I ran Windows for ten years on a Retina MacBook Pro with great success. There are some quirks for sure but dual booting saved me so many times. Today I don't really need any longer since I can fix most problems on both Mac and Windows today. Bootcamp is the way to go for anything that requires GPU or heavy CPU. I tried some virtualization software to run Windows inside MacOS for a while but the performance was to bad for anything useful so I always returned to Bootcamp.",
            "But that is not running windows. It is macos.",
            "So lemme tell you from experience. It starts with you buying a really clean vintage but still usable MacBook like this 2014 in the pic. You say you bought it for a specific reason. In about a year, your bedroom is gonna look like some sort of obsolete Mac smuggling operation and people are gonna accuse you of hoarding.",
            "Parallels Desktop to run at the same time macos and windows",
            "This is a pretty bad choice. \n\nThe laptop is declared obsolete by apple, macOS no longer receives updates/security patches, and it won't be able to run windows 11 next year when windows 10 is killed off. \n\nFor the price of that you probably could have got a decent 4-5yr old thinkpad.",

            "I just bought a 16\u201d m3 pro with 36 GB of memory, trading in my 2019 16\u201d i7 with 16 GB memory. I went with the extra memory because I wanted to run multiple VMs simultaneously. I should have done my research. Parallels dropped support for windows versions up to 10. They only support windows 11 now. Which is fair, I suppose, considering Microsoft won\u2019t support Win10 in a year and a half. \n\nIt\u2019s probably easier and more efficient to use Azure VMs at this point, anyway. But what am I going to do with all this memory? lol",
            "Don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m not gonna be doing any banking or anything, might patch it up to Monterey with OCLP and once I get what I need it to run running under windows it\u2019ll be air gapped. I\u2019ve always wanted one of these and didn\u2019t have any excuse to get it till now. Thanks for the advice tho"
