        "content": "Hello, I just bought a subscription to adobe creative cloud all apps. I am trying to download photoshop but it wont allow me. I get error code \"120\" each time I try to download. I searched it up and this code means I don't have enough storage/disk space. So I go to clear some room only to realize that I have about 400 gb of storage. I go download premiere pro and it downloaded perfectly fine with no issues. Why may this be? Maybe because I tried downloading photoshop earlier on the website instead of the creative could app? It also says that \\\\adobeTemp already exists in the error summary, but when I try searching it up to delete it, I cannot find that file. Another thing, when I go to the microsoft store, it says installed, but when I go to my apps I can't find Adobe Photoshop anywhere. I can't find any trace of a Photoshop file or anything. Please help. Maybe a firewall issue? \n\nUPDATE: Now I'm having the same issue with installing Illustrator. I think it's a firewall issue because it says in my notifications that Creative cloud services are blocked. Please check your firewall settings. Now how would I do that?",
