This new wiki is very much still a WIP, there's many things not yet added to it, and the pages that do exist are mostly still unfinished. \n\nI welcome recommendations to help improve it, either posted here in the comments or sent to me directly. Note reddit doesn't show me chat notifications for some reason, so sending over dms would work better. \n\n[Here is a link to the wiki](/r/trackers/wiki/index)",

Anyone that says otherwise is just stupid.   Scenetime has HD 1080p shows and movies at reasonable sizes... between 500mb and 3gb typically. None of the gigantic 10+gb files the other sites have.  I use TL to see what is new for the day and then I will go download from Scenetime or one of it's sister sites like Speed.cd and Torrenting.com.   By the way you can join Torrenting.com right now if you want.  The nice thing about scenetime and Torrenting.com is that you can seed as many torrents as you want and get bonus points from ALL of them, where IPT and TL and TD have a limit. You can only get points from 15 torrents on IPT/TD and only up to 100 on TL.  \n\nJust wait for it... the kids with their panties in a bunch or sand in their vagina will say stupid shit like \"oooh its horrible because it's part of IPT\",.... fuck them straight in the ass.  The scandalous shit was over 10 years ago there is nothing wrong with using any of their sites.  They don't do anything malicious. I've been on IPT for 14 years.
