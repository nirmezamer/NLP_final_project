        "content": "I (F25) met this guy (M28) from Tinder and naiintimidate ako dahil mahirap lang ako.\n\nOk sya kausap, masaya lagi mga chat namin pero nung nameet ko sya, bigla ako naintimidate. Halatang galing sya sa well-off na pamilya. Kung pano sya magsalita, kung pano sya kumilos, halatang di nakapag ulam ng asin.\n\nI stalked his socials and shet, bata palang sya nagtatravel na sila ng family nya sa iba\u2019t-ibang bansa. Samantalang ako, Cubao palang napupuntahan ko hahaha. He\u2019s an only child. Ako panganay, breadwinner pa. Graduate din sya sa Big 4, ako naman graduate sa school dyan sa tabi tabi hahaha.\n\nAndami nyang circle of friends and mukha din silang mayayaman lahat. Ako walang kaibigan, lagi lang nasa bahay at walang kahit isang hobby.\n\nNung nagkita kami, it was fun. Masaya lang kami nag uusap. I like his personality. Mabait, gentleman at magaan kasama. Nagkakachat pa rin kami ngayon and he\u2019s asking me to meet him again.\n\nNgayon nga mga mare ko napapaisip ako, itutuloy ko pa ba tong panaginip kong to or dapat na kong gumising sa realidad?\nMahirap lang ako, galing akong probinsya, lumaki sa barong barong na bahay at walang matinong cr, nag-aarinola lang kami HAHAHAHAHA. Pero nung nagkawork ako, napagawa ko na yung bahay namin, may cr na kami hahaha.\n\nAyun nga, medyo kumikita na ko ngayon ng malaki kaya kahit papano mukha na akong tao. Medyo pretty na pero yun nga, hampaslupa pa din hahaha. Wala naman akong maiooffer kundi pagmamahal lang na busilak. \n\nTapusin ko na ba to habang maaga pa? Natatakot ako na umabot pa kami sa point na malalaman nya kung gaano ako kadukha at aayawan nya ko. O matanggap nya kaya ko? Hays tangina ang hirap maging mahirap. I need your advice!!!",

            "He wants to see you again! Go for it. \n\nAnd regarding your economic status, be upfront. It\u2019s part of your context - which also means batak ka sa buhay, marunong mag desisyon, street smart, lista. You have other things to offer. \n\nIf the activity/hangout is too expensive, be upfront and say so. \u201cDo you mind if we do something else more low key? Budget is a little tight now but should ease up soon.\u201d If he insists and judges you for it, then he\u2019s an asshole. If he offers to cover expenses, bahala ka if you say yes or no hahaha, he agrees na Dutch treat and adjusts, then you know okay ang personality. \n\nDon\u2019t give up on a shot for love just because you feel intimidated. Pera ng pamilya niya yan, Hindi niya perang sarili. Go lang girl.",
            "Actually, maraming parents sa school na pinag aaralan ng anak namin. Chinese ang lalaki, filipina ang babae or from mayaman na pamilya ang lalaki and filipina ang babae from the province na nagwork sa manila or galing sa province.\n\nYou know, kayo lang nag iisip ng ganyan. People needs true people and will love them whole heartedly and di lang pera habol sa kanila. Will accept them who they are. Di pera nila.\n\nDi lahat ng may kaya afford o gusto mag asawa ng may kaya. Why? They need a wife not a boss. Stressed na sila sa work, sa negosyo, sa mga employees nila at iba pa.\n\nGive it a chance. Be a good friend or kung mag work a good gf. If magkatuluyan kayo, a good wife.\n\nThey just need a faithful wife and wants to have a happy family.\n\nIf he can accept who you are, accept who they are. May mga in laws, ok naman sila or eventuallt naging ok naman.\n\nMay mga ganyan. Di lahat, meron ding mang gagamit lang. Be alert, some people wants to play pa and some wants to settle na. Kaya caveat parin.",

            "Ang importante girl ay kung ano ang pangarap mo sa buhay. Kung maging kayo man, wag kang umasa sa kanya. Build your career and your own life. Iba ang life mo, iba din siya. In the end, whatever happens, either you will have both, or you will still have your life.",
            "you both seems nice naman tuloy nyo po :( unless mg offer ng 10m ang magulang nya",
            "Don\u2019t overthink it, gurl. Enjoy the getting-to-know-you phase. \n\nMinsan kase ang utak natin inuunahan tayo. Kaya nasa-sabotage ang potential ng mga pangyayari sa buhay natin. Has happened to me soooo many times.\n\nNakakamiss din ang mga kilig moments na ganyan hehe. But maswerte na din ako na I\u2019ve found my partner \ud83d\ude0a Naalala ko tuloy yung ligawan days namin hihi."

        "content": "I just want to preface this by saying that I am not a hater of the group. However, I don't particularly like their music as well, but I recognize that it's good. I also don't know anything about the members\n\nI'm just genuinely curious why and how BINI became so popular when other groups with the same style, vibe, and genre have been around for a while. What sets them and their music apart from the other groups?\n\nAgain, I'm just really fascinated because I've never heard of them before Feb or March this year, then suddenly, they're everywhere. Also, did they replace the K-Pop wave in the PH music discourse? Because I could've sworn that the last few years, it was all K-Pop, then Taylor Swift's Era's Tour happened, then suddenly, it was all BINI.",

            "Marketing strategy was on point once they hit the trend chart. Their producers kept on adding rocket boost sa kanilang hits by making dance out of it, adding it as bgm sa mga reels/stories/myday and everything. They never left the sky once they had been to it. The cons is the immense pressure and pagod to the girls as all those investments will be milked back to the pockets of their producers.",
            "for me not bc of good marketing, please sobrang waley ng pagppromote nila, fans pa siguro. mas maganda edits and promotion ng fans.\n\nalso, talents aside na super winner naman, sobrang havey ng personality nila. as in. kanal humor na bet na bet ng mga tao ngayon. for me, sa humor talaga nila ko nahila bago ako nabaliw sa performances nila. as in just saw clips from hardworking fans na todo promote kahit mas marami bashers noon (kesho di naman daw sikat lol).",
            "A good marketing team and talent",
            "personality and a catchy song got the people hooked",
            "Been saying this even before, talentado ang mga pinoy, kulang lang sa boost ng suporta mula sa atin. Kita naman kahit sa ibang group like SB19 na kaya naman pala suportahan ang sariling atin. What sets apart ay yung recent album nila bop, feel-good and the mass can enjoy and relate to kaya nagsunod sunod na sa pagshashare sa Tiktok and social media. Also, yung humor at kalog ng girls, madaling makarelate ang mga pinoy. Masaya sila suportahan. Matagal na rin ang Bini and even before grabe yung training nila para maihalintulad sa ibang bansa na kaya naman pala natin, na girl group na hindi lang kpop and all na kayang suportahan. Yung popularity nila is well-deserved kasi ginapang nila thru hardwork and patience. Success naman is not overnight. \n\nMadali na ngayon magviral isang clip lang, pero yung longevity ng popularity, yun yung need imaintain kaya management has been striking while the iron is hot. Wag lang sana ioverwork at continuous alagaan yung girls as they already have solid fanbase. Sana magtuloy tuloy para mas lalong magkaroon ng hope and dreams ang mga pinoy.",

            "Catchy songs, beautiful faces yung main factor pero as a girl group, i love their bond and individual quirks. Maalaga din sila sa fans nila, walang tapon yung talent nila."
