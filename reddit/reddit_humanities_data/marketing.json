I want to retire my parents off of this business while they're still in their early 60s, and I think we've got a solid foundation.  \n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* High shipping costs in Canada make B2C Shopify sales far less profitable than wholesale.\n* I've reached out to stores like HomeGoods, Anthropologie, Indigo, West Elm, and Free People but haven't made any progress.\n\n**What We've Tried So Far:**\n\n* Exploring platforms like Faire for wholesale orders.\n* Contacting buyers at local co-op groceries and boutiques.\n* Built a dedicated wholesale section on our website.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* Does anyone have experience with successful wholesale growth in the health and wellness sector? We're a home/lifestyle product, not a food or drink. \n* Are there specific distributors or brokers you recommend in the wellness niche? This is something new to me, and could be our key to success.\n\nWe charge $15USD retail per product, and selling 1000 units a month would be enough for my dad to quit his job and focus on this dream full-time.",

It really feels like 90% of the agricultural industry is lagging 20 years behind the rest of the world in terms of marketing.\n\nAnyways, this one has been very tricky for me. How would you market a variety of apple (not proprietary but this is the one you grow) against other varieties and competitors selling the same variety? You have your own brand and so do others.\n\nLet's say yours isn't even \"the best\" of that variety. There are other farms just as good or better. As you know, with fruits the quality can vary substantially from year to year, month to month or even week to week. So I could say my apple is better this week but next week somebody else's might taste better.\n\nIt's not even proprietary, and you can't really just pull a new variety out your ass like you could a flavor of chips. I can't just \"create\" a blue apple or something. \n\nYou're not even the cheapest either because large companies have more money to contract farmers to grow for them at lower prices but offering more financial security. \n\nThe first problem is the store buyers, often too lazy to switch, not open to the idea of carrying a new product, are on kickbacks with other suppliers, etc.\n\nThen you have to convince consumers to buy it once it's on shelves.\n\nAny ideas or tips?",

(Even people who buy liquid death will just buy some other brand of water if they find themselves unable to buy liquid death when they want water, and liquid death has much more of a brand identity than your apples will ever have.)\n\nYou have to figure out how to get your apples into as many apple-selling places as possible: grocery stores, convenience stores, concession stands, hotel breakfast bars, and so on. If you can do that in a cost effective way, you'll sell more apples than the competitors who don't do it. Even the most brand-loyal apple buyers only buy from the same apple company once or twice a year, and most apple-buyers aren't remotely brand-loyal. Just be right in front of them when they want to buy an apple, and a decent percentage of them will pick your apples, because most people don't think too much about apples.\n\n(By the way, if your apple looks noticeably worse than most other apples, you might be making life much harder for yourself than you need to. Your apple needs to not stand out as being obviously inferior, so that a consumer can pick your apple without too much conscious thought.)",
