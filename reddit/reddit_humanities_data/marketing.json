I usually don't need to use Tableau to analyze data from finance, for example, but marketing data.\n\nBut people have very different perspectives. There are people who think that marketing is communication, that marketing is a creative field instead of a business field, and too many people who think that marketing is digital marketing.\n\nPeople may be able to find a job with the skills you mentioned like social media and PPC. But, when we open a job like that, we usually get a flood of applicants as those skills are very common. Those are probably the easiest skills to find among applicants, rarely a competitive advantage to give the company a reason to hire someone. So, when we have tons of applicants with those skills, just having that isn't enough to stand out, you look the same as many others.\n\nThings like sustainable competitive advantage, positioning, and differentiation are usually very important in marketing. We often learn about those things long before we get into social media and PPC. It's not mandatory to know analytics specifically, but you should have those things.",
