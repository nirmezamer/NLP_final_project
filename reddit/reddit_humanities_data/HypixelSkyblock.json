        "content": " Welcome to the [r/HypixelSkyblock](https://www.reddit.com/r/HypixelSkyblock/) Weekly Thread!\n\nThe Weekly Thread serves two purposes:\n\n* to ask progression questions that comply with the subreddit rules,\n* to find dungeon teammates.\n\nTo prevent confusion in the comments, it is best if your comments follow specific formats depending on what you are using this thread for. Please read everything carefully to see which format applies for your situation.\n\n***Progression Questions \u2014 Info***\n\nTo prevent large amounts of spam or small posts, you can ask smaller questions that don't need full posts here. Questions that should be asked here instead of making its own thread include but are not limited to:\n\n* what stage of the game you are in,\n* what you should progress for,\n* questions about items and minions,\n* questions about game mechanics,\n\n*However, some questions that comply with DTD have been asked very often, and as such should be asked here instead. As of this week, those questions are:*\n\n* Baby Yeti Pet/Shadow Assassin Chestplate\n* Livid Dagger/Shadow Fury/Flower of Truth\n* Baby Yeti Pet/Blue Whale Pet\n\n***Progression Questions \u2014 Formatting***\n\n*Please start each progression question/comment with a line with the prefix \"\\[PROGRESSION\\]\" (not case-sensitive), followed by your* *sky.shiiyu.moe* *(aka SkyCrypt) link followed by whatever questions you may have (example below!):*\n\n>\\[PROGRESSION\\]: [https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/GoodboyFM/Pineapple](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/GoodboyFM/Pineapple) how do i craft more minions\n\n***Dungeon LFGs (looking for group) \u2014 Info/Formatting***\n\nAs per popular demand, dungeon LFGs are now taking place in this post. However, as this thread also has other types of questions, you should follow this format in order to make your LFG request distinguishable:\n\n>\\[DUNGEON LFG\\]: [https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/GoodboyFM/Pineapple](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/GoodboyFM/Pineapple)\\- Dungeons Class + Class level (ie: Tank 24)- Dungeons Type + Level (ie: Catacombs 24)- Armor + Pet (ie: Full 5 star fragged HPB'd Shadow Assassin armor, level 100 Enderman)- Weapon(s) (ie: recombobulated 5 star withered FOT)**1**\\- Support items (if applicable, ie: Mana Flux Power Orb, Weird Tuba)\n\n\\*\\*1\\*\\*If you have multiple of the same weapon (ie multiple Bonemerangs), just list the quantity of the weapon that you have (\"4 bonemerangs\", \"5 bonemerangs\", etc).\n\n***General Housekeeping in This Thread***\n\nIf you want to post a dungeons LFG and a progression question at the same time, please do so in separate comments.\n\nRemember to also check out the sidebar and subreddit wiki (the \"Menu\" and \"About\" tabs on Reddit mobile respectively) which have some other helpful links that might answer your questions.\n\nHappy Minecrafting!",

I have killed about 200 automations, and theoretically with a 1% drop chance for each part, plus magic find, I should have had about 8-9% for each to get a drop, and that's not counting the 30 of them that were lv 150, with 2% each. I haven't gotten any actual drops from them, outside of two times: Both were assists. Can someone please explain why this is?",
            "Hi ya'll, i started playing skyblock again after a bit of a break. (half a year ish on and off) I have quite a bit of money available and im not sure what to work towards. I bought an AOTS for a bit, decided i was done with revs, sold the aots and my shadow fury and im currently raising funds for a giants sword. (I have the money its just stuck in an auction that i forgot to check the length of before bidding. Im dumb i know) I've invested quite a lot of time and money into farming as well and i started making a custom pumpkin plot but i don't know if its even worth doing as just the premade plots already are infinite and long enough for a contest. What should i do? Is it even worth buying a giants sword? Thanks!\n\nign is \\_kiwan"

        "content": "I will see lvl 140 players with a 3b nw, combat 25 and 500mp, and a hype telling me that they\u2019re better than me at a lower lvl. Why the fuck do people think they just win the game by getting a hype and investing nothing into other aspects of the game. \n\n\u201cYou only have a GS HAHAHHAHAHA\u201d yeah and I\u2019m also combat 50 with 800 mp, I don\u2019t even main combat, and I actually level up other parts of the game. \n\nPeople act like you should be maxed out on everything just because you\u2019re a higher lvl than them when they\u2019re just fucking lazy. Grinding skyblock xp is the cheapest thing you can possibly do and being \u201cbetter\u201d at a lower lvl doesn\u2019t mean jack shit. It means that you don\u2019t know how to grind the one most basic and easy thing you could possibly grind and that you waste money by making dumb financial decisions like buying a hype when you have 500mp and a 3b nw. Wow it\u2019s so impressive that half your nw is in your weapon and your combat lvl is complete shit!\n\nI used to wonder why higher lvl players never speak or respond to nons and I\u2019m slowly realizing why. It is just completely insufferable to talk to some people because they constantly compare themself to you and demean you when you\u2019re not completely rushed on progression.",

I know this because I was in the early days like them.",
