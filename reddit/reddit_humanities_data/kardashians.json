        "content": "I know I\u2019m about to be the millionth person to share this same sentiment about the recent episode, but I just have to add my 2 cents. \n\nI get saying things for a dramatic effect, but this really bothered me. Kim uses such over the top verbiage to manipulate. I\u2019ve known people with actual agoraphobia. They struggled to go for walks, take their kids to school, and even a simple sit down get together in a restaurant was extremely anxiety inducing for them.\n\nCalling her agoraphobic because she\u2019s not at the club every week or willing to hop on a private jet for random trips while her kids are in school is crazy. How does Kim think that 90% of Americans live their lives? For most of us, vacations are planned months ahead and require A LOT of foresight and planning. Even with no kids involved.",

            "I think Kim gets triggered when she sees her siblings finding happiness in the simple ways she can\u2019t",
            "If I was rich I would be chillin inside my mansion where all of my needs were met as well lol they have and can have anything they want while being on the couch surrounded by family and friends - you wouldn\u2019t catch me ANYWHERE lol \nKim just doesn\u2019t want their saga to die down and she needs all sisters to be up and running so the family doesn\u2019t quietly fade out.",
            "I agree with Khloe, Kim is obviously projecting. I really hated how no one stood up for Khloe. She seems like a phenomenal mom who just enjoys being with her kids. I think. Kim is feeling insecure because she thinks being with her kids is a nightmare and she admits she isn\u2019t strict enough to keep them in line. I think Kim probably sees how Khloe is raising her children and may be overcome with jealousy, which is really sad. Kim seems to struggle with motherhood and it comes more naturally to Kourtney and Khloe.",
            "Kim will say anything to make absentee parenting seem like the better choice.",
            "Khloe will have the last laugh. While her kids will willingly visit her and call her and love her.. Kim's will only see her kids for photo ops where they get paid.",
            "Kim was lashing around, looking for barbs to throw at Khloe, while maintaining a virtuous appearance herself.\n\n  \nI think Kim was trying to appear sympathetic and genuinely concerned by putting a mental health label on her snide comments.\n\nIt's transparently bullshit. \n\nIt's hard to take any of the Kardashians' comments on Khloe's self isolation seriously. Khloe comes across as level headed, and I trust her opinion of herself and her level of engagement with the world. I hope she does get out of the house frequently enough - humans are social creatures, and a social network is important - but getting out doesn't have to mean showing up for parties and events the way Kris and Kim want her to. She's a single parent with two young children, and even though she has help, she's the leader of that household and I think she's right to want to be present to provide stability and structure for her children's lives. I know Kris and Kim DO NOT CARE about their kids in that way.",
            "Perhaps Kim is oikophobic (fear of home) or/and \npaedophobic (fear of children) she\u2019s definitely not tomophobic (acute fear of surgery) or Scopaphobic (fear of being watched)",
            "I used to be agoraphobic and went through grueling exposure therapy. It is so rude for people to just fling it out like that the term, khloe to me just seems to be in her \u201cnesting\u201d stage of life. And good for her her babies aren\u2019t going to be this young forever!",
            "I think it eats away at Kim that Khloe and Kylie actually like spending time with their kids. Misery loves company and she\u2019s the only one who hates being a mom.",
            "Kim is jealous that Khloe is (from what it looks like) able to both be strict with True but also have an incredibly close relationship with her. It\u2019s like Kim is scared of being disliked by her children which is why she\u2019ll never start setting rules with them. \n\nI don\u2019t know Khloe\u2019s social calendar but yeah maybe she just feels she wants to be close to her children right now and she can afford it! I wonder if there is something else that\u2019s happening because Kim seems desperate to get Khloe to meet someone. \n\nI found the fight they had ridiculous and pure projection from Kim. Like she was putting words on Khloe\u2019s mouth that she had not said. \n\nKim should try staying home for 1 month but she will never do it. She can\u2019t live her life without hopping on a private plane at least twice a month. \n\nI agree with Khloe\u2019s words and children want to feel your presence. Kim\u2019s children are being raised by the nannies and two guilty parents.  \n\nI feel sorry for Kim but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to feel sorry for Khlo\u00e9."

            "This show is background.\n\nThe glorious part of the show for me is how much I don't care.\n\nHow few real problems they have. And how much money they have to solve any problems that arise on and off camera. As well as how they manipulate and control their storylines.\n\nCase studies.\n\nNONE of that is a recommendation to watch the show. This warning is for anyone that does not want to waste their time watching fodder.\n\nI like their brand of fodder, and I refuse to convince anyone to like their televised pandering. But don't expect anything more than pandering and The Onion personified. \ud83e\udd18",

Their entire lives seem to revolve around money and image and I think it seems so fucking depressing.
