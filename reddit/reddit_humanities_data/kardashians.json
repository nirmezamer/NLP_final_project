        "content": "This season of the Kardashians is leaving something to be desired. It feels like we get 10% \u201creality content\u201d and the rest is a staged conversation between sisters or solo interviews. It\u2019s too curated. My friend recently made a good point\u2026 The latest episode centers around some staged argument between Kim and Khloe (snooze) but Kim also mentions that things were crazy at home and she had to call her mom to help watch the kids. THAT is what we want to see - Kris jumping in last minute to babysit! Tbh I\u2019m starting to miss KUWTK\u2026 anyone else?",

        "content": "I know I\u2019m about to be the millionth person to share this same sentiment about the recent episode, but I just have to add my 2 cents. \n\nI get saying things for a dramatic effect, but this really bothered me. Kim uses such over the top verbiage to manipulate. I\u2019ve known people with actual agoraphobia. They struggled to go for walks, take their kids to school, and even a simple sit down get together in a restaurant was extremely anxiety inducing for them.\n\nCalling her agoraphobic because she\u2019s not at the club every week or willing to hop on a private jet for random trips while her kids are in school is crazy. How does Kim think that 90% of Americans live their lives? For most of us, vacations are planned months ahead and require A LOT of foresight and planning. Even with no kids involved.",

            "If I was rich I would be chillin inside my mansion where all of my needs were met as well lol they have and can have anything they want while being on the couch surrounded by family and friends - you wouldnt catch me ANYWHERE lol \nKim just doesnt want their saga to die down and she needs all sisters to be up and running so the family doesnt quietly fade out.",
            "I agree with Khloe, Kim is obviously projecting. I really hated how no one stood up for Khloe. She seems like a phenomenal mom who just enjoys being with her kids. I think. Kim is feeling insecure because she thinks being with her kids is a nightmare and she admits she isnt strict enough to keep them in line. I think Kim probably sees how Khloe is raising her children and may be overcome with jealousy, which is really sad. Kim seems to struggle with motherhood and it comes more naturally to Kourtney and Khloe.",
            "Kim will say anything to make absentee parenting seem like the better choice.",
            "Khloe will have the last laugh. While her kids will willingly visit her and call her and love her.. Kim's will only see her kids for photo ops where they get paid.",
            "Perhaps Kim is oikophobic (fear of home) or/and \npaedophobic (fear of children) shes definitely not tomophobic (acute fear of surgery) or Scopaphobic (fear of being watched)",
            "I used to be agoraphobic and went through grueling exposure therapy. It is so rude for people to just fling it out like that the term, khloe to me just seems to be in her nesting stage of life. And good for her her babies arent going to be this young forever!",
            "I think it eats away at Kim that Khloe and Kylie actually like spending time with their kids. Misery loves company and shes the only one who hates being a mom.",
            "Tbh, it just seems like theyre searching to create drama for the shows sake and its not their real feelings or words. They keep regurgitating the same storylines and drama points that its become boring.",
            "All Im gonna say, is my favorite seasons are when the sisters fight w Kim. I know bullying is bad, but Kim comes off like she was raised as an only child. I felt like after she left Kanye people would love her so much more so than they did in the beginning of the show. I thought wed see her be this amazing mom and yeahhhhhhhhh lmao. \n\nI know its mean, I dont care. I enjoy watching the show since day 1 bc her sisters hated her  "

This show is beyond asinine. Read the room people. You guys live on another planet now. No one is funny anymore, they are all monotone, and one of Kim\u2019s problems would probably be the best day of my life. I feel my brain cells dying listening to this. I can\u2019t believe they are still on tv.\n",

            "Its disgusting how she worries about fake snow and rain issues on Christmas when people are dying, homeless and all other types of REAL devastation. Most of us could live 15 yrs on the money they spent on a party that lasts only one evening.  Kims priorities are really showing a lot in this season.",

Khloe literally is a shell of herself now, very boring. yes i can see she\u2019s a great mom, but as far as personality, it\u2019s bland. Kendall is bitchy! her only storyline is her anxiety, she is also very bland. Kourtney is the most boring person i have EVER seen, she\u2019s not too interesting. don\u2019t really know how anyone can enjoy projecting themselves into the world like that.\ni understand that when the NEW series first came out, it was their \u201craw, original and real selves\u201d but it\u2019s so far from that, it will never be comparable to \u2018Keeping up with the Kardashians\u2019.",
