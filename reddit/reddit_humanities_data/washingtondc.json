            "Happy Pride, DC! Anyone have recommendations for alternatives to the big parade? Lately I feel like it's all just banks and hotels marching. I'd love to go to something that feels more like the old Pride parade.",
            "Interning in DC for the summer. Where can I play pick up soccer?",
            "Where can I get a good breakfast burrito near downtown? Looking for something casual and quick, not a sit down brunch spot.",
            "Is there a comprehensive map or list of non-driving options for getting out of DC? E.g., Metro, Amtrak, Flixbus/Megabus (RIP?), MARC, VRE, Virginia Breeze, commuter buses, etc...",
            "We are visiting in early August for two days with our three children. We get into Regan at 9.30 at night. I\u2019m not sure what to do for hotel- we\u2019d like cheap and clean, like everyone else, I imagine. We have a car rental, but if we could get rid of it for those row days we could stay closer near the Mall area, but then I\u2019m not sure how to get from the airport to a hotel\u2026",
            "My husband has a conference in Reston next week (we\u2019d be driving from the Philly area), so we were thinking he\u2019d drop me off at a Metro stop with my 2 year old for the day. Since it\u2019s going to be quite hot, maybe we should skip the zoo and go indoors? Where are your favorite places to cool off that aren\u2019t far from a Metro stop? We\u2019d be north of the city, so the Silver line or Red line would probably be easiest? Thank you!",
            "Would you live on the 600 block of Newton Pl NW? It\u2019s only a few blocks from the Petworth metro, but the layout of that block causes no drive-through traffic and creates an ideal place for drug dealing.\n\nI know it\u2019s a bad area but I can\u2019t picture out bad it is. Would I be stupid to rent or buy a place there? Would I get shot sitting on the front porch or walk my dog at night?",
            "Looking at place at Capitol Park (SW/Waterfront). Anyone live in this area? Looking to get a better feel for what this neighborhood is like and SW/Waterfront as a whole. How do you like the neighborhood?",
            " I've done some searching and no luck so I'm guessing the answer is \"no\", but is there a bar in the DC area where they would have the upcoming Stanley Cup Finals games with the sound on and it's likely some other folks would be watching?  Odds aren't helped by it being one team that has a very small fanbase and another from the opposite corner of the continent haha",
            "Hello, I live in Baltimore and I am currently seeking a job in DC & any other nearby areas where the metro train is nearby. I am interested in positions (either part-time or paid internship) in the education field, which areas should I focus on?"

I've always wondered how people manage to have such large and active friend groups that regularly go out and have fun together.\n\nEven with family in the area, it's like pulling teeth to get anyone to do anything unless it's a major life event. It's been tough trying to build a social circle here, and I really miss having that close-knit group of friends to share experiences with.\n\nSo, I'm reaching out to the community for advice and maybe even a bit of help. How do you find or build such amazing friend groups? Are there any tips for connecting with like-minded people who are up for fun and adventures? And, if there's a spot open, can I join your friend group? \ud83d\ude05\n\nAny advice or invitations would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "You need an anchoring point to expand your social circle. Sometimes it's an organized activity like sports, sometimes it's just your super charismatic friend who is always meeting new and interesting people and bringing them to stuff. The easiest way I've found when moving to a new neighborhood is to become a regular at a local bar with cool/fun bartenders. Cool bartenders tend to have cool regulars, and if you don't suck then you'll find opportunities to hang outside of that setting, and then after a while you'll be on the text chain, and then you're golden.",

Most of them never checked on me\u2026 they\u2019re people you have fun with but no one you\u2019d call if you were at the hospital needing someone to come check on you.",

            "Honestly, going to events you\u2019re interested in by yourself can work! I made a new friend going to a listening party for a K-Pop album back in the fall and here we are like 9 months later going to concerts and hanging out!",

            "I\u2019d say that\u2019s not the general rule. I know plenty of people who have just a few close friends. Try to avoid the FOMO when you see groups like that, because you don\u2019t know how close or friendly they are. Live your life the best you can by making some meaningful connections."
