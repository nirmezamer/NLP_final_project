They're trying to shut me down because they say if I keep fishing, there won't be any fish left.' Can you believe that folks? Unbelievable. Never forget that the deep state wants to take away your freedom. They want to take your fish, and those beautiful birds they kill with their windmills - you know the ones, they make that horrible sound - and they want to take your air conditioning and your showers - you know how they just drip drip drip they don't want you to be able to wash that soap off your bodies because it might hurt the fish.\"",
