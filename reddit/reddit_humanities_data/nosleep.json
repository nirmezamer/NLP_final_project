        "content": "I had heard a knock on the door.\n\nBut when I opened it\u2026\n\n\u2026No one was there.\n\nI looked around...\n\n...Nothing.\n\nThen I looked down...\n\n...And saw it.\n\nLying there on the doorstep, was an old cell phone with a cracked screen.\n\nI picked it up and clicked the home button.\n\nIt opened without a passcode, revealing a home screen with only one app.\n\n\"Rebecca?\" I called out to my eighteen year old daughter, as I stepped back inside and closed the door behind me. \"You know anything about the cell phone I just found on the doorstep?\"\n\n\"On the doorstep?\" She called back from the living room, likely scrolling away on her own phone.\n\n\"Yeah, with a big crack in it?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"I guess I'll just throw it out then.\"\n\n\"Wait! I wanna see!\" She cried out, her curiosity peaked, as she made her way over to the kitchen.\n\nI held it up for her to see.\n\n\"Ew. Looks old. Like from when you and mom were growing up.\"\n\n\"When your mom and I were growing up, there were no cell phones, Becca.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was. Perfectly boring. In the best way possible. Now look at what's become of the world.\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, let me see it.\" She said, snatching the old cracked cell phone out my hand. \"What's the passcode?\"\n\n\"There isn't one.\"\n\nShe opened it.\n\n\"Just one app? This phone is so mid.\"\n\n\"Mid?\" I asked, unfamiliar with her Gen-Z slang.\n\n\"It means like mediocre, dad. Where'd you find this thing, anyway?\"\n\n\"I told you, on the doorstep. Someone knocked and ran away.\"\n\n\"So it's some sort of prank?\"\n\n\"If it is, it's a pretty mid prank.\" I replied, giving her the same smug look I always did when I landed a dad joke.\n\n\"Ew, your jokes are not funny, Dad. Anyways, I'm gonna see what's in the app.\" Rebecca said, as she scurried off back to the living room, and proceeded to scroll away on the cracked old phone.\n\n\"Cool, let me know what you find, Becca.\" I said casually, as I sat back down at the dinner table and continued reading my newspaper.\n\nAn hour or so later, my wife Erica returned home from work, and we had dinner.\n\n\"Rebecca, it's dinner time!\" Erica called out from the kitchen.\n\nBut my daughter didn't reply.\n\n\"Becca?\" I added.\n\nBut again, Rebecca ignored us.\n\nMy wife and I both looked at each other and rolled our eyes.\n\n\"Your loss! Food'll be cold again.\" Erica said, referring to the countless other times our social media-obsessed teen had forgone dinner so long that the meal had become cold.\n\n\"Kids.\" I muttered under my breath. \"So how was work, honey?\"\n\n\u2014\n\nA few hours later, my wife and I decided to go upstairs for the night and, seeing that Rebecca was still scrolling away on the couch, reminded her that her dinner was on the table.\n\nOnce again, our daughter just ignored us, as she continued to scroll away on her phone. Something that, after raising an eighteen year old daughter, I was very used to.\n\nBut this time, something was different. This time, she was scrolling on a different phone. The old cracked phone I had found on the doorstep, to be precise.\n\n*She's still using that old thing? Wonder what app was on there? Must be some game or social media thing.* I thought to myself.\n\n\"Just remember to turn the lights out before you go to bed, Becca.\" My wife called down, before we retired to our bedroom, to no reply.\n\n\u2014\n\nBut the next morning, not only did we find the lights on, but we also found Rebecca still sitting there. Sure enough, scrolling away on the old cracked phone.\n\n\"Rebecca!\" My wife called out. \"Did you even sleep last night?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Becca, you really shouldn't be pulling all nighters like that.\" I added, as I went to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee.\n\nBut before I could make it that far, something caught my eye on the kitchen table.\n\nTo my disbelief, there was Rebecca's dinner. Still sitting there. Completely untouched.\n\nThat's when I knew...\n\n...That something was very wrong.\n\n\u2014\n\nBy the time my wife and I were able to pry the old cracked cell phone out of our daughter's hands, Rebecca had gone into a sudden fit of rage.\n\n\"Give it back!\" She screamed, her eyes cold and lifeless.\n\nI tossed the phone to Erica behind me, while I stood between her and our daughter.\n\n\"I said, give it back!\" Rebecca screamed again, in a threatening fashion.\n\n\"Becca, what's gotten into you? It's just an old phone. And a cracked one at that-\" I began.\n\nBut before I could continue, my innocent daughter, who had never laid a finger on a soul her entire life, suddenly lunged at me, swung her arm, and ran her nails across my face, tearing the flesh from my skin and causing blood to pour down my neck.\n\n\"Rebecca!\" I yelled, raising my voice.\n\nBut it was too late. She had already hopped over me and chased my wife into the kitchen.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhen I finally caught up to her at the entrance to the kitchen, I saw my daughter standing there with a steak knife, on one side of the kitchen table, while my wife stood on the other, shaking in fear, as she held the old cracked phone in her hand.\n\n\"What was on that app?\" I asked hypothetically out loud, realizing that whatever my daughter had discovered on the phone, must have been the cause of her fourteen hour doomscroll and subsequent fit of rage.\n\nBut Erica must have taken me literally, immediately opening the phone and going to the app.\n\nI saw a perplexed look wash over my wife's face, as she took her finger, placed it on the phone's cracked surface, and started to scroll.\n\n\"Nooo! Erica, stop!\" I cried out, as I ran over to her, and ripped the phone from her hand.\n\nBut before I could even process what had happened, I heard the steak knife that my daughter was holding fall to the kitchen floor, before she too collapsed to the ground.\n\n\"Becca?\" I asked, confused by her sudden change of disposition, but at the same time, relieved that her fit of rage had ceased.\n\nThat's when I heard a growl behind me, as my daughter's rage had somehow shifted to my wife, and Erica picked up the knife from the floor.\n\n\"Give. It. Back!\" My wife screamed, her eyes now cold and lifeless.\n\nI looked down at my daughter, who looked as if she had just awoken from a trance.\n\nThat's when I realized that whatever curse had been bestowed upon the old cracked phone's app, seemed to only affect the last person who used it.\n\nI took my dazed daughter by the hand, and led her out of the kitchen, out of the house, and to the driveway, as my wife followed, still wielding the knife.\n\n\"Get in!\" I insisted, as I opened my car door, and Rebecca hopped inside, before I used my key fob to lock her inside.\n\n\"Give me the phone!\" My wife cried from behind me, as she swung the knife at me.\n\nI stepped aside, and watched its blade pierce the hood of my car.\n\nI thought to call out my wife's name, in an attempt to snap her out of it, but immediately realizing that there was only one way to snap her out of her trance.\n\nAs she struggled to pull the blade out of the car, I seized the opportunity to run back in the house and turn on the sink in the first floor bathroom.\n\nEventually, my wife came back inside looking for me and, sure enough, headed for the source of the running water.\n\nAnd when she stepped inside, I hopped out from behind the kitchen island, slamming the door behind her, before dragging a nearby bookshelf against the door and reinforcing it with a few other heavy objects.\n\n\"Give me the phone!\" I heard her cry out from inside the bathroom, as I looked at the old cracked cell phone that I was still gripping in my hand, and knew what I had to do.\n\n\u2014\n\nThirty minutes later, the deed was done.\n\nThe old cracked cell phone, left on a random neighbor's doorstep in the next town over, where I hoped no one would recognize me.\n\nWhen I got back to the car, my daughter was just sitting there in the passenger seat, still traumatized and speechless from what she had just gone through.\n\nWe drove home in silence.\n\nAnd when we finally got back, we waited by the barricaded bathroom door, as my wife continued to scream.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nUntil eventually...\n\n...She stopped.\n\nI slid the heavy objects and bookshelf aside and opened the bathroom door, to find Erica just standing there, as if waking from a bad dream, the same exhausted expression on her face that I'd seen previously on my daughter.\n\nIt had worked. My wife was no longer possessed by the vile device.\n\nErica walked over and hugged me.\n\nI looked over at my daughter.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nI smiled back.\n\nIn that moment, two things became clear.\n\nOne, someone else had been possessed by the phone prior to leaving it on my doorstep.\n\nTwo, someone new was possessed by it now.\n\nBut all that mattered to me in that moment\u2026\n\n\u2026Was that my family was okay.\n\nI wish I could say that after the dust settled, my daughter swore off cell phones, social media, and apps altogether.\n\nBut the truth is, it only took a day before she was back to doomscrolling on her own phone.\n\nNow every time she does, and her dinner gets cold, I can't help but fear that she's been possessed again, but then I realize...\n\n...She's just a teenager.",

        "content": "He was always so petrified. He used to climb into bed with my wife and me every night. \u201cMummy, Daddy, I\u2019m afraid of the dark.\u201d This had become a routine. We tried everything\u2014lying in bed with him until he fell asleep, night lights, teddy bears\u2014nothing worked. I tried to convince my wife on many occasions to just let him sleep with us at night, but she refused and said it was a phase; we had to be consistent.\n\nThis habit broke when we decided to move from our two-bedroom flat into our first real home. We had been saving for this home for almost ten years, and it was everything we had dreamed of: real wood flooring, rooms so spacious that if you yelled, it would echo, and a huge back garden. The first night we went to bed, I was sure our son would climb into bed with us. I was stunned when we didn\u2019t wake up until 9am, and he was still asleep.\n\nI sat at the table, sipping my morning coffee and reading the paper when he came toddling downstairs.\n\u201cGood morning, buddy! I see you slept all night in your big boy bed by yourself!\u201d I couldn\u2019t contain my excitement. It may sound ridiculous, but I was worried this would go on forever.\n\nHe let out a little chuckle, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Daddy, I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d\n\nI was instantly confused. Did my wife sneak into his room and sleep with him? Did he get into our bed and then go back in the morning? \u201cWhat do you mean, son? I didn\u2019t hear you once.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend was with me,\u201d he said with a huge grin on his face. \u201cDaddy, can I watch Bluey while eating breakfast this morning?\u201d he innocently asked, giving puppy dog eyes.\n\n\u201cNo, son, we\u2019ve just got that sofa, and I don\u2019t want it covered in eggs.\u201d Suddenly, what he had said a moment before dawned on me. \u201cSon, what friend?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\n\n\u201cMy friend!\u201d he smiled. \u201cPlease, Dad! I won\u2019t get eggs anywhere, I promise!\u201d he begged.\n\n\u201cNot today, little one, your mum would go crazy at me. Maybe tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAwhhh,\u201d he frowned, slumping down at the table. He began munching his breakfast, eating as fast as he could so he wouldn\u2019t miss the new episode.\n\nLater that day, I spoke to my wife and told her about what our child had said earlier. She told me not to overthink it; if anything, it\u2019s a good thing that he has an imaginary friend, especially if it helps him go to sleep. I agreed and continued with his bedtime routine.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it when I woke up, and he wasn\u2019t sandwiched between us for the second night in a row. Again, I went downstairs to have my coffee and read my newspaper. Suddenly, he came flying down the stairs. \u201cDaddy, can we go to the park today?\u201d he said, as if he had just come up with the greatest idea ever.\n\n\u201cOf course we can,\u201d I laughed slightly, \u201cespecially since you slept all alone again.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, confused. \u201cDaddy, I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m not alone. My friend is with me.\u201d\n\nI decided to entertain him. \u201cOh yeah? What does this friend look like?\u201d\n\nHis face brightened up again. \u201cI can\u2019t see much of his face because he only comes out of the wardrobe when it\u2019s dark. He has a big smile and long fingernails. He taps them on the edge of the bed to help me sleep.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I was slightly disturbed. That sounded terrifying to me, but kids are imaginative and say all kinds of crazy things. \u201cWow, he sounds cool. What\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me not to tell you,\u201d he sang in a cheeky way, as if he thought it was funny that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in on the secret.\n\n\u201cCome on, tell me, and I\u2019ll let you watch Bluey while you eat your breakfast today,\u201d I smirked, thinking I had won the war.\n\n\u201cReally?!\u201d he exclaimed. Then suddenly, he paused. His face went blank. He turned around and looked towards the ajar coat room that was in the hallway separating the kitchen and living room. He turned back around, lowered his head, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, Daddy,\u201d he said, sounding rather disappointed.\n\nHe hopped up to the kitchen table, looking defeated, and started eating his toast. I won\u2019t lie\u2014I got kind of freaked out. I peered into the hallway, into the cloakroom; nothing seemed amiss. It was dark, as it needed a lightbulb, but nothing out of the ordinary. My wife\u2019s words ran through my head: this was a good thing.\n\nThat night, he was rather tuckered out from his day at the park. My wife and I were excited to have a full night together and were going to make the most of it, eating junk food in bed while watching a movie\u2014something we hadn\u2019t been able to do since our son was born. Suddenly, all the fizzy pop hit me, and I got up to go to the bathroom. I hopped out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. I thought maybe I\u2019d check on our little man and his \u201cfriend\u201d on the way. I placed my hand on the door knob, and my blood ran cold. Before I got a chance to open the door, I heard tap, tap, tap. It sounded just like nails on wood.",

        "content": "A couple of years ago, I went on vacation with a couple of friends of mine. My friend Kelly came from a place called Chatter Blinds up in New England. While her family had long since moved out, they kept a summer home in the area. Small-town living in a place down by the coast? Sign me up.\n\nThere were four of us in total. Kelly, who arranged the whole thing, was a work friend of mine. Then there was Marie. I didn\u2019t know her very well, but she and Kelly went way back \u2013 to the point where they could probably finish each other\u2019s sentences. Finally, there was Annie. I didn\u2019t know her all that well, but I\u2019d seen her around the office a couple of times. Apparently she was related to Marie somehow, but I hadn\u2019t bothered to ask how.\n\nSo on a late Thursday afternoon, we headed for a New England Labor Day-weekend.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChatter Blinds is a peculiar town, just past Brunswick. The place is along the coast and houses (at most) a couple of hundred people. Most of it looks sort of frozen in the 1970\u2019s, and you can tell by the sun-beaten signs that not a lot has changed since then.\n\nWe made our way to the old summer home at the edge of town. It was the kind of place where you needed firewood to keep warm in the winter, and where your water might suddenly run out. There was a well on the property. Electricity was spotty at best, and there was a massive wasp nest hanging from the southwestern corner of the roof.\n\nStill, it was exactly what we bargained for. Cheap country living.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOur stay there took some time getting used to, but by Friday night we were having a blast. We took a rowboat out to a sauna on a small island and had margaritas. We spent Saturday touring the town and having a bite to eat at the local pub. We met one of the local fishermen who offered to take us out on a trip on Sunday, which we all heartily agreed to. Subsequently, Sunday turned out great. Sure, we had to get up early, but we were feasting on freshly smoked lobster by the end of the day.\n\nWe were having a bit of trouble though. There were a couple of locals who weren\u2019t all enthused about a bunch of metropolitan women coming to see their town, so we had to endure more than a handful of nasty comments. They were just stupid kids, but it was definitely the worst part of the trip. There was this one blonde kid with a white shirt that just refused to stop smirking at us. His baby sister, aged 10 or 12, didn\u2019t seem all too enthused either.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Sunday rolled around, we were ready to go home. Before we did, Kelly decided to give us a final tour. Marie remarked on something peculiar; that there was no church in town.\n\n\u201cTowns like this always got a church,\u201d she commented. \u201cIt\u2019s just strange, is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the bedrock,\u201d Kelly commented. \u201cMost of the town is built on solid bedrock.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo just build a church on the bedrock.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have a *graveyard* built on bedrock,\u201d Kelly shrugged. \u201cMost folks who died back in the day were shipped off to either Brunswick or Wiscasset.\u201d\n\nKelly stopped for a moment, considering something. Checking her phone, she nodded.\n\n\u201cWe got time,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou gotta see this one last thing. The casket cellar.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe took us to the north side of town. We followed a dirt road into the woods, where there was this bulging dirt mound. Not just like a pile, but like, a small structure. It was clearly man-made but hadn\u2019t been used in decades. It was covered in wildflowers in this perfect circle, like a place of worship. There was a solid oak door in the middle of it. The road was severely overgrown with weeds and fallen trees, showing just how few people went out of their way to see this place. A couple of rusted-out logging machines lay to the side. Just looking at them made me feel like I needed a tetanus shot.\n\n\u201cThis is one of few patches of land around that isn\u2019t just solid rock,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt was too small to build a graveyard, but they figured they could make a kind of storage.\u201d\n\n\u201cA storage for what?\u201d Annie squinted at her.\n\n\u201cFor a while it was logging stuff, but back in the day it was dead folks. Like a\u2026 you know. A temporary thing before the bodies were shipped off north.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like a\u2026 cooler. A cellar,\u201d said Marie.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly nodded. \u201cPeople don\u2019t use it anymore, but it\u2019s sort of a\u2026 morbid local curio.\u201d\n\nWe all fell silent for a moment. Kelly turned to me with the biggest grin.\n\n\u201cWanna check it out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOf course we wanted to see it. We were four women in our mid-30\u2019s hopped up on true crime podcasts and Stephen King novels. This was the sort of thing that gave me the goosebumps; I\u2019d never heard of anything like it. A body cellar? Sick.\n\nThe door took some convincing to open, but we managed to squeeze through. The air was damp and cool; much colder than expected. Using our phones as flashlights, we walked down a narrow set of stone steps, deeper into the ground.\n\nThe cellar was about 9 by 9 feet and we had to crouch not to hit our heads on the ceiling at times. The ground was solid bedrock, but the walls were a combination of propped-up planks, and deep dirt holes. They reminded me of the wasp nest back at the house, where you could see these deep chambers built into it. It was the same here; about a dozen holes in the wall, going deep into the dirt.\n\nOf course, there was nothing there. The place hadn\u2019t been used for decades, maybe even a century. There was some kind of opening, somewhere, as I could feel a puff of cold air going through the room, but I couldn\u2019t see any ventilation or opening. To add to the ambience, Kelly decided to light an oil lamp she found in the corner. We were a bit skeptical, but it seemed to work well enough. She hung it on a hook in the middle of the room.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe light flickered a little as we turned off our flashlights and looked around the room. There were these small notches in every hole where caskets were once slid in. There were tools along the lefthand wall. Things like hooks to drag the bodies out. Hammers and rusted nails to fix broken casket lids. Masks to shield workers from swarms of flies.\n\nEvery item told a story, and once you put it all together, it painted a grim picture. This place had been something real and sorrowful. This wasn\u2019t a tourist attraction; it was a remnant of a grim reality. This was a place of necessity, not curiosity.\n\nI felt a little bad about it and suggested we leave. Marie and Kelly wanted to take a couple of pictures, so they asked me to help. They sat down by the edge of one of the holes and pretended to look scared. I took a couple of photos while Marie giggled about having a new Tinder pic. I wasn\u2019t amused \u2013 it was too morbid. That cellar was\u2026 uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe turned to leave, hurrying up the stairs. Annie was first. As she reached the door and pushed on it, she stopped. She pushed again, and again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 hold on\u2026\u201d\n\nShe tried a couple more times but couldn\u2019t get it to budge. She switched places with Kelly, who was the more athletically gifted of us. Kelly gave it a proper shoulder-push, but the door didn\u2019t move an inch. She gave it another push, a kick, and an impressive effort \u2013 but it didn\u2019t move. Then I heard something.\n\nGiggling.\n\nIt was those goddamned kids. They\u2019d locked us in and put something against the door. Annie yelled at them to let us out, or we\u2019d press charges. That just made them giggle more. It didn\u2019t take long until we could hear them leave, with a faint \u201cBye!\u201d echoing off in the distance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Kelly and Marie took turns punishing the door, Annie and I tried to get a signal on our phones. Even at the very top of the stairs, we were still underground and off the grid. This place was isolated, and we couldn\u2019t get a signal through.\n\nKelly and Marie came back down dripping with sweat. Annie was curled up in a corner, trying not to panic. There was no doubt about it. We were stuck, for the time being. Maybe someone would pass by and let us out.\n\nKelly tried to use some of the tools to break the door, but it didn\u2019t work. The hammers were termite-ridden, and the handles were falling apart. There was a saw, but the blade was rusted straight through. There were hooks for dragging out caskets, but these were useless when it came to breaking doors or hinges.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe were stuck down there for a couple of hours. Things were getting dark outside, and we could feel a wind growing colder. Annie was having some sort of panic attack and had resorted to desperately pounding on the door \u2013 screaming for help. The rhythmic thumping and yelling were boring into my brain, to the point where I could still hear it in the quiet moments where she stopped. Kelly had run her phone battery dry trying to find a spot with a signal. Marie had just fully given up and collapsed against the wall, taking a stress-induced nap.\n\nThe oil lamp was still burning strong. Kelly had tried to set the door on fire, but it just wouldn\u2019t catch on. The air was too damp, and it only resulted in smoke blowing down into the cellar. It seemed that no matter how hard we tried, we couldn\u2019t MacGyver ourselves out of this one anytime soon. It was getting annoying since we all had work in the morning, and we\u2019d have to drive late into the night to make it back on time at this rate.\n\nInevitably, we turned on one another. Blaming each other for provoking the locals, for not keeping the door open, for going there in the first place. Annie went on a long rant about how we all could\u2019ve gone to Aruba instead, where she had a half-sister who ran a bar. Marie had fully checked out at that point, turning from napping to silently weeping. There was no way we\u2019d be left there for long. If the kids had found us, others would too.\n\n\u201cWe just have to make sure we\u2019re heard,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe took turns pounding on the door, calling out for help. Even Marie joined in, although not as energetically as the rest of us. We rationed our water bottles, sharing what little we had between us. It went on and on for hours. Banging on the door. Call for help. Banging on the door. Call for help. Over, and over, and over. We were lucky that cellar was empty, or that kind of braindead monotony would be annoying enough to wake the dead.\n\nIt got colder a lot quicker as the sun set. There\u2019d already been an overcast during the day, so we figured it wouldn\u2019t be long until it started to rain. Maybe someone would come looking for us in the morning; the four of us not showing up for work ought to raise a few eyebrows.\n\nWe huddled together for warmth, watching the light of the oil lamp flicker back and forth. There was a cold chill reaching us, pulling me back from the brink of an exhausted sleep over and over.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt must\u2019ve been close to midnight when I looked up to see Annie standing in the middle of the room, staring down the holes in the wall. She was breathing heavy, as if trying to psych herself up. I squinted at her, trying to get the sleep out of my eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whispered, as to not wake the others.\n\n\u201cI heard something,\u201d she said. \u201cIn there.\u201d\n\nShe pointed straight into one of the hole. As she did, an icy wind swept through the cellar; swirling the dirt around and stinging my nose. Marie shuddered in her sleep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna look,\u201d said Annie. \u201cReal quick.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI got up and stood behind her. She crawled into the hole face-first. She could barely move, but I promised to pull her out by her feet if I had to. As she got to the back of the hole, I couldn\u2019t see anything but her shoes sticking out.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI think it\u2019s just some-\u201c\n\nShe stopped. Another wind passed through the room, this time a little stronger. The oil lamp swayed and fell off the hook, falling to the ground with a clunk. The flame went out as Marie and Kelly sprung awake. For a moment, everything went deathly quiet.\n\nI felt this strange sensation in my chest. Something tightening over my ribs, like my blood constricting. Something poking my heart to provoke it into racing.\n\n\u201cAnnie?\u201d I whispered.\n\nNothing.\n\nI picked the lamp up, lit it, and hung it back up. I could see her feet dangling at the edge of the hole, not moving an inch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen, she moved. A sudden lurch.\n\nHer legs motionless, moving further down the hole.\n\nAs if something was dragging her in, by the head.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI grabbed her foot and felt a tug on the other end. A sudden pull, and her shoe came off.\n\nThe hole went deeper than we thought. A lot deeper.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarie and Kelly panicked. Marie rushed up the stairs and resumed banging on the door while Kelly battled against her instincts to follow Annie into the hole. She poked her head in to look, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to go further; instead pulling at her own hair in frustration. I didn\u2019t even notice how I\u2019d stumbled backwards toward the opposite end of the room, flattening myself against the wall. It was\u2026 subconscious.\n\nAs Marie and Kelly panicked, running back and forth, all I could do was to look at Annie\u2019s shoe. It still lay there at the edge of the hole. The same hole we\u2019d used for a nice profile picture, earlier in the day.\n\nA stray thought hit me. I still had some battery left on my phone. Not much, but a little.\n\nAs the screams for help faded into screams for Annie, I fumbled through my photo album. I didn\u2019t even notice how much my fingers were shaking until I had to precision-tap which image to view, where I picked the wrong one at least three times.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, I brought up the picture of Kelly and Marie, standing in front of that hole. The flash had gone off, giving them a bit of an eerie glow. But it also allowed me to see straight into the hole behind them.\n\nThere were these ten white spots in the dirt, laid out in a sort of crescent semi-circle. They were too dull to be eyes, or glass. They weren\u2019t really reflective.\n\nMy mind wandered as I pondered the possibilities. My eyes blurred, looking away from the screen and down onto my dirty hands. My pale thumbs, holding the device in a cramp.\n\nLooking back at the picture, I couldn\u2019t help but to see a similarity.\n\nTwo sets of five, deep in the dirt.\n\nFingers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI took down the oil lamp and carefully moved up to the hole. Kelly and Marie joined me. We looked inside, only to see that the back end of the wall was gone. Instead, it was just this hole going deeper into the dirt at a slight tilt.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just an abandoned cellar. It was something\u2019s nest.\n\nWe all stopped to listen. Further in, almost as if coming from below our feet, we could hear a sound travel. The faint noise of fabric being torn. The pop of buttons coming off, and zippers being torn open. The shuffling of hair.\n\nThen, a sickening crunch.\n\nThe breaking of bones.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe backed away. Marie was having trouble breathing. Kelly tried to calm her down, carefully stroking her shoulders, hushing her. We spoke in whispers, leaving the oil lamp hanging in the middle of the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting out,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cWe have to wait until they find us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in there,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-we\u2026 we gotta get Annie out,\u201d sobbed Marie. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave her in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sticking my head in, and neither are any of you,\u201d Kelly snapped back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out, and we\u2019re getting help.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe all decided to try one thing each. Marie was going to check one of the other holes to see if there were any other tunnels, possibly leading outside. There was fresh air coming from somewhere, so there had to be some kind of connection to the surface. Kelly was going to block the hole where Annie had disappeared. We all collected our spare jackets, shoes, and backpacks; stuffing it in the hole along with any tools and debris we could find along the cellar.\n\nI was going to try and call for help again. There was a slight gap at the bottom of the door where I could slide the phone through. It might be just enough to get a bar. I used a long sleeve of plastic from a Slim Jim and put it under the phone, so I could drag it back in \u2013 carefully. I put the phone down, pressed to call, and slid it out; hoping those extra inches would be enough.\n\nIt briefly sounded like a call went through, but I couldn\u2019t hear anyone picking up. It was raining outside by now, and the sound drowned out everything else. There was cold water dripping through the door, staining the stone steps on the way down.\n\nWe weren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. By the time I dragged my phone back in, the battery was as dead as the rest of this place.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGoing back the stairs, I almost slipped. I caught my grip, but looked up at the surprised faces of Kelly and Marie, standing in the middle of the cellar.\n\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d Kelly asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore I got to respond, I saw something moving in one of the other holes. A forearm, almost three foot long, reaching out into the room. I pointed at it, screaming, just as another wind swept through the room; this time blowing out the flame of the oil lamp completely.\n\nThere was commotion.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell who screamed the most. Kelly, Marie, or me. Someone was in pain. One voice grew more distant, and suddenly stopped. A dragging noise dwarfed by panicked crying.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI touched the walls. I forced myself to think of my own body. I was unharmed. I was alright. But someone down there wasn\u2019t.\n\nThat was just it \u2013 down there. It was down there, not up the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up here,\u201d I whispered. \u201cUp the stairs.\u201d\n\nA quiet sobbing. Step by step, someone came up the stairs. The thought hit me that it might be none of them. It could be Annie. It could be whatever took her. There was no way to be sure, and with the last light snuffed out there was nothing to prevent my mind from filling in the blanks.\n\nAs a hand grabbed my leg, I screamed \u2013 startling poor Kelly, who was the one coming up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe made our way to the top of the stairs, pushing our backs against the door. We made ourselves small and tried to keep quiet. A sliver of light made its way through the cracks in the door. For a good half an hour or so, we just sat there, trying to find the courage to speak. Finally, Kelly whispered to me.\n\n\u201cI-it grabbed her ankle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt crept along the floor, and g-grabbed her ankle.\u201d\n\nInstinctively, I moved my feet up and hugged my knees close to my chest.\n\n\u201cDid you see it?\u201d I whispered back.\n\n\u201cJ-just the fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cI-it had really long fingers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy leg cramped up, and I stopped feeling anything in my toes. I couldn\u2019t move, and neither could Kelly. We could barely breathe. I tried to listen past the pitter-patter of rain, but there was nothing coming from downstairs. Instead, my mind filled in the blanks \u2013 imagining all kinds of noises. I could almost hear the way Annie pounded on the door, calling for help. I could hear Marie\u2019s gentle weeping. And if I let my mind stray just a little bit too far, I could hear the snapping of bones, and the ripping of fabric.\n\nMy pulse was racing so hard it hurt my head, making me bob my neck back and forth like a fish out of water. Kelly didn\u2019t say a word. We just held each other close, waiting second by second for dawn to come.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt must\u2019ve been\u2026 an hour, maybe two, before I heard something.\n\nThere was a shuffling noise outside, on the other side of the door. I perked up to listen, and Kelly did the same. Footsteps \u2013 someone walking by. I saw the outline of Kelly\u2019s face as we looked at one another, quietly contemplating our options.\n\nThen, a voice.\n\n\u201c\u2026are you still in there?\u201d\n\nA young girl, maybe 10 or 12. We\u2019d seen her run with the local kids.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kelly whispered back. \u201cYou need to go get help. Call the police. And you need to open the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d the girl sighed. \u201cThe chipper they put there is real heavy. I can\u2019t-\u201c\n\n\u201cThen you need to go get help!\u201d Kelly roared. \u201cRight now!\u201d\n\nThe girl took off immediately. For what purpose, we couldn\u2019t tell. Maybe she was gonna get help. Maybe she got scared off. We didn\u2019t know. Either way, she was gone.\n\nAnd shortly after, there was a sound coming from downstairs. A chill wind blowing through the cellar carrying a strange, musty scent.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe tensed up. I held my breath. A light tip-tap of something poking against the stone steps. Then, nothing.\n\nI looked at Kelly and held her hand.\n\nThen she was pulled down.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was quick. She held onto my wrist like her life depended on it, and I slid down three steps. I held onto her and pulled, but the force at the other end was too strong. She kicked and screamed like a wounded animal, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, something came loose, and she scampered back up the stairs.\n\nPushing ourselves against the door, I could see her foot was bleeding. Her shoe had come off, and at least two toes were broken at a strange angle. There were marks along the middle of her foot. Bite marks. I could see the imprint of human molars on her big toe.\n\nWe huddled against the door. Kelly\u2019s eyes were wide with panic, scratching at the wood until her acrylic nails came off.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for it to return. A long white arm making its way up the stairs. A hand tip-tapping against the stone steps like a spider. And far down into the dark, I could see three pairs of eyes reflecting the sliver of moonlight coming through the door. Six eyes, parted into sets of two.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe threw our shoes. We kicked. We screamed. It retreated, only to try again, and again, and again. As soon as there was a moment of quiet, it came back \u2013 poking and prodding at our readiness.\n\nIn a moment of silence, Kelly and I just held one another. I eventually came to realize that there was a new sound coming from downstairs. It\u2019d been there for some time, but we\u2019d been too busy to notice it. A low rhythmic hum, like a deep cackle.\n\nA laugh.\n\nIt had stopped playing with us.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSeconds later, two arms shot out of the dark. One grabbing me by the hair, the other grabbing Kelly by the throat. We were immediately pulled down step, by step, by step. Within seconds, I could feel the floor as we reached the cellar. My hands fumbled for something to grab, only to feel the glass shards of the now-broken oil lamp next to me. Grabbing the largest shard I could, I let it sink into my palm as I stabbed what had grabbed me over, and over, and over.\n\nThe moment it let go, I dove for Kelly. I drove the shard into the pale white arm grabbing her, forcing it to let go. A dark blue kind of blood, thicker than jelly, pooled around the edge of the shard as both arms sunk back into the holes.\n\nKelly was barely breathing; struggling to get air past her neck. I grabbed her under her arms and tip-toed my way back up the stairs; only to see those white arms slowly coming back out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI couldn\u2019t survive another attack. It\u2019d be our last. I dragged Kelly back up the stairs, hoping against hope we\u2019d make it somehow. She kicked helplessly at the white fingers that poked at her wounded feet, teasing her. A reminder that it was going to get her next time.\n\nLaughter.\n\n\u201c\u2026no\u2026\u201d Kelly mumbled with what little breath she could muster. \u201c\u2026n-no\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe reached the top of the stairs. The arms grew closer. Nails tip-tapping against the stone steps.\n\nIt was joyful. Eager.\n\nExpectant.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI pressed my back against the door. If it came to it, I would have no choice but to drop Kelly. I had to do whatever it took to make it out. I remember coming to that conscious decision that if it came down to it, I\u2019d do it. I had to.\n\nThen, I lost my balance.\n\nThe door gave out from behind me as it opened.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI fell backwards, keeping Kelly in my arms. A sudden burst of moonlight lit up the hallway as a mound of pale limbs retreated into the dark.\n\nThe local kids had pulled an old rusted-out machine aside, unlodging the door.\n\nKelly coughed, crawling away from the entrance. To see a grown woman crawling through the dirt like that in a panicked weeping\u2026 I\u2019ll never get that image out of my head. Even the kids who\u2019d trapped us seemed shocked.\n\n\u201cW-we thought\u2026 we thought you could open it,\u201d one of them said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant t-to get stuck\u2026\u201d\n\nThe blonde kid with the white shirt. He wasn\u2019t smirking anymore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI just stayed there, in the rain. The palm of my hands slipping on a couple of trampled petals from a blue sunflower. I looked at the cellar, unblinking. Even then, despite the rain, and the excuses, and the weeping, I could hear the tip-tapping of nails against the stone steps. Something waited for us to slip up. For someone to look the other way.\n\nFor another chance to take it all away, in the blink of an eye.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis was a couple of years ago, as I mentioned. It was all written up as an animal attack, but there wasn\u2019t even an attempt to elaborate. Just an animal attack. The local sheriff ordered the place permanently closed, so they just filled it up with gravel and dirt.\n\nThey never recovered Marie or Annie. They never even said what happened to them.\n\nKelly had to amputate part of her foot, but was otherwise fine. But she, like me, wasn\u2019t going to be the same ever again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why I sleep with the lights on, and something playing on my laptop. As soon as the dark gets too dark, or the silence gets too loud, my mind fills in the blanks with something from that night. The weeping. The banging on the door. The tip-tapping of nails against stone.\n\nAnd I will have to do what it takes to drown that out.\n\nFor the rest of my life.",

I wasn\u2019t going to give that asshole any further advantage than he already had over me. I quickly entered the stairwell full of rotting corpses and sprinted up the stairs. I wasn\u2019t going to bother going up to the 11th floor again, since he probably would think that I\u2019d be dumb enough or panicked enough to consider doing that. Instead, I got off on the 6th floor and quickly sprinted towards the closest room. Taking my phone out and using it as a flashlight to illuminate the pitch darkness I turned the doorknob to see if this room was opened. It wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI quickly whipped my backpack around and pulled out my lockpicking tool; making quick work of the door even though I was working with only two working fingers on my left hand. I entered the now unlocked hotel room and slammed the door behind me. I wasn\u2019t planning on hiding there however, I had a better plan. I quickly began to make a mess of the hotel room, ripping the sheets off and kicking up a mountain of decades-old dust into the air. I yanked the comforter off of the queen-sized bed and next went about picking the side door into the next-door hotel room.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis door also met the same fate as the last one and I quickly ran inside, surrounded by my new comforter. I quickly exited the second room and made a v-line towards the ice machine and the vending machines. I had a hunch that a hotel this old and abandoned had to have an ice machine that was large enough for me to fit in. And to my immense relief there indeed was one large enough for me to climb into. Even though this hotel was supposed to be abandoned I was still confused as to how everything still seemed to work, including the electricity. But I wasn\u2019t in the habit of thinking too deeply about it, as I quickly wrapped the comforter around me and climbed into the still-working and freezing ice box, shutting my phone off and plunging me into darkness.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI shivered a bit as I got myself situated and waited for the ice to stop making noise as it also settled in around me and my protective blanket. Maybe even if Mirror Creole was able to find me the blanket would protect me from any attack he might make on me. Wishful thinking sure, but I needed any comfort that I could get. I waited in the ice machine waiting to see when my five-minute head start would be done. I didn\u2019t have long to wait.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cReady or not, here I come.\u201d Creole\u2019s voice whispered in my ears, causing me to flinch and look behind me to see if he had somehow appeared behind me in the confined space. Even though he wasn\u2019t there I quickly shivered uncontrollably. Both because of the freezing temperatures and because the game had officially begun.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wrapped the blanket around me as tightly as I could and waited to see what would happen. I had an hour to survive, and if I did, I would be free of him. Even though an hour might seem short I felt every single second tick by as I began to flinch at every single noise that happened. Every single ice cube that fell next to me caused my heart to nearly beat out of my chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA few minutes later but what felt like six days later I heard the stairwell door open. I froze so tightly that I could probably have passed for an ice cube as I tried to listen to see if I could hear Mirror Creole walk around the hall. But judging by the fact that I couldn\u2019t even hear mirror me\u2019s footsteps when she was chasing me, I doubted if I was going to be able to hear his. But what I did manage to hear was a few doors being opened and closed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt sounded like whoever was doing it was just quickly popping in and closing the door soon after. That certainly didn\u2019t seem like something the mirror creatures would do. Because they were much more likely to just bust the door down in their attempt at finding me. After a few more doors I heard footsteps approaching and I didn\u2019t so much as move a muscle. And then to my horror, the door to the ice machine was opened, but before I could do anything a hand was placed on my mouth.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy eyes adjusted from the pitch black as a lantern was shone into my face. I stared up at the button eyes and permanent smile of Jacob. I quickly let out a torrent of muffled obscenities at him. I was filled with so much anger, fear, and rage that they all boiled together when I finally laid eyes on him again. He had nearly tried to kill me just a few moments ago in Creole\u2019s shop and now here he was probably about to sell me out to his boss.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInstead, he quickly held a finger up to his smiling face and quickly pointed towards a corner. I followed his gaze and was shocked to see that a part of my comforter had been sticking out of the ice machine. He quickly stuffed the blanket completely into the ice machine and looked around him before finally removing his hand from my mouth.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumbled to him, still not fully trusting him after he had so nearly eaten me back at the shop. He nodded quickly and again looked around before handing me some hand warmers and slowly closing the ice machine lid. I heard his footsteps quickly walk away and become faint as he seemingly left to continue the search for me. I stared down at the hand warmers and gave them a little shake as I again settled back down into the blanket and the ice cubes surrounding me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after Jacob left that I heard loud thumping coming from not too far away. And more horrifyingly, soft singing. It was faint at first but it slowly grew louder as I guessed the Mirror Creole was enjoying his hunt.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever laugh, as a hearse goes by. For you may be the next to die,\u201d he sang as I heard soft clacking against the surface of the ceiling. He was crawling on the ceiling just like the mirror me had done. I involuntarily shivered as I imagined that lanky bastard crawling around on the ceiling. He continued singing as he came to a stop just near the ice machine. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was scanning around or if he already knew where I was and was just taunting me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe worms crawl in, the worms crawl out. The worms play pinochle on your snout. They eat your eyes, they eat your nose, as you begin to decompose,\u201d he continued to sing as his voice grew louder with every lyric. It was here that my nose began to betray me. All the dust that I had kicked up had made itself at him in my nose and I suddenly needed to sneeze more than I ever had in my life. I quickly raised my fingers to cover my nose to prevent anything from escaping but in doing so I caused some ice cubes to move.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe singing came to an abrupt stop and so did my heart. There was no way he\u2019d heard the sound of the ice cubes moving. Was there? My question was soon answered when I heard something drop down from the ceiling. I had held my breath so long that it felt like my lungs were about to burst from lack of air. Just as I was sure I was about to be torn to shreds, a loud crash rang out from down the hall.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuddenly Mirror Creole took off toward the sound of the crash. I waited for him to get far enough away from me before exiting the ice machine as quietly as I could, abandoning my blanket in the machine and quickly crawling on the floor to be as quiet as possible in the dark void. I crawled my way towards the stairwell and was happy to see that just like the mirror me, Mirror Creole had broken the door. I quickly ducked into the stairwell and ran up to the 7th floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSilently exiting into the hallway I quickly turned my phone on to be able to see what I was getting into. With the adrenaline winding down I now realized how absolutely cold I was. It seemed the comforter had not been enough to keep me warm. Shivering uncontrollably I quickly ducked into another hotel room and as silently as possible entered the room. I shivered softly as I quickly ducked underneath the dusty covers trying to get warm again.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was almost tempted to turn the shower on to see if I could get some hot water going, but my instinct to survive this game was far and above my need to warm up. It took me a few more minutes to warm up and when I wasn\u2019t as cold I quickly exited the bed and began to look around for a hiding spot. All of them however were blaring obvious. The closet, under the bed, and in the bathroom, were all too obvious and would be probably found instantly. The ice machine had been my best bet but now that Mirror Creole probably already knew I had been hiding there, he\u2019d most likely check all the other machines.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do I do?\u201d I wondered aloud to myself. Sure this place had plenty of floors but all of them had the same things a hundred times over. And all Mirror Creole had to do was get lucky once and it would be my complete doom. I entertained the idea of hiding on the first floor but I was sure that regular Creole would be waiting for me down there. The first floor had better options, the kitchen, the laundry room, etc. But now I was trapped in the upper floors, with only a long game of hide and seek to look forward to.\u00a0\n\n\n\nElecting to keep moving, I began picking the connecting doors to each hotel room for an easier escape if I crossed paths with Mirror Creole. All this picking was great practice for me as by now it felt like I had always only had two working fingers on my left hand. As I entered another room I ventured into the bathroom to look at myself. I stared at myself with my only good eye and lifted my hand to touch the empty void where my other eye had been. I hated how I looked, and this was with the ointment that hid the fact that a good chunk of my face was missing. I walked over to the bed and tore one of the pillow covers up into a strip long enough to cover up my eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I was done tying the makeshift eyepatch onto my face I suddenly was alerted to the singing again. And it was close. Tying the eyepatch on tightly I quickly ducked into the next room and looked around for any type of hiding space. The best spot I could come up with was behind a big sofa chair in the corner of the room. Honestly taking the head off a lamp and pretending I was a lamp would\u2019ve probably been better but in my panic. I quickly ducked behind the chair as the singing grew louder, quickly shutting my phone off.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the worms crawl out, the worms crawl in. The worms that crawl in are lean and thin, the ones that crawl out are fat and stout. Your eyes fall in and your hair falls out,\u201d he sang as I watched from the corner as a long arm reached out from above the door frame and dug its long claws into the ceiling before pulling itself into the room. This Creole was an absolute nightmare to look at. He put the version of me that came out of the mirror to shame. He was absolutely giant as he crawled gingerly across the ceiling like some enormous horrible stick bug. Creole was already tall, over six feet tall but this Creole was almost a good ten feet tall as he crawled around on the ceiling searching for me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaaaaaace, daaaaaaarling?\u201d he croaked as his singing came to an end and he scanned his button eyes around the room. I held my my hands over my mouth and nose to not let even the tinniest bit of breath out of my mouth. Nightmare Creole looked around the room before digging his feet into the ceiling and hanging down from it like some kind of giant emaciated bat. My eye did its best to adjust to the darkness to make out what he was doing from behind the sofa chair.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy eye widened in fear as I saw what he was doing. He opened his mouth up wide and I watched as one by one the stitches keeping his mouth together ripped open. But what happened next almost caused me to scream my lungs out. I watched in disgust as he began spitting giant rats out of his mouth and down onto the floor. I didn\u2019t see them at first, but I heard the horrible gagging sound he was making and the loud squeaking of the rats as they quickly began to scatter around the room.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe was trying to get me to exit my hiding spot. And he almost succeeded when one of the rats he vomited from his mouth came squeaking over to me and walked across my lap. I quickly closed my eye and did my best to ignore it as I felt its feet and tail drag across my legs. I tried to focus on the giant rat that I had killed at the high school. These little things were nothing compared to that thing, I kept reassuring myself. But the thing about phobias is that you can be as rational as you want to be, butt the end of the day, you\u2019re still terrified of the thing you have a phobia for.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuddenly I heard the room\u2019s door open and the room was flooded with light. I was sure that I was about to be spotted when Nightmare Creole hissed and quickly scampered away from the light source. He really was like some sort of giant bug.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Trying to send me on another wild goose chase?\u201d he hissed at who I assumed was Jacob. I ventured a peek to see what was happening and was instantly regretful when I did so. Seeing Nightmare Creole in more light was simply terrifying as he hung from the ceiling. I gazed over at Jacob as he held up the blanket I had used in the ice machine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSo she was in one of them,\u201d Nightmare Creole croaked in glee as he dropped down to the floor and began to intensely sniff at the blanket, causing me to throw up in my mouth at the sight. Jacob dropped the blanket and made a few gestures toward Nightmare Creole which I assumed was his way of communicating with the monster. The monster nodded before hunching down to make it through the entrance and suddenly taking off down the hall at full speed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI poked myself fully out of the corner and quickly flicked and kicked the rats away from me, making internal screaming sounds as I quickly ran over to Jacob. He quickly hugged me and closed the door as he entered the room with me. I shoved my face into his chest and panted, the phobia catching up with me a the rats squeaked around me and Jacob. He patted my head and offered me the lantern, and when I took it I was quickly scooped up by him and we quickly went into the room next door.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018How much longer do I have?\u201d I asked him as I held onto both him and the lantern. Jacob carefully placed me down on the bed and held up 3 fingers and none on his other hand. \u201c30 minutes?\u201d I asked him and received a nod from him. All of this had only been 30 minutes and I had another 30 minutes left to survive. I buried my face in my hands and let out an agonizing sigh. I felt like I\u2019d aged 40 years during this game.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do I do, Jacob?\u201d I asked him. He stared at me and then over to the door. I thought he wanted me to leave and run but I figured out that he was thinking. He took his red hat off and rubbed his hair deep in thought. He was actively trying to keep me alive. I plopped my face against his shoulder and pulled him closer to me. I wanted to at least enjoy this moment of peace and silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFinally, he carefully pushed me away and quickly stood up and rummaged through the desk. He pulled out a notepad and pen and quickly began scribbling something down. I half expected it to be another smiley face but was surprised to see that he was actually writing something. When he was done he showed me what he had written.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cKing Creole isn\u2019t on the first floor. Maybe you can find some places to hide down there?\u201d He had written and included a smiley face in the corner, getting a smile from me. But I was more concerned by the fact that Creole wasn\u2019t on the first floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know where he went?\u201d I asked him. To which he shook his head and offered me a shrug. I didn\u2019t like not knowing where Creole was. But if anything it seemed better to be captured by him than being captured by Nightmare Creole. I nodded and quickly took stock of everything I still had in my backpack. The gun and ammo were still there but I doubt they\u2019d do much for me. I nodded and quickly stood up. I handed Jacob the lantern before swinging my backpack back on.\n\n\n\n\u201cWish me luck,\u201d I told Jacob. Staring at his sickly grey face with that permanent smile, I couldn\u2019t help but kiss him on the cheek before quickly exiting the room and making my way toward the stairwell. I felt my face get hot thinking over what I had just done, but I had no time to think about that as I quickly ran down to the first floor, gagging at the smell of the twisted mangled corpses at the bottom.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt finally clicked in my head what those things were. They were mirror creatures, all of them tangled together with their giant limbs intertwined. I wondered how they\u2019d all ended up like that, but I needed to focus on not joining them. I carefully opened the door to the first floor and quietly exited into the hallway, making my way down toward the kitchen area. Turning my phone on so I would be able to see where I was going.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI made sure to look around more thoroughly so that I didn\u2019t miss anything in my now enormous blindspot. A part of me missed my eyes but the rest of me was happy to not be spied upon. As I entered the kitchen I quickly looked around for an area to hide in. The ovens were my first option but a part of me feared being trapped in there and baked alive. So my next best option was the walk-in freezer.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI walked over towards it and struggled with the door for a moment. It was jammed by something and took a good few tugs until it finally gave way. And to my horror when it did was met with the button eyes of Nightmare Creole staring back at me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI found you!\u201d He hissed and chuckled, reaching out to grab me. I acted quickly and slammed the door in his face, panting uncontrollably as I quickly ran away out of the kitchen. The sound of the heavy metal door hitting the floor clued me into the fact that he\u2019d escaped and was no doubt hot on my heels. I had to find either a place to hide or something to defend myself with. That was when I noticed that the gym was just down the hall. I sprinted towards it and was glad to find that it was open.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI quickly ducked into the room and looked around for something to defend myself with. Normal shitty hotels usually only have a treadmill and elliptical maybe a few exercise bikes. This one was nice enough to have dumbbells and kettlebells. I picked up one of the kettlebells and waited for Nightmare Creole. I didn\u2019t have long to wait as the lanky bastard came crawling into the gym after me. Crawling on all fours he stood up on his legs and I was astonished by how tall he was, he had to hunch over just to be able to stand up.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cEnd of the line, Mace,\u201d he hissed and giggled, licking his lips with a long slimy black tongue that caused me to involuntarily shudder in disgust. He slowly approached me, like a predator playing with a wounded animal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou sure about that, asshole?\u201d I asked him as I lifted the kettlebell and chucked it straight at him, hitting him square in the chest which cracked with a loud crunch that robbed the monster of all its air, it almost sounded like he was a deflating balloon. That staggered him and put him to the floor. I quickly reached over and grabbed a dumbbell before pouncing on him and tackling him to the ground. \u201cFuck you!\u201d I screamed as I began to crush his face with the dumbbell over and over.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe thrashed around like a bug on its back but instead of screaming or shouting, he was laughing as I began caving his skull in. This wasn\u2019t bothering him in the slightest, even with his head starting to look like ground beef. As I began to tire I was suddenly stabbed in the shoulder by his long claws. They dug in deep and he effortlessly flicked me away like I had been a bug that had landed on him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cFiesty thing,\u201d he said to me even though by the look of things he had no way of being able to speak to me. That was until, to my horror, all the damage I had done to his head began to reverse itself. Like a time-lapse in reverse his head was put back together as if nothing had happened and he giggled uncontrollably at me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThat feels like fucking cheating,\u201d I panted, completely out of breath and stamina and bleeding heavily from the stab wound in my shoulder. All this voodoo bullshit was getting on my nerves. I stood up and panted, my legs felt like jelly from the blood I was losing. I was so woozy that at first, I thought I was seeing things as I noticed something standing behind Nightmare Creole. That was until I noticed the familiar bright red uniform and the bright light that he was holding. Jacob waved at me and I noticed he had a hotel ice bucket in his other hand. Nightmare Creole followed my gaze and lay his button eyes on Jacob\u2019s. The bellhop waved to him before tossing the bucket's contents onto Nightmare Creole.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe smell of gasoline hit me and I knew immediately what was going to happen next. I quickly raced toward Jacob as he lit a match and tossed it at Nightmare Creole with a little flick of his finger. The monstrous creature lit up like a candle the moment the match touched him. He let out a horrible screech as the fire spread and completely engulfed him. Jacob quickly picked me up again and ran down the hall, quickly followed by the flaming creature chasing after us.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cW-where are we going?\u201d I winced as I looked down at how heavily my shoulder was bleeding and how lightheaded I was feeling. Jacob said nothing as he ran with me in his arms down towards the pool. Judging by the screams behind us, Nightmare Creole wasn\u2019t far behind when Jacob entered the pool with me. I wondered what he could be looking for in here. He placed me down on the floor and quickly looked around for something. I looked around as well, trying to figure out what it was that Jacob wanted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead! Do you hear me, girl?! Dead!\u201d Nightmare Creole screamed as he entered the pool, his body still flaming like a forest fire. He was so hellbent on killing me and Jacob that he hadn\u2019t noticed that the blue tarp across the pool was hiding a secret underneath him. The moment he stepped on it he went right through it and into the murky gross water underneath him. The loud sizzling and cloud of smoke that followed after clued us into the fact that the fire had been put out.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was ready for him to emerge from the water and ready to attack us when I noticed that he wasn\u2019t moving anymore. He floated to the surface as a sizzled charred corpse. Nightmare Creole was dead. I was confused as to what the hell had just happened. Jacob quickly took off his uniform jacket and ripped the sleeves off of it to make a makeshift bandage for my shoulder. I noticed as he did this that he had a spider tattoo on his right arm. Not exactly something you\u2019d expect from a bellhop but Jacob hadn\u2019t always been a bellhop had he?\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did he just\u2026die?\u201d I asked Jacob as I continued to stare at the crispy corpse just now floating in the murky gross pool water. Jacob finished tying up my bandage before pulling out his notepad and writing a quick explanation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like fire. That weakens them. A sudden change of temperature from the water destroyed organs before they could heal.\u201d And as always he put a smiley face in the corner. I smiled up at him. He\u2019d saved my life. And just as the timer went off announcing that I had survived this game of hide and seek, I watched in horror as Jacob\u2019s head fell off of his shoulder and onto the pool floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take kindly to traitors.\u201d King Creole tsked in disgust as Jacob\u2019s now completely lifeless body fell to the floor. I began to cry uncontrollably as I watched my savior fall to the floor and twitch about in the last stages of life. \u201cYou win, Macedonia. As agreed, you and your family are free.\u201d Creole was just barely containing his anger and it showed. His stupid smile was gone, replaced with a scowl so hateful that I thought he was going back on his deal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026how could you\u2026\u201d I whimpered as I crawled over and picked up Jacob\u2019s severed head and held it close to me. It was a stupid question to ask. Of course, he would do this to me. What had I expected? Me and Jacob walking away into the sunset scott-free? I held Jacob\u2019s head close and gave it a soft squeeze.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cVery easily,\u201d he told me, staring down at me like I was a cockroach. \u201cTell you what, take his head if you\u2019d like. I already have a new employee. And he has a lot of potential.\u201d His smile returned, full of devious and malicious intent. \u201cOn your feet. I\u2019ll escort you back to the shop, but after that, I\u2019d advise you never to cross paths with me again,\u201d he ordered me, snapping his fingers at me so that I could get a move on.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI sniffled and nodded quickly, stuffing Jacob\u2019s head into my backpack and quickly following behind him as he led me back toward the entrance of the hotel. I had one hope to get Jacob back. And that was Mama Dupont. I hoped and prayed that she\u2019d be able to save him in some way.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs me and Creole exited the hotel and reentered the voodoo shop I exited his office and turned the corner to see an unfamiliar person standing at the counter. He had brown hair, a grey hoodie, and a simple name tag on his chest. He looked up from his phone to look at me and was obviously confused as to where the hell I had just come from.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cTravis mah boy! Don\u2019t worry about her, she was just leaving. Right, Mace?\u201d He ordered me, motioning me to shoo. I could take a hint, but I looked over at this dude, Travis, and instantly began to wonder what was going to happen to him. Every part of me wanted to yell and scream at him to just run away. But in the end, I just gave him a simple wave goodbye and exited Ol\u2019 King Creole\u2019s Half Priced Voodoo Store for the last time. Debt-free, but not unscarred.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMama Dupont was more than a little afraid of me when I stumbled back into her shop. Bleeding out of my shoulder and holding a severed head up at her and begging her to save Jacob. I ended up collapsing to the floor and passing out from blood loss. She fixed me up and when I woke up I was surprised to find Jacob standing before me, waving at me happily. He wasn\u2019t exactly the same, his vertical stitches and stables were gone but his button eyes remained and he was about the same as when I first had seen him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to use my last magic mannequin for him. They were a gift from my later mother, but I know that seeing what you have just been through she\u2019d want you to have this as well, my love.\u201d Mama Dupont told me as she walked over and rubbed my head carefully. I could do nothing but start crying uncontrollably and thank her a million times over.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt took a lot of explaining from both myself and my dad to fill my mom in on everything that had happened to us. And also why I had this creepy mute bellhop with me now. But after a lot of arguing crying and a few broken windows, she accepted what had happened and was thankful that we had escaped.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe decided to move as far away as possible from Creole and the voodoo shop. I decided to keep in touch with Mama Dupont as we became penpals and she continued to ensure that nothing bad happened to me or my family. Some of you might say it\u2019s weird for me to keep Jacob around but I don\u2019t care what any of you think. I\u2019m free of that debt and I have something for a consolation prize. A protector and a best friend.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better ending. Well, I obviously could. I could\u2019ve wished for my eye and fingers back. But I\u2019ve learned the lesson of getting involved with wishes. At least this way, I\u2019m not alone in the suffering that happened to me. And having Jacob helps me with all that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s really all I have to say. This was how I was indebted to a voodoo shop. And how I paid it all back. A pound of flesh and much traumatizing later. I\u2019m debt free at last.\u00a0\n\n",

        "content": "\nAs soon as I saw him, I swiped right without hesitation. He was young, and everything about him looked perfect. We were both in our early 30s, and when I discovered that we were a match, I was ecstatic. \n\nMe and Chris started talking over the phone, and he lived in the next state over. We both planned on meeting each other in person.\n\nWhen I saw Chris in person that day, I knew this was the man I was going to love forever. Being with him made me feel like I was apart of something bigger then myself. \n\nI loved everything about him, his smile, his physique, his eyes, and most of all, his personality. \n\nI moved in with him that same exact day, and we made love on our first night together. \n\n1 year later, I noticed changes in my health. I took a pregnancy test and I tested positive. I didn\u2019t know how Chris would react, but he seemed really excited about having a child. \n\nMy parents scolded me for getting pregnant before me and Chris\u2019s marriage , but we ended up having a gender reveal party, and found out we were having a baby boy. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 and a half years since we met on tinder, and our son, Tyler, is now a year and a half old. \n\nChris proposed to me 6 months ago, and our wedding day is in 2 weeks. I just wish I never found out about his secret hobby. \n\nFor the last 2 years, people in our town have been mysteriously disappearing, with the majority being women. \n\nHe left almost zero trace of what he was doing. He was so good at hiding it. \n\nThe one thing I found suspicious, was every night, after we\u2019d put our son to bed, he would always give me a glass of water before bed. \n\nMy entire life I\u2019ve had sleeping issues, some nights I wouldn\u2019t even sleep at all, but ever since I moved in with Chris, I\u2019ve been sleeping perfectly, sometimes even 13 to 14 hours of sleep a night. \n\nIt was when I became suspicious when I walked in on Chris sharpening that giant axe.\n\nI never really bothered Chris while he was working in the basement on his tools. I went down stairs and saw the axe. The handle had to be atleast 5 feet long, and he was sharpening the shit out of that blade. \n\nHe works as an electrician, and as far as I know they don\u2019t carry an axe that huge with them. He didn\u2019t hear or see me, so I rushed back upstairs. \n\nAfter we put our son to bed that night, when he offered me the water, I held it in my mouth, then ran to the sink to spit it out. I noticed that I wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep whatsoever. I laid there pretending to sleep, and after about 2 hours, my husband got out of bed. I saw the hall light turn on, and the basement door creaked open. \n\nIt was extremely hard to see what was happening, but I did see that axe blade. \n\nI then heard the back door open. I rushed to look out the bathroom window, and I could see him going down to that old storm cellar in the corner of the yard. \n\nI never asked about the storm cellar, he said it\u2019s been there since he bought the house. \n\nHe then unlocked the door, and walked down its stairs. He slammed the door behind him. \n\nI then ran out the back door, and put my ear up to the storm cellar. I could hear a voice, a women\u2019s voice. The voice was weeping, and begging. \n\n\u201cI sharpened my axe for you\u201d I heard Chris yell in a sinister voice. The women then screamed, at the top of her lungs, and Chris started laughing. \n\nI unlatched the door and sprinted down those stairs. In front of me was a room which had walls stained red. Chris had his back toward me and had that axe in his hands, dripping with blood. The women in-front of him had a river of blood pouring out of what was left of her mangled arm. \n\n\u201cChris\u201d I said in a horrified voice.\n\nChris then turned to me, with blood in his smile.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about time you found out\u201d he said. \n\nI started vomiting, I couldn\u2019t even see straight. How could someone be so evil, I thought. I started screaming curse words in his direction. He then grabbed me by my shoulders.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that\u201d he said while trying to calm me down. He then handed me the axe.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me finish her off\u201d he said, gesturing toward the dying woman. She looked to be about my age. She looked at me with desperation in her eyes. \n\n\u201cFinish her, aim for the head\u201d Chris told me.  \n\nShe started sobbing, to the point where I could barely hear Chris. \n\n\u201cFINISH HER\u201d Chris screamed.\n\nThat night was the worst night of my life, but I believe that I did the right thing. I did what I did for Chris, and I love him. Now I\u2019ve got a wedding to prepare for.",
