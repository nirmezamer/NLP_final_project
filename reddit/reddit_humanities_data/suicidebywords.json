            "she will run out of kidneys very soon",
            "Well here's the idea. Sometimes teachers don't know every student from class just by their looks so they ask the name and the student should respond to show the teacher he is there. And through my experience. More than 90% of the time the student forgets to respond and he gets an absence because he is not paying attention. And instead of asking nicely if they can remove the absence because they were in class they decide to rant about it and call the teacher an idiot, the r word etc. I've seen this happen way too many times in my 12 years of learning in school and I was always sad when someone gets angry about it when I know they weren't paying attention, especially when they did it to actually really cool teachers.",
