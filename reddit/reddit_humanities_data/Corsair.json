Since I don't have three PCIe slots on the PSU available (2 already in use for the CPU so only 2 left) ordering an extra PCIe won't do. \n\nAfter browsing reddit for a while I found that some people advice to buy the 600w 4 12VHPWR cable from Corsair to plug in the GPU directly, connecting it to two PCIe slots in the PSU.\nI've ordered this cable but wanted to quadruple check before I destroy my GPU;\n\nIs this solution recommend, or should I buy another PSU?
