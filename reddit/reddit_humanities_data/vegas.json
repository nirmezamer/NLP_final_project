My flights are non refundable and it\u2019s too soon to get a refund for the room. \n\nI\u2019m pretty familiar with Vegas but I\u2019m not sure about going alone. This would be my first solo trip and I\u2019m kinda paranoid. I wanna just take my loss with everything but I\u2019ve spent too much money. \n\nCan any solo female travelers give me advice please :)",

That don't mean shit to your life and you'll never see them again. Someone bothering you just be like, \"sorry I'm waiting for my husband to come out the sports book, no thanks\". You walking on the strip and someone tries to talk to you, just fucking ignore them! That's what I do! And if they get in ky way I just say \"no thank you\" even if they're asking for change or something. You want to gamble, look at any machine or table, it's a solo sport! You see people alone and have no idea if they're with someone.",
            "I\u2019ve traveled to Vegas many times solo and I haven\u2019t had any problems. I also don\u2019t drink. so if you are a solo female traveler who drinks alcohol just try and keep it a minimum keep your wits about you",

            "I\u2019m not female but my advice is that it will be safe as long as you use some street smarts and stay on the strip. If you are staying at the strat be careful because the area behind the strat can be rough. Also the north end of the strip can be dark and desolate at night so just stay aware.  If you want to go to the palms or somewhere off strip take an Uber .",
            "Drink more water than you think you'll need, wear some actual walking shoes, don't accept open drinks unless you see the bartender give them to you directly, don't talk to anybody on a sidewalk trying to get your attention, and don't venture too far east or west from the Strip. You'll be fine, have a good time.",

No matter how drunk you get, no matter how much money you\u2019re playing with, man or woman, you\u2019re always being watched. I met a dude who was literally robbed by escorts and he told me security knocked on his door with all of his stuff before they were able to leave the property.",

In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checking into an airport, and if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids? Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.\""
