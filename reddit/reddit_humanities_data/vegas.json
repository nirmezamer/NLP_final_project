My flights are non refundable and it\u2019s too soon to get a refund for the room. \n\nI\u2019m pretty familiar with Vegas but I\u2019m not sure about going alone. This would be my first solo trip and I\u2019m kinda paranoid. I wanna just take my loss with everything but I\u2019ve spent too much money. \n\nCan any solo female travelers give me advice please :)",

            "Plenty of solo female travelers. I get them as guests every week. I use to be really involved with the \"Couchsurfing\" community when I was in my 20's (alot of younger people used that app) and that app/ community has alot of solo travelers in general (female included) so you could probably meetup with some while you're in Vegas. \n\nAlso, when dining out, sit at the bar, usually you can find other solo travelers there. You can at least chat with the bartender and have someone to talk to as oppose to dining at a table alone. Sit in the middle - let's people know you're approachable. Sit at the ends if you don't want to be bothered.\n\nTours of course are another great way of meeting solo travelers. There are walking tours, pool party hopping, night club hopping, bar crawls, food tours. Create an itinerary so you're not alone walking around aimlessly. Amuse yourself and give yourself plenty to do.\n\nTraveling alone is fun and I've done plenty of it. Especially the older you get and your friends go different ways. I got to a point where I was always waiting on others and just like you, plans fall through. Eventually, you gotta say \"f*ck it\" and take the leap or you'll never do anything. A great way to learn about yourself and experience the world on your own terms. Be open to meeting people but of course be aware.",
            "Believe it or not, most people aren't going to know you're a solo traveler unless you tell them. Go out and do what you want to do, if anyone bothers you just fucking lie to them! That don't mean shit to your life and you'll never see them again. Someone bothering you just be like, \"sorry I'm waiting for my husband to come out the sports book, no thanks\". You walking on the strip and someone tries to talk to you, just fucking ignore them! That's what I do! And if they get in ky way I just say \"no thank you\" even if they're asking for change or something. You want to gamble, look at any machine or table, it's a solo sport! You see people alone and have no idea if they're with someone.",

            "I\u2019ve traveled to Vegas many times solo and I haven\u2019t had any problems. I also don\u2019t drink. so if you are a solo female traveler who drinks alcohol just try and keep it a minimum keep your wits about you",

No matter how drunk you get, no matter how much money you\u2019re playing with, man or woman, you\u2019re always being watched. I met a dude who was literally robbed by escorts and he told me security knocked on his door with all of his stuff before they were able to leave the property.",
            "I\u2019m not female but my advice is that it will be safe as long as you use some street smarts and stay on the strip. If you are staying at the strat be careful because the area behind the strat can be rough. Also the north end of the strip can be dark and desolate at night so just stay aware.  If you want to go to the palms or somewhere off strip take an Uber .",
            "It\u2019s fairly safe, just when you go out don\u2019t accept drinks from strangers but that\u2019s a common knowledge these days"
