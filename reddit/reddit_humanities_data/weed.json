I would think I was doing awesome and then when I was sober again I'd watch saved replays and realize how terrible I was.  Sometimes my mind would drift and I'd just sit in the spawn room until the game threatened to kick me for inactivity.  I feel a little bad for costing all those random teams all those matches.  I miss OG Overwatch.",
