            "Thanks for the post, always love to see it. My question is about selecting large groups of units. I believe max group size (on a key bind) is 60. Are there ways to select more than 60 units? I think drag and double clicking both also cap at 60. I thought I saw someone say select all allows grabbing more, but don't think I've had any success.",
            "I think the idea behind the Gurjara camel scout is the way to balance Cumans. That is, instead of the 2nd TC in Feudal Age, say they got a building called Town Hall that had 1800 HP, 4 attack, couldn't research techs, and created villagers in 35 seconds instead of 25 seconds? It would automatically upgrade to a Town Center in Castle Age, and you could still do the '2TC' thing, it just wouldn't be as good.",
            "How valuable is preserving your 3-5 scouts in a scout rush vs losing them in exchange for killing a couple vils? I know the high level players always micro around for ages with scouts, but for a 30 apm, 1100 elo player like me is it better to just get a couple kills to get ahead and not worry about keeping them alive?",
            "What are considerations to add thrash to your main gold unit? In general I struggle on my decision making when to do it.   \nFor example when I go knights I love having skirms when they go pike. But that only seems to work well when there was a feudal war where I needed Skirms ... If i'm already in castle going skirm seems so slow. And I feel skorps are the way to go. But I see that many posts about Knights + skirms are a great combo, and I agree just not sure how/when to get there.",
            "how to defeat cuman on arabia?",
            "How the fuck do you even beat Joan Campaign mission 6 on Standard?\n\nThe 3 AIs are like 2.5k ELO and they already start with large, established Imperial Age bases; the moment you take down Purple's north TC all 3 AIs start spamming waves after waves of Halberds/Paladins/Galleons as if those cost nothing to them. I barely got anything built before getting overrun myself",
            "As Teutons, it has to be worth it to delay the farm upgrades, right? But for how long?",
            "is there a civ that gets passive regen on cavalry?\n\nlike i know there are civs for elephant regen and villager regen but is there something like that for other units?",
            "When building the barracks and stable for scout rush, which 2 vills do you use? Wood vills or food vills from sheep?",

            "Personally I do want \"more\" of everything: more unique units and techs for each Civ (even if it's just light re-flavoring), more Civs, more skins and stuff...",
            "The reason this hasnt been done yet is for clarity: a new player can get overwhelmed by the amount of regional/different units and already with Monks there is also the tech tree to learn at higher elos (have or not have Redemption etc.), this would add confusion.\n\nSimilar considerations for Knights etc.",
            "Awesome stuff and fun video.\n\nThe Ninja Shurikens are esp nice, that alone could be a charged attack like multiple shurikens thrown at once then sword for regular attacks.",
            "It would just make it a different game",
            "And also if you want really unique civs then you can play aoe4",
            "There's no reason you couldn't turn it on though just for yourself. Much like other mods which add skins and change units.",
            "this was already in the game 5 years ago. nobody was confused by that",
            "Anything on a white horse is the knight line. Now apply regional skins already!\n\nAoE2 has a way of making units AND buildings that are different and yet recognisable at a quick glance. Really won't be that hard.",
            "Why not with a toggleable option ? You can choose small trees so why not disable regional skins as a checkmark option?",
            "Trade carts are different and nobody complains.\n\nMonks make a (deafening) noise and all these models are old men with sticks, they would be fine."
