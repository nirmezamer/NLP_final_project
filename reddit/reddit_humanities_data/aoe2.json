            "If I find myself stuck hovering at around 900 ELO, should I focus on practicing against the AI at all? Or should I keep playing against players?\n\nMy thinking was playing against players is good from the perspective of adapting to randomness, etc., but would I be just as well suited practicing against AI? \n\nIf AI, which difficultly level to get myself hovering around 1000-1100, say?\n\nWololo, and cheers.",
            "I had to retake the ranked benchmark test this week, and for the first time, my performance was lower than 1k (971-986), which got me the message that I cannot play team games anymore. \n\nI still can if I lower my resolution, but it confronted me to the fact that I've been spoiled with somewhat decent graphics.\n\nI'm puzzled though what could have caused a drop in performance. Nothing about my laptop has changed.\n\nI need a mild boost in performance to get there: any recommendations? I'm a total luddite so idk if I have to delete files/game recs or something?\n\nAny help is appreciated, but explain like you would to your grandpa",
            "Thanks for the post, always love to see it. My question is about selecting large groups of units. I believe max group size (on a key bind) is 60. Are there ways to select more than 60 units? I think drag and double clicking both also cap at 60. I thought I saw someone say select all allows grabbing more, but don't think I've had any success.",
            "Britons vs Hindustani ghulams -- most unwinnable matchup?\n\nxbows: suicide  \nknights: without bloodlines they don't trade well, plus hindu player responds camels  \nlongsword/champs: O.K but clunky, then dies hard in imp with hindu handcannons\n\nIs this just gg if you can't stop hindu player from getting stone?  \nHas this been seen in any pro games?",
            "I think the idea behind the Gurjara camel scout is the way to balance Cumans. That is, instead of the 2nd TC in Feudal Age, say they got a building called Town Hall that had 1800 HP, 4 attack, couldn't research techs, and created villagers in 35 seconds instead of 25 seconds? It would automatically upgrade to a Town Center in Castle Age, and you could still do the '2TC' thing, it just wouldn't be as good.",
            "How valuable is preserving your 3-5 scouts in a scout rush vs losing them in exchange for killing a couple vils? I know the high level players always micro around for ages with scouts, but for a 30 apm, 1100 elo player like me is it better to just get a couple kills to get ahead and not worry about keeping them alive?",
            "What are considerations to add thrash to your main gold unit? In general I struggle on my decision making when to do it.   \nFor example when I go knights I love having skirms when they go pike. But that only seems to work well when there was a feudal war where I needed Skirms ... If i'm already in castle going skirm seems so slow. And I feel skorps are the way to go. But I see that many posts about Knights + skirms are a great combo, and I agree just not sure how/when to get there.",
            "how to defeat cuman on arabia?",
            "How the fuck do you even beat Joan Campaign mission 6 on Standard?\n\nThe 3 AIs are like 2.5k ELO and they already start with large, established Imperial Age bases; the moment you take down Purple's north TC all 3 AIs start spamming waves after waves of Halberds/Paladins/Galleons as if those cost nothing to them. I barely got anything built before getting overrun myself",

            "For me it\u2019s the refusal to learn / adopt build orders",
            "I mean to an extent. I use my hotkeys, can castle in 14-15mins, can quick wall effectively, lure multiple boar, lure hunt, rarely have idles, and generally don't stop producing vills.\n\nHowever, is also:\n\ncan't micro to save my life, take long breaks from the game so my play is inconsistent, and get bored of the same strats and vills so I wing it and do fun silly things like laming, douching, all kinds of rushes with extreme eco imbalance, spamming fun units vs logical ones, chatting more than playing, etc.\n\nMany of those reasons can also keep a person's ego down. It's still frustrating sometimes. I wish I could toggle the Elon off because I'm going to play how I'm going to play and I like the ranked latter I just only care about elo about 2% of the time.\n\nEdit: also 11 - 800 Elo. I bounce from 1000 to 700 depending on how dumb the strats get (used to dip into the 600s).",

            "Doesn't matter as long as you enjoy the game.\n\nBuuut in case one wants to improve I'd say you don't have to start with all hotkeys at once.\n\nJust using the \"shift key\" alone makes your life a whole lot easier.\n \n1. You can queue up 5 units at once\n2. Sell/buy 500 resources in market at once (also works when you send resources to ally)\n3. Place multiple buildings in one go without going back into the building menu every time (Just think of all the farms and houses)\n4. Effectively take one sheep at a time\n5. Plan the route of your scout ahead of time\n6. Send a villager to another task after one is done e.g. build barracks -> go to wood\n\nAfter that I'd look into control groups, specifically to use it for singular buildings or multiple buildings of the same type. This allows you to\n\n1. Queue up units without actually going back to the building allowing you to keep microing your army without looking away.\n2. Queue up the same amount of units in all buildings at once\n3. Set the same gathering point of all at once\n\nAfter that wanting to set up more hotkeys is simply a question of what hotkey would save you more time/actions and then thinking about how you can comfortably implement it. \nIf you ever played a game with WASD it is helpful to set up your hotkeys around that since you are already used to it.",
