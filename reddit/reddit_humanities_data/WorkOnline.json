            "I get what you\u2019re saying, but as someone pointed out already in the comments, sometimes you spend hours (or in my case, years) researching online jobs through Google, Indeed, Monster, YouTube or whatever but you come across the same types of jobs all the time that may require skills that you don\u2019t have or equipment you can\u2019t afford.I\u2019ve started coming to this thread because I was tired of coming across jobs like \u201cVirtual assistance\u201d or \u201cCustomer Service\u201d etc. all the time. All of which I have applied to, but never got anywhere with. This thread has exposed me to jobs that I never would have been introduced to otherwise despite the many years of trying to find online work. I\u2019ve also found new places to find online work through this thread, from people who have asked those types of questions, which has helped a lot.",
            "\n\nHonestly this is such a privileged take from someone who had probably, already, successfully gotten an online job when this was posted. I fully understand that on subs like this, hundreds of people will post the same obvious question, even with a mega-thread pinned to the top of the sub. But I and many others have done all the things that \u201cain\u2019t exactly rocket science\u201d like \u201cgoing to a job engine site\u201d, having certifications and or taking courses, having experience in the field or even a degree, applying, doing hours long qualification tests, and interviewing, just to not even get a reply back saying we didn\u2019t get the position. Many of which applied to a similar position in person and they got the job. \n\nYes I\u2019m sure many people come on here just asking what can I do, just expecting a simple answer without doing even a Google search by themselves. But many people, myself included, want to know what companies have actually hired you, what sites we should avoid, lesser known tips, ways they filter out candidates, or even specific jobs that aren\u2019t very common, that may fit us very well. Not to mention those who may be older or less inclined to the internet, especially with such a new thing as working online, and simply don\u2019t know where to begin. And telling them do the obvious thing like go on job sites or take courses, just to be sarcastic and ironic towards the few people that come on here without putting in any thought, isn\u2019t helping anyone. Especially when you posted it in a format that seemed like it could actually be helpful for the people who really need it. \n\nIt honestly comes off as extremely privileged, and unaware of how things actually are for most people. Like can we address how ridiculous it is that we\u2019re supposed to spend hundreds out of our own pocket (or at the very least our time) on courses, on very specific skills, for the OPPORTUNITY to get a job. For the certificate to prove we\u2019re certified or have experience, on something that can easily be trained or that most people can pick up  on their own. Where they still may not even respond to you, let alone hire you. And the people that come here wondering why this may be happening, (even though they aren\u2019t being \u201clazy\u201d ) and want to know ways to combat this, from people that may have succeed in the past. Get treated with a post like this pinned to the top of the sub? No wonder trying to find a job online is so bad, people with zero human empathy, and common sense, like you, are the ones behind the desk, already secured in their future, making these comments about \u201clazy\u201d people, and deciding wether they\u2019re worthy for a barely livable wage position, that still could be the difference between being homeless and having food on the table.",

            "I agree \n\nI just think ppl don't have the knowledge of how to properly Google. How to use keywords properly to get the search results they want.  Also it might just be a gwnerational gap of older workers looking to transition from traditional work. They just don't have the tech knowledge to figure out where to start.  \n\nI'm sure some ppl are lazy and don't put in the work and just making a post expecting resources.",
            "The problem with this is that some of us ARE Googling it. I'm the queen of using my resources, and I still keep getting stuck with scams and work from home jobs that aren't in California. \n\nI tried Upwork, but literally every single job posting I apply to does that scammy \"here's the link to your Telegram interview\" bullshit. I finally closed my account yesterday.  I've done Fiverr, but no buyers. Freelancer seems to be the same scammer posts as Upwork, but WORSE.\n\nI get what the general sentiment is in this post,but holy shit I don't know how the hell people are getting these legit WFH jobs unless their office jobs went remote during covid.\n\nEven if you type \"work from home\" or \"remote\" into Google or Indeed, a shitload of results come back with jobs that are in person,but were marked \"remote\" or \"telecommute\". ( just saw a post on Indeed yesterday for a restaurant server position that said \" remote\". Wtf)\n\nThen there's positions that are legit, but pay $7 an hour. \n\n\nSo yes, excuse us for seeing WFH jobs as a big mystery or lottery.",

            "After a year or two of looking for the answer to this same question it seems to me that there are two answers.\n\n**For the unskilled:**\n\n- Surveys that pay next to nothing and disqualify you 9 times out of 10 after asking your gender / marital status / annual income for the thousandth time even though that information is all part of your profile and is supposed to be taken into consideration automatically.\n\n- Offer walls that only seem to actually pay you 50% of the time and where the highest paying jobs usually require you spending more money than you earn.\n\n- Cryptocurrency faucets that give you a 1/10,000 chance of getting anything worthwhile once an hour or once a day.\n\n- Transcription jobs that can be worthwhile if you live in a country with a shitty currency and you treat it like a 9 to 5 full time job.\n\n**For the skilled:**\n\n- Programming.\n\n- Blogs.",
            "Yes. Ok. I have browsed the sub. I have googled. However, there\u2019s a catch: I\u2019m profoundly deaf and many or most of these jobs require the ability to speak on the phone, communicate via zoom, etc. so what should I do? I could really use some guidance here.\n\nThis post is 3 days old so if I don\u2019t get much traction here I\u2019ll repost this as a separate post and add more detail. But right now I\u2019m just looking for general ideas, thanks!",
