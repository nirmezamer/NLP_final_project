        "content": "Hi and welcome to [r/dragonquest](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/) !\n\nDragon Quest is a series of traditional turn-based Japanese Role-playing games (JRPGS) that feature colorful enemies, heartwarming music, a strong sense of character, intriguing stories, and solid gameplay. While traditional, Dragon Quest games have been quite influential, being among the first JRPGs for consoles and consistently featuring innovations (such as monster taming in Dragon Quest 5 years before Pokemon popularized it). There are also a large number of spinoffs in different categories -- Action RPG, Voxel Builder, monster raising, and more!\n\nWe've created a wiki page describing the games and some opinions of them:[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/wiki/index)\n\nAlthough the wiki is intended as an introduction to the series, **you are still welcome to post your own** \"which Dragon Quest should I play\" posts. Why? Because, just like every player is unique, so is every Dragon Quest. It's less about \"Which Dragon Quest is Best\" and more about \"Which Dragon Quest might I enjoy the most?\"\n\nSo, while this post is hopefully a fun starting point for new members, please do feel free to ask questions and read through some recommendations from others in the comments below or in archived threads. (I'm relying on experts from this subreddit to help me out -- Please give feedback below! The task is too big for one person.)\n\nThis subreddit is designed to be a welcoming place to discuss and share our love for the series. Of course, not everyone will love every game, but as fans we can critique the series without making it a personal attack on other fans.\n\nThank you and have fun questing!\n\n(Previous, archived threads: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/japbme/welcome\\_to\\_rdragonquest\\_series\\_overview\\_and/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/japbme/welcome_to_rdragonquest_series_overview_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/buo2cs/what\\_is\\_dragon\\_quest\\_which\\_game\\_should\\_i\\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/buo2cs/what_is_dragon_quest_which_game_should_i_play/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/g0xi10/welcome\\_to\\_rdragonquest\\_intro\\_and\\_advice\\_on\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/g0xi10/welcome_to_rdragonquest_intro_and_advice_on_the/))",

            "I finished DQ XI the other day and it was a fun time, but the soundtrack honestly is just not good at all for a 100+ hour game. There are good songs, but they get old FAST. Especially when it feels like there are only 10 tracks in total.\n\nAre the other dragon quest games like this? Cause I'd love to try some of the other games, but not ones where it feels like they're playing the same theme for 10 hours straight :/",
            "I\u2019m loving DQ XI. I\u2019ve heard it and VIII are the pinnacles of the series. Is it still worth going back to play VIII, though, if I would need to buy a PS2 to play? I have a Switch, PS3, and Xbox One S.",
            "Looks like the wiki page recommends the iOS/Android versions for the first six games. I'd love to hear what series fans think of those ports, particularly as a first-time player.",
            "I recently played through all four versions of Dragon Quest 1 (NES, SFC, GBC, NS) and I really enjoyed the SFC version with fan translation patch. The translation is not perfect but I really loved the coherent 16-bit graphics and melodious soundtrack. If anyone is considering to play DQ1 and wondering which version is suitable for you, feel free to check out a video I created discussing the differences. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/adypLilRHq8",
            "Hello y\u2019all! I\u2019ve finished DQ9 and 11 and was wondering what should my next DQ game be and what\u2019s the best version to play on.",
            "I am over 40 years old and played Dragon Warrior on NES...\n\nI just picked up the trilogy on Switch and going through Dragon Quest 1 now.  Brings back memories...  :)",
            "Just finished 11S which is my first DQ game and I NEED MORE.\n\nWhat's the best way to play previous games? As in which platforms for every game?",
            "Here you go u/RNGreed.",
            "I just started playing the series. I'm currently grinding in Dragon Warrior on NES!",
            "I'm playing my first DQ game on the Switch: DQ XI S. I'm in the post game, or act 3 as some refer to it, and I have been enjoying every minute of it. I haven't been completely enchanted with a game like this in a long time. The few games that have enchanted me in a similar way were Pokemon Red, Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy 9, and Kingdom Hearts. So I'm taking my sweet time in the post game not wanting it to end.\n\nWhat Dragon Quest game should I play after this one? I'll probably take a break after I finish this to let my mind settle for a bit. I dont want to immediately jump into another DQ game right away for fear of burning out. But when I do choose to start a new one, I'm currently checking out DQ 7 and DQ 8 on the 3DS, but not sure if those are good ones to start next, or if I should try another one. And what about spin offs? Are they any good?"

            "To me a localization of DQ X is a bigger need. Every mainline game is readily available in some official form in the west, except DQ X. Like DQ IX is great don\u2019t get me wrong, but at least it\u2019s been officially localized. DQ X doesn\u2019t even have that.",
            "I say we need a complete DQ8 on modern consoles first.  It's a shame they didn't capitalize on the success of 11 with new fans by making the similar 8 more available (apart from the rather irritating iOS version, which has poor controls, no voices, and no 3DS content).",
            "I\u2019m sure they will remake Dragon Quest IX eventually.",

The orchestrated OST is phenomenal, the characters make me smile, the game could be challenging at some points- but never enough to make me ragequit (it was a nice balance!), there's just SO MUCH to do!  That combined with the additional challenge of playing with Draconian quests gives it a lot of replayability!  (I'm currently playing with just regular Shypox, but I'm definitely gonna play again with more of a challenge).  I think I could go on for a while about this, heheh.  I finished the main story and I'm currently doing post-game stuff (act 3), and I kept finding myself getting distracted by all the stuff they added in that portion of the game.\n\n  \nDQ11 is also really the only one I've played, so I would like to ask the people of this subreddit...\n\n1. What did you guys think of the game?\n\n2. What DQ game(s) should I play next?\n\n  \n11 has gotten me really hooked and interested in playing more of the games from the series, so I'd love to hear what you guys have to say!  Please don't mention any major spoilers for anything :) <3",

DQ8 is very similar in DQ11 in terms of gameplay, then DQ7 \u2192 DQ4-5-6 \u2192 DQ3-1-2.\n\nor you can check spin-off games, although they have hits and misses. The favourites one for me are Builders, Monsters and Heroes.",

            "I've only played 9 and 11 but had a blast playing then. \n\n\nI know its not the same but dam if the story towards the end of dragon quest builders really get me. Like actual jaw dropping action.",
            "Incredible this is almost the perfect dq game ever \n\nDefinitely play 8 next",
            "Play 8 next",
            "I really like it. It was my first DQ game I beat since I beat the first 3 years ago. After Toriyama passed, I made a vow to play through all of them since I never played 4-9 or 11. Just beat DQ5 the other day, and it instantly became my new favorite game of all time. DQ is really in a class of its own for the experience and journey."
