        "content": "Hi and welcome to [r/dragonquest](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/) !\n\nDragon Quest is a series of traditional turn-based Japanese Role-playing games (JRPGS) that feature colorful enemies, heartwarming music, a strong sense of character, intriguing stories, and solid gameplay. While traditional, Dragon Quest games have been quite influential, being among the first JRPGs for consoles and consistently featuring innovations (such as monster taming in Dragon Quest 5 years before Pokemon popularized it). There are also a large number of spinoffs in different categories -- Action RPG, Voxel Builder, monster raising, and more!\n\nWe've created a wiki page describing the games and some opinions of them:[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/wiki/index)\n\nAlthough the wiki is intended as an introduction to the series, **you are still welcome to post your own** \"which Dragon Quest should I play\" posts. Why? Because, just like every player is unique, so is every Dragon Quest. It's less about \"Which Dragon Quest is Best\" and more about \"Which Dragon Quest might I enjoy the most?\"\n\nSo, while this post is hopefully a fun starting point for new members, please do feel free to ask questions and read through some recommendations from others in the comments below or in archived threads. (I'm relying on experts from this subreddit to help me out -- Please give feedback below! The task is too big for one person.)\n\nThis subreddit is designed to be a welcoming place to discuss and share our love for the series. Of course, not everyone will love every game, but as fans we can critique the series without making it a personal attack on other fans.\n\nThank you and have fun questing!\n\n(Previous, archived threads: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/japbme/welcome\\_to\\_rdragonquest\\_series\\_overview\\_and/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/japbme/welcome_to_rdragonquest_series_overview_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/buo2cs/what\\_is\\_dragon\\_quest\\_which\\_game\\_should\\_i\\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/buo2cs/what_is_dragon_quest_which_game_should_i_play/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/g0xi10/welcome\\_to\\_rdragonquest\\_intro\\_and\\_advice\\_on\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/g0xi10/welcome_to_rdragonquest_intro_and_advice_on_the/))",

            "I finished DQ XI the other day and it was a fun time, but the soundtrack honestly is just not good at all for a 100+ hour game. There are good songs, but they get old FAST. Especially when it feels like there are only 10 tracks in total.\n\nAre the other dragon quest games like this? Cause I'd love to try some of the other games, but not ones where it feels like they're playing the same theme for 10 hours straight :/",
            "Im loving DQ XI. Ive heard it and VIII are the pinnacles of the series. Is it still worth going back to play VIII, though, if I would need to buy a PS2 to play? I have a Switch, PS3, and Xbox One S.",
            "Looks like the wiki page recommends the iOS/Android versions for the first six games. I'd love to hear what series fans think of those ports, particularly as a first-time player.",
            "Hello yall! Ive finished DQ9 and 11 and was wondering what should my next DQ game be and whats the best version to play on.",
            "I am over 40 years old and played Dragon Warrior on NES...\n\nI just picked up the trilogy on Switch and going through Dragon Quest 1 now.  Brings back memories...  :)",
            "Just finished 11S which is my first DQ game and I NEED MORE.\n\nWhat's the best way to play previous games? As in which platforms for every game?",
            "I just started playing the series. I'm currently grinding in Dragon Warrior on NES!",
            "I'm currently in post-game of Dragon Quest XI S. >!When I got back in time, some of my party member's equipment items were duplicated, is that on purpose?!<",
            "Heyy!! I really like the look of DQ XI but i never played any turn based rpg (other than Pokmon but idk if it counts), i was wondering if itll be hard for me to play it since i always lean on the more action rpgs, which arent turn based. What would you guys say? And also i never played any DQ in the series so, will it be hard to understand and follow the story?",
            "I just beat DQ XI and want to play DQ V which i heard is best to play the DS version of the game. Is there anyway to get it for the DS without spending 100+ dollars or should i bite the bullet and get it on mobile?"

            "Im sure they will remake Dragon Quest IX eventually.",
            "To me a localization of DQ X is a bigger need. Every mainline game is readily available in some official form in the west, except DQ X. Like DQ IX is great dont get me wrong, but at least its been officially localized. DQ X doesnt even have that.",
            "I remember that the closest mention of something like that happening was before the 20th anniversary of DQ the main dude was hinted towards it possibly happening and nothing since that",
            "I say we need a complete DQ8 on modern consoles first.  It's a shame they didn't capitalize on the success of 11 with new fans by making the similar 8 more available (apart from the rather irritating iOS version, which has poor controls, no voices, and no 3DS content).",
            "They need to get all the dragon quests out of mobile hell so bad.",
            "I feel your pain, dq ix was my first game ",
            "No. instead what we need is final fantasy XXXIX cause obviously that's what we need",
            "Yeah, I think that's the shooting star I was making a few wishes on as well.  I think we just overloaded its capabilities.",
            "I'm replaying it these days after years and it still rocks hard. The story is cool and the dialogues are honestly hilarious especially in my language (Italian) where they made it so people speak different dialects, I'm finding the combat system a bit lame because all I do is attack and use healing spells when I'm in danger but maybe it's my party formation that is boring.",
            "Pretty nice game. You could spend so much hours in this game and had probably most quests available."

        "content": "I won't mention anything spoiler-y, but I just wanted to say that DQ 11 has legitimately become one of my most favorite games of all time.  The orchestrated OST is phenomenal, the characters make me smile, the game could be challenging at some points- but never enough to make me ragequit (it was a nice balance!), there's just SO MUCH to do!  That combined with the additional challenge of playing with Draconian quests gives it a lot of replayability!  (I'm currently playing with just regular Shypox, but I'm definitely gonna play again with more of a challenge).  I think I could go on for a while about this, heheh.  I finished the main story and I'm currently doing post-game stuff (act 3), and I kept finding myself getting distracted by all the stuff they added in that portion of the game.\n\nDQ11 is also really the only one I've played, so I would like to ask the people of this subreddit...\n\n1. What did you guys think of the game?\n2. What DQ game(s) should I play next?\n\n11 has gotten me really hooked and interested in playing more of the games from the series, so I'd love to hear what you guys have to say!  Please don't mention any major spoilers for anything :) <3\n\nEdit:  Thank you to everyone who replied!!  Your responses have been really helpful!  I see a good handful of people mentioning 8, so I'll definitely go and check it out!  Thank you again!",

            "First one I played, still my favorite.\n\nHave played 1,5,7,8,9. You should try 8 or 5",
            "The OST needed a lot more tracks. This is my first Dragon Quest game and I'm in love but holy crap one overworld song ain't it.",
            "Incredible this is almost the perfect dq game ever \n\nDefinitely play 8 next",
            "The very reason why I sank 280 hours into this game and it helped me through the Covid days. It was my first proper entry to the DQ series too. I love the art style, the characters and the world building. Another one I'd recommend you to play would be DQ8 ",
            "I really like it. It was my first DQ game I beat since I beat the first 3 years ago. After Toriyama passed, I made a vow to play through all of them since I never played 4-9 or 11. Just beat DQ5 the other day, and it instantly became my new favorite game of all time. DQ is really in a class of its own for the experience and journey.",
            "DQ11 was my first DQ game. I loved it because it was the game that, to me, felt closest to golden era Final Fantasy since that era. I havent been much of a fan of FF since I gave up on 13 and DQ11 showed me that great turn-based RPGs are still out there.",
            "This saga brings so much joy into my heart, whenever i hear the theme song, its the start of an adventure !!!!",
            "It's far from my favorite title in the series. An amazing game nonetheless.",
            "Having come from DQ9 it was a tad jarring with the lack of character and companion customisations, I'm not too far into the game just yet",
            "I wouldn't say it's my favorite game of all time or anything, but it's very high on my list of favorite JRPGs.\n\nIf you decide to play the original 3, I recommend playing them in release order. The GBC remakes are great, but I haven't really played the remakes on more recent platforms, so I can't comment on those. The reason I say play them in release order is partially for some spoilery reasons, and also because the games got SO much more sophisticated that going backwards can be a real shock."
