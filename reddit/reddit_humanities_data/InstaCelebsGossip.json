            "This is really tough even influencers also make mistakes . \n1. findation.com is a good site to start if you know any shade from any brand.\n2. Go to a mall & test there & buy from their first time . (This is for beginners)\n3. Find someone (content creator ) same as your skintone and use them as reference. I got mine from @spellsparkles . I asked her in DM and she helped me to find my shade as I was noob in makeup\n4. Watch YouTube swatches of particular brand which you are interested in and then click your picture in nature lighting - go to insta story - use that pic- use text tool - use color tool to select a area around your cheeks - screenshot that shade/color - go online and match that screenshot with the shade picture on nykaa \n.\nI hope it make sense . If you have any further questions do let me know",
