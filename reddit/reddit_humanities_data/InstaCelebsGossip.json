            "This is really tough even influencers also make mistakes . \n1. findation.com is a good site to start if you know any shade from any brand.\n2. Go to a mall & test there & buy from their first time . (This is for beginners)\n3. Find someone (content creator ) same as your skintone and use them as reference. I got mine from @spellsparkles . I asked her in DM and she helped me to find my shade as I was noob in makeup\n4. Watch YouTube swatches of particular brand which you are interested in and then click your picture in nature lighting - go to insta story - use that pic- use text tool - use color tool to select a area around your cheeks - screenshot that shade/color - go online and match that screenshot with the shade picture on nykaa \n.\nI hope it make sense . If you have any further questions do let me know",

While Aditi\u2019s presents to Aanam were thoughtful, useful and good, Aanam\u2019s presents to Aditi genuinely felt like an afterthought. I am not on Instagram so don\u2019t know what went down there, but apparently Aanam has been getting a lot of \u201chate\u201d for the same. Now she says people are making materialistic comparison and pitting one girl against another.\n\nMy opinion is that Aanam is just salty that people didn\u2019t appreciate her presents to Quirky, because, if you didn\u2019t want a materialistic comparison of who gave what, just exchange notes in private? What is the need to create content on \u201cgift\u201d exchanging? What do you all think? ",

            "I watched Aanams mystery box from Quirky and honestly never has Aanam looked so greedy. She really had this high horse attitude wherein she thinks that whatever others do for her is justified but when it comes to her, she can do whatever she pleases. And sorry her full disclosure is not really that honest. And, I dont know why but I felt Aanam looked really greedy while opening the boxes. She looked extremely materialistic.",
