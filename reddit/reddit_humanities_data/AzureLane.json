Twitter binding will no longer be supported by the end of 2023.\n* EN players can bind via Twitter account, Facebook account or Yostar account. Recommended to use Yostar Account due to uncertainty with Twitter and Facebook. These options are in [Settings](https://i.imgur.com/thwmHwZ.jpg).\n* Use at least one account bind option; use multiple if you want to be safe.\n* If your device is lost, damaged, or a game update breaks the app and forces you to reinstall you could permanently lose your account.\n* EN accounts are easiest to recover with an account bind; make sure to bind your account in the settings and only use the login screen binding buttons to reconnect your account.\n* Using the login screen buttons without a bound account will create a new account for you and effectively erase your progress with no way of recovering it outside of contacting customer support. JUST DO IT.\n* Make sure you are selecting the correct server and method of binding when using a new device.\n\n**NOTE:** It's also a good idea to remember your server and take a screenshot of your Profile Page so that customer support has an easier time recovering your account.\n\n# Detailed In-depth FAQ can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/wiki/faq/).\n\n# Please read through it first before asking a question in here as the FAQ covers lots of common topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Other Megathreads|\n|:-|\n|[Weekly Lounge Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/search/?q=title%3ALittorio%27s%20Luxurious%20Lounge&restrict_sr=1&sort=new&t=week)|\n|[Guild Recruitment Megathread VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/s/aLCh3jNAY7)|\n|[Wichita META Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1dhoqbi/wichita_meta_thread/)|\n|[World 15 Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/17dndm9/world_15_strategy_megathread/)|",

            "Tried three salvo/airstrike today. Going to use this from now on. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1eBvwGM\n\nI found the timing for yorktown's third airstrike too long with two catapults for helena so I went back to the beacon and it worked better. \n\nHarbin provides enough protection with her smoke to help the rest of your vanguard survive through at least the third salvo and airstrike. Her dps is also quite high so you have some room if you get unlucky.",
            "Had used Guam Laffey II and Plymouth on my CV( YKII, Kear, Implac) fleet. However LVL14 Michita almost killed them with only 15s left. Idk if they can last on LVL15 tho lol. \n\nAnyways you guys have , Interesting comps that you tried?",
            "I wonder, is Mogador's skill glitched again because she can drag herself to Whichita META even when chained (and put Slashed status effect on her).",
            "Here's what worked for me https://imgur.com/a/lRe5HNu\n\nI only got to try kearsarge as flagship once but her getting plymouth's buff is better than alsace getting it. \n\nKearsarge airstrike -> alsace fires and applies debuff -> yorktown launches -> kearsarge fires\n\nYou can swap helena for laffey 2 but it most likely won't one shot. Should be over 1m damage every attempt at least.",

            "What should I even be aiming for fleetwise here,  I'm new and just trying to get a fleet that doesnt make me auto her like a dozen times.",
            "Here is my setup. It's based on NGA suggestion, but slightly modified to fit my playstyle. Kear + Y2 + Implacable, Sirius + LII + Ply. ~1M damage average on auto.\n\n(1) I prioritised comfy clearing and consistent damage rather than a high-damage ceiling. So, no Helena.\n\n(2) All at Lv125, but no one is oathed. My RLD stat is almost max though (+15 for BB, +36 for CV).\n\n(3) The most important point is LII need to stay at least until the last airstrikes hit (roughly until 00:10, but the last rockets will hit at 00:05 on my attempt). I'm banking on LII + Manjuu tankiness.\n\n[Formation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1115652262505762930/1253616997174874132/Azur_Lane_2024-06-21-14-29-29.jpg?ex=6676814f&is=66752fcf&hm=75d1bdea4fbd6c669a0935fc430729816a7e6ac49d0d537c3a0eb70b3eebe45e&).
