            "\"We're going to cut down this tree! Oh, please try to stop us. Oh, pretty please try.\" - The US.\n\nSeriously though, if I'd been a Korean trooper watching the US direct that many resources just to cut down a tree, I'd have serious second thoughts about partaking in the war.",
            "The\u00a0**Korean axe murder incident**\u00a0was the killing of two\u00a0[United Nations Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command)\u00a0officers, Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett, by North Korean soldiers on August 18, 1976, in the\u00a0[Joint Security Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Security_Area)\u00a0(JSA) in the\u00a0[Korean Demilitarized Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone)\u00a0(DMZ). The officers, from the United States Army, had been part of a work party cutting down a poplar tree in the JSA.\n\nThree days later, US and South Korean forces launched\u00a0**Operation Paul Bunyan**, an operation that cut down the tree with a show of force to intimidate North Korea into backing down, which occurred.\n\nOperation Paul Bunyan was carried out on August 21 at 07:00, three days after the killings. A convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles (\"Task Force Vierra,\" named after\u00a0[Lieutenant Colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel)\u00a0Victor S. Vierra, commander of the United States Army Support Group) drove into the JSA without any warning to the North Koreans, who had one observation post staffed at that hour. In the vehicles were two eight-man teams of military engineers (from the\u00a0[2nd Engineer Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Engineer_Battalion_(United_States)), 2nd Infantry Division) equipped with\u00a0[chainsaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw)\u00a0to cut down the tree.\n\nThe teams were accompanied by two 30-man security platoons from the Joint Security Force, who were armed with pistols and axe handles. The 1st Platoon secured the northern entrance to the JSA via the Bridge of No Return, while the 2nd Platoon secured the southern edge of the area.\n\nConcurrently, a team from B Company, commanded by Captain Walter Seifried, had activated the detonation systems for the charges on\u00a0[Freedom Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imjingak)\u00a0and had the\u00a0[165mm main gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ordnance_L9)\u00a0of the\u00a0[M728 combat engineer vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M728_Combat_Engineer_Vehicle)\u00a0aimed mid-span to ensure that the bridge would fall if the order was given for its destruction. Also, B Company, supporting E Company (bridge), were building M4T6 rafts on the\u00a0[Imjin River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imjin_River)\u00a0if the situation required emergency evacuation by that route.\n\nIn addition, a 64-man task force of the\u00a0[ROK Army 1st Special Forces Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Special_Forces_Brigade_(South_Korea))\u00a0accompanied them, armed with clubs and trained in\u00a0[taekwondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo), supposedly without firearms. However, once they parked their trucks near the Bridge of No Return, they started throwing out the sandbags that lined the truck bottoms and handing out\u00a0[M16 rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle)\u00a0and\u00a0[M79 grenade launchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher)\u00a0that had been concealed below them.[^(\\[4\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_axe_murder_incident#cite_note-2koreas-4)\u00a0Several of the commandos also had\u00a0[M18 Claymore mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M18_Claymore_mine)\u00a0strapped to their chests with the firing mechanism in their hands, and were shouting at the North Koreans to cross the bridge.",
            "Adding on that North Korea immediately began lying and playing victim; saying that it was an unprovoked attack by the UN officers and that the US should withdraw from South Korea.\n\nThe Conference of Non- Aligned Nations agreed.\n\nHonestly if North Korea told me the sky was blue I'd get the sudden urge to check.\n\nP.S. The NK officer was known as 'The Bulldog' and was known to pick fights.",
            "This incident is one of the most satisfying shows of force I've heard of. Although there's always plenty to criticize, the US/UN intervention in Korea is one of the few post-ww2 US military adventures that actually had a definitely positive impact.\u00a0",
            "That time we gave North Korea the ultimate in FAFO.",
            "Oh, look, it's [a relevant Tom Scott video](https://youtu.be/vs3XJTYli10)...",
            "I remember watching a video about this event from a YouTuber called A Grain of Salt. Pretty underrated channel if you\u2019re into niche and weird history.",
            "When was it? Kim Jong-il (the first \"glorious Kim Jong\") was an infant during the Korean war and came to power as late as the 90s.\n\nDo you maybe mean \"the glorious Kim Il-sung\"",
            "Lmfao, using literally Blue Jay\u2019s video is a great choice",
            "Iv heard/seen this story multiple times and I don\u2019t think the US/South Korea are the victors. The US had 2 soldiers murdered and the best revenge they could get was cutting down a tree. I don\u2019t care if they cut down every tree within 100 miles of the DMZ, the North Koreans were able to kill 2 American officers without any real repercussions."

            "George B McClellan has some wild ties to Washington State as well.\u00a0\n\nHe was commissioned by the then Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in 1853 to find a passage across the Cascade Mountains, a job which he did pretty terribly at. The locations he picked were generally not viable and worse still, better routes would exist nearby.\n\nEventually after basically refusing to do his job governor Isaac Stevens would eventually demand he hand over his log books, which McClellan refused to do. As it turned out, McClellan wrote at length about how much he hated his bosses and how misunderstood he was. He was apparently reluctant to turn over said books out of embarrassment. Some seriously angsty shit apparently.\u00a0\n\nAside: Isaac Stevens was interesting in his own right, but I want to point out he named his kid Hazard. Hazard Steven\u2019s claim to fame was being the first person to have climbed Mt Rainier, the most prominent mountain, most glaciated point, and tallest volcano in the Lower 48.",

            "To be fair, Mclellan was great at training and building an army. He just wasn\u2019t willing to then put that army in a position where it might be destroyed. As Robert E. Lee correctly (a broken clock is right twice a day) summarized: \u201cTo be a good soldier, you must love the army. To be a good commander, you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love.\u201d",
            "McClellan is interesting because unlike most failed generals, he wasn\u2019t really that bad at leading troops, and was actually a very talented organizer. He failed because he was a perfectionist who refused to engage the enemy. Wanting to save your soldiers\u2019 lives is noble, but meticulous planning and slow action drag out the war, which means more deaths."
