Hemingway fought for the loyalists during the Spanish Civil War, and this experience informed much of his work. The Catastrophe is Kerensky\u2019s account of the Russian Civil War. From Manassas to Appomattox is James Longstreet\u2019s memoir of the US Civil War. Inside the Third Reich is Albert Speer\u2019s very self serving memoir of his time in the Nazi government (take this one with a giant grain of salt). Thucydides was an Athenian general during the Peloponnesian war.",

You're only allowed to visit her twice or thrice a year or you can bribe your way into her chamber, but that would not be cheep cause there tons of eunuchs, court ladies to be paid off. You also banned from having concubine. So nearly all your life pleasure is stripped away from you so that you can brag that you are in-law to the emperor.",
