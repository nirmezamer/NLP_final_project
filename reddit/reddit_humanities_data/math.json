You might be able to find places where you could be accepted, but it is harder to make a career as a professor from a less well-regarded program.\n\nAs for the masters, I would suggest shopping around, looking for places which have good placements into US PhD programs and opportunities for funding.",

            "Hey, I\u2019m a high school math tutor and I\u2019m planning to study math in university.\nOne of the teachers at the school keeps telling me to study comp-sci or electrical engineering so i could get a job that\u2019s not being a gish school teacher. \n\ni\u2019m gonna do the math degree any-how but i was wondering what kind of jobs do you guys have, especially if you\u2019re fresh out of bachelor\u2019s",
            "TL;DR not a great GPA in undergrad 4 years ago, and potentially only decent rec letters, so need advice on becoming a more attractive candidate for Ph.D. programs\n\nI got a B.S. in Math from a decent university (AMS Group II) and got a 3.36 GPA overall, with my math classes averaging out at about 3.29 GPA, so nothing super crazy. I did an undergraduate guided reading course (can't really call it research but it was 1-1 with a professor) and that went okay, but I'm not super proud of it. I could've done much better, but my work ethic was terrible and I had my sights on other things at that point.\n\nThat was 4 years ago. Since then, I've gotten a job in web development and honed my work ethic, and I'm ready to pursue a Ph.D., but obviously I'm not the most attractive candidate on paper. I think I'll be able to get decent recs from two professors (one of which being my thesis professor), and I'll probably be able to find someone else to write me one, though it'll probably be pretty barebones.\n\nWhat can I do to improve my chances? I'm spending just about all my free time on math outside of my job, but obviously that doesn't count for much since it'll just become part of my personal statement. My goal is to become a professor, and I'm prepared to do the crazy stuff necessary to get there (low pay, moving, postdocs, etc.). I want to get into the best school I can so I'll have a shot. One option I've considered is applying for a funded masters at a school near me (decent university, but not in any of the AMS \"Groups\") so that I can have a better GPA and set of professor relationships. Is that a good idea? Any other ideas?",
            "Hi everyone!\n\nI got my bachelor's in applied math in 2020 and have been working as a high school math teacher for the past three years. I'm currently teaching AP Calculus. \n\nWhile I enjoy my job and find it fulfilling, I am looking to pivot careers. Truth be told, I want to pursue a career with a higher salary to better provide for my family.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here has transitioned from math education to another field. I'm interested in possibly pursuing a career in ML/AI engineering, but I'm a bit discouraged by news of tech layoffs, which makes it seem like it's not the best time to enter that field.\n\nAny suggestions on career options for a high school math teacher? Thanks!",
            "Hello! So there are two courses in the math dept. of a reputed uni in my country (India). One is B.Sc Honors Math and the other is B.Sc Honors Math and Computing. The math and computing degree is almost the same as the pure math degree, except that it a few math courses are replaced by computer courses. Computer courses are C, Python, Data Strictures, AI, Data Analytics. As a result, the Math and Computing Degree doesn't have Number theory, Measure theory, PDE, Advanced DE, which the pure math degree has. And I can't take these math courses as electives under the course structure of the math and computing degree\n\nI'm highly ambitious of applying to and getting in a good math grad school in the US after my 4 year degree.\n\nFirst of all, after completing pure math degree even with undergrad research internships\\\\projects, landing a funded math grad school in US is still very hyper competitive, especially if one is international. So, chances are low to begin with, and if one misses out and one has no backup, then one will have a very very difficult time in job hunting as the pure math degree in itself is not directly employable here, thus having low to none market value as compared to other industry relevant degrees.\n\nThus, if I go for math and computing degree, it will at least give me a security of entry into tech job sector in case my US phd plans don't work out.\n\n1) Am I taking the right step by choosing the math and computing degree over the simply math degree\n\n2) So, my question is if I do the math and computing degree, and miss out on Number theory, Measure theory, PDE, Advanced DE courses, will it negatively affect my US math grad school applications?\n\nI'd be really thankful for help\\\\opinion on (1) and (2). Please do guide me here."

        "content": "I am currently writing my PhD dissertation, and I have been working on a particularly complex proof for the last few days. The proof involves a quite involved construction, then proving some properties of the constructed object, refining the construction again, and proving some more properties of the result; along with a few other intermediate steps. I would like to split the proof into several logical parts, so that it is more organized and easier to read than just pages of running text, notation, and figures.\n\nHowever, the different sections of the proofs are not really lemmas: they don't deal with some individually important small results, instead they reference and require objects built in the previous parts of the same construction. They are not really claims: while some of the logical segments claim various things, others describe new objects to be constructed or solutions to issues that may arise. Each of the sections spans multiple paragraphs, so paragraph breaks are not the solution either.\n\nI have tried restructuring the proof into several logically independent claims; in fact the section I am writing right now is already only one such fragment (though the largest by far) of a longer discussion. I don't think it can be broken down any further.\n\nIdeally I would like to insert a line of text or some other note that would indicate, \"Dear reader, at this moment, take a breather and process what you have just read in the previous section. When you are satisfied with your understanding of the construction so far, continue reading again, as we are going to do New Stuff.\"\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how something like this can be done?

Good luck.",

This can give the reader the \"big picture\" before going in to the details and that way they'll understand where all these weird results are going.",

For each section, it can help to do a sketch/road map at the beginning and a summary at the end. Since you've been thinking about this object and it's properties for so long, a lot of stuff may feel obvious or redundant to you, but it's really nice to just be very explicit and reiterate the key ideas. Even experienced readers will appreciate good exposition. \n\nFocus on readability, not logical independence.",
