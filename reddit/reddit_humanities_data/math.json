            "Hey there. I figured out what I think is a cool equation, and I was wondering if had a name. Here\u2019s the equation:\n\ny=+-(c1xln(x)+c2x+c3)\nWhere c1, c2, and c3 are constants and c1/=0.\n\nThe reason this equation is cool is that the y-intercept of the line tangent to the equation goes from -infinity to infinity at a constant rate as you move along the graph at a constant rate.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to figure this out, so does anyone know if this has a name? And if so, does it have any practical applications?\n\nA little background if anyone\u2019s curious, I started think about this when I was driving my car a while ago. The driver in front of me was driving terribly, so I wanted to look in their side window and see who was driving. But then they turned at such an angle while I kept going straight, such that I could only ever see the back of the car. Then I started to wonder what curve they would have to take such that I could only ever see the back of their car, assuming we both kept going at a constant speed, and I kept driving in a straight line. And then the above equation is what I got when I sat down to figure it out.",

Going off of the topological definition, any preimage of an open ball in Y will either be an open ball in X, or a \"half-ball\" being cut off at the boundary of B\u2081(0,0). However since that boundary is not in X by its definition, the pre-image is still open.\n\nIs the given example wrong or am I missing something?",

Seeking advice on feasibility, areas to focus on, specialization selection, and improving my chances of acceptance.**\n\nI'm considering applying for master's programs in pure mathematics good universities in Europe (excluding the UK), such as Bonn, Uni of Pisa , ETH Z, EPFL, TUM, Uni of Vienna, etc. However, my bachelor's degree focused heavily on applied mathematics, statistics, and some physics.\n\nAcademic Background:\n\nI completed a bachelor's degree in statistics, with mathematics and physics as my minors. My coursework included calculus (including multivariable), linear algebra, differential equations, statistics, and physics (thermodynamics, quantum mechanics etc.)\n\nI'm particularly interested in understanding the following:\n\n- How feasible is it to transition from an applied mathematics background to studying pure mathematics at the graduate level, especially for top universities in Europe?\n- Are there specific areas of pure mathematics that I should focus on strengthening my knowledge in before applying to these programs?\n- Do good EU universities with a low acceptance rate like Bonn, ETH , EPFL etc., welcome applicants with applied mathematics backgrounds who want to pursue pure mathematics?\n- Considering my background, would it be more advisable to apply for applied mathematics master's programs initially and then shift towards pure mathematics if possible?\n\nAdditionally, my counselor has advised me to mention my desired specialization in my SOP as it increases the chances of admission, but since I've just started learning higher level pure math subjects, I'm unsure which specialization to select. Is there a quick and easy way to determine which higher-level math subjects you truly like if you don't know much about them yet?\n\nDo I actually have a chance of getting into these good universities with my current background? Is there anything I can do to improve my chances?

            "It sounds like your bachelor is in the US? I think you have very little chance for top programs. With zero analysis and algebra background, you\u2019d even have trouble being taken seriously by pure math masters programs in the US, not to mention Europe. Even if you manage to get in, you will have an exceedingly hard time surviving the program, since most students will be way ahead of you: their bachelors usually cover the first year of US grad school math if not more. Your math background (minus stats&physics) is covered in European high schools and maybe first year. Even applied math in Europe requires rigorous training in foundational topics like analysis. You should aim for a transitional/remedial masters/postbac program in the US instead. But it is possible that you eventually will rely on your statistical background to get jobs since a masters in pure math doesn\u2019t open many new doors.\n\nOnce you acquire US first year grad level of math (measure theory, algebraic topology, etc) on transcript, then you will have a chance of getting in. But even for qualified students, their programs and math culture are very different from that of US that many US students can still struggle immensely. I would not recommend European masters for typical US students unless you have very good reasons.",

I've got a year before starting my master's, so I think I will cover a lot by then (please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nWill universities still see me as lacking knowledge in these subjects even after my self-study efforts?

Unfortunately I believe Europe admission works the same way as the US on unofficial self-studying: they don\u2019t count, unless you are self-learning under the supervision of a (well-established) mathematician that can write you a glowing reference letter. Otherwise you need them to be on your transcript. They have good reasons: there is no way to evaluate your mastery of the materials unless you take it as a structured course with a syllabus detailing the content and evaluation methods. It\u2019s commendable that you have so much passion for learning pure math. You might want to aim for less competitive programs (especially in the US) designed for non-major enthusiasts like yourself."

            "Time limits. It\u2019s very hard to test your mathematical ability in an exam lasting 1.5 hours. The most ideal way to go about everything is have one on one oral exams with your professor \u2026 but this is basically impossible in most cases because of time and money restrictions.

            "I've taught at a low-income school for 4 years. I try to assign a mix of tests and projects. Unfortunately, if we don't have quizzes every 2 weeks or so, the kids don't learn how to actually do the calculations. They skip the homework or copy it off their friends; they mimic the example projects and change like 1 thing; they over-rely on technology; they don't take notes.\n\nThere is value in having a mix, I think. Exams encourage the *automaticity* you need to really succeed in mathematics, and projects give you a better idea of what real-world math actually looks like.\n\nI found your \"capitalism\" comment rather silly because exams are older than capitalism. The first standardized exams go back to the Sui Dynasty (the year 605 CE), long before capitalism even existed. Those imperial examinations were used to select government officials.\n\nIn any meritocracy, you need safeguards against incompetence that cannot be sidestepped, faked, or cheated. Exams are very good at that.",
            "What alternative metric are you proposing for measuring mathematical ability? To be blunt, if you can't do a particular style of problem on demand, then your ability *is* incomplete in that area. Of all the domains humans endeavor to teach, mathematical ability is one of the easiest to measure and one of the hardest to fake. \n\nEdit: and just to clarify, you are very correct suggesting that many degrees are awarded based on metrics other than actual competency. I'm curious to know if you think it is the method or the system applying the method that's broken.",
            "I think that sometimes people get confused about what exams are testing them on.  If you learn the underlying reasons and methods for something, then you can apply the strategies, algorithms, etc. required for the questions.  If you only learn the algorithms, then yes it will seem like regurgitating instead of learning and being truly tested.\n\nOnce you get to upper-level math classes, definitions become very important and a lot less actual computation is done/tested on.  It might feel like these exams are asking you to regurgitate definitions.  The reality is, these definitions are fundamental to ensuring a proper foundation necessary to understand the rest (i.e. in linear algebra, abstract algebra, higher-level differential equations, etc).",
            "you chose to rote learn exam answers and then blame it on capitalism",
            "In some countries oral exams are quite common for graduate courses. In those it is often easier to check if a student understood the content instead of testing if he/she can solve certain problem sets. \nBut for undergraduate level this is quite hard but I also think on the basic bachelor level written exams are good enough to test the understanding.",
            "This might be a matter of approach. I'm a CS student, and had to take a few math courses. To this day, I use, apply, and understand every single thing I learned in those classes 3 years ago. Regurgitation feels more like a characteristic of high school math, which doesn't require as much thought and understanding. In my eyes, a good test (such as the ones I took) doesn't benefit from intense memorization, but instead requires an understanding of the subject, which, once formed, tends to stay. The few classes I truly hated during my undergrad were mainly the ones that were just a test of memory (I still have nightmares from Introduction to Operating Systems), but I can still solve a Linear Algebra 2 exam without preparation, since I remember the main theorems, and understand the rest. This is partially dependent on the professor, and of course it's reliant on the curriculum, but if you have a chance to form an understanding of the subject, you can maybe even enjoy mathematics. I know that I might be speaking without seeing the full picture since I'm just an undergrad, but I feel like all you need is one good professor to love the study of math.",
            "I agree with you directionally, but I don't share the strength of your opinion.\n\nFundamentally, I think you're right; one's ability to answer five questions in 50 minutes or whatever is not really a good indicator of how good they are or will be at math. In an ideal world grades would only depend on homework, but it's so easy to cheat these days that if you base grades solely on homework then you're basically creating an arms race between students to cheat more and more. So, there needs to be a way to verify that the work a student is doing is truly their own, and as far as I can tell the only way to really do that is to physically watch the students do the work by themselves.\n\nI've been noticing a little bit of a trend in recent years to start doing away with time restrictions on exams. This I think has a handful of logistical issues, but in the grand scheme of things I think those are fairly minor compared to what is gained.",

If you give up without understanding you'll drag those misunderstandings along and, when they have accumulated enough, undermine your comprehension of basically anything related. For people who start doing that at an early age, with fractions or trigonometry for example, this prevents entire careers in anything vaguely scientific.",
            "A first linear algebra course should be hard. If it's easy, like just a bunch of matrix calculations, you're not learning linear algebra. There is a video series called \"The Essence of Linear Algebra\" by 3blue1brown that helps a lot of people. Try it out. See if it helps you with your exercises.\n\nSkipping exercises, especially early ones, is a mistake. Later exercises in a problem set may be challenging you to think a little a harder. Do them. You aren't in a race. You have plenty of time to learn. If your friends are learning faster than you, ask them for help. If you're learning faster than them, help them. Mathematics is a social game despite what you may have read in books. Mathematicians get problems from each other and solve them together.",
            "The only way to truly understand something is with exercises, and lots of them until you are confident doing it. We often think we understand a concept while reading theory, but exercises are a good check to see what we have actually learned"
