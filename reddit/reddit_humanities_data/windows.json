This subreddit no longer accepts tech support requests outside of this post, if you are looking for additional assistance try r/TechSupport and r/WindowsHelp.\n\n\nSome examples of questions to ask:\n\n- Is this super cheap Windows key legitimate? (probably not)\n\n- How can I install Windows 11?\n\n- Can you recommend a program to play music?\n\n- How do I get back to the old Sound Control Panel?\n\nSorting by New is recommend and is the default.\n\n----\n\nBe sure to check out the [Windows 11 version 22H2 Launch Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/xj877b/windows_11_version_22h2_build_22621_launch/) and also the [Windows 11 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/faq) posts, they likely have the answers to your Windows 11 questions already!",

            "I have a program that can only be resized by dragging from the bottom, but with me being unable to move the task bar at the bottom in windows 11, I cant resize it. Is there a way around this?",
            "Can't activate Windows after reinstall\n\nI've bought a Samsung 990 Pro SSD and a new Windows 11 Pro key when I first got my G14. After recently finding out that Bitlocker was only using software encryption, I was forced to reinstall the OS again to enable hardware encryption. Now Windows claims it's unable to activate, even after manually typing in my own key because \"it looks like the hardware on this device has changed\" when it definitely hasn't. Now looking at the product key on the bottom of that settings page, it clearly seems to insist on using what seems like the original key that was preinstalled with my G14 which was for the Home edition and it's not letting me replace it with my Pro key due to the error message above.",
            "I've got a US keyboard layout as it's a 65% size, is there a way of mapping Ctrl+<a key> to output \\\\ for instance and Ctrl+shift+<a key> = |\n\n  \nUsing the registry if at all possible. \n\n  \nI've got sharp keys but that looks like it can only do 1 to 1 replacements?",
            "Simple question but.. way back when 3.1 and 95/98 were still in active use. People could use animated GIF for wallpaper and it'd work. Then Microsoft said no more and blocked that with XP I think. I recall hearing claim that animated GIF wallpaper on XP and later would be too demanding on CPU.\n\nToday's computer has enough power to emulate Pentium III and Windows XP yet we still can't use animated GIF or APNG for wallpaper without needing 3rd party program.\n\nWhat was the real reason Microsoft blocked the animated GIF in the first place?  And what would you suggest for animated wallpaper for W11? I want to use 2 different large GIFs (if you're familiar with trippy art from P Robertson, those GIFs!!) and have them stretched out on 2 monitors.",
            "I hope this is the right place to ask this, had a lot of trouble finding a firm answer to this question.\n\nI've been trying to adjust my UAC to always require credentials to be entered, even for Admin accounts. I am trying to avoid KeyStroke Injection and the simple Yes/No prompt required by Admin level accounts seems weak against this. Is this a legitimate concern? And if so, how can I force UAC to always require administrator credentials to be entered?\n\nThank you in advance for any assistance.",
            "I could use some help.\n\nFor some reason after my PC randomly shut down and updated Windows on its own while in the middle of playing a game, my Windows keeps creating these empty Notepad files on my desktop labelled \"log\" with a bunch of numbers after.\n\nIs there a setting I can turn off to prevent this? Its pretty annoying. They get created at random and not after I do anything specific.",
            "I\u2019m not sure if this is a simple question or not because I\u2019m not really educated much in this area. But the wifi option in my laptop has disappeared for two days in a row now, both times I did a network reset which was what the troubleshooter told me to do. The second time it didnt work, so now I\u2019m worried about the potential indications this has for my device as it\u2019s the only one I have and I\u2019m starting college soon.",
            "Don't see anyone elses questions being answered but Imma try anyway since its really simple:\n\nShould I upgrade to windows 11?\n\nBasically since theres about a year left of win 10 support I got a popup about it that told me Im not eligible for win 11 even though the windows settings has said I am since windows 11 started, but I've heard mixed opinions about it so I've been putting it off since win 10 works, but now that we are getting closer to ended support I may just have to upgrade\n\nanyway yea dumb question ik but at least im not making a full post about it",
            "Hello. I want to factory reset Windows 11. But when I click on reset, a key code appears that needs to be typed. The problem is that the first part of the code has a few letters, but letters cannot be typed there, only numbers.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1 - Why do I need to type this code? Previous Windows did not require any key codes for the reset .\n\n2 - Do I need to skip the small part with letters and enter only the part with numbers, or it is a bug?",
            "I really like the virtual desktop on windows and utilize 2 or 3 at a time. However, the control+windows+arrow key is too much to quickly and easily go back and forth between them.  I have a mouse that has a scroll wheel that I can push both left and right. Is there anyway to make that left and right click (or any of the few side buttons on the mouse) flip me between virtual desktops?"

I always use open office for word but aside for that, it feels like a losing battle. Eventually windows is going to try to get you to pay monthly to use the operating system or something similar. i can just feel it.\n",
