This subreddit no longer accepts tech support requests outside of this post, if you are looking for additional assistance try r/TechSupport and r/WindowsHelp.\n\n\nSome examples of questions to ask:\n\n- Is this super cheap Windows key legitimate? (probably not)\n\n- How can I install Windows 11?\n\n- Can you recommend a program to play music?\n\n- How do I get back to the old Sound Control Panel?\n\nSorting by New is recommend and is the default.\n\n----\n\nBe sure to check out the [Windows 11 version 22H2 Launch Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/xj877b/windows_11_version_22h2_build_22621_launch/) and also the [Windows 11 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/faq) posts, they likely have the answers to your Windows 11 questions already!",

            "I have a program that can only be resized by dragging from the bottom, but with me being unable to move the task bar at the bottom in windows 11, I cant resize it. Is there a way around this?",
            "Can't activate Windows after reinstall\n\nI've bought a Samsung 990 Pro SSD and a new Windows 11 Pro key when I first got my G14. After recently finding out that Bitlocker was only using software encryption, I was forced to reinstall the OS again to enable hardware encryption. Now Windows claims it's unable to activate, even after manually typing in my own key because \"it looks like the hardware on this device has changed\" when it definitely hasn't. Now looking at the product key on the bottom of that settings page, it clearly seems to insist on using what seems like the original key that was preinstalled with my G14 which was for the Home edition and it's not letting me replace it with my Pro key due to the error message above.",
            "I\u2019m not sure if this is a simple question or not because I\u2019m not really educated much in this area. But the wifi option in my laptop has disappeared for two days in a row now, both times I did a network reset which was what the troubleshooter told me to do. The second time it didnt work, so now I\u2019m worried about the potential indications this has for my device as it\u2019s the only one I have and I\u2019m starting college soon.",
            "I really like the virtual desktop on windows and utilize 2 or 3 at a time. However, the control+windows+arrow key is too much to quickly and easily go back and forth between them.  I have a mouse that has a scroll wheel that I can push both left and right. Is there anyway to make that left and right click (or any of the few side buttons on the mouse) flip me between virtual desktops?",
            "I have a Windows 10 Home key I am going to deactivate on my dual-boot macbook to use on my new custom PC.\n\nOn the new PC, can I fresh install Windows 11 Home and use the 10 key? Or do I have to start with 10, activate, then upgrade to 11?",
            "when do we actually get reviews of the arm snapdragon laptops?",
            "My phone does not allow data to be transfered. This \"do you trust this computer\" pop up window never appears or does not work when I do agree. IPhone 12 mini, does that have something to do with it being a work phone?",
            "Why is my Windows 11 install showing location as: \"Microsoft Data Center Boydton, Herbert Dr, Boydton, VA 23917\" - I live in Canada",
            "Hey all! when I use the window directional snapping keys, Win+[Arrow keys] the windows have defaulted to snapping to the left quarter, middle half, and right quarter. This is changed within the last year it seems. I have until this change been able to snap to the right-half and left-half. Is there a way to get it back or should I just make the switch to Win+Z?",
            "I desperatly need help. Everytime i open my pc it blue screens about 1-3 times. I have tried everything but nothing works. My pc is a pre-build."

            "I guess it really depends on what you want to do with it. Just browsing internet, email and some word documents, upgrading to Windows 11 or Windows 10 will help you improve some (very little) performance.\n\n...HOWEVER, considering the upgrade isn't free anymore, why upgrade the OS?? Use that money to get into a used i7 10th gen and you have a much greater upgrade. My 2 cents.",
