Why is Biden the Democratic nominee? What are the chances of Trump winning? Why can Trump even run for president if he's in legal trouble? There are lots of good questions! But, unfortunately, it's often the *same* questions, and our users get tired of seeing them. \n\nAs we've done for past topics of interest, we're creating a megathread for your questions so that people interested in politics can post questions and read answers, while people who want a respite from politics can browse the rest of the sub. **Feel free to post your questions about politics in this thread!** \n\nAll top-level comments should be questions asked in good faith - other comments and loaded questions will get removed. All the usual rules of the sub remain in force here, so **be civil to each other** \\- you can disagree with someone's opinion, but don't make it personal.",

            "If conservatives want a smaller, less controlling government, why do most of them advocate for very controlling ideas? Most of them dislike homosexuality, abortions (sometimes birth control), certain religions, etc and sometimes actively protest against it. Some of them are even anti-free speech despite claiming not to be. Doesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose of a less controlling government?",
            "Do conservatives really not notice the grifting? There\u2019s all this Trump merchandise directed at them, coins, gold mugshots, stuffed animals, posters, shirts, flags, and the hats, of course. Don\u2019t conservatives notice no one is selling paintings of shirtless Biden with giant muscles? There\u2019s no \u201cGet your limited edition solid gold Biden dollar.\u201d Don\u2019t conservatives feel targeted as easy marks by these things?",
            "Why do a lot of americans want a criminal as their president? I mean Europe has had their share of crooked politicians but when they get exposed and convicted their public support drops and they tend to get kicked out of their party. Because we have, you know, standards, for our politicians.",
            "If Biden had the chance why didn\u2019t he codify Roe v. Wade, why?? Why didn\u2019t Obama? It always seems when the Dems can really out their foot down they just don\u2019t. Am I crazy?",
            "Why are people willing to vote against their own financial interests over social issues?",
            "What will happen to the Republican party if Trump loses this election? He has basically completed his takeover with the shenanigans at the RNC. I don't even know if Trump has enough life left in him to last to 2028 and without him, the MAGA movement is basically a wash.",
            "Why makes people believe anything Trump says when his entire career has been based on lies? The first time I learned of him, long before he entered politics, it was clear to me that he was a con man.  I understand he says what certain people want to hear but what makes you actually, truly believe him?",
            "Do votes in the primaries have any effect on the general election? I keep hearing ppl online saying \u201cif you vote for someone other than Biden, it\u2019s a vote for Trump.\u201d But if I vote for someone other than Biden in the primaries, and they don\u2019t move on and Biden does, I can just vote for him in the general election then instead of Trump right?",
            "So.. How do you vote for president? (US)\n\nEmbarrassing.. but this is something I was never taught in school or with family. What all is needed to go and vote? Where am I supposed to go to vote? What time this year are you supposed to vote?\n\nPlease go easy I'm just a young person thrown into the world still trying to figure out life \ud83e\udee3\n\nEdit to include that I am in Arkansas.. thank you everyone for the help!",
            "Can someone clearly state facts as to why trumps trial was rigged? I\u2019m moderate. I\u2019ve voted both sides of the aisle. And even 3rd party.  But the rhetoric against our institutions are very concerning."

        "content": "I have nearly zero life experience, and I turn 25 in November. I know there aren't any rules to life, and that people do things at different speeds, but I know I've missed out on what most people consider normal, average experiences. \n\nFor example: I've never been in any romantic or sexual relationship. Never been on a date, kissed someone, or held anyones hand. I never had friends as a kid/teen/young adult, and was quite literally isolated and shut in most of my life. Never went to any big parties, I've never gone to any bars, never had a night out drinking or anything like that. The past couple of years I've made a few friends which is nice. I dropped out in tenth grade, never finished school or got any higher education, last time I had a job was when I was 17. I never ever really hung out with friends in my childhood, I have no experiences or accomplishments to my name. \n\nI honestly feel so pathetic and like a loser. I don't see any of this changing any time soon, and I know that I'm never going to get this time back and will never get to experience some of these things. Not for a lack of trying - some of this was caused by trauma or other circumstances (for example I'm autistic which makes the social aspect of things hard) but I'm so saddened and embarrassed by myself. How normal is my experience? I dont even have many online friends. 90% of my life ive been alone",

            "There\u2019s never a bad time to begin living. You\u2019re only 25. You can get back on your feet",
            "There is not a single person I know, let alone on earth, who doesn\u2019t feel they missed out on something or feel they screwed something up.\n\nI have a friend who got married at the age of 22 and feels that he wishes he could have been single in his 20s.\n\nI have friends who are single in their 30s who wish they found someone when they were younger, or regret breaking up with a person over something trivial.\n\nI know people who wished they travelled after high school instead of jump into post secondary and people who wished they didn\u2019t fuck around and go into college to get it done right away.\n\nI will be honest, on average these things you wish are a bit late, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are a failure or a fuck up. What this means is that you have a unique experience and life that is specifically yours, just like everyone else. \n\nYou, like everyone else needs to remember you are not a summation of your fuck ups and failures but a human having an experience in a weird, crazy, messy world. You are ok, you are you, and that should always be enough.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible what a person can do in a matter of years, but we are trained to think about how our successes and failures matter in days and weeks. \n\nLook at what you said that you wished you could get. There is options to start any of those things. When it comes to social skills, there\u2019s tons of videos on YouTube to learn from and classes that adults can take. It may take some research. Finding a job is as simple as starting a hobby and opening an Etsy shop, or going to an employment centre. Dating requires making a profil online, or at the very least, working up the courage to go and say hi to a stranger that is walking by, not caring what happens regardless of the outcome.\n\nI\u2019m not saying anything I mentioned above is easy, but life is not meant to be. The things we want shouldn\u2019t be easy to obtain. If they were, you wouldn\u2019t regret not having them in your life.\n\nTomorrow is always another day. Learn to be friends with failure (because failure is inevitable, and that is ok). Be kind to yourself. Be patient to yourself. Make a list, and just try something new.\n\nYou got this.",
            "Can I ask what you\u2019ve been doing between the ages of 17 and 25/now if you haven\u2019t been working or going to school or socializing? This is not judgmental - I think this would be helpful in guiding you.",
            "Fellow autist who also bummed around for years doing nothing until around 25/26.\n\nNever too late to begin working on yourself or getting those experiences. Different people take different routes through life. There's no milestones to hit. Just start being in motion, life-wise, and try to keep an eye out for opportunities to do or try new things, and you'll begin to change and things will begin to happen.\n\nI'm about to turn 28 and my life and prospects look very, very different to how they were when I was 25.",
            "There\u2019s a saying that goes something like, \u201cWe\u2019re actually born with 2 lives, the second begins when we realize we only have one.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re not behind in life and you\u2019re not in the lead either. \n\nYou\u2019re alive. \n\nStart living.",
            "Conquering the World",
            "For some people, 25 is the peak of their life, and it all goes downhill from there.\n\nFor many, including myself, the 25 year range is where life really starts. It doesn't matter how far behind you are, the tools we have available to us today can help drive us to success. \n\nThere's no definitive answer to what you should have done by age 25. Some will say you should be married and successful by 25. Some will say you should have life figured out by 25. But do we really know what we're doing by age 25? Hell I'm 26 and I'm still learning things everyday. Things people would tell me I should've learned way earlier. \n\nIt's okay to be behind; it may be more work to catch up on an academic level or professional level, but there are programs and systems in place to help get through that. You aren't a failure for not having life figured out by age 25. What you need to do, however, is figure out what the next step of your life is. You don't have to have everything figured out, but knowing the next move will lead you on a path to what you're looking for. Anybody who gives you shit for where you are in life right now is not someone worth a damn. \n\nI don't think you're pathetic by any means; knowing is half the battle, and if you recognize you need to make a change, you're already well on your way to doing so.",
            "There is no rule of thumb here. Don't look  to the past, look towards the future.\nI've been in similar situations because of cultural differences, how I was raised, the diffent job cultures in different countries.\nThere isn't much you can do except try to change in the future.\nAt a workshop one of my Idols said he lived and thrived with baby steps.\nWhat he meant was, you make the next step possible to you at the moment and keep taking baby steps until you achieve your goal.\nEg. You want to meet someone.\n\nStep one: Look up bars. If that hasn't depleted you take step two. \n\nStep two: visit one. If you still have energy, take step three. And so forth and so on...... \n\nThis concept of baby steps to success blew my mind because it took away alot of pressure because it chunks your goals in such small portions that you can only succeed. \n\nOf course, as with everything you're going to have to evaluate your last and next step to see what is the smallest successful step you can take.",
            "Everyone's experience is different.  Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein by age 18, if you compare your accomplishments to that of others you are always going to see those that \"did more\" because that is what people talk about.  Very few people discuss the lack of things they have done, it's a difficult topic to even try to talk about.\n\nTry taking incremental steps towards the things you want rather than just trying to get there now.  Find a local group for one of your hobbies or interests and try going to one of there events.  You might make some more friends if that is something you want, or you may meet someone there that you might have romantic interest in and vice versa.\n\nMaybe look into organizations that might help with unemployment/finding a job.  That might be a nice change of pace or a sense of community that you may enjoy.\n\nThese are just suggestions, but anything works.  Give yourself goals that you can reasonably accomplish in short time frames.  Focus on what your progress not on what everyone else is doing.  I cannot speak to your past circumstances or trauma and what is best for you based on that.  Depending on that you may want to speak to a therapist, who might be able to help you with that and/or what sort of short term life goals you want to prioritize.\n\nTimes are tough, and though people don't like talking about it much, there are a lot of people with similar circumstances to what you described.  Maybe they have a job but are up to their eyes in debt.  Or maybe they have a degree but but no job experience and so they cannot break into their field.  There are lots of people 25+ who haven't checked certain love life boxes yet.  I am one of them.  Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nHope something here helped, I am rooting for you.",
            "you don\u2019t need to do anything of those things if you\u2019re happy without. I don\u2019t know you, but what you wrote doesn\u2019t make you loser.\nHowever if you want all what you wrote my advice would be go travelling, maybe a foreign country, maybe find a seasonal job, stay in cheap backpackers accomodations.\nIt\u2019s easier to make friends/ connect with people (i mean backpackers of your age) while travelling as everyone is openminded and alone aswell.\nthe most difficult thing about it is booking your very first ticket, after that things just happen by themselves and you gain lots of life experience fast."
