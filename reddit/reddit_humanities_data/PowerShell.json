        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nBefore diving into the core of my post, I\u2019d like to introduce myself. I\u2019m a production engineer with a devops culture/background, boasting over a decade of experience, especially in Windows server environments, though I\u2019m no stranger to Linux.\n\nMy journey with Powershell began 10 years ago, and it quickly became a language I deeply admire. Despite continuously learning new aspects of it, I feel confident enough to consider myself an expert.\n\nMy portfolio of projects with Powershell is extensive. Recently, I\u2019ve ventured into writing my own APIs using Pode and developing web interfaces with Powershell Universal - and it\u2019s been incredibly fulfilling.\n\nI used Powershell for many things : automation, monitoring, data manipulation and injection, playing with Azure and Apis, databases management etc.\n\nBeyond that, I\u2019ve authored my own modules and established CI/CD pipelines for publishing them. \n\nYet, I often find myself feeling misunderstood. Colleagues and peers question my preference for Powershell, citing other market solutions like Ansible, Terraform, and Python [add here any devops tools and language].\n\nAt a crossroads, I\u2019m contemplating a job change. However, the DevOps job market seems to echo the same sentiment - Powershell is not really in demand.\n\nAfter updating my resume and having it reviewed, the feedback was perplexing. \u201cWhy emphasize Powershell so much? It\u2019s not that important,\u201d they said. But to me, it\u2019s crucial. I\u2019ve tackled complex challenges with Powershell that my team couldn\u2019t address.\n\nLately, my passion for Powershell has been waning, and I can\u2019t shake off the feeling that it might be fading into obsolescence.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that Powershell isn\u2019t the solution to everything and shouldn\u2019t be the only solution. It\u2019s not the only skill I possess, but it has enabled me to learn a tons of stuff and solve numerous problems.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is Powershell still relevant in today\u2019s, or is it time for me to adapt to the job market?\n",

            "This seems less about Powershell and more about your career path. If you want to branch out of Microsoft environments, then yeah, you're not gonna need Powershell as much. \n\nHowever, it is still very much relevant and the best solution for anything Azure/Windows/Intune/M365 (in my opinion)",
            "Powershell is the best tool for managing windows and MS365 in bulk.\n\nBut for some specific tasks, there are better tools, in that they don't require the depth of knowledge PS often does to do some intricate things.",
            "Coach for powershell. Theres people out there like me who suck at it and need guidance",
            "Your feedback of \"Why emphasize Powershell so much? Its not that important\" sounds very similar to feedback I received of \"Do you have a life outside of work?\" (after seeing my github contribution history)  I think most people just can't understand having a passion for something, and they don't realise the versatility that it brings you as an engineer.",
            "We use ansible but it runs powershell scripts lol.",
            "I used to love PowerShell and even contributed a small chapter about PowerShell to a community book. Today my job no longer using PowerShell anymore. Its just me who just has an enthusiastic to write scripts and automations. I can say PowerShell was a stepping stone for my career, its very lovely DSL, familiar syntax and easy to understand. So what I think is you just need to decide whether you are like me who actually loves to build automations and scripts where you didnt realising yourself and addicting to PowerShell or just want to be a PowerShell guy and going down the rabbit hole deep into the core of PowerShell.",
            "I've also observed PowerShell the language and related skills not getting the respect it really deserves. I have plenty of first hand experience to see how impressive it can be. Perhaps PowerShell would benefit from better marketing or demonstrations. Until then, the general advice here is correctly, it's wise to supplement those skills with another tool. I've personally found Python to be worthy of the hype. Beyond its great popularity, it's cross platform nature, better performance than PowerShell, and its following a more traditional programming paradigm are worth learning, using, and adding to your resume. I highly recommend learning it sooner than later. I think my heart is big enough to love both languages equally.",
            "Personally I've long felt that MS is putting PowerShell in the backseat. Look at their examples in their documentation and you'll see it's all python, C# and az cli. I'd strongly recommend taking that as an indicator...",
            "Ansible, terraform and python are tools that have their uses. Powershell is a tool that has its uses. \n\nA true craftsman doesnt try to use one tool for all things. Not to mention that most of them can easily interact with the others when needed.",
            "It sounds like Powershell is your hammer and every problem is seen as a nail. I would find it very suspicious too if you were using Powershell for things like API development."
