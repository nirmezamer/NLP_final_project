            "I was setting a boulder on my gym\u2019s spraywall at 10 degrees overhang because my body was feeling weak. On one attempt, I was already pulling on a starting crimp on my left hand when I heard and felt a crunch (not a pop!) from pip to fdp in my left middle finger. I was scared for a minute, but I had no pain or tenderness. Tried palpating the finger, pulling on crimps with my feet on the floor, even doing some hangs on the beastmaker 2000 small edge, but I felt no pain or soreness or tenderness in the finger. Got to the last part of the boulder (don\u2019t know what to do for the finish yet) and still no pain. However I\u2019m still curious as to what it was.",

I know this whole state is ripe with opportunities for all thee hobbies.  But finding good areas that could blend all three is harder to find.\n\nI'd be happy with just offroading and bouldering.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI'm imagining a ideal trip where I do light offroading (forest roads+) out to the back country, get some solid bouldering in, camp by a mountain lake, rinse repeat.",

(Basically dainty chains fixed around your wrist or ankle, with no clasps.)\n\nI want to get an anklet, tightly fitted. Has anyone else climbed with anklets? Are there any problems or safety issues I need to consider? I always take my rings off when I climb, and only wear short necklaces and stud earrings. If it comes down to it I will prioritize climbing over pretty dainty jewelry lol. But am I overthinking it?",
