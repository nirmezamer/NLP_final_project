This thread will be posted again every Friday so there should always be an opportunity to ask your question and have it answered. If you're an experienced climber and want to contribute to the community, these threads are a great opportunity for that. We were all new to climbing at some point, so be respectful of everyone looking to improve their knowledge. Check out our subreddit wiki that has tons of useful info for new climbers. You can see it [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/wiki/beginnersguide)  \n\nSome examples of potential questions could be; \"How do I get stronger?\", \"How to select my first harness?\", or \"How does aid climbing work?\"  \n\nIf you see a new climber related question posted in another subReddit or in this subreddit, then please politely link them to this thread.  \n\n[Check out this curated list of climbing tutorials!](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/6iuccx/rclimbing_lets_curate_a_list_of_climbing_tutorials/)  \n\n[Prior Weekly New Climber Thread posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/search?q=Weekly+New+Climber+Thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  \n\n[Prior Friday New Climber Thread posts (earlier name for the same type of thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/search?q=Friday+New+Climber+Thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  \n\n[A handy guide for purchasing your first rope](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/bc7qke/lets_talk_about_buying_your_first_rope_a_buying)  \n\n[A handy guide to everything you ever wanted to know about climbing shoes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/wiki/shoes)  \n\nAsk away!",

            "Not a question. But recently someone posted to r/memphis  about an abusive employee at Memphis Rox. If you have any experiences please seek out the post. Or tell someone.",
            "I was setting a boulder on my gym\u2019s spraywall at 10 degrees overhang because my body was feeling weak. On one attempt, I was already pulling on a starting crimp on my left hand when I heard and felt a crunch (not a pop!) from pip to fdp in my left middle finger. I was scared for a minute, but I had no pain or tenderness. Tried palpating the finger, pulling on crimps with my feet on the floor, even doing some hangs on the beastmaker 2000 small edge, but I felt no pain or soreness or tenderness in the finger. Got to the last part of the boulder (don\u2019t know what to do for the finish yet) and still no pain. However I\u2019m still curious as to what it was.",
            "Who makes the best climbing brushes these days?\n\nI used to love Sublime, but they went out of business during the pandemic. I haven't found anything that matches them.",
            "Why ate footholds are more slippery when its hot in the climbing gym?",
            "Hi folks! I'm planning a trip to the Canary islands in autumn. Haven't picked the island yet, but it seems that most climbing is on Tenerife and Gran Canaria. My partner and I enjoy both trad and sport, and we'd also love to have some feel-good multipitch climbing in the lower-mid grades (both trad or sport).\n\nI'd be super grateful for any shared experience, or pointers on which island to pick. How's the vibe there, and how good are the guidebooks?",
            "I am currently visiting the US specifically Colorado, Utah and Wyoming for three weeks. I am looking for climbing crags recommendations. Because of the luggage restrictions I only have sport climbing equipment (quickdraws, rope, grigri, cordelette) although I also have experience with trad climbing, I dont know if there are also stores renting equipment? Since I am from EU would be also grateful for any other tips about climbing in the US (ethics, logistics, etc.). Thanks!",
            "Im a good climber but I\u2019m terrified of lead falls and get sloppy on lead because I\u2019m so desperate for a clip. I\u2019ve taken tons of whippers in gyms but outside I haven\u2019t fallen once because I don\u2019t climb the grade I know I can (10c). What are some quick tips? Breathing exercises?",
            "At what grade do I start attracting women with my climbing? Breaking into the 12s outdoors and only men are paying attention to me...what do?",
            "If this *just* happened you should call it for the day. Many of the structures in your hands don't have nerves in them directly, so it's possible the full extent of the injury may not yet be apparent since things haven't become inflamed yet.\n\nEdit to add: It should be said, climbing while under-recovered or feeling weak is prime injury territory due to lack of engagement. Within reason if you're feeling weak and/or tired... take the rest and have a tasty meal.",

Since I\u2019m shit with tech and will probably never create it myself, I\u2019ll just throw my idea at you, ever thought of a variable pitch feature for a hangboard? I\u2019ve thought of a few different ways of doing it, just seems like something fun to add to the old training standby.",
