At the end of the day y'all are just data points in a spreadsheet. That's why nothing will change. Flex will never improve. The routes will never get better. They will find more ways to deny bonuses/guaranteed 40 hrs, etc.\n\nAmazon is happy to eat the enormous driver attrition rate and to pass along the cost to customers. That's because they know a large portion of their customers are habitual buyers. They're shopping addicts and they will all pay an extra dollar or so for the delivery. Amazon is evil, but not more evil than any other company it's size.",
