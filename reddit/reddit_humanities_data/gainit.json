        "content": "People hate this answer. But it's the only answer. Maybe you don't understand the answer?\n\nInstead of asking \"How do I eat more?\", let's ask *\"Eat More WHAT?\"*\n\nSo in no particular order of importance:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n- EAT MORE FOOD. Obvious Goal here. More calories than you burn.\n\n- EAT MORE OFTEN. Now you eat 4-5 meals per day instead of 3 or 2. Stop eating snacks; eat big meals.\n\n- EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. Basically, use all available hours to eat. Fuck intermittent fasting during gaining.\n\n- EAT MORE FATS. Are you avoiding fats trying to not get fat? Fat is fuel & energy. Add oils & fats to meals.\n\n- EAT MORE CARBS. Afraid of \"insulin-stimulated fat storage?!?\" Carbs are easy. Pancakes, Waffles, Pasta.\n\n- EAT MORE FRUIT/VEGETABLES. Stick with citrus fruits & berries for acidity. Some green stuff every day.\n\n- EAT MORE MUSH. Chewed-food takes too long. Ground beef > chicken. Rice or mashed potatoes > bread.\n\n- EAT MORE FLAVORS. Hyper-palatable foods whet your appetite. Use more salt, more garlic and flavor sauces.\n\n- EAT MORE VOLUME. Don't start with a shake; eat a large meal, *then* chase it with a shake. Stretch the stomach.\n\n- EAT MORE PREDICTABLY. Don't wait for hunger. Set 4 consistent meal-times: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm etc.\n\n- EAT MORE QUICKLY/SLOWLY. Chow down with purpose. Eat vigorously. When full, slow down & keep nibbling.\n\n- EAT MORE WATER. Push water in-between meal times. 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm etc. Drink 16-20 ounces water.\n\n- EAT MORE FAMILIAR FOODS. Eat more of what you already eat, more of your favorite and easiest foods.\n\n- EAT MORE SIMPLY. Just track calories and get sufficient protein. Don't obsess about macro ratios/percentages.\n\n- EAT MORE CONSISTENTLY. Some days you don't feel like lifting but do anyways. Hit your food target anyway.\n\n- EAT MORE, DAILY! Not just on lifting days. Eat on recovery days, eat on rest days. It keeps your appetite up.\n\n- EAT MORE LEFTOVERS. Make extra, save some in the fridge. Have food ready-to-go in there. (Meal Prep).\n\n- EAT MORE INTENTIONALLY, NOT ACCIDENTALLY. Treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.\n\n- EAT MORE OVER TIME. Don't just stack hundreds more calories on. Increase a little bit more every week.\n\n- EAT MORE THANKFULLY! Always remember surplus food is a luxury, and gaining lean mass is a privilege (:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**THERE YOU GO! 20 TIPS How to Eat MORE. You just fucking eat more like you're being paid to do it.**",

            "I mean at this point just pin this so the sub doesn't get the same question 10 times a day.",
            "This is an excellent post. No preaching or long story. Direct to the point and many useful practical tips. Even implementing just handful will yield good results. I'm gonna reference this post in future \"how do I eat more\" posts. \n\n>EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. Basically, use all available hours to eat. Fuck intermittent fasting during gaining.\n\nJust to note here. Be mindful of involuntary IF. In other words, waking up at 8 and having no calories, sometimes maybe a black coffee or a couple of hundred calories till 12. You are not trying to fast, you just procrastinate on the eating. I think we've all been there. Suddenly you're pushing 75% of your calories on the remaining 25% of your day and on a consistent basis becomes a dragging task. That's why a lot of guys feel miserable. You want to be eating as soon as you possibly can (I do 1 hour after waking I'm getting in at least 600 calories) and you want to be on pace. The constant eating will still be annoying but no single meal will feel like an insurmountable task.",
            "The two things that really flipped the switch for me when I was first starting was eating a solid breakfast and eating at bedtime.  I had always been a cup of coffee and granola bar as I walked out the door kinda guy, but getting in a good solid meal to start the day actually seemed to make me *more* hungry later.  Insert bro science about kick starting your metabolism here.  I also started eating a big bowl of cottage cheese or greek yogurt right before bed every night because why not.  After 10 years of that I can\u2019t even sleep without a full stomach anymore.",
            "OP's list is basically all you need. For anyone interested, this is the order with which I did those things: \n\n+ EAT MORE FOOD. I did this a little at a time.\n\n+ EAT MORE FATS. I did this at the same time, and switched all my meats to the higher fat versions. Medium ground beef, chicken thighs, skin on chicken etc. \n\n+ EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. I stopped intermittent fasting after topping out at 130 lb.   \n\n+ EAT MORE PREDICTABLY. Eating consistently, regardless of hunger was a big help. \n\n+ EAT MORE OFTEN. Doing the above led to this one. \n\n+ EAT MORE CARBS. Doing all the above eventually maxed me out though, and carbs were the easiest way to add in more calories. \n\n+ EAT MORE FRUIT/VEGETABLES. I needed snacks that weren't filling. Enter fruit, also PB&Js. \n\n+ EAT MORE FLAVORS. I try my best to only cook delicious things. If I need something quick because it's too late, then it's my standard stir fry. \n\n+ EAT MORE QUICKLY/SLOWLY. Also, keep eating, however slow until all the food at your meal is finished. \n\n+ EAT MORE WATER. I found this happens naturally. As you eat more, you get more thirsty. \n\n+ EAT MORE VOLUME. I admittedly do not do this as written in the post. I am still least hungry and my stomach is wack first thing in the morning. I start with a shake, then the volume progressively increases throughout the day.",
            ">EAT MORE MUSH. Chewed-food takes too long. Ground beef > chicken. Rice or mashed potatoes > bread.\n\nThis is one thing I can tell helped me a lot.\n\nI prefer scrambled eggs, but boiled are much quicker to eat when you are eating 4+ at a time. In 2 minutes you are done eating them all and can still chug so much more cals.\n\nI realized that taking too long to eat kills your hunger. In my experience, hunger doesn't depend just on how empty your stomach is: after you begin eating, you have a time window before you begin feeling full. Eating quicker lets you eat more.",
            "And add...\n\nPLAN YOUR EATING: treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.",
            "Amazing post :) can I eat it?",
            "Something I do that's helpful is drink a protein shake as I'm lying in bed. You know that time where you lying bed, watching a TV show, or dicking around on your phone before bed? Yeah, drink an extra protein shake then for easy extra calories.",
            "My favorite tip? Put whatever you are eating in a damn burrito. The tortilla shell gets you a really easy 200 cal with a little but of fat, protein and carbs. Too damn easy",
            "but being hungry makes me anxious and when Im anxious I cant eat \n\nman I think I just maybe have an unhealthy relationship with food"

At night I would have a large glass of regular or chocolate milk with 3-6 walmart bakery powdered donuts.\n\nAlso probably like 5-15 budlights/ screwdrivers a week.\n\nOnly supplements I use are creatine, and caffeinated preworkout.
