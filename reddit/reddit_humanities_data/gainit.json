        "content": "People hate this answer. But it's the only answer. Maybe you don't understand the answer?\n\nInstead of asking \"How do I eat more?\", let's ask *\"Eat More WHAT?\"*\n\nSo in no particular order of importance:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n- EAT MORE FOOD. Obvious Goal here. More calories than you burn.\n\n- EAT MORE OFTEN. Now you eat 4-5 meals per day instead of 3 or 2. Stop eating snacks; eat big meals.\n\n- EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. Basically, use all available hours to eat. Fuck intermittent fasting during gaining.\n\n- EAT MORE FATS. Are you avoiding fats trying to not get fat? Fat is fuel & energy. Add oils & fats to meals.\n\n- EAT MORE CARBS. Afraid of \"insulin-stimulated fat storage?!?\" Carbs are easy. Pancakes, Waffles, Pasta.\n\n- EAT MORE FRUIT/VEGETABLES. Stick with citrus fruits & berries for acidity. Some green stuff every day.\n\n- EAT MORE MUSH. Chewed-food takes too long. Ground beef > chicken. Rice or mashed potatoes > bread.\n\n- EAT MORE FLAVORS. Hyper-palatable foods whet your appetite. Use more salt, more garlic and flavor sauces.\n\n- EAT MORE VOLUME. Don't start with a shake; eat a large meal, *then* chase it with a shake. Stretch the stomach.\n\n- EAT MORE PREDICTABLY. Don't wait for hunger. Set 4 consistent meal-times: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm etc.\n\n- EAT MORE QUICKLY/SLOWLY. Chow down with purpose. Eat vigorously. When full, slow down & keep nibbling.\n\n- EAT MORE WATER. Push water in-between meal times. 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm etc. Drink 16-20 ounces water.\n\n- EAT MORE FAMILIAR FOODS. Eat more of what you already eat, more of your favorite and easiest foods.\n\n- EAT MORE SIMPLY. Just track calories and get sufficient protein. Don't obsess about macro ratios/percentages.\n\n- EAT MORE CONSISTENTLY. Some days you don't feel like lifting but do anyways. Hit your food target anyway.\n\n- EAT MORE, DAILY! Not just on lifting days. Eat on recovery days, eat on rest days. It keeps your appetite up.\n\n- EAT MORE LEFTOVERS. Make extra, save some in the fridge. Have food ready-to-go in there. (Meal Prep).\n\n- EAT MORE INTENTIONALLY, NOT ACCIDENTALLY. Treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.\n\n- EAT MORE OVER TIME. Don't just stack hundreds more calories on. Increase a little bit more every week.\n\n- EAT MORE THANKFULLY! Always remember surplus food is a luxury, and gaining lean mass is a privilege (:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**THERE YOU GO! 20 TIPS How to Eat MORE. You just fucking eat more like you're being paid to do it.**",

            "I mean at this point just pin this so the sub doesn't get the same question 10 times a day.",
            "The two things that really flipped the switch for me when I was first starting was eating a solid breakfast and eating at bedtime.  I had always been a cup of coffee and granola bar as I walked out the door kinda guy, but getting in a good solid meal to start the day actually seemed to make me *more* hungry later.  Insert bro science about kick starting your metabolism here.  I also started eating a big bowl of cottage cheese or greek yogurt right before bed every night because why not.  After 10 years of that I can\u2019t even sleep without a full stomach anymore.",
            "And add...\n\nPLAN YOUR EATING: treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.",
            "Amazing post :) can I eat it?",
            "Something I do that's helpful is drink a protein shake as I'm lying in bed. You know that time where you lying bed, watching a TV show, or dicking around on your phone before bed? Yeah, drink an extra protein shake then for easy extra calories.",
            "My favorite tip? Put whatever you are eating in a damn burrito. The tortilla shell gets you a really easy 200 cal with a little but of fat, protein and carbs. Too damn easy",
            "but being hungry makes me anxious and when Im anxious I cant eat \n\nman I think I just maybe have an unhealthy relationship with food",
            "Its also much easier to drink your carbs than to eat, a good shake in the morning can easily fill  like 800-1000 calories",
            "Yes. Def gotta eat more water",
            "Where the fuck do you motherfuckers find the time to eat so much??!?! Honestly this is the single biggest obstacle for me, I can handle the workouts but I simply cannot eat as much."

From October 2023 I went from 140lbs to hitting 180lbs last month, idk what happened I guess I got hungry lol. Kinda burnt myself out because I was lifting 6 days a week and pigging out for the past 6/7 months so I\u2019m just maintaining for the summer. I\u2019m gonna try to hit 200lbs before next summer.\n\nMy bulk was dirty asl. Every day this is what I ate: \n\n2 sausage,egg, and cheese McMuffins and McDonald\u2019s hashbrowns for breakfast.\n\nChicken patty sandwich w/ mayo and a pb&j for lunch. \n\nSubway footlong steak and cheese w/ spinach, mayo, oil and vinegar for dinner 4 days a week or a large dominos pizza for dinner 3 days a week.\n\n1 scoop of Optimum nutrition vanilla mass gainer w/ banana, a serving of peanut butter, and greek honey yogurt after my workouts. \n\nFor snacks I would have a package of strawberry poptarts and a banana at work. At night I would have a large glass of regular or chocolate milk with 3-6 walmart bakery powdered donuts.\n\nAlso probably like 5-15 budlights/ screwdrivers a week.\n\nOnly supplements I use are creatine, and caffeinated preworkout. I also take ~1 hour nap before most workouts, napping is the best preworkout. \n\nKinda taking it easy rn, I was eating 4200-4500 calories, now maintaining at 3800. Im also only going to the gym like 2/3 days a week rn, Im just tryna enjoy my summer lol.\n\np.s. I HATE EATING\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\n\n",
