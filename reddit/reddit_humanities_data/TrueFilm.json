Was this something Ledger ever talked about? Or is it just an unsettling coincidence?",

Angus tells him that it was cruel he was left with only one mitten so he feels the loss that much more. We then see the Mormon kid throw the remaining mitten and it floats down the stream. I suppose this is meant to represent how the holdover kids as well as both Paul and Mary are alone, alienated, or dealing with loss? But why would the Mormon kid go and throw his other mitten too? Any ideas on this?\n\nThe other is Paul Hunham\u2019s lazy eye. It\u2019s a great detail for characterization but I do wonder if there is deeper meaning to the whole \u201cthis is the eye that you look at\u201d thing.

It\u2019s the other way around, obviously, because he reminds her of the mentally ill man she married."

Even by postmodern filmic standards, he is weird. His stuff has blobs of colour, shapes, weird footage, and hardly any characters or plot.\n\n  \nWhat do you think of him?\n\n  \nIt's not hard to see why he isn't popular. I mean, even for an experimental director. There is something fascinating about his works though. The weirdness of them, the visual nature, and the way he probably isn't human. How did these works even get releases? It's surprising that Lynch's early works got released, and The Holy Mountain by Jodorosky (probably) took decades to come out. But how did Brakhage get his films out, and what kind of people like, or even, understand them? How do you feel about them? Do you have a favourite, and if so, why? Do you care about them?",

            "I'm not sure narrative, feature filmmakers like Lynch or Jodorowsky are the best comparisons. As experimental as their films might get, they still involve scripts and actors and sets; Brakhage once made a film not by using a camera but by pressing insect wings, flower petals and other objects directly onto the film itself. \n\nI would argue that much better comparisons for Brakhage would be other experimental animators like Norman McLaren, Oskar Fischinger or Caroline Leaf. Or other avant-garde filmmakers on the border between cinema and museum video art, like Michael Snow or Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid.\n\nAs for Brakhage himself, I'm a fan, especially of *The Dante Quartet*, which strikes me as one of the great animated films. He is one of the very, very few filmmakers who could be accurately described as creating new possibilities for the medium.",
            "Brakhage was an experimental filmmaker not in the sense that he made stuff that was \u201cweird\u201d but in that he was literally *experimenting* without necessarily knowing what the final result would look like. He would do things like paint or attach other materials directly onto a strip of film without ever using a camera and run it through a projector. A lot of his work was created with an element of randomness, and the titles were only assigned afterwards based on what they made him think of, for example [stellar](https://youtu.be/L8r9t135_xY?si=DLV0u8gbN5oxmjJ4) reminded him of satellite photos of space and the [Persian](https://youtu.be/n4Ux04WI6nc?si=g-lGNiViOjIWX2DF) series reminded him of the style of Persian miniatures. A lot of his work is an exploration of form with any explanation being secondary. He spent most of his life more in the art world and academia rather than anything close to a conventional film path. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to compare him to narrative filmmakers. \u201cHow does Brakhage compare to Hollis Frampton or Michael Snow\u201d might be a better question.",
            "He was an experimental filmmaker so you can't compare him to narrative filmmakers. You have to view his work with a different lens. His work and technique has actually been very influential to narrative directors, other artists, and even musicians. Anytime we see scratched celluloid or painted film frames we should be thinking of Brakhage. I remember seeing The Tree of Life and was happy to see sequences that were probably influenced by Brakhage.",
            "Brakhage is probably the most popular avant-garde filmmaker of all-time, so where are you getting the idea that people don\u2019t like his work? No avant-garde artist has ever had mass appeal.",
            "Imo the only thing that he has in common with the others you listed is that he used a camera (but not always). I watch something like Dog Star Man and it\u2019s about as impressionistic, abstract and avant garde as film can come. Everyone is going to interpret it completely differently; while one shot might remind someone of their mother\u2019s womb it might cause another to have visions of a nuclear wasteland. Whereas there is an objective way to understand parts (or the majority) of something like Mulholland drive or el topo. I love his work but it\u2019s not about narrative. I don\u2019t think he needed much of a budget to create his art so that\u2019s probably how he built up a fan base over time but I\u2019m not an expert.",
            "I would recommend P. Adams Sitney's Visionary Film, which is a fantastic, readable overview of American experimental film. It has a chapter on Brakhage which will explain him in much more context and prep you for watching Dog Star Man, if you choose to go that route.",
            "As other comments have made clear, it may be moot to compare an experimental filmmaker with narrative filmmakers. It'd better be to compare his work with that of his contemporaries or modern filmmakers who work in a similar vein. Also, who is Jamil Jarares? I cannot find anything online when I look up his name. Is this a pseudonym for someone else?",
            "Really insightful comment, you\u2019ve given me some names to explore. thankyou!",
            "But Lynch and Jodorosky have both released works that were experimental and narrative works. Brakhage really is, you know, very strange.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dpjytg/composing_the_anatomy_of_a_fall/",
        "content": "I can't post my entire write-up of Anatomy of a Fall because this sub doesn't allow images in posts, which is confounding in a sub discussing cinema, so I'm going to post an excerpt from it and a link to [the full theory posted on my profile page](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmDeadYetILive/comments/1dpirca/composing_the_anatomy_of_a_fall/) (please read the full theory because this excerpt is a very small part of my analysis). In the theory I explain how the visuals allude to Samuel not committing suicide (that may seem obvious to some of you but a lot of viewers think he killed himself), detail the timing of the opening sequences leading to the discovery of Samuel's body, discuss the music and literature used in the film, how Sandra subtly influences Daniel, Snoop's presence on screen as another layer of the story, and... show possible evidence of MURDER! I'm going to limit this excerpt to the composition aspect.\n\nI know *Anatomy of a Fall* isn\u2019t really about whether she did it or not; it\u2019s primarily about the narratives Sandra and Daniel are forced to construct when facing the absurdity of the legal system, the sexism and biphobia she\u2019s up against, the bloodlust of a public eager to demonize people they don\u2019t know except through sensational press coverage, and the frailty and impressionability of human memory. However, the film is not only about the narratives we are forced to construct in order to vindicate ourselves publicly and in a court of law, but how we absolve ourselves of guilt and responsibility every day of our lives. It\u2019s about the stories we convince ourselves of and we subtly influence others to believe, about who we are, what we\u2019ve done, and what role we play in each other\u2019s misery and misfortune, whether intentional or not. And, it\u2019s a great *possible* murder mystery, one of the best in years. Who doesn\u2019t want to figure out how Samuel died?\n\nOne of the things I love most about this film is how it\u2019s also telling a story visually and through sound, that at times supports the dialogue and action on screen and at other times is in conflict with it. How do the visual puzzle pieces fit together to tell another layer of the story? On the surface, the film asks us to consider the question of Sandra\u2019s innocence or guilt, but the deeper question asked of viewers is \u201cwhat do your assumptions about what happened, based on what I\u2019m showing you, say about *you*?\u201d We are being asked to self-reflect from the beginning of the film. The first shot during Samuel\u2019s autopsy is a doctor\u2019s hand grabbing hold of an examination light, which he points directly into the camera. Perhaps we should examine ourselves before we make our judgements.\n\nDuring the police investigation at the house, we see a photo of Samuel on a bookshelf, surrounded by some interesting titles.\n\nHis photo sits atop a book by Jos\u00e9 Cabanis, the title upside down and illegible from any angle. Jos\u00e9 Cabanis was a French novelist, essayist, historian and magistrate. This is a likely part of Samuel and Sandra\u2019s literary collection as she is a writer and he lectured at the nearby university and had dreams of being a novelist. The two other titles we can make out are *L'\u00e9t\u00e9 meurt jeune* (*Summer Dies Young*) by Mirko Sabatino, and *N\u00e9s deux fois* (*Twice Born*) by Giuseppe Pontiggia.\n\nThe *L'\u00e9t\u00e9 meurt jeune* title perhaps speaks to the death of Daniel\u2019s childhood innocence. *N\u00e9s deux fois* is about a father with a disabled son, who blames himself for his son\u2019s impairment, thinking he caused it by cheating on his wife while she was pregnant. He also burdens his wife with all the childcare. Here we have obvious parallels with the dynamics between Samuel and Sandra regarding Daniel\u2019s blindness. Sandra initially blamed Samuel for not being where he was supposed to be when Daniel had his accident. Samuel felt immense guilt over this and took on the majority of Daniel\u2019s care.\n\nThere is a scene in the book where the parents are intent on getting a photograph of their son on the beach, so the father positions him to take a perfect picture but the boy\u2019s body won\u2019t stay put, he keeps falling. Over and over and over again, he forces him back into position only for the boy to collapse. We can draw a parallel with how Daniel is trying to construct a particular story of what he heard and what he thinks happened, eventually creating the perfect picture that will exonerate his mother. He falters just like the boy on the beach keeps collapsing, ruining the story the father wants the picture to tell about his family. I also think Sandra is subtly influencing Daniel through the film, perhaps not even aware that she is doing so, \u201cpositioning\u201d him to think of what happened in a way that benefits her.\n\nThere is also a line in the book: *\u201cYou must be as I want you, because only in this way can I have a relationship with you\u201d* which pretty much sums up the conflict at the heart of Samuel and Sandra\u2019s relationship. Sandra sees Samuel\u2019s desire to have more time for himself as a non-issue, oblivious to the fact that him having more time depends on her taking on more responsibility, being reciprocal. \u201cTwice Born\u201d may also refer to the story of Samuel that is born through Sandra and Daniel in court, and the birth of Daniel from child to man of the house. Note in the final scene between Daniel and Sandra, it is he who cradles and comforts her, a role reversal.\n\nBecause it\u2019s the father in *N\u00e9s deux fois* who hands off childcare and keeps trying to take the perfect picture, the parallel may not seem apparent at first, but consider that in *Anatomy of a Fall*, Sandra is in the role we historically associate with men, and Samuel is playing the role typically taken by women. How does that affect *our* perception of the relationship? If we listened to their recording with the roles reversed, with a man cheating on his wife, burdening her with the great majority of childcare (regardless that she initially wanted to, (s)he is now asking for help), belittling her for asking for more time for herself, then *hitting her*, we\u2019d all say he was horribly abusive at least in that moment.\n\nThe reaction to *her* doing this is fascinating.\n\nI've read so many people saying Samuel was at fault, he's abusive and manipulative and resents her for being a strong, successful woman. She *is* a strong, successful woman and he *is* envious of her success, but she's also self-absorbed and dismissive of him. He is not blameless because even if his physical violence is only against himself or the house it creates a tense environment; she is right that he uses her selfishness and his fear of failure to justify never trying or carving out his own space, and she did move her entire life for him at the expense of what she wanted. In my opinion, it\u2019s not really about who is right or wrong but instead about the expectations we have of each other and why so often familial responsibilities are unfairly divided, whether it\u2019s the man or the woman.\n\nBut when she says to him *\u201cI don\u2019t believe in reciprocity in relationships\u201d* what was your reaction to that? I thought wtf? In what world does an intimate or any kind of long-term partnership not involve reciprocity? To me, it sounded borderline sociopathic. She may have only been saying it because she was being stubborn in that moment, but again, imagine a man saying this to a woman who he has cheated on numerous times, is the primary caregiver to their child, and who is complaining she has no time to pursue her own ambitions. Does it hit differently? Ideally it would have the exact same effect no matter who is saying it, but I don\u2019t think it does for many viewers.\n\nThis role reversal is another way in which the film asks us to examine our own biases and the stories we tell each other about who we are and the measure of our impact on those closest to us.\n\nMost of the film is about constructing a story about and around this impact. Through the film Daniel is learning to play a complex piano piece called *Asturias (Leyenda)* by Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, this is symbolic of him learning how to tell a story, in effect he\u2019s \u201clearning the composition,\u201d which he struggles with through most of the film. The first time we see Daniel at the piano, the camera slowly zooms forward on a picture of Samuel staring back at us.\n\n\u201c*Leyenda\u201d means* legend, another word for story. *Asturia (Leyenda)* was originally published by Alb\u00e9niz in 1892 as *Prelude*, and was posthumously named *Asturia* (*Leyenda)* by a German publishing company. It was also posthumously included in the 1911 \"complete version\" of the *Suite espa\u00f1ola*, although Alb\u00e9niz never intended the piece for this suite. In fact, the assigning of the new name may have been a mistake due to the fact that Alb\u00e9niz actually wrote a different piece called *Asturias* which was lost. Described online \u201cAs part of *Suite espa\u00f1ola*, *Asturia (Leyenda)* does not reflect the geographical region to which the suite refers. *Asturias (Leyenda)*\u2019s Andalusian Flamenco rhythms have little to do with the Atlantic region of Asturias.\" This speaks to the idea that Daniel\u2019s current \u201ccomposition\u201d is misplaced within the story Sandra needs to tell in court.\n\nAround 35 minutes into the film his mother joins him at the piano and guides him to play something else. The film\u2019s soundtrack lists this piece as Chopin\u2019s *Prelude in E Minor Op. 28 No. 4.* Sandra wants Daniel to tell a different story, play a different song with her. Like the stories they\u2019re constructing about Samuel\u2019s death, currently the song they\u2019re trying to play together sounds like two different compositions, not in sync, disharmonious. Daniel becomes frustrated and leaves the piano.\n\nThe description of this piece reads \u201c*The piece is only a page long and uses a descending melody line. The melody starts with the dominant B and works its way to the tonic E, but halfway through the piece the descending line is interrupted and the melody starts over again. Only in the last bars does the melody dissolve in the tonic and go through a chord progression to the soothing and satisfying.*\u201d This sounds a lot like the trajectory of how Sandra and Daniel compose their stories and in the end unify.\n\nAt 2:08 Daniel plays *Variations sur un Pr\u00e9lude*, making the piece his own as he eventually puts together the final story he tells in court.\n\n*Prelude* appears again in the film around 2 hours and 16 minutes. It\u2019s quite brilliant, we can hear the clicking of a metronome as the notes are slowly and carefully played by an offscreen Daniel, over the visual of a reporter speaking on T.V. as a commotion from inside the courthouse moves outside. We don\u2019t hear what the reporter is saying, we hear the metronome, the piano, Snoop drinking his water and then his heels clicking across the floor, the same sound that began the film. It then cuts to Daniel happily watching/listening to his mother on T.V. as she speaks to reporters about her victory in court. This conjunction of sound in the house with image outside the courtroom suggests Sandra and Daniel\u2019s story is being \u201clapped up\u201d as the court and the public move to their side. Daniel played his part of their duet perfectly.\n\nThe Chopin piece plays for a third and last time at the very end of the film as the credits begin, perfect this time and also non-diegetic, as Sandra cuddles with Snoop. Even if she did accidentally or intentionally push his father, or was merely witness to the emotional decline that led him there, Daniel needs his mother. So while Sandra\u2019s story removes her from Samuel\u2019s vicinity at the time of his death (which may or may not be true), thus absolving her of any responsibility, Daniel\u2019s story cements for the court and public the reason for Samuel\u2019s alienation and solitary action. Now the music is harmonious, not one missed note, but it also speaks to the pervading grief that is now part of their family\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cHans von B\u00fclow called the prelude \"suffocation\", due to its sense of despair. In fact, Chopin's last dynamic marking in the piece is *smorzando*, which means \"dying away\". It was also referred to as *\"Quelles larmes au fond du clo\u00eetre humide?\"* (*\"What tears \\[are shed\\] from the depths of the damp monastery?\"*)\u201d\n\n(Read full analysis with images [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmDeadYetILive/comments/1dpirca/composing_the_anatomy_of_a_fall/)).\n\nEdit to add - Please follow the link and read the piece in full, people are responding without having read it in full and arguing points I haven't made.

            "I appreciate the rigor of this post but i think you yourself fell for the misogynistic red herrings in the subtext of the film (not saying you are a misogynist). \n\nCase in point is in your discussion or framing, its interesting how you havent at all noticed all the clear art direction choices made around the house that shows that Samuel was actually kicking holes in the drywall (by the kids room) and completely lagging ass in putting in insulation (with a steel studded roof like the one in the chalet this is a very simple process that shouldnt be taking endless days without progress and needing a hypermasculine soundtrack of PIMP). \n\nMe and the buddy i watched this with (both femmes) are in the building trades and we later reflected how both of us were really fixated on the obvious tells that this dude was just dithering because of how emotionally dysregulated he was and then trying to make it seem like the hard man work was oh-so-hard for him on top of his childcare and whatever he was saying his creative process was. \n\nIt seems more like the evidence youve perceptively traced, esp when coupled with the evidence of both physical destruction (serving no functional purpose and itself stalling the needed work on the chalet) and proof of Sam simply not doing the work (vis a vis the bare roof bays he somehow managed to not just slide the bats of insulation into over many weeks/months), actually augments the conclusion that he in fact did commit suicide. And that the inclusion of books (both hers previously published, his whatever it was gonna be before he self-murdered, as well as the ones on the shelves) merely serve to reinforce the idea that there was a prevailing mental environment of narratives (written and thought) that could serve to  reinforce a romantic story that places him in the center as a protagonist/victim, whether because thats in the subtext of the books you\u2019re pointing out or because it would be a salacious true crime tidbit for the bloodthirsty public if so. \n\nAlso as someone who has had an experience in the past with suicidal ideation stemming from a brutal rejection/betrayal from what was thought of as a life-long partner, i spoke with some other people with similar experiences and we felt that the scene where the prosecutor is saying \u201cthis man is screaming about justice; is that the last thing a suicidal person would say? I think not\u201d was the point where we were like \u201cum, no actually, a thwarted appeal to justice is DEFINITELY something that could be the final straw to send someone struggling over the edge.\u201d As in the notion that in Samuel\u2019s mind, this is all just some act of feminine calculated cunning and Samuel is like \u201chey, time out, stop gaslighting me that im having emotional problems, can you just \u2018act right\u2019 (aka affirm my reality and completely change your pattern of behavior i find to be personally harmful and without merit).\u201d\n\nFrom an evidentiary standpoint, there are multiple ways he could have jumped from the window or even slipped, but for her to have killed him required an almost john wick-like command of biomechanics to strike him and push him at the perfect time and angle. This reinforces the subtext of the fear and loathing of her not just as a powerful and unpredictable woman, but a *German* woman, with all the cultural stigma (esp french, post ww2; etc) that can be attributed to a person with german ancestry when foul play or violence is a possibility. I mean, the film that practically spells out the prejudicial notion that \u201coh the French people are just expressive and emotional, but the Germans are sneaky and evil and manichean.\u201d\n\nFinally, it seems like you\u2019re also missing the point that this is a French film and that the French film industry is notoriously misogynistic and has barely even begun to have its me too moment, because the cultural baggage of misogyny in France is so strong that you still have repeated in mainstream media and pop culture in france that the 50, 60, 70 year-old male rapist actors/directors/producers were just these passionate lovers doing what frenchmen do best and in fact the teenagers that they\u2019re grooming and abusing, well they are actually just willing harlots who chose to get involved, knowing that it could advance their careers.\n\nNotice the symmetry here with a movie about an emotionally immature man who creates an abusive atmosphere, but then is centered as the victim protagonist when he is examined by a court of law within an infamous film industry where emotionally mature men who create abusive atmospheres are centered as the victim protagonist in the court of public opinion.\n\nEdit: spelling, clarity",

            "I was very surprised to how people reacted to the movie. To me, the conclusion was fairly obvious but basically no one shared it:\n\nShe killed him, didn't mean to (non-premeditated murder), the kid knows her mother killed his dad but convinces himself of a lie in order to not have to live the shitty shitty shitty life that truth would bring him. He chooses a murderous mom over the truth.\n\nFor me, the center of the movie was the kid learning to deal with the lying world of adults where truth doesn't matter and everyone is just making up stories. He sees that the truth (mom killed dad) will land him in a life of suffering, and chooses a lie instead. I think he does this knowingly, to the extent that a kid can reason through these things.\n\nI agree that the guy definitely didn't jump out of the window, that's just a silly way to commit suicide, it never held water for a second in my viewing of the movie.\n\nI thought that *the movie was gaslighting me* into not believing the obvious: no one commits suicide by jumping less than 10 meters into snow. What if you don't die and your kid comes back home to find you a wailing, barely alive mess of sinew, muscle and bone? Nah, never bought it for a second.\n\nFor me, it was especially interesting to make the movie about the kid in my mind, how he realizes that he's actually and agent in all this, and that in the end the choice will be his. The adults in the movie are all fairly pathetic beings. \n\nThe kid is amazing and takes responsibility for life and death on his hands and makes the pragmatic choice.",
            "Just wanted to say that this is an excellent comment. Really nice breakdown of how the film touches on misogyny, and how it's reflected in audience response.",
            "> From an evidentiary standpoint, there are multiple ways he could have jumped from the window or even slipped, but for her to have killed him required an almost john wick-like command of biomechanics to strike him and push him at the perfect time and angle.\n\nWhat? Wait. This implies she *tried* to murder him. She could've just wanted to hit him or hurt him and the death was unintended. I don't think OP was arguing for premeditated murder, more like violent manslaughter.",
            "*Case in point is in your discussion or framing, its interesting how you havent at all noticed all the clear art direction choices made around the house that shows that Samuel was actually kicking holes in the drywall (by the kids room)*\n\nI didn't miss it, I mention his violence against himself and the house and that he played a role in her torment, too. Maybe you didn't read to the end of the piece?\n\nIt's difficult to \"appreciate the rigor of \\[my\\] post\" when you haven't actually read it.\n\n*Me and the buddy i watched this with (both femmes) are in the building trades and we later reflected how both of us were really fixated on the obvious tells that this dude was just dithering because of how emotionally dysregulated he was and then trying to make it seem like the hard man work was oh-so-hard for him on top of his childcare and whatever he was saying his creative process was.*\n\nI'm getting the impression you skimmed through what I wrote because I said he was using her as an excuse to not try or carve out his own space.\n\n*Also as someone who has had an experience in the past with suicidal ideation stemming from a brutal rejection/betrayal from what was thought of as a life-long partner,*\n\nWelcome to the club.\n\n*i spoke with some other people with similar experiences and we felt that the scene where the prosecutor is saying \u201cthis man is screaming about justice; is that the last thing a suicidal person would say? I think not\u201d was the point where we were like \u201cum, no actually, a thwarted appeal to justice is DEFINITELY something that could be the final straw to send someone struggling over the edge.\u201d As in the notion that in Samuel\u2019s mind, this is all just some act of feminine calculated cunning and Samuel is like \u201chey, time out, stop gaslighting me that im having emotional problems, can you just \u2018act right\u2019 (aka affirm my reality and completely change your pattern of behavior i find to be personally harmful and without merit).\u201d*\n\nI mentioned that after Sandra's lawyer paints Samuel as suicidal and in despair, Sandra says to him \"That was not Samuel.\" Even in court, all odds stacked against her *and at the risk of the prosecutor hearing her,* she felt so strongly about how inaccurately Samuel was being portrayed that she was compelled to speak against it. Sandra objected to this portrayal of Samuel because it wasn't the full picture. I'm saying the \"suicide\" (note the quotation marks) Samuel suffered was his emotional decline and that Sandra played a part in that. Even the director/writer of the film says the central core of the film is about the idea of reciprocity. He is part of her torment, she is a part of his.\n\n*From an evidentiary standpoint, there are multiple ways he could have jumped from the window or even slipped, but for her to have killed him required an almost john wick-like command of biomechanics to strike him and push him at the perfect time and angle.*\n\nHere's an idea. I spent probably 30 hours in total writing this piece, maybe you could take 20 minutes to read it in full before responding? When I say MURDER in the first paragraph, it's because I'm hoping to get people to fully engage with the analysis. **My conclusion is that there is no murder**, and that she is telling the truth. If you had read what I wrote, you'd know that.\n\n*This reinforces the subtext of the fear and loathing of her not just as a powerful and unpredictable woman, but a German woman, with all the cultural stigma (esp french, post ww2; etc) that can be attributed to a person with german ancestry when foul play or violence is a possibility. I mean, the film that practically spells out the prejudicial notion that \u201coh the French people are just expressive and emotional, but the Germans are sneaky and evil and manichean.\u201d*\n\nI love how you claim I've fallen for misogynistic red herrings when you've cherry picked tiny parts of what I wrote and paint my entire perspective with them.\n\n*Finally, it seems like you\u2019re also missing the point that this is a French film and that the French film industry is notoriously misogynistic and has barely even begun to have its me too moment, because the cultural baggage of misogyny in France is so strong that you still have repeated in mainstream media and pop culture in france that the 50, 60, 70 year-old male rapist actors/directors/producers were just these passionate lovers doing what frenchmen do best and in fact the teenagers that they\u2019re grooming and abusing, well they are actually just willing harlots who chose to get involved, knowing that it could advance their careers.*\n\nIt's not relevant to the film, nor my analysis.
