Angus tells him that it was cruel he was left with only one mitten so he feels the loss that much more. We then see the Mormon kid throw the remaining mitten and it floats down the stream. I suppose this is meant to represent how the holdover kids as well as both Paul and Mary are alone, alienated, or dealing with loss? But why would the Mormon kid go and throw his other mitten too? Any ideas on this?\n\nThe other is Paul Hunham\u2019s lazy eye. It\u2019s a great detail for characterization but I do wonder if there is deeper meaning to the whole \u201cthis is the eye that you look at\u201d thing.

Even by postmodern filmic standards, he is weird. His stuff has blobs of colour, shapes, weird footage, and hardly any characters or plot.\n\n  \nWhat do you think of him?\n\n  \nIt's not hard to see why he isn't popular. I mean, even for an experimental director. There is something fascinating about his works though. The weirdness of them, the visual nature, and the way he probably isn't human. How did these works even get releases? It's surprising that Lynch's early works got released, and The Holy Mountain by Jodorosky (probably) took decades to come out. But how did Brakhage get his films out, and what kind of people like, or even, understand them? How do you feel about them? Do you have a favourite, and if so, why? Do you care about them?",

            "He was an experimental filmmaker so you can't compare him to narrative filmmakers. You have to view his work with a different lens. His work and technique has actually been very influential to narrative directors, other artists, and even musicians. Anytime we see scratched celluloid or painted film frames we should be thinking of Brakhage. I remember seeing The Tree of Life and was happy to see sequences that were probably influenced by Brakhage.",
            "Brakhage is probably the most popular avant-garde filmmaker of all-time, so where are you getting the idea that people don\u2019t like his work? No avant-garde artist has ever had mass appeal.",
            "Imo the only thing that he has in common with the others you listed is that he used a camera (but not always). I watch something like Dog Star Man and it\u2019s about as impressionistic, abstract and avant garde as film can come. Everyone is going to interpret it completely differently; while one shot might remind someone of their mother\u2019s womb it might cause another to have visions of a nuclear wasteland. Whereas there is an objective way to understand parts (or the majority) of something like Mulholland drive or el topo. I love his work but it\u2019s not about narrative. I don\u2019t think he needed much of a budget to create his art so that\u2019s probably how he built up a fan base over time but I\u2019m not an expert.",
            "I would recommend P. Adams Sitney's Visionary Film, which is a fantastic, readable overview of American experimental film. It has a chapter on Brakhage which will explain him in much more context and prep you for watching Dog Star Man, if you choose to go that route.",
            "The more abstract his work is, the more i like it. Saw his film Ellipses \"(\u2026)\" at Film Forum years ago. It\u2019s one of those films where he used an optical printer to get wild colors with objects glued directly to the film. It was a stunning experience. (But i really love abstract art.) Those films are incredibly intense, as there\u2019s a completely new and mostly unrelated picture flying by 24 times every second. But absolutely unique in that it kind of puts you into a trance after a while. Have never had another film or art experience quite like it.",
            "As other comments have made clear, it may be moot to compare an experimental filmmaker with narrative filmmakers.

Personally Norman McLaren is my other favorite in that area; what he was doing with sound film in the 1940s (like \u2018Dots\u2019) sounds like contemporary experimental electronic music, totally crazy. Quite possibly the first synthesized music of all time (arguable). Have a box set of both artists works and treasure them. Their stuff can be hard to come by, as it\u2019s considered pretty niche.",

        "content": "I can't post my entire write-up of Anatomy of a Fall because this sub doesn't allow images in posts, which is confounding in a sub discussing cinema, so I'm going to post an excerpt from it and a link to [the full theory posted on my profile page](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmDeadYetILive/comments/1dpirca/composing_the_anatomy_of_a_fall/) (please read the full theory because this excerpt is a very small part of my analysis). In the theory I explain how the visuals allude to Samuel not committing suicide (that may seem obvious to some of you but a lot of viewers think he killed himself), detail the timing of the opening sequences leading to the discovery of Samuel's body, discuss the music and literature used in the film, how Sandra subtly influences Daniel, Snoop's presence on screen as another layer of the story, and... show possible evidence of MURDER! I'm going to limit this excerpt to the composition aspect.\n\nI know *Anatomy of a Fall* isn\u2019t really about whether she did it or not; it\u2019s primarily about the narratives Sandra and Daniel are forced to construct when facing the absurdity of the legal system, the sexism and biphobia she\u2019s up against, the bloodlust of a public eager to demonize people they don\u2019t know except through sensational press coverage, and the frailty and impressionability of human memory. However, the film is not only about the narratives we are forced to construct in order to vindicate ourselves publicly and in a court of law, but how we absolve ourselves of guilt and responsibility every day of our lives. It\u2019s about the stories we convince ourselves of and we subtly influence others to believe, about who we are, what we\u2019ve done, and what role we play in each other\u2019s misery and misfortune, whether intentional or not. And, it\u2019s a great *possible* murder mystery, one of the best in years. Who doesn\u2019t want to figure out how Samuel died?\n\nOne of the things I love most about this film is how it\u2019s also telling a story visually and through sound, that at times supports the dialogue and action on screen and at other times is in conflict with it. How do the visual puzzle pieces fit together to tell another layer of the story? On the surface, the film asks us to consider the question of Sandra\u2019s innocence or guilt, but the deeper question asked of viewers is \u201cwhat do your assumptions about what happened, based on what I\u2019m showing you, say about *you*?\u201d We are being asked to self-reflect from the beginning of the film. The first shot during Samuel\u2019s autopsy is a doctor\u2019s hand grabbing hold of an examination light, which he points directly into the camera. Perhaps we should examine ourselves before we make our judgements.\n\nDuring the police investigation at the house, we see a photo of Samuel on a bookshelf, surrounded by some interesting titles.\n\nHis photo sits atop a book by Jos\u00e9 Cabanis, the title upside down and illegible from any angle. Jos\u00e9 Cabanis was a French novelist, essayist, historian and magistrate. This is a likely part of Samuel and Sandra\u2019s literary collection as she is a writer and he lectured at the nearby university and had dreams of being a novelist. The two other titles we can make out are *L'\u00e9t\u00e9 meurt jeune* (*Summer Dies Young*) by Mirko Sabatino, and *N\u00e9s deux fois* (*Twice Born*) by Giuseppe Pontiggia.\n\nThe *L'\u00e9t\u00e9 meurt jeune* title perhaps speaks to the death of Daniel\u2019s childhood innocence. *N\u00e9s deux fois* is about a father with a disabled son, who blames himself for his son\u2019s impairment, thinking he caused it by cheating on his wife while she was pregnant. He also burdens his wife with all the childcare. Here we have obvious parallels with the dynamics between Samuel and Sandra regarding Daniel\u2019s blindness. Sandra initially blamed Samuel for not being where he was supposed to be when Daniel had his accident. Samuel felt immense guilt over this and took on the majority of Daniel\u2019s care.\n\nThere is a scene in the book where the parents are intent on getting a photograph of their son on the beach, so the father positions him to take a perfect picture but the boy\u2019s body won\u2019t stay put, he keeps falling. Over and over and over again, he forces him back into position only for the boy to collapse. We can draw a parallel with how Daniel is trying to construct a particular story of what he heard and what he thinks happened, eventually creating the perfect picture that will exonerate his mother. He falters just like the boy on the beach keeps collapsing, ruining the story the father wants the picture to tell about his family. I also think Sandra is subtly influencing Daniel through the film, perhaps not even aware that she is doing so, \u201cpositioning\u201d him to think of what happened in a way that benefits her.\n\nThere is also a line in the book: *\u201cYou must be as I want you, because only in this way can I have a relationship with you\u201d* which pretty much sums up the conflict at the heart of Samuel and Sandra\u2019s relationship. Sandra sees Samuel\u2019s desire to have more time for himself as a non-issue, oblivious to the fact that him having more time depends on her taking on more responsibility, being reciprocal. \u201cTwice Born\u201d may also refer to the story of Samuel that is born through Sandra and Daniel in court, and the birth of Daniel from child to man of the house. Note in the final scene between Daniel and Sandra, it is he who cradles and comforts her, a role reversal.\n\nBecause it\u2019s the father in *N\u00e9s deux fois* who hands off childcare and keeps trying to take the perfect picture, the parallel may not seem apparent at first, but consider that in *Anatomy of a Fall*, Sandra is in the role we historically associate with men, and Samuel is playing the role typically taken by women. How does that affect *our* perception of the relationship? If we listened to their recording with the roles reversed, with a man cheating on his wife, burdening her with the great majority of childcare (regardless that she initially wanted to, (s)he is now asking for help), belittling her for asking for more time for herself, then *hitting her*, we\u2019d all say he was horribly abusive at least in that moment.\n\nThe reaction to *her* doing this is fascinating.\n\nI've read so many people saying Samuel was at fault, he's abusive and manipulative and resents her for being a strong, successful woman. She *is* a strong, successful woman and he *is* envious of her success, but she's also self-absorbed and dismissive of him. He is not blameless because even if his physical violence is only against himself or the house it creates a tense environment; she is right that he uses her selfishness and his fear of failure to justify never trying or carving out his own space, and she did move her entire life for him at the expense of what she wanted. In my opinion, it\u2019s not really about who is right or wrong but instead about the expectations we have of each other and why so often familial responsibilities are unfairly divided, whether it\u2019s the man or the woman.\n\nBut when she says to him *\u201cI don\u2019t believe in reciprocity in relationships\u201d* what was your reaction to that? I thought wtf? In what world does an intimate or any kind of long-term partnership not involve reciprocity? To me, it sounded borderline sociopathic. She may have only been saying it because she was being stubborn in that moment, but again, imagine a man saying this to a woman who he has cheated on numerous times, is the primary caregiver to their child, and who is complaining she has no time to pursue her own ambitions. Does it hit differently? Ideally it would have the exact same effect no matter who is saying it, but I don\u2019t think it does for many viewers.\n\nThis role reversal is another way in which the film asks us to examine our own biases and the stories we tell each other about who we are and the measure of our impact on those closest to us.\n\nMost of the film is about constructing a story about and around this impact. Through the film Daniel is learning to play a complex piano piece called *Asturias (Leyenda)* by Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, this is symbolic of him learning how to tell a story, in effect he\u2019s \u201clearning the composition,\u201d which he struggles with through most of the film. The first time we see Daniel at the piano, the camera slowly zooms forward on a picture of Samuel staring back at us.\n\n\u201c*Leyenda\u201d means* legend, another word for story. *Asturia (Leyenda)* was originally published by Alb\u00e9niz in 1892 as *Prelude*, and was posthumously named *Asturia* (*Leyenda)* by a German publishing company. It was also posthumously included in the 1911 \"complete version\" of the *Suite espa\u00f1ola*, although Alb\u00e9niz never intended the piece for this suite. In fact, the assigning of the new name may have been a mistake due to the fact that Alb\u00e9niz actually wrote a different piece called *Asturias* which was lost. Described online \u201cAs part of *Suite espa\u00f1ola*, *Asturia (Leyenda)* does not reflect the geographical region to which the suite refers. *Asturias (Leyenda)*\u2019s Andalusian Flamenco rhythms have little to do with the Atlantic region of Asturias.\" This speaks to the idea that Daniel\u2019s current \u201ccomposition\u201d is misplaced within the story Sandra needs to tell in court.\n\nAround 35 minutes into the film his mother joins him at the piano and guides him to play something else. The film\u2019s soundtrack lists this piece as Chopin\u2019s *Prelude in E Minor Op. 28 No. 4.* Sandra wants Daniel to tell a different story, play a different song with her. Like the stories they\u2019re constructing about Samuel\u2019s death, currently the song they\u2019re trying to play together sounds like two different compositions, not in sync, disharmonious. Daniel becomes frustrated and leaves the piano.\n\nThe description of this piece reads \u201c*The piece is only a page long and uses a descending melody line. The melody starts with the dominant B and works its way to the tonic E, but halfway through the piece the descending line is interrupted and the melody starts over again. Only in the last bars does the melody dissolve in the tonic and go through a chord progression to the soothing and satisfying.*\u201d This sounds a lot like the trajectory of how Sandra and Daniel compose their stories and in the end unify.\n\nAt 2:08 Daniel plays *Variations sur un Pr\u00e9lude*, making the piece his own as he eventually puts together the final story he tells in court.\n\n*Prelude* appears again in the film around 2 hours and 16 minutes. It\u2019s quite brilliant, we can hear the clicking of a metronome as the notes are slowly and carefully played by an offscreen Daniel, over the visual of a reporter speaking on T.V. as a commotion from inside the courthouse moves outside. We don\u2019t hear what the reporter is saying, we hear the metronome, the piano, Snoop drinking his water and then his heels clicking across the floor, the same sound that began the film. It then cuts to Daniel happily watching/listening to his mother on T.V. as she speaks to reporters about her victory in court. This conjunction of sound in the house with image outside the courtroom suggests Sandra and Daniel\u2019s story is being \u201clapped up\u201d as the court and the public move to their side. Daniel played his part of their duet perfectly.\n\nThe Chopin piece plays for a third and last time at the very end of the film as the credits begin, perfect this time and also non-diegetic, as Sandra cuddles with Snoop. Even if she did accidentally or intentionally push his father, or was merely witness to the emotional decline that led him there, Daniel needs his mother. So while Sandra\u2019s story removes her from Samuel\u2019s vicinity at the time of his death (which may or may not be true), thus absolving her of any responsibility, Daniel\u2019s story cements for the court and public the reason for Samuel\u2019s alienation and solitary action. Now the music is harmonious, not one missed note, but it also speaks to the pervading grief that is now part of their family\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cHans von B\u00fclow called the prelude \"suffocation\", due to its sense of despair. In fact, Chopin's last dynamic marking in the piece is *smorzando*, which means \"dying away\". It was also referred to as *\"Quelles larmes au fond du clo\u00eetre humide?\"* (*\"What tears \\[are shed\\] from the depths of the damp monastery?\"*)\u201d\n\n(Read full analysis with images [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmDeadYetILive/comments/1dpirca/composing_the_anatomy_of_a_fall/)).\n\nEdit to add - Please follow the link and read the piece in full, people are responding without having read it in full and arguing points I haven't made.
