            "I've seen this reported elsewhere, but during the Drukhari raid on the Mass Conveyor the Drukhari break off after half their ships are downed, flee to the edge of the map and then just flat out refuse to take their turn, meaning that the game is soft-locked and can't progress any further.",

        "content": "&#x200B;\n\nLord Captains!\n\nAs we continue our work on Rogue Trader, we would like to expand our attention towards the console version of the game. While we've already fixed a wide array of performance and stability issues in the recent major update, we feel that we could use more feedback and data from our console players in order to better prioritize our further efforts. \n\nPlease leave all your console-specific feedback and requests for technical support in this thread. When asking for help, please attach screenshots or video of your problem if it's possible.\n\nWe will be really grateful if you pop by \u2060\u2060consoles and share your thoughts with us! This will be really helpful for further development.\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**By Design:** \n\n* To prevent the party from running into traps when they are detected, change the Formation, placing the RT in the first row. This can be done in the menu using the small right button;\n* To prevent a character from running into traps during remote disarming, first separate one character and move him past the trap using the stick;\n* Ultimate abilities can be manually placed in the main action bar or used from the Momentum scale;\n\n**Known Issues/Workarounds:**\n\n* If you encounter a pause that cannot be removed, turn off autopause in the settings, and then make a quicksave-quickload (or load the save to this point);\n* If you encounter a stuck UI or freezing enemies, try making a quicksave - quickload;\n* It is now more convenient to select a system on the global map using the cursor rather than the stick. Controls will be redesigned in future patches;\n* If the save does not load from the main menu when you restart the game after a crash, try loading another save, and from it - the desired one;\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* Freezes on PS5 can be caused by some abilities, items, or the behavior of some units in the zone. If you encounter lags, please report it as a bug, so we will be able to investigate and fix it;\n* If the game crashes, you need to send a bug report from the main menu once you launch the game again next time - that way we\u2019ll receive the necessary log files;\n* In any case, please, send reports from inside the game. The more detailed the description will be, the faster we will be able to work out a solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjbwbcj6rwnc1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2461adf1993d158727fae328eb1a2a45b7c7c209",

Hearing \"I serve the ruinous powers\" or \"Make them bleed\" said in those mad voices a dozen times each turn can be wearing on one's sanity.",
            "I'm on PS5. Occasional FPS drops to steady single digits. Hard-crashes (learn to quick save after each fight). Quests left hanning on journal. Grand strategist area overlays remaining on screen after battles. Voidship torpedos not being able to be launched on a square where it should be OK to launch.\n\nGreat game overall even with all the bugs. Finished it after 110hrs. Bit too much for a family man and at the end I didn't care to plan all the level ups and gear too much. But the lore and world felt good until the end so enjoyed it for the most part.",
            "So the ice world at crossroad of 100 dreams is still bugged and I honestly don't feel like sitting around in act 2 was just wondering if you could tell me what this is supposed to be or do or at least promise that you're going to fix it in the next patch because I don't know if this is some good loot I'm missing out on or some cool content.",
            "I am suffering significant stuttering and lag out of nowhere in act 4 on PS5. It has rendered the game unplayable.

            "The crashing in this game is a nightmare. I've only owned it for a few days, but I've lost at least an hour or two of my time from crashing after long battles. I go to save after a long fight and sometimes it crashes when trying to save. Given how long most of these fights are, this is deflating. When in the thick of a fight trying to strategize every move, quicksaving is not something that comes to mind after each turn, so I hope the feedback isn't to simply \"save more\". I try and save whenever I think of it. I've also reinstalled the game fresh.\n\nI don't mean to sound spiteful towards Owlcat, but for anyone reading this, it's still not ready for purchase. Save yourself the headache. I was hesitant to buy given the ongoing commentary around instability and bugs, but some suggested the worst of it has been fixed so I took the plunge. Now i'm inclined to disagree; bugs are one thing, but regular crashing leading to loss of progress is still part of the worst of it, if you ask me.",
            "Was bugged during the palace attack. Think I left and when I went back there was no battle but my quest was to fend off the attack. Worthless game if you cannot even play through.  I have never beaten this game because of bugs. Fucking  ridiculous.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueTraderCRPG/comments/1dr7oqd/the_commissar_paradox/",
        "content": "I\u2019m playing my second run, first run on 1.2, and due to the changes with officers, I thought a Commissar would be fun.  I had an idea that he was indirectly buffed by the patch since his ability to grant an extra turn is now more valuable in an era of fewer extra turns, and unlike the Naval Officer\u2019s extra turn where you can only use heroics, this is a true extra turn that works immediately.\n\nBut I quickly realized a big problem with how this ability actually works.\n\nFor those that don\u2019t know, a Commissar can shoot an enemy with a single shot and an ally that kills the enemy gains an extra turn.  If the Commissar kills it, nothing happens.\n\nSo, the enemy has to be strong enough (or you are intentionally using a weak enough gun) where you don\u2019t kill it.  Without intentionally using a very weak gun, this is harder than you would think when you want to start equipping things like plasma pistols and start working into your buffs, or otherwise denying yourself buffs, which feels bad and suboptimal.\n\nBut the enemy also can\u2019t be the boss.  Why?  Because then the fight is over and the fact that you earned an extra turn is trivial.  Fights don\u2019t last very long, but killing the boss is last because you farm the fodder for momentum and spend your earnings on the boss.  That\u2019s the mechanic cycle of the game.\n\nSo playing as a Commissar is really awkward dance of hot potato hoping NOT to kill enemies and depriving your character of buffs just to have the chance to give out one extra turn.  It just doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d good.\n\nWhen I think of a Commissar, a very iconic 40K archetype from Gaunt to Yarrick to even Cain, the playstyle of the Commissar just seems bizarre and timid by comparison.\n\nAside from the paradox mentioned above, the other things about the Commissar in general is that I don\u2019t think its benefits really synergize nearly as well as a noble, guard officer, psyker (lol), or even navy officer for being an officer.   And considering your retinue consists of inquisitors, nobles, Astartes, a sororitas, and not conscripts, the thing about shooting one of them feels really stupid in context.  A summary execution is a punishment for cowardice, not a weird pin the tail on the donkey buffing system.  It ruins the immersion of being a Commissar or even just the relationships between the characters.  Why would I shoot Argenta?  It\u2019s just dumb.",

            "This has been commented on, multiple times, wish they fixed it, but meanwhile... The workaround I've done is to just use it on the \"mid-tier\" enemies, like Tier 3+, those are generally not the ones that die in the first shot, tho since you can be any archetype, it's difficult to test out.",
