It just doesn't react at all to allies using a Heroic Act (Psy rating stays at 0).\n\nI'm still new to the game system but that talent seems pretty significant for that type of pysker (And happens to have paused my current playthrough)\n\nThis is on PC",

Crashes can happen anywhere after extended playtime but some areas are more of a hotspot. Ship Bridge, Footfall, for example, the arena in CH3. And it progresses the further you get so I went from just having to save often in Footfall to not even able to submit a report in game since by Chapter 4 it\u2019s crash before the report even goes through.\n\nDon\u2019t wanna sound too dramatic but its about an inch away from \u201cliterally unplayable\u201d by now",

        "content": "&#x200B;\n\nLord Captains!\n\nAs we continue our work on Rogue Trader, we would like to expand our attention towards the console version of the game. While we've already fixed a wide array of performance and stability issues in the recent major update, we feel that we could use more feedback and data from our console players in order to better prioritize our further efforts. \n\nPlease leave all your console-specific feedback and requests for technical support in this thread. When asking for help, please attach screenshots or video of your problem if it's possible.\n\nWe will be really grateful if you pop by \u2060\u2060consoles and share your thoughts with us! This will be really helpful for further development.\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**By Design:** \n\n* To prevent the party from running into traps when they are detected, change the Formation, placing the RT in the first row. This can be done in the menu using the small right button;\n* To prevent a character from running into traps during remote disarming, first separate one character and move him past the trap using the stick;\n* Ultimate abilities can be manually placed in the main action bar or used from the Momentum scale;\n\n**Known Issues/Workarounds:**\n\n* If you encounter a pause that cannot be removed, turn off autopause in the settings, and then make a quicksave-quickload (or load the save to this point);\n* If you encounter a stuck UI or freezing enemies, try making a quicksave - quickload;\n* It is now more convenient to select a system on the global map using the cursor rather than the stick. Controls will be redesigned in future patches;\n* If the save does not load from the main menu when you restart the game after a crash, try loading another save, and from it - the desired one;\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* Freezes on PS5 can be caused by some abilities, items, or the behavior of some units in the zone. If you encounter lags, please report it as a bug, so we will be able to investigate and fix it;\n* If the game crashes, you need to send a bug report from the main menu once you launch the game again next time - that way we\u2019ll receive the necessary log files;\n* In any case, please, send reports from inside the game. The more detailed the description will be, the faster we will be able to work out a solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjbwbcj6rwnc1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2461adf1993d158727fae328eb1a2a45b7c7c209",

            "Hi, I just thought I'd swing by and make a quick comment for my fellow console players.\n\nOwlcat has effectively abandoned two other projects on consoles, leaving behind two games that are laggy, unoptimized, ugly, and chockful of bugs and errors. I understand they lost the ownership of Kingmaker, but since the release of Rogue Trader the thread for console feedback for WoTR was abandoned and unpinned from the subreddit. Our last update was in November of last year and we are still missing several patches that have been \"in the works\" for a while now. \n\nAll I wanted to say was that if you have bought the game, then it's possible that this is as good as the game will get. Console is secondary to Owlcat and I genuinely expect that the end product will not look too different from its current state.\n\n(I should also mention that you can see the state of console in the pathfinder kingmaker subreddit if you want an example. The subreddit encompasses both Kingmake and WoTR. I also want to say that the community manager likely has zero power over this whole situation. I don't expect them to answer to this or even have an answer. I hope no one will harass them as the point of this post is simply to inform buyers, I've personally already moved on from WoTR and will not be buying Rogue Trader after seeing its current state on console.)",
            "Please fix performance across the board. And I don't just mean the sub-60 framerates, but the load times, too.\n\nIf possible, see about adding a toggle for enemy chatter during combat. Hearing \"I serve the ruinous powers\" or \"Make them bleed\" said in those mad voices a dozen times each turn can be wearing on one's sanity.",
            "I'm on PS5. Occasional FPS drops to steady single digits. Hard-crashes (learn to quick save after each fight). Quests left hanning on journal. Grand strategist area overlays remaining on screen after battles. Voidship torpedos not being able to be launched on a square where it should be OK to launch.\n\nGreat game overall even with all the bugs. Finished it after 110hrs. Bit too much for a family man and at the end I didn't care to plan all the level ups and gear too much. But the lore and world felt good until the end so enjoyed it for the most part.",
            "So the ice world at crossroad of 100 dreams is still bugged and I honestly don't feel like sitting around in act 2 was just wondering if you could tell me what this is supposed to be or do or at least promise that you're going to fix it in the next patch because I don't know if this is some good loot I'm missing out on or some cool content.",
            "I\u2019m almost done with chapter three on ps5. There are two issues that stick out the most that have made me take long breaks from the game and considered dropping it for good:\n\n1. The loading times are insane and way too frequent. Especially when going from the sector map, to the bridge, or to system map. Or when getting a game over, loading an auto save that\u2019s outside the entrance to the area you want to visit, triggering another loading screen. The load times are so long and most of the time they\u2019re at 95%+.\n\n2. Game freezes briefly when aiming burst fire mode for most weapons. Every time I move the cursor a space the game freezes for a few seconds. Makes using burst fire really frustrating to the point I have phased it out of my builds\n\nOtherwise there are smalller bugs I\u2019ve encountered. Like companions randomly no longer following party leader even though the whole group is linked. Only way to fix is to reload the game or try\nTo transition areas. Randomly in combat, hit chance and life bars won\u2019t appear over enemies or the move command won\u2019t respond until I toggle the action bar on and off. But I can work around these sort of bugs.",
            "I am suffering significant stuttering and lag out of nowhere in act 4 on PS5. It has rendered the game unplayable. I will leave a bug report. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth it happened after a story element. No changes in gear or abilities. Game worked fine, finished a quest line, boom, bricked.",
            "Can we have an option to lock the camera to the character? Currently the camera seems to shift slightly ahead of the character when he moves, meaning that the character is rarely at the centre of the screen. It makes movement feel laggy and imprecise.\n\nAlso, the log on the right hand side will quite often stop updating itself. You have to open it with R1 to get it to actually catch up.\n\nThis is on PS5.",
            "Where coop?",
            "Is crossplay coming soon and if so when?",
            "I have been playing it on Xbox series X since first week of release and it still has many issues.\n\n1. Loading times still not good enough.\n2. Crashes have stopped for now, not sure if because of last big patch or because I finally cleared small cache on Xbox in addition to reinstalling it when it was crashing constantly in the past. I hope they do not come back as those were most irritating.\n3. Inventory UI irritations: Needing to hold right stick to get to detailed item descriptions?! Why? Just let us press one button instead.. Comparison windows are too big, really hard to equip or remove items from slots while comparison windows are up as they cover most of the screen forcing you to shut off comparison before changing equipped items.. When you got ranged weapons in both slots and want to compare new ranged weapon with all slots it only compares with first one, didn't find a way to switch comparison.. not possible to see breakdowns of many values on left side of this screen like dodge, parry, armor and such. Only way to see breakdowns is during combat when you open detailed breakdown of your own characters in same way you do for enemies.\n4. Skill UI irritations: When trying to see which skills I took at what level up, you press A multiple times to open the list of all skills but it does not focus on skill that was chosen but you need to scroll down until you find it.\n5. Combat UI irritations: The circle that show you where you are going to move is often hard to see and often it disappears when you go over your character only to reappear after you move it two tiles away and then return to tile you want. This makes moving 1 tile especially hard.. Next, it is hard to see lines of sight for Psykers if they are holding their staff instead of a ranged weapon. Often I do not know if Indira can use her Scream on a target when I want to move her somewhere like I can for example with Eldar companion that runs around with a sniper.\n6. Skills bar in main screen: I think there are not enough skill slots per bar, it is always irritating to need to switch to next list of skills, we should have a bit smaller icons so it can fit more on 1st skill bar.\n7. Wrong hit chance (especially when using melee vs target that is next to cover) and damage values in preview when choosing targets. Not sure if this is console only or everyone but I had to mention it\n8. Space global stuff was mention in OP so I just wanted to confirm I hope improvements are coming. \u00a0\"Select a system on the global map using the cursor\" has a problem that it never changes the tooltip but always says the name and info of system where stick has last selected it.\n9. As for Traps stuff, we need a button that just tells everyone to stop where they are and not move an inch more. I use autopause on trap discovered and use stick to move everyone in formation (with me first). Often after I find a trap my reaction is try to get everyone to move away which means if you move stick just a bit in opposite reaction formation still moves forward to turn and then to move back... or for pause on trap discovered to also give immediate stop command to everyone."
