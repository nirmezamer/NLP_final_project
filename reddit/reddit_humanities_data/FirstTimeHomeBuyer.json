        "content": "Will keep it short but just wanted to rant \n\nWe have a firm, hard line in the sand $500,000 budget and we told our realtor that. We could afford more, but we don\u2019t want to be house poor. We sent our realtor links to 6 houses we liked within this budget (one was actually $510,000 so I guess that broke my rule by a little bit, but it was just like an idea of what we\u2019re looking for generally). \n\nPrices of houses we were shown/sent:\n\n$700,000\n\n$715,000\n\n$799,000\n\n$645,000\n\n$699,000\n\nI re-iterated to the realtor that our budget was $500k and we only wanted to put down $100k, did not want to have to pay PMI. I again sent some houses in our price range that we liked as a guide for what we\u2019re looking for. \n\nRealtor responded and asked if we would be willing to liquidate some of our 401(k) to get a bigger down payment. I actually laughed out loud reading the email because I couldn\u2019t believe how stupid that idea was. Just responded \u201cI think we\u2019ll be using another realtor, thanks for your time\u201d. \n\nSuddenly she was wanting to schedule tours of the homes I had sent her. Like, why am I doing the work? Why am I sending YOU houses? \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my small rant. Just found it so annoying. ",

            "She wants a bigger payday for herself.  That's all.",
            "You made the right choice. \n\nWho knows what else would have happened if you stayed with that realtor.",
            "We bought our dream house literally a week after firing our realtor. She was holding us back in everything.",
            "Good for you. Liquidating your 401K is terrible advice.",
            "You finding the houses for your realtor doesn\u2019t seem like a red flag to me, both houses I have bought in my life have been ones my wife and I found. With that said, any house we sent over to the realtor was met with a quick response about a walk through and additional information, plus our agent contacting the sellers agent and what not. \n\nMain thing to keep in mind is that they are supposed to be working for you, and if they are not, it\u2019s completely normal to move on.",
            "Yeah that agent was scummy but sending homes to your agent to tour is normal. In fact, it is probably more efficient than having the agent pick out homes that u may not even like and waste both each others time",
            "Looks like she wants a bigger commission",
            "I wish we could just get rid of realtors all together and just pay attorneys to do the paperwork and disclosures. Or, purchasing agents should be paid based on the amount saved from list price or a minimum. When they\u2019re taking a cut of the overall selling price, it feels like they don\u2019t have motivation to negotiate if they know the house is within your budget. Getting 3% for looking up listings, showing the house, and helping with paperwork is crazy. \n\nMaybe 6% total commission made sense when houses were $100-$250k. Now in areas that they\u2019re averaging $400-$600k it seems pretty dumb.",
            "Ai will replace realtors soon. Most people look for their own houses on redfin, realtor, zillow etc and send them to their realtor who then schedules a showing. They are a middle man who refuses to go back to making your venti americano. 5% seller cost to have buyers find your house on a site who then tells their agent to contact your agent... both of those dipshits could be cut out."

This is in no small part due to advice from this sub (including how to leverage a low-ish appraisal to renegotiate the  sales price of the home).  I am not an advice guy and I know times aren\u2019t great, so I will just leave it at:   If you want a home, I sincerely hope it happens for you.  It is a great feeling and offers a real sense of accomplishment.  Thanks all. ",

            "How often do you see borrowers using their max approval limit, versus people being financially educated and understanding they should probably be buying way under the loan approval amount?\n\nWe bought during the pandemic and my wife had lost her job (our income was cut in half), so only my income was counted for the mortgage approval. It was a blessing in disguise, because we bought under the limit approved for just me. Had my wife been included, the limit would've doubled. We know we are financially secure if one of us loses a job has medical issues, etc."
