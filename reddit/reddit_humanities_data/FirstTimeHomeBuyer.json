        "content": "I (37m) just closed today after starting the process in February. Before February I had no idea I would be considering a home. I went from making under $30k annually for the past 3 years until  last year I went to over $50k. I don\u2019t really have family or friends here so I signed, got the keys, and went back to work. I\u2019m now sitting on my bed and just crying in my apartment. I moved to the country just under 6 years ago and I was sleeping on a reclining chair. I\u2019ve questioned myself so much over the past years and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to be called a homeowner now. I\u2019ve just been overwhelmed, exhausted, and emotional. I\u2019ve not eaten since I signed and I\u2019m now going out to treat myself.  What did other people who didn\u2019t have anyone to share this moment with do?  \n\nFor background info the house was sold at $140k. I got $20,500 DPA from my lender. $3,500 credit from seller and another $750 from lender for closing. I paid $0 for closing. My rate is 6.79% conventional and my credit score was 733.",

            "Congratulations! I was on my own too after I closed on my first place. I think going out to eat is the perfect celebratory treat! I drove to the settlement office with a car full of furnishings and headed to unload once the papers were signed and I had the keys. I ordered take out and sat on the deck in my new back yard enjoying my first meal. \n\nI am so happy for you - enjoy owning your own little spot in the country!! \ud83e\udd17",
            "You don't have anyone to share it with?? You have all of us! \ud83e\udef6 Congratulations! It is an overwhelming experience, especially the whiplash of emotions you may go through. Excited, terrified, motivated, defeated. I went through all of these within the first week after closing and by week #2 I was so exhausted that I was definitely questioning my choice. But I'm about two months in now, and appreciating the gift of reaching this huge milestone. You did it!!!! Oh -- and to answer your question, I bought myself a small plant that I put on the windowsill above my sink. First decor in my new home, and I get to look at it every single day. That was my little celebration \u263a\ufe0f",
            "Forget nerves. Pat yourself on the back for doing so well!  Here's my advice: take a deep breath and enjoy your first sunrise and sunset. Don't rush to buy furniture, take your time, and buy what feels right, or you'll wind up with things you don't really like. Save some money for a repair bc something will come up. Buy a small tool kit, assorted nails and screws, and a roll of duct tape. Label your circuit breaker. Get a medium camping lantern from Coleman or Ozark in case of a power failure. That covers basic emergencies. Now, move in and start enjoying your big accomplishment!",

            "Rates may not drop low enough, quickly enough to make refinancing worthwhile. Buy what you can afford at current rates and prices, and consider any opportunity to refinance a bonus. What happens if you overextend yourself now and rate stay above 6% for the next five years?",
            "As long as you don't *assume* the rates will drop and you can refi, then it can still make sense to buy now.",
            "I think this is the basic strategy of most buyers now that are not buying in cash.",
            "Why do assume rates will drop a lot soon?",
            "No it\u2019s totally fine, you just shouldn\u2019t buy if you can only afford it if rates drop because that is never a guarantee. If you can afford it now and find a house you want then go for it and then it\u2019s just a bonus if rates drop later.",

            "It is more difficult than most people realize. We don\u2019t know how quickly rates will come down. Also, when do you refi? Is 6% a good rate? 5%? What if you want to wait until rates get to 5%, but they bottom at 5.5% and creep back up? It\u2019s like trying to pick the bottom on the stock market. For those who bought recently at high prices, they will feel even more pressure to pick the absolute lowest rate possible, but there is no way to know what or when that will be.",
            "Buy what you can afford today, start building equity and stop throwing money away on rent. When rates drop (if they do) then you can refi. I bought last year with that mindset and hope to do a HELOC to do an addition in 3-5 years and then a refi after the buildout is completed provided rates are sub 5.25%."

        "content": "Seller and I agreed to asking price plus $5k towards my closing costs. Everyone had to push her for that $5k because she doesn\u2019t believe in compensating the buyer... But she was ultimately convinced by her daughter to sign the purchase agreement. \n\nAbout a week in she decided she wanted to back out because she was mad she agreed to the $5k and she hated her agent. I wasn\u2019t told about this because they didn\u2019t want me to stress since, according to our contract, she legally can\u2019t back out. They thought she\u2019d come around. After inspection my realtor told me about the situation. She asked if I wanted to back out because the house needs a roof repair and obviously seller wouldn\u2019t cover it. I said I\u2019ll cover the repair and I won\u2019t back out. \n\nMy lender let me know today that everything is wrapped up and we\u2019re ready for closing on our end. Seller is now saying she won\u2019t sign anything over to me, everyone needs to stop calling/texting her and she will NOT sell the house. She has actually screamed insults at her own agent for continuing to contact her. She told her \u201csend me the termination papers and don\u2019t contact me anymore.\u201d\n\nTrying to decide the next step now. I will NOT walk away without compensation for the money I have already spent\u2026 but all I want is the damn house. Seller now owns a home out of state with no family here so I\u2019m not worried about her/anyone else trashing the house if I threaten legal action. I\u2019m going to get a lawyer to send her a threatening message but not sure if it\u2019s worth a full legal battle if she decides to continue being stubborn (which is a definite possibility considering her personality). I want to force the sale and I know I\u2019d need legal counsel but I guess I just want opinions on if it\u2019s worth it or not. I\u2019m frustrated, this house is everything I wanted.",

We found another place in a nicer community  (but not near as nice of a home), and our move in date was only 5 days later, but man, were we bummed.",
            "You will likely win in a lawsuit, but if a legal threat doesn't work, you are probably wise to just back out and start all over again on your house search.",

            "She technically owes her broker the commission now too since they found a willing and able buyer at her asking price. You can threaten to sue and see if she comes around. If you really want the house and she won't cooperate then you would have to take her to court to force the sale.",

Probably not but it still really sucks.",

Someone liek that is a lose cannon I\u2019d be worried she\u2019d show up . I\u2019d possibly do a civil suit for the money ? Bring your contract ect then your not paying a lawyer .",
            "You can sue for specific performance but it\u2019s not really something I recommend due to how long it takes and you typically have to put all the cash in escrow. Talk to your lawyer. She may go ahead when you try to sue for your costs.",
