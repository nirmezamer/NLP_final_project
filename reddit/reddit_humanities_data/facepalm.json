She can sit in the car, she can get own table and buy her own food and drinks, or y'all can set up location tracking on your phones. I'm a woman, and I would never behave like this, and I wouldn't expect a first date to pay for my friend's food and drinks. Why would any dude want an awkward as hell three person first date, let alone to have to pay for the uninvited addition?",
            "Why don\u2019t people just pay for their own stuff?",
            "That's the appropriate response, well welcome to bring a friend to feel safe but she's not part of the date deal.",
