            "Sara-Nicole Morales was shot and killed in the front yard of her mother's house in Orange City, Florida, United States. \nWhile returning home from her job at a Volusia County library, she had become embroiled in a road rage incident with a local motorcyclist, during which she had intentionally struck his vehicle with hers, an act witnessed by two nearby motorists. \nThe three notified police and followed her to the house, where she confronted them with her fianc\u00e9's pistol. The motorcyclist drew his own gun and shot her five times.\n\n\n**Charges**\nNone - shooting was found to be justifiable homicide\n\nMorales, who was reported by her mother to be five months pregnant, was pronounced dead following arrival at a nearby hospital. The shooter, who had a concealed carry permit, was taken into police custody and released pending the investigation. Authorities were unable to confirm her pregnancy during the autopsy. Four months later the local prosecutor's office announced it had found the shooting justified as self-defense and would not be filing charges.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Sara-Nicole_Morales",
            "So was she pregnant or not?? If autopsy was unable to verify a pregnancy, sounds like that part maybe shouldn\u2019t be in the headline",
            "She was safe in her home. What could she possibly have thought to gain by going outside armed to confront someone?",
            "Well first off this lady hit a dude on a motorcycle with her car in a road rage incident. Then that guy and his friend followed her home ( she ran from a hit and run what do you expect when you hit a guy on a motorcycle intentionally a pat on the back ?) got to her house and immediately came outside brandishing a gun( not even her own firearm it was her boyfriends ) only to then immediately get shot 5 times and lose her life. By the guy she hit with her car who was legally concealed carrying. So he ended up getting off free and clear( I believe because he didn\u2019t take out his weapon or anything util she came out gun in hand). And I honestly can\u2019t blame the courts. Only problem was he followed her home but again she hit him off his motorcycle and then proceeded to run away from a hit and run. It\u2019s a shame she made every single bad choice available to her. On a completely weird note her mother claims she was pregnant but the coroner was like no she is not. So that\u2019s weird. Or at least it to me shows dishonesty and willingness to lie for sympathy.",
