            "I'm playing **Tchia**! I went in without many expectations and it completely blew me away. There's so much to do! It can be overwhelming when it keeps throwing new activities at you, but I'm just trying to let it all wash over me, and it's been amazing. There's so much love and care in it -- custom animations for EVERY cutscene is bonkers, for example -- and it's actually really lovely to get to experience the life and culture of people I don't know much about (it's set in New Caledonia, off the coast of Australia). I'm so happy!\n\nNext is **Everafter Falls** ",
            "Just started playing **Mineko's Night Market**. Loving the art style and writing, but it's glitchy and the gameplay so far is a little dull. I think it would have been better as a more traditional adventure game. But I'm interested enough in the story right now to keep me going.",
            "Moonstone Island - Its everything I wished Stardew Valley could be. In game tutorial and quest objectives that guide you through gameplay? Check. Slay the spire like combat? Check. Good story? Check. 10/10.",
            "I am still playing and loving Yonder! I play for 45 minutes in the morning as I ride an exercise bike. I've been playing every day since early May and I have a lot left to explore. The time flies!!",
            "I've been playing **Cloudpunk**. Maneuvering vehicles in games has never been my forte and this one is no exception. \n\nI love the environment but am not sure how I feel about the gameplay and story. I like it enough to finish at least. I think the developer's upcoming **Nivalis** game might be more my thing.",
            "Moonstone Island and Im disappointed.",
            "Still playing Harvest Moon Island of Happiness. And finally, my daughter is able to crawl and my wife Lanna even has new flavor text. Also, Elliot and Julia returned with their new child. It took five in game years but it was worth it. I feel really enthusiastic after the game was kind of getting repetitive. Just need to get Sabrina with Vaughn and Natalie with Pierre next summer.",
            "Still enjoying **Palia** on the other side of my recuperation, Switch-port jankiness and all. I think it will make a decent ongoing \"dip into for a while alongside other games\" title for me.\n\nUnfortunately, I kind of bounced off **Strange Horticulture**, which surprised me; I like puzzles, plants, and gothic vibes, so you'd think I'd be the prime target. But I can't seem to follow the plot for some reason, and the music keeps bumming me out.  Definitely a Me Problem.",
            "Wife and I just finished another summit play through for Stardew 1.6. We started looking for games as we got close to finishing. Lo and behold I found one, Everafter Falls!\n\nWe were beyond stoked to see it has split screen coop! We played the demo and loved it so this is next on our plate.",

        "content": "Any Steam sale discussions should be posted here. Feel free to ask questions, post deals, etc. \n\nBefore you buy: Steam is not always the cheapest, even during a sale. Check www.isthereanydeal.com for other legit code websites. The only issue is you can't refund a code if you don't buy it from Steam so do your research. Steam does have a generous return policy if you are on the fence. \n\nMost games going on sale have been mentioned here plenty of times so search the sub for posts ad most of your questions will most likely have been answered. \n\nMost importantly: it's okay if you can't buy everything you want now! I know there can be a lot of stress with wanting to buy a lot, even if it's outside of our means (I know I've done it). But the games aren't going anywhere and there are sales all the time. Take care of yourself! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udf38\n\nI turned off my reply notifications so my phone isn't blowing up like Gandalf's fireworks but if you need me, send me a message or tag me. ",

            "Oh I might finally get Sun Haven. 50% off",
            "Like every Steam sale, there are things I'm very mildly interested in for 90% off and all the stuff I'm really interested in is 30% off. Which is a good deal if I'm going to buy it soon anyway, but not so much if I don't expect I'll get around to it for another year. \n\nSo the only thing I'm buying for sure so far is American Truck Simulator I guess! There are also a bunch of visual novels under $10 that I'll probably snatch up. Heavily debating whether or not to buy Persona 3 because I haven't played a real action game in like 3 years but I kind of have the Persona itch. But I tried playing the PS2 and PSP versions years ago but the school parts didn't feel nearly as cozy as 4 & 5 did. :( I also never did play Royal so that's an option too I guess.",

            "My husband just surprised me with a receipt for a steam deck he bought me for our anniversary so Im super excited for this sale. We only had Macs, Xbox, and switch prior to this. \n\nI am thinking about getting Enshrouded, little known galaxy, and distant bloom. Has anyone heard anything about distant bloom? It looks adorable.",
            "tempted to get sun haven but I've been holding out for the switch port... such a good deal though </3",
            "My initial yes pile is Paleo Pines, Minami Lane, ibento, and Cats Organized Neatly. My \"needs more research\" pile is Spirittea, Sun Haven, and Moonstone Island. I'll likely get one of those three but unsure which.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14's new expansion starts tomorrow so I know that will be competing for my free time for a while.",
