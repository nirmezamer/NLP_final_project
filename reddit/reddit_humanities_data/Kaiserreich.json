Shifting away from Europe, we turn to China once more, where Hunan is put in the spotlight with its existing content getting a complete overhaul, featuring a new narrative with many new characters. This is accompanied by some smaller changes to Fengtian, Mongolia, Shanxi, and Yunnan, as well as some other broader Chinese updates. And across the Pacific, we are also giving some overdue attention to Central America, with several small tweaks to the content of its constituent countries, and most notably with a revamp of socialist Centroamerica. As expected, this larger, non-save compatible update also includes many other small additions and fixes that we\u2019ve been working on. We hope you enjoy 1.1.4!\n\nNote: As a reminder, both Player-Led Peace Conferences and the State Transfer Tool have already been integrated directly into Kaiserreich and can be accessed via the Game Rules menu before starting a game. We occasionally get reports of people running into bugs while having the separate versions of these submods running, so this is just to make sure you are all aware that you don\u2019t need separate mods for either any more, and haven't needed them for over two years!\n\n**\\- The KR4 team**\n\n***\n\n#Changes\n\n###Notable Additions\n- Overhauled almost all of Hunan\u2019s existing content, with completely new national foci, paths, events, decisions, and mechanics.
