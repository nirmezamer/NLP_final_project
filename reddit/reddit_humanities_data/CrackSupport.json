        "content": "Hello redditors,\n\nWe have received numerous copyright strikes for the past few weeks. All of them are related to cracked software support (Adobe, FL studio, and other such programs). Few of the examples: \n\n[Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/ONDqFia.png)\n[Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/WpcJeBS.png)\n[Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/v1I0lB7.png)\n\nTo ensure this subreddit continues to operate and not get banned by Reddit admins, we are shutting down all the support about software-related content. You can only ask for content related to video games. All of the future questions about software piracy will be deleted.\n\nI am sorry that this happened, but such measures have to be taken to ensure this subreddit continues to operate. You can create another subreddit related to software piracy, though I would not advise, as Reddit is more likely to take down content related to software piracy than video game piracy. \n\nAll of the previous questions relating to software piracy will be deleted to avoid more copyright strikes.",

I jus downloaded and installed the DLC (shadow of the erdtree), I changed the save file for mine and my game won't even start up. At the title it says failed to load save the file, I checked online it's a known fix to prevent swapping save files. Any solution I check online is for Steam or other platform. \n\nDoes anyone here knows a workaround? I don't want to finish the game again and move on to the DLC.\n\nI appreciate any help you can provide.",
