After ordering I waited 20 minutes and nobody had gone to get it. Once they finally assigned somebody he began sitting at his house on GPS for 15 min. On my way home I said fuck it and I drove to Jack in the Box, beat him there, picked up the order for my own name and canceled it while they handed over the bag. I know everyone still got paid but I thought it was funny lol ",

            "I once logged in as a dasher after ordering some McDonald\u2019s from like two miles away and no dashers taking the order ($6 tip and very low traffic main roads between where I was and the store.) so I was like fuck it and logged in to dash. My order was the first thing it pushed at me. Got my 6 dollars back plus $4 because my order was sitting so long.",
            "I had a customer who picked up his own pizza once.  It was a small town middle of nowhere with no tip on a Friday night.  But I had just dropped of an order, and was gonna make 2 50 for my drive back so I accepted.  Owner told me what happened,  no signal couldn't get thru to support.  So I just hit complete as I drove by his house without even slowing down.",
            "So did you tell Jack in the Box what the deal was or did they just let you walk in and believed you were the dasher for said order? lol",
            "You canceled the order but everyone got paid? How does that work exactly?",
            "There was one time I saw the dasher sitting at a park for 30 minutes and I had gone on my lunch break  10 minutes into that 30 minute wait cause if they picked it up in 20 they should of been there with time for me to eat.  Well I clocked back in and they're still at the park.  I called support and told them about the wait and what I see and they're are all no they are at the restaurant.   I was like that's not what I see I'm already back from my lunch with nor eating I'd like too just get cancel and get my money back.  They said I can cancel but I won't get a refund.  I was like why,  they said policy they are there.  I said they aren't they never went to the location they drove  and went the opposite direction and parked at a local park.   They said no,  so I said well when am I supposed to get this I'm already back on the clock.  They said soon.   20 minutes later, so 1 hour 20 minutes all together they texted saying my driver is now so and so and is on his way to the restaurant.  I just laughed and was able to eat on the clock because I showed my boss everything and he was like fuck that app.  I haven't ordered since but that's the one weird order I've had,  usually it's 35 minutes.",

            "I live about 28miles country roads/15miles toll highway away from the nearest shopping center and I asked my wife to order some tacobell as soon as I was ready to go home, I told that I was going to be the one taking the order. And she was skeptical. \n\nI drove to the tacobell this was 10PM I probably waited 20min after she had ordered it then I get the offer on my screen. The order came in at $10.50+ for 18mi on toll I took it. It ended up being $24.75 when I delivered it. My wife then told me she tipped $20 because she didn\u2019t want to have another driver drop it off and not have a tip. \n\nSo the order ended up being $24.75 for 16.5mi, I got \u201cpaid\u201d and got a trip home so no dead miles \ud83e\udd23\n\ninb4 pics or it didn\u2019t happen: I recently deleted a bunch of screenshots from DD and I deleted those screenshots so no pics \ud83d\ude2b",
            "I\u2019ve noticed as a driver that if the tip isn\u2019t high enough people will not take it.\nI went to Papa Johns before, it was $6 for 2 miles late at night so I said why not, get there to find out the pizza was sitting for over an hour, customer got tired of waiting so picked it up himself. \nThe restaurant never remade the pizza or even offered. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22"

I got a text message saying that my order had been delivered, along with a link to a picture of the delivery.

I figured that since she had sent a photo of the delivery (which I hadn\u2019t seen) she had maybe brought it to the wrong address and took a picture there, and realized her mistake when she heard me open the door.  She handed my order to me and I thanked her, and didn\u2019t think anything else of it until I went back inside and actually opened the picture of the supposed delivery. \n\nShe hadn\u2019t delivered it to the wrong address. She had definitely taken a picture of the food on my doorstep, but was nowhere near my doorstep with the food when I opened the door. I\u2019m pretty sure I caught her walking away with my order, and if I hadn\u2019t opened the door when I did she would have left with it. \n\nAm I overreacting? Is there some other way to read this situation that I\u2019m missing?
