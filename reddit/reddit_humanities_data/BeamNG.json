            "Nah, it doesn't have to be really fast, and I find it really good in more muddy terrains since it's an amphibious vehicle, unfortunately BeamNG doesn't have really much muddy terrains, so I feel like it came out to the game too early tho. Since I learned that before taking a turn you need to speed up a bit I didn't had any problems with the clutch at all, okay, custom version still has some little problems with the clutch, but it was probably tuned by some bad mechanic, and even the base version is enough for me so I don't use custom one."
