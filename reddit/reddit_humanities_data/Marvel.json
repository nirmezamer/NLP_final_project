            "Alex Ross does gorgeous covers, one of the best to ever do it. But to be the greatest comic book artist you need to be able to actually draw comic books imo, and Ross has never been a consistent interiors guy. That's obviously not to say he's never done them - Kingdom Come and Marvels are beautiful books, but he only really does prestige mini series because his work is timely and expensive. \n\nFor my money the greatest of all time comic artists are probably still either John Byrne or George Prez, thought I also have to shout out the evergreen classics like The King Jack Kirby and John Romita Sr",
            "By the way, this suit is just awesome. I really like how the design manages to feel much more high budge without loosing the classic aesthetic.",
            "Greatest *cover artist*. His art doesnt work as well for interior.",
            "Best cover artist by miles. Kingdom Come was awesome as well!",
            "I really like him but sometimes the realism makes certain things worse, like for some reason whenever he draws a human character he always makes them seem a lot more older than they are",
            "In cover? I agree. In interior? Idk, his art feel WAY too static. When ever he draw action scenes, it just feel like there is 0 flow in the panels.",
            "Hes definitely one of the greats, though Id attribute THE greatest to be either Kirby, Ditko or Romita Sr.",
            "Nah. Too painterly, and you can see the models posing. Tell a story purely visually like Ditko and we'll talk.",
            "I'm not that exposed to Alex Ross' interior art work. I started reading comics in the 90s and I'm partial to the latter outputs of Joe Madureira. For me, his artwork is the most expressive and dynamic of the era. Even his pencils on his concepts for his video games were mesmerizing for me.",
            "Who did Secret War with cap and spidey and Luke and wolverine  with their cool midnight suns-esque costumes, was that Alex Ross?  Cause that was gorgeous."
