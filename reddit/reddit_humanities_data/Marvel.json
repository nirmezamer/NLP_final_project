Like Dylan being big like Brock makes no sense because his joints are in different places.",

So when the jaw opens its because their jaw has been made fluid and reconfigured to be the way it needed to be.\n\nThis is based on nothing but just what I thought and made sense to me.",

            "I\u2019ve always just thought of it happening this way already lol",

            "Thor - You loved the movies and were happy that they made him a better character as a result.\n\nSentry - You chose this one to be different, didn't you?\n\nSpider-Man - This is the correct choice, well done.\n\nBlack Cat - WE GET IT YOU'RE HORNY (we all are too it's okay!)",
            " It\u2019s clear that you really enjoy characters with redemption arch\u2019s as one of their defining arch\u2019s. Thor being casted out and becoming worthy again, sentry trying to do good as a hero and recover from his past traumas, Spider-Man with him letting the thief go who proceeded to kill uncle Ben (and I mean who doesn\u2019t like Him), and black cat who\u2019s almost always \u201ctrying\u201d to be more of a hero. Like in Dan Slots Big time. These are all hero\u2019s who have done bad or allowed bad to happen. But ultimately the rise above it and serve the greater good rather then letting their past define them. I think it shows that you may have some what of a guilty conscience and that you\u2019re always looking to do better or be better. It could be that you hurt someone in a way you didn\u2019t mean to, or maybe you used to be highschool flash Thompson and now you\u2019re trying to be agent venom. Either way I believe this shows you\u2019re willing to grow and that you\u2019re over all a person who seeks to earn forgiveness and trust.",
