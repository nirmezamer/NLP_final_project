        "content": "The bay area is the focus of a lot of political controversy, both for legitimate issues in the area and in comparison to other, politically different areas around the country. The discussions about these issues often attract very strong opinions from users who only come to the subreddit to argue about them. This causes lots of extra work for us moderators, and also draws otherwise rule abiding users into heated arguments. We have decided to address this by restricting such discussions to only established members of the subreddit. We don't want to favor one political viewpoint over any others, so we run a moderation bot that applies the same, unbiased criteria to all posts about politics or crime.\n\nWhen commenting on these posts, the bot will automatically remove your comment without notice if you don't have an established history of commenting or posting in the subreddit. We intentionally aren't stating the exact requirements, or how close individual accounts are to meeting them, but they do require a low, but consistent amount of commenting or posting over a period of several months. If you do comment on one of the posts and your comment is removed, it doesn't count towards your accumulation of history, but there's also no penalty for doing so.\n\nPosting has the same requirements, but also requires that you not have posted a political/crime post in the last week. We also require that all such posts be only a link to a news article or official statement from a reporter or official. No self posts, image or video posts are allowed on these subjects.\n\nThese filters will be automatically applied if the flair of the post is \"Politics & Local Crime\". If you don't meet the requirements for posting and try to get around the filter by posting under a different flair, you can be automatically banned.\n\nThe restrictions do not apply to non-controversial posts under any other flair, so feel free to post and comment on everything else the bay has to offer.\n\n\n\nNew rule changes, flairs and updated styling\n\nHello everyone! We've given the sub a bit of a makeover, here's a summary of the changes.\n\n### New Rules:\n\nWe've rewritten the whole rules list. For the most part this won't result in any enforcement changes, but will hopefully make our rules more clear, give people more detailed report reasons to use and let us moderators give more clear feedback when removing comments and posts. Here are the new rules\n\n1. No poor or hostile behavior\n * No personal attacks or hostile language against your fellow redditors. Hostile language against public figures and organizations is allowed as long as it's not overly egregious.\n2. No racism or other hate speech\n * Do not directly or indirectly suggest someone has done something because of their race. Pointing out other people's racism is allowed as long as it doesn't cross the line of being a personal attack.\n3. No advocating violence\n * Don't suggest or glorify that people should be killed, maimed or shot, either by vigilantes or the legal system. Recommending people legally arm themselves is fine as long as it's not accompanied by any suggestion of wanting to use the weapon against someone.\n4. No duplicate posts\n * If a topic has been posted in the last few days, only posts with substantial new information are allowed.\n5. No advertising\n * Advertising anything that you or anyone associated with you makes money off of is not allowed. Giveaways, fundraisers and bayclub membership posts are not allowed. Pet adoption posts are allowed. Recommending free events or groups is fine. Send us a modmail if you are unsure whether this applies to your case or to ask for an exception.\n6. No unverified or mislabeled crime posts\n * All posts about crime need a news article from a reputable organization or a statement from a state official or police force. They also must be correctly flaired.\n7. No unverified contact information in missing person posts\n * Posts about missing people can only recommend contacting a police department. They can contain the publicly available phone number for the police department, but not any other numbers. Lost pet posts are fine and don't have this restriction.\n8. Posts must be about the bay area\n * Topics that are relevant to the bay but aren't directly in the bay are allowed, such as news about a wildfire blowing smoke through, or people getting trapped on the road to Tahoe. But there must be some relation to the bay area.\n\n### New Flairs:\n\nWe have updated the list of post flairs and also turned on the setting to require post flairs on submission. This will hopefully make the subreddit a bit easier to browser, while also cleaning up enforcement of our enhanced moderation on politics and crime posts. Here are the new flairs\n\n* Politics & Local Crime\n* Events, Activities & Sports\n* Work & Housing\n* Traffic, Trains & Transit\n* Food, Shopping & Services\n* Fluff & Memes\n* Scenes from the Bay\n* Earthquakes, Weather & Disasters\n\nWe're open to adding a couple more flairs if these prove insufficient.\n\n### New Style:\n\nWe've updated the banner image, subreddit icon and style colors as well as a lot of other minor detail settings.\n\nBig thanks to u/MistaKimsta who [took the picture used in the banner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ghf8i5/rolling_hills_of_east_bay/).\n\n### Updated enhanced moderation:\n\nWe set up the enhanced moderation bot a couple years ago and it's proved an invaluable tool for allowing discussion about controversial topics between people who actually use the subreddit, while excluding those who just come here to brigade the sub. There were two notable issues we're addressing with today's changes.\n\nFirst was people not adding the politics or crime flairs to the post, which meant enhanced moderation wasn't turned on till hours later when a mod came around and changed the flair. This should be resolved by requiring flair on all posts now, and automatically banning people who intentionally chose the wrong flair.\n\nSecond was a small subset of people making the majority of the political/crime posts. This will be resolved by restricting such posts to one per week per user.\n\n[You can read more about the details of the enhanced moderation changes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/195xvo5/restrictions_that_apply_to_political_and_crime/).\n\n### Open to feedback:\n\nIt's been a long time since there were any substantial rule or style changes to the sub, so we're very open to feedback about all these changes. And especially the sub icon, banner image and the list of post flairs.\n\nWe hope this makes the subreddit better for everyone!",

As such would it be alright to call said person out including pejorative such as stupid or idiot.\n\n>X groups of people deserve Y negative treatment b/c they are X\n\nA blanket and stereotype statement such as above is obviously wrong b/c there is no way an entire group of people in the hundreds of thousands or more all behaves and believes the same.  So would pejoratives such as bigots be acceptable \n\n>Bay Area shouldn\u2019t change for X b/c it would change Y perception for me therefore it\u2019s bad change\n\nPost like this typically are brought up by NIMBYS when talking about changes to housing to make Bay Area more accessible and affordable.  Would calling these people out being selfish and entitled count as personal or poor behavior\n\n>Stating that X dog breeds are very safe and well behaved animals while getting super defensive when confronted even though statistical founding on dog attack states differently\n\nIn that scenario would it be alright to call out personal attacks such as being ignorant and stupid for purposefully ignoring reality while spreading a misinformation.\n\n>spreading of misinformation and refuse to acknowledge counter point or verified information \n\nWould calling out personal attacks in this scenario be allowed and to what degree?\n\n\n\nNot trying to start a fight with anyone, but some people are wrong in their view or beliefs due to ignorance, lack of knowledge or personal gain.  So would calling these people personally out be poor behavior\n\n\n[Very crude but relevant quote why some people should be called out.](https://youtu.be/E7Sr-cpFwUc?si=vwjhVUOiZGbOYXz-)\n\n\n\nAs for icon change of the sub, it\u2019s so generic I had no idea it was the Bay Area sub.\n\nWhy not just a picture of the Bay Area map as icon picture?\n\n[This one](https://149725886.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/map_04-20-21_300dpi_27.22x18.13_inv2318c-scaled.jpg)\n\n[This topography looking one](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/c2/5f/22c25f1ca3d529d2dbe80fc8d2eb8c73.jpg)\n\nBridge Icon would make sense too since we have several bridges connecting each bay side",
            "I heartily endorse these changes.\n\nI liked the older image fine! If we're going with this, I propose that the green hills image only get used til the end of the wet season, to then be replaced by a ~~brown~~ \"golden\" hills image. \ud83d\ude0e",
            "I like this.  Way too many people who have never even been to the area commenting.",
            "100% support these updates.\n\nI really hope it cuts down on outsiders (people that don't or have never lived in CA or the Bay) screwing with discussions - twisting, spinning, or redirecting topics.\n\nI also hope it curbs the volatility of honest discussions.\n\nI hope sub users ask more questions to learn instead of trying to stomp on each other for some sort of dopamine fix."

I\u2019m going 75 in the left lane and I see you bearing down on me, closing the gap. Cool, I\u2019ll merge right and let you pass. Oh, you merged right too, ok, maybe your exit is coming up I guess. I\u2019ll wait til it\u2019s safe to get back in the left lane then. Other cars are passing left now. Aaand you\u2019re now weaving around, passing on the right. Holy shit, watch out for that car merging onto the highway, damn that was close, car behind you almost rear ended you since you had to slam on the brakes. I\u2019ll just signal to get back in the left lane once it\u2019s\u2026well I\u2019m going to wait while that jeep swerves across 4 lanes to the off-ramp, why didn\u2019t you start getting over like a mile ago? K cool, now I\u2019m in the left lane, looks like there\u2019s some traffic, huh no we\u2019re just all going like 60 now because there\u2019s a Prius with it\u2019s lights off 3 cars ahead going that slow. It\u2019s 9pm and raining, turn your lights on. And speed up or merge right! Everyone to our right is going faster than us! Shit I\u2019ll merge to the right so I can pass GODDAMN WERE YOU IN MY BLINDSPOT THIS WHOLE TIME?? How did I not see your huge lifted truck with your \u201cblue lives matter\u201d flag? I\u2019d honk but you\u2019re probably buzzed and packing heat.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, here in the Bay, people are driving fast, but there\u2019s some order. The left lanes are faster, if you wanna drive the speed limit you generally are in the 2 right lanes. There will always be maniacs who weave on the highway, but here they tend to stay in the left 2 lanes, or maybe even signal when they\u2019re about to pass you!\u00a0",

            "I\u2019ve driven all over the country and lived in a few different spots, I agree NorCal drivers are my favorites. I love that the flow of traffic on the highways is 75-80 when not in traffic, and the Bay Area is BY FAR the best about left lane camping. Sure it happens here, but far less than most of the rest of the country.\n\nDrivers are generally assertive here, but at least consistently so. I can anticipate that all the other drivers will be assertive/aggressive and drive accordingly. \n\nBaltimore is a shit show. CO between Denver and Colorado Springs is Mad Max mayhem. Washington state is passive, oblivious, and takes special pride in driving side by side across all lanes of the freeway going exactly the same speed. Most of the Midwest can\u2019t merge for shit, camps in the left lane, and takes personal offense to being passed. NJ/NY are\u2026well their own hellscape. Florida is a terrible combo of octogenarians unable to participate in the society around them and nut jobs unwilling to do so.",
