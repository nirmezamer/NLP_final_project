        "content": "The bay area is the focus of a lot of political controversy, both for legitimate issues in the area and in comparison to other, politically different areas around the country. The discussions about these issues often attract very strong opinions from users who only come to the subreddit to argue about them. This causes lots of extra work for us moderators, and also draws otherwise rule abiding users into heated arguments. We have decided to address this by restricting such discussions to only established members of the subreddit. We don't want to favor one political viewpoint over any others, so we run a moderation bot that applies the same, unbiased criteria to all posts about politics or crime.\n\nWhen commenting on these posts, the bot will automatically remove your comment without notice if you don't have an established history of commenting or posting in the subreddit. We intentionally aren't stating the exact requirements, or how close individual accounts are to meeting them, but they do require a low, but consistent amount of commenting or posting over a period of several months. If you do comment on one of the posts and your comment is removed, it doesn't count towards your accumulation of history, but there's also no penalty for doing so.\n\nPosting has the same requirements, but also requires that you not have posted a political/crime post in the last week. We also require that all such posts be only a link to a news article or official statement from a reporter or official. No self posts, image or video posts are allowed on these subjects.\n\nThese filters will be automatically applied if the flair of the post is \"Politics & Local Crime\". If you don't meet the requirements for posting and try to get around the filter by posting under a different flair, you can be automatically banned.\n\nThe restrictions do not apply to non-controversial posts under any other flair, so feel free to post and comment on everything else the bay has to offer.\n\n\n\nNew rule changes, flairs and updated styling\n\nHello everyone! We've given the sub a bit of a makeover, here's a summary of the changes.\n\n### New Rules:\n\nWe've rewritten the whole rules list. For the most part this won't result in any enforcement changes, but will hopefully make our rules more clear, give people more detailed report reasons to use and let us moderators give more clear feedback when removing comments and posts. Here are the new rules\n\n1. No poor or hostile behavior\n * No personal attacks or hostile language against your fellow redditors. Hostile language against public figures and organizations is allowed as long as it's not overly egregious.\n2. No racism or other hate speech\n * Do not directly or indirectly suggest someone has done something because of their race. Pointing out other people's racism is allowed as long as it doesn't cross the line of being a personal attack.\n3. No advocating violence\n * Don't suggest or glorify that people should be killed, maimed or shot, either by vigilantes or the legal system. Recommending people legally arm themselves is fine as long as it's not accompanied by any suggestion of wanting to use the weapon against someone.\n4. No duplicate posts\n * If a topic has been posted in the last few days, only posts with substantial new information are allowed.\n5. No advertising\n * Advertising anything that you or anyone associated with you makes money off of is not allowed. Giveaways, fundraisers and bayclub membership posts are not allowed. Pet adoption posts are allowed. Recommending free events or groups is fine. Send us a modmail if you are unsure whether this applies to your case or to ask for an exception.\n6. No unverified or mislabeled crime posts\n * All posts about crime need a news article from a reputable organization or a statement from a state official or police force. They also must be correctly flaired.\n7. No unverified contact information in missing person posts\n * Posts about missing people can only recommend contacting a police department. They can contain the publicly available phone number for the police department, but not any other numbers. Lost pet posts are fine and don't have this restriction.\n8. Posts must be about the bay area\n * Topics that are relevant to the bay but aren't directly in the bay are allowed, such as news about a wildfire blowing smoke through, or people getting trapped on the road to Tahoe. But there must be some relation to the bay area.\n\n### New Flairs:\n\nWe have updated the list of post flairs and also turned on the setting to require post flairs on submission. This will hopefully make the subreddit a bit easier to browser, while also cleaning up enforcement of our enhanced moderation on politics and crime posts. Here are the new flairs\n\n* Politics & Local Crime\n* Events, Activities & Sports\n* Work & Housing\n* Traffic, Trains & Transit\n* Food, Shopping & Services\n* Fluff & Memes\n* Scenes from the Bay\n* Earthquakes, Weather & Disasters\n\nWe're open to adding a couple more flairs if these prove insufficient.\n\n### New Style:\n\nWe've updated the banner image, subreddit icon and style colors as well as a lot of other minor detail settings.\n\nBig thanks to u/MistaKimsta who [took the picture used in the banner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ghf8i5/rolling_hills_of_east_bay/).\n\n### Updated enhanced moderation:\n\nWe set up the enhanced moderation bot a couple years ago and it's proved an invaluable tool for allowing discussion about controversial topics between people who actually use the subreddit, while excluding those who just come here to brigade the sub. There were two notable issues we're addressing with today's changes.\n\nFirst was people not adding the politics or crime flairs to the post, which meant enhanced moderation wasn't turned on till hours later when a mod came around and changed the flair. This should be resolved by requiring flair on all posts now, and automatically banning people who intentionally chose the wrong flair.\n\nSecond was a small subset of people making the majority of the political/crime posts. This will be resolved by restricting such posts to one per week per user.\n\n[You can read more about the details of the enhanced moderation changes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/195xvo5/restrictions_that_apply_to_political_and_crime/).\n\n### Open to feedback:\n\nIt's been a long time since there were any substantial rule or style changes to the sub, so we're very open to feedback about all these changes. And especially the sub icon, banner image and the list of post flairs.\n\nWe hope this makes the subreddit better for everyone!",

            "Of all the changes, Im most relieved about no more Bay Club membership posts. Even though it usually gets posted about a meme, what about the show that shall not be named? They already do so much marketing which is what theyre known for and here, made fun of for, but sometimes the excessive posts feels like free publicity for a shitty org. \n\nEDIT: there are many informative comments on these posts denouncing the org and show but theres no such thing as bad publicity. A limit on these types of posts could be useful.",
            "*Really* interested to see how these new rules play out. Especially since some other Bay Area oriented subs have critiqued this one (and vice versa) for certain things, and the new rules seem to address some of that.",

It was a game malfunction. \n\nMe and my brothers asked if we can redo the puzzle to at least solve it, and were told we cannot and there is nothing he can do. I went ahead and emailed them and explained the situation to ask for a refund. They told me \u201cthe game did not malfunction. You got the full experience. We offered for you to replay the puzzle which you rudely refused.\u201d Which is not true at all. We were told in person that we could not replay and there was nothing we can do.
