Crossplay and Events will be unavailable to Xbox players until the update goes live on the platform.~~*\n\nCompensation for XBOX players: Log-in before June 20 to receive 3.000.000 BloodPoints and 300 Gilded Trinkets.\n\n# Features:\n\nThemed generators, hooks, lockers and the \"Father Campbell\u2019s Chapel\" map.\n\nBloodweb Itens: Masquerade Flashlights, Toolboxes, Medkits, and offering.\n\n# MEET TRYKS\n\nThis year\u2019s Masquerade marks the arrival of the host du jour, a figure as enigmatic as she is eccentric, as gleefully unhinged as the most exhilarating nightmare. Though she goes by many names, you will come to know her primarily as **Tryks**. In fact, she happens to play a central role in this year\u2019s gameplay event. On that note...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94yp475qxc6d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf3366f4836141b29b46bb4c07846616ce76bfc6\n\n# INVITING TROUBLE\n\nInvitations will be placed throughout every Trial, placed atop an ornate Masquerade Pillar. Grabbing one grants abilities:\n\n**SURVIVOR**\n\n* Block a window vault for the Killer.\n* Spawn a Fragile Pallet whether in and out of a chase.\n* Activate Quiet mode, which lowers your footsteps, breathing, grunts of pain, and entering/exiting a locker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnp958k6yc6d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2451bdb52d690f8e5f30d1335efb0c280eb444f0\n\n**KILLER**\n\n* Teleport a Survivor directly to a Hook when carrying them on your shoulders.\n* Remotely break a Pallet\n* Reduce the impact of a stun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5md0inq7yc6d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9490e7f8ffecf802173304ac3ff6fcf91903535d\n\nOnce an Invitation ability is activated, the charge is used up and you must find another one. You can carry maximum of 2 Invitations at a time, and charges will regenerate over time.\n\n# BAG OF TRYKS\n\nHaving an invitation in your back pocket can be advantageous, but there\u2019s another wildcard at play. Literally \u2013 a *wild* card courtesy of Tryks, who isn\u2019t exactly known for playing with a full deck.\n\nAt the beginning of every Trial a set of 5 cards will be randomly selected to impact the match. Once revealed, they will activate in order, with the first card activating at the beginning of the Trial.\n\nOnce the Trial begins, players will be able to activate the next card by collectively earning points through in-game actions like Hooking a Survivor for the first time or finishing a Generators. After 2 points, a new card will Activate, replacing the previous one.\n\nWhat do the cards do, you ask?\n\n* **You're Invited** \\- All players instantly receive a charged Invitation.\n* **No Invite For You!** \\- All players instantly lose an Invitation.\n* **Peekaboo!** \\- All players have their Aura briefly revealed.\n* **Move It Or Lose It!** \\- All players gain a Haste bonus for a duration.\n* **Heal You, Expose You!** \\- All injured Survivors are healed and immediately Exposed.\n* **Wait, Where...?** \\- Survivors leave no Scratch Marks and the Killer is Undetectable.\n* **Party Totem!** \\- All Dull Totems are revealed and transform to Anniversary Totems, which remain until the next card.\n* **Party Chest!** \\- All unopen Chests become Anniversary Chests.\n* **Zzl Zilch!** \\- Nothing happens.\n\n# EVENT TOME & UNLOCKABLES\n\nThe Twisted Masquerade introduces a new Event Tome, featuring 3 levels of Challenges and 3 Community Challenges to complete.
