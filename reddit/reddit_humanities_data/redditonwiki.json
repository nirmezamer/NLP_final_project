            "You are not wrong, hormones or not.  He let you deal with this all alone, he went out to enjoy himself rather than stay with you and help you through your difficult time.",
            "He's a piece of shit. When people show you who they are, believe them. Dump his ass.",
            "He's a POS. Going out to party with friends and then calling a girl even if she is a friend to vent personal information to WHILE ignoring his partner the entire night. Dude just wants to be the center of attention is my view on it but it honestly could be he's just inconsiderate and doesn't truly care about her.",
            "Hope she dumps him ASAP. What a complete and total POS. As if ignoring her all night isnt bad enough, but to then try to leverage that trauma as an in to HER friend (bc why else would he reach out while continuing to ignore his partner actually going through said trauma)? Thats a whole new scummy low.",
            "  More red flags than a communist picnic.",
            "What a terrible thing for him to do to you. Im so sorry that you had to go through so much of this alone.\n\nHe does, obviously, need space. However, Im thinking he really needs the kind of space that hed encounter when being shoved out of the airlock of the ISS. Too bad NASA doesnt do that as a service",
            "BTW, everyone, AVOID THE ORIGINAL COMMENTS. A serious POS MRA has entered the chat and is trying to claim that the OP's partner abandoning her and needing \"alone time\" is reasonable.",
            "I was just on this post and I really hope that she went forward with it and dumped him. She deserves better.",
            "Poor girl. Miscarriages are really traumatic, and Im glad she had sense to go to the Dr because her miscarriage was very serious. Having experienced pregnancy loss myself, I can imagine how terrified and traumatized OP was, and her partner hasnt a clue. Im concerned she didnt reach out to any of her girlfriends, especially when her BF left her alone and she was frantically calling him. It makes me think hes isolating her. And making a woman think pregnancy hormones could be breaking up her relationship is the ultimate in gaslighting. Pregnancy hormones can do a lot of things, including making you depressed (I had severe PPD), but it doesnt make you responsible for tolerating the assholes in your life. I hope she dumps him post haste.",
            "You both sound very young. Suggest some grief counseling for you. NTA for letting him go. Please use birth control."

            "Oh hell no, do not slam cabinet doors or any other doors and disrespect me in the home I pay for. Buy your own damn food. I would go on strike. Id eat out to eat everyday. I would buy zero groceries. Order some noise canceling headphones. Let those 2 deal with it.",
            "This woman is literally being eaten out of house and home.",
            "Good lord, shes gotta be vitamin deficient with a diet like that. Nothing but salt, fat, and sugar. No wonder shes hungry all the time. \n\nDad needs to step up and take care of his kid if she has such special dietary considerations and is going to be hostile if theyre not taken care of.",
            "How is that 50/50 if she is buying all that food?",
            "Im perplexed why she let two other *adults* move in and agreed to a 50/50 split of all the bills in the first place. Then Im kind of appalled at the eating habits of Lindy. That seems like *a lot* of food - and mostly terrible food at that. What does Lindy spend her money on? I think Lindy buying her own food seems perfectly reasonable, especially since she only seems to eat three or four things - bread, peanut butter, and eggs.",
            "I went 50/50 with a roommate for a few months up until I realized she was spending upwards of 200-300 per week on her groceries while mine were more like $50 a week. She was also attempting to be frugal and save while doing it.\n\nI said we werent doing that anymore. She got mad. I went grocery shopping by myself and she was forced to go buy her own food.",
            "Why do people so desperate to not be alone that they will bankroll the most lame fathers? Is this man really not willing to pick up his daughters extra groceries to save his relationship? \n\nThe answer is no because hes a crap father with no gumption to help anyone but himself. You wouldnt have a bratty entitled 19yo without their crappy parent in the background",
            "Since his daughter is of age and working, in other words an adult with, I'm assuming her own bedroom (while you and her dad share a room) expenses should be split into thirds. Every adult pays 33% of rent, food, utilities and the same with chores. Everyone should do their own laundry too."

Started an affair with her and had all his kids go to her for counseling. She convinced them their mom was evil and the source of all the families problems. Before my friend even knew about the affair she moved in with the counselor (as a teen)!\n\nWe lost touch but my mom remained friends with hers so I dont know how my friend felt about things in the long run. But initially she told me about how nice this counselor was at her dads office and how they were becoming friends. Super creepy",
