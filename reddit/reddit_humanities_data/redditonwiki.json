            "Idc who it is, what their condition is, you abuse my dog after deliberately teasing them with food or a toy or whatever. I will give you a taste of your own medicine. Animals are the only innocent beings on this planet and this pregnant lady thought that just because she was pregnant that she could get away with kicking OOP\u2019s dog. She can\u2019t lose the baby if the belly isn\u2019t kicked in this scenario. Pregnancy isn\u2019t a justification to abuse anyone or anything",

            "Reading some of ops older posts, she has a history of having issues with pregnant people, and specifically says she's infertile and sad about it, and says for the reader to decide if that plays a part, and it really seems like OP just has unresolved issues with jealousy around pregnant women",
            "This is one of those stories where I feel like there\u2019s more to it but it was left out to make OP look good\u2026",
            "Both sides were wrong in this situation. I didn\u2019t care for that sister\u2019s comment to the OP either. The dog was the only one innocent here, lol",

            "OP comment:\n\n\"Sorry if I wasn't clear.\u00a0 There are no videos of my daughter except that one. My wife and I got her blackout curtains and told her about perverts a long time ago. She doesn't\u00a0 get nude in front of a window. He got arrested for that video alone. He is in a lot of shit.\u00a0\"",
            "I mean\u2026it sounds like the neighbor ruined his own life by not taking your concerns seriously. And tbh, good on the 14 year old for ruining his camera and proving he\u2019s a creep.",
            "People tend to tell on themselves.",
            "NTA. Neighbor could have been more responsive to your concerns.  Also, just means the cops only *found* that one recording\u2026",
            "Hahaha. Brilliant power move. How could neighbour know it was daughter unless daughter was on video.",
            "To me one of the damning aspects is that you can really only damage the camera if it hits directly on the sensor. In practice, this will mean that the camera and the laser are both pointed almost directly at each other.",
            "I let out a \"HA!\" reading this. OOP is NTA. The neighbor deserves all of the crap happening to him. OOP thought of a clever way to bust his neighbor, even though he may have not thought it at the time. Neighbor knew what he was doing with that camera.",
            "Nta, neighbors a weirdo and probably was watching her undress which is why they\u2019re fighting now. Called the cops just to reveal he\u2019s a creep.",
            "The cops saw the footage, but it took the OOP pointing out that his daughter was in her bra and underwear? Pretty sure the cops should have been alarmed by that all on their own.",
            "It sounds like you gave him a chance to correct the problem when you went and spoke to him. He lied to your face about where the camera was pointing and purposely did not let you see the feed because he knew it would show the camera pointing directly at your young daughter\u2019s window. I know you\u2019d like to believe that wasn\u2019t his intent, but I don\u2019t see any reason he would need that, even if it does include your fence line. Your neighbor also had the chance to change the angle after you spoke to him about your concerns but didn\u2019t. \n\n\nYou\u2019re NTA and neither is your daughter. Your neighbor is a creep."

            "This is going to end very badly.",
            "OOP letting his daughter have a lock, insisting on being paid for any babysitting, and standing firm on not giving her room away will help to avoid some of the major issues we see on other posts about blended families. We see so many posts about kids being forced to sacrifice too much for the sake of blending families, and they end up hating their parent and their new partner. \n\nI hope we get to see an update.",
            "Why does she need access to this girl's room so badly? I find it weird that being able to lock the door to her bedroom is some kind of slight to this woman.",
            "OP is TA for getting involved with this woman. She\u2019s a walking talking evil stepmom in the making and it would come hell or high water before I let someone move into my house and tell me what\u2019s fair.",

            "Absolutely not TA. Who does this woman think she is? I certainly wouldn\u2019t be marrying her. Your daughter has lost her mother and is open & willing to accept all these other children this new woman & a new sibling into her home ! Very mature of the daughter, if your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t respect the fact that you would put your kids ahead of everything then she is not the right one. If he could just up root his daughters life for a relationship would you not be worried he could do that to the kid you both share with someone else if it didn\u2019t work out??",
