        "content": "My cat suddenly got very weak over the last month. Not being able to jump high, not eating much, having bathroom problems. We took her to the vet almost every  two days for the last couple weeks.\nYesterday I heard her screaming at 5am outside(my dad let her out and she didn't want to come back in) I ran outside and she couldn't move. After putting her in her bed she calmed down. She still wasn't able to move basically at all.\n\nWe took her to a specialist and we where told she most likely has cancer and won't survive. The most humane thing to do was to put her to sleep. After about an hour of her being there I was told she has gotten worse and has very little chance of survival.\nI felt like I had to put her to sleep.\nWhen I saw her she had things like IV's on her and a mask helping her breath.\n\nAs they did it I saw she started to cry.\nAnd it's that. I know that what I did was the most reasonable thing. But I can't get the image of her eyes watering out of my head.\nI don't know what I'm expecting from this post. I just had to put this somewhere.\nI feel horrible everytime I think of her.",

            "If it helps, I did a quick google and cats don\u2019t cry tears for emotional reasons but because of medical ones. The best I can understand from what I read is it was related to her health issues. So it doesn\u2019t mean she was upset about what was happening or that you were wrong.",
            "I'm sorry for your loss. It's especially hard when it happens so suddenly... cats are so horribly good at hiding their illness.\u00a0\n\n\nIf it helps...\n\n\nVocalizations, running/ fighting, and tears are a common part of the euthanization process and don't signify any pain from the cat.\u00a0\n\n\nI think you're protecting your human experience onto her. As another poster said, cats don't cry because of emotions, their tears are purely a physical reaction. And that injection to her was the same as any other needle in her life,\u00a0 not any more significant or scary.\n\n\nIt was only scary to you who knew what was happening. But for her, she was sick and in pain, and then she wasn't.\u00a0\n\n\nWhenever you remember that moment, try to remember 3 good times with her as vividly as you can. We need to do that to overcome the inherent negativity bias in our brains.\u00a0",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. You absolutely did the hardest but kindest thing you could for your kitty. \n\nI also get you. I made the mistake of looking at my kitty Peanut when they gave her the shot, and it broke my heart. So I've learned: if you have to do this again* ask to hold your pet and close your eyes. Tell them you love them, and let your touch and voice be the last thing they experience.\n\n*I said after Peanut that she was the last cat I would have ... and then a month later, I was crying, \"I need a cat!\" My family adopted rescued kitten brothers off of Craiglist, and they were the best. It didn't mean I had forgotten Peanut -- it meant I loved cats and wanted them in my life.",
            "I am so sorry.  But I think cats eyes do not water quite the way humans do, so it wasn\u2019t the sadness/fear so much as illness.  \n\nYou did the right thing not making her suffer.  Try to take solace in that.",
            "I don't know if this will help but I will share my experience. My Kagemusha was eleven when I saw blood in his box. I took him to the vet and they called me to tell me he had a mass in his stomach. The vet said that he probably would not survive surgery and I finally came to the conclusion that it was better to let him go. \n\nI will always be grateful to the vet and their staff. I went down to the vet and they put me in a room where I could play with him for as long as I wished. In the past Kagi would be terrified to go to the vet and would often shit himself. But when I saw him he was alert and happy. He came up to me and I held him in my arms and we just spent about half an hour playing and cuddling. I felt like he was telling me that he knew what was happening and he was telling me it was right and ok. Finally I called the vet tech in and she gave me the option to leave or to be there. I chose to hold him in my arms. She gave him the shot and I just held him as he went. I was in tears. I held him for awhile and then handed him over to the tech. \n\nMy belief is that your cat knew that you were doing what was best and the crying was involuntary. I am sorry for your loss. You did right.",

            "I would guess that was related to her health. Kitties show their distress differently than us. My girl has cancer right now, one of her side effects at the moment is that her eye tears up due to where it is located, but this isn\u2019t related to pain itself.",
            "All the strength in the world to you. As others have said it\u2019s normal for this to happen during the process, and doesn\u2019t indicate emotion. \n\nYou did what was best for your kitty, try and take comfort in that if you can",
            "You did what was best for her. You saved her from the pain. Going through this is very difficult, saying goodbye so suddenly. She was in pain and I don\u2019t think cats can cry like humans do, I don\u2019t think they cry when feeling sad. It was probably her body malfunctioning.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure she loved you and she knows you did it to help her. No one wants to suffer.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you had to experience this, may she rest in peace and you take care \ud83e\udec2"

I didn't replace him.  The kittens aren't him.  But I had a house full of cat furniture/toys ... I have food in the cupboard and LOVE in my heart for cats.  I am honoring him by helping his little furry bretheren, giving them a safe life full of love.  Why would my little soul fur-baby be mad at me for that?  Would he want me to be lonely and sad?\n\nThere are shelters all over the world that are bursting at the seams with cats that need homes.  You gave your previous pets a great home ... do the same for others.  Don't let the love die with them.",

I don\u2019t always do rescues/ shelters either, far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s a good chance people giving away/ selling pets locally (that aren\u2019t breeders, I don\u2019t buy from them directly) will eventually have their pets ending up in a shelter/ on the street anyway. It\u2019s all the same to me, get them all fixed after I move them in.

            "Please don\u2019t feel guilty.  You gave your babies a good, long life and can do that for more kitties.  I lost my 21, 20 and 17 year old cats and said the same thing. No more; it\u2019s too hard to lose them. Well, 3 kitty sisters were born in my backyard and I fell in love.  13 years later with no regrets.",
            "Someone once told me that when you lose a cat the silver lining is that it makes space in your life to give another cat a loving home. Your babies aren't feeling sad that you've replaced them, they're probably proud that another new little guy gets to enjoy your love",
            "Grief is a long and different process for each person, the situation you are in is quite painful and it is okay to feel everything you feel. Perhaps you feel that making room for a new kitten is taking away the place of the previous ones and in no case is that possible. You don't need to preserve your sadness to honor them, because they would be happy to see you smile again, that's for sure. Maybe it helps to make something that makes sense to you, like an altar or a small corner un your house where you can remember your beloved kittens, and thus deal with that feeling of guilt a little.

I also talked to a friend who owns two cats that she adopted years after each other, and she provided some really good insight too. I\u2019m absolutely going to do my best to keep her, because tbh I\u2019ve never loved anything enough to wake up in the morning and wipe their butthole before haha! My main focus will be getting the kitten and dog used to each other asap, and I\u2019ll be letting her sleep in my room! Thank you guys sm!!**\n\nMonday I adopted a 10wk/2.5 month old kitten. I love her. She\u2019s incredibly sweet and absolutely adorable. Im back home from college so ima how to spend most of my day with her, from around 10 am to 10 pm she\u2019s with me nonstop unless my mom or my brother feel like playing with her. At ten, I put her in her safe zone in the bathroom with a litter box, toys, food and water for the night. When I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is check up on her and wipe her butt bc she was taken from her mom a little too early and struggles with having a few crumbs there. \n\nThere\u2019s just 2 problems. \n\n1. My family has a dog. We\u2019ve had her for 5 years now, going on 6. The dog is super curious about the cat, and constantly wants to go where the cat is and begs to see her. However, the Kitten absolutely hates her. I never have them running around at the same time because I\u2019ve read up on her about introductions and it being a gradual process. But, now I either have to deal with the cat meowing because it\u2019s wants to run around or the dog whining because she doesn\u2019t get as much free reign of the house as she used to. \n\n2. I keep having this looming feeling that I made a mistake by adopting her. At night when I put her away im immediately combated by thoughts that I\u2019ve made a mistake, that I can\u2019t care for her, and that she should not be here. I only have these thoughts when im not with her. Im a person who really struggles with depression and mental illness, and before I got her I spent most of my summer sleeping and unable to leave my bed. My family and I don\u2019t always get along, so I never really interacted with them either. I spent all my time alone and/or playing the sims in bed. Now, I have an obligation to fulfill and barely spend any time alone.\n\nMy parents are giving me  2 week period/ trial run to adjust. \n\nWhat should I do?? Should I give her back? Getting another kitten is not an option for me at the moment. Support, advice, or anything of the sort would be highly appreciated. \n\n\n\n",

I would concentrate on getting  the dog and cat used to each other... they could become buddies, and that will expand the kitten's world. You sound like you are feeling pressure... having a new pet does come with some stress, but it should lessen as the kitten grows, especially if the dog and kitten become buds. Try to relax a bit. Of course, if you continue to feel overwhelmed, think about returning or rehoming the kitty. Maybe just give it a few more weeks or a couple of months and see how you feel then.",
            "Sometimes it takes a while to settle in and get used to a new animal, especially a baby animal that requires more care. The kitten has probably never experienced a dog before and needs some time to get used to her, and it sounds like the dog isn\u2019t a danger to her at all- I\u2019m sure they will become buddies in no time. Give it a few weeks and see how you feel, but it sounds like the kitten is in great hands",
            "i mean honestly? i felt similar when i adopted my cat when she was 3 months old and i was a freshman in college. i was so nervous that i couldn't be able to give her what she needed, with being a full time student and also having mental health struggles. for my cant get out of bed or too busy on campus to come home days, i find an automatic feeder and water fountain extremely helpful. as she gets older she will get more independent and adjusted to your routine, my girl is 2 now and is very supportive when im struggling. definitely takes time for both of you to adjust, im sending all my love <3",

            "This is not an accurate reflection of what it's like to live with a cat.\n\n\n1 - you're in transition. You, the kitten, the dog, everybody. Lots to get used to, lots of extra stress\n\n\n2 - it's a kitten, has high needs, and without other kittens to play with will become bored quickly (even destructive). This puts a lot more burden on you compared to 2 kittens or an adult cat\n\n\nGive yourself a few weeks to get out of the transition and see how you feel.\u00a0\n\n\nI was debiltatingly depressed and anxious when I got my first cat.

I play with her and she can sleep in my bedroom if she wants to (she sleeps under the bed). I do worry about single kitten syndrome etc but I am doing my best and I am not going to stress myself out because a relaxed owner is better for pets. \n\nYour kitten will be ok, if possible let her sleep in your room and introduce her slowly to your dog.

He was in pain by the third day, and I wished we had euthanized sooner.\n\nAs a cancer survivor, I have had pleural effusions myself, and it feels like not being able to catch a breath. I knew what my cat was feeling.\n\nYour cat was suffering, and you did the right thing!!!\u00a0",

They do not know today or tomorrow, they don\u2019t look forward to another day like we do. All they know is what\u2019s here and now. If her quality of life was diminished greatly then you gave her a great kindness by ending her pain.",
            "I went through this earlier this year. My girl was struggling to breathe in late January, the vet said her lungs were full of fluid and said I could not take her home, that we had to intervene. The vet suggested euthanasia right away but since I'd come in there suspecting something like asthma, I was not prepared for news like that. My cat was only 11. I opted for further diagnosis and she was determined to have heart failure. She stayed overnight and I took her home with medication the following day. To make a long story shorter, she was on twice daily meds, weekly vet visits and it was a daily rollercoaster for me and her. Some days were good and others I was an anxious wreck, constantly worrying about whether she could breathe. After 2 months she stopped eating all together and I had to let her go. So to your experience, the right answer isn't always doing more. It could've been equally as hard to watch daily struggle like I did and to the person who suggested it could've been caught earlier, I asked my vet the same question and beat myself up over how I didn't know. The vet simply stated that even vets aren't catching heart disease and cats are very good at hiding their pain. Allow yourself to grieve and miss your kitty. I'm sure you did the best you could.",

            "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. Making that decision is so hard. I made a very similar decision back in December. My sweet baby girl was likely dying of heart and kidney failure and had fluid built up on her lungs. My vet said the most humane option was to let her go, that she was so old already it would just torture for her. And I agreed. We cried as she did it and she told me she would have chosen the same route for her animals. It\u2019s never going to be easy, but you took her pain away and are carrying it yourself now. Which is a selfless thing to do. She\u2019s bouncing around across the rainbow bridge waiting for you, free and happy and not in pain. I hope you find some peace soon, much love to you \ud83d\udda4",
            "I just had to make this decision Monday for my 8 year old cat. It boiled down to 2 of the three options were for my benefit alone, only 1 was for his benefit and that was euthanasia. And I just keep telling myself that. It was one battle he wasn't coming back from, and that's OK. The guilt will linger, especially when surgery is offered, but you have to decide what's more important quality or quantity?",
            "Such a beautiful little baby. God bless you for the years of love you had"
