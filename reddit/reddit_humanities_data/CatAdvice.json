Immediately FREAKED given I know how toxic they are. Checked the lilies, one clearly had her bite mark in it. Brought her to ER vet very quickly, sobbed the whole time thinking I would lose her, but they treated her promptly and now we\u2019re just making sure her kidneys are working OK the next few days. But 0 symptoms besides being stressed from the ordeal. My dad also feels really bad and was shocked to learn true lilies are so toxic to cats (even though I have told him exactly that multiple times lmao). \n\nI just feel so upset still? Even though she\u2019ll be fine? it was an awful scare. Like What if I hadn\u2019t noticed, or she got into something none of us knew was toxic to her? How do you handle loving something so much while knowing some awful accident could take them away from you so quickly? I feel really guilty even though I didn\u2019t buy the lilies. How do you emotionally cope with health scares like this :( ",

Ive told my family numerous times how dangerous they are for cats, and everyone still buys them for my mom, and she also wont discourage anyone from buying them for her. I just have my cat trained not to go anywhere near where the lilys are, I also spray lemon air freshener on them when they come in the house, and make sure to keep a closer eye on where she is when I know theres some around.",

Now Im a frickin helicopter parent to her and just making myself sick with worry for her health. Its like damn, is she breathing right? Like I seriously obsess like that. It sucks. Ive had cat my whole life but like Ive never felt this protective and worried over a kitty before. I dont have any advice because Im barely coping myself. Ive resigned myself to loving her so so so much and making sure shes happy and healthy for as long as I am blessed with her.",

            "i would be totally freaking out in your situation too, thats so scary! im so glad your babys doing ok! this was absolutely not your fault. it sucks that your family didnt take you seriously but you did everything you could, and you got your cat medical attention right away. sending virtual hugs for you and your kitty!!",
            "You've handled it perfectly. During the emergency, you COULD NOT PANIC. You had to keep it together enough to crate your baby, drive to the vet, talk to doctor, etc. Now, in the aftermath, it's safe for you to break down. Be kind to yourself. Make some tea, put on your fuzzy socks, and give yourself the space to process the thoughts and emotions you shoved down earlier. Also, tell your cat she's ridiculous and I love her. ",
            "My cat is obsessed with plants! I put a table outside the window, and any flowers I receive get put out there so I can see them while keeping the cat safe. Last time he sat at the window with his paw against it, and meowed at them! I cant risk bringing anything into the house",
            "I had a kitty die from eating a Lily. I had no idea until then. I don't bring any flowers with lilies into my house anymore. I was sent a bouquet with lilies and I put it on my porch."

I thought it was going to take a week max, but it ended up being 2.5 months. I initially visited him all the time but as the illness progressed, I didnt know if Id have much time with my sick boy so I stayed home. We ended up finding the issue and started treatment. The disease was not contagious but I kept the other cat away to give my sick boy peace and alone time to recover.
