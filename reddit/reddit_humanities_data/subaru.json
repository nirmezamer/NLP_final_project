        "content": "Hello r/subaru,\n\nWe've been seeing a big influx of questions about CVT fluids lately, with an average of 1-2 threads per day for about the past month. So, I've decided to make one consolidated thread about it. Future question posts about CVT fluid will be deferred to this thread. In response, I want to get as much information as possible into a single place, so users like yourself can make as informed of a choice as possible.\n\n------\n\n#What is a CVT?\n\nLet's start with the basics here. The Continuously-Variable Transmission, or CVT, does not work the same way as a \"conventional\" automatic transmission which you may have been used to previously. So let's start our journey with a conventional auto trans.\n\nIn an automatic transmission, there are a series of planetary gearsets. These gearsets will be surrounded by a number of hydraulically-actuated clutches. The hydraulic fluid inside of the clutches are controlled by the transmission computer, through a mechanism of valves that are controlled by solenoids. The solenoids and valves all exist in a component known as a \"valve body.\" As the TCM commands certain valves to open or close, different clutches will be engaged which subsequently will control elements of the planetary gearsets. This is how your conventional automatic transmission achieves changing gear ratios.\n\nIn a CVT, by contrast, the gear ratio mechanism is a set of cone-shaped sheaves or \"variators\" with a belt (or in Subaru's case, chain) run between them. Instead of the valve body controlling clutch packs, it instead varies the fluid pressure inside of both sheaves, such that the cone surfaces can get closer together or further apart. Because the thickness of the chain doesn't change, by opening the sheaves, the chain will ride down lower into the cone shapes, thus being on a smaller diameter. Because the chain doesn't change length either, there needs to be a corresponding change to the opposite change to get closer together to make the chain ride on a larger-diameter part of the sheave. Thus, the transmission computer achieves different gearing ratios by adjusting the gap of both sheaves in tandem. If you're having trouble visualizing this, [here is a good animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEq5_b4LWNY) explaining the motion.\n\nBefore someone interjects, yes there are clutch sets inside of a CVT as well. Specifically in a Subaru transmission, there are 3 relevant ones; there is a planetary set inside the powerflow for your Drive or Reverse functionality; there is a Lock-Up clutch inside the torque converter, and in most cases there is a Multi-Plate Transfer clutch for your all-wheel drive \"center differential\" function. These functions are more-or-less identical to their equivalent components in a conventional automatic transmission.\n\n#OK but what about the fluid?\n\nThere are quite a few differences between CVT fluid and conventional ATF. Part of these differences are how the fluid is used in the transmission, and part of the difference is because of what the transmission does to the fluid.\n\nIn a conventional transmission, you have many clutch packs actuating whenever the car is changing gear ratios. Just like in a manual transmission clutch, or like your brake pads, every time there is slip between the clutch material and the friction surface, a little bit of that clutch material will wear off. In a conventional transmission, this means that over time, that clutch material will begin to accumulate in the fluid, which gives it a burnt smell and a brown tinge. By contrast, a CVT does not use as many clutches inside of it, and as such, clutch material contamination is drastically reduced inside of the CVT fluid.\n\nAnother main difference has to do with the fluid pressure inside of the transmission. While a conventional auto only needs fluid pressures around 150-250 PSI to operate the clutch packs, a CVT requires much higher line pressures of 650-850 PSI in order to keep enough \"squeeze\" force on the sheaves to hold the chain. The CVT fluid also functions as a friction modifier between the chain and sheave, wherein it helps the chain \"grip\" on the otherwise-smooth pulley surface. Because of this, CVT fluid is very specific about its chemical properties and should not be substituted for any other fluids.\n\n\n#So... should I service the fluid?\n\nLet's start this by looking back at what a conventional automatic transmission requirement would be. [Here is the service manual schedule from a 2010 Forester.](https://imgur.com/o15NYKr) I've highlighted ATF for you, but basically it only says \"Inspect [and replace as necessary] every 30k miles.\" Okay, but what does it mean by Inspect? The service manual has [this inspection procedure](https://imgur.com/ndrdp6T) for checking the level. It also has [this condition table](https://imgur.com/ZTk88cO) listed for what to do when you find a condition-based failure. I've highlighted the \"thick and varnish\" section because this would be the clutch wear condition I described above. *Generally speaking,* your average Subaru 4EAT or 5EAT will have noticeable signs of discoloration every ~60k miles.\n\nSo what does Subaru say about CVT fluid then? Well for comparison, let's look at a 2018 Forester service manual. [Here is the service schedule,](https://imgur.com/dC5EmY2) which  you can see has an identical \"Inspect [and replace as necessary]\" every 30k miles. As for an inspection process, it only offers [this inspection procedure](https://imgur.com/pC3RDem) and [the same condition table](https://imgur.com/WN4EyoS) as before. \n\nBecause the schedule and condition checks are basically the same for both service manuals, it would be very easy to assume the fluids needs the same replacement schedule -- and I strongly suspect this is the driving force behind so many CVT fluid recommendations. However, if we read this again, remember that we only need to address the fluid *if if fails one of the condition checks*, and that the most common failure condition in a conventional automatic transmission largely no longer happens in a CVT. It is because of this that your Owner's Manual probably describes the transmission fluid as a \"lifetime fluid.\"\n\n#What about what other countries say?\n\nA claim I very often see made in threads about CVT fluid is that \"Country XYZ requires fluid changes every X miles!\" I want to nip this in the bud now, because it's not true. Now because I work in the US, I cannot access foreign service manuals, but I can get ahold of owner's manuals, so here are a few examples:\n\n[here's a UK 2018 forester owner's manual](https://imgur.com/xkJgOkz) ([link](https://subarucore.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12140046/Forester-2018-Owners-manual-1.pdf))\n\n[Here's a n Australian 2020 forester/XV schedule.](https://imgur.com/iFkSian) Subaru Australiia [has .pdf copies here of warranty booklets.](https://www.subaru.com.au/owners/warranty).\n\n[here's a Japan 2018 forester's owner's manual](https://imgur.com/dgpDL2P) ([link](https://www.subaru.jp/afterservice/tnst/forester/pdf/A8230JJ-G.pdf?downLoaditemRadio=&downLoaditemRadio=pdf%2FA8230JJ-G.pdf)) and it says in the bottom row there: \u4ea4\u63db\u6642\u671f  | \u7121\u4ea4\u63db which translates as Replacement time | No replacement\n\nHere is a 2020 WRX owner's manual from Japan, straight off Subaru.jp: https://www.subaru.jp/afterservice/tnst/wrx/pdf/A1760JJ-A.pdf\n\n[pg. 465 is the service information for transmission/differential/etc gear oils.](https://imgur.com/hwlL95X) The 3rd section is for CVT fluid:\n\n>\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\n\n> \u4f7f\u7528\u30aa\u30a4\u30eb \u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u30afCVT\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9 \u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u7528\n\n> \u898f\u5b9a\u91cf \u7d0412.4L\n\n>\u4ea4\u63db\u6642\u671f \u7121\u4ea4\u63db\n\nTranslated:\n\n>Transmission Fluid\n\n>Used oil Subaru high torque CVT fluid\nfor Lineartronic\n\n>Prescribed amount about 12.4L\n\n>[**Replacement time No replacement**](https://imgur.com/e8162c1)\n\nThe only subaru branch AFAIK that [does list a required CVT fluid interval](https://imgur.com/OMfHvgm) is Canada, ([soruce](https://www.subaru.ca/WebPage.aspx?WebSiteID=282&WebPageID=18541)) where if I'm being honest the way it's written in their maintenance guide makes it seem like they just never changed it from ATF-era cars, where Canada also listed replacement as necessary every 100k km. (It only refers to \"transmission oil\" and does not specifically mention CVT fluid, but everywhere else differentiates the two. It also does not differentiate manual vs. automatic transmission fluid, like everyone else does.) There, it's listed as a 100k km service item.\n\n#that didn't answer the question though.\n\nYou're right, I didn't. The long answer is that you should have your fluid inspected by a technician familiar with Subaru CVTs, and if deemed necessary, you should replace the fluid with genuine Subaru fluid as required by your particular model. If following the conventional wisdom from ATF-era cars also makes you feel more comfortable, then defer to Canada's schedule and plan to perform a fluid service at your 100k km (60k miles) service.\n\n#A quick note about \"Severe Usage Schedule\"\n\nAnother common discussion point I see brought up is the Severe Usage schedule. I largely blame the confusion for this on Subaru, who have written this in a hard-to-understand way in the owner's manuals. However, a 2010-2014 Legacy/Outback service manual [has the best representation of the severe usage shceudle.](https://imgur.com/lJHNnJk) As you can see, the only time Severe applies to your CVTF is if you \"repeatedly tow\" with the vehicle. This guidance has not changed with newer cars, however the new way it's written [is confusing to read.](https://imgur.com/Sc4o1lw)  (CVT fluid is maintenance item 12; see above where it shows this as Note 4.)\n\n#A last quick note on Differential Fluid\n\nJust want to quickly touch on this one. Your Subaru has separate, distinct fluid for the front differential. While you can see from the above service schedule that the guidance for its fluid is functionally the same, differential oil gets contaminated in a completely different way. Because a differential is basically all metal-on-metal wear of gear teeth, especially after break-in your fluid will get dark and metallic very rapidly. This is normal. [Here's my personal Crosstrek at 19k miles.](https://youtu.be/etBBiMih10I) **In my own personal experience,** I would recommend replacing your gear oils at 30k miles, but the fluid condition will stay good for longer after the initial change, such that it can go every 60k thereafter.\n\n#On fluid changes and failures.\n\nI just want to quick touch on ways that we see CVT failures at the dealer and how it relates to fluid. By far the most common issue we'll run across, is from the \"small\" CVT, the TR580, which is paired with any of the 2.0L or 2.5L naturally-aspirated engines. Typically somewhere in the 100-150k mile range, a failure in the valve body, usually for the Torque Converter Lockup Duty solenoid, is relatively common. This is a failure in the electronics side of the solenoid, and thus has no relation to the CVT fluid; as such, changing or not changing the fluid has no real bearing on the likelihood of this failure occuring. The second issue we see, the most terminal one, is called Chain Slip. [Here, at 0:23, is a fantastic example of severe chain slip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyYbt1Zt1H0) Chain Slip can develop from a variety of causes, but generally is the result of a lack of fluid pressure squeezing the sheaves against the chain; when this happens, the chain essentially does a burnout on the sheaves. This leaves a wear groove in the sheave face, and makes chain slip much more likely to occur whenever the same gear ratio is used. There are some conditions of fluid degradation that can increase the risk of slip; these largely result from fluid overheating, which degrades the additives that help provide friction between the sheaves and chain.\n\n-------\n\nHopefully there is enough info in here for you to decide for yourself if or when you would like to change your fluid.

            "Thanks for this resource. What are the symptoms of a solenoid failure vs slip failure?",
            "Very thorough breakdown, thanks for taking the time. \n\nIn my opinion, as well as other master techs that I've worked with, it's a good idea to drain/fill your CVT fluid around 75-80k miles. I did my 2017 Outback 2.5i at 74k and sent it out to Blackstone, it came back with zero issues. What are your opinions on a drain/fill as a preventative service?",
            "Much appreciation, clarity but with nuance is a wonderful thing the internet.",
            "Great info, thanks for putting all that together. I've been wondering if I should get my CVt fluid changed on a '17 XT with 55k miles. The dealer didn't recommend it but ended up giving me a $400 service estimate. \n\nI had a leaking transmission pan gasket they replaced a year ago - how much fluid would have been lost for that? The service records didn't indicate replacement fluid.",
            "Excellent write up as usual.",
            "Thanks for putting this together. I recently did a drain and fill for the first time at 130k miles. I notice a significant improvement in how smooth the transmission shifts now. Previously, I would notice lag at times, and symptoms similar to what you described as chain slip. Those are gone. So, I\u2019m happy that I did it.",
            "Planning to change myself at 70k....\n\nAny special procedures? Other than draining and filling the correct hole?",
            "Thank you for this. Great writeup. \n\nI just had my '23 Outback Wilderness CVT fluid changed at 23k miles because I was trying to be super cautious.  Looks like I can wait a while for the next one!",
            "Ok, let's say, asking for a friend, their CVT failed on their '16 Outback due to the lockup solenoid and it was replaced under the extended warranty, but the installation of the remanned transmission caused a leak somewhere around the rear of the trans and put off taking it back well beyond a reasonable time in which the dealership would give me the time of day to fix it under any kind of parts or workmanship warranty. \n\nI'm more experienced with cars than your average human...I mean my friend is..., but CVTs are foreign. Is topping it off something to even consider as a DIY, or just pay for a drain and fill once a year or so? No way I'm paying for it to get removed and re-sealed, it's almost 10 years old with well over 100k miles and is going off to college next year.",
            "148k in my 2016 Legacy, CVT fluid has never been changed to my knowledge.... Is it going to explode?"

            "Absolutely nobody that cares about their car.",
            "I found that oil kinda crap for my ej205 if you don't wanna splurge on motul check out valvoline advanced, can get for cheap/on sale and had much better results",
            "If i did my Km to US miles conversion correctly then I do change oil every 6213 miles. (10 000 km metric system which is 1000 miles in europe / sweden.) I am very picky over not going over 6213 miles with both my Subarus.",
            "I'd be interested to see the numbers, I had a garage oil change at about 7k on a car (Vauxhall/Opel) not long ago and they said they'd do it but it'd be a waste of money.\n\nMost of the non US markets seem to recommend far higher mileage (or kilometre-age?) oil changes. \n\nLet me check my Scooby manual to see what the recommendations are.",
            "On my 2007 Matrix, if I get the 10k oil.. I do 8000 miles.\nIf I get the 20k oil, I may push it to 12,000 miles.\n\nSo far so good!  I replaced the valve cover gasket (the car was built in 06, it's 18 years old), and it looks spotless. It also burns zero oil between changes.\nTo be fair, it's all highway miles cruising at 80-95mph, very rarely do I step into the city. \n\n\nMy STI obviously does 5k MAX, with rotella, also doesn't burn oil.",

            "That's so detailed. I'm impressed!",
            "I am reading up on the Restore & Protect formula. It is supposed to 100% clean by at least 4 oil changes.\n\nMight want to check your local Walmart for either one. They appear to have the best 5qt oil prices.",
            "I\u2019d love to splurge on oem oil but my ej253 leaks oil so I kind of find it a waste at $34.99gal at my local Subaru dealer. I\u2019ve been using the Valvoline restore and protect and after about 6 oil changes I\u2019ll get their HighMileage+ formula."
