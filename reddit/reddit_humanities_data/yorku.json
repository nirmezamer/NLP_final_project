        "content": "In the past year or two, I've never failed to get into any full class that I wanted to get into.  Here's my advice on how to get into full classes.\n\n# Keep trying\n\nNote down all the catalog numbers for all the courses you want in one single text file on your computer.  Keep trying to get in.  Initially, trying once or twice a week would be reasonable.  In the first week of class, it's best to try at least once a day, if not more.\n\n# You might not succeed until the first week or two of the term\n\nThe easiest time to get into any course is probably very early or very late.\n\nVery early means as soon as your enrollment window opens.\n\nVery late means on or after the first day of classes.  During the term, the best time to get into a class might be during the first or second lecture, or in the few hours after the lecture.  That's when a lot of students decide they hate a class and end up dropping it.\n\nIf all that fails, you may be able to enrol extra-late with instructor permission.  I think the period for this might be in the third or fourth week of September.\n\n# Go to every lecture, and take notes\n\nIt might be wise to go to every lecture and take notes, even if you haven't gotten into the class yet.  Try to think of at least one question in each course, and ask it during or after lecture.  This will help the instructor to get to know your face.\n\nWhen trying to get the instructor's permission to enrol extra-late, tell them how lectures you've attended so far.\n\n# If the lecture hall is overfilled, it's best not to stay\n\nIf you're not enrolled in the class, and the lecture hall is completely full, and there are people sitting on the steps:  It'd probably be best to leave, and to try coming back again next week.  It's probably not the safest thing for people to sit on the steps.  [(Source.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/19dc9ly/students_sitting_on_steps_of_lecture_hall_early/)  If you also sit on the steps, this just adds to the situation.\n\nInstead of listening to the lecture, you could read the readings for the week.  The course outline will probably tell you what the readings are.  After class, you can go back to the lecture hall and get a copy of the course outline from anyone in the room.  Or you can email the professor and politely request it.  The [York library](https://www.library.yorku.ca/) owns a lot of textbooks which you can borrow.\n\n# If this is your final semester\n\nIf you want to apply to graduate this semester, and you're trying to get into a required course, I'm not sure what to do.  Maybe someone will comment below.\n\n# If the class is full, do not bother the prof\n\nIf a course is full, do not bother the instructor for an override unless the department told you to do so.  You get overrides from the department, not from the instructor.\n\n# Don't give up hope\n\n/u/DrParapraxis is a prof, and wrote [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/3efx8d/getting_into_courses_that_are_already_full/ctjsye3/):\n\n\"Maybe it differs by department, but in mine I have zero power to let people in over the cap; it's all up to the undergraduate office. That said, it's always the case that enough people drop so anyone who wants in has gotten in.\"\n\n# If all else fails, you can work part-time\n\nIn the very unlikely event that none of the above tips work, you might find yourself with some extra free time on your hands.  If this ends up happening, you can work part-time, on or off campus, and do school part time.  So, you can still have a fully productive year.\n\nLots of jobs on campus (e.g. at the library and at some other departments) are restricted to students only, even if it doesn't say so in the job posting.\n\nIf you want to work for York itself, see [York's job postings](https://jobs-ca.technomedia.com/yorkuniversity/).  Check off all the affiliations you're interested in.  Some of the affiliations (e.g. \"YUSA 2 PT\" and \"Summer Student\") are good choices for students.  \"Work Study\" and \"LEAP\" are also good, if you're [eligible](https://sfs.yorku.ca/work-study-programs).\n\nIf you want to work at a restaurant or some other place on campus which is not owned and run by York itself, go there and ask them how to apply.",
