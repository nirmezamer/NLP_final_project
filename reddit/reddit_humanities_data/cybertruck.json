        "content": "Plan on wrapping my CT with a black wrap. Got a few estimates ( Vinyl $3,500 / PPF $6,500) but I come across the same problem.  No installer wants to tuck the PPF at the edges. They only go against it  and shave down for adhersion due to thickness and sharp corners of the CT. Vinyl does but no one recommends hi gloss vinyl. I want hi gloss black \nThe options I get are \nPPF hi gloss with shaved edges or vinyl satin black with tucked edges.  I\u2019m attaching pics of other trucks for reference. . I can slightly see the edges of PPF which will drive me nuts I feel. Vinyl is not shiny enough imo. Do I compromise and do vinyl? ",

            "Given the lack of durability on vinyl, I wouldn't do it. The front is going to be hammered and it doesn't last nearly as long as ppf. Installers can tuck the edges. Plenty of examples on yt. \n\nCheck the Tesla wraps, they are ppf. I'm not sure if they are tucking the edges, but if they are, the cost is close to your estimates.",
            "Really liking the gloss black",
            "I have ppf on mine same issue, you can see borders slightly. I agree can drive you nuts, because it did to me at beginning. Only caveat is that my color it\u2019s gloss black with sparkles so during day with sun becomes grayish, gun metal like and blends the borders, so it looks like if it is part of it, but with no sunlight yes you can see the steel edge \u2026\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.   I agree I wouldn\u2019t go with vinyl unless you thinking on changing it in 3 years or so\u2026",
            "I see that some installers cover the edges with PPF. So it s doable. What\u2019s the problem? Is that it won\u2019t stick well on the edges? Even if adhesive promoter is applied? Please advise. I m planning to DIY mine on PPF this weekend and I was planing to cover the edges even would be much easier not covering edges",
            "The place the wrapped my truck in SoCal didn't do the corners but it was their first CT. I've seen their other CTs and they are wrapped around. Just a heads up, the edges especially the rear fenders by the tailgate are sharp. So if anything like charge cords rub against them, they'll cut the film. \nI didn't vinyl because it was cheaper, there is no paint to protect and I'm going to change the color in a couple 3 years or so anyway. \nThe new 3M 2080 films have been doing pretty good when it comes to field test so as long as long you somewhat take care of it, it'll last a long time. You can check my profile for pics of my truck.",
            "Batman to darth vader.",
            "So the new update is that Tesla recommended a place that they use.  Turns out that they don\u2019t use PPF or vinyl. They are going with AUTO FLEX BY (Clarity Coat). Apparently it\u2019s way better than PPF and the liquid covers all corners. I might have found my choice.  Anyone know a thing or 2 about this?  The owner said to come and check out the CT he owns to see.  He swears by this product. Said both PPP and Vinyl look like shit.",
            "I went with satin PPF and love it. AudioToyz in Orange County did it.",
            " I have a quote for full vinyl gloss wrap and PPF on top of the vinyl in the front (full hood, fenders, front bumper panel, and headlight.).  Seems a bit high.   $5500 for full vinyl and PPF on top for an additional $2600.    Is putting PPF on top not the norm?   The PPF is listed as Suntek PPF Reaction.    The vinyl is an   Avery Dennison color flip gloss.",
