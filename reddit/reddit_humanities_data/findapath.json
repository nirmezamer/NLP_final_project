        "content": "I've removed a lot of trolls and a lot of posts that were not constructive or helpful and I've realized some people still haven't quiiiiiite gotten with the new rules yet - which of course is fine because the rules are generic on purpose. So this is about the concept of tough love....and the clear difference between the two.\n\n**\"Disguised Hate/False Tough Love\"**\n\nExample that came directly from someone here:  \n\"Stop trying to get random people online to feel bad for you. Study harder, go to the gym, go for a walk, put your phone down, learn a new skill. Get some help man. Your life is pathetic because you\u2019re letting it be. Grow some fucking balls and improve your life and get your degree. Good things come to those who go out and earn it. Your attitude is not attractive.\"\n\n**\"Tough Love\"** (acceptable to this group so you won't be flagged for being a dick or offering nonconstructive advice)\n\n\"From what it sounds like, you're creating your own issue here, my man. It's like you are intending to take yourself down and do it in the most self-destructive way possible. For example, you are letting your grades slip because you're sad about your girlfriend. These two things are mutually exclusive, you do not need to let this happen but you are letting it because it's easy to justify. You are also stopping going to the gym...why? You can be sad about your girlfriend sure, but you don't NEED to stop doing the other things that are beneficial to your health and future! Take a long, hard look at your behaviors and start recognizing where you're letting yourself spiral.\"\n\nWhen you are posting in this group, note your feelings. Are you feeling hot-headed anger towards the original poster for wasting an opportunity you would have loved, or being an age where you were doing better than them at that age, or angry at the original poster for thinking something wrong? **Check. Your. Anger. First. Don't post while fuming.** Your anger is not a welcome guest in this sub! Come back when you're cooled down and more level headed, and use the opportunity to note you may have some inner work yourself!\n\nTL:DR: False Tough Love = Judgement. It's insult, not insight. \n\nAs long as your posts are constructive, positive, actionable, you are fine!",

            "Thank you for this. Tough love is about saying some hard truths that are constructive. Hurling insults at someone doesn't help them. So many bring their preconceived prejudices to the table. They assume that an OP is coming from a place of laziness and wanting to be handed something.",

When I listen to feedback with an open mind, I can differentiate between someone coaching me through one of my blindspots vs someone tearing me down in a subtle way.\n\nAlways good for me to be aware as well!

        "score": 31,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1cwwnod/suicide_posts/",
        "content": "First I just need to say thank you for all the reports on the many, MANY suicide posts that have come through lately. I've had so many \"2: Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm\" reports come through my feed in the last few days/week.\n\nI want you to know exactly what happens when I get those reports....and you're not going to like this. Please read every word of this LONG post! *TL:DR at the bottom.*\n\nI ignore them. As in press the Ignore button.\n\n**WHY?**\n\nTwo reasons. 1. People are hurting here and I've allowed those posts because this group has always been open to anyone with any issue within the \"finding a path\" idea. 2. I'm not a therapist nor a superhero. I cannot go fly in to save them from their own mental health, swoosh their life to better, and leave them feeling all the sunshine and rainbows!\n\nHowever, if the post is definitely an \"announcing my suicide with no wish to find a path out of it\"....I report the name to Reddit to step in, as there is a new partnership with the Crisis Hotline. Do I do this with every single post that mentions suicide at the end but otherwise states their issues and wants help out of it in some way? Nope. They are allowed to be that low. Without being reported to the Crisis Hotline for it.\n\nThere's nothing else I can do for the person professionally. There's nothing more WE can do more for them. We're here to help people find a path, or even a way out of their pain, and as long as we are leaving supportive, helpful, kind, and actionable comments....*that's all we can do.* We are nothing more than pointers, we are not therapists or situation-changers for people, but what we are doing is decently life-changing for an online forum and hopefully a bit of life-saving.\n\nSome people are simply too low to help and our job can only be to point them to the extreme therapy they need, via resources and links if possible.\n\n**These posts are depressing though!**  \nYes, they are, and I too can only handle so much of them. After clearing the feed, I basically can do 2 posts of helping/actionable comments a day!\n\nAnd the easy path is me just making a rule that says a nasty quip like \"this isn't an airport, you don't need to announce your suicide\" and set Automoderator to remove all posts that say the words we no longer want to hear. Removing all the not fully serious ones too, because I can't code Automod with AI ability. Cementing to people that they are not welcome and should go through with the act, convincing people that they can't even get help when they reach out as a last ditch attempt.\n\nIs that who we are? Should we truly go that way?  \nShould we niche down (bubble) to become exactly like r/careerchange?  \nCast out those in the most need, because we don't like seeing the negativity?\n\nIf they can't come to this group for hope....then where should they go?\n\nYour ideas on this are very welcome.\n\n**Your mental health is important too.**\n\nIf you contribute a lot to this group, you are completely allowed to burn out, especially if you give in this group a lot (and I love you for it!) You are absolutely welcome to take a break. There's a lot of people in need, and I'm hoping with tweaks to this group (and an upcoming plan I'm working on behind the scenes), we can offer even more actionable support, without feeling drained at the end of the day.\n\nThat said, I am open to ideas about select, little known helpful resources and how to position them in this group for best effect. Group Wiki? Does anyone actually read those? I'm only allowed 2 pinned posts at any one time so I'm not sure that's the best thing to use. I'm open to a new Rule that is actually just a link but what the link would go to, how to organize such a resource list....etc.\n\n**To sum up (and TL:DR)**  \nThat report to me has been somewhat useless in this group (except for the new Crisis Hotline partnership Reddit has, and yes the extreme ones I definitely send over to them!) I'd like people to only report to us when it's a more extreme \"suicide announcement\". Those who are on the lighter side, more just lost in the weeds, please use your energy to give them ideas and paths out instead. Community involvement welcome on what I'm saying (read the whole thing first then). I get the posts are tough, take care of your mental health and don't give more than you have per day. Open to resource-positioning ideas.\n\n**Update:** If I see a person who seems to be posting nothing but extreme suicidal posts, I will invoke the same 3 strikes rule we have with comments/shitposts - an automatic removal and ban, as 3 posts of the same type indicates an obvious attention/sympathy grab and no real wish for help or finding a path out. Definitely agree with y'all that finding a path should be the intent of a post (but I will never make it a rule of the group that a clear, direct request for a path is required in any post). Comments should always remain helpful or supportive to the idea that the poster can find a path even in their darkest hours.   \nThank you for helping me clarify what should be done - I might run 3 reddit groups now but I never want to assume I know what's best for any group without the group's participation.

Maybe the links and redirects could be to a compiled list of things to get involved in that can help someone to feel like they matter, like they're needed and they're making a difference... I believe there's an opportunity to set a new standard for the way we approach mental health... If there was a way to set aside certain jobs when they arise for this, instead of sending out the opening to our friends like we normally do simply pass the info on to a email repository (is that how it works? ) or something like that to make it easy, and that email data could be governed by ai, it would just categorize the info accordingly, it could be anything , \"help wanted\" \"tutor roles\" it could be a wide range of things, simply just opportunities  that have the potential to build self worth, all in one place... , like we come up with a criteria and pin the rules for what qualifies as one of these self help roles, then just have a forum that keep the opportunitys on a list with different categories etc etc. it would likely need to be an invite only type forum cause I'm sure It would start off slow..\n\nI was winging my way through most of this....but i think it could really be a great idea, it needs a lot of work, as far as hammering out the details...

Occasionally they post, but its completely outclassed by the number of negative posts from the people you're talking about.

I don't think they need to be reported, but I do think there needs to be a filter or a way to hide these. Also, the people who tend to make these posts don't seem to want help or to \"find a path,\" they want to rant/wallow, which I feel like should be taken elsewhere.\n\nFor some, it's super annoying to see someone in a similar position as them (or sometimes in a better position) being super negative and talking about how much it sucks and that they want to die... I've encountered this multiple times and it's DEPRESSING and it's worse for other people.\n\nIt *should* be a requirement to be at least a bit productive.

I\u2019m 36f, and I only discovered this year that I\u2019m a raver lol I know a little late bloomer over here, but after having kids, I kinda lost myself. I have social anxiety and tend to overthink. Did a lot of therapy to work on that but I\u2019m never one for big crowds. Little do I know, after being dragged to a huge rave this year, I found my spark. The community, the vibe, the freedom to be yourself, social anxiety who?! Anyway, all I\u2019m saying is to keep trying new things, I\u2019m almost 40 and I just found mine!\n\nAlso I learned this on sm which helps me when life gets \u201cdull\u201d. I love travelling, so even if it\u2019s just mini road trip or 1-2 big trips a year, I try to plan ahead as much as possible. Having those little milestones in my calendar gives me a bit of joy every time I come across it. It\u2019s so that I always have something to look forward to. \n\nHope this helps. Also congrats on all your amazing accomplishments!! It\u2019s so inspiring to hear you do a complete 180 with your life. You have definitely inspired me to get back on that proverbial treadmill and focus on my health again. So thank you!",
            "I think a lot of people put too much pressure on themselves to be happy or find joy, which can be blissful and euphoric but also very unexpected and short lived. The older I get, the more I think it is more about creating the space for a general range of contentment. From there, exploring what sparks your curiosity? Exploring what sparks your sense of awe and wonder about the world?\n\nBtw you\u2019re obviously a great communicator and bright. Maybe it\u2019s time for your life to be about more than just\u2026 you? I know I wouldn\u2019t have a sense of purpose and I would feel pretty empty inside if I didn\u2019t want to contribute to my community and mentor.",

            "There\u2019s no question here and hence there\u2019s no answers. Recruitment is a fickle game. 500 resumes is meaningless without feedback. Why do you think you\u2019re getting knocked back? \n\nI often worry myself that working for yourself makes you unemployable, like a dog that has bitten a human and can\u2019t be saved. Is that it? If not, then what?",
            "I might recommend getting a career consultant in the executive spaces, if you haven't already. Sometimes it's mostly just that people aren't experts in resumes (and how recruiters/hirers think) that keeps them unemployed - a small and fixable issue. \n\nOne of my past clients was a high powered exec who couldn't be more the definition of \"business consultant\". Seeing her resume was like attending an interview and ending up in an advertisement! I felt \"sold to\" in such a bait-and-switch way (and i was just analyzing her resume for general issues like a normal resume writer would).   \nI told her that, recommended some light changes on her resume and linkedin - and she was offered a job immediately through Linkedin. Sometimes it's just that extra professional feedback from someone that is nearer to the resume zone that identifies issues.",
            "Hello,\n\nSorry about your situation.\n\nI was in a very similar position to you about 8 months ago. I had my own SaaS company, we were in final stages of settling an acquisition and it fell through.\n\nI had the same mindset as you, I have a lot of workable skills, very solid background and experience. I sent out roughly 700 to 800 resumes over the next 7 months and just got two job offers yesterday. \n\nProbably the biggest thing I changed on my resume that started getting me interviews was taking off founder from my previous company as my title. I did not even talk about owning a company or being involved in starting a company, I spoke to the role as if I worked at that company in a position that was similar to the job I was applying to.\n\nI had really hard days and weeks as well, take a break when you need it, but I promise you resilience and keep moving forward is the key. One step at a time. Good luck.",
            "Someone that knew how to create value for the economy should be able to do that again with another type of value offering, right?\n\nMost people only know how to do what they're told in return for a wage. But you're different. Do you not have a 2nd idea because the 1st was being lucky as in right place; right time?",
            "I've been feeling the same way. It's very difficult and I'm sorry you're going through that. I'm tired and feel like I'm going through a mid-life crisis after quitting my career dream job. It also feels like all of the people who I have helped over the past 10 years have turned their backs on me. I find that trying to focus on the present helps. Ruminating makes me incredibly depressed. I was also lucky enough to find a psychiatrist who helped me get the proper medicine I needed. I'm still struggling most days and haven't found a new job yet, but I like to think that there's a reason I was pushed out of my comfort zone. We're strong, just exhausted for now. If you feel like you can, maybe try to use some of this time to rest. Up until this point, I wouldn't change anything I've been through because it got me here. 5-10 years from now, there will be a reason you look back on this time and think, wow, I'm really thankful that got me to where I am today.",
            "I live in San Francisco, and there is incredible nature on the way to the new projects where my grandma lives.  I think to myself why couldn't I appreciate this nature and had to go far off somewhere for college.  Knowledge is power, perspective is power.  Personally I spend time with the Bible through chatGpt and binge watch Netflix shows.  The algorithm didn't recommend Misaeng: Incomplete Life until last week and I'm on the last episode.  It's a masterclass.  Hope you find your perspective.",
