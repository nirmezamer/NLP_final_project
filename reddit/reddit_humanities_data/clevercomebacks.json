But I'm old, and I'm tired. I'm handing the \"stupid sticky comment at the top of the thread\" keys over to my fellow mods and the actual owner of the subreddit (no, this isn't my subreddit, I'm just the dumbass you all saw the most).\n\nThanks to everyone who ever called me based, a good mod, or even a goddamn idiot. Y'all are great, and I'll miss this fuckin place.\n\n(also in b4 \"this ain't an airport, you don't have to announce your departure\")",
