            "The shut off in my house was apparently encased in concrete at one point which caused a problem and flooded the basement corner. They solved it by cutting a long trench along where the pipe was in the wall and after installing a proper shutoff inside and encasing it, they filled the trench with glass blocks which light up our basement. \n\nIt's a really weird arrangement when you glance at it and think...what the heck? We found out what happened when a caseworker for one of our adopted kids happened to also be a caseworker for the family that lived there when it flooded. It was such a weird coincidence.",

            "They are not serious. Most likely caused by drywall being installed with a seam where two pieces meet over the door opening. You can patch it but it will most likely crack again in the exact same place. The proper way to install drywall is by using a whole piece and then cutting out the door opening. But it is only cosmetic and not an indication of a structural problem.",
