        "content": "Buying a property (in blue) with quite a bit more privacy than what I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nI grew up in dense subdivisions with semi detached homes and everyone seeing everyone\u2019s business. While this can be annoying, to the point of not feeling comfortable hanging out in your own backyard, it\u2019s also a bit of a comfort, knowing that you have multiple eyes on your home. \n\nThe house that we are buying is on a 4 acre lot, with a single wide (un-lit) 500\u2019 driveway. You can\u2019t see anything from the house aside from the road (500\u2019 away) and the smallest glimpse of the neighbours property through the tree line, during the winter. Summer time will has foliage that obscures it entirely. \n\nWe plan to have a security system installed, as we have now. Consisting of door / window contacts, motion sensors and the addition of a camera or two (primarily one pointing up the driveway). \n\nWe also have plans to install solar powered motion activated lights along the driveway on the power poles (the power company may bark about it, but I\u2019m willing to take the risk lol). \n\nThis new subdivision is considered quite safe, and incident free, but my wife works from home and we do want her to feel comfortable and safe. \n\nAny tips, tricks, devices/products or advice?  \n\nWe have 2 young children and a dog, no braver than Scooby Doo.
