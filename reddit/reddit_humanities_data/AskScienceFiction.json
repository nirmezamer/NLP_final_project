I don\u2019t really have any evidence to back this up, but the fact is that everyone who could have wrestled it from Sauron\u2019s control but still be corrupted - Gandalf, Galadriel\u2026 maybe Elrond - were not as powerful as Sauron. His corrupted essence tainted the ring. But the Valar are far more powerful than him. I think the ring would be a trinket to them as it would be for Bombadil. \n\nBut it could be abused if it fell into the hands of the elves living there.",
            "The Valar are more powerful than Sauron so it is safe to assume the One Ring wouldn't have any power over them. The problem would be getting it to the Undying Lands in the first place without the ring sensing what is happening and tempting someone into taking it back to Middle Earth. Remember that the entire reason Frodo left the Fellowship was because Borimir fell under the ring's influence and tried to take it from him. He couldn't guarantee that anybody else wouldn't feel prey to the One Ring.\n\nIf you have a ship full of people then it increases the danger that someone will fall prey to the One Ring, or worse, you will have multiple people fall prey and the ring will drive them to kill each other.",

Sauron can no longer recover it and the power he placed in it.\n\nBUT Sauron would still be in action and without the ring being destroyed the can no longer do anything to stop his takeover. Even without the ring, Sauron wasn't something the people of middle earth could face at that point in time,",

            "The Valar would have refused passage to the boat carrying the ring.\n\nIf for some reason they didn't, I don't doubt that Aul\u00eb would be perfectly capable of unmaking the ring",
            "Almost certainly yes.\n\nThe Valar are magnitudes more powerful than Maia and one of the Valar residing in the Undying Lands is Aul\u00eb, the greatest craftsman in existence and the one who actually though Sauron the craft of forging. \n\nFor Aul\u00eb unmaking the One Ring would be an easy task to accomplish. Them not admitting the One Ring to the Undying Lands is just another example of their pattern of avoiding responsibility for what's clearly a problem they should be dealing with.\n\nAs a side note, the concern of destruction and collateral damage in Middle Earth is also blown out of proportion. The only reason the War of Rath was so destructive is bcs the Valar were fighting one of their own, Morgoth, arguably the most powerful of them all, while on his home turf (Morgoth has expended much of his essence into the matter of Middle Earth making it his own \"ring\" of sorts). The armies on both sides were of an unimaginable scale and the entities involved were powerful and at the peak of their abilities. The opening confrontation of the war was the destruction of Morgoth's orc army which was counting in the tens of millions.\n\nSauron on the other hand is a mostly depowered Maia who can barely hold a physical form without the Ring and a million orcs top, with a couple of emaciated ghosts as bodyguards.\n\nA squad of high elves with a Valar could walk up to the black gates, bitch slap Sauron out of Barad-d\u00fbr and drag his sorry ass to the undying lands to bitchslap him a second time over the Door of Night without any casualty.",

The most common Hellblazer plotline is \"Constantine's drunken, reckless, half assed scheme blows up in his face and seriously traumatises/cripples/kills one or multiple of his friends/acquaintances/former friends that hate him.\"\n\nBatman messed up a lot too, but he usually takes the situation seriously and tries his utmost best. He doesn't just muck around for fun, or underestimate his opponents, or do something dumb because of petty ego or malice or fear, unlike Constantine.\n\nAnd Batman is a highly educated, bona fide genius, who can be considered a leading expert in multiple fields. He spent years diligently training his craft under top masters - including Zatara, one of Constantine's old mentors.\n\nMeanwhile, Constantine has a good understanding of the magical world, has a (shrinking) network of contacts, and is very cunning - but he's no genius, and definitely not the leading expert in any field of magic. He relies more on \"street knowledge\" i.e. rumours/gossip, rather than focused study.\n\nHe's mostly a conman desperado that's good at bamboozling people, and leveraging his overinflated reputation. He's the most accomplished conman in the magical world - but  even Constantine admits that was mostly just dumb luck and bravado.\n\nConstantine's probably better characterised as a better gambler than Batman. Batman would never risk the lives of innocents, especially not on improbable long shots. If Joker confronted him with some sadistic trolley problem, he'd begrudgingly go for the most rational, utilitarian approach, or try to rescue everyone.
