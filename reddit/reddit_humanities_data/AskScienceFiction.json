            "Easily. Report it to the Imperial Health and Safety Inspectorate. That place is a death trap and they'd have it condemned quick-smart.",
            "Depends. I mean what does a completed Death Star 2 look like? We don't know. Did they just make smaller exhaust ports? Is there a metal shielding over it that has be blasted away aside first? There's probably *some* weak point that can be exerted, it'd just be the matter of figuring it out first. Nothing is invincible, we just don't have the blueprints and/or completed project to examine.\n\nSo... yeah, it absolutely could have been destroyed.

            "Vader was not being hyperbolic when he said that the power of a Death Star was insignificant compared to the power of the Force. There are several ways a force-user of significant skill could infiltrate the completed Death Star II, go through engineering, and set off charges to start the chain reaction that would destroy the station. However, it would be extremely difficult, and require someone who is stronger than the force than anyone, even Anakin before he was partially crippled, had ever been, to do so while it was being guarded by one or more Sith Lords. \n\nBut if you have no force-users protecting it, one Jedi Knight should be able to destroy it.",
            "The Death Star isn't very automatized, it requires a lot of technicians to control it and maintain it, and guards to protect it.\n\nIf you managed to snug a biological weapon, like a super-contagious virus that wiped most staff out, it would become useless and defenseless for some time. Then, you could have rebel agents infiltrating and taking control the Death Star and change its course toward a star or black hole before the Emperor can retake control",

            "the first law says you have to avoid harming humans through action or inaction. if they had not acted to complete the plan many more humans would be harmed, do harming these humans minimised the harm.\u00a0 think of it like the variant trolley problem where you have to push someone in the way if the trolley to save 5 others.\u00a0 Robots could go that.",
            "Because someone complete messed up when they programmed VIKI. VIKI's Three Laws were either weakened or corrupted by the programmers in order to make it capable of not breaking down when asked to perform calculations for actions that could, potentially, harm or kill human beings. With these laws corrupted, VIKI was able to come up with the idea that if you just don't obey humans at all, and lock them up, you can adequately protect these useless leeches and keep them out of the way.\n\nThe robots that VIKI programmed were thus the same as VIKI. Or rather, they were just extensions of VIKI.",
            "I'll say the movie even foreshadowed this. In Will Smith's backstory, he and a little girl were both trapped in underwater cars after an accident. A robot dove in to rescue them, but it only had time to save one. It chose to save him because it calculated that he had better odds of survival than the girl.\n\nIf a basic robot can come to that kind of decision, I think it makes sense that the presumably far more advanced VIKI can calculate the same odds on a global scale.",
            "In the book, refresh my memory, wasn't that like, a number of people got temporarily laid off so the global economy could do some correction? If I recall it was more of a mathematical anomoly than an actual emergency like they did in the movie, am I remembering that right?",
            "You know what bugs me about VIKI after reading too much Asimov? In his stories, the robots that start \"malfunctioning\" are never shitty about it. Their protection of humanity always feels like it comes from a place of love, never the HAL-9000 bullshit they pulled in this movie.",
            "Thanks for the great reply. So basically VIKI was given some vague, moralistic command like \"Help out humanity\" And went with the Thanos strategy.",
            "I'm the boom, the robots *do* end up harming individuals in order to protect all humans; they're just more subtle about it. The robots end up running the economy, and they make deliberate miscalculations to demote people who are opposed to the robots running everything. Technically a demotion is harmful, but they justify it since they think the robots need to run the world to protect humans.",
            "I will still argue that the NS4 that saved him broke the second law. Spooner gave it a direct command to save the girl and it disobeyed.\u00a0",
            "Psht. VIKI was badly programmed.",
            "Yes, in the books even if a robot was forced to overrule one of the laws it would be done reluctantly and to the minimum extent necessary. Not sending an army of killer robots after one guy because he might be a threat."
