I've had time to separate myself and after reading comments here it is starting to make sense. I never saw the malintent behind the word until the storm hit and in all truth it was difficult to understand both sides on the matter. I side with the ban of the word.",

I can\u2019t understand how they say trans people don\u2019t see it as a slur but then also attack the trans community for being happy that it\u2019s banned. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t find another place to feed my need of anime memes but the community here seems much better.",

            "I actually agree with the ban of the T-word it is a slur and can be extremely hurtful to a trans person. I just wished that every thing didn't get blown out of proportion. It just a word that the mods are saying you shouldn't  use simple as that. Just like  I don't like it when  non-black people say the n-word and non-white people  say the c-word (I'm black myself) I'm all for freedom of speech but using hurtful slurs shouldn't be tolerated.",
