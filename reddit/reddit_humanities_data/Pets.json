        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI don't post in this subreddit often; I mostly lurk. Not 20 minutes ago I was out with my 14 year old tuxedo cat Ferb - I'm visiting my fiance in Wisconsin, a *world* away from where I was born and raised, which is New York, NY.\n\nBefore I embarked on the 13 hour drive here, I made the decision to bring my two babies - 14 year old tuxedo boy Ferb and 8 year old cow cat Peppa (I have pictures further back on my profile).\n\nWhere my fiance lives, it's common to see 4ft+ tall cranes wandering around on the property (as well as tenants walking their dogs). I thought I might as well take Ferb outside to go gawk at the birds.The weather was okay today, so I thought I'd put a harness on Ferb (he has all his flea & tick meds too) and take him outside.\n\nNot even 15 minutes into being outside, walking Ferb on the sidewalk, one of my fiance's neighbors opened her door and (in my opinion) *yelled* at me rather rudely, saying \"Can't you walk your cat somewhere else?\" followed by some dogs barking from within her residence.\n\nI am from NYC/central/upstate NY, and I have never been reprimanded in public like I just was for *walking my senior cat*. Am I really disrupting the neighborhood when I walk Ferb? I feel like he doesn't even do anything - he just sniffs the brick walls and then meows at me after 10 minutes so he can go back inside. I'm kind of upset over this encounter.",

Usually I just tell them \u201cno, I\u2019ve got as much right to enjoy nature with my cats as you do with your dogs\u201d then just carry on walking.

That woman had no right to blame you or your lovely cat for her dogs being ill-behaved and badly trained. That\u2019s on HER. \n\nYou are absolutely allowed to walk your cat.

            "Yeah - this isn\u2019t your problem.  She needs to train her dogs.     \n\nA few months ago, someone posted a picture of their newly acquired kitten alongside a handwritten note from a neighbor that had been stuck to her door - asking her to not allow the kitten to look out the window as it was causing the neighbor\u2019s dogs to bark.   \ud83d\ude02",
            "I have a reactive dog who would absolutely love to eat a cat, and we\u2019ve passed folks walking their cats before. Instead of yelling at them for existing we just crossed the street.

Because it isn't their fault.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.",

I have three tiny, and very painful puncture wounds. \n\nWe were able to verify with the vet that she had all her shots, including rabies. \n\nI would like to remind everyone that it is super important to seek medical attention after a dog bite, as they are very prone to infection. I needed a tetanus shot and I was sent home with antibiotics as a precaution, and a healthy dose of embarrassment for having to go to the ER i work at to show some of my coworkers my behind. \n\nI would also like to remind everyone that breed specific legislation is dumb. \n\nGoodnight !",

The dog is poorly behaved is she howls and bites someone because they won\u2019t give her their food. I hope your friend declines to ever watch her again. She is a liability."

            "I had a dog for 18 years, he was like the other half of me, he never caused me any trouble, he was just my best friend. I knew about a month before I had him euthanised that it was time, but I kept him going on painkillers. He wasn't eating much so he was losing weight, he couldn't manage stairs any more so I was carrying him up and down at bedtime, he couldn't handle heat and it was summer so I was out with him at 4am sluicing him down with cool water so he wouldn't overheat, basically I was desperately trying to keep him alive because I wasn't ready to let him go. \n\nOne morning I carried him out into the garden (we have steps) and he just stood in the grass and gave me this look and I knew he was done, he just didn't have it in him to keep going any more. I had him PTS that afternoon and in the months that followed I realised that it would have been kinder to let him go long before I did. \n\nWe had another second dog at the time,  younger, and unfortunately two years later he was diagnosed with an untreatable cancer. We knew he had a matter of months left, so we kept him comfortable with meds and 1.5 months later he started having attacks of irregular breathing and shaking. He was very distressed in these moments, so my partner and I decided to give him one last good day. We booked his euthanasia for the afternoon and then we took him to his favourite park and walked around the lake and he had a feast of his favourite foods, then I took him to the vets and said goodbye. He'd never known suffering in his life and I didn't want him to suffer at the end.\n\nI was with both my boys, holding them and whispering to them as they went. It's incredibly sad, I have tears running down my face as I write this 6 years later, but I only have guilt about my older dog, as I let him experience suffering, I wish I'd let him go sooner and I won't make that mistake again.",
            "I had to do it a few days ago. I was an absolute mess but i had to tell myself how the decision is a practical one, not an emotional one. She was in pain and I couldn\u2019t make any selfish decisions to prolong her life. My husband consistently talked sense into me and now I\u2019m just grateful her and I were able to share a life together. It will hurt non stop. But it\u2019s for the best, I promise you",
            "I don't think anyone can really make sense of it. She is your best friend, and you will always love her and she will always love you. I guess all you really need to do is just separate yourself from the emotional and the logical part. If she is in pain the best thing to do is to let her go. Be with her until the very end don't leave her alone in those final moments.",
            "It\u2019s one of the hardest things you will ever do. But we have to do what\u2019s right for them. Don\u2019t prolong any suffering of hers to ease yours. I had to put my boy down a few years ago. His quality of life just wasn\u2019t there any more. He was having difficulty walking and also wasn\u2019t realizing when he needed to use the bathroom. It was not a dignified existence for him. \n\nI struggled picking up the phone to call the vet, I would just burst into tears. Instead I emailed them to ask some questions about cost and cremation. Once I had a little more information, a few days later I was able to muster the strength to make the call to schedule the appointment. I made it for a week out so I could have time to say goodbye to him properly. Spoiled him to the max every day. I\u2019m starting to cry even now just thinking about it. He was 16 and I loved him so much. We had a lot of good years and adventures together. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough, but you\u2019d rather do it too soon than too late. You\u2019ll need time to heal. Eventually you will probably be ready for another pal. They will help you continue healing. Mine sure did.",
            "Honestly it will be fucking hard and you\u2019ll need to have a good support system of friends and family and therapy. But you have to think about what\u2019s best for your dog. She\u2019s in your care. You need to do right by her and get things in order to make sure you also can take care of yourself and then brace yourself for the grief.",
            "I'm really sorry you're going through this. I just had to do it to my girl of 16 years a couple weeks ago. But having let my childhood cat pass on his own about a decade ago, *not* making the call can be a lot worse.\n\nMy dog got to ride into the office in her padded wagon after a couple days of lots of special treats. One little stick that she didn't even react to and she probably felt the best she'd felt in her entire life before the vet did the final shot. The day of, I mostly just felt relief that she was no longer struggling. \n\nIt hurts really bad, but her last day was so nice and peaceful and I'm glad I could do that for her.",
            "As hard as it is, the most selfless thing you can do for your dog is put them down and end their misery. I had to wait and cry for 2 months watching my dog deteriorate and suffer because the vet said \u2018he still eats and has good days\u2019. It was horrible watching him suffer and it was horrible putting him down. But in hindsight i did him a favor and should have put pressure on putting him down even sooner. I told myself i\u2019ll take time to get another dog, was on valium and my mom came over so i don\u2019t do anything stupid to myself. What helped me, a month after i put my dog down, i paid a deposit for a puppy. It brought me to life to wait for my dream puppy. I still get sad thinking about the old one (i actually told my new work colleague about him today so i take it as a sign he is checking up on me) and no one will replace him. It\u2019s been 5 years already. I have his urn and talk to it sometimes when my dogs annoy me. I wish you all the best OP, bit do what is best for your dog, it\u2019s the last show of your love to it \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I had to have my 18 year old cat euthanized a couple of weeks ago. I agonized for weeks about the decision, and I cried all day when he died.  I found myself going to clean the litter box every day afterward, so I started searching the local animal shelters for older cats.  I just adopted a bonded pair of 10-year-old cats who had been living in a cage at the shelter for seven months.  Not everyone is emotionally ready to adopt so soon, but I am very happy to two new kitties in my home. They take turns sitting on my lap.",
            "You should think about her perspective. Let her die with dignity. It would be cruel to draw out her death and cause her to suffer because you are afraid of making that choice. It's hard, but it's necessary.",
            "Its definitely the hardest and most selfless decision you have to make when it's time. If your pet has no quality of life left or are in pain, it's time to let them go. It hurts to do but it's for the best."
