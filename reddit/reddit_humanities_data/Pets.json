        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI don't post in this subreddit often; I mostly lurk. Not 20 minutes ago I was out with my 14 year old tuxedo cat Ferb - I'm visiting my fiance in Wisconsin, a *world* away from where I was born and raised, which is New York, NY.\n\nBefore I embarked on the 13 hour drive here, I made the decision to bring my two babies - 14 year old tuxedo boy Ferb and 8 year old cow cat Peppa (I have pictures further back on my profile).\n\nWhere my fiance lives, it's common to see 4ft+ tall cranes wandering around on the property (as well as tenants walking their dogs). I thought I might as well take Ferb outside to go gawk at the birds.The weather was okay today, so I thought I'd put a harness on Ferb (he has all his flea & tick meds too) and take him outside.\n\nNot even 15 minutes into being outside, walking Ferb on the sidewalk, one of my fiance's neighbors opened her door and (in my opinion) *yelled* at me rather rudely, saying \"Can't you walk your cat somewhere else?\" followed by some dogs barking from within her residence.\n\nI am from NYC/central/upstate NY, and I have never been reprimanded in public like I just was for *walking my senior cat*. Am I really disrupting the neighborhood when I walk Ferb? I feel like he doesn't even do anything - he just sniffs the brick walls and then meows at me after 10 minutes so he can go back inside. I'm kind of upset over this encounter.",

        "content": "I had a German shepherd that was beginning to suffer from arthritis in her lower back and back legs. Her status at that point was that she would have to give a bit more effort to stand up and would walk slow, but no where near the point where putting her down was a consideration (I would have done that if it was at that point). She was still happy, ate normal, etc. \n\nI took her to the vet and brought up the topic of her back legs starting to give her trouble and maybe there might be medication that could at least help her out. This is where we were giving a pain and inflammation medication and another one called, Gabapentin which is for the nerves.\nThe next morning she was fine, played a bit, had you toy in her mouth, and do her normally excitement whining. I gave her the medication and by 2-3 in the afternoon she wasn\u2019t able to stand and looked drowsy. I know this was a side effect, but I still had her with me in the living room and we watched tv all day. Around 1040 pm I called it a day and make sure she was comfortable in her bed. One hour later, I decided to go back into the living room to tell her goodnight one more time and she was dead. \nI was shocked, sadden, and most curious on what the hell went wrong? \n\nHas anyone heard or had any experiences like this with Gabapentin? \n\nI plan to talk to the vet about what the possibility might be and find some answers. I know there isn\u2019t much I can do, but I decided to write this post to give out awareness and maybe some people can take better precaution before giving them strong medication like that. I just feel horrible inside knowing this happened.",

            "Vet tech here, it's extremely unlikely that the gabapentin contributed to her death. It's a very safe medication with a wide therapeutic index and is used in human medicine as well.",
            "That medication is commonly used in humans it should not have been the cause of death.",
            "My boy is 13, has bad arthritis and has had a Femoral head ostectomy on one femur, so you know his arthritis is bad, he also has a liver shunt so he has to be very careful with his medications, he has been on Gabapentin for over a year and a half, twice a day to three times if he is very stiff. And he is thriving. This is just my two cents, but I doubt the Gabapentin was the issue here with your sweet baby. I\u2019m not a vet though. Most probably it was something else",
            "We have been giving gabapentin for years to our dogs when needed. Even daily for a while for one of my previous dogs. \n\nUnfortunately there probably was a larger unknown issue going on :( I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.",
            "Probably just a sad coincidence. My mom has been on lots of gabapentin just to function since her MS diagnosis and it'll make you sleepy sometimes but it's not something that'll create a dangerous level of sedation generally.",
            "That's really tough. For what it's worth our large dog takes gabapentin about once a month for her vet visit for allergy shots. She gets drowsy/dopey but it's always been fine after a night. It likely just made your pups last day more relaxed",
            "She was ready to go, the body just gave out. The meds did not do this. It was over time and there was not much the vet, or any other one could have done. Your German Shephard, they usually do not live a long time, and 13 is rare for them to live. She was ready to go. So sorry this happened. Talk with the vet, anyway. it is easier to learn about the other factors at the time she passed. Just know she is pain free now and no longer suffering. She is in a better place, at the Rainbow Bridge. So sorry for your loss.",
            "Pharmacist here. Some formulations of gabapentin contain xylitol which is fatal to dogs if ingested. I assume this was not the cause of issue here since I think only brand name Neurontin liquid contains xylitol but it is something to research. Sorry to hear about your pet, wishing you the best",
            "Im so sorry you lost your lovey, 13 is getting up there for a large dog. At least the gabapentin helped his pain as he passed. Our little boy is on it right now torn ACL surgery in a couple weeks. It's also used for fear of fireworks.  Can't wait to see if it works on the 4th. Nothing else has worked",
            "My GSD was on gabapentin for pain as well as  cbd for his seizures. At the end of his life, the vet warned me that the pre euthanasia sedative might be enough to end his life. He slipped away almost immediately from the sedative. \n\nIf your dog was very close to the end that might have been enough."

She decided to chomp the side of my ass. It was more so a play nip than an aggressive bite and she immediately let go when I vocalized pain, but it still broke the skin. I have three tiny, and very painful puncture wounds. \n\nWe were able to verify with the vet that she had all her shots, including rabies. \n\nI would like to remind everyone that it is super important to seek medical attention after a dog bite, as they are very prone to infection. I needed a tetanus shot and I was sent home with antibiotics as a precaution, and a healthy dose of embarrassment for having to go to the ER i work at to show some of my coworkers my behind. \n\nI would also like to remind everyone that breed specific legislation is dumb. \n\nGoodnight !",

The dog is poorly behaved is she howls and bites someone because they won\u2019t give her their food. I hope your friend declines to ever watch her again. She is a liability.",
