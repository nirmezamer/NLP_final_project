            "Many reasons. One is because they are having problems with another inmate at that facility. They might have gotten sentenced and now needs to go to a federal or state prison. They might move someone to a jail closer to their court. Some inmates may have medical issues and need to go to a facility that treats their medical needs. I was getting transferred because I tried to have inappropriate relationship with a female staff, custody level and points also matter and another reason is for no reason at all."

            "actually you weren't too far off..you bid an amount on public contracts (like the movie War Dogs) and if you win, the govt verifies ur facilities are legit then boom, you own a prison and they start sending crims your way. they send a pre determined amount of convicts per year and you get paid.\nthe US is not a real place",
            "cant guarantee this is the right answer but it will be something similar to this\n\nIn England we have what is called PFI's a good readup is here - [Private finance initiative - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_finance_initiative)\n\nthe tldr is a private company agrees to build some infastructure for the government. The private company pays entirely for the build themselves.. maybe they get some subsidies or grants etc from the govenrment to help and ypu they will leverage their position to get loans\n\nOnce the project is complete the government then signs like a 100 year rental on the building, maybe its just a manintenace agreement whatever. We will pay x per year for a long ass time.  the long and short is the government will pay annually for that property for the next 50 or 100 years\n\nSo the private company might pay 20million to build it, but the government agrees a maintenance contract of 100 years for 200million or whatever.\n\nAgain. can't guarantee that is the right answer in 100% of cases in all countries , but some variant of a PFI is used for a lot of things like prisons schools hospitals etc. You don't build it in the hope someone needs it. You build it because you have a contract that spans generations to guarantee income to you and yours. Government contracts are the golden egg of all contracts. They (again depending on country) will almost always pay\n\n  \nOn a side note - PFIs are a way to tackle recession. Construction is often first hit when a recession starts, but often the first to recover as it's something the govenment can directly stimulkate without immediate spending",
            "There's probably a lot more empty ones than we all probably realize. California had an overflow out in Okla. That shut down after a riot, they just sold it & filled it up with dudes from Oklahoma. once you buy your spot\nthe bank will immediately be calling their liaison to the pharmaceutical industry bc you're going to want inmates as confused, angry, & sleepy as possible. Even though they typically have their own drugs. You might get bonus points for letting them use some experimental laughing gas in the \"dentist office\".. They get a bad rap but I always found those facilities to be the easiest to do time. The plumbing usually works, meals are on time, appears cleaner, everything is the same. Making the time fly",
