            "I hear $$$$ the prisons / jails get to charge the state or county a lot of money to move an inmate, put them on a bus that is already going to the destination, a lot of charges they get to take in that do not really cost that much.",
            "Many reasons. One is because they are having problems with another inmate at that facility. They might have gotten sentenced and now needs to go to a federal or state prison. They might move someone to a jail closer to their court. Some inmates may have medical issues and need to go to a facility that treats their medical needs. I was getting transferred because I tried to have inappropriate relationship with a female staff, custody level and points also matter and another reason is for no reason at all.",
            "At MCJ in Los angles the sheriff's are paid each time they move an inmate so a lot of guys in our dorm would be there for a week or 2 then get sent to  wayside for a week or 2 then shipped backed. Total scam.",
            "\"There are tons of reasons, none of them good\"\n\nMaybe... but, programming can be an issue.  Court ordered SUD programming - facility IP is in doesn't have an RTC or programming - transfer inbound.  In theory, this can be good...",
            "I was arrested on probation violation (DWI) a decade ago. I was transferred to 5 different jails the 3 months I was in.\nJust 1 charge, no other warrants not even traffic tickets. \n\nSometimes they just want to be dicks because they can. Anytime I asked where I was going, theyd act like I was being transferred to state jail just to put me in county and city jails.\nShit drove me nuts.",
            "Some people acquire debts they cant pay and then they rat  and check in and some move for legitimate reasons like a security change. You could go from med.- a camp level or you can do like I did and go backwards and end up in ad. seg. but thats not bad because you get a single cell and room service and I love having those fucking police bringing me all of my shit. I have seen dudes that have been in 4-5 different joints in 18-24 months and thats always suspect to me"

While the command staff love our idea and work because of the results it\u2019s shown (cleanliness, major reduction in assaults, etc), we do not have a budget for these dorms. We have local organizations come in weekly and facilitate classes and what not. A lot of worksheets and what not come out of pocket. But I really want to start a book club\u2026however, the cost associated with that is something I can\u2019t cough up currently. Anyone have leads on authors/groups/orginizations/or even individuals who would consider donating maybe 10 of the same book/workbooks? I HATE asking for free things in a world like today, but I\u2019m really trying to provide worthwhile curriculum that could help these men stay engaged and focused on changing their lives. I\u2019m open to any and all leads. Also feel free to ask questions about the block concept too!",
