        "content": "Hey r/WouldYouRather Community!\n\nAs your mod team, we\u2019ve noticed a shift in how our beloved \u201cWould You Rather\u201d questions are being posted lately. While it\u2019s fantastic to see the community so active and engaged, we\u2019ve observed that many of you have stopped using the poll feature and are instead posting questions expecting answers in the comments.\n\nWe wanted to reach out to explain why the poll feature is such a valuable tool and encourage everyone to start using it again!\n\n**Why Use Polls?**\n\n1. Instant Results: Polls allow for quick and easy voting, giving a clear and immediate view of the response to a question.\n2. Better Engagement: Polls tend to receive more participation because they are easy to interact with, meaning that more members will engage with your question.\n3. Focus on Discussion: While polls provide the main numbers, the comment section can then be used for in-depth discussions and explanations. This way, the discussion can focus on why people chose their answers rather than simply what they chose.\n\nHence, we believe that bringing back polls will make this subreddit even more fun for everyone.\n\n\n\n**How to Create a Poll:**\n\nCreating a poll is easy and only takes a few steps:\n\n1. Start a new post.\n2. Choose the \u201cPoll\u201d option.\n3. Type in your \u201cWould You Rather\u201d question.\n4. Add the options.\n5. Post!\n\nThanks,  \nYour Mod Team",

I think the rules mean that after 48hrs from first touching a book you can relearn that skill, because as read it seems easy to touch a book every 24 hours to keep a skill... then find a book that gives me the skill of talking to animals...
