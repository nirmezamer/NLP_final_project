Check out the most recent patch notes on the sidebar!\n\n**What is a simple question?** Typically, we define a simple question as something that can be answered fully within a single, or maybe two at most, comments. In this thread, you can ask any question you need answered about League of Legends, **even if it isn't necessarily about learning the game itself.**\n\nQuestions about what champ to add to your pool or general tip about roleswapping can also be asked in this thread.\n\n*Keep in mind we will still continue to remove golden rule violations, rants, memes, topics against Riot's ToS, and paid services - but the other rules are generally more lax here.*\n\n**What you can do to help!**\n\nFor now, this is a patch-based thread, meaning it will be posted once every two weeks.

I pressed OK and it closed my client. I tried launching the client again but couldn't reconnect to the game as the same error would appear as soon as I joined. I noticed Vanguard was active in my system tray so I thought \"weird, guess I'll just restart the laptop.\"\n\nIt turned off and now will not start at all. Pressing the power button only turns on the USB ports LEDs. Screen stays black, fans don't start spinning, and even the power button LED is off.\n\nSo far, I've tried:\n- accessing the BIOS upon pressing the power button. Nothing happened, no sound. Screen is off so I can't even be sure if didn't work. \n\n- resetting my BIOS. I disconnected my laptop main battery as well as the CMOS battery, then for two minutes did a bunch of holding the power button for 10 seconds before releasing it. I waited an hour before assembling it back but laptop still wouldn't start.\n\nAs of now, I called a Lenovo technician this morning. He doesn't believe Vanguard has anything to do with it, and offered to replace the motherboard. Would that even help? \n\nI apologise for the length of my message but am really desperate to find a fix.

        "content": "Disclaimer: Maining Lillia, a champ with bad ganks pre-6 and probably the worst tower diving for a melee champion because dots trigger tower shots isn't ideal for this. But in my experience, ganking bot feels often just way less consistent than ganking top.\nI wanna play devil's advocate here and argue why I personally prefer ganking top over bot and then I want you to explain to me why I am probably wrong lol.\n\nWhy I am ganking top:\n\nTop is less volatile, but one kill can potentially snowball harder.\n\nI don't know if it is just me, but it feels like in almost every game bot lane is just a constant Massacre. They are fighting, like, ALL THE TIME, and if there isn't like ten deaths before ten minutes,  it's a pure farm lane where nobody is in a good position to be ganked. This is due to the existence of the support, which can enable or disable fighting depending on the pick. Hook and engage supports are obviously more deadly than enchanters.\nTop is a different story. Usually there is one guy completely dominating the other and pushing him extremely hard into the tower, which is usually a perfect gank setup (btw I am playing in low Elo and people don't know when to push in and when not to. Often they push hard without rotating for an objective.). But they do not nessesarily outright kill each other. \n\nFrom my perspective, a good gank mostly relies on the surprise momentum and the number advantage. It's usually more convenient to bet on a  2v1 in top then a 3v2 in bot, primarily because there is a lot that can and will likely happen between the moment I move towards it and my arrival. Chances are the moment I am there somebody is already dead and there goes my chance for the Gank - regardless of on which side the death is. If the death is on my team, there is no numbers advantage anymore and my teammate is probably going to recall or just hold the line and my Gank wouldn't change much. If the enemy dies, he is going to flee under his tower and there goes my Gank opportunity.\nIn top this happens in general just way less often.\n\nTop in general has it also easier to really snowball with the advantage from the Gank because it's in general just the more statchecky lane. While ADCs main damage is also mostly point and click, the dynamic with range and the support makes it way easier for both sides to swing the tide into the other direction (which is also what is ment with \"bot is volatile\").\n\nI know that the ADC is supposed to be the primary carry of the game in the late game and top lane is kinda more ambiguous in how much impact they will have, but in all honesty, in soloq at least it feels something extremely random who will actually carry in the end. Might be also because of my low Elo and that I often play normals.\n\nThat would be the reasons I have why I prefer ganking top. Now pls comment why I am wrong lol",

            "the rule of thumb with early game ganking is to gank the most volatile lane, because you can swing the advantage in your favour the most, or the lane with the best gank set up. If top lane has two bruisers, they\u2019ll be fighting a bunch, meaning you can swing the fights in favour of your team and leverage that advantage. If your bot lane has good gank set up, like blitz/naut/leo etc, ganks are much more likely to work out bot. So before you even load in, look at your lanes to see where the most volatile match up is, and where the best gank set up is. Path towards that lane initially. Don\u2019t force ganks that aren\u2019t there though. Lilia is not an early game powerhouse, which means that ganks are a matter of opportunity. Wasted time on a gank is time lost clearing, so never go out of your way to force unless it\u2019s basically guaranteed you can convert the gank.  \n\nFrom there play around your win condition, which will be team and game dependant. I also would say, especially with top, you often don\u2019t want to be camping top once the lane is effectively won lane. That\u2019s not to say don\u2019t gank a winning lane, but don\u2019t gank a WON lane. Because now the outcome doesn\u2019t change with or without you. You have to know top matchups to know when this is though, as it differs each game. But as a top main, if I\u2019m 3-0 with a level and CS lead, I don\u2019t want my jungler showing up unless I ping for it, it can slow down my tempo. Instead, I want my jgl to leverage my pressure into snowballing the game state. Play OFF your strongest members now. That could be as basic as counter jungle topside if your laner is strong and able to assist. Sometimes that is cross mapping, like if your fed top is pushing T2 top and dragon is up. Or it might be about hovering them when you know the enemy team are looking to shut them down. \n\nSame principle applies for bot really. Make sure your carry doesn\u2019t get shut down, leverage their pressure to advance the game state further etc. but if bot is ahead, you don\u2019t want to cross map them like you would with top. Instead you\u2019d want to enable them to get as much as they can. Hover them so they can get tower gold and cs safely, play for obj and fights, etc",
            "As an adc suffering in low elo, the best moment to gank is when I\u2019m being pushed under my tower. Just activate sweeper and run at the enemy from behind. However, check the state of the wave first. Ganking when I have 3 waves under my tower is gonna get all 3 of us killed, most likely. \nSometimes I\u2019ll let the enemy push into me even tho I\u2019m much stronger just because I want them in a position where it\u2019s easy for the jungler to come and gank. \n\nPlease, for the love of rngeesus, don\u2019t take my wave if you did ganked and took a kill or 2. I don\u2019t mind you helping me push when I have to crash a wave after gank, but if you only come bot to tax 3 waves coming my way for no reason, imma follow you around jungle and the game is gonna go to hell.",

I swear yesterday I was playing and 5 games in a row not one gank top side, didn\u2019t matter if I was 5/0/0 or 0/3/0, I\u2019ve got to the point that if I\u2019m ahead enough I\u2019ll go take grubs or Harold by my self. It\u2019s been so bad in the recently I switch to jungle so I could maybe understand why they don\u2019t gank top but nope still don\u2019t get it cause your natural rotation of camps will have you right there to gank them multiples times in the first 10 min",
