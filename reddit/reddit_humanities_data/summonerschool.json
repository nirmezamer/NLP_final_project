        "content": "Hello summoners!\n\nIn order to create better discussion in the subreddit, we will be redirecting all simple or championpool/role questions to this thread. Check out the most recent patch notes on the sidebar!\n\n**What is a simple question?** Typically, we define a simple question as something that can be answered fully within a single, or maybe two at most, comments. In this thread, you can ask any question you need answered about League of Legends, **even if it isn't necessarily about learning the game itself.**\n\nQuestions about what champ to add to your pool or general tip about roleswapping can also be asked in this thread.\n\n*Keep in mind we will still continue to remove golden rule violations, rants, memes, topics against Riot's ToS, and paid services - but the other rules are generally more lax here.*\n\n**What you can do to help!**\n\nFor now, this is a patch-based thread, meaning it will be posted once every two weeks. Checking back on this thread later in the patch and answering any questions that have been posted would be a huge help!\n\nIf you're trying to ask a question, the more specific you are, the better it is for all of us! We can't give you any help if we don't get much to work with in the first place.\n\n**Resources**\n\n* [Our 101 page](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/101), with a *ton* of free content!\n* [Our weekly mentoring thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/megathreads#wiki_mentoring_thread): We have many users willing to provide free mentoring services!\n* [Champion discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/search?q=title%3Achampion+discussion+of+the+day%3A&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new): Check out our previous discussions on champions!\n* [Summoner School Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/summonerschool): A voice and text chat platform for teaching and learning.

            "When does MMR actually start mattering? Or is the matchmaking system just that f-ing garbage? I'm level 21 and have a 35% win rate. Yeah, I'm not good. But almost every game is a blow out of my team getting stomped. Then it's abundantly clear the other team is dozens of levels higher than due to their mastery and honor levels. I also found a tracker showing I was getting placed in Silver 3 lobbies on average last several games. But I've never touched ranked and with a 35% winrate I'm obviously not Silver level so are the developers just trash at matchmaking or does it not exist because I can't see any other options here. \n\nAlso, what's the best way to report smurfs? Just played against a guy who in only 3 games total and at level 5 had 27 kills and 3 deaths average. AVERAGE. It was abundantly clear he was a very high level smurf by how he was playing Yasuo and predicting every single ability of my Skarner perfectly. Or he was cheating, but I find that less likely but honestly I'm not sure.",

Please feel free to ask questions, detail issues or errors you experience, and give tips and directions regarding getting Vanguard to work properly. Feel free to also link videos or guides that are directly related to fixing Vanguard issues, as long as they adhere to all of the rules of the subreddit (especially Rule 9: No Paid Services).\n\nWhile we understand that this change and the software itself can be frustrating, rants and complaints about the topic are not helpful and will clutter up the thread. This thread is to help users fix their issues so that they can play League again, so any unproductive or off-topic comments will be removed.\n\nPlease see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1chh5rk/riot_vanguard_isnt_working_for_me_and_i_cant_run/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for current user-provided tips and work arounds.

            "its a boy and a yetti there is no she, also nunu is horrible in so many comps, scales poorly and has no damage when going tank, while having unreliable cc and being unplayable in a lot of games as ap, whether its because the team needs a frontline or because enemy has too much cc. zac is a much better tank engage option, and he does a lot more damage than nunu anyways."

        "content": "I have been playing league for a little over 2 years and a member of this community for a little over 6 months. It's been really enjoyable for me to share my knowledge of the game with brand new players who want to learn MOBA, who want to learn why they lose games, and who want to know how they can win them. Disappointingly, I am seeing how poor the reddit/league player base is at treating new players.\n\nr/summonerschool should be a place for welcoming new players, not a vent for frustrated, irritable individuals who are tired of new players.\n\nHere is a list of things that are true of any OP on this subreddit dedicated to learning:\n\n* OP deserves to be treated FAVORABLY whenever he expresses a genuine desire to improve himself. This is almost all OP's on this subreddit. We should upvote OP.\n* OP has his feelings hurt when the community punishes him for asking questions. We should almost never downvote OP unless they are obviously trolling the subreddit and making fun of new players (which I have seen).\n\nI have seen so many posts that are downvoted (literally negative votes) because OP does not share the beliefs of the people in this community, but OP is also obviously making an effort to learn. My suspicion is that a significant proportion of this community's 650 thousand members think, once they contribute enough, the shared knowledge in this community will grow. *This is an illusion.* r/summonerschool receives an endless pipeline of League's new players. These new players are expected to spout the same set of bad ideas over and over again until the end of time, or the end of League. Whichever comes first.\n\n\"I am an iron player, help me with these advanced techniques.\" \"I can't carry my team, I am in elo hell.\" This should be our bread and butter!\n\nIf *you* are in an irritable mood, if you are tired of new players, if you have not eaten enough food today, in my opinion, you should not engage this community in any way. \n\n**TLDR**: DO NOT downvote the new player base because they have said something the community considers inaccurate. They are literally here to address misunderstandings and downvoting them only serves to discourage their help seeking behavior. My newbies deserve better than to be 9x'd for making statements the community disagrees with.\n\nFeel free to stop reading, but one final thought:\n\nHow does learning happen? Learning happens when individuals engage in community discussion that seeks consensus and agreement. Unfortunately, this is taking place inside of Reddit's algorithm which does a terrible job of promoting this kind of [Socratic dialogue](https://mspguide.org/2022/03/18/socratic-dialogue/#:~:text=What%20is%20Socratic%20Dialogue%3F,the%20universal%20from%20the%20particular). Combating the algorithm so we can have better discussion requires us to realize that learning is not a competitive process, it is a communal one. This could be accomplished if people used upvoting much more in order to increase the visibility of those threads on this subreddit where Socratic dialogue is already occurring. It could also be helped if downvoting was reserved for those posts that are highly disingenuous and trolling the community, which are very rare in my experience.",
