Also ensure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 many modern Intel motherboards should have BIOS flashback, allowing you to update the BIOS without needing the CPU or RAM installed, please consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure can very depending on the make and model. When utilising BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less, some implementations of BIOS flashback do not work well with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives larger than 8GB\n\n* If you are using a high-end RX 6000, RX 7000, RTX 30 or RTX 40 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6/8pin PCIe cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these might not be able to supply adequate power \u2014 some GPUs have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough or consistent power, please consult your GPU and PSU manual on how to correctly connect your GPU\n\n* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, some motherboards will not start if the RAM is installed in the secondary DIMM slots \u2014 the primary slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual\n\n* Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard \u2014 if this still doesn't work, try a different TV or Monitor and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest updates for your operating system, games and applications: these updates can help resolve many bugs and compatibility issues, especially with newer hardware or software\n\n* Scan your PC for any Viruses or Malware using Windows Defender or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution \u2014 Malware, Viruses, Adware and other unwanted software can cause security, stability and compatibility issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) and reinstall them. To reinstall GPU drivers and software, we recommend using [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit). To reinstall chipset, ME and other Intel drivers, we recommend letting Windows Update do them or by acquiring the latest from your system/motherboard vendors website\n\n* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG, Xbox, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using. Instructions can be found online for your respective game client \u2014 corrupt and/or missing files can cause games not to launch, crash and experience other performance and stability issues\n\n* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values.\n\n* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller \u2014 corrupt or missing files can cause programs to not launch, crash or experience other issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability\n\n* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or similar\n\n* Stability test your system with the utilities linked below if you experience crashes, freezes, system shut-down or just want to check \u2014 just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable. Many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it\n\n---\n\n[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/) \u2014 Ocbase is the home of OCCT, the most popular all-in-one stability / stress testing / benchmarking / monitoring tool available for PC.\n\n[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.\n\n[AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 System Stability Test uses a 64-bit multi-threaded stress testing module to drive the computer to its absolute limits. Hard disk, SSD and OpenCL GPGPU video adapter stress testing is also available.\n\n[Furmark](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/) \u2014 FurMark is a lightweight but very intensive graphics card / GPU stress test on Windows platform.\n\n[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance.\n\n[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.\n\n[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests.\n\n[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) \u2014 SeaTools - Quick diagnostic tool that checks the health of your drive.\n\nFor more advanced SSD/HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD/HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer specialised software to test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive.\n\nSome motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.\n\nA truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks/undervolts. \n\nIf you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.\n\n---\n\n* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current or future PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculator and make sure the PSU you have can output enough power when your system is under a full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system crashes when under load.\n\n* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html), [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator), [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/), [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/), [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator), [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator), you can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage\n\n* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit)\n\n* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...\n\n* If you've tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please backup any important data and completely reinstall your operating system \u2014 we recommend using the latest official ISO image available. **The use of utilities which modify Windows or using 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images can cause stability, security and compatibility issues**. For this reason, please use an official Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO image direct from Microsoft. We would also recommend performing a clean install with a USB. Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download)\n\nIf you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'cod crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough information to go on.**\n\n*Below is an example template you could use...*\n\n---\n\n**Summary of issue**: Graphical glitches when playing 'Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora' on 31.0.101.4972 if you have V-Sync enabled. This can be resolved if you revert to 31.0.101.4953.\n\n**What I have tried**: I have reinstalled 31.0.101.4972 with DDU, reset my in-game graphics settings, verified game files in Ubisoft Connect and confirmed issues is still present.\n\n**System Specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Windows 11 22H2, OS Build 22631.2715 (to find OS build version, press the Windows Key + R and type *winver*)\n* CPU: Intel Core\u2122 i5-13400F\n* CPU Cooler: DeepCool AK620 with included paste and both fans\n* GPU: Intel Arc A750 8GB Limited Edition\n* Motherboard: MPG B760M EDGE TI WIFI with 7E11v12 BIOS\n* RAM: Corsair DOMINATOR Titanium 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 w/ XMP \n* Storage: 4TB Seagate FireCuda 530 with Heatsink\n* PSU: MSI MPG A850G 850W ATX 3.0\n* Display: 27\" Samsung Odyssey G32A 1080p 165Hz with included DisplayPort cable\n\nFeel free to include any log files, dump files, videos, screenshots or images to assist others in understanding the issue.\n\n---",

            "**Summary of issue:** Intel Rapid Storage Technology app on Win 7 does not begin a rebuild of RAID\n\n**What I have tried:** I've got a ten year old machine with RAID 1 set up using Intel Smart Response Technology. Lately after several power cuts it started acting up in a way that suggests a drive issue, so I've decided to migrate from the 1 TB HDDs (by now 8 years old) to 2 TB SSDs.\n\nReplaced one of the HDDs in the RAID with one of the new SSDs. RAID shows as degraded, which is expected. According to what I can find and what I recall from the last time I did it 8 years ago, I should be able to begin a rebuild from the Rapid Storage Technology app.\n\nThe app prompts me to rebuild the RAID and offers to select the new SSD as a rebuild target. However, when I choose it as a rebuild target and click on the button to rebuild it, the SSD is marked as a spare and the RAID is still shown as degraded. After waiting a couple hours and refreshing the view in the app, there is no change from that state, and no indication that a rebuild was initiated. \n\n**System Specifications:** \n\n* MSI Z87-G43\n\n* 16 GB RAM\n\n* Core i5... I think 4690K (not 100% sure off the top of my head)\n\n* BeQuiet Pure Power 11 500W \n\n* RAID 1 set up out of 2x 1 TB WD Blue WD10EZEX (currently one replaced with a 2 TB Crucial MX500)\n\n* Smart Response Technology in Enhanced acceleration mode using 1x 128 GB Crucial MX100\n\n* New drives are 2x 2 TB Crucial MX500 (currently one replacing one of the WD Blues)\n\n* Windows 7 (patched up to date)",

I installed the cpu and it is working at stock clocks, I can push it slightly to 5.7 all core in R24 and it is stable. but as soon as I try to push beyond that I get stability issues that are not consistent. I purchased the rocketcool ihs and while installing it noticed that the SMD that is circled in the picture (linked below) is missing. The pads are perfect, like they were cleaned. Im 100% certain I did not knock it off Ive delided several cpus and am very careful when handling delicate components. I am assuming the guy who sold it to me scamed me...

        "content": "If you are using a laptop with Intel 12th generation and later processors, especially i9 processors, you can try installing [GamePP](https://www.gamepp.com/index/index/download/)(If you don't trust this Chinese software, you can use Intel XTU or HWInfo to see the throttling reason) and then play any game for a while and then exit the game to check the performance report, there is a throttling report in the upper right corner of the performance report, open it and if you see a lot of red parts and the reason for the throttling is written as \"IA: Electrical Design Point/Other\", then it is because of the current limit/PL4 power limit that caused the CPU to throttle.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to know that IA: Electrical Design Point/Other is not just about hitting the current limit, it is also about triggering the Peak Power Consumption (PL4) limit. I don't intend to talk much about current limits. Perhaps your laptop is throttling due to current limit, which might be triggered because the manufacturer intentionally locked the maximum current limit in the EC (Embedded Controller) and BIOS to restrict performance and extend the product's lifespan. In this case, flashing a modded BIOS and EC might resolve the issue. It could also be due to the laptop's insufficient power delivery units. Unless you physically add more power delivery units, the problem of frequently triggering the current limit cannot be resolved.\n\nI am planning to talk more about PL4 power limit. Before discussing PL4, it's important to understand the concept of Potential Peak Power (PPP). PPP is the theoretically highest power consumption calculated by Intel\u2018s algorithm. When the CPU starts turbo boosting, it estimates the PPP. Since PPP is an estimated value, it doesn't actually represent that much power consumption; it seems more like a prediction of the potential instantaneous power consumption of the system. When the PPP exceeds the PL4 limit, the CPU frequency is forcibly reduced to prevent \"overload\".\n\nIntel's PPP algorithm appears to have issues similar to the recent eTVB problems in desktop chips that have gone unnoticed for a long time. Even when the CPU's current power consumption is very low, like around 20-30 watts, PPP may estimate the upcoming peak power consumption to be over several hundred watts. If the estimated value exceeds the PL4 limit, then CPU will be throttled.\n\nMicro-Star International has conducted some tests, and using the 13980HX as an example, they found that only setting PL4 to at least 400 watts can prevent throttling due to EDP/Other. The suspected underlying reason is that the PPP algorithm predicts that when one core triggers turbo boost, all other cores will also reach their maximum turbo frequencies. This causes the estimated peak power consumption to become extremely high, and if this estimated value exceeds the PL4 limit, throttling occurs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5odl193gu7d1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ea1e8bacce1541ab969eb40554f82e17bdfe81\n\nTranslated from Chinese by ChatGPT & DeepL, I'm not a native English speaker",

            "it might be working as intended. power delivery is not perfect, and software is giving your CPU hints/have queues that can allow you to accurately predict power overshoot. Alderlake-based cores can already use as much power as you're willing to throw at them, and it's not rare to spike 50%+ above your power target when attempting to boost quickly. \n\nPL4 is meant to a complete cutoff point, even if the cutoff is only for a 10 millisecond power spike. So you might be seeing 20~30w at the time, but the next boost ramp may demand a huge amount of power for a tiny period of time over multiple cores to hit the boost target at the latency required, making PL4 preemptively throttle to protect the chip and keep power draw stable. The peak could be so fast that you don't see it in software readouts.",
            "Intel doesn't define PL4, it's not even required to be implemented since it's mainly for laptops.  \n\nThe purpose of PL4 is to define the maximum amount of power that can be delivered by the Battery/Charger.",
            "I am pretty blown away by the AI translator. It was nearly perfect.",
            "Nice try GamePP dev.",
            "Most of the issues with mobile chips are power limitations due to cooling issues, most laptops makes cheap out on VRMs and cooling setups. Thats why mobile cheap can\u2019t handle the power properly without throttling.",
            "It\u2019s it operating over base clock? Then it\u2019s working as expected, it can boost up to X depending on many factors",
            "How convenient. When I was helping with benchmarks for the Coreboot port (Dasharo) for the MSI Z690-A (Desktop, not mobile related), I recall that Intel XTU reported on a 12600K some Current throttling that made absolutely no sense, and the source was never identified (It should still do so even on latest release). But I do recall that Dasharo has PL4 configured (ThrottleStop reported a value for it) whereas MSI always ran it at 0 (Unlimited). If I stop being lazy, I could try to reproduce this.",
            "are you able to test if increasing the cooling affects the limit",
            "The sort of behavior I'm seeing with alder & raptor lake laptops that come at my shop is below. Let's say you start a full system scan on Defender.\n\n* begins with all P + E cores at full. The initial \"turbo\" ends in 2-5 minutes (depending on laptop) (Task Manager 80%)\n* shuts off most E cores while P cores stay, and a thread runs round-robin on any 1 E core. ends in maybe 1-2 minutes (Task Manager 30%)\n* shuts off all E cores and P cores drop to 2 in round-robin threads. stays for most of scan duration (Task Manager 10%)\n* the 2 threads on P core further reduce their utilization to some 10-20% till the end of scan (Task Manager 7%)\n\nNow interesting observations:\n\n* this has nothing to do with SSD & CPU temperatures, why should it keep going down despite having cooled is definitely not the behaviour seen in pre E-core CPUs.\n* right after the above scan / task is done, it springs back to full utility when relaunching new task / scan. This proves that temperature is not at play, and the scheduler algorithm(s) are to blame."
