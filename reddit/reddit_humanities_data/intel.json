Also ensure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 many modern Intel motherboards should have BIOS flashback, allowing you to update the BIOS without needing the CPU or RAM installed, please consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure can very depending on the make and model. When utilising BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less, some implementations of BIOS flashback do not work well with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives larger than 8GB\n\n* If you are using a high-end RX 6000, RX 7000, RTX 30 or RTX 40 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6/8pin PCIe cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these might not be able to supply adequate power \u2014 some GPUs have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough or consistent power, please consult your GPU and PSU manual on how to correctly connect your GPU\n\n* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, some motherboards will not start if the RAM is installed in the secondary DIMM slots \u2014 the primary slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual\n\n* Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard \u2014 if this still doesn't work, try a different TV or Monitor and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest updates for your operating system, games and applications: these updates can help resolve many bugs and compatibility issues, especially with newer hardware or software\n\n* Scan your PC for any Viruses or Malware using Windows Defender or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution \u2014 Malware, Viruses, Adware and other unwanted software can cause security, stability and compatibility issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) and reinstall them. To reinstall GPU drivers and software, we recommend using [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit). To reinstall chipset, ME and other Intel drivers, we recommend letting Windows Update do them or by acquiring the latest from your system/motherboard vendors website\n\n* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG, Xbox, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using. Instructions can be found online for your respective game client \u2014 corrupt and/or missing files can cause games not to launch, crash and experience other performance and stability issues\n\n* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values.\n\n* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller \u2014 corrupt or missing files can cause programs to not launch, crash or experience other issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability\n\n* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or similar\n\n* Stability test your system with the utilities linked below if you experience crashes, freezes, system shut-down or just want to check \u2014 just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable. Many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it\n\n---\n\n[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/) \u2014 Ocbase is the home of OCCT, the most popular all-in-one stability / stress testing / benchmarking / monitoring tool available for PC.\n\n[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.\n\n[AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 System Stability Test uses a 64-bit multi-threaded stress testing module to drive the computer to its absolute limits. Hard disk, SSD and OpenCL GPGPU video adapter stress testing is also available.\n\n[Furmark](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/) \u2014 FurMark is a lightweight but very intensive graphics card / GPU stress test on Windows platform.\n\n[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance.\n\n[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.\n\n[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests.\n\n[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) \u2014 SeaTools - Quick diagnostic tool that checks the health of your drive.\n\nFor more advanced SSD/HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD/HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer specialised software to test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive.\n\nSome motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.\n\nA truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks/undervolts. \n\nIf you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.\n\n---\n\n* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current or future PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculator and make sure the PSU you have can output enough power when your system is under a full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system crashes when under load.\n\n* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html), [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator), [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/), [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/), [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator), [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator), you can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage\n\n* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit)\n\n* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...\n\n* If you've tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please backup any important data and completely reinstall your operating system \u2014 we recommend using the latest official ISO image available. **The use of utilities which modify Windows or using 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images can cause stability, security and compatibility issues**. For this reason, please use an official Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO image direct from Microsoft. We would also recommend performing a clean install with a USB. Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download)\n\nIf you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'cod crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough information to go on.**\n\n*Below is an example template you could use...*\n\n---\n\n**Summary of issue**: Graphical glitches when playing 'Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora' on 31.0.101.4972 if you have V-Sync enabled. This can be resolved if you revert to 31.0.101.4953.\n\n**What I have tried**: I have reinstalled 31.0.101.4972 with DDU, reset my in-game graphics settings, verified game files in Ubisoft Connect and confirmed issues is still present.\n\n**System Specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Windows 11 22H2, OS Build 22631.2715 (to find OS build version, press the Windows Key + R and type *winver*)\n* CPU: Intel Core\u2122 i5-13400F\n* CPU Cooler: DeepCool AK620 with included paste and both fans\n* GPU: Intel Arc A750 8GB Limited Edition\n* Motherboard: MPG B760M EDGE TI WIFI with 7E11v12 BIOS\n* RAM: Corsair DOMINATOR Titanium 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 w/ XMP \n* Storage: 4TB Seagate FireCuda 530 with Heatsink\n* PSU: MSI MPG A850G 850W ATX 3.0\n* Display: 27\" Samsung Odyssey G32A 1080p 165Hz with included DisplayPort cable\n\nFeel free to include any log files, dump files, videos, screenshots or images to assist others in understanding the issue.\n\n---",

            "The frequencies on my i9-14900k seem to be going way out of bounds. Depending on the tool I'm using to measure the frequency... well, I won't share the ultra high end results, but I'll say of the tools I've used, \\`turbostat\\` (created by Intel) provides the lowest frequency values and those are 6221 MHz for the P-cores and 4938 MHz for the E-cores, which is kind of crazy. I'm worried not only about instability, but also voltage spikes.\n\nThoughts? Advice?",

The problem is I got this specific CPU off warranty because my previous 13th gen i9 was throwing faults and causing my computer to crash. So I'm not sure if it's possible for a warranty case to be issued a bad CPU because maybe Intel tests the replacement CPU to make sure that it's good?
