Gives added benefits to food and water, good for inventory management. \n\nPack Rat is downright **essential**, avoid it if you want some additional challenge on managing inventory \n\nAlso, be a drunk! \n\nLevel 4, 45 Survival and 6 END can net you the **Old World Gourmet** perk, which enables **Booze Healing** \n\nHealing from booze comes in clutch in hardcore mode. \n\nPlus, with a high survival skill, you'll ve able to make some funky drinks at a fireplace... Like Wasteland Tequillas. \n\nEven if you have 10 Intellegence, a high survival skill enables you to make drinks that can get your Int down to 3 or Lower.... so you can literally drink yourself stupid and access Low Intelligence Dialogue Checks while you're at it. \n\nPremium role playing.",

            "It's not substantially harder.  The only differences for me were: \n\nI had to consider load out and manage weight, especially ammunition weight. \n\nMy companions needed more looking after.\n\nI had to make sure I carried food and water.  \n\nUse stimpacks a bit before you're about to die if you get in a tough fight and need healing.  \n\nCarry a doctor bag or two for leg injuries.  Mind traps more to avoid leg injuries.\n\nKnow where there is easy to access free water or bed when map traveling.  Hit those spots in between you and your destination.  Hit up the food vendors too.",
            "You're gonna be setting up minor homes I imagine.  Novak is great because you van get a bed that does heal you pretty early and it's decent hub of stuff.  The workb3nch there has everything for like 2 or 3 weapon repair kits.  Survival will be your best friend and repair it's close second.",
            "It\u2019s honestly not THAT much different than normal imo. You just have to actually use consumables rather than sell them all. \nI was intimated by it but now I\u2019ll probably never play non hardcore again.",
            "Keep your companions kitted out and out of danger. Save often. And if you're going through a particularly dangerous area, have them wait and scout ahead. Others have given great tips. I'd say just watch the weight from ammo. Oh, and doctors bags are important. In my opinion, hardcore is the way to play and I wish all the \"Bethesda\" games had it. Really makes you engage with systems you typically wouldn't in normal if you're not roleplaying.",
            "Remember that your companions can die; my first time playing hardcore, ED-E died within minutes of becoming my companion because I forgot about this.",
