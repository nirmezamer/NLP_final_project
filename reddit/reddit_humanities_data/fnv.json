The workb3nch there has everything for like 2 or 3 weapon repair kits.  Survival will be your best friend and repair it's close second.",
            "Its honestly not THAT much different than normal imo. You just have to actually use consumables rather than sell them all. \nI was intimated by it but now Ill probably never play non hardcore again.",
            "Keep your companions kitted out and out of danger. Save often. And if you're going through a particularly dangerous area, have them wait and scout ahead. Others have given great tips. I'd say just watch the weight from ammo. Oh, and doctors bags are important. In my opinion, hardcore is the way to play and I wish all the \"Bethesda\" games had it. Really makes you engage with systems you typically wouldn't in normal if you're not roleplaying.",

            "Apply the Skyrim logic. Become a stealth archer(sniper) who crams loads of food into your face to heal. Desert salad, bloatfly sliders and bitter drink are life savers and easy to get. Go to Big MT early and get the ability to print all the stimpack and healing items you need with the SINKs robots plus it takes 2 potential crippled limbs away. Memorize the ingredients to healing poultice and make a bunch of them in Zion as well. Theyre like doctors bags but lighter and offer healing as well",
            "its not like fallout 4 its a pretty easy mode",
            "The biggest difference in Hardcore mode isn't the healing over time, or maintaining food/water/drink, it's that you can no longer lug 50k rounds of ammunition with you everywhere you go, and instead have to actually think about your loadout. I hate weightless ammo, and it's the main reason I always play on hardcore."
