            "Having the belts not as separate things will be a HUGE improvement. And handing over stuff to the GPU is good news as well. I would love to have my GPU do more of the work.\n\nSo the CPU will be less of the bottleneck. Not having issues with speed yet, but I imagine that will happen.\n\nThe cutting of grass not happening is a good thing.\n\nTo be honest, I do not care about the load times. This is not a game that I play for 10 minutes. So it bothers me less. It is nice if it is faster, but if not, meh. Same for save times. I had 2.5 minutes in my previous save. Not an issue, as I set mine to 1 hour.\n\nI believe that 5 minutes autosave with only 3 autosaves is not a good thing as solving an issue takes easy longer than 15 minutes and then all your autosaves are overwritten. So either go for longer times by default or more autosaves, or both.\n\nBut optimisation id often not a bad thing.\n\nThanks Snutt. Helps a lot.",
            "**Fantastic Game News**\n\nI love to hear information about game getting improvements and this video will make Pioneers very happy.\n\nWHAT IS IN VIDEO\n\n* [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIKjR5jVv9Y) - Opening comments by Snutt.\n* [Embracer Announcement](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=40) - Snutt talks about [this press release](https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-about-the-transformation-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities/) which describes the reorganization of Embracer Group, which owns Coffee Stain Holding, which owns Coffee Stain Studios (CSS).\n   * Embracer Group is splitting up into 3 separate companies.\n   * **The reorganization is not expected to affect CSS, nor the Satisfactory Game Development or Version 1.0 Release.**\n* [State of Development](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=106) - Snutt talked about the Closed Beta, currently ongoing. They have had about 1000 Closed Beta Participants playing and overall the feedback has been positive.\n   * Any issues or bugs are being noted and will be addressed during Gold Stage (Game Polishing) prior to release of Version 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Game Optimizations in Version 1.0**\n\n* [Intro / Key Note](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=157) - Performance is directly tied to your Game PC stats and so while some might see performance improvements, others perhaps not so much.\n* [Foliage](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=191) - The \"colliders\" for various types of Foliage will be removed from Vehicles, which means you can't destroy *most smaller foliage* by driving a Vehicle over them.\n   * This change will improve performance on Dedicated Servers by reducing the amount of RAM used.\n   * This change will also improve level streaming and reduce stuttering.\n   * Foliage that requires at least a Chainsaw to remove will be still be able to be destroyed by running over with a Vehicle.\n   * Determining what Foliage is destroyed, and what is not destroyed, by a Vehicle is still being tweaked.\n* [Belts and Pipelines](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=289) - In Version 1.0 all Belt (and Pipeline) individual segments will be \"pooled\" into one [instance group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) or \"pool\" thereby reducing the CPU computational load.\n   * This means that both Belts and Pipelines will part of bigger \"instance pools\", reducing the number of instances to be checked, and will be more reliant on the GPU to do most of the computational heavy lifting.\n   * [Shadow Rendering](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=328) will improve because like Belts and Pipelines, shadows will also use bigger instance pools allowing for faster computation.\n   * Manifolds, which are often made up of multiple belt segments, will benefit from this change of using bigger \"instance pools\" by reducing the computational load needed.\n   * The use of Nanite on Belts was tested, but the final decision was to use the bigger instance pool method. **Nanite for Belts and Pipelines will not be used.**\n* [Lightweight Actors](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=373) - Certain Buildable's that don't produce items, nor are interacted with by the Player, are being converted into \"Data Only Objects\".\n   * Common examples of \"Data Only Objects\" are Foundations, Walls, Railings, Stairs, etc.\n   * In Version 1.0 (and after) they will only store crucial information, like location, graphic mesh, customization data (colors, materials, etc.), and the recipe used to build them.\n   * Since all this \"Data Only Objects Data\" will be stored in a single location in memory, writing it to your Game Save will be faster which means Autosave \"delays\" and Manual Save times will be shorter.\n   * Additionally Load Times will be faster, and Save Files will be smaller.\n   * Also this will improve Multiplayer as it decreases the amount of data that needs to be shared resulting in Clients being able to join quicker.\n* [Memory Optimization](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=521) - By removing unneeded data, or old test data, and other stuff, will lower the VRAM requirements for everyone.\n* [Scalability](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=542) - Making changes from a lower setting to a higher setting, or vice-versa, were improved.\n* [Unreal Engine 5.3](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=556) - Version 1.0 will be using Unreal Engine 5.3. This will result in some performance improvements due to Epic fixing some issues in UE 5.2, and also had the benefit of fixing some game crashes that Players were experiencing.\n   * [**Unreal Engine 5.4**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available) **will not be used in Version 1.0** but *may be considered in a future Update.*\n* [Upgraded Upscaler's](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=589) - Both Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), and AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution (FSR) have been upgraded to their respective latest versions.\n* [Dedicated Servers](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=602) - In a [previous video](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1bqp8mj/comment/kx4migg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *(Video Bookmarks)* the  improvements to Dedicated Servers in Version 1.0 were discussed, but when it comes to optimizations, in addition to the changes to Foliage, Belts and Pipelines mentioned earlier, Dedicated Servers will also now have the ability to do level streaming\n   * This means you don't need everything on the Map loaded all the time which means if you have a group of Co-Op friends all grouped in one area only, then only *that part of the Map* is loaded.\n* [More Optimizations Planned](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=651) - In addition to those optimizations mentioned in this video, more are planned between before Version 1.0 is released.\n* [Q&A: How About More Videos?](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=660) - Due to Closed Beta and lots of other behind-the-scene efforts videos have been slow to release, but that is expect to change in the near future.\n* [SHOCKING: No Beany Cap / Outro](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=689) - Snutt realized he did not wear his normal Beany Cap.\n   * *That explains why I was confused whom was talking.* \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks Snutt, this helped a lot. \ud83d\ude01",
            "Oh man, if this improves save times, that's huge. I had to turn autosave way down because it just took so much time.",
            "Great to hear about all of the optimizations. The impact the foliage collision change has on vram is impressive should make anyone with 8GB cards very happy.\n\nThe cpu performance and save file improvements will be nice hopefully this means that save game stutter/lag will be much less noticeable until hopefully late game. \n\nMy only wish is that they would give us a hint on release date.  I have been holding off on starting a new save but if I know 1.0 will not be out until Q4 I would probably start a new game vs. if 1.0 is going to come out in late Q2 or early Q3.",
            "Who\u2019s this guy? I want beanie snutt",
            "The changes to belts and pipes are interesting.  I do wonder if that has the potential to introduce new and subtle maths problems though?  I know other developers who've looked at moving some calculations from the CPU to the GPU, but decided against it due to accuracy problems. I think that might have been a lack of support for double (rather than single) precision data types though, which I'd doubt that games use anyway for performance reasons.\n\nHopefully this is thoroughly tested and any new glitches are caught.  On the other hand perhaps the focus on those calculations will have helped sort out some of the previous problems, so I guess it could also be a benefit.  I also wonder if calculating the belts as a single entity might help avoid the slight glitch in item movement that can occur at joins?",
            "\"If you've ever used belts...\"\n\nWait...this game has conveyor belts? Damn I guess I've been playing wrong.",
            "They can improve the save time all they want - I\u2019ll just build more factory until it sucks again!",
            "*looks at comments*. Who would have thought a bunch of satisfactory players would be so excited about optimization? :D",
            "Glad to hear about the load/save times, one of my biggest complaints! Can't wait :)"

Snutt mentioned there were changes to Resource Nodes, rebalancing existing recipes, and has information about progression and existing Game Saves.\n\n* [Version 1.0 Release Date?](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=40) - We will find out soon. They do plan on announcing it well in advance, so stay tuned.\n\n* [Changes To Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=70) - There will be **a lot of NEW Resource Nodes** and there has been *alterations to existing Resource Nodes* which have been either moved, changed purity level, and **some current Resource Nodes will be GONE in Version 1.0.**\n\n   * They have been wanting to make these changes for quite some time, but waited for Gold Stage (game polish) to implement them so as to not mess up existing factories.\n\n* [Specific Node Changes / Northern Forest Biome Warning](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=108) - Snutt talks about specific Resource Node changes, and mentions **a lot happen in the *Northern Forest Biome***.\n\n   * [Northern Forest Pure Node Bonanza No More](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=132) - The \"Pure Node Bonanza\" that *was* on the Northwest edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* **is being dismantled** with some moved, some given Purity Level changes, and some just plain gone.\n\n* [Sulfur Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=157) (See Map) - The three Sulfur Nodes have changed with one removed and the two remaining changed to Impure Nodes. Additionally two other Normal Sulfur Nodes from *Snake Tree Forest Biome* and *Swamp Biome* have been removed, but **MORE New Sulfur Nodes** have been added.\n\n* [Caterium Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=195) (See Map) - Mostly the same as now. The *Northern Forest Biome* Caterium Node has been removed, and another Caterium Node close by has been moved slightly. Additional Caterium Nodes have been removed from Western **Jungle Spires Biome**, *Desert Canyons Biome* and the *Swamp Biome*. \n\n   * The *Swamp Biome* will now get a new cluster of 3 Sulfur Nodes (1 Pure, 2 Normal).\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Caterium Nodes** have been added.\n\n* [Quartz Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=228) (See Map) - A lot of the Quartz Nodes in the *Titan Forest Biome* have been removed and replaced by 1 Pure Node and 2 Normal Nodes also in the *Titan Forest Biome*.\n\n   * The 2 Pure Quartz Nodes on the Western edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* have also been removed and replaced by 2 impure nodes more centrally located within the Northern Forest Biome*.\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Quartz Nodes** (1 Pure, 1 Normal, 1 Impure) have been added to the *Southern Forest Biome.*  \n\n* [Changes to Purity Levels of Other Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=262) - In addition to the changes to Sulfur, Caterium, and Quartz, there have been changes to *other Resource Nodes* with most of the changes being moving Nodes from Normal to Impure Purity.\n\n* [Changes to Coal](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=275) (See Map) - Snutt talks about changes made to Coal Nodes, with removal of Pure Coal Node in Northwest edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* and two Normal Coal Nodes in the *Eastern Dune Forest Biome*.\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Coal Nodes** have been added to extreme Northwest *Rocky Desert Biome*, along with *Jungle Spires Biome*, and a **extreme amount of Coal Nodes** added to the *Dune Forest Biome*.\n\n* [Iron, Copper, and Limestone Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=309) (See Map) - Snutt mentions large sections of the Map have been sprinkled with **MORE New Nodes** *(which was not discussed).*\n\n   * Three Normal Iron Nodes in the *Titan Forest Biome* have been removed and replaced by a cluster of 3 Normal Iron Nodes.\n\n* \ud83d\udea9 [Geyser Changes Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=338) (See Map) - Snutt talks about changes to Geysers *(used for* [*Geothermal Power Generators*](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Geothermal_Generator#Usage)*)*. Nothing was removed, however **MORE Geysers have been added all over the Map** meaning *Geothermal Power can be a viable consideration for Power Generation.*\n\n   * They increased total number of Geysers from 18 to **30**\n\n* [Uranium Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=352) - Mikael steps in to discuss Uranium Nodes. The Normal Uranium Node in the *Swamp Biome Cave* is being nerfed down to a Impure Node.\n\n   * Additionally **a NEW Impure Uranium Node** has been added to the *Dune Desert Plateau Sub-Biome*.\n\n* [Bottom Line - You have MORE Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=382) - Snutt emphasizes that overall there will now be MORE Resource Nodes *of every type* despite all the changes.\n\n   * \u2605 [View All Resource Node Change Maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S2oJxzkoVoFhBPzqgZc9ted9GoeUDK0R) (Google Drive).\n\n* [Recipe Changes - Super Computers](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=405) - Super Computers will no longer be part of the MAM Caterium Research Tree, and no longer needed to make Programmable Splitters or Geothermal Power Generators which will instead need AI Limiters and High-Speed Connectors respectfully to enable use of Geothermal Power Generators on all those new Geysers added. *Mikael jumped in to correct Snutt*.\n\n* [Reasons Why Recipe Changes Were Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=459) - Snutt mentions that the made changes to allow those in Early Game to Mid Game have access to some of the \"fun\" stuff, and to make their use more of a consideration for Factories.\n\n* [QoL Changes Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=487) - Snutt talks about several QoL changes made:\n   * The Gas Mask will now will be unlocked in the MAM Mycelia Research Tree instead of Tier 5.\n   * The Jetpack will be available in Tier 5, Milestone 1 and will not required Oil Production.\n   * Tier 6, Milestone 1 will now include the Truck instead of the Fuel Generator which was moved to a **new Milestone** *(unnamed)*.\n   * \ud83d\udea9 BIG CHANGE is that Trains and and Fuel Generators will no longer require Computers or Heavy Modular Frames making them accessible without using a Manufacturer.\n   * \u2605 Heavy Modular Frames are no longer used for Buildings in Tier 5 and early Tier 6, and Computers are not used in early Tier 6, both of which will be used to unlock items in Tier 7.\n   * Also Circuit Boards and Electromagnetic Control Rods are NOT used to **unlock** Buildings, or anything for that matter, *but will still be used in Recipes.*\n\n---\n\n**Continued on additional Reply Comment below** \u2b07",
