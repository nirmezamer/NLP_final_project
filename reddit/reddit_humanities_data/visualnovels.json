            "Anyone have recommendations for buying physical copies of visual novels in Japan?",
            "I just finished Soukoku no Aterial (Aterial of Origin) by Eushully a few weeks ago, and I loves it. Is there any game that have the similar theme:\n\n- Little sister heroine\n\n- Angel heroine (preferably also design by Yukari)\n\n- In English, of course.\n\n- Preferably free, or at least the price must match the quality of the game.\n\nMany thanks",
            "Can you recommend a VN with some cute romance? Preferrably one that ends happily.",
            "I am interested in Aselia The Eternal and was looking into it and it's sequel on Vndb when I noticed there is a third game in production which is quite surprising. Is it coming out any time soon? Do we know much about it? Does the second game leave on any sort of non conclusive ending that leads into this elusive third game? Theres really not much to go off with the Vndb description and linked website which won't even load for me for some reason.",
            "How can I play windows only VNs from itch on Linux?\n\nThere are many that are Linux compatible, but some that I want to play are only available for windows.\n\nI was dual booting with Win 7 and used the windows partition for such games, however, I recently got a new hard drive and installed Linux Mint by itself. I attempted to use Wine a long time ago, but failed and never tried again.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do this?",
            "My post got auto deleted because its my first time posting here, so I'll ask my question in this thread (their suggestion lol)  \n  \nWhile trying to finish up RIDDLE JOKER, I realized that its already been 1 year and 4 months since I started playing it. I started March 2023 lol.  \nNow I'm almost done with it. with just the secret route left.\n\nBack in my student days, I can finish a visual novel in 3 months max. But now as a working adult, there are just some days where I cant even open the game...\n\nMaybe its work, or maybe I'm just getting lazy, or maybe I'm just losing interest in visual novels all together.  \nAnd this is what gave me the idea to ask you all the question:  \n**What is the visual novel that took you longest to finish? And Why?**\n\nAnd yes, its to make me feel better, cause I really miss the days when I can finish VNs in 3 month lol.  \nAnd with how bad my memory is, whenever I stop playing a VN for too long, I sometimes end up forgetting the plot. So before I continue reading, I force myself to remember the plot by reading the last few lines of the previous save state I had (I make a different save file each time just for this lol)",
            "As someone who\u2019s never played a VN, what do recommend me?  \n\n\nMy friend plays quite a lot of visual novels and wants me to get into them. I\u2019m interested (there\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m trying to make a VN and want to surprise them) but what should I start with? \n\nRecommend me anything, I have no boundaries. Actually, as long as it\u2019s english. Give me a recommendation and tell me why I should play (I probably will play anyways regardless because I like surprise lmao) a short synopsis would be nice.",
            "Hi everyone! I'm new on Reddit so i don't really know how to use it, I'll try to reply to all of you though if i can figure out how to hahaha\n\nI'm looking for visual novels, since they're one of my favorite kinds of games. I generally like mystery/detective/horror/folk horror and I tend to dislike slice of life/anything too porn-y, as it bores me to death.\n\nHere are some games I've really enjoyed:\n- Gnosia\n- Paranormasight\n- Raging Loop\n- P5 royal\n- All the Zero Escape/999... and whatnot\n- Danganronpa\n- Amnesia\n- Phoenix Wright\n- Doki Doki\n\n(Ive tried 428 Shibuya Scramble and disliked it, along with The Letter and Spirit Hunter, the atmosphere created in SH wasn't scary at all and the lewd art really took me out of the whole horror)",

A new thread is posted every Thursday at 4:00 AM JST (or Wednesday if you don't live in Japan for some reason).\n\nGood WAYR entries include your analysis, predictions, thoughts, and feelings about what you're reading. The goal should be to stimulate discussion with others who have read that VN in the past, or to provide useful information to those reading in the future! Avoid long-winded summaries of the plot, and also avoid simply mentioning which VNs you are reading with no points for discussion. The best entries are both **brief** and **brilliant**.\n\n**Use spoiler tags liberally!**\n\nAlways use spoiler tags in threads that are not about one specific visual novel. Like this one!\n\n* They can be posted using the following markdown: \\>!hidden spoilery text!< , which shows up as >!hidden spoilery text!<. Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning and end of the spoiler tag because this will break it for users on [http://old.reddit.com/](http://old.reddit.com/).

            "[White Album 2](https://vndb.org/v7771) is so freaking sad man. I'm having to alternate between it and Majikoi so I don't get depressed. I watched the anime almost a decade ago and I remember liking it, so I decided to read the VN since I heard the anime only covered the prologue.\nJust finished IC, so I'm officially spoiler free from now on. I just want to give Setsuna a hug.",
            "I just finished\u00a0[Symphonic Rain](https://vndb.org/v38). First of all, what a great OST.\u00a0*Subarashii*, from start to finish the openings, the training of the songs, the endings, the arrangements, the voices, everything. I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nThe setting felt like that of a classic European romance, more so with the constant rain. It might be a matter of personal taste, but I found it to be a great place for the world of magic instruments. The mini-game grew on me more and more. In the end, I was playing some of the songs, although on easy levels. The lyrics of the songs, each with the character's sense, I found that to be great too.\n\n>!Even though I expected the final happy ending, it was still enjoyable.!<\u00a0I loved that the characters weren't black and white, that the darker side was shown in different forms.\u00a0>!Considering the MC's state, Fal's ending made a lot more sense to me.!<\u00a0Phorni was such a charming character.\n\nI guess there were a couple of things that could liked different. >!Essentially, the story has a clear direction, but I think it could have been a little longer, and the sadder endings could have been more complex in their development and perhaps shown different \"happy\" aspects in them as well, the opposite applies for the happy ending.\u00a0!<Above all, I leave with a comfortable note and feeling from this VN. I didn't know much about it, thought it would be a lighter story, but it ended up surprising me a lot.",
            "Since Fate is getting a rerelease soon, I thought it was a great opportunity to read [Mahoyo](https://vndb.org/v777). So I finished it yesterday, and it was pretty good. However, my biggest complaint with it is that the pacing of the first half is awful. And don't get me started with Chapter 5. It dragged on way too long than necessary and felt like most of the scenes were them mostly running around. Everything before Chapter 9, the story seemed rather laid back and not much of a high stake. Soujuurou is super weird but he is so unintentionally funny. It was only after Chapter 9 that the \"good\" part I was waiting for finally came and that got me really into it. After finishing Mahoyo, I can't help but feel like certain parts of the story felt \"uncooked\". Like there were some things they didn't bother touching on again and some shit I frankly didn't understand. Either way, I still enjoyed it and I got a huge appetite to consume more fate stuff again. Probably should check out the Kara no Kyoukai novels",
            "Just finished [Rance 2 kai](https://vndb.org/v18970). The plot was fun since it is impossible to get bored since Rance gimmicks always makes me burst out laughing. I didn't really like the gameplay that much, but it didn't bother me that much since the game is really short it took me only 12 hours to finish it and I raised both Rance and Sill to level 41 + all Cgs.\n\nOverall it was and entertaining game and it was an important entry to understand the origins of Shizuku and Maria and other characters that will shown up in the later games:\n\nscore: 6.5/10",
            "[Shiniyuku sequel](https://vndb.org/v49274). It\u2019s been one hell of a ride and idk if this will be an unpopular opinion but it\u2019s been a lot better/more interesting than the 1st. There have been some routes that were pretty :/, but there was 2 major routes that were so emotional and high tension that if the game was just those 2 routes (I still need to do True End route and Furon ending) I might give it a 10/10.",
            "[removed]",
            "i finished [subarashiki hibi](https://vndb.org/v3144) (my favorite piece of media by quite a margin now) and have started [umineko](https://vndb.org/v24) (played thru the opening sequence & theme song, not far in at all)",
            "I'm replaying [Dungeon of Regalias](https://vndb.org/v18761). The gameplay is very simple and basic, but fun enough. The OST seems pretty average, though. The female cast is sweet. But I don't like the MC. He's 99% a horndog who let his dick to the thinking. And if his dick says \"Yes\", he doesn't care about when, where and the \"partners\" opinion in 99% of cases. Though he doesn't rape, it felt her and there rather \"manipulative\"? Telling just the things the partner wants to hear in order to get it on, or the woman is \"resisting\" but not really rejecting the advances + the actual act. You know the deal XD. And of course he's the absolute \"sex god\" in terms of szie and technique. But the latter seems to be the status quo for Astronau Sirius MCs. \n\nAlso been replaying Kyonyuu Fantasy 2+4. Still liking them, though I feel the final victory felt quite eyebrow-raising in 2. In 4, I thought it happened mostly because the enemy country/army was portrayed in a very binary ligh. >!Like Gunevia might have never become a General, but if the enemy soldiers would't have kicked the corpses of her fallen brethern, she had probably been more hesitant in switching to Astor's side, whereas everyone on Astor's side imediately trusts her incl. the MC of course + her plan that lead ultimately to victory.!<\n\nI kinda wish that KF5 doesn't use too much of the early \"abusive\" superiors like the 2 dudes whose names get  mispronounced frequently. I also wouldn't mind if the MC would start out on average standing instead of the very bottom just to lightly spice things up.",
            "okay [Totono](https://vndb.org/v7738)'s nsfw stuff was great until (SPOILERS) >!miyuki breaks the third wall to have sex with us the reader and clings on the idea that the reader would own a penis!< It was just not relatable at all and I couldn't skip it so I was just sitting there like a duck\ud83d\ude2d\u2620\ufe0f",
            "Just finished [Muv-Luv Alternative ](https://vndb.org/v92)last night and now that I've fully digested it, what a fucking experience the Muv-Luv trilogy has been. I went in completely blind to everything except for the critically acclaimed status of Alternative. Feel like its very hard to explain but Alternative kept on subverting my expectations of what was going to happen, but delivering even more. It exceeded my expectations when I expected it to kick right into the action instantly. But it didn't, it continued to build up the plot and lay way for an unforgettable final 3 chapters. \n\nI don't have many gripes if any. I adored Extra and Unlimited which made Alternative all the more special, especially when growing so attached to the characters. They are all deeply flawed and remained flawed till the end, but that just made it more endearing. Hell of an experience."
