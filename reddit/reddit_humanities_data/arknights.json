            "i really enjoy arknights. although i haven't been reading the story, i watch recap videos and thoroughly enjoy the world building, the character designs, music, and generally tower defense is fun. \n\nthe struggle i am having is i am so bad at the game, that it feels like i'm wasting my time even though i'm having fun if that makes sense. i think i've gotten better, but because i feel the need to 3* every stage (especially the farming ones), the game feels incredibly unforgiving since 1 leak ruins it. this feeling gets to the point where i probably think quitting makes the most sense to save my time and irl sanity, but i don't want to quit!\n\ni'm a returning player who rerolled during the monster hunter collab so i'm only level 55ish, have chapter 9 unlocked and working on episode 7 now. even when watching guides, i struggle for some reason and CC clapping me when going for 200 didn't help either. \n\ndoes anyone else who felt or experienced this have any advice? idk. if i put this much thought into other things i'd probably be a giga genius but yeah, that's where i'm at... :(",

            "Hi everyone! Last week, when I just started playing, I posted in the thread asking for advice on the lineup. I am very grateful to everyone who replied to me then, including those who did so in private messages. It has been about a week since then, I have been playing for about 12 days in total now and wanted to ask for advice again if anyone would be kind to look at my lineup. I am probably still a newbie, I am going through chapter 4 now, but I have a much better understanding of the game than I did a week ago when I posted my initial post. And my roster has changed dramatically in less than a week; it is absolutely different from that time.\n\nBut first of all I wanted to make 3 clarifications.\n\n1. Although I do not have them in the main roster, according to the advice I received last week, I have developed enough 3-star players and have them in stock -- although I almost immediately replaced them with 4 and 5-star players. Contrary to the comments I received, I had a lot of resources to develop all of them. I was warned that as a newbie I would be short on resources, but I actually have a ton of resources -- money, chips, experience materials and resources to improve characters -  everything. I do not know what is wrong with me, but I do. So I do not complain about scarcity and I do not limit myself to developing 3 star characters.\n2. As I noted above, I have a lot of resources to develop characters immediately when/if someone can give me advice. I just have not done it yet and decided to ask the Reddit first.\n3. All characters on the screenshot have level 7 skills except Texas and Specter. They have level 6 for now but soon, maybe even this night, I will raise them to level 7 as well. So everything is ok about the skills.\n\n[Here is my main squad](https://imgur.com/a/4no7pBK)\n\n  \nSo, moving on to advice, I would appreciate any general comments, but I have specific questions as well.\n\nAll those characters who I have raised so far to Elite 1 level 50, I think, will stay with me if not forever but for a long time. But as for the 4 characters whom I just raised to Elite 1 without levelling up - La Pluma, Ptilopsis, Liskarm and Haze - I have doubts about the point of their development.\n\n1) La Pluma - I am really enjoying her, she saved me on many challenge mode levels in chapters 3 and 4 but I am not sure if I should keep her in the lineup for the future. I have been advised to have a Lord Guard as a second guard in addition to Specter, and so far, the only one I have of that type is Midnight, who is Elite 1 level 50. I will be looking to get Lappland, but do you think using Specter + La Pluma as two guards would be okay? Maybe I do not need any Lappland at all? Or if I do, I will develop her as a part of additional operators that I might need for some specific levels and not the main squad.\n\n2) Ptilopsis - I have 5 awesome medics, but none of them are ST healers. I have been advised not to use two AOE healers and have an ST healer. I will be targeting Warfarin but not sure if I will get her in the foreseeable future. So, for now, I am using two AOE healers, but I will probably have to replace one of them later. Do you think, if I get a good ST healer, should I replace Ptilopsis or Perfumer? I will have the resources, I think, to raise two five-star medics, and I am more interested in which of them will be better in general regardless of the development resources aspect. This will determine for me whether or not I should develop Ptilopsis.\n\n3) Liskarm - I love her, she really fits my playstyle. But it belongs to the weak category in the tier list. That said, I found in this subreddit that she is supposedly good in mid- and late-game, but that discussion was relatively old. Is she still considered good and should I develop her? Or forget about her and target someone else who is a more typical subclass among tanks?\n\n4) Haze is my biggest question and doubt. I like her as a character, her phrases and voiceover are my favourite after Specter. But in terms of gameplay, she seems very weak and just a worse version of Amiya not giving anything new. Is it worth developing her further or looking for a better caster? So far, this is the most problematic position for me. I have no one else but Gitano, but she is an AOE caster, which is not really welcomed, as I understand, and a 3-star character, if I recall correctly, Lava.\n\n5) From the last pools, I got Projekt Red. She seems to be considered a good character, but is too situational due to her class. Is she worth developing or is she useless in general?\n\nI would be very, very grateful if someone replies to my comment! I wish everyone a nice weekend and a fun game!",
