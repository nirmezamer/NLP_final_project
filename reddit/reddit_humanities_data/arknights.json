            "While Gamepress is down, where can I find the info on what materials are going to be farmed in the upcoming events? I\u2019m short on devices/kohl/RMA, and was wondering what should I shore up for the must-haves of the next few months.",
            "Hello, it looks like Degenbrecher deals a disgusting amount of damage, in AoE, lol. \n\nI've been wondering what's the loss of NOT going to e2 max mod3 and sticking to e2 60 mod1. It's not THAT much damage difference to cry over, right? She should still 1hko elites and even bosses with a little Warfarin shot. I think the difference would only be noticable off-skill.",
            "I tried restoring some assets today and found that a 298MB file is missing. I'm worried that such a large file loss might be misunderstood as 'intentional game data modification' and result in a false BAN. Does anyone here know a lot about Arknights' anti-cheat system? Do you think I\u2019ll get banned?",
            "For AoE casters and Ranged Aoe operators, how wide is the AoE exactly is it the tile in the middle and all 8 surrounding tiles? Or just the 1 tile, and every enemy in that 1 tile gets hit?"
