(Alam, Jkab, Alejo to name a few) So it makes it look like his only content was young boys, which is not true.\n\nThis not do defend a pedo psycho, but more to point out the issue in our community and those subscribing to his content specifically for the 18-21 boys content. The very same content that was shared and praised across the whole entertainment/content creator industry. And we know this type of content is popular because it\u2019s all anyone can talk about. \n\nFurther the fetishisation of daddy relationships that is affecting a lot of people in our community. There is probably a daily post of someone saying they prefer to date mature men and find their generation silly.\n\nSo let\u2019s use this opportunity to keep people we follow in check and follow up and research when people raise a concern instead of downvoting them. \n",

            "People are quick to judge, because pedophilia is a still an effective tool of our opponents to smear us with. That's why so many go on \"I don't know her!\", \"He's not with us!\" distance and do so quickly.",
            "I just hate this all so much because now hes a widely public figure in the gay community whose case will be used as ammunition by conservatives. Gay men and trans people are constantly fielding accusations from the right that we are hedonistic pedos. AW was not only disgusting for participating in what he did, but genuinely setting back our movement towards acceptance.",
            "Im not here to shame anyone. I can see your point of view on the community fetching daddy culture in the gay community. I personally dont like that part of the culture. You should be attracted to all ages and not just a specific type. I think its absolutely possible that the fbi did find the that content on his sf card.\n\nFBI has a lot of resources at their disposal just like any intelligence agency does. I do believe we shouldnt Glorify the culture of the daddy fetching. You are aloud to have your preference, some people in the community like it and others dont.  He shouldnt have that type of content on him at all. Child porn is unacceptable in any form.  I do say if he did do it (which I think he did do) he does need to go to jail.",
            "Im 100% against pedos. Honestly I think of my husband died and I had some mid life crisis I still couldnt date anyone under 25, but I still think theres a giant hypocrisy in which theres a lot of states where straight men can have sex with and marry women (girls) under 18, but they are quick to call a man who would do something similar a pedophile.",
            "I have many friends 35+ who regularly are sleeping with new local college students each year. Its always dead to me as predatory. Especially as someone who was assaulted by a man much older than me when I was 19.\n\nObviously, they can consent, but those of us over 25 know we werent fully formed people in those years. As a 31 year old I wont even go near anyone in their teens on a dating app.",
            "I get being attracted to a very young looking man because theyre very charming, but when you're only seeking out men that look barely legal, there's grounds for concerns.\n\nThis news comes as no surprise to me and many others",
            "This post comes close to victim-blaming to me. Why are you framing \"daddy fetishization\" as the main problem when the actual issue is porn actors and studios normalizing simulated CP scenarios? It's like saying that younger people going after daddies are at fault for giving leeway for predators like Austin Wolf cover to get away with shit like this.",
            "Im 38 and for some reason my brain does not really find most guys my age physically attractive. Im stuck on something like a Justin Bieber aesthetic from maybe age 21-27.  I dont want to be this way.  I want to get married and be a good father to kids one day but sadly i doubt thats in the cards",
