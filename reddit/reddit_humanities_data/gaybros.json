        "content": "tl;dr: slept overnight with a hookup. couldn't get hard during the sex before bed, but got hard during morning sex\n\nI'm a bottom and last night I matched with a Tinder guy who basically invited me over to his house immediately to sleep over. We exchanged like maybe 4 sentences and then he went to dinner. He messaged me while he was still there and wanted me to meet him at his home after he finished his drink.\n\nI said fuck it. I got out of the bath, was glad that my body was already ready to get fucked so I didn't have to prepare much, and I rushed over to his place.\n\nI was comfortable with this guy. No bad vibes at all, at any point. Looking back on it, it was a beautiful night.\n\nWe cuddled immediately. I'm pretty sure he wanted to fuck since the moment we matched, but the only thing we had talked about prior was \"are you looking for romance, sex, or friendship\" and his answer was romance. Yet here I was headed to his place to sleep overnight after just connecting that same day and barely having a conversation.\n\nI think I was really attracted to the idea of just cuddling. But yeah, I arrived and my clothes were off within minutes. I think I might have been disappointed. I didn't want to move that quickly...but I still liked it?\n\nOh fuck, that's what it was. It wasn't nerves, it was disappointment. No wonder I didn't feel anxious. I only see it in hindsight now. I think I was mentally blocking my disappointment because I'm used to doing that on dates and hookups. I push through with the whole experience, because I don't want to make a snap judgement that's negative; I want to give people a chance.\n\nI don't know. Maybe it was a mix of disappointment and nerves. Or maybe I was just tired. I really don't know, but I couldn't get it hard for pretty much the whole night. I loved the grinding, I loved the boxers play, he was fit, strong, and bearded. We were naked pretty quickly. I loved the fingering, I loved the rimming, and he was a great top. I did cum but it was one of those zero to sixty nuts where you just stroke your frenulum quickly and cum in 60s. I think he was a bit relieved that I finally got card because as soon as I was hard he grabbed my dick from me and went hard and fast so we both came right away. My load was average, like a few shots. Not peak (it had been 2 days) but not minimal either. Honestly, it was pretty good considering I was hard for what felt like just one minute out of the whole evening.\n\nWe cuddle a bit and he falls asleep as soon as he says \"OK, let's get some sleep\". One of those lucky people that can just close their eyes and fall asleep immediately. My ex was like that, and he had no trouble getting hard either...\n\nWas me not getting hard ED? Or just nerves? I didn't feel nervous. This guy was hot and kind. \n\nI did eventually fall asleep. We were laying on top of the covers. All the cum was dry.\n\nIn the morning, he did one of my favorite things, and something I haven't experienced since sharing a bed with my ex: he slid over to me in the morning to get into big spoon position. At some point over night, we had crawled under the sheets, but I did it wrong and was above the flat sheet while he was below. We had a laugh, but I also had a boner. It was immediate. I don't think I had morning wood... but maybe; I don't remember clearly because I just woke up.\n\nI quickly rolled out then back in, under the correct number of layers, and we cuddled for a bit just naked and sleepy. It felt great. I guess oxytocin was flowing, and perhaps I was more relaxed. Or perhaps it was anticipation. I had a hard on the whole time, and his quickly joined mine. The grinding was great, and the moment he kinda pushed me to roll me over so we could spoon was so hot. He spread my ass to align his hard on between my cheeks. I could feel the spring of his erection just slightly pressure my ass. It's honestly one of the best feelings in the world if you're a bottom. \n\nAnyway, I'll spare you the details, but I was hard the entire time. Precumming too. \n\nSo what was different? \n\nWhy was I hard in the morning but not the night before? I felt calm and aroused both times. Is it possible I wasn't actually calm but didn't realize it? I'm actually wondering if supplements I'm taking (Mg and Gaba) which I find chill me out successfully actually are numbing either my sense of arousal or my sense of calmness.\n\nThinking back to other encounters this year... I do struggle to get hard and stay hard. Maybe it's because I'm jerking off too much on my own? Or that I'm just not as comfortable/relaxed as I was while in an LTR?",
