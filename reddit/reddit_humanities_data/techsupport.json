        "content": "Hello /r/TechSupport visitors,\n\nWanted to clarify something that the mod team has been informally enforcing, and I expect to be added to our rules soon:\n\n##***Post replies written by AI chat bots such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, Google Bard, Ernie, etc. are not allowed here.***\n\nChat bots can be fun and interesting, but they are far away from being able to offer reliable technical help. They lack nuance, give bad advice, can be \"bullied\" into saying outlandish stuff, and do all of these things while sounding confident and authoritative. \n\nAnyone can type their issue into ChatGPT and get an AI response. Real people can use real experience and reasoning to give better support, and that is what people expect when they post on a \"forum\" or \"social media\" or \"whatever garbage spez has turned Reddit into\"",

They\u2019ve wanted to be able to do video calls together, but obviously FaceTime isn\u2019t gonna work.\n\nWhat\u2019s the easiest, lowest tech way I can connect them? Hopefully something like an app with a really easy setup and UI.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

            "What other comms apps do they use? If they already use an app like whatsapp or telegram, mostnof these messaging platforms offer video calls",
            "Over the past five years my entire family and friend group became Apple users. Makes me sad but oh well. Ran into this and even though I could never get anyone to actually follow through, my suggestion was everyone install Google Duo. I haven't looked at it in a while so idk if Google shit canned it or if there's a better one but it or its equivalent would probably be the simplest most user friendly one for people who are tech illiterate.",
            "ever heard of Whatsapp, telegram, Instagram, Facebook and tons of app solely based to videocall{IMO , Skype,Google meet",
            "Messenger is great for that as is Whatsapp, insta, and a few others.  I used to work for Verizon (2.5 yrs ago) and my last few months there we learned Apple was rolling out something that let Androids FaceTime via a link but I think it had to be initiated by Apple and not vice versa.",
            "For a moment i thought you meant that your parent was an android lol",
            "you can create a link from facetime for people who don't have an Apple device. Must be at least on iOS 17 i think"
