        "content": "Okay so. I\u2019m going to be an incoming freshman this fall at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I really, really truly want to be a nurse more specifically an L&D Nurse. UTSA does not offer specific nursing courses like other universities. I can only curate my own classes and hope to get into UT Health (San Antonio). I hate that I have to do that, I want to follow an actual curriculum that will prepare me for Nursing school. \n\nNote: I choose UTSA out of highschool because of the affordability (they gave me an abundance in financial aid)\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into programs and Texas A&M has the best nursing program meaning they only take a handful of students. Same for UT Austin. From what i\u2019ve seen/heard everyone loves it. \n\nThis thought would have never occurred if I hadn\u2019t had so much trouble with UTSA. I can\u2019t even list how much they\u2019ve put me through as AN INCOMING freshman. I know no college is perfect. The only thing really keeping me from actually liking UTSA is the fact that my advisors gave me the impression that they would provide nursing classes. I ranted about this on another sub but i just got attacked for \u201cnot doing proper research\u201d. I mean it\u2019s kinda hard to do proper research if the people who are meant to help you straight up lie. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question. Is it worth transferring? \n\nI can either stay at UTSA/CC to finish some more prerequisites then go to nursing school. Or I could transfer to Texas A&M or UT Austin my sophomore year, get used to life there/take advantage of the nursing classes and then apply to nursing school.\n\n The thing is in order to fulfill a bachelors degree of any kind I would need to transfer to UT Austin or Texas A&M and do some classes a part of the core curriculum. \n\nOverall I just feel like I fucked up and I should\u2019ve just gone to Texas A&M straight out of high school. The advisors were just so convincing for UTSA.",

            "OP, look and see if there are transfer scholarships where you want to go to school. In Arkansas, most of the 4 year universities have scholarships for students that transfer in credits. Sometimes they require an associate\u2019s degree with a certain gpa. Sometimes they ask for 24 credit hours with a certain gpa (that case was a few years ago and may not still happen). It\u2019s definitely worth checking on.\nGood luck to you reaching your nursing goal.",
            "If you\u2019re in Texas, you might be able to take ACC courses for a year or two then transfer to UT.",
            "It is 100% worth transferring. I recommend taking core transfer courses, and look for a program that you do like and want so that you're not wasting time while you wait to transfer over. My advice is to talk to an advisor at the place you want to transfer to and ensure credits you are taking will transfer over there. There are basic core transfer credits in the state of Texas like college algebra, biology for majors, General chemistry one and two and English. Those types of courses should have no trouble transferring and you won't waste money or time. Good luck! Don't let anyone dissuade you from your goals. Just make sure everything you're doing can move you towards the goal and not in the opposite direction.",

In Texas it is is a non- science majors and usually part of a Health Sciences degree.\nEdit... sorry, I misread your message but yes students should always check with the advisor at the institution they want to transfer to to ensure the credits will indeed transfer",
            "Yes, I agree. I just picked A&P as an example because I see it the most often. My point was just that there isn't a universal standard of courses that will be accepted at a nursing school, just because it fulfills a core requirement. Between each school/university's system course codes and another university's/nursing program's guidelines from the Registrar\u2019s Office of what they will accept from other universities, you can't assume a class from one school will count at another. \n\nI wasn't disagreeing with your larger message, I just wanted to clarify that one point. It could make a difference once it came down to her nursing application evaluation, and since she wants to be a nurse really badly, I just wanted to be helpful.",
