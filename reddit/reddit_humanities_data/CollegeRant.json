        "content": "Okay so. I\u2019m going to be an incoming freshman this fall at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I really, really truly want to be a nurse more specifically an L&D Nurse. UTSA does not offer specific nursing courses like other universities. I can only curate my own classes and hope to get into UT Health (San Antonio). I hate that I have to do that, I want to follow an actual curriculum that will prepare me for Nursing school. \n\nNote: I choose UTSA out of highschool because of the affordability (they gave me an abundance in financial aid)\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into programs and Texas A&M has the best nursing program meaning they only take a handful of students. Same for UT Austin. From what i\u2019ve seen/heard everyone loves it. \n\nThis thought would have never occurred if I hadn\u2019t had so much trouble with UTSA. I can\u2019t even list how much they\u2019ve put me through as AN INCOMING freshman. I know no college is perfect. The only thing really keeping me from actually liking UTSA is the fact that my advisors gave me the impression that they would provide nursing classes. I ranted about this on another sub but i just got attacked for \u201cnot doing proper research\u201d. I mean it\u2019s kinda hard to do proper research if the people who are meant to help you straight up lie. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question. Is it worth transferring? \n\nI can either stay at UTSA/CC to finish some more prerequisites then go to nursing school. Or I could transfer to Texas A&M or UT Austin my sophomore year, get used to life there/take advantage of the nursing classes and then apply to nursing school.\n\n The thing is in order to fulfill a bachelors degree of any kind I would need to transfer to UT Austin or Texas A&M and do some classes a part of the core curriculum. \n\nOverall I just feel like I fucked up and I should\u2019ve just gone to Texas A&M straight out of high school. The advisors were just so convincing for UTSA.",

            "OP, look and see if there are transfer scholarships where you want to go to school. In Arkansas, most of the 4 year universities have scholarships for students that transfer in credits. Sometimes they require an associate\u2019s degree with a certain gpa. Sometimes they ask for 24 credit hours with a certain gpa (that case was a few years ago and may not still happen). It\u2019s definitely worth checking on.\nGood luck to you reaching your nursing goal.",

            "\"I can only curate my own classes and hope to get into UT Health.\"\u00a0 This isn't entirely uncommon though. For specialized fields, they may not have a specific major for that profession you hoping to go into. If a university doesn't have Nursing/Pre-Nursing as a major, then all one would need to do is pick any major (or choose something like \"Non-Degree Seeking Student\"), and take those pre-reqs and Texas core courses. Then you apply to the nursing school you want.\u00a0\n\n\nI just looked it up and A&Ms website states that all you need to be eligible is to have completed the pre-reqs \"from Texas A&M or another institution.\" You can complete your core and pre-req courses **anywhere**; it doesn't have to be a 4-year university, it can also be through a community college. So take the courses you need at UTSA, then apply to TAMU. Also, there are many paths to getting a BSN. You could do a Traditional program and graduate with your BSN in 2 years. You could do an LVN or RN track, then apply to an RN-to-BSN nursing program and graduate in 2 years. Some Texas community colleges now offer nursing BSN programs, which is much more cost effective compared to paying a 4-year university's tuition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf staying in San Antonio is a priority for you, then going to UTSA won't prevent you from being a nurse. Reach out to the nursing program you're interested in applying to and talk to **their** advisors. They will give you a detailed list of which Texas Core and Pre-req courses they require. Then THAT'S the guide you use when picking your courses each semester. You don't curate it on your own and hope for the best, because what you think might transfer over, might not be on the list of approved courses that school will take. And each nursing school has different required pre-reqs, so UTSA isn't going to know what every nursing school in Texas requires for admission and would not be able to advise you. You will have to take initiative to find out what you need.\u00a0\n\n\nEdited to add: You didn't fuck up, so don't let this stress you out. If you really feel as though you absolutely must do all your education theough one school, and that school can only be A&M, then withdraw from UTSA and apply to A&M. In the grand scheme of your life, one semester isn't that long.\u00a0",
            "It is 100% worth transferring. I recommend taking core transfer courses, and look for a program that you do like and want so that you're not wasting time while you wait to transfer over. My advice is to talk to an advisor at the place you want to transfer to and ensure credits you are taking will transfer over there. There are basic core transfer credits in the state of Texas like college algebra, biology for majors, General chemistry one and two and English. Those types of courses should have no trouble transferring and you won't waste money or time. Good luck! Don't let anyone dissuade you from your goals. Just make sure everything you're doing can move you towards the goal and not in the opposite direction.",
            "First, the most important thing is the thing you\u2019re now doing: taking ownership of your schedule and program map. \n\nSecond, you haven\u2019t taken your first Chem class, your first bio, your first stats class, all pre-reqs for any nursing program. After taking some of those, you may decide you don\u2019t want to stick with that major or career\u2026 you may decide you will. Regardless, you can take those courses anywhere\u2026 taking them where they\u2019re cheaper and the classes are smaller is a good idea. \n\nThird, find out what nursing programs you want to apply for after your first two years, get their requirements, and start chipping away at them. Nursing programs are competitive and you have to applicant regardless of where you start. They usually depend on two things: GPA and shadowing hours. You need to knock both outta the park. \n\nFourth, if you\u2019re prepared academically, make sure you\u2019re taking gen Chem your first semester. Many folks start out pre-health programs with bio, but you need a year of gen Chem, a year of o Chem, a year of bio, a year of A&P, micro bio and possibly cell bio in order to apply to many nursing programs. The Chem will unlock a lot of the upper level courses and keep you on track. Remember that you will most likely have to take multiple lab courses at the same time. \n\nGood luck!",
            "I'm actually the head Moderator at r/UTSA.  \n\nthere is an actual path via utsa to get a nursing degree.  it's actually a partnership with ut health.  you'll spend half your years at utsa and half at UT health.  \n\nthis partnership is relatively new but already receiving some accolades.  \n\nfor a lot of your core classes, I do recommend taking a number via the alamo colleges CCs, as they are guaranteed transfer credits, and MUCH cheaper than taking directly at utsa directly.",
            "Not all universities count the same classes as core. Some count A&P 1 as a Natural Science, while others do not and will require you to have another course fill that credit.\u00a0",
            "Anatomy and physiology is not typically a core course. In Texas it is is a non- science majors and usually part of a Health Sciences degree.\nEdit... sorry, I misread your message but yes students should always check with the advisor at the institution they want to transfer to to ensure the credits will indeed transfer"
