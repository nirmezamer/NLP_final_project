When modders found it in the pc version the esrb board re-evaluated the game and increased its rating. Adding on top of that bad faith news reporting as if the content was accessible by anyone including children(which honestly shouldn't have been playing it in the first place based on the esrb rating) leading to many outraged parents who didn't properly understand the situation.  \n\nWhile BG3 was well just out there with its content... Including bears. Anyone checking the game would reasonably know the content was there.",

The Xbox and Playstation 2 were hitting their limits, and the next generation was just around the corner. (Yes, technically the X360 was out in some places, but it hadn't exactly burst onto the scene yet.)\n\nI thought FEAR and Fahrenheit were cool, but it was a (wait for it) Far Cry from the previous year with Halo 2, Half-Life 2, DOOM 3, Unreal Tournament 2004, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Rome: Total War, Burnout 3, World of Warcraft, Chronicles of Riddick, MGS3, Fable, KOTOR2, Gran Turismo 4, Battle for Middle Earth, and at least a dozen more awesome games.",
