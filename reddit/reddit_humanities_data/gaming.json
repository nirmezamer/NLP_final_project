            "Since this Is on r/gaming, I've got a small JRPG on Steam, it's called Fading Echoes, it takes around 10-15 hours to beat, the strength it's in the replaybility, because some side quests influence the main story, and there also few key decisions in the story itself, for example very early on, a city might get destroy, and you'll lose all the stuff available there, and the plot becomes the characters taking revenge. It's still an Early Access on Steam, but It will probably be completed by end of July, also, I'm bad at making trailers, lol.",

Gets voted out of the tribe after only two gaming sessions. \n\nMy wife, brother, sister, and myself have been playing a co-op on Stardew valley the last few months. We chill, BS about day/week, and overall are just enjoying the new 1.6 update. \n\nThis week, we had the husband of my cousin beg us to join the game. It's kind of awkward as we are in year 2 of the playthrough and most of the farmland has been taken up. But we made room so the guy can play with us. It started out well, but then he started griping about not having resources so we pitched in with quality sprinklers, mid level gear, and seed money. My sister sent him 10k in game and he didn't say too much. \n\nLast night, the dude straight up starts sending people 50k. We started asking \"Bro, are you using mods, or cheating?\". He starts answering in a a smartass tone and acting like he's doing us all a favor. We drill into him somemore on why he's doing this in Stardew of all games and we get \"I'm behind, gotta grind for those tools\". He then proceeds to ghost us on sleeping into the next day. We ended up losing a whole day of progress and an ostrich egg. \n\nOur group chatted over the few hours day and decided he's out. If you want to do that on your own playthrough, cool. But to yolo cheat with money and try to ruin our chill time without even asking, and then outright ghosting people is some bullshit. \n\nAnyone else ever see something like this?",

            "Yes, divorce him. Red flag. I don't care if you need to divorce someone else first, ruin his marriage and then marry him, you need to divorce him so you can get away. Good luck with counselling. \n\nLet me know if you stay safe in an update.",
            "I don't get why he begged to get in and then did this. Unless he's one of those guys who thought he could buy friendship with in game money which is so weird to me.",
            "Lol imagine feeling the need to cheat in a game like Stardew Valley of all things.\n\nThat just tells me this guy is super untrustworthy in general and if he's willing to cheat in SDV he definitely cheats in the bigger games instead of just getting good."
