        "content": "I just started a new world in Minecraft 1.14 to get the god armor. As almost every normal person I found a village and trapped the villagers in a box underground (that was a joke please don't ban me). I get a fletcher for emeralds, buy out all of his stock and when he restocks (keep in mind that I have only bought out all his stock one time) he trades we rather than 1 emerald for 32 sticks, 1 emerald for 54 sticks. Then I trade with him again and buy all his stock again and he trades me 1 emerald for 64 sticks. Anyone know how to fix this?",

            "Those are the 1.14 mechanics, stopping exactly that, just spamming sticks for emeralds. You can trade other stuff to reset both the trades and the prices, they should drop down again. \n\nOtherwise, zombify and cure, should normalise and give you a significant discount as well.",
            "Yeah I know I can do that, but the weird thing is that unlike in resent updates in 1.14 villagers are incredibly brutal with their prices. Like if I buy a fletcher villager's stock twice in 1.21, they'll lower their price to 29 sticks for 1 emerald. but if I do that in 1.14 they'll charge 64 sticks for 1 emerald.",
            "Basic Iron farm with some villagers that buy iron is a good way to get easy early emeralds.\n\n\nBut you can zombify and cure the villagers up to 5x to lower their prices in that version on  hard difficulty. When you buy out villagers it can raise their prices for a while, it is temporary and decays with time.",

This simple version of the farm has a full building tutorial. It is compact, acceptably cheap and extremely easy to build. \n\n- Second, the advanced version of the above. This advanced version is a lot more complex to build. It has about the same rates for cooked beef as the simple one, but adds to those about 8,650 bone meal items per hour, thanks to a shearing trick which allows to produce an insane 95,000 red mushrooms per hour (yes, the figure is correct: ninety-five thousands red mushrooms).\n\n[https://youtu.be/LyIyGGYWBuU](https://youtu.be/LyIyGGYWBuU)",
