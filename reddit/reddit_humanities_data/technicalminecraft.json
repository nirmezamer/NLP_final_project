            "It\u2019s not a great idea for carpet duping on a super smelter in my opinion. Why not use a kelp farm?\n\nThe reason is because the minecarts only distribute one item over the hoppers at a time and it takes 3 carpet to burn a block. So if you can\u2019t deliver the fuel at least 3 times faster than the block your smelting your dead in the water\u2026\n\nA lot of farm designs from these YouTube tutorials work maybe for a few mins and don\u2019t survive actual extended use\u2026",
            "You're 100% correct. [There was a post just yesterday about exactly that](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1dq7a6a/is_farm_theft_the_standard_for_youtube/)\n\nBesides, TheySix's description in this video says this works in Bedrock and last I checked carpet dupers definitely don't. I'll credit that he at least mentioned it wont work on PaperMC in the vid\n\nTheySix and Shulkercraft both grew their channels from stolen designs and neither really develop redstone so they can (and have) frequently posted mistakes or fail to explain *why* you're building something so you'll have a tougher time troubleshooting issues.\n\n/u/ufartedlol -- build any of the popular bamboo farms. If you're on 1.21 then you can even drop in an auto-crafter to change the bamboo to to wood > planks > slabs if you wanted to get extra w/ it.\n\n[potato_noir's bamboo farm smelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dEeGHEIOY) should still work beautifully in 1.21",

            "I\u2019m not against them I just made a video playing with one today actually it\u2019s just that they make such garbage fuel for larger designs, and they often can\u2019t keep up with continuous use if they are delivered via minecart especially\u2026",
            "Gotcha. That makes sense. I have mine delivered via water streams and also set to auto run based on the last hopper in the line being full or not and it's been working great. Haven't necessarily had it running continuously though. Just running back with an inventory full of cobblestone while I work on some projects.",
