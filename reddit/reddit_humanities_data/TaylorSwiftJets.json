        "content": "Hi All: \n\nI\u2019m making a q and a thread to allow users to ask questions and get answers about tracking planes. For those knowledgeable about tracking planes, please feel free to participate. If you work in aviation, we welcome your input. Not guaranteeing questions will be answered. Stay on topic to asking and answering questions about tracking planes in general or specific to Taylor\u2019s jets. \n\nHow I track planes: I usually either look at flightaware or ads-b. I know other people use radar box and flight radar 24.  \n\nAny planes I\u2019m looking at I look up their registration on FAA to determine ownership. Planespotters will sometimes have more \ninformation if a plane is held in a trust \n\nr/flightradar24 is how I started tracking planes. r/adsb is also another general tracking subreddit\n\nHave fun and be civil \n",

            "Hey all, I'm trying to track Taylor's XAA8234; however I'm new to this and can't seem to figure out how to have the physical data pop up on my screen, much less the image of the plane \"flying\" across the screen. Any tips for a beginner to the website?",
            "Maybe I\u2019m really dumb but how do you search a certain tail number on \u201cthe air traffic.com\u201d?",
            "I was on radar box and I clicked on cockpit view, is the box that shows the view from the cockpit window the actual view from the plane that you are watching?",
            "> look up their registration on FAA to determine ownership\n\nWouldn't that usually end up being some random shell company? There seems to be a new law allowing owners to hide the information in certain cases, but I'm surprised that the Registration -> \"owner\" mapping was relevant for major celebrities who presumably have expert legal teams figure out the best ownership structure and I'd expect the hiding happen through opaque shell companies.",
            "It\u2019s not going to show up if it\u2019s not flying",
            "Flight radar 24. Remember it is based on utc time which is 8 hours ahead?  Flight 24 let's you adjust the time zone to your local so it isn't so confusing.",
            "Historical data of a specific plane or historical data of an airport?\u00a0\n\nEdit: not sure about the airport as I generally don\u2019t look for departed and scheduled flights from an airport except when I\u2019m flying, but ads-b holds data for specific planes. Other services have them for 7 days and then you need to pay to get full flight history of a specific plane\u00a0",
            "We will see what happens, but there\u2019s lots of planes in bank of utah trusts where plane spotters figure out who they are because airport employees watch and note tail numbers and who gets off et c\u00a0",
            "You can make a bot that does it which is essentially what Jack did/how Taylor\u2019s jet gets tracked (ie the moderators don\u2019t constantly track her jets). Sometimes the bot misses her plane or messes something up so it\u2019s not 100%\u00a0\n\nIt depends on how much money and time you have to set up a bot, but you could monitor whatever via a bot that watches the trackers 24/7 for you",
            "You probably have the wrong call sign (hers changes so you\u2019d have to look at the old call sign)"

As a reminder, we are a neutral subreddit in that we do not care to have anyone engage back in forth in this commentary. I will ban you permanently if you cannot contribute civilly with each other or participate in flight tracking in good faith. Report rule breaking comments. \n\nSecondly, this is a flight tracking subreddit. Main comments need to reference possible flights or current information related to possible flights and I will be there enforcing that in the speculation thread, since the last thread devolved. \n\nLastly, y\u2019all need to cool it with the the parasocial behavior (either anti-Travis or pro-Travis). This is not the place for that. If the presence or absence of Travis with Taylor causes you a significant emotional reaction, seek therapy and don\u2019t inflict it on the rest of us who are here to track flights.\n\nOn a side note, I am aware there\u2019s trolling going on regarding flights and I regularly ban people for that. \n\n\n\n",

            "Presuming he did go to the states, would T7-VBS be of any significance? It landed 1am ish in teterboro which would make sense for customs and then went on to VNY. It originated in nice though so not sure if maybe there was a reason to be back there?\u00a0",
