        "content": "Recently, we noticed an increased amount of nonsensical explanatory comments with no relation in any way, shape or form to the theme of this subreddit.\n\nThe \"_leopards ate my face_\" theme is embodied by this quote in the sidebar.\n\n> \"_I never thought leopards would eat **my** face_\", sobs woman who voted for the _Leopards Eating People's Faces Party_. Revel in the schadenfreude anytime someone has a sad because they're suffering consequences from something they voted for, supported or wanted to impose on other people.\n\nThis statement made out of 3 parts.\n\n1. **Someone** voted for, supported or wanted to impose **something** on **other people**.\n2. **Something** has the consequences of **consequences**.\n3. As a consequence of **something**, **consequences** happened to **someone**.\n\nIn your explanatory comment, answer these 3 elements and include the minimum amount of information necessary so your post can be understood by everyone, even if they don't live in the US or speak English as their native language. If you fail to identify them, it will be difficult for a moderator to understand if this post fits and it will probably be removed. If you complain about it, we'll just send you back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/lt8zlq).\n\nThe explanatory comment is not the place to write a pretty poem nor is it the place to promote books. Copying this post, copying large parts of the article and nonsensical comments will get your post removed under rule #3. Keep it stupid simple.\n\nTo help you get started, here's an example.\n\n1. Helen, Roberto Beristain's wife, voted for Donald Trump, who vowed to impose deportation to illegal immigrants such as her husband.\n2. Voting for Trump, who vowed to deport illegal immigrants such as Roberto Beristain, has the consequence of having illegal immigrants deported and families separated.\n3. As a consequence of voting for Trump, Roberto Beristain got deported and Helen's family was separated.\n\nYou should absolutely make sure that it is easy to match your explanatory comment with the provided format or your post will be mercilessly removed. If, however, you can't match your explanatory comment with the format, then you should just delete your post and save us the effort.",

Name the person \n2. Name something they supported or voted for\n3. How did their vote/support end up hurting them.\n\nLike literally make them connect the dots in A very common sense way.\n\nAs it right now,\nThe auto comment pops up and just says: \u201cexplain how this fits the sub\u201d and then people give a shitty explanation that shows irony or karma, but isn\u2019t actually about leopards eating faces."
