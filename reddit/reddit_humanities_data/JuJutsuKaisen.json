New chapters are released every Sunday at around 10 PM MST (UTC-7). [**Viz Media**](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/jujutsu-kaisen?locale=en) \\- Only the first three and most recent 3 chapters are available for free, but for $2 a month, you can read the entire series (and every series on their site), including Volume 0, Jujutsu Kaisen's Prequel. New chapters are also released on the same day and time as on the Shueisha site.  \n>  \n>Unofficially, Google \"read Jujutsu Kaisen free\" and make sure you have an adblocker installed.\n\n# What is the movie about?\n\n>It covers Volume 0, a one-shot prequel that Gege wrote before writing the main series of Jujtusu Kaisen. Yuta Okkotsu is the main character and it the story takes place 1 year prior to the main series.\n\n# Should I read Volume 0? And when?\n\n>You can read it whenever you like, but Chapter 63 is a good point to read it. It explains some of the events and motivations that happen in the JJK storyline.\n\n# Where can I watch the anime and movie?\n\n>Legally on Crunchyroll. We unfortunately have to keep links to aggregate sites off of the sub or risk it being flagged for takedown. Otherwise, try Googling \"where to watch anime free reddit\".\n\n# Which chapters correspond to which episode?\n\n>u/HououinKyoma23 created an amazing guide that covers every episode:chapter in the series!
