            "I remember when we visited Vietnam, they had No Durian signs all over. Businesses like Hotels and Tourist places like Museums knew people who were not used to the smell would gag. \n\nMy mother loved the fruit. I tasted it, and it tasted okay, but I could not detach the taste from the smell.",
            "Whats the purpose of that quick, small horizontal cut before throwing the exterior in the bin?",
            "Ive always wanted to try one, just because people always say how horrible they smell. This makes me want to try one even more",
            "The best is freezing Durian and eating it like ice cream. It smells less and offsets its dense heat. This fruit is said to be heated in Thai, meaning that youre supposed to eat only a few and avoid drinking alcohol. Its very calorific as well. My mother had a craving for durian whilst she was pregnant with me. I turned out to be a giant baby and the tallest in my entire family. I turned out to be six foot tall Korean chick. My dad called me radioactive. ",
            "Why does he cut across the inside of the husk once the fruit is gone? He does it so fast it's hard to see, but after he removes the fruit he slices the inside white portion sometimes. \n\nI thought it was quickly checking to see if there was more, but he's not even looking at it, so that can't be it. Anyone know?",
            "Looks like uni, smells like death",
            "I was just in Vietnam and saw signs all over that prohibited people from bringing durian inside hotels bc of the smell. So it made me hesitant to eat it. What does it taste like? Im planning to be back in SEA next year so maybe Ill try it then!",
            "No, the inside skin of the durian is useful. After eating durian, you can wash your hands with the inside of the skin. Just put some water on it and use it to wash/rinse your hands; the durian smell will disappear. You can also gargle with it to reduce the durian smell in your mouth.",
            "Lived in SE Asia a handful of years. The smell killed me at first then after I ate it the smell wasnt nearly as offensive and sometimes even good. Hard to explain but eating it was the best thing I did",
            "Honestly, how sharp is that thing? Mild annoyance, ruin your day or hospital trip?"

            "I usually enjoy these videos cuz the process is interesting and there's always a zen-like quality but this one was wild. She's like a whirlwind of bamboo destruction. Also a lot of little weird things. She falls off the path and we hear a perfectly cut scream. The dog and cat are having a war. There's a closeup shot of blood on her leg. The animals are constantly in her way. The sound effects are crazy loud. Finally, after building most of the swing with nothing but bamboo and a dream, she apparently throws tradition to the wayside and finishes the job with modern equipment.",
