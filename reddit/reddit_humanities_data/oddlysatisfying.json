These windows suck, and he did amazing at repairing and replacing everything. I personally wouldn't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.",
            "I mean it\u2019s great craftsmanship but wasn\u2019t rope used because it was quiet compared to the chain running against the wood? And the squeaking? Maybe it\u2019s to the charm of the place, idk",

        "content": "I bought a ca. 1906 late Victorian that had been \u2018flipped\u2019 by a Bill & Joanna Gaines wannabe. They made some questionable decisions in their renovation, one of which being the weird green-grey carpet in the upstairs bedrooms. I decided to pull up the carpet and lay down wood in the room I planned to use as my office, and when I pulled the carpet I found that 1) there was glorious original hardwood underneath (although weirdly its part red oak and part heart pine) and 2) the carpet install was so half-ass it only took me 2 hours to strip and dispose of the carpet - including driving it to the dump -  and another 2 hours with a belt sander to get it looking nice. I left a good bit of the \u2018distressed\u2019 character it had, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to get it perfect then ding it up myself. This was my first time refinishing hardwood. Huge thank you to the lazy crew that saved me a ton of work saving these floors, can\u2019t wait to do the rest of the bedrooms!",

            "I'm European, I love wooden floors, or the fake wood, whatever, anything but a carpet, but I'll be honest, that hardwood isn't very \"glorious\" it looks pretty bad even renovated and definitely turns the apartment into a shed in my eyes... The wood is not very uniform, probably rather cheap, and the dark stains in certain spots look like someone died there lmao",

I mean, wood should expand and contract when heatet, will the paint stick or flake?~~\n\n~~I'm just asking because I never seen painted saunas before and there is probably reason for it. More reasons than the nice smell of wood.~~\n\nIt does look nice ~~but I want to know if it's practical.~~\n\nEdit: Got my answer, thanks OP.",
            "Re-finnished... ;)",
            "It\u2019s soothing alright. Until your naked skin meets a 70 Celsius lacquered surface and fuses with it while you\u2019re sitting on it. Joke aside, I\u2019m sure there is a good reason why saunas have been natural wood for hundreds of years, no?",
            "Nice work. You\u2019ll need it come winter. Greetings from Oregon!",
            "Looks nice, but the wood will be destroyed by the heating and moisture since it can\u2019t breathe freely, and the stain is going to release toxic fumes when you heat it, so it\u2019s not really safe to use as a sauna anymore, and even as a closet it would have been better with raw cedar to prevent pests. So\u2026",
            "It's black because the previous guy had half-asded it in black. I just wanted it to look even. Something little more see through would've been nicer, but I think I still would've gone for grey or... less black. \n\nThe \"paint\" is actually wax, or oil. I think it's paraffin-based. I've also been told, that paint won't stick in a sauna, propably because of the heat expansion, which you mentioned. This stuff is specifically made for saunas, and it's been popular here in Finland for ages. So I guess it'll stay looking nice. This is the first one I've ever done, or had for myself.\n\nAnd for practicality, this should make the wood last longer. Especially the seats, that tend to rot, if not treated. I'm under the impression, that the seats should be treated in anycase. I guess most times people just use the clear stuff. These had been treated, but only on the top surface.",
            "Exactly\ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, wait! There's more!\n\nWe actually have a word that's kinda similar, \"paluumuuttaja\", return-mover in english. Meaning the people whose parents left Finland during WW2, and  were born abroad, and then moved back to Finland.\n\nThey automatically get citizenship, if they just apply for it.\n\nSo... re-Finnished!\n\n(I know I really killed the joke)",
            "This is such a danish joke...",
            "Thanks for picturing my naked skin, I'm sure everybody liked that\ud83d\ude01\n\nBut like I already explained for couple of others, this stuff is safe to use, and made specifically for saunas. It's not lacquer, it's waxed based oil (or something, possibly paraffin).\n\nAlso, some people like their electric saunas up to 100\u00b0c. And saunas equipped with wood burning stoves can reach 130\u00b0c, which was the case in the sauna world championships.",
            "Thanks! \n\nI use it year around, but of course it's even nicer in the wintertime\ud83d\ude0a"
