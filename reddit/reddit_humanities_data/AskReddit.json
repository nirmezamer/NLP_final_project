Physical damage was I had to wait 12 weeks for spicy time but it was VERY painful for 6ish months. As nerves healed I got painful stabbing pains in both areas (tbh mostly the urethra which took longest to heal fully). I was \u201cback to normal\u201d at a year. I have regained all sensation and am fully operational. Baby was a week late and nearly 10lbs. Don\u2019t reproduce with a family of tall people. Oh and I had another baby a couple years after this incident. He ended up giving me preeclampsia and my husband got a vasectomy. Never. Again.",

            "Coming into work and seeing the same people still playing that were there when I left the night before.",
            "I worked at a casino over a decade ago, but here's mine: Somebody won a small jackpot, something like $2000. When checking her ID for tax paperwork it was discovered that she had put herself on the state's problem gambler self-exclusion list, which meant the casino was obligated to remove her from the building without paying (she wouldn't have been allowed in the building if she had been recognized). While double checking the manager downloaded an updated list (we auto-checked against a local copy that was sometimes a few days out of date) and it showed that she had removed herself from the list with sufficient notice, so the jackpot was paid out.\n\nShe proceeded to put every penny of the jackpot back into the slot machine... And also made a couple visits to the ATM... And at the end of her stay she asked the cashiers if she could be put back on the self-exclusion list.",
            "Ex-casino worker here. I saw way too many people spend ridiculous amounts of money on gambling. I've seen little kids asleep in chairs outside the casino floor cause their parents were busy gambling. A gentleman had a heart attack at a poker table and other gamblers were pissed cause we had to stop the games so EMS could come. \n\nSaddest one though was a lady who wanted to cash a check made out to the electric company. She wanted to know if she could scratch out the company name and write in the casino name. I told her we could not do that.",

            "My first December working in the casino I'm still at I was on a blackjack table and a guy sits down and drops $1565 on the table and tells the dealer \"dealer, my family's about to have a great Christmas or no Christmas\"\n\n20 minutes later it's gone and he asks the dealer if she's happy with herself and how well the casino has to be paying her. \n\nNever saw the guy again(our casino is 95% repeat customers) so I wouldn't be surprised if that actually was his Christmas money.",

I moved the car and informed my super. He called the cops as it was the smell of a decaying body.\n\nCops came and we opened the truck.... full of groceries.... from 4 months ago.... in the missouri summer heat.  It was chicken. They came to claim their car and were told to not park here in valet again\n\nThey said the person who normally carries their groceries up to their second floor apartment left and they don't have anyone to help them anymore. So now they go to casinos and eat out every night....\n\nThey didn't have money to do this, no idea where it came from. I will never gamble or go to a casino after working valet those years. Many many more stories",
            "We had a roulette and black jack table room that joined with a night club I worked in. There was this guy who spent more money than I made in two months in just a few hours.\n\n He wasn't drunk. I tried to get him to stop playing (he was the only player at the table) but he just said he is lonely and playing blackjack was the only thing that made him feel ok. He was far away from home (I think he was Russian) and just really really sad. It was tough to watch. His face looked just as vacant when he left as when he started playing. So sad",
            "Casino worker here - winning big can ruin your life.  It\u2019s like a drug and I have seen so many people try to chase that high again.   They start at higher denomination machines and slowly over time you see them move to $1, .50, .25 and eventually down to the lowest level.",

His was losing and mine started winning big I got shoved off that seat so fast\u2026. \n\nI don\u2019t miss that place it\u2019s full of greed and misery"

Outside influences are your downfall. The internet is your downfall. Build relationships with people who live in the moment. Not people who deal in social media maybes.

So I stopped by his place and we ate and chatted and then I pulled out the strudel for dessert. \n\nThis man insisted on making homemade whipped cream to top them off. I was like \"no, no, it's fine, it'll take too long to make, they're good plain.\" Didn't phase him. He had it made in minutes and he was right - that strudel was even better with whipped cream. This is probably also when he learned that making me good food is a quick way to win my heart. Days later it was chocolate chip cookies, then butter chicken, then a cheesecake. \n\nWe moved in together after like 3 months. That was just over 3 years ago. We cook together as often as possible.
