As a man myself, on the rare occasion, I do get a compliment it makes my frigging day and my heart melt. If the man is important to you, TELL HIM. If he's your best friend, TELL HIM.

I just thought he was sleeping the day away since he'd been working so hard for days before. He was not sleeping. I just knew something was off as soon as I stepped into the room.

Cross to the other side of the street if you don't like what you see ahead. Be wary of distraction: one person starts shouting at something, while their partner grabs your bag. There are two speeds on the street: move fast, or get out of the way.  Wallets don't go in your back right pocket. Three-card monte is not a game.\n\nOptional: Don't walk down the street with your cans in.
