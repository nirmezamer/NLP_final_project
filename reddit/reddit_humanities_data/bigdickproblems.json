        "content": "I'm m23, my boyfriend (m22) is very hung.   I'm scared by this.  I have told him that I am inexperienced, especially with that size.  He is very loving and caring with me, we have a beautiful romantic connection.  We have talked and want to have our first time together soon, I have flirted a bit of a big game.\n\nThe thing is, I see him as my life partner.  I know that's a big thing to say before the first time, but we were friends for a year and been dating for almost two months now.  (We have waited a long time to get physical because I am a CSA survivor.  He is the sweetest, caring guy about this).   I love him so much and I want to please him well.  I am worried that I won't be able to take him well orally or for penetration.\n\nIf I may ask to the hung guys here, straight or not, how much patience do you have with a partner about taking your size?  And is it easier overtime to take a bigger dick?\n\nThanks for the help, this is on my mind a lot lately.",

            "You should always have patience. Takes things slow. And it definitely gets easier over time",
            "Most of the relationships I've been in, I've had to take it slow i have only met maybe two partners in my life that could take the whole thing right away, slow and steady wins the race, It Definitely gets easier over time go slow and use lubrication when doing the deed that'll help it might take a couple tries or more communication is key.",
            "Woman here. Whose current bf is hung af. Take time, go slow, use loads of lube and loads of foreplay. Foreplay and aftercare are important af.\n\nMy bf been so loving and caring- and been going slow and steady. Patience is key!",
            "You take as much patience as your partner on the receiving end needs.  This is why lube and foreplay are both important factors, but communication is 100% key.",
            "Get the vas out n chalk the cue n pray",
            "Every woman the freaked out when i stick it in, always made me move slow, then asked me to go hard.",
            "There's nothing wrong with sticking to hands and mouth stuff until you get more comfortable with sexual interactions in general with him before you proceed to intercourse. The more comfortable and relaxed you are in the situation, the easier anal will be. As others have said, even when you do try anal, go slow. You don't have to take it all, *ever* in fact. I know you mentioned concern about wanting to please him, but please remember it should be enjoyable for you as well. Be kind to yourself and have grace, and rest in the knowledge that your partner is kind and will do the same to you as well. Good luck. :)",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure this says m/m so some of the advice is ok, but you do have to start stretching your hole out. Communication, lube, and foreplay are all good things, but if you\u2019re going for anal you have to do a lot of actual physical pret work.",
            "I've had this problem a couple times with some of the people I've seen. All I know is at least from my experience I was patient because I wanted to be right for both of us and I wanted to make sure they feel good and comfortable. I really cared about them and I wanted to make sure it was a positive experience for both of us. I know that sounds like a very generic answer but if they're the right person they'll be patient they'll understand it's okay to take your time with these things.",
            "Patience is key and he should already know this if he has any experience. Long slow fore play to get you wet and aroused. Oral on you until you have an orgasm seems to help. Use a lot of lube. Cowgirl position might the best position to start. You can control the depth this way. Do not be discouraged if you do not go the entire length the first time. It may take a few more times before you can take more length. Good luck."

Camera angles and lights and positions to make the dicks look bigger and the girls look smaller. Also helps that a lot of the actresses are like 5ft nothing",
            "Now I'm not a big consumer of porn Nowadays. But I remember some people doing a tell all interview years ago. They said the average penis in porn is somewhere around six and a half inches. I thought that was crazy because when I grew up the myth was the average was 6 in. So my thought was most porn actors are only a half inch above average. I mean now we know six and a half inches is big but most of them aren't monsters. Then you find out later that most of these actresses are like 4 ft 11 and weigh 100 lb with tiny hands. Then as many have stated above camera angles we wonder why most of these guys dicks glisten during scenes because they are drenched in the best lube. Then I've also heard porn actresses say when they do take one or two big dicks they have to take time off because it does fuck them up sometimes.",
