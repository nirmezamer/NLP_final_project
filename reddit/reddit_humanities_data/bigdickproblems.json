Also dosent help that I am a large frame guy with large thighs and a bit of a belly. Almost every woman I've been with has made commitments about my size, which I always attributed to girth. But I am slowly starting to realize I have a very large dick.",

            "I\u2019m thick but still always wanted to be thicker (well aware I have dysmorphia) there\u2019s something about that meaty and heavy look. Thinner dicks just don\u2019t have that effect. No offense to anyone this is simply my opinion/taste",

        "content": "By popular demand here is the truest test that could be created outside of a women putting the dildo or penis inside them. You would create a hollow silicone penis. You would fill it with warm water from a chamber beneath. It's initial state would be something to the effect of 3 in by 3 in. That would put it at the micro penis level. One would think that this will be no woman's ideal but you never know. You would have a woman wrap her hand around the penis. Now researchers are finding that the average length is closer to 5.2 but for this experiment will go ahead with the 5.4 length often stated. The girth is almost universally put at 4.6. That means for every inch in girth the length has to outpace it by .174. Initially the length will have to out pace girh to get to average length and girth. The woman will be instructed to tell the researcher to stop as soon as the length and or girth reaches an acceptable level for her pleasure. It will continue until the length and or girth reaches her ideal. If one or the other hits first it stops and the other continues. Then it would continue on until the length and or girth reaches a point where she says that is too big. This way you can get three different data points. The researcher may even want to do this three times with the same woman. Doing this with a silicone penis filled with warm water expanding will make it feel more real. With the woman holding it right in front of them will also more simulate real situations. The main reason this is better than previous tests is because you will get a more exact measurement as it expands. In past tests they just hand dildos at different inch or half inch increments or they use 3D modeling. That was long as hell but hope it was somewhat entertaining.",

            "> outside of a women putting the dildo or penis inside them.\n\nI'm glad that you mentioned this caveat since an actual ideal test has to involve insertion with a woman relaxed/warmed up. It's also why I'm skeptical of the results from the 3D model experiment. Ultimately, a woman's ideal size is going to be based on what she feels when it's *inside*. The closest thing available now is what women say about dildos.",

Throughout my teen years and even until late 20\u2019s I honestly thought that women said these things to all men and I always took the compliments with a pinch of salt - I never really believed them and thought it was a common thing in the bedroom. \n\nMy erect size is 23cm which to me through my teen years and 20\u2019s I honestly felt it was average size. Due to sizes shown on porn I honestly thought that as mine was in some cases similar, that I was indeed average. I had partners exclaim things like \u201cyou do know you do have a really big dick\u201d\u2026 \u201cwow that\u2019s huge\u201d etc\u2026 I really thought it was to ego massage and to make me feel good as a man. \n\nIt was only in my late 20\u2019s when I thought that this trend is continuing that I looked at scientific results over dick size. I was mind blown that in the UK where I am from that the average size is about 13cm - like to me that seemed very small due to my warped reality. \n\nI struggled with my size in multiple relationships and latterly found out about size queens and their actual preference and appreciation for more endowed men. It\u2019s been a journey of discovery - just wanted to find out if many of you here had the same warped reality that I had and for as long as I did. ",

            "In my teens and early 20 women never said a word. Nothing. I knew I had a big one because I could easily compare myself with the rest of the men at the locker\u2019s room but then women would never mention my size, they didn\u2019t show any sign of surprise or admiration. I don\u2019t know if it was because they lacked experience or they thought that wasn\u2019t a ladylike way of acting so they repressed it. Probably both. But they got me thinking that either size really didn\u2019t matter or I wasn\u2019t so big after all.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 25 or 26 (when I moved to the US) that women started going crazy for it.

She said something like if you are getting comments and compliments without asking then they are probably true.",

I didn't really believe it until a girl I hooked up with later told another female friend of ours that I was really big while they were out drinking. The mutual friend starting acting a little different around me and later admitted she'd heard that I was big. Thats when I realized it might be true and not just hyping me up while in bed. So I found calcsd and turns out I'm like 95%+ percentile for length. Still average girth tho lol",

            "Many of us share similar stories. Porn really messes up the sense of average.   \nAnd I also just assumed girls say that when they're in the moment to make us feel good, the same way I'll tell a partner how hot she is while we're going at it.   \nI did have some weird early experiences with girls who couldn't take it, but I just assumed we were both just really young and inexperienced, and later on I thought I must have been doing something wrong because sex would hurt and she'd tap out. One partner even said \"OMG that's supposed to fit inside me?!\" but she was pretty inexperienced too (this was back in college), and I never thought about it again. \n\nOne day I read the average size and thought... I wonder where I stack up. \n\nBOOM. I had to measure multiple times because I didn't believe it. I still have a hard time believing it."
