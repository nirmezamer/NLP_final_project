            "There were many more factors than what that says. The airport was foggy, overcrowded (there had been a bombing earlier so\u00a0air traffic\u00a0was rerouted to Tenerife, which was used to regional traffic) and didn't have any radar or even runway lights. The ATC on duty wasn't fluent in English yet was having to coordinate complex maneuvers with multiple planes in the language. van Zanten was also risking prison time if he stayed on shift too long, due to Dutch duty-time law.
