This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.\n\nAlso make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).\n\nAre you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H\u00e4kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.\n\nRemember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.\n\nHave a meta question about the subreddit?

And it's not moving at all, perfectly still. This is norhing like what we see on Lap 6-7 on Sunday with the movements it was making. \n\nI've been trying to do more investigating lately and I always believed it was steering column but have been suprised to see lot's of people especially on Reddit refute that theory.",
            "In turn 9 and 10 today there's a gravel trap to deter drivers from going over the track limit, but somehow they still seem give track limit penalties if people do go over? \n\nIsn't that kind of double dipping?",
            "Oscar was right to go for the overtake but he gave the win to Max.",

            "I cant believe some people are annoyed at Oscar for overtaking Norris and not being able to catch Max. Its up to the team to swap them or Lando to overtake again.\n\nIf it was the GP then sure, play the team game and swap them through/dont let Max build that lead if possible but its a fucking sprint lol",
            "Piastri was .900 seconds behind when Norris made the overtake on Max, and he was .400 before the corner where Max retook the lead. All gained back fairly and quite intelligently as opposed to being aggressive. Very curious to see both Landos and Oscars telemetry in that sequence of events. \n\nAmusing that we seem to have such a weird split in F1 fandom on when team orders should and shouldn't be used.",
            "His race pace still needs some work, but hes shown good racecraft today. \n\nI get people are mad because Norris seemed faster, but it was his fault that he lost the position",
            "He just needs to work on his pace. Big things coming his way if he does",
            "I cant believe some people are mad at him",
            "Well deserved after last race",
            "Fantastic pass and defense today by Oscar",
            "It's pretty mental that some people are having a pop at Piastri for daring to be ahead of Norris this race - especially when you look at how often Piastri has obeyed team orders to let Norris through",
            "Hes a great talent and Im glad hes getting the opportunity to showcase that. However today shows just how much more experience both drivers need fighting at the front is McLaren ever wants to be a serious title contender again. Lando has a lot to learn from his previous mistakes.",
            "bruh if Norris cant overtake Piastri, ain't no way he'd overtake Max"
