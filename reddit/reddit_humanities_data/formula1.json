This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.\n\nAlso make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).\n\nAre you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H\u00e4kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.\n\nRemember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.\n\nHave a meta question about the subreddit?
