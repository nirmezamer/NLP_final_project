            "Love the creative liberties they're taking here. I think this is the manga's best arc, and the anime's direction might make it even better",
            "That fucking transition when Akane and Kana change into the characters they'll be acting as gave me chills that was so good.",
            "YO HOW DOES THIS LOOK EVEN BETTER THAN SEASON 1??? That transition into their costumes at the end was so sick!",
            "Holy shit they cooked, that himekawa and kana scene was out of this world",
            "Kana's voice actor is cook- no she ate and left no crumbs.",
            "The best arc getting finally getting adapted. \n\nY\u2019all think this could potentially be as popular and impactful as season 1 was? Most likely right?",

            "This is what happens when both sides in a relationship need fixing but neither is in position to fix the other.\u00a0",
            "Hikaru saying the line about Ai not knowing how to take care of herself over the picture of the bolted door is just sinister",
            "OMG I think I know what the real purpose of the \u201815 year lie\u2019 movie is.\n\nWhile Kamiki wanted to be really loved by somebody, Ai was scared of love. She never had a loving parental figure during her childhood, and that probably affected her capacity of intimacy. She loved Kamiki, but was probably afraid that she would have not been able to love him in the right way or that she would have ended up hurting him. She thought that parting ways with him was the best solution, so he can find the love he deserves somewhere else. However, after she got the twins, she slowly realised that she was able to love somebody, and because of that she opened up to the idea of introducing to the kids their dad (we saw her inviting Kamiki to see the kids). However, Kamiki, who thinks that she just used him like all the other women, decided to kill her.\n\nI think that the \u201815-year lie \u2018 is the lie that Ai told Kamiki when she was 15, which we will probably get to know about in the next chapter. She probably told him that she didn\u2019t love him but that wasn\u2019t true. \nThe movie about her life, that she wanted to do whit Gotanda, was not for the fans, not for her children, it was for Kamiki. It was an act of love towards Kamiki, to show him why she said that lie. The movies\u2019 real purpose was to show Kamiki that she loved him. \n\nShowing Kamiki that Ai actually love him is the best revenge Aqua can have. Cause Kamiki would understand that he killed the only person that actually loved him. Kamiki thinks that the movie exaggerates by showing their moments together like those of a normal couple of their age who love each other. But that\u2019s probably what Ai felt about those moments. She probably reminisced them as moments when she felt happy.\n\nTo end my big essay LOL,  Ai and Aqua are very similar. Both are afraid of loving somebody, afraid that they would end up hurting the other person or that they don\u2019t deserve love ( Aqua\u2019s relationships with Kana and Akane show that).",
            "It's nice to see more representation of male victims of grooming, sexual assault and pedophilia. The way the older women looked at him and treated him is so disgusting I'm not surprised he turned out the way he did",
            "Wait, does this mean the \"15 year lie\" wasn't the 15 years of Ai being murdered, but the 15 years Kamiki was living as a kid when they met with his belief that he wasn't worth love...? Was Ai's final wish to \"save\" Kamiki...?",
            "Okay but telling a grieving kid, no matter their situation with the people involved, to \"take the burden of living the [deceaseds] lives\" on their shoulder is messed up",
            "Now I understand how Aqua is trying to \u2018kill\u2019 Kamiki. \n\nKamiki believes that his relationship with Ai was one-sided, and that AI never loved him. He *has* to believe that. And Aqua\u2019s goal is to make him realize that Ai did in fact love him, and that this will emotionally destroy Kamiki. Because he killed the one person who loved him, the one person he thought he could never find. \n\nOooooh boy, this is getting interesting.\n\nEdit: Another thing I feel people aren\u2019t focusing enough on is his specific wording, being that he was \u2018jealous.\u2019 Who would Kamiki be jealous of? Ai\u2019s success doesn\u2019t make sense, he\u2019s just as successful. Not her fans, because they have no connection to her. \n\nIt was always the twins. When Ai called him, he could tell- even though she was afraid to say it- that she loved the twins. She finally wanted to share a part of herself with someone else. Kamiki was jealous of Ruby and Aqua!\n\nNow we just have to figure out exactly how this transitioned into him killing other top stars.",
            "Ultimately, the problem between Ai and Hikaru was  that both of them didn\u2019t have a good healthy grasp on love. Hikaru was too dependent on Ai loving him to help bear his burden, but Ai couldn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings because she didn\u2019t know how to love anyone else. This was an unhealthy relationship that was doomed to fail.",
            "Now that we have the kanji for \"Hikaru\", we can see that Airi used it to make Taiki's name. Ballsy as fuck. She stuck the actual father's name in the son's name. She was daring anyone to call her out for what she did."
