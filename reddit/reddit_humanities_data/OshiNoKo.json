            "Holy shit!! The anime direction!!!!\nOmg that himekawa and kana scene left me speechless.\nAkane looks good too",
            "The use of color here is immaculate, I'm kinda glad Kana doesn't look like Tsurugi now. The contrast between both characters appearances really works here.",
            "Love the creative liberties they're taking here. I think this is the manga's best arc, and the anime's direction might make it even better",
            "That fucking transition when Akane and Kana change into the characters they'll be acting as gave me chills that was so good.",
            "YO HOW DOES THIS LOOK EVEN BETTER THAN SEASON 1??? That transition into their costumes at the end was so sick!",
            "Holy shit they cooked, that himekawa and kana scene was out of this world",
            "Kana's voice actor is cook- no she ate and left no crumbs.",
            "The best arc getting finally getting adapted. \n\nYall think this could potentially be as popular and impactful as season 1 was? Most likely right?",
            "Hell yeah Ayaneru is a great addiction to the cast, one of my favorite VA's.",
            "At first i was worried about colour choice but after watching the trailer i have more faith"

            "This is what happens when both sides in a relationship need fixing but neither is in position to fix the other.",
            "Hikaru saying the line about Ai not knowing how to take care of herself over the picture of the bolted door is just sinister",
            "It's nice to see more representation of male victims of grooming, sexual assault and pedophilia. The way the older women looked at him and treated him is so disgusting I'm not surprised he turned out the way he did",
            "Wait, does this mean the \"15 year lie\" wasn't the 15 years of Ai being murdered, but the 15 years Kamiki was living as a kid when they met with his belief that he wasn't worth love...? Was Ai's final wish to \"save\" Kamiki...?",
            "Okay but telling a grieving kid, no matter their situation with the people involved, to \"take the burden of living the [deceaseds] lives\" on their shoulder is messed up",
            "Ultimately, the problem between Ai and Hikaru was  that both of them didnt have a good healthy grasp on love. Hikaru was too dependent on Ai loving him to help bear his burden, but Ai couldnt reciprocate his feelings because she didnt know how to love anyone else. This was an unhealthy relationship that was doomed to fail.",
            "Now that we have the kanji for \"Hikaru\", we can see that Airi used it to make Taiki's name. Ballsy as fuck. She stuck the actual father's name in the son's name. She was daring anyone to call her out for what she did.",
            "The contrast between Aqua and Frill's potrayal of Hikaru's rape and the actual scene somehow makes it more disturbing.\n\nIn Aqua's potrayal, Hikaru seemed aware of what was going on and was disgusted. In reality Hikaru seems somewhat confused, not even fully understanding what was being done to him. The innocence on his face just makes it so much worse",
            "\"15 Year Lie\" = Kamiki thinking nobody loves him\n\nAi wanted him to know she really loved him after all.",
            "So when the Idol starts with \"You're my savior, You're my Saving Grace\" was it also meant to be for Ai from Hikaru? Bcz man, what a chapter this was"
