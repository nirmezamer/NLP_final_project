            "**Enter here:** [**https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign**](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign) (Winners' names will also be announced in this link after the drawing and in this thread).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, it seems like after a long period when the cool kids just wanted to make their cables prettier (because they most often weren't), now the big thing is not seeing the cables at all! Meet BTF, the ASUS hidden connector design that makes it so CPU, GPU + almost all motherboard cables are pretty much invisible, which, if that's your thing, can make for some extremely clean builds. The connectors and most cables can be placed on the underside of the motherboard, making way for a look that feels ultimately more simple than seeing a bunch of cables everywhere.\n\nBesides BTF there is ADVANCED BTF, that goes even further, and eliminates the need for GPUs to have an external (and often not great looking) power cable connected directly to the GPU, but instead powers them through a PCIe high-power connector on BTF graphics cards that is compatible with a high-power slot available on BTF motherboards.\n\nNow, we've teamed up with ROG to give to some very lucky members of the community a chance to get their hands on some of the most prized BTF components out there, including, the absolute dream that is the RTX 4090 Strix BTF!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PRIZES**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 BTF Edition Graphics Card**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER BTF White Edition Graphics Card**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **ROG Hyperion GR701 BTF Edition Chassis**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **TUF Gaming GT302 ARGB Chassis**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **Corsair 6500X Chassis (Black)**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **Cooler Master MasterBox 600 Chassis (White)**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming B760M-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **InWin D5 Chassis (Black)\u200b**\n\n3 winner(s) will receive a **ROG Falchion RX Low Profile\u200b Keyboard**\n\n3 winner(s) will receive a **ROG Gladius III Wireless AimPoint\u200b Mouse**\n\n5 winner(s) will receive the **ROG Cetra True Wireless SpeedNova\u200b Headphones**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's 25 prizes for 18 lucky winners! And yes, this is a WORLDWIDE event!\n\n**Enter here:** [**https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign**](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can enter until June 30, 2024 at 11:59PM PDT and the winner will be picked, contacted and then announced on socials, including this very thread. More info and full terms are on the [main entry page](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign).\n\nMay your framerates be high, and your temperatures low this month of June, preferably with a nice ASUS BTF hardware bundle or other ROG goodies.

This hybrid technology leverages the self-emissive properties of OLED panels, which are known for their ability to display perfect black levels and wide viewing angles. By incorporating quantum dots, QD OLED displays achieve a notable increase in brightness and a wider color spectrum compared to traditional OLEDs. These quantum dots are stimulated by blue light to emit precise colors, significantly enriching the visual experience with more saturated and vivid hues. As a result, QD OLED displays not only maintain the incredible contrast and deep blacks characteristic of OLED technology but also offer enhanced brightness and color vibrancy, making them suitable for a wider variety of lighting conditions. This combination of features allows QD-OLED displays to deliver exceptionally rich and dynamic visuals, setting a new standard in the realm of premium displays.\n\n**AORUS Exclusive Features**\u00a0\n\n* OLED Care - OLED Care runs AI-based presets in the background to optimize the OLED panel for longer life and prevent image sticking with minimal user interference. This unique feature includes pixel clean, static control, pixel shift, APL stabilization, sub-logo dim, and corner dim. You will get to enjoy the AORUS OLED gaming monitor just as the first time you unbox it!\n* Tactical Switch - It\u2019s a physical key for changing display size and resolution to 24.5\u201d and FHD, which is the most popular display mode for competitive gamers. Turn the key and be always ready to join the fight!\u00a0\n* Tactical Features - This helps gamers to enhance their gaming skills while in-game, including black equalizer 2.0, PiP/PbP, night vision, customized crosshair, time & counter, and the dashboard.\u00a0\n\n**3-Year Extended Warranty on QD OLED Monitor**\n\nEarlier this March, we announced the extended 3-year warranty to provide you with peace of mind and protection against potential panel image retention issues, ensuring a flawless gaming and entertainment experience over a longer period. This extended warranty applies to all QD OLED monitors mentioned above, so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything after purchasing.\u00a0If you\u2019re curious, you can find [the original news release here](https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2154#:~:text=In%20a%20commitment%20to%20delivering,FO27Q3%2C%20MO34WQC2%2C%20MO34WQC%20models.).\u00a0\n\n**What is firmware update? How to find the firmware update?**\u00a0\n\nThe monitor firmware updates can enhance and optimize the monitor functions and capabilities. You can always find the most recent firmware update on the corresponding product page on the GIGABYTE official website to help keep the monitor the most up-to-date. As of May 2024, there is a new firmware update available for [FO32U2 Pro](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2P/support#support-dl-firmware), [FO32U2](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2/support#support-dl-firmware), and [FO27Q3](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3/support#support-dl-firmware). This version (F03) fixes the issue with Pixel Clean not being able to auto-start at standby mode as noted on the website. Remember to update the firmware when you receive your new monitor and to check back regularly for any future updates as well.\u00a0\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAnything else that you\u2019d like to know?

With QD OLED, you get those deep, perfect blacks from OLED that make movies and games look insanely good, especially in dark scenes. But then it also uses quantum dots to make the colors pop even more and the screen brighter, which is awesome because sometimes OLEDs can be a bit dim in bright rooms.",
