This hybrid technology leverages the self-emissive properties of OLED panels, which are known for their ability to display perfect black levels and wide viewing angles. By incorporating quantum dots, QD OLED displays achieve a notable increase in brightness and a wider color spectrum compared to traditional OLEDs. These quantum dots are stimulated by blue light to emit precise colors, significantly enriching the visual experience with more saturated and vivid hues. As a result, QD OLED displays not only maintain the incredible contrast and deep blacks characteristic of OLED technology but also offer enhanced brightness and color vibrancy, making them suitable for a wider variety of lighting conditions. This combination of features allows QD-OLED displays to deliver exceptionally rich and dynamic visuals, setting a new standard in the realm of premium displays.\n\n**AORUS Exclusive Features**\u00a0\n\n* OLED Care - OLED Care runs AI-based presets in the background to optimize the OLED panel for longer life and prevent image sticking with minimal user interference. This unique feature includes pixel clean, static control, pixel shift, APL stabilization, sub-logo dim, and corner dim. You will get to enjoy the AORUS OLED gaming monitor just as the first time you unbox it!\n* Tactical Switch - It\u2019s a physical key for changing display size and resolution to 24.5\u201d and FHD, which is the most popular display mode for competitive gamers. Turn the key and be always ready to join the fight!\u00a0\n* Tactical Features - This helps gamers to enhance their gaming skills while in-game, including black equalizer 2.0, PiP/PbP, night vision, customized crosshair, time & counter, and the dashboard.\u00a0\n\n**3-Year Extended Warranty on QD OLED Monitor**\n\nEarlier this March, we announced the extended 3-year warranty to provide you with peace of mind and protection against potential panel image retention issues, ensuring a flawless gaming and entertainment experience over a longer period. This extended warranty applies to all QD OLED monitors mentioned above, so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything after purchasing.\u00a0If you\u2019re curious, you can find [the original news release here](https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2154#:~:text=In%20a%20commitment%20to%20delivering,FO27Q3%2C%20MO34WQC2%2C%20MO34WQC%20models.).\u00a0\n\n**What is firmware update? How to find the firmware update?**\u00a0\n\nThe monitor firmware updates can enhance and optimize the monitor functions and capabilities. You can always find the most recent firmware update on the corresponding product page on the GIGABYTE official website to help keep the monitor the most up-to-date. As of May 2024, there is a new firmware update available for [FO32U2 Pro](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2P/support#support-dl-firmware), [FO32U2](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2/support#support-dl-firmware), and [FO27Q3](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3/support#support-dl-firmware). This version (F03) fixes the issue with Pixel Clean not being able to auto-start at standby mode as noted on the website. Remember to update the firmware when you receive your new monitor and to check back regularly for any future updates as well.\u00a0\n\nAnything else that you\u2019d like to know? Ask the questions below under this post and we will help to answer. We can\u2019t wait to hear what you think!\u00a0",

            "I like the resolution switch. Big screen for immersion but small screen when you need to see all the details at once.",
            "Damn, NA residents eating good with giveaways as always",
            "QD OLED sounds super cool! Its like the best of both worlds when it comes to TV and monitor screens. With QD OLED, you get those deep, perfect blacks from OLED that make movies and games look insanely good, especially in dark scenes. But then it also uses quantum dots to make the colors pop even more and the screen brighter, which is awesome because sometimes OLEDs can be a bit dim in bright rooms.",
            "i like to get a 32 inch monitor, but any of those would be better because i am currently using at least 10 year old 27 inch LG monitor which probably is discontinued by now.",
            "I've only really seen OLED monitors at the store and never had the opportunity to use one myself. They look great, and the technology is awesome. I'm pretty excited about the future of OLED. \n\nGood luck to everyone entering!",
            "I'm honestly amazed by the quality of OLED monitors. Would be an insane jump from my 60 Hz 1080p monitor.",
            "OLED are the next level. I've never used one, but it's been my wish for a long time to get that kind of monitor.",
            "I would love a qd oled mainly due to the image sharpness. Whilst I've never had one, I've seen the panels in displays at stores, and they make me want one even more. I think the technology is pretty cool, and can only imagine the future of it.",
            "The jump from the TN panel I have to an OLED would be huge.  With the addition of the QD-OLED it would be even more amazing.  Image quality and color accuracy difference is amazing!!"

            "Sorry, but that's BS, right now parts are way better designed, what changed are prices for that designs. In top tier components there are cosmic designs, just take power color devil or sapphire nitro plus GPU line as most aesthetically pleasing and amazing looking designs. ASRock or Asus have the widest variety of motherboard designs, cooler master has some crazy cooler designs but not only cooler master, quite every brand has some unique look. Ram sticks are mostly ugly that's true but still looking better. And finishing on cases, GOD I LOVE FRACTAL NORTH, fractal has some of the most amazing cases available",
            "I don't know about the other present products but the  FE gtx cards looked so sick especially the Titan Vs and the gtx 1080s, now the AMD fe cards kinda fill in that void."
