If you have specific questions be easier to answer.\n\nAs far as tips, listen to cravings.  If craving something look up what nutrients you get from it.  Could be your body is lacking something it used to get from animal sources and then find a vegan source.",

            "Eating fish is not ok. A few reasons:\n- they suffer pain equally to mammals\n- they die a very slow death .. either crushed under the weight of other fish or suffocating to death\n- a lot of other animals (including dolphins) die as a consequence of you eating fish (bycatch)\n- a lot of fish comes from farms where they have a worse life than most other famed animals",
            "It's great you have the goal to become vegan! \nYou rock and you can do this, it has never been easier than now! \n\nOnce I made that choice, I directly transitioned to a vegan lifestyle, because I care about the animals and don't want them to be exploited. Doesn't matter if cow, chicken, pig, fish and so on. \nI watched documentaries, looked up media coverage of animal abuse in small, local farms and  watched documentaries of the atrocities in the fishing industry that did it to me.  \n\nVeganism is a movement to abolish animal exploitation, living a happy life doesn't mean it's okay to kill you. Would you kill your pets to eat them because you do it with love and they had a happy life? And would slowly suffocating them or crushing them under a weight seem good to you? \n\nThe marine ecosystems are about to collapse due to overfishing, there's not enough fish left for humans and the predatory marine animals. The population is in decline. \nI stopped eating tuna way before becoming vegan because my husband asked me: \"In 30 years, would you be okay to be one of those to answer why they went extinct by: 'Oh, well, I liked their taste'?\"\n\nTons of nets get lost each year from fishing boats, drifting as ghost nets through the ocean, polluting it with plastic and catching and killing all kinds of animals. From dolphins to turtles, from sharks to fish to whales. Those nets are hidden killers staying in the ocean for ages. \n\nFor salmon breeding, there are tons of other fish necessary to feed them. The salmon farms are polluting the fjords and spreading diseases, so many of those salmons look zombie like due to infections that let them rot away alive. That's not a happy life and they infect the local wild salmon. \n\nFish feel pain, have social structures and shouldn't be killed just for pleasure. \n\nIt's easy to replicate tastes in a plantbased diet. \n\nMeaty flavour: I use soy sauce or vegan Worcestershire sauce to marinade smoked tofu or soaked soy chunks/curls. \nI use lots of Turkish chicken seasoning or k\u00f6fte seasoning as well. \nFor fish, I use nori to season whatever I want to marinade as a fish replacement. You can do this with soy granulate for example to make those tasty tuna sandwiches without erasing a species. I have some of that right now in my fridge. \n\nI don't miss meat or fish the slightest tbh, because it's so easy to replicate the flavour without the suffering. \nThere's tons of good cheese alternatives, but your taste might need time to adjust. But it's worth it, as it means less suffering. \nMilk itself is easy to replace, there are so many different milk alternatives for every taste.\nVegan baking is fairly okay too, not much adjustment so far for me.\nI mostly use recipes from Zucker & Jagdwurst or Bianca Zapatka, they are available in English as well. \n\nLook at it as a journey: you start to explore cooking from a different angle, use new ingredients, experiment with stuff. That part was actually fun to me. A whole new food horizon, basically .\nYou won't lack anything.",
            "Fish are usually killed through suffocation. Nothing happy about that.",
            "Aside from what everyone has said about fish, eating fish is just not sustainable. Fish populations are plummeting. They can't recover from all the overfishing. \n\nIn terms of what you eat, definitely learn to cook. Follow some vegan youtube channels and follow along. Challenge yourself to make 10 vegan dishes that you really like. Once you have those in rotation, complete transition will be easy.",

            "So you want to be vegan but keep on eating fish? That'd make you a prescetarian tho and not a vegan. \n\nBesides you think it's okay to kill the fish and eat them because... they were happy once they were still alive? Did I get that right? Once they're dead and on your plate they can't be happily living their life anymore now can they? They were robbed of their life for you to be able to eat them after all.",
            "OP welcome to the vegan community!! \ud83e\udec2\n\nI want to request that you watch the documentary called, \"Seaspiracy\"! \ud83d\udc1f \ud83c\udfa5 \n\n I thought the same thing as you while I was transitioning, but Seaspiracy taught me a lot about the ocean and the life within it, and it's pretty devastating! \ud83d\udc94\n\nFor every fish caught that is the intended catch, there's at least 10 other animals that are caught as \"bycatch\" which can include turtles, penguins, seabirds, sharks, whales, and all the other beautiful marine animals that you likely know and love. Not to mention that a large majority of our large fish have been fished to extinction or are endangered! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI highly recommend the documentary called, \"Dominion\" to see what the animals go through, and it is like the first level of vegan bootcamp! Be warned, it's pure undercover slaughterhouse footage and will make you weep! Make sure to have some tissues ready to blow your nose and whipe tears! \ud83e\udd27\n\nAlso I'd like to say that if you have any questions that need answering, check out [https://yourveganfallacyis.com/en](https://yourveganfallacyis.com/en)  \ud83d\udcf1 \n\nIt helped me a lot when I had a lot of questions.

And the liquid will be your \"milk\" and the pulp is something called okara which can be used for baking or making biscuits or dough etc. :) There are lots of youtube videos to show you how to do it as well as what to do with the byproducts! You can even make tofu out of that! And this process works for beans/nuts/lentils as well :) I made pumpkin seed tofu through this exact process!
