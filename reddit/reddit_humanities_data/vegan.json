        "content": "Some of these might be unusual but wanted to share\n\n1.) Vegan food doesn't go bad as easily, there has been times where my fridge has stopped working or lost power overnight I didn't notice. Usually if the fridge had meat or dairy in it I assume you would just have to chuck it all away. But being vegan I just plugged the fridge back in and everything was fine.\n\n  \n2.) Your house doesn't stink. I've been in peoples houses who eat meat/dairy and you can tell if its been a couple days since they took out the rubbish since their bin smells so bad. Personally I only take out my rubbish once a week or sometimes like 10 days and it doesn't smell. \n\n  \n3.) Opens your eyes to how much people just don't care. For some reason people are generally rude to vegans in my experience. Like people making fun of you for being vegan and just being hateful.\n\n  \n4.) So much healthier I have IBS so stomach pain, rushing to the bathroom is pretty common for me but it's nothing like before I went vegan still bad but WAY  better.\n\n  \n5.) More creative with cooking, you want chocolate? Maybe you have limited options at the grocery store so you decide to make your own (something I did today :)\n\n  \nInterested to hear others benefits too",

I can just make a batch of naan bread out of basically nothing whenever I want some!\n\nOne big difference i noticed was dishes. I used to hate having to clean solidified fat off a frying pan every time, but you never get that with vegan food (even doing a big fry-up).",

I also get less stomach issues and I have a lot more energy. I take more time to manage my food and plan out my meals (I am also gluten free due to non coeliac gluten intolerance) and being vegan forces me to be more imaginative with food.",

I became vegetarian 4 years ago,  and Vegan for 6 months. In the beginning it was a little bit tough to find some replacement due to lack of offer in the market. But, I survived \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. After sometime of being vegan here I noticed that here there is not a vegan grocery store that offers wide range of products, what makes things a little bit difficult for vegans and vegetarians like me. With that I decided to open a vegan grocery store which will not only a grocery, it will be also a community for vegans and vegetarians to feel comfortable when shopping. Here comes the question, do you think that the vegan community is prone to help or support a vegan business to develop? ",
