        "content": "My friend and I are on vacation in Turkey. Everything was going great. Then yesterday we had an horse riding excursion on the beach. We'd had a couple of drinks beforehand and was joking around. My friend suddenly started acting strange and started snapping at everything I said. I carried on joking with her thinking nothing of it and then she suddenly shouted at me, got up and walked off. I did the excursion on my own. When I finished, I got back to the place and looked for her but she was nowhere to be found. She then started sending me messages saying I'd annoyed her and then continued to do the horse riding without following her and we got in a massive argument via text. When I went up to the room, we both had a big row and said some really nasty things to each other and she packed her case and left. Her mum has contacted me to say she is staying in a different hotel and is in a really low mood. I've tried reaching out to her but she's blocked me in everything and I can't contact her. We have four days left before we go home. Has something like this happened to anyone else and did it get resolved?",

            "Yeah, it's happened to me once, just over ten years ago. A friend and I were travelling and he was doing things that were pissing me off and I was doing things that were pissing him off. After trying to talk about it, I realised that we saw things so differently that talking about it wasn't helping, in fact it was making things worse. I decided that getting some space between us would be a good idea so I moved to different accommodation thinking it would only be for a few days. I was surprised by what happened over the next few days but I felt so much better not being in my friend's presence. I met some amazing people, forgot about all the shit that was going on with my friend and just enjoyed my time in a foreign country. \n\nA few days passed and I was having lunch in a cafe by myself looking out onto the street watching the world go by. My friend walked past and as we noticed each other he stopped. I asked how he was and he said he was okay. He asked me the same and I told him that I was also okay. It was a very brief encounter and he carried on his way. It was at that moment that I realised I was having more fun doing things without him than I was with him. I continued to travel on my own and I guess he did the same. We've never seen or spoken to each other since.",
            "Reach out to her mother and confirm she is ok; tell the mom she has blocked you and you just want to confirm for safety. If you feel ok with it, tell the mom you are open to your friend reaching out if she needs help or wants to talk before going home.\n\nThen do your thing. \n\nThe way you described what happened your friend may have had some anxiety/low mood that started or flared with the travel. Or, something you may have said joking/innocently hit very wrong but you did not realize (possible based on school+joking+suddenly snappish). Can\u2019t know more unless you share what she shouted at you before walking away. \n\nYou know your friend better to know if they would have wanted you to come after them immediately to hash it out. Only you and she know what microfrustrations/pet peeves got aired out when back at the hotel.\n\nHowever, all you can do now is confirm she is safe and accept that this might need to be worked out back home. \n\nSome people just don\u2019t travel well together. I have friends that are very good ones, but I would never travel with. I have friends I am not as consistently close with/as long as friends with who travel great.\n\nFinal though - if this is a friend who has previously emotionally manipulated you (hot/cold suddenly, pouts off if not getting their way, etc) in the past\u2026might be best to let this be the end.",

            "Hmmmmmm. I\u2019d text her mum. Tell her you\u2019ve been blocked on everything. Ask her to pass on the message \u2018I\u2019m sad you felt like you had to leave. I\u2019d like to resolve this with you. It would be great if you came back so we could talk\u2019.",
            "Yes! It's actually quite normal to fall out as you're both out of your comfort zone and travelling is stressful. She does seem to have overreacted big time but that may be because her expectations of travelling were very different.... Just give yourself some time alone to calm down and then try to have a chat without putting blame on anyone. My friend and I ended up having the best night out after falling out.",
            "Enjoy having the hotel room to yourself, book on a tour, maybe chat to some other tourists round the pool/at the bar. If she's blocked you, then there's not much you can do until she stops sulking, so at least try to enjoy what's left of your trip.",

            "So... we were diving as a trio, my wife, our friend and me. I'm the most experienced diver with about 250+ dives, divemaster, rescue diver, etc. They both had *maybe* 10 dives each. We're diving in Bonaire where they don't really regulate anything. There's no guides, you just pick up your tanks, drive yourself to a site, then enter the water. So I'm in charge.\n\nAnyway, we spend about an hour diving, see some cool shit and suddenly he signals \"Low on air, I'm going deeper\" and decides to head out on his own. This is... incredible. Like jaw droppingly the stupidest thing I've ever seen. He swims off without looking back, he's not narced we're too shallow for that, he's just fucking stupid. My wife has plenty of air and signals \"Should I go after him,\" and I write on my slate ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT because I'm low on air and then we'd have two divers who are operating independently without any means of coordination.\n\nWife and I surface and I'm thinking 'shit, who do we contact, can we ask other divers around for help,' and about five minutes later he surfaces and says \"Hey, that was great.\" We're not done with the holiday, we've got three or four days together and he's primarily my wife's friend. I'm trying to think of all the ways I can communicate just how bad this was without using every fucking curseword in the book, but I lose it on him.\n\nAfter being upset with the words I've chosen to elucidate the absolute stupidity of his actions he apologizes, buys us drinks, and we're all good.\n\nNever diving with that dude again, holy shit.",
            "Yes, I did a week away with a friend, we had a huge argument on the first day just after arriving in destination. I had insisted on separate rooms as I had travelled with her before and knew I needed some space as she loved to control every minute. She sent me a long text pointing out all of my shortcomings and how she expected me to act. I blocked her , switched my room to the other side of the resort, changed my seat location for the flight home and enjoyed my week away. It's been more than 3 years and we have not spoken another word to each other."

        "content": "I went through a TSA check yesterday before a flight, and my MacBook Air was missing when I went to retrieve it from a bin. There was a different unaccounted for laptop, so it may have been that someone mistakenly took it. I immediately told TSA and filed a police report. After exhausting my other options, I remembered to check Find My, but my flight was leaving, and I didn\u2019t have time to search the area where it was showing up in the airport. Police did very little even when I told them the area where it was in the airport, though I suspect that\u2019s for good legal reasons.\n\nAnyway, the laptop now is in the Philippines. It is now somewhere near Carmen in the Davao del Norte Province. Is there anything I can do to get TSA, DOT, or police to review footage to determine who took the laptop? Is there anything I can do to try to get my laptop back other than relying on the person with it to text my number? (I\u2019ve placed the laptop on lost mode.)\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve appreciated reading a bunch of your responses. Even when writing this post, I don\u2019t think that I expected to be able to find a way to retrieve my laptop, but at least thinking about possible solutions and reading what everyone has said has helped me process a lot of the anger I was feeling and find peace. Thanks again, everyone.",

TSA/DOT/US-based police have no authority to pursue whomever took it of course, and chances are police in the Philippines won't exert themselves too much to assist either.  However: the staff at HNL airport should be able to provide you with camera footage of who walked off with it.  (Cameras at airports are generally \"owned\" by an operations or security department separate from the police and TSA.  Track down *their* number.)  \n\n\nFilipinos are super-active on Facebook; my wife is one of them, and is from Cebu City a short drive to the south.  If you can send me the Find My location and/or footage of whomever took it, I will ask her to reach out to Pinoys in that area.  I think she has family up near Carmen.",
