        "content": "For context, I\u2019ve been married to my husband for a year. We have a toddler. I was a SAHM and did all of the childcare and household chores. I got a new job a week ago. Yay! I wanted to celebrate by taking a weekend overnight solo trip while my husband is away on a business trip. My toddler would be with my parents for the night. I\u2019d be paying for the trip myself with a small bit of the savings I had from when I worked shortly before giving birth. \n\nI solo traveled domestically and internationally before dating my husband and even while dating him! He was totally ok with it. I never did when we were married though. We\u2019d usually take trips together.\n\nI just feel really burnt out and a little resentful. I feel like I deserve a break. My husband is concerned about my safety, but we went to college together in that area and it\u2019s super safe. Am I silly for wanting to do this?",

            "Absolutely not weird. I'm married and travel solo all the time my husband encouragement. He knows it makes me happy, and we keep in touch. I always update him with details of where I am staying and when I'm moving locations. Just do it - you deserve it :)",
            "Do it!!! \n\nI've been gifted a trip by my husband during my last week of maternity leave before returning to work. He'll have both of toddler and infant during that week. He knows that I do a lot and that traveling helps me recenter.",
            "In the very beginning of our relationship it felt important to do everything together. Getting older and maturing is about finding hobbies and things that make you happy that you may do on your own.",
            "I do not think you are silly. I think you need to recharge your batteries however you can. Enjoy!",
            "You should absolutely do it. Recently my wife took a solo trip to San Diego and I took one to Kansas City. We'll always enjoy traveling together but not having to worry about the house, plants, pets etc. while we are both gone is really nice.",
            "Not weird in slightest. My husband is ecstatic when I travel by myself or with friends and he doesn\u2019t have to go. I love to travel, he doesn\u2019t. Have a conversation about what will allay his fears and if his requests are reasonable, then do it. (I.e. my H usually likes me to shoot him a text once a day, just so he knows I\u2019m alive, lol)",
            "I\u2019ve been married for 31 years and have always travelled solo, as well as with my husband. Shared trips are wonderful but solo trips are absolutely magical, IME. The opportunity to shed responsibility and do exactly what pleases or intrigues you and only you is fantastic. Highly recommend. \n\n(We have also found that each of us going our own way every so often is great for our marriage.)",
            "Husband here. If my SAHM wife ever tells me she wants to travel solo for a few days I\u2019d take those days off from work to stay with our 2 year old so she won\u2019t have to worry about leaving her with grandparents.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad. You\u2019re not JUST a mum, you\u2019re a person too and you rock.",
            "Doesn't sound like a big deal to me. Go have fun.",
            "Not weird at all. I used to babysit overnight for moms who would take a night or a weekend away while the father was somewhere else (a work trip or visiting family). They often came back feeling refreshed. Enjoy your trip!!"

Walking down random side streets, checking out little parks or shops or other things that catch my attention.

You can get the train back to London Bridge from Blackheath in 15 mins. Others are Hampstead, Primrose Hill, Camden. Enjoy!",
            "The City is great - so much random history. I used to quite often walk from Old Street to Blackfriars taking whichever route took my fancy at the time and found so many random interesting things - old graveyards, churches with famous art, bits of the London wall, Postman's Park etc. There's even a Mithraeum.",
