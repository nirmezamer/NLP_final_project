This subreddit is meant to be a literal safe space from that divisive stuff.\n\nQ?: \"Isn't that censorship!?\"  - Yes, it literally is. By design. If you don't like that, make a post on /r/AmItheAssHole\n\nThis is a place to share Uplifting News stories, and **AUTHENTIC** examples of humanity or stories of people helping others, or of good things happening to fellow humans on our planet without any affiliation or care of race/color/creed/gender/sexuality/politicalaffiliation and without the plethora of well paid influences/influencers meddling in attempts to further their well paid narratives.\n\nBeen that way since 2012 and beyond!\n\n&#x200B;",

This post was meant to alleviate some blatant and obviously lazy attempts at censoring and dictating discussion, but this isn't gonna happen here. \n\nSpeak your mind, no harm no foul. The goal is to bring people together and foster dialogue... Not to try to squash certain people's opinions or thoughts. But any opinions that disagree with this concept are welcome as well, so long as they don't violate Rule #1 here!  Love!",

            "I grew up in a poverty in Africa and the one thing that struck me when I visited many years ago was the smile on peoples faces. It was community oriented, neighbours became your close friends and everyone does their part to help those around them. Family is also far more important, often living up within close proximity raising and feeding the kids together. If you knock on someones house and tell them youre hungry, theyll likely feed you whatever little they have.",
            "Happiness is dependent on many close relationships.\n\nBecoming wealthier means smaller families, not living with extended families or villages, moving around city to city. Not having time for constant socializing with your close community, etc.",
            "Valuing your childs time with you instead of valuing your childs future career seems like happier families are born and raised in general. If we center our lives around making money, then we get a country of people who dont value eachother. They are just convinced they need to grind for the sake of a few rich people living with spoils they dont need. The math is undeniable. Every human can eat and sleep and work, they just locked out humans from doing it freely and put a price tag on peoples lives. Its hard for some poorly educated americans to believe other countries are much better, just because we strive for things WE DONT NEED. And they strive for, the PEOPLE AROUND THEM.",

            "Wouldnt happiness be tied to the Cost of Living? If the COL is low then little money is needed for the essentials and individual happiness becomes easier to achieve. If the COL is high then the essentials are harder to achieve and life is a daily struggle just to exist. So find destinations with low COL and you will invariably find people who are content and comfortable with life and have no unrealistic expectations.",
