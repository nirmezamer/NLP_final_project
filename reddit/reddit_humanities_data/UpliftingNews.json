This subreddit is meant to be a literal safe space from that divisive stuff.\n\nQ?: \"Isn't that censorship!?\"  - Yes, it literally is. By design. If you don't like that, make a post on /r/AmItheAssHole\n\nThis is a place to share Uplifting News stories, and **AUTHENTIC** examples of humanity or stories of people helping others, or of good things happening to fellow humans on our planet without any affiliation or care of race/color/creed/gender/sexuality/politicalaffiliation and without the plethora of well paid influences/influencers meddling in attempts to further their well paid narratives.\n\nBeen that way since 2012 and beyond!\n\n&#x200B;",

            "We all live in a weird world today, full of awareness but also censorship. This post was meant to alleviate some blatant and obviously lazy attempts at censoring and dictating discussion, but this isn't gonna happen here. \n\nSpeak your mind, no harm no foul. The goal is to bring people together and foster dialogue... Not to try to squash certain people's opinions or thoughts. But any opinions that disagree with this concept are welcome as well, so long as they don't violate Rule #1 here!  Love!",
            "How do you handle things that shouldn't be political, but people make them political by being assholes?\n\nFor example: when insulin became far more affordable in the US. That's about as objective as you can get when it comes to good news. But on every post about it I've ever seen, there are assholes who are talking about how big government is intruding on the rights of private corporations, and how it's going to stifle innovation, etc., etc.\n\nWould a post about insulin prices being capped then be removed because it's \"political?\"",
            "Wanting to be non-divisive is valid but either:\n\nA. You do extreme enforcement and the only thing allowed becomes stories about dogs getting wheelchairs.\n\nB. You try to enforce based on some subjective line and get accused of the censorship itself having a political agenda... which it inevitably will. This just becomes \"political posts are allowed unless they're contentious around the moderators' politics\".\n\nThat's just the reality of trying to be apolitical.",
            "Could you provide a few examples of posts you would and wouldn't remove?  Just curious.",
            "Are the following example headlines political?\n\n* Federal government announces new regulation that landlords can't discriminate against LGBT tenants\n* Taiwan legalizes gay marriage\n* Pay gap between white and black earners reaches historical low in the US\n* Ukraine regains territory in South\n* US Energy transitioning to renewables faster than originally estimated",
            "The most meaningful good news will always intersect with politics. \n\nWhen laws, politics, or the lack thereof infringe on the rights, health, and safety of people, animals, and the planet \u2014 the most meaningful good news will come from people working to right those wrongs.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider this rule.",
            "There are a lot of uplifting topics that could be considered political. Unless what is off limits is clearly defined, this sub will just have dog videos.",
            "The desire to go down the front page flagging everything is high.\n\n- Coral reef restoration? I dunno, seems like that's infringing on the safe space for the oil tycoons, who are protected under their political affiliation and creed.\n\n- An Arizona governor did what to a foreign owned farm? Anything a governor does is political.\n\n- A man spent 44 years in prison after a wrongful conviction? Uh oh, people might ask why that could occur, or who's responsible, or if there was injustice in the appeals. Better scrub it.\n\n- The US economy got more jobs? That's an instaban. Super political.  \n\n- Sweden joined NATO? I thought this was an apolitical space. Putin says this is WRONG and NOT UPLIFTING.",
            "This will be difficult to both communicate and implement.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n- Mark Cuban offers free prescription drugs: incredibly political because of extremely high drug prices in the US \n\n- ex-felon exonerated: political bc of US criminal justice system\n\n- country X legalizes gay marriage\n\nEtc etc.",
