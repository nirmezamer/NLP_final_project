        "content": "**Mortals! You have drawn the ire of the head mod, and will now face judgement for your crimes!**\n\n*ominous thunder crackling sounds intensify*\n\n**end of classic mod power trip. Beginning of actual mod talk.**\n\nAhem, hello! You may have seen me around or on the side bar, 99% of the people here have probably never seen me post on the subreddit, so before this gets going, a brief introduction. I'm Caek, your head mod (supposedly), and was the poor bastard who happened to be second in command (supposedly) when this place was founded (supposedly) as a branch off of AlternateHistory - not the topic, the forum. That OG founder-mod god king was the one who was meant to be doing the main mod work whilst I did all the work on the glorious back end of things to get things like the flair system and the like together, but alas they went inactive and left the position, ultimately catapulting me to the head mod slot. I don't really see myself as a mod-mod, but more like...the repairman, working behind the scenes to keep the mechanical bits of the subreddit working. \n\nSorta. Reddit going over to new reddit has made my life a living hell with that since old reddit is king, but you get the jist of it. Normally, I just do stuff in the background and take no noticeable actions: I flair posts, I do little adjustments here and there, that sort of thing. Lo and behold, years of peace and prosperity (supposedly) follow. \n\nThe thing is, this is one of those times that needs the head mod to actually step up to the table, because it seems like this little cute baby subreddit has somehow grown into an absolute dumpster fire over the last few days. Due to, uh, *issues* with mod team communication (new reddit has the messenger, old reddit has the discussion tab in the mod panel, lo and behold, a mod team split over the two = left hand literally does not know what the right hand is doing), I actually only found out this place was burning down when I found out about it over on Subreddit Drama. The popcorn doesn't taste as nice when you realize it's your sub that's the drama mine (*supposedly*), but that got the ball rolling, and I've spent some time since then going through what I can, chatting with the rest of the mod team, and getting to grips with what the hell has happened to this house. \n\nYou know those situations that come up so rarely on reddit, where there's a huge problem and some super inactive head mod comes back to sort it out? \n\nYeah, this is going to be one of those times. \n\nAfter taking stock with the mod team, I've tried to assemble something of a plan. \n\nSo let's sit back, call this a fireside, and talk. \n\n**The problems:**\n\nA) **The rules on the side bar are, put bluntly, a mess.** Many of these are left overs from the day when the subreddit was originally founded, which means they were meant for a community looking for a backup place to post and to talk about outages for AlternateHistory, the forum, rather than an actual alternate history community in its own right. Some have changed a bit along the way, but most aren't that different from their original form (which for reference you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/L8YC5jH.png)) when we brought them over from the forum. That's a problem, because...well, the subreddit has grown up into its own thing at this point and needs its own set of rules. This isn't a bulletin board, after all, and what works for AlternateHistory.com isn't guaranteed to work for /r/AlternateHistory. You've got mods with good intentions enforcing old rules that haven't been looked at in ages, and that's a disaster waiting to happen; the biggest surprise about this whole situation is that it didn't happen sooner. \n\nB) **The disunity of the mod staff is, suffice to say, a significant problem.** Considering the size of the subreddit (and the topic material, which let's not mess around here, is like playing with fireworks at a gas station), twelve mods is..not exactly sufficient for the task at hand, and a fair number are inactive. Then add in the communications issues between new and old reddit, and you get a situation where the subreddit effectively has multiple teams of moderators - you've got a team on new reddit and a team on old reddit, neither of which is talking to the other, with the possibility of seperate interpretation of the rules. This is the cause of the problem with posts being removed, approved, then removed again - Mod A thinks its bad and removes it, Mod B thinks its okay and puts it back up, Mod A comes back and removes it again. The moderation machine is running, but the two sides aren't talking to one another, which means that there's no shared approach of how to handle the rules and a situation, which means you get what looks like mixed signals at best or two-faced-moderation at worst. \n\nThis is something we're going to work on; part of the hope here is to bring the discussion of moderator actions into the open - our view of the rules and our understanding of them is not something that should be kept in the dark, leaving posters guessing as to what is or isn't a violation of rule 1 or rule 8, for example. Combined with the (desperately needing an overhaul) rule set on the side, I probably don't even need to explain where the issues are coming from - bad rules open to interpretation being implemented by multiple different interpreters on the same reader base = \"what the actual fuck is going on\" becomes a very real sentiment, and one that I share.\n\n\"But head mod, you dastardly wretch, soon to go under the guillotine of the revolution! You've just listed the problems, not the solution!\"\n\nThat's where C comes in.\n\n**Where C Comes In.**\n\nThere's an awfully fitting quote from Battlestar Galactica that can slot right in here: \n\n> There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.\n\nThat's where problems A and B meet. When the people making the rules for the community, interpreting the rules for actions and then enforcing them on the guilty are the same, then you get the result where the community as a whole becomes the guilty; we're not at that level, but it isn't hard to see how the current road could get us there. That's the problem as far as I can see it, and the solution is multifaceted.\n\nA) **Expand the moderation staff** - we're looking out for people who are active and willing to join the team. You don't necessarily have to throw your hat into the ring - we're looking out for high effort posters and the like, the kind of users that don't just throw the moderator stick around, but also set a good example as to what a \"good\" poster should be like. Part of this effort will also be to unite the moderation team as well, and make sure that all members are back on the same page; call this an official \"we dun fucked up\" notification from the moderation. We'll try and be better on that front...\n\nB) **...and part of being better on that is this: a re-examination of the rules**. Those things are probably the real guilty party here in that they're a list that really needs to be looked through and reexamined; some of them were made with good intentions but implemented in relatively poor ways (Rule 8, which I'll be talking about in a moment), others are vague (rule 1, which requires interpretation of what \"alternate history\" actually is - does that mean double blind what ifs, ASB scenarios, political ones?), to say nothing of the basically hidden /r/alternatehistory wiki which is meant to contain the FAQ. This all needs review. \n\nAnd who gets to help us review it? \n\nWhy, you do. \n\nC) **Say hello to the open forum - the other announcement that went up alongside this one, the first ever Friday Forum**. This place originally branched off of Alternate History, a bulletin board which has a thread on it for discussing moderator actions, the rules, general forum conditions and the like. If that can work for a bulletin board, it can work for a subreddit. This isn't going to be run by polls or anything (that just invites the risk of us getting mobbed by people from other subreddits casting votes without backing them up in discussion), but will provide an open place for everyone to talk about the situations going on in the reddit, about the nature of the rules, so forth and so on. \n\nThe goal of the Friday Forum will be to create an environment where everyone can talk to the moderation team (and debate the rules with each other, too) on an even footing; there's obviously going to be moderation in there (please don't post something illegal), but it should be a place where people can talk to each other on an even footing - if you want to say that a rule is trash, that is the place to say it. It is an open discussion for the subreddit, and the moderation will be watching to see where we can improve, what rules might need to be changed, what content should or should not be allowed, how the rules should be interpreted. At the same time, it allows the mod team to try and explain the logic of their view of the rules, and hopefully, get everyone onto the same page - as much for the mod team as for the userbase, no more divided house, but a unified front that will try and make this place grow beyond its roots and become the best place for alternate history on reddit (supposedly). Try not to shoot each other. \n\n**This post is huge, but tl;dr:** \n\nA) There obviously needs to be some discussion about the rules, and by golly, we're gonna have it. \n\nB) The mod team is going to get its act together and get everyone back into the same boat.\n\nC) Some of the rules need to go, others need to be clarified. The largest candidates for discussion here are Rule 1 and Rule 8, which both have a huge slack of interpretation to figure out; rather than have this take place behind closed doors, we're gonna do it in public in the new Friday Forum megathread, which will happen weekly from now on. I'll continue this topic there. \n\nI'll leave the comments here open, because honestly, they shouldn't be locked even on an announcement like this. If there's something wrong or you have suggestions for the team, go for it...but they're probably better off going into the actual Friday Forum thread - come on over!",

        "content": "So! It has been nearly a full week since the Friday Forum Megathread went up, and there's been plenty of discussion, both here and in the moderator channels (much of which has basically been quoted into the comments already - there's no spooky shadow cabal here), and now that things have settled down (both inside and outside of the thread), it seems time for an update. A lot of stuff was talked about, some issues raised that I and the team had never considered, good points and the like. I've read through the thread again, and this appears to be the list of thoughts:\n\n**A) The most upvoted issue was a request to clarify Rule 6, which in its current form reads like this:**\n> No bad faith posts or comments. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into indulging in political mudslinging is banned.\n\nThe general purpose of that rule is to try and avoid, uh, *intensive* discussion on modern day hot topic issues, especially since it is very easy to craft a scenario that is basically the debate-equivalent of napalm. For the most part, there seems to be an agreement that the rule is necessary to keep the sub healthy, and this view is shared by the moderator team; as a result, Rule 6 will most likely be staying, but in an altered form. Here's some possibilities based on various lines of discussion:\n\n**A1**: No posts for the purpose of bad faith, or with the appearance of looking for a fight/bad faith discussion. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into a fight is banned. This is primarily in regard to asking questions about scenarios and comments, rather than full post scenarios that, by their nature, can lead unavoidably into certain topics that might get heated.\n\nThis is a clarification of what \"bad faith\" actually means - not so much for a discussion, but posting for the sake of throwing down with whoever you want to throw down with. It states the scope of the rule as being something that mainly deals with the smaller stuff, like questions, small scenarios, general what ifs and comments. Large scenarios would be relatively protected under this clarification; alternate history scenarios can end up dealing with some genuinely spooky stuff in their own right (ask our cousins over on /r/tnomod, for example) but that's just a reality of the genre for the most part. Someone writing a scenario where World War III becomes a thing is basically writing about the mass death of millions of people in nuclear war, which is certainly a spicy topic, but a pretty unavoidable part of the scenario. The same goes for something like, say a Children of Men style scenario with mass infertility, or an ISOT, which takes a nation and transplants them to a new location, era or world entirely, to say nothing of much more grounded scenarios involving groups like the KKK and the like, violent uprisings with equally violent attempts to suppress them, so forth and so on - alternate history and other speculative fiction is always one of those things where you need to separate the writer from their work, and this reinterpretation of Rule 6 provides room for that.\n\n**A2**: No posts for the purpose of bad faith, or with the appearance of looking for a fight/bad faith discussion. The creation of posts or comments which are designed for the sole purpose of baiting users into a fight is banned. This is primarily in regard to asking questions about scenarios and comments, rather than full post scenarios that, by their nature, can lead unavoidably into certain topics that might get heated. To avoid the risk of heated discussion, anything political within the last ten years (since 2014) is considered to be off-limits.\n\nThat version is the same as the first, but with an additional clause: to avoid getting too much into current, real world affairs, a hard capw ould be placed to cut recent happenings from the sub - anything political after the year 2014 would be considered off topic, advancing forward with each new year. That'd open the door for a wide variety of political tales (ie, things to do with the Bush or Obama years would be completely fine) without getting into current issues which are usually the biggest source of political discussion; few people find it fun getting into a heated discussion about Al Gore or Dukakis. This is a relatively heavy handed approach, but it is also a very neat one in what is considered to be \"political\": no trawling through people's posts to try and determine what angle they might be coming from, no squinting to see what might be meant, just a clean cut time stamp, before which things are allowed, after which they are not. This is probably the most predictable option for moderation purposes.\n\n**A3**: No bad faith discussions, or discussions which could be interpreted as being in the purpose of bad faith, whether for baiting users into heated discussion or for trolling.\n\nThis is the simplest version of the rule, cutting back to the core of Rule 6, but I also find it to be the most...vague. It removes the political side from consideration - any topic that could be considered to be a bad faith one (ie, if OP posts a what if and then starts to try and throw down with everyone that comes in to explain that, no, Siam could not invent the nuclear bomb in 561 AD and their wank scenario has become a full blown bukkake) depending on the action of people inside the thread. It is, like rule 2, predictable, but I find that it could result in discussions that were promising but which unfortunately head to the gutter to end up being deemed bad faith, even if the core idea has merit.\n\nAnd of course, there's **A4: Your suggestion here, on this blank sheet of paper.** There's still room for discussion on this.\n\n**B) Rule 8 was a rule that I myself was iffy on, but seems to be deemed to be more or less acceptable in its current form; generally discussion seems to show that it needs tweaks, not replacement.** Here's the rule in its current form:\n\n> No \"What If\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What If\" questions (What Would, How Would, etc included), shitposts, and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Two violations will result in a permanent ban. Note that this applies specifically to questions, which are more suited to other subs - well-built scenarios that simply use \"What If\" in the title are allowed.\n\nWith the core of the rule being okay, let's look at the edges: the general problem that people mention (that What if scenarios are the bedrock of the genre) is entirely true, but there's also the understanding that it does protect against low quality posting, which used to be a significant issue on the subreddit in the past...but what is a shitpost is a very, very good question. Here's a set of possible alternate versions of the rule:\n\n**B1**: No non-scenario \"What if\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What if\" questions (What Would, How Would, etc included), shitposts, and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban.\n\nThis is basically maintaining the rule in its current form, but streamlining it for clarity - it's function remains the same, but it makes it clear that scenarios that use What If in their title and the like are allowed. It doesn't really change too much, however, so in comes...\n\n**B2**: No non-scenario \"What if\" questions, shitposts, or memes. \"What if\" questions (posts that ask a question without much input from the original poster: please put a paragraph or preferably more of your own thoughts), shitposts (low effort scenarios meant more for memetic value than for actual discussion), and memes are not allowed to be posted on this subreddit, please redirect your posts to the appropriate subreddits. Repeated violations will result in a permanent ban.\n\n...another version of the rule, which does clarify the nature of Rule 8 - it is meant to ward off questions or posts that not that much thought went into, the kind of spur of the moment sort of posts that people come up with as a single thought and put out onto the sub rather than actual scenarios they've sat down and considered for a while. It basically expects you to at least seed the discussion with some content to get it going, show that you've got an actual interest in the answers coming in, so forth and so on. This is more like how I'd expect the rule to function (blank posting goes out the door, but meatier what ifs are allowed to remain unharmed and are welcomed back into the general discussion habit of the sub), working less like an executioner and more like a doorman.\n\nAgain, **B3 - your suggestion here**.\n\n**C) Future History - does it count as alternate history? Generally speaking, this one is still up in the air, but we're starting to get somewhere on this one**: future history scenarios are allowed over on the mothership of AlternateHistory, and they've always been a part of this subreddit from the absolute beginning. Speaking for myself, I'm up for allowing them to remain - if there's no further discussion on this topic, the rules will be amended to make it clear that future history scenarios are allowed, but they might be confined to a certain day of the week to allow for the rest to handle the more bread and butter topics of the genre. Again, active discussion here.\n\n**D) Issues with the Moderation Team - This was a big one that came up in multiple posts, and it has been settled**: having taken detailed stock of the events that transpired over the last two weeks with the rest of the moderation team (helpfully summarized by Samurai [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateHistory/comments/1dfww15/the_first_friday_forum_megathread/l8n5rxi/)), the matter was put to an internal vote amongst the moderation team; TheRtHonLaqueesha no longer commanded the respect or support of the rest of the moderation team, their judgements were deemed to be in error, and so they had to go. As I was the only one with the power as the most senior mod (ominous thunder crackling intensifies), I carried out their wishes and those of the majority of posters; they have been removed from the mod team, and they will not be coming back. We are still actively shopping for additional moderators, and have a number of promising candidates waiting in the wings - we're especially looking out for people in varied time zones, ensuring that there's always a mod online to make sure that things are running nicely and thus always able to settle down any issues before they might get out of hand; if people start fighting in the comments, it helps to get someone in to tell them to chill out at the start of things rather than a few hours later after they've both started throwing death threats or something. We'll have more about this in a future day of discussion.\n\n**E) Mapchat and you, or the minimum quality of images posted to the sub - this one's a bit of a recurring mention in the chat, especially over the last few hours.** MapChart isn't the prettiest mapping tool around, but for many it might be the only tool that you have; this comes under Rule 4, right here:\n\n> Low-effort submissions will be removed by the mods. The content considered low-effort includes maps made solely in \u201cmap-painting\u201d programs like MapChart, simple Google service edits (like Maps or Earth) without a fairly detailed scenario, and AI generated content. Also, low-quality submissions (i.e. those w/ high pixelation or compression) are liable to be removed. Don't post GIFs of still images. Usage of Imgur or the native Reddit client for image uploads is preferred.\n\nThis is, if there's no complaints, going to be amended to read like this:\n\n> Low-effort submissions will be removed by the mods. The content considered low-effort includes maps made solely in \u201cmap-painting\u201d programs like MapChart and simple Google service edits (like Maps or Earth) without a fairly detailed scenario, and AI generated content. Also, low-quality submissions (i.e. those w/ high pixelation or compression) are liable to be removed. Don't post GIFs of still images. Usage of Imgur or the native Reddit client for image uploads is preferred.\n\nIt's a small change, but the middle clause has been adjusted - if your MapChart image has an accompanying scenario to go with it, then it will be allowed. Not everyone has access to a desktop computer to allow them to use better tools than that, or might be posting from mobile whilst away from a desk with a fully written out scenario, but no software to map with. Those kind of situations make me feel that it'd be unfair for their posts to be removed on the grounds of just not using the right software to map with - as long as you're not trying to depict the intricate details of your fifteen sided Swiss civil war through the wonders of burnt toast, then you should be allowed some leniency for the mapping software you use. The other rules about images from games and the like still stands, though. Come on, I know that if you're playing HoI4 that you can probably load paint up or something with a WorldA template map.\n\nSpeaking of WorldA and other template maps, there might be a resources tab coming to the side bar sometime soon, containing various templates and the like for maps, so forth and so on. If this is accepted by the mappers over on AlternateHistory (who often create these base maps), then they'll be a readily available source of resources for making maps of your own for your scenarios.\n\n**F) ASB Scenarios - ah, one of the most used flairs in concept but not in actuality, ASB means Alien Space Bats, generally referring to the \"impossible\" scenarios that require magic** (like So Dies the Fire), very unusual points of departure (ie, the World War series with an alien invasion in the midst of WW2), geographic what ifs (ie, the presence of extra continents and things like that) and other stories that are generally not the result of random chance or human action. Booth slipping with the gun and popping Mary Lincoln in the back of the head is not ASB, but her spitting out the bullet to reveal she's actually a vampire or something would be. ASB posts should be tagged with the corresponding flair (please don't take this as a cue to say that any scenario you disagree with is ASB - it depends primarily whether it depends on those above traits), but will be available. If Australia suddenly appears in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in 1500 AD, then that's an ASB scenario (actually called an ISOT but those are ASB, so it is what it is). These scenarios are allowed, and will be removed from the wording of Rule 1, which is currently this...\n\n> Work must be alternate history. All works must be partially or entirely fictional with a basis in real-world history. However, fantasy and other paranormal or magical content is prohibited.\n\n...but will become something like this.\n\n> Work must be alternate history. All works must be partially or entirely fictional with a basis in real-world history. However, fantasy and other paranormal or magical content is prohibited, except when part of a properly labelled ASB scenario.\n\nDepending on the popularity of this, they too might have the same rule as Future History, and be potentially set up for post on a specific day of the week; more discussion is necessary to get a feel in the sub for whether or not this is a change that you want, or if ASB scenarios should be part of regular posting. Note that this still means that they should be part of history - as in, you can't use the ASB flair to post your original fictional fantasy setting. It's historical with a spin.\n\nI think that covers just about everything, but if not, **post here and we'll see what else needs to be added to the list** - call these the topics for the upcoming Friday Forum if the above isn't a satisfactory set of answers to solve a matter, bricks in the road to a better /r/AlternateHistory. I'll be setting the system up for automatic megathread posting soon (assuming another mod doesn't beat me to it), I'm just a busy bee trying to rest my arm before carpal tunnel permanently ends my professional wall-of-text career before it begins.",

You know what happens when two people come to the party in the same outfit, or something; there's usually some drama and/or bitchy murder, I haven't watched enough movies so I don't know for sure. Whatever it is, we might as well get rid of one - I'm up for axing the new one, then going for a sort of split like this: \n\npre-1700s > 1700s to 1900s > post 1900s > Post 2000.\n\nThat seems fairly natural, though I might be up for adding a sort of classical era one at the start; it makes sense, after all. The 2100s category is likely to as well, as that's just stepping on the toes of future history for no real reason. Ye olde Althist Help is mostly a tag for support of the forum, so that's probably being retired, too, as part of this sub's slow work to becoming its own thing, but I'll keep it around for a couple of weeks and see if any usage cases come up that sits outside of the new and improved Meta post flair. \n\nMod Updates? That thing's gone. It was used ultra rarely, fell completely under the domain of meta, and was pretty easy to toss right now. If the team needs to talk to people on that base, that's what a sticky with the meta tag is for. \n\nIf you've got suggestions for link flairs, toss them here.",

            "I think A2 is by far the best option. It would make moderation simpler for the mods, it would keep the subreddit more focused on alternate history instead of politics. \n\nI think users should definitely be posting their own analysis of how they think the scenario would play out if they post a what if question. IDK which wording is best.\n\nI think future history should be restricted to a day or two per week. Looking at what posts get most upvoted, it is clear that future and modern day politics scenarios will dominate unless they are restricted to certain days.\n\nIMO the change to rule E is fine.\n\nLike with future history I believe that ASB should be restricted to a couple days of the week.",
            "For Rule 8, I'd specifically emphasize \"low-effort\" content, since that ties together the biggest criticisms of the what-ifs and shitposts, an directly list the alternate subreddits to post to instead.\n\n> No low-effort content, shitposts, and memes. This includes \"What if\" scenarios where the OP simply asks a question without offering at least a paragraph of their own ideas for how the scenario would play out. Please post standalone what-ifs to /r/historywhatif, and memes or shitposts to /r/alternatepisstory.\n\nAs for the ASB rule, I'd just rephrase it for clarity and offer an explanation of what ASB stands for: \n\n> Work must be alternate history. All works must be partially or entirely fictional with a basis in real-world history. Works where the divergence involves magic, sci-fi, the paranormal, the impossible, and other \"Alien Space Bats\"-type scenarios are permitted as long as they are properly tagged with the ASB flair.",

Just inject yourself with this virus and wait, it's way simpler than doctors cutting into you with surgical tools and (probably) less of a risk (assuming the virus is incapable of killing its hosts). Of course, the problem lies with people who don't want a sex change getting infected with this thing. Vaccines would definitely be developed, but maybe, just maybe, there's a possibility that someone already infected and gender swapped could be infected again and swapped back to the gender they were originally. Should that be possible, it'd be discovered, and the virus could basically be used as its own \"cure.\" Someone who didn't want to be gender swapped can just inject themselves with the virus again, change back to their original gender, and then take a vaccine to make sure they never get infected again. This thing definitely won't be eradicated, it'll be tamed and utilized as what's definitely the most efficient (but not totally painless) treatment for gender dysphoria.",
