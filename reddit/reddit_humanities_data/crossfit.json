        "content": "I have coached for 6+ years and have dealt with kids who don't stay in the designated area. Recently this has gotten significantly worse due to a change in the designated kids area and the fact that recently new owners do not feel it is that important (or dangerous). This happened today and the parent was literally right there and would not reprimand their child to stop. \n\nCoaches/owners-do you think this behavior should be addressed or do you feel it is acceptable? How would you suggest a coach approach the owner to convey their concerns?",

            "You are a coach. Show this picture to your owner via email, document your concerns clearly and concisely in terms of liability, BCC yourself and save the receipts. Once you have taken 10 to 15 minutes to do all that, repeat after me: This shit's above my paygrade.",
            "Legit wondering how they even got themselves in this position. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28",
            "I mean it\u2019s a fucking ridiculous thing for owners to allow. But as owners, it\u2019s ultimately their call. If they want to allow stuff like this, it\u2019s their right to do so as the business owner (at least until some kid gets hurts, sues the gym, and puts them out of business)\n\nAs either an employee or a member, there really isn\u2019t much you can do. Other than deciding this is the type of organization you don\u2019t want to be affiliated with, and find a new gym.",
            "I\u2019d bring it up directly with the owner and if they weren\u2019t willing to hear feedback, I\u2019d leave. That\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen. (And as a member, I HATE this. I\u2019ve left over unruly kids)",
            "I treat kids like kids, and adults like adults. If a kid wants to act like an adult, I\u2019ll treat them that way. If an adult wants to act like a kid, I\u2019ll respond accordingly. That\u2019s a kid that wants to be an adult. Coach them. Explain to them why it\u2019s dangerous and that\u2019s not what the rings are for. So it so the parent hears and sees this. Respond to the parent based on my first sentence.",
            "This is quite literally the only thing I don\u2019t like about my gym. The owner and coaches allow people to bring their kids and there is no designated kid area. The kids are running around while people are literally dropping barbells. I go about my workout as best I can but I will straight up tell a kid to move when I come back to my rower and a 5 year old is on it. I\u2019m probably going to talk to the owner soon. I\u2019m not there to babysit and if a kid walks in front of me when I\u2019m dropping a 30 pound ball\u2026 not my problem.",
            "I\u2019m an owner. We don\u2019t allow kids to be in the gym. Only the kids area.",
            "Ok, as a middle school teacher and coach who deals with shit like this sometimes (not allowed in my class or on my teams) I'm going to take a different angle...wtf is wrong with the parents letting their kid do this? Whether or not the owners allow it is a whole other story, but the parents?! You are literally begging for hospital bills, and not to mention the kid isn't just putting themselves in danger when they are goofing off in the workout area. All it takes is one wild kid to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and an athlete has to halt/adjust their movement in an awkward way, a piece of equipment comes down wrong, etc, and now the athlete gets hurt. Parents, BE BETTER!",
            "At this point those owners are literally waiting until a kid gets seriously injured or killed before enforcing rules.",

I just do some kind of activity everyday. Activities are rucking, biking, kettlebell workouts, and bodyweight workouts. I injured myself recently prepping for a powerlifting meet, so I can\u2019t touch a barbell right now. And, I\u2019m somewhat limited in what I can do without a barbell. So, my options are limited. \n\nAnyway, my simple question is, are the WOD\u2019s on the CrossFit site intended to be a full workout? They seem pretty short, in most cases. I feel like it\u2019s just a small part of a larger full training day. But, just wondering. \n",

            "Warm up plus hitting that piece at full intensity is the goal. CrossFit believes that intensity > volume in terms of body\u2019s response. \n\nThink of this as a 5k run. You can do it at 80% and do extra stuff that day. Or you hit that 5k at 100% max intensity and you won\u2019t want to do anything else that day.",
            "Some are intentionally short because the intent is to hit a certain stimulus and energy system (higher glycolytic or ATP opposed to just oxidative). \u201cShorter\u201d though will sometimes involve having a much more thorough or longer warm up process in order to properly prepare to go full out on those WODs (or strength sets). In a coached class, a shorter workout means longer opportunity to practice technique and technique variations with people, and to have a warm up round or two. Example if it\u2019s 9-7-5 snatches and ring muscle ups, spend a considerable amount of time warming up the snatch and perhaps even slightly higher than workout weight before dropping. Practice muscle up transitions (or kipping drills).",
            "Ok. This makes a lot more sense. Thank you.",
            "Generally the layout of a CrossFit program will have some skill and strength work followed by a WOD, the workout doesn't always have to compliment the previous skill/strength work.\n\nMainsite will just show a WOD.\n\nIf you do the WOD and scale appropriately where needed, you won't be fit to do much more after it.\n\nThere's a variety of programs you can follow if you aren't at a CrossFit gym.",
            "No, the WOD is just part of what is normally an hour-long class. Normally, I would say a class is broken down like this:\n\n1) Warmups: Usually the first thing is something to get your heart rate up a bit. This could be a three-minute row, 400m run, something like that. After that we might do mobility exercises with bands (if we're doing something like snatches or overhead squats), rope work, bear crawls, shuttle runs and other things like that. There is usually something that shows up commonly in workouts, like mini-metcons maybe involving box jumps, kettlebell swings, burpees, and stuff like that. While this is all over the place, it is usually 15-20 minutes of stretching, cardio, and some strength to warm up. Sometimes there are five minute EMOMs, sometimes multiple rounds of certain exercises, tabata bike or row work, you name it.\n\n2) Strength: Lots of different things to do here. Bench, deadlift, squat, front squat, overhead squat, C&J, snatch, you name it. We might be doing 5x3, maybe complexes on the Olympic lifts, maybe pause. Rep schemes and weights are varied but normally some of the components in the warmup are somewhat related to the strength workout. This might take 15-20 minutes.\n\n3) The actual workout is usually a metcon of some sort, like what you see on the CrossFit site. Sometimes these are all-out sprints (single digit minutes), sometimes rounds for time, sometimes AMRAP, you know the types. This usually takes us to the hour mark and we're done.\n\nIt's rare but if we only end up with 45 minutes of programmed work there will be accessory work at the end (mobility and stretching again or some resistance work).\n\nSo the WOD is just part of the overall workout.",
            "I run those workouts as the workouts at both of my affiliates. Yes, that's all the workout is. The rest of the time is spent on a proper warm-up and cool down. Ven .ore important is the practice before the workout. 10-30-minutes before the workout is spent on skills, drills, and progressions. Some days are long, some days are very fast. It's well balanced and everyone has been getting results for years. \n\nOf course with coaching and scaling it doesn't matter the programming, but dotcom is unbiased in that you won't go through specific cycles or avoid exercises. Weakness training comes through the warm-up, skill work, and scaling workouts properly. \n\nCycles work, but results tend to not stick, and if you avoid things and cherry pick you miss out on a ton of fitness. CrossFit is balanced, short to long, light to heavy, low rep to high rep, lots of rest to no rest. Programs that do it different, like you said, aren't CrossFit.",
            "Got it. Thanks all.",
            "The shorter the workout, the longer the warm-up. \n\nA warm-up should start with general movement to assess how you are feeling and ensure the parts of you that need to move are able to move. \n\nA specific warm-up that helps you develop the skills you need for the met-con while also dialing in your scales for the met-con. \n\nIf the workout was something quick, like 5 rounds of 10 Snatches 65/95 and 15 Bar-Facing Burpee, my start my plan for the day would look something like this:\n\n3 Rounds of\n\n* 45s of Burpees, increasing pace every round\n* 45s of Pass through into tall muscle-snatch\n\nThen some snatch related drills before going for 4 or 5 sets of 10 snatches. I would ideally work up a little heavier then the met-con weight, but I wouldn't try to PR. Maybe 65, 95, 135, 155 or something similar. \n\nThen I would perform something like 5 Snatch, 10 Bar-Facing Burpee, 5 Snatch to make sure everything was dialed in before taking a shit then starting the workout in earnest. \n\nFollowing the workout, I would do something like Snatch Grip deadlifts, either as a cool down if I felt done for the day, or going a little heavier as some supplemental strength if I wanted to really get after it. \n\n[THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqhzkQdvS9A) is what the above would look like in a class environment."
