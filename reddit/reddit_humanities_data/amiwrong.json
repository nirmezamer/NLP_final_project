        "content": "My partner is a veteran with PTSD, anxiety, and a few other mental health issues. The VA recommended we do couples counseling, and today was our second session. The therapist said something today I really don't agree with, but I want to know if I am in the wrong for feeling this way. \n\nBecause of my partner's mental health issues, he can be very selfish and not consider my needs sometimes. I have been hoping that therapy would help him with that, and understand my point of view better. \n\nAn issue that has been causing the most arguments lately is that he doesn't help me clean. I have to nag him, and sometimes that doesn't even work. We both work full-time. His job is just very physical and busy in the summer, and he sometimes works 14-hour days. This is just in the summer; he doesn't work much in the winter. \n\nI work from home, but I am also a full time college student. I still make time with the little time I have to clean the house. \n\nWhen I ask him to help, I only ask for small things to help me out. I will clean the entire house and only ask that he wash the dishes in the sink and take the trash out. I don't demand these get done the second I ask about it or even the day I ask about it. Once five days have passed, and the trash is still sitting there, I get angry. \n\nI brought this up in therapy today and mentioned that it also bugs me because I go out of my way to do things for him, but he doesn't consider me. \n\nHe knows I have trauma from growing up in a hoarder house, and he doesn't care to think about me. \n\nThe therapist said that my \"need\" for the house to be clean is my problem because of my trauma and that I need to compromise with my partner. He said that my partner doesn't choose to work, but I chose to take these summer classes, so my stress is my own fault. \n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way because I don't feel I am asking for a lot. \n\nI get that taking summer classes was my choice, but I graduate in December, and I can help our family financially when I get this degree. The therapist said I need to compromise, but what about my partner? How is it unfair for me to ask for help? Why do I need to compromise when I have been sobbing to my partner, telling him I feel like I'm drowning?\n\nI really want to improve the relationship, and I know that I am not a perfect partner. There are things I do that are wrong, but I don't feel like I am wrong in this situation.  \n\nI liked the therapist up until this point, but now I feel a little nervous. I also wanted to know if I mistook what he said. ",

            "Where's the compromise? You stop asking him repeatedly to clean the house and he will...?",
            "You both live in the house you both need to keep it clean",
            "Not wrong. That therapist is way out of line. And your partner does choose to work. And he chose his profession so its not your fault he works 14 hour days. Getting a degree to further your career so you make more money isnt less work than what your husband doesits just different. You arent asking for a lot and plenty of men are more busy and do way more at home. Im worried that now the therapist has encouraged your husbands behavior. Asking to take out the trash and do dishes while you clean the entire rest of the house and work and go to school is not unreasonable.",
            "Not wrong.. get a new therapist. Asking the adult you live with to do the dishes and take out the trash is not an unreasonable request. It's kinda of ridiculous, actually.. His issues/trauma has nothing to do with trash or dishes, unlike yours. He has no consideration for your feelings/mental health, yet you are supposed to cater to his? I think you're getting the short end of the stick here, my dear. You need to ask yourself if you really want this to be your life? Personally, I would throw out the whole damn man. I don't need any more children to take care of, nor do I care to be with someone who obviously really gives no fs about me..",
            "Everyone living in a house needs to help keep it clean.\nThat therapist isn't very good.\nYou're already compromising by doing the bulk of the house work.",
            "NTA, stop cleaning up after him and for us on yourself, see how long it takes before that becomes a problem for him and then he realises the therapist is wrong and its not your need for cleanliness its the reality that if it doesnt get done the house is a mess.",
            "You two should be splitting anything that you would have to do if the other wasn't there. If you weren't there, he'd have to do it ALL by himself.",
            "There is really no point with a therapist like this. It is already decided! You are just being instructed. It's more of a teacher or boss than a therapist. Marriage is about compromise. And by definition, that comes from both sides. Why only you? Ask that question of your therapist. Make sure it's in the form of a question. Make everything a question. Make them answer. You're paying them. You may want to switch therapists. Especially if you don't get good answers to your questions.",
            "Sounds like the same garbage that was foisted on me while I was still married to my ex.   He worked 6am to 3pm as a postal worker.  He got home and vanished into his man cave.  He never helped with kids or cleaning. But expected me to do it all. I, too, worked outside the home. And came home to cook dinner, clean up, and get the kids to bed. He never emerged from the mancave, unless it was to eat or go to bed.  After I finished cleaning up , I had to prep the meal for the next day..  when we got together with our friends, he complained about how  the house was.  So \"we\" all decided that if I were better at cleaning, he would spend less time in his mancave on his computer. So basically, I had to do even more, and he got approval to ignore us all., I was done.  He became more violent, I filed for divorce.   \n\nNo, op, you are absolutely not wrong . For disagreeing with a terrible counselor.  Time to be done.  Let him have his own place."

Me, my partner and this friend went out for drinks around 2 months ago. The friend was quite shy and socially awkward.\n\nShe thanked me for being nice to her and understanding she wasn't extroverted etc and takes a while to be comfortable around people. I told her not to worry and that I'm not going to judge her for being shy when I used to be really shy when I wsa younger. As the night went on things were going well until one point when my gf went to the toilet at one of the bars.\n\nThe friend got closer to me and tried to kiss me. I backed off before she managed to get close enough and told my gf straight away. Me and my gf left the bar and went home. For a couple of weeks they didn't speak but my gf decided to hear her out and went to meet up with her.\n\nThey talked things through and this friend apologised to my gf and told her to apologise to me aswell. My gf said they're working on mending their friendship and have been meeting up again.\n\n A couple of weeks ago my girlfriend said she was thinking of the three of us going for drinks again but I refused. I said I think it's odd she's still friends with her but I can't control her friend but what I can control is who I'm around and I don't want to be around her. \n\nMy girlfriend said I was overreacting and the friend is sorry. Last week my gf mentioned doing a movie night with this friend and asked if I would be home. I told her I was and that I don't want the friend in the apartment.\n\n My gf said I could always go out for the evening but I refused and just said if she wants a movie night she can go to her friends because I don't want her friend in our apartment.
