        "content": "I (M26) and four years ago, everything changed for me. My childhood best friend,(F25), was in a really tough spot. She was pregnant, the father left her, and she had nowhere to go. We've been close since we were kids, and I couldn't just watch her struggle, so I took her in.\n\nAt first, it was supposed to be temporary, but over time, we got really close. I helped her through her pregnancy, was there when her daughter was born, and eventually, we fell in love. Now, they feel like my family, and I love them both very much. Her daughter even calls me \"daddy,\" which means the world to me.\n\nA few months ago, I started thinking about proposing to her. It might not be the usual way things happen, but I'm sure about my feelings and want to make our family official. When I told my parents, they weren't happy. They think I should focus on starting my own family from scratch and that my best friend and her daughter aren't part of that plan. They say I'm giving up my future for something that's not my responsibility.\n\nI've tried to explain that they are my family now and I love them deeply, but my parents are convinced I'm making a mistake. They say I'm too young to take on such a big commitment and should be with someone who doesn't have \"baggage.\"\n\nThis whole thing has caused a big fight between us. I do care about my parents' opinions, but I can't imagine my life without my best friend and her daughter. They've brought so much joy and purpose to my life, and I want to be there for them as a husband and father. I don\u2019t feel bad about this decision at all.\n\n",

Someone who came with baggage and why would he want to raise someone else's kids (never mind that she had married her 2nd husband when my dad was a kid still, so technically she had baggage too? She has never made sense) was all his mom could ask. \n\nHe told her that he chose to be my dad, no one was forcing him to be my dad, it was what he to be. He has always loved me and treated me as his daughter, just like he has with my younger sister. \n\nHe told her to stop with her bullshit (only nicer than that) and that if she had a problem with it, then it was just that, her problem. \n\nYou get to choose who you love and marry.

Talk to her and find out what she wants out of your relationship, whether it's romantic, or platonic. From what you've said here, there's no sign of a  two-sided romantic relationship. If you propose to her without you both being on the same page, you could end up losing them in your life by blindsiding a proposal she isn't at all expecting.",

Don\u2019t engage. Don\u2019t discuss, just excuse yourself and leave. They will catch on eventually and you get a less stressful environment either way. Win for you, loss for them until they smarten up."

She had him when she was young, and the father isn't involved at all. She told me she has a solid support system and manages everything well, but honestly, I was caught off guard. I hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility that she might be a mom.\n\nI took a few days to think it over and realized that I\u2019m just not ready for that kind of responsibility. It's not that I have anything against her or her son\u2014it's just that I\u2019m still figuring out my own life. I knew I had to be honest with her, so we met up for coffee.\n\nI told her, as gently as I could, that while I think she's amazing, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to be involved with someone who has a child. I explained that it's more about where I am in my own life and less about her or her son. She seemed to understand, but I could tell she was hurt and disappointed.\n\nLater, our mutual friend told me that Sarah felt really judged and hurt by my decision. She said it was unfair to dismiss her just because she's a single mom and that I should have given it more of a chance.\n\nNow I\u2019m feeling really conflicted. On one hand, I believe it\u2019s better to be upfront about my feelings rather than leading her on.

Who the fuck gifts a loaf of fucken bread to someone for their birthday?! \n\nThe thing is I don't care for bread, have never mentioned bread before in conversation or made the stuff. I buy my fucken bread from the shop and put it in the freezer and use it when I feel like it (which isn't often). \n\nThey were even talking about it with other guests saying, when you don't know what to get someone get them consumables- like it was the best gift idea ever... It is fucken bread! \n\nAIW for being annoyed, miffed and just pissed off these people got me a loaf of fucken bread that cost no more than $20 as a gift between 3 of them when my partner and I shelled out $60 to feed all 3 of them last night to celebrate my birthday?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI am Australian \n\nThe \"gift expectation\":\nPpl seem to think I was expecting gifts from everyone. That is not true, there was several who didn't get me a gift and I don't care. As I have said numerous times I would have preferred nothing. I am upset because this gift is so left field of me it has me questioning myself and their motives. \n\nIf anyone is curious out of the 6 people who came I got 2 gifts; the bread and a gift voucher from someone else. \n\nThe 3 people:\nThe three people are fine financially. Two are a retired couple and one is a single woman. And yes they were told on the invitation that food was covered just buy your own drinks.\n\nWhy I don't like the gift:\nI don't appreciate bread at all it is just a good item I will eat if it is there, but I don't care for it or its fancy versions. I also don't like honey that much that I would use it at home. I will have it when I go out and that is it. The honey was local raw honey. \n\nThe place we are at being \"cheap\":\nIt was an all you can eat Mongolian BBQ restaurant, it is \"cheap\" because all you have to choose from is frozen meat brisket, sliced vegetables and 6 sauces. It wasn't buffet food with oodles of options. It is just a meat/veg option to be bbq by the staff for you. We choose this food options because people can have as much or as little and what they wanted and leave feeling satisfied.\n\nThe tldr truma around my birthday:\nNarc parent shit birthdays my whole life, these ppl know birthdays are an interesting time for me.\n\nWhy we paid for people's meals:\nMy partner and I recently moved to the city and before we moved I lived in a country town that is 35 minutes from the city. And all but 1 of the guests we invited live in the country town, they were driving down to see me I wanted to make it worth their while. Not that it matters but the 1 person who lives in the city we picked them up and dropped them off home. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nI was given the bread because one of the 3 people have it all the time at a cafe with eggs on it. They have never brought it themselves. They did ask if I tired the honey and I said honestly honey isn't my thing and they just told me to put it in cakes or tea (I never drink tea). ",
