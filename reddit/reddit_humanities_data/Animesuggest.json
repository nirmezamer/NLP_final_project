        "content": "&#x200B;\n\n# What is this subreddit for?\n\nThis subreddit is intended for users to request and suggest anime/manga/light-novels and visual novels to others.\n\n# Flairs\n\n* **What to Watch?** \u2014 For asking for recommendations about what anime to watch.\n* **Watch This!** \\[at least 1500 characters\\] \u2014 Long-form writings which encourage readers to watch a certain anime by analyzing its strengths and weaknesses.\n* **Manga/LN/VN** \u2014 For asking for recommendations about what manga/LN/VN to read.\n* **What's this From? (unsolved)** \u2014 For asking questions about the source of a specific anime scene, image, or reference that remains unsolved.\n* **What's this From (solved)** \u2014 For when your question about identifying the source of a specific anime scene, image, or reference has been answered.\n* **Series Specific Question** \u2014 For specific questions about an anime series, its plot, characters, or any related details.\n* **Meta** \u2014 For subreddit related matters. Should this post be about the subreddit, please contact the moderators via modmail to approve it accordingly.\n\n# Do Not Post Untagged Spoilers\n\nThis rule is very important, and it is suggested that you read through this section carefully. Posting untagged spoilers is a quick way to get banned.\n\n# What is a spoiler?\n\nA spoiler is a piece of information from a show that knowledge of without having seen the show could negatively impact a viewer's experience. An easy example is knowing the twist of a movie prior to watching it. By having knowledge of said twist, all the surprise and suspense will be lost because you already know what happens. Note that this is a very broad and obvious example, and we limit more than this.\n\n**Generally speaking, anything you don't learn in the first few minutes of the first episode should have a spoiler tag.**\n\n* All spoilers must be tagged\n* No spoilers in the title\n* If the title of a post says it contains spoilers from a specific show, no spoilers in that post or its comments need be tagged, except when they're about events happening after a specified episode given by the OP (e.g. episode 100 spoilers have to be tagged when the thread says it's about episode 50).\n\n# How to tag spoilers\n\n* If you're using mobile Reddit, old Reddit, or Markdown Mode use this format: `>!Spoiler text!<` . It will look like this  >!Spoiler text!< .\n* If you're using desktop Reddit, simply highlight the text you want marked as a spoiler and click the exclamation mark-shaped spoiler button to mark the selected text as a spoiler.\n\n# Please check the anime recommendations list below first.\n\n# [Anime Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations/)",
