        "content": "Hello everyone! Been a while since the last mod post.\n\nWe have updated the rules to be more concise; there is now only 5 rules instead of 7. As well, rule 2 regarding deal guidelines now outlines how to review a deal prior to posting to make that info more readily available to users. Everything else should be roughly the same; these changes should be reflected on both new and old Reddit. If you notice any typos or ambiguity in the updated rules or just have suggestions to improve the sub, please leave a comment on this post or [contact the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/buildapcsales).\n\nAs well, we are currently requiring mod approval for all posts of Sapphire and XFX GPUs as a result of an increase in fraudulent listings being posted. Reminder that every post in violation will lead to a **24 hour ban.** Please read the rules prior to posting to avoid posting fraudulent listings. We will remove this requirement when possible.\n\nLastly, we have recently banned posts of DeepCool products. The company has [been sanctioned by the U.S. government](https://www.state.gov/taking-additional-measures-to-degrade-russias-wartime-economy/#:~:text=BEIJING%20DEEPCOOL%20INDUSTRIES%20CO%20LTD) and their products have been delisted from Amazon and Newegg. As well, the comments on these posts strayed away from relevant discussion towards politics irrelevant to the sub. This may be changed in the future if needed. \n\nAnother reminder that [OS deals are banned from the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1aegupz/ban_on_future_os_deals/) and that [post flairs have been updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1af5mo7/post_flairs_update_scam_listings_enforcement/). We are aware of issues relating to the sidebar flair menu; for now we recommend using \"flair:\" in the search bar for the same functionality (e.g. flair:GPU to show all GPU posts).",

            "Thanks for being proactive and keeping the sub safe and clean.\n\nif only Amazon could do the bare minimum to stop fraudulent sellers though.",
            "Totally missed the DeepCool stuff. That's wild.",
            "I was really hoping we'd see more DeepCool stuff get hit with steep discounts before they got pulled, but with their products being delisted on most retailers already it doesn't seem likely, and given how the conversations tended to devolve I understand the rule being put in place. \n\nI'm just curious what even happens to all that product in this sort of situation though? Are they really just trashing all of that inventory? Or should we be expecting some of it to turn up in liquidation sales in the near future?",
            "why specifically Sapphire/XFX GPUs? nothing stops scammers from making these listings under any particular brand or component.\n\nI think an overall ban on posting ANY deal from a non-reputable Amazon/Newegg/eBay seller would be a better solution",
            "I know users often crap all over mods, but this subs' mod team does a great job. Thank you all!",
            "> we are currently requiring mod approval for all posts of Sapphire and XFX GPUs as a result of an increase in fraudulent listings being posted\n\nDoes this mean a post containing those keywords just needs mod approval before showing, or do you require the poster to contact mods via modmail before posting?",
            "\"Politics are not allowed. Anyway, we've decided more politics needed to be added\"",
            "Sounds good. Can we also get rid of the \"in store only\" posts that exist only to advertise one specific chain every time? There are not that many of those stores, and I'm sure there's a huge amount of us who are nowhere near one.",
            "I wish the ban would be 48-72hrs! Really let the people know not mess with one of the best deals locations ever since ever! Clicking on a badly posted post, feel like Youtube clickbait",
            "lmao why would it matter on DeepCool Products as long as there any  decent deal with retailers trying to offload it for cheap"

Not sure if it's the chip, firmware, or a combination of. When I turn the TV on, I have to disable and re-enable the wifi (in the TV). Every. Single. Time. Probably going to end up running an ethernet cable, which is the better option anyways.",

            "it's just your tv. i have 2 for almost a year and no wifi problems. got mine from costco tho",
            "I use ethernet to my a2. It's they only way to play large bitrate movies/tv show files without buffering. Unfortunately the ethernet isn't great by todays standards either but it works.\n\nedit: When i did use wifi for a bit, I put another wifi router next to the tv and ran an ethernet cable from it to the tv and put the router into bridge or satellite mode and it was pretty damn good."

YMMV on how much it bothers you.\n\nMy neighbor has both the mini-led and oled models and I personally prefer the mini-led model for all around use (due to less text fringe) but would prefer the oled if it was for mostly for gaming for less bloom/better colors/pixel response/etc."

            "That's the right way to go.  The reason this is cheap and has a bundled ram is because your idea is what everyone wants to do and these non X3D chips are not moving off the shelves.  These chips are pretty much hitting near rock bottom.  You can't really go wrong either way though and what you pay for is what you get at the value that these chips are being offered for.
