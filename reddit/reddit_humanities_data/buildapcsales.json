        "content": "Hello again! Apologies for the influx of mod posts recently - we have been making changes to improve the user experience.\n\nThe sub's post flairs have been overhauled today. The list of changes is as follows:\n\n* Headset, HTPC, Miscellaneous, Mouse Pad, Optical Drive, OS, Printer, and Router have been removed due to infrequent use and/or redundancy\n* Flash Drive has been renamed to External Storage to be more broad; this includes external HDDs and SSDs, flash drives, SD / microSD cards, drive enclosures including NAS, etc.\n* Mic has been renamed to Microphone\n* TV has been added separate from Monitor due to high post volume\n\nIf you have any further suggestions for changes to the flair system, feel free to leave a comment on this thread or [send us modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/buildapcsales). \n\nThese changes do affect Reddit's search functionality; any previous posts with the old flairs can still be searched by name. They should be reflected accurately in Discord; if you notice any issues, please let us know.\n\nIn addition, as a result of continued posting of scam listings following [last week's stickied mod post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/19cohqf/scam_listings_title_formatting/), we are now enforcing this rule with **24 hour bans** for every post in violation. Please refer to the linked post or the stickied comment on marketplace posts on how to determine if a listing on these websites is legitimate or not.",

            "Will the `old.reddit` sidebar be updated with search links for new flairs?",
            "There should be an infraction counter for posting those scam links if such a thing is possible with increasing penalties. This is just my humble opinion, but perhaps it should be a 24-hour ban, 1-week ban (2nd offense), and on as the person posts more malicious links. There are too many people here that have fallen for those scams.",
            "Glad to see no more OS sales. The rules for only mod-approved commenting on OS posts got me scammed out of $40 on Woot, and presumably plenty more people, too. I wasn't even able to get a refund on mine after the key didn't work - they just delayed long enough until I found another way to get a key, and then sent a \"replacement\" key I didn't need and couldn't even try.\n\nMost people see $40 for a Windows key from a site they otherwise trust and flock to upvote it. An actual, fully legit key for that price **would** be a great deal, but you don't find out how scammy it is until they send you a \"tracking number\" that's supposed to be input as your Windows key. Comments were flooded with warnings nobody could see because they required mod approval and each time, it took mods many hours to get around to it. I personally saw that whole thing happen twice, and of course, on the second instance when I knew to warn others, my warning took mods too long to approve so it didn't help.",
            "Is this it Chief?\n\nIn for 4",
            "So does that mean we can no longer post any headset, htpc, miscellaneous, mouse pads, optical drives OS, or printer nor router sales?",
            ">TV has been added separate from Monitor due to high post volume\n\nThank god, TVs are not monitors. Never have been.",
            ">Flash Drive has been renamed to External Storage to be more broad; this includes **external HDDs** and SSDs, flash drives, SD / microSD cards, **drive enclosures including NAS**, etc.\n\nSo is \"HDD\" only for *internal*, no-shuck-needed mechanical HDDs?\n\nIt seems to me that people looking for a spinner would likely want to see all the spinners, internal or otherwise.\n\nAlso, people looking for a portable storage device, flash or otherwise, would probably *not* want to see 3.5\" external HDDs that require a power brick plugged into a wall outlet.\n\nAnd a NAS is an entire computer.",
            "Have flairs disappeared altogether now?  I used to see it on the right navigation pane, but now I can't see them at all.",
            "Can we get a quick rundown on the nonsense that happened with win11 and woot? I\u2019m just stunned that woot \u2014 an Amazon outlet and heretofore reputable company \u2014 was selling bogus keys.",

I\u2019ve bought one of these and two 6900 XTs from them before, things to note:\n\n- Typically comes in a white unmarked box with anti-static wrap and good foam.\n\n- Some models come with cosmetic blemishes, though most of mine have been flawless. Some have even come with plastic still on the fans and logos.\n\n- ASRock USA does NOT offer a warranty on these items beyond the 30 day return (confirmed by phone and text chat with ASRock USA). Treat this like any other used purchase, albeit from a reputable source.\n\nI\u2019ve had great experience with this card. Probably the cheapest way to get 16GB of VRAM. Good luck!",
