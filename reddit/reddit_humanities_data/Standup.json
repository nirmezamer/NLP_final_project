        "content": "Welcome to /r/standup, reddit's home for discussing the art of standup comedy. Here are a few things you should read before you interact with the community:\n\nNote: Please follow the video posting guidelines, and do not try to use this sub to promote individual shows, or your posts will be removed. Also, don't post your podcast here unless the individual episode you're posting has something to do with performing standup. (Just having a comedian on as a guest or being hosted by a comedian isn't enough. If it's not discussing some element of the craft of standup, this isn't the place for it.) And keep your podcast posts to no more than one a week, this isn't a podcast sub.\n\n**Are you looking to start doing standup?**\n\nGreat! We have some resources you can check out:\n\n* [/r/standup's How to start in standup comedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/wiki/index)\n* [John Roy's Free on-line standup comedy course](http://johnroycomic.tumblr.com/post/54132250195/my-complete-entirely-free-on-line-comedy-class)\n* [Ari Shaffir's advice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k43XcdlO22s)\n* [Ralphie May's advice video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uBB8HncsrU)\n* [Stewart Lee - On Not Writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrXVaytvJtQ)\n* [Steve Hofstetter's Comedy Pro-Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/search?q=author%3Athehofstetter+tip&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\n\n\n**Are you looking for places to perform?**\n\nHere are some resources that should help you find some stage time:\n\n* [Badslava.com \\(a large directory of open mics around the world\\)](http://www.badslava.com/)\n* [/r/standup's local group list \\(Regional Facebook Groups and websites\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/wiki/local_groups)\n\n\n\n**Are you posting a video asking for feedback on your act?**\n\n* Is it video of one of your first few times on stage? You probably don't really want to post that. You should do standup a few dozen times first, then post a video.\n* ~~Is it shot vertically instead of horizontally? You probably don't really want to post that. You know that makes the video nearly impossible to see on mobile devices and wastes tons of screen space on computers, right? You should make another video where you shoot it horizontally and post that instead.~~ I blame TikTok for ruining this one.\n* Is it hard to hear the sound or make out what you're saying? You probably don't really want to post that. If it's difficult to hear you, how is anyone going to give you any feedback on what you say? You should either fix the audio problem on the video, or just shoot another where the audio is decent, then post a video.\n* Is it just video of you in a room somewhere not in front of an audience? You definitely don't want to post that. It's not standup comedy, so you might want to try another sub for that. Or just go get on stage (at least a few dozen times), then shoot video of you on stage in front of an audience and post that video instead.\n\n\n**Are you posting a video of a comedian because you want fans of comedy to see it?**\n\nCool, we all like comedy- but if you're doing that, you should probably also post a comment about why you want to discuss this particular set. If you don't have a reason to discuss it, it might be better to just post it in /r/standupcomedy instead (that's the sub for fans of comedy to share video of their favorite comedians). Also, please make sure that it's not a pirated video, or we'll have to remove it. Most comedians don't make very much money, so please don't take away one of the few revenue generators they have.\n\n\n**If you still want to post a video, here are our rules:**\n\n\nIt must have a descriptive title telling us why you are posting it. If you're sharing a video, it should be to generate some kind of discussion. Video of your own act is totally fine, but please own that it's yours (in the first person) and give us something to talk about. Video of famous comedians is fine, if you're sharing it to make a point and your title reflects that. If you post videos repeatedly that are just to try to get attention and not discuss the craft of standup, we'll remove them and eventually ban you from the sub.\n\n\nGOOD VIDEO TITLES:\n\n* Is this set too blue to submit to festivals?\n\n* I got heckled last night, could I have handled this better?\n\n* Doug Stanhope's bit about his mother shows how to make a dark and difficult subject completely hilarious.\n\n\nBAD VIDEO TITLES:\n\n* My Name - My Joke Title\n\n* Bo Burnham - Can't Handle This (Kanye Rant) - MAKE HAPPY Netflix [HD]\n\n* HECKLER OWNED\n\nIf you ignore this request, we'll remove your video and not even bother telling you why, because clearly you didn't even read this.\n\n\n\n**Are you posting about a show you're doing?**\n\nDon't. Just...don't. We're comedians- we're not going to pay to see your show. Also, your show is in a place where almost all of us aren't. We're all over the globe on this sub, so even if your show is in LA, NYC, Toronto, London, etc. the vast majority of us aren't there. If you ignore this and post it anyway, it will be removed.\n\n**Want to chat about standup?**\n\nCheck out the [r/standup chatroom here](https://s.reddit.com/channel/371709_abff0a88d59d785c7d946801922c1e0617e401dc).\n\nYou can also visit a number of standup related Discord servers. Please note, none of these are affiliated with this sub in any way, we're just linking to them in case you want to check them out.\n\n[Stand up comedy](https://discord.gg/AmvDg8h)\n\n[Stand-Up Comedy](https://discord.gg/GVjb72Z)\n\n[Stand up Comedy](https://discord.gg/8GZf38s)\n\n[Comedy Collective](https://discord.gg/t5fGmhK)\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and welcome to the community!",

I'd like to get some feedback on a bit that I'm working on but I don't know who I can trust to run it by besides other comics. Is this somewhere I can post a bit and get feedback on it? I want to make sure that my material is stage worthy. I get that you're only really going to know if it kills or not by trying it but I think it's safer to make sure that it makes sense and has potential; I also don't want to try something new and find out that something similar has been done and I end up coming off hackish.",

If youre not well prepared, the show might go well if youre lucky.
