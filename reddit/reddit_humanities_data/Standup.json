        "content": "Welcome to /r/standup, reddit's home for discussing the art of standup comedy. Here are a few things you should read before you interact with the community:\n\nNote: Please follow the video posting guidelines, and do not try to use this sub to promote individual shows, or your posts will be removed. Also, don't post your podcast here unless the individual episode you're posting has something to do with performing standup. (Just having a comedian on as a guest or being hosted by a comedian isn't enough. If it's not discussing some element of the craft of standup, this isn't the place for it.) And keep your podcast posts to no more than one a week, this isn't a podcast sub.\n\n**Are you looking to start doing standup?**\n\nGreat! We have some resources you can check out:\n\n* [/r/standup's How to start in standup comedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/wiki/index)\n* [John Roy's Free on-line standup comedy course](http://johnroycomic.tumblr.com/post/54132250195/my-complete-entirely-free-on-line-comedy-class)\n* [Ari Shaffir's advice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k43XcdlO22s)\n* [Ralphie May's advice video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uBB8HncsrU)\n* [Stewart Lee - On Not Writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrXVaytvJtQ)\n* [Steve Hofstetter's Comedy Pro-Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/search?q=author%3Athehofstetter+tip&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\n\n\n**Are you looking for places to perform?**\n\nHere are some resources that should help you find some stage time:\n\n* [Badslava.com \\(a large directory of open mics around the world\\)](http://www.badslava.com/)\n* [/r/standup's local group list \\(Regional Facebook Groups and websites\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/wiki/local_groups)\n\n\n\n**Are you posting a video asking for feedback on your act?**\n\n* Is it video of one of your first few times on stage? You probably don't really want to post that. You should do standup a few dozen times first, then post a video.\n* ~~Is it shot vertically instead of horizontally? You probably don't really want to post that. You know that makes the video nearly impossible to see on mobile devices and wastes tons of screen space on computers, right? You should make another video where you shoot it horizontally and post that instead.~~ I blame TikTok for ruining this one.\n* Is it hard to hear the sound or make out what you're saying? You probably don't really want to post that. If it's difficult to hear you, how is anyone going to give you any feedback on what you say? You should either fix the audio problem on the video, or just shoot another where the audio is decent, then post a video.\n* Is it just video of you in a room somewhere not in front of an audience? You definitely don't want to post that. It's not standup comedy, so you might want to try another sub for that. Or just go get on stage (at least a few dozen times), then shoot video of you on stage in front of an audience and post that video instead.\n\n\n**Are you posting a video of a comedian because you want fans of comedy to see it?**\n\nCool, we all like comedy- but if you're doing that, you should probably also post a comment about why you want to discuss this particular set. If you don't have a reason to discuss it, it might be better to just post it in /r/standupcomedy instead (that's the sub for fans of comedy to share video of their favorite comedians). Also, please make sure that it's not a pirated video, or we'll have to remove it. Most comedians don't make very much money, so please don't take away one of the few revenue generators they have.\n\n\n**If you still want to post a video, here are our rules:**\n\n\nIt must have a descriptive title telling us why you are posting it. If you're sharing a video, it should be to generate some kind of discussion. Video of your own act is totally fine, but please own that it's yours (in the first person) and give us something to talk about. Video of famous comedians is fine, if you're sharing it to make a point and your title reflects that. If you post videos repeatedly that are just to try to get attention and not discuss the craft of standup, we'll remove them and eventually ban you from the sub.\n\n\nGOOD VIDEO TITLES:\n\n* Is this set too blue to submit to festivals?\n\n* I got heckled last night, could I have handled this better?\n\n* Doug Stanhope's bit about his mother shows how to make a dark and difficult subject completely hilarious.\n\n\nBAD VIDEO TITLES:\n\n* My Name - My Joke Title\n\n* Bo Burnham - Can't Handle This (Kanye Rant) - MAKE HAPPY Netflix [HD]\n\n* HECKLER OWNED\n\nIf you ignore this request, we'll remove your video and not even bother telling you why, because clearly you didn't even read this.\n\n\n\n**Are you posting about a show you're doing?**\n\nDon't. Just...don't. We're comedians- we're not going to pay to see your show. Also, your show is in a place where almost all of us aren't. We're all over the globe on this sub, so even if your show is in LA, NYC, Toronto, London, etc. the vast majority of us aren't there. If you ignore this and post it anyway, it will be removed.\n\n**Want to chat about standup?**\n\nCheck out the [r/standup chatroom here](https://s.reddit.com/channel/371709_abff0a88d59d785c7d946801922c1e0617e401dc).\n\nYou can also visit a number of standup related Discord servers. Please note, none of these are affiliated with this sub in any way, we're just linking to them in case you want to check them out.\n\n[Stand up comedy](https://discord.gg/AmvDg8h)\n\n[Stand-Up Comedy](https://discord.gg/GVjb72Z)\n\n[Stand up Comedy](https://discord.gg/8GZf38s)\n\n[Comedy Collective](https://discord.gg/t5fGmhK)\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and welcome to the community!",

Not to sound dramatic but I\u2019ve always felt destined for a career in comedy, never had original ideas or any stand up ideas at the time\u2026 now, I\u2019m more confident in my writing than ever, and I can happily say that comedy is saving my life.

            "He meant that he has decided the show will go well regardless of the quality of the crowd. So it it's a good crowd it will go great, and if it's a bad crowd he will up his energy, \"lean in\" to bits, go into crowd work, switch out new material with old standards, heighten emphasis on lines, etc... to get them there. but regardless, he will make sure it gets there",
            "This is a crowd of people that have given up their time and money to come listen to you.  \n\nIt\u2019s very very unlikely none of them want to laugh, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be at a comedy club, so the question is, are you skilled enough at your craft to find the right jokes for that room?  If not, that\u2019s more on you than them.",
            "That he is prepared enough with the material, and good enough at what he does through experience, that he can pull off a good show. If the audience doesn\u2019t like it initially, he\u2019ll work harder to make them laugh. \n\nThe point he\u2019s making is about not leaving the show going well up to chance. If you\u2019re not well prepared, the show might go well if you\u2019re lucky. But leaving it up to luck it stupid an unprofessional - he\u2019s saying you need to be prepared to put on a good show, know what you\u2019re going to say well, etc. not leave it up to chance whether it goes well.",
            "The comment was also addressing how and why he\u2019s become so diligent about working out. Performance is exhausting, and you need to be somewhat physically fit in order to sustain the energy level required to give a good performance. \n\nSomeone who\u2019s out of shape is eventually going to hit a wall, and at that point they\u2019ll only be able to meet the audience where they\u2019re already at. A comic who\u2019s in good shape, who\u2019s unphased by the physical demand of their performance, is going to be better equipped to respond to the audience\u2019s energy and change it if necessary. \n\nI don\u2019t think he meant it as a blanket statement that every comic needs to live by \u2013 most of aren\u2019t performing hour-long arena shows anytime soon. But as far as his process goes, this seems to be what works for him.",
            "Start talking shit?",
            "Can\u2019t speak for him but what I think he means is becoming so good at the craft that even if the crowd sucks, you are still performing at a high level, and therefore doing well even if they\u2019re not that into it.",
            "It's also the mentality. A lot of comics will phone it in if they think the show sucks anyway. Some pro comic once told me you gotta go in with the mentality that you can be the reason the show doesn't suck. \n\nIt's a very cool attitude to have."
