            "In 2006, I was in Munich on a foreign exchange program during the World Cup that summer. \n\nI'll never forget the time we were by Marienplatz when we heard some breaking glass and a scuffle break out. A group of German police officers nearby very casually walk over, find the two fighting, rough them both up, then hog tie them. Then they proceeded to throw them in the back of the same police van next to each other and went back and stood where they were before like nothing happened. \n\nI always wondered the conversation between those two in the back of the van. It was still there an hour later on our way back to our house."
