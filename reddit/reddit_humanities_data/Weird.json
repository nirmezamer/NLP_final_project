The Zelenskyy impersonator was in Ukraine when the war broke out and the Kim impersonator was worried about him getting taken prisoner by the Russians to make propaganda for them. So he teamed up with a Putin impersonator to help get the Zelenskyy impersonator out of the country. I\u2019m not making this up.",

Racehorses obviously never meet their sires, and mares from various different barns are sent out to be bred to the same stallion, so the foals are not raised or trained by the same people either, and yet all of his sons shared his same personality. Very fast (he sired TWO derby winners - Sunny\u2019s Halo and Sunday Silence), and very violent and dangerous.",

An offering is accepted by nature when it is consumed by wildlife... usually with meat, a scavenger like a coyote or crows will eat it. If they are a scavenger, salmonella wont bother them. Of course the smallest wildlife(insects) will consume remnants as well.\nMany different faiths us celestial events as points for religious days. Solstices and equinoxes are common times.
