            "This could be interesting.  Clearly, Unity still has an image problem.  My biggest concern will be if this is just to make things look better, or if it will actually result in positive change.",
            "Yeah we all like Major Nelson but its never been super clear what he contributes besides being a hype man. I will say he's had good commentary on the gaming industry since leaving microsoft so it seems like hes got the right ideas but like I said idk if theyre paying him to take his advice on the direction of the engine.",
            "I used to listen to Major Nelson way back in the mid 2000s and enjoyed his Xbox coverage.  I can see him being a good fit for Unity, provided Unity really steps up in a major way.  I say this as the value of their engine right now as compared to the free open source options is more or less the same for flat screen games and even XR soon with Meta currently working on extending their XR SDK to Godot.  If Unity seriously delivers features and functions that speed up and make my development easier and justifies their fees, then I am ready to listen to Major Nelson again, but if Unity is going to continue to milk their engine while not being better than free options then I am moving to Godot as soon as the XR SDKs are available.  It is in your court Unity and slick marketing is not what will keep me in your engine.  I wish Larry all the best at Unity.",
            "Saw the activity on Twitter surrounding this, lots of optimism and positive energy:\n\n[https://x.com/majornelson/status/1802723522986536967](https://x.com/majornelson/status/1802723522986536967)\n\nHere's a retrospective on Major Nelson if anyone is curious, this guy was integral to X-box gaming for over a decade:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey2oaHGyKN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey2oaHGyKN0)\n\nNice to see more and more positive energy surrounding Unity and a desire to get back to basics. Larry's acquisition is just another example. More focus on features, more focus on competency, more focus on a positive image developers can believe in.\n\nHere's a video of Larry taking the heat from Angry Joe:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RtSGFryKwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RtSGFryKwo)\n\nHe's a bit corporate, but in the traditional sense. I doubt we'll be seeing more insane runtime fees trying to cover the cost of 5k employees with undefined jobs or futures. This is an improvement over the nonsensical decay we've been seeing within Unity the past several years. And you can't say this guy isn't willing to take the heat and have direct conversations with people, it takes some balls to let a YouTuber like Angry Joe unload on you with neckbeard fervor. Larry is a real one and you can tell from this interview he takes pride in his job, his company and will take the heat to stand up for those things.\n\nBetween all these picks for top roles of late and so much positive gains happening with Unity 6, getting a lot of confidence back for the future of this company. Who knows if this engine ever soars again in the future, but for now, just stoked to see they are stemming the bleeding. It's like waking from a bad dream.",
            "Hello all! I am excited to join the Unity team. I am not here just for looks - I am here to help change. Hit me on DM's if you don't feel like asking me anything in a public forum and I'll do my best to answer.",
            "It seems that this role might be similar to the one that he took with Midwest Games as the \"Advisor For Communications\".  I think they are doing better partially because of him, but I don't follow the company that well.  One thing that I do know is that he seemed to always be someone who was down to earth with gamers in general and those that met with him personally had good things to say.  So, fingers crossed.",
            "So are we going to need to talk to Major Nelson now when Unity once again sends us an email saying that we need to upgrade our license for nebulous reasons and then they ghost us when asking for clarification?",
            "This is bad bad bad Bad BAD.\n\nI mostly guarantee that Microsoft is aiming to aquire...\n\nThe deal is probably already done and its just a matter of thinning the herd.\n\nHow so?\n\nLook back at what happened to Nokia.  Once a former MS exec joins in, it isnt long before more show up until the reins become held by MS.\n\nI call it now...  Unity will be consumed by Microsoft.",
            "From a recent game jam I was a part of, a HUGE percentage of games are now being made in Godot. Not sure how that impacts Unity necessarily, but the movement away from Unity is actually very palpable.",
            "Larry is a PR guy. they're obviously doing it for image reasons. having said that, i really like Larry going back to the xbox 360 launch days."

If I can suggest something then I\u2019d say that you can stylize a few more elements to make the overall look more consistent and it can really be artistically unique. Imo the light beams and the starship materials could use some styling. Maybe go for an outline for more edges in starships and maybe add a little cel shading to them or simply make their material more matte, so they will look more detailed in close up. The light beams would be very appealing if they were more consistent with light beams from the sun in the background. Good luck with the game :)",

            "You don't have to use all of wind momentum to push boat. With correct angle sails can get some energy pushing them forward by wind coming from nearly front of boat. These were usually zig zagging against the wind so in a way... Yes they can. \n I believe in your case gpt would be great starting point towards starting research to get few references.",
            "I don\u2019t know how the square sails do it, but the triangular sails when viewed from above work similarly to a plane\u2019s wing. The sail is curved when filled with a breeze, and the shore resembles an airfoil. The wind passes over the leading edge and some goes \u2018above\u2019 (we\u2019re still visualizing it from above) and some goes below. The sail surface forms a high pressure underneath and lower pressure above, and the wind passes the trailing edge angled down. This \u2018Bernoulli effect\u2019 pushes the sail \u2018up\u2019 (like an airplane wing generates lift) \n\nThe key difference to the similarity to an airplane is a boat\u2019s hull has a keel. Otherwise the wind would be pushing the boat backward. \n\nWith the keel at an angle to the \u2018wing\u2019(sail), the boat instead travels in the path of least resistance. Which is forward, against the wind, but at an angle. \n\nWhat angle? Different geometries behave differently, but 45 degrees is probably a good approximation.\n\nhttps://letstalkscience.ca/sites/default/files/styles/width_800px/public/2021-11/action_reaction_lift.png?itok=GGMWQjBf\n\nhttp://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/sailing.html",
            "The cloth physics are nice. Is that your own or a plugin? if yours did you use verlet integration?",
            "As far as I'm aware, ancient ships didn't have the right sails or keel to 'tack' into the wind and so relied on rowing oars when heading into wind.",
            "Jibe ho!",
            "it depends how \"sim\" you want to go with it. \n\nSea of thieves doesn't really sim much, the game tracks a wind direction, sail angle and how opened the sail is, and the game makes a clamped speed calculation based on that. Wind speed doesn't change, the direction shifts a small amount constantly, the ships have different max speeds in different kinds of wind direction, and the ship just moves at its set speed based on the calculation. The game also allows the ship to move slowly upwind but tacking can be more effective, especially with the medium ship, the Brig which goes fastest in a crosswind.\n\nOr you could go full sim and try to calculate the amount of push your sail configuration has, like Sailwind does, but this can be janky and might be a major hindrance in combat. The wrong configuration can make the ship impossible to control, add too big a sail to your ship and the thing might capsize from an errant crosswind",
            "You can't sail directly into the wind. You usually sail at 45 degrees, but that alone isn't enough as the wind will still push the boat sideways. You use the keel/centreboard to convert that to forward momentum. \n\nI feel like it would be very hard to replicate in unity, at least hard in my head lol. It could be faked fairly easily however.",
            "Exactly...in sailing, it's called tacking and would be difficult but possible to mimick.",
            "Indeed, many places have mentioned this kind of operation, but I didn't understand the physical principles behind it. It's impressive that ancient people could master such a skill.",
            "Thank you very much for your explanation and the materials you provided."
