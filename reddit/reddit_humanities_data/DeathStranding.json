Use \\[SPOILER\\] tags and flairs (**Important:** Check the sidebar or [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/wiki/spoiler-policy) for details.)\n2. No spoilers in post titles or thumbnails\n3. Don't spoil in the comments if the post isn't tagged as \"spoilers\"\n4. Don't spoil the events of further chapters\n\nPlease report any untagged spoilers! You will greatly help the moderators and the community.\n\n\\--\n\n**2. Do you have questions?** Well, good news!

The mask in form of hands alone sold me on this game and this world, everything else was just perfection, excellency and dare I say ABSOLUTE CINEMA!\n\nA ten minute trailer and Kojima says there are only hints to what the story will be. There are entire movies with less emotion, creativity and complexity than in this trailer alone. \n\nKojima, you will forever be untouchable in this industry."

Knew things would keep getting better, but wow. This game.\n\nThere's something about it that captivates me. I can't put my finger on what it is. It's magnetic.\n\nI've not long started playing really (porter level 98), but immediately I knew this was going to be an experience as well as a game. \n\nI read all the emails, all the interviews, shower, rest and use the facilities regularly, pick up all lost cargo I see, give likes to everything i can, constantly double back on myself to get an easier, safer route if required, take my time and assess things when out delivering, care for Sam, care for the BB, care for the vehicle and everything else I can do as if it were me actually there.\n\nAnd I'm not sure why I do that. I feel I must. I want to. I'm all in.\n\nThe actual delivering of the cargo and the resultant appreciation from the recipient and seeing progress and connections being made means something. It's beyond a game.\n\nIt's another level above, and the thought that I've got the majority to play through makes me deliriously happy, and is exactly the reason I bought a PS5. For games that give you an experience along with the playing.\n\nAnd this one is delivering an experience beyond what I thought was possible.\n\nEpic is a big understatement. And there will be a DS2 as well. Happy days indeed.",
