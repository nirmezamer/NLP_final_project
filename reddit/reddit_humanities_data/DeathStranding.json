        "content": "Hello there, porters! As we approach another new horizon, I'd like to share some vital reminders:\n\n**1. Be mindful of others and mark any spoilers** in your submissions/comments. Although the main game has been out for a while, there are still many people experiencing Death Stranding for the first time!\n\nGeneral rules:\n\n1. Use \\[SPOILER\\] tags and flairs (**Important:** Check the sidebar or [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/wiki/spoiler-policy) for details.)\n2. No spoilers in post titles or thumbnails\n3. Don't spoil in the comments if the post isn't tagged as \"spoilers\"\n4. Don't spoil the events of further chapters\n\nPlease report any untagged spoilers! You will greatly help the moderators and the community.\n\n\\--\n\n**2. Do you have questions?** Well, good news! Chances are, they have already been answered before!\n\n**Please search the subreddit before asking** or check our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/wiki/faq#wiki_frequently_asked_questions). A quick query usually pops up some useful results, but if your question is unique and hasn't been answered before, please feel free to ask!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**P.S.** Some posts might be removed if they don't comply with the subreddit rules, and some posts end up categorized as \"spam\" by Reddit itself. The spam filters seem a tad bit too aggressive as of right now, but since it's a site-wide initiative, there isn't much we can do to help it. If your submission gets deleted, please don't be offended! We check all the submissions manually, and we'll get to yours as soon as possible.",
