Instantly loved the lifestyle, enjoying what I ate (but missing carbs the first bit) and learning to be very creative with meal prep, both cooking at home and eating out. Losing the water weight at the start was very motivating to stay focused. \n\nAll the good things happened\u2026\n\n-My resting heart rate (according to my Fitbit) was at 80BPM when I started. It has been 51-52BPM the last week in June. \n\n-I had high blood pressure. I was on 4 different medications. About 2 months in I started going to medical clinic every few weeks for a BPTrue reading, doctor got on board with lowering my meds. 2 weeks ago I weaned off my last medication. No more pills! BP is now naturally perfect. I found with each medication I dropped, I felt even better. \n\n-Clothing sizes went from a 3-4XL, down to 1-2XL. Waist size went 44\u201d -> 36\u201d. Shopping at skinny people stores again!\n\n-Snoring completely gone.\n\n-I get a dental cleaning every 4-6mos\u2026 Historically my front bottom teeth would be coated with white plaque/scale by every appt. Cleaning appt next week and my teeth still look perfect. \n\n-Began fasting\u2026 18:6, 20:4, OMAD infrequently. Done a few extended fasts 44-52hrs. Crazy how keeping insulin constantly low does so well at curbing your hunger.\n\n-Cold water plunges 1-4x a week. Fill bathtub with cold tapwater anywhere from 50-60F. Sit in it for 5 mins. My body can crave this at times now and it gives me so much energy and happiness afterwards.\n\n-My old bicycle and the stairs at work went from being my enemies, to my new best friends.\n\n-My wife has also lost 100, being motivated towards a common goal has helped us support each other so much!\n\nI always thought the stress factors in life were due to having young kids, being a shiftworker, getting older, etc\u2026 Almost feeling no stress at all lately! A complete 180 on life. Sugar cravings are completely gone. I have lost the interest in drinking for now. More than 3 drinks makes me feel like crap. \n\nI love the lifestyle, lurking this sub, and continuously learning about it all! Good luck to everyone and keep up the good work.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hey guys - I'm having a rare mental triumph  tonight, so felt like sharing my story. Hope you don't mind.\n\nFirst, stats: I'm 40, male, from the UK, and have a looong history of obesity and yo-yo dieting. I've been battling obesity/ED since my teens. I'm 6'0 and started a HEALTHY keto diet on 1 September 2023, when I weighed 365lb. As of today (28 June 2024), I now weigh 238lb. Total loss of 127lb so far, with 40lb more until goal.\n\nPic if you want to see my progress:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/g5oo1bs](https://imgur.com/a/g5oo1bs)\n\n**My story:**\n\nJust over nine months ago, on 19/08/23, my friend Emma took me to A&E (ER) as I had chest pains. I was frightened: I had a family history of heart issues (my dad died of a heart attack when he was 32 and I was 3 months old), I was nearing 40, and I weighed 365lb.\n\nIt turned out my heart was fine, but my life changed that day. After decades of bulimia and weight fluctuation, I'd had enough of living a life of worry and extremes. I stopped glorifying the time in my 20s when I'd lost 84lb through crash dieting on the Cambridge Weight Plan, drinking nothing but shakes for eight months. While that approach had been wildly successful in terms of weight loss, it had done NOTHING to change my mindset - indeed, it had set me back mentally, as it had allowed me not to think about food at all. It had enabled the worst of my thinking while showing a \"good\" result on the scales.\n\nAnd, of course, it didn't last: once I hit \"goal\", which coincided with the height of my social life in London, I slowly but surely put all the weight back on again, plus many pounds more. Over the next ten years, I ended up way heavier than I'd ever been, without ever having addressed the real problem: my mind. I'd even had cognitive behavioural therapy and one-on-one psychotherapy during that time, but it didn't work because, frankly, I didn't \\*want\\* it to work at that time. I'd tell the therapists what they wanted to hear, then go home and binge.\n\nThat's how the next ten years went. Until that day last year that I ended up in the hospital, approaching 40 years old, scared out of my wits that I was having the kind of heart attack that had killed my own father when he was seven years younger than me.\n\nLike I say, my heart was OK so I got a free pass that day. But I wasn't relieved: I was still terrified. I decided to apply everything I'd learned about keto/low-carb from the past 20 years (but never correctly followed), but this time to do it PROPERLY. I embarked on a regime of sustainable low-carb eating and cardio. It wasn't about my appearance this time, as it had been when I was younger: I was nearly 40 now, so my primary goal this time was improving my health.\n\nAND IT WAS FRICKIN HARD. What made it harder for me, of course, is that I'd had ED my entire adult life. That meant thinking about food is exhausting. Starving is as easy as bingeing because neither requires us to make conscious decisions about food. I had to take two months off work (which, as a civil servant, my amazing bosses thankfully supported) just to train my mind to think about choosing/preparing/eating the right foods every day. First for one meal a day, then two... and slowly, with immense difficulty, I established a routine: eating enough sensible food (while not feeling guilty about it), and accompanying it with cardio through Peloton (which I now can't live without and I thoroughly recommend if you can afford to buy or rent one).\n\nNine months on, and I still have huge wobbles: on some days I want to eat the world, and on others I \\*crave\\* an empty stomach. I also sometimes have to remind myself not to be sad when I don't show a loss on the scales. But I've mostly learned not to chase those numbers: while I've now lost 127lb since that worrying day in the hospital, the hardest weight for me to shed was the guilt I associated with food. I'm only now reintroducing foods I love once a week (hello, Pringles), and retraining myself to remember there are no inherently 'good' or 'bad' foods, only best practice.\n\nI'm in the final stretch now; I should feel great about that, but in truth it's still hard on some days because I will still always have to live with ED. But SUSTAINABLE keto has evened out my cravings so that my wobbles are now maybe once a week instead of every day; and what keeps me going is that I feel better today at 40 than I did at 20. For the first time in my entire forty years on this planet, I have a feeling of BALANCE. It's weird. But I like it.",

This literally stops me craving sugar and I notice mental health improvement when I am eating daily. When I run out and I haven't made a fresh batch I do notice more anxiety thoughts creeping in. It is to do with if there are more bad bacteria they live off sugar and the gut is linked to the brain so it tries to hijack your mind to crave sugar by increasing the reward pathways. But when there are more good bacteria these cravings disappear. Serotonin is also stored in the gut and travels up to the brain so if the gut is not in a good state you can get anxiety / depression.",
