        "content": "Hey guys - I'm having a rare mental triumph  tonight, so felt like sharing my story. Hope you don't mind.\n\nFirst, stats: I'm 40, male, from the UK, and have a looong history of obesity and yo-yo dieting. I've been battling obesity/ED since my teens. I'm 6'0 and started a HEALTHY keto diet on 1 September 2023, when I weighed 365lb. As of today (28 June 2024), I now weigh 238lb. Total loss of 127lb so far, with 40lb more until goal.\n\nPic if you want to see my progress:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/g5oo1bs](https://imgur.com/a/g5oo1bs)\n\n**My story:**\n\nJust over nine months ago, on 19/08/23, my friend Emma took me to A&E (ER) as I had chest pains. I was frightened: I had a family history of heart issues (my dad died of a heart attack when he was 32 and I was 3 months old), I was nearing 40, and I weighed 365lb.\n\nIt turned out my heart was fine, but my life changed that day. After decades of bulimia and weight fluctuation, I'd had enough of living a life of worry and extremes. I stopped glorifying the time in my 20s when I'd lost 84lb through crash dieting on the Cambridge Weight Plan, drinking nothing but shakes for eight months. While that approach had been wildly successful in terms of weight loss, it had done NOTHING to change my mindset - indeed, it had set me back mentally, as it had allowed me not to think about food at all. It had enabled the worst of my thinking while showing a \"good\" result on the scales.\n\nAnd, of course, it didn't last: once I hit \"goal\", which coincided with the height of my social life in London, I slowly but surely put all the weight back on again, plus many pounds more. Over the next ten years, I ended up way heavier than I'd ever been, without ever having addressed the real problem: my mind. I'd even had cognitive behavioural therapy and one-on-one psychotherapy during that time, but it didn't work because, frankly, I didn't \\*want\\* it to work at that time. I'd tell the therapists what they wanted to hear, then go home and binge.\n\nThat's how the next ten years went. Until that day last year that I ended up in the hospital, approaching 40 years old, scared out of my wits that I was having the kind of heart attack that had killed my own father when he was seven years younger than me.\n\nLike I say, my heart was OK so I got a free pass that day. But I wasn't relieved: I was still terrified. I decided to apply everything I'd learned about keto/low-carb from the past 20 years (but never correctly followed), but this time to do it PROPERLY. I embarked on a regime of sustainable low-carb eating and cardio. It wasn't about my appearance this time, as it had been when I was younger: I was nearly 40 now, so my primary goal this time was improving my health.\n\nAND IT WAS FRICKIN HARD. What made it harder for me, of course, is that I'd had ED my entire adult life. That meant thinking about food is exhausting. Starving is as easy as bingeing because neither requires us to make conscious decisions about food. I had to take two months off work (which, as a civil servant, my amazing bosses thankfully supported) just to train my mind to think about choosing/preparing/eating the right foods every day. First for one meal a day, then two... and slowly, with immense difficulty, I established a routine: eating enough sensible food (while not feeling guilty about it), and accompanying it with cardio through Peloton (which I now can't live without and I thoroughly recommend if you can afford to buy or rent one).\n\nNine months on, and I still have huge wobbles: on some days I want to eat the world, and on others I \\*crave\\* an empty stomach. I also sometimes have to remind myself not to be sad when I don't show a loss on the scales. But I've mostly learned not to chase those numbers: while I've now lost 127lb since that worrying day in the hospital, the hardest weight for me to shed was the guilt I associated with food. I'm only now reintroducing foods I love once a week (hello, Pringles), and retraining myself to remember there are no inherently 'good' or 'bad' foods, only best practice.\n\nI'm in the final stretch now; I should feel great about that, but in truth it's still hard on some days because I will still always have to live with ED. But SUSTAINABLE keto has evened out my cravings so that my wobbles are now maybe once a week instead of every day; and what keeps me going is that I feel better today at 40 than I did at 20. For the first time in my entire forty years on this planet, I have a feeling of BALANCE. It's weird. But I like it.",

            "For that final stage, have you tried any of the following: \n\n- Sorting out your gut microbiome by eating homemade kimchi? This literally stops me craving sugar and I notice mental health improvement when I am eating daily. When I run out and I haven't made a fresh batch I do notice more anxiety thoughts creeping in. It is to do with if there are more bad bacteria they live off sugar and the gut is linked to the brain so it tries to hijack your mind to crave sugar by increasing the reward pathways. But when there are more good bacteria these cravings disappear. Serotonin is also stored in the gut and travels up to the brain so if the gut is not in a good state you can get anxiety / depression."

            "I've lost 95lb since mid november last year. Don't be fooled into thinking that what you lose at the start of keto will continue at the same rate. I've had periods of several weeks where the scale hasn't moved at all. I actually started keto to treat some health issues, which have been fixed, but the weightloss has motivated me to get healthy all round and continue.\n\nI'm in my late 30's and have pretty much always had weight issues my whole life, I have lost large amounts of weight a couple of times now, this being my 3rd attempt (but my first attempt with keto). \n\nAt the start I falsely believed that keto was some magical diet where I could eat bacon/butter/steak, and still be a fat burning furnace. Over time I realised that I still have to eat clean and healthy, but the REAL benefits of keto come indirectly...such as appetite control, increased energy, sense of wellbeing etc. I find a low calorie keto diet far easier to follow than a standard low calorie carb diet. Took me a while to realise there was nothing mysterious about being in ketosis, it is not a magical bullet or a license to eat poorly...you still have to think about calories in/calories out.\n\nI spent a few months doing OMAD every day, for me it had mixed results. I loved how convenient it was, and it somehow felt psychologically easier...but the truth was I just wasn't getting the macros and nutrients I needed. I now mostly eat twice a day, my first meal is post workout in the AM and fairly small. My main (and last) meal is late afternoon where I eat the bulk of my macros. I still throw in a few OMAD days over the course of a week...but never every day. Tbh, my weightloss has increased...but maybe OMAD will suit you better than it did me.\n\nI have actually lost weight quicker on other diets, but I suspect that it was also muscle mass. I find keto great for muscle retention, and I feel like the weight I lose is all fat...though I could be wrong. It feels more of a body recomposition than straight weight loss. At times the scale hasn't moved, but my clothes fit better. The weightloss rate can feel weird...a bit stop/start and periods like I say, where the scale doesn't change at all.\n\nLastly, you definately reach a point of homeostasis when it comes to carbs and cravings etc. I quite literally have no cravings for carbs anymore. 3/4 months ago on my birthday I cracked and ate some chocolate even though I wasn't all that bothered, and it was like my palette had changed...it didn't taste of much, not like I had imagined, and kind of chemically sweet. That same day I also ate some pizza and fries...I didn't enjoy any of it and actually couldn't wait to get back on keto.\n\nThis comment went on longer than planned, but good luck with it all. I think you are on the right path, you just need a little patience at times with keto. Sometimes you feel you aren't getting anywhere...just stick to the plan and realise that with consistency you will reach your goal.",
            "Congratulations! Lugging around 25 pounds less is definitely a win in my book! :-)\n\nI've tried OMAD on a few occasions but it really doesn't seem to agree with me. I feel super hungry mid-morning, so I usually have some breakfast (~300 kcal) and lunch (~1kcal). But if OMAD works for you, that's fantastic!\n\n- At ~300 pounds, a 1600 kcal diet seems to be a large enough deficit, so you're fine. Overtime you might want to lower it down a little bit. However be mindful that at some point it won't be effective anymore. IE, I can't eat under 1200 kcals consistently, I find myself overeating the next day. It's better to stay at say 1600 kcals and introduce some physical activity to create/increase the deficit. (But that's a concern for the longer time, not right now).\n\n- Ensure you're having at least 50gr of fat per day, and around 2gr per kg of target body weight. In your case, that'd be 200gr protein, 50gr fat = 1350 kcals per day. (Protein seems a bit high, but might make sense if you're a tall folk). Add more fat/protein to reach satiety and/or reach your TDEE).\n\n- As others have said, weight loss is non-linear, so don't expect the scale to move downwards everyday. If you want to keep track, try also tracking your bodily measurements (arms, waist, etc). Also photos of yourself. We're all specially bad at looking at ourselves and seeing differences, so photos can help. This is specially good if the scale is not showing progress from some reason.\n\n- Stalls are a thing, as well as whooshes. A whoosh is a period where you start losing lots of weight in a short time frame for no reason -- typically it's lots of peeing and can happen after a stall. The current understanding is that the body tries to keep the same weight over time, and replace lost fat with water. At some point it realises that the water is no longer needed and releases it as urine.\n\nAt this point, you're in over 3 weeks so your body is getting used to this way of eating, so congrats! The hardest part is probably over, you're having your electrolytes under control and now it's a matter of keep calm, keto on. Congrats!",
