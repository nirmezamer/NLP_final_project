In Reddit we have ***'upvote'*** and ***'downvote'***.  They apply to both posts and comments. The visibility of interactions are sorted based on upvotes & downvotes, with high upvote post or comment seen higher in the feed. \n\nYour accumulated upvotes minus downvotes is recorded as your ***'karma'***  points. In your profile details, post karma and comment karma are visible. Those are the site-wide karma, meaning points you gained anywhere in reddit.\n\nIn fb, you follow people and pages. In reddit, the communities you join or view are called subreddits (phcareers is one of them). Subreddit or community specific karma actually exists. Your karma breakdown details per subreddit is available at old.reddit.\n\nTo gain comment karma for r/phcareers, you can take advantage of the help thread. Outside that thread, new user interaction is invisible to the community. Until you pass the threshold point, you cannot participate in the comment section of any post submitted. Likewise, post submission karma requirements are higher than comment karma threshold.\n\nWe recently implemented this as 'bot attack' protection, a site-wide problem. Bots don't deserve visibility, they only farm karma for their accounts to be later used for spam/scam.\n\nIf you are a living breathing person who wants to participate within the community by posting or commenting, comply to phcareers' minimum karma requirements (as already specified in your removal notification).",

        "content": "Hello, help a girlie out. \n\nContext: In the banking industry for 8 years already, currently in my 3rd bank.  My last employer (Company A) is a midsize bank where the culture was a good fit kaso they lack of manpower and has lower pay than other banks. I quit last January because a bigger bank (Company B) noticed my LinkedIn profile and offered me a 45% bump from my current salary for the same role and same rank (Junior Officer). They both offer hybrid setup.\n\nDuring the interview, I was told a multitude of things that hyped me up:\n- same number of areas to handle\n- Unit has substantial budget - i'd be able to come up with programs with no issue\n- system is good and will be upgraded soon\n- 2 days WFH\n\n I was looking for mentorship and a support system since I was located offsite during my stint in Company A. I was good at my job, worked well with my peers, and was also up for promotion. But even with the salary increase, di parin niya abot yung offer ni Company B. My boss tried to counter but HR disapproved the request kasi di pa ako nag 2-years tenure (1.5 years in the role)\n\nSo I left, and was in good spirits thinking i'd be going to a better place but the longer I stayed the more I get disappointed with Company B. Parang gumuho po ang aking mundo. All the promises did not materialize.\n- systems? - legacy systems na mukhang mas matanda pa saken na di talaga ata mapapalitan.\n- everything is manual kaya admin heavy\n-  comms are through senior management so cascade is always late. Ako madedehado always kasi nga late.\n- budget? Pahirapan po. TY yung mga reim ko.\n- extreme hierarchy systems in place = di mo makausap yung di mo kalevel.\n- yung area assignment? Nako 3x assigned sa akin.\n- joke time lang ata yung wfh kasi di mo ma access important systems if you are not connected sa office network\n\nMy bosses are too busy to catch up on my progress and train me...and I honestly feel like I'm drowning. I've been working daily until 10PM just to catch up, even during weekends pa, pero di talaga siya enough. Since naka legacy systems parin, ang daming unecessary admin work. Even data I need for reports laging 2 months behind.\n\nI was able to tell my supervisor how I feel about this job and yung response lang is I need to adjust daw. \n\nI also feel like my boss is really out for me kasi she thinks I'm not up to par vs the one I'm replacing (senior manager and was in the same role for 10+ years vs me na 2 years pa handling the product). Already been humiliated 3x this month over minor things that could have been resolved through an email. \n\nThe last nail in the box was me getting reprimanded just for asking clarification regarding a new policy na I was not looped into. I sent an email directly to the senior manager who sent the original email with the policy. Since both of my managers are out, I thought it would be better to receive confirmation immediately from their unit since operations are being impeded by the new policy. I get an angry call from my boss saying I bypassed her and I should not do it again. Shocked by this since in my previous companies, ma-appreciate pa ng managers mo when you proactively ask questions, nagfyi nalang ako before to higher ups para informed din sila.\n\nI'm no longer sure if I want to stay here longer. The traditional setup and office politics is draining me and I'm really tired physically, emotionally, and mentally. The pay is good but I'm not getting the support I need to grow into the role.\n\nNow my previous employer is open to hiring me back since wala pa sila na-hire to replace me but I'm also thinking of switching industries because sukang-suka na ko sa banking. Medyo high stress lang din right now because I'm reaching the end of my probationary period and I'm not even sure if they still want me here.\n\nTLDR:\nI'm struggling sa workload and culture and sa new company and I'm thinking of going back to old employer.\n\nQ1 :What should I expect if ever babalik ako kay former employer?\nQ2: How is working for Fintech companies like? Been thinking of switching to this from banking.",

            "Aw baka sa dept nyo lang. Bottomline, wag ka na bumalik and yung assessment mo of those cultures ay gamitin mo sa paghanap ng bago. \n\nHabang nagtitiis siguro widen your network within the company.

            "Don't go back unless they contact you to come back. It's a bit pathetic to go back.\n\nStay with your current company as long as you can. Use this as leverage in job hunting.\nMove on to other companies. Research employee feedback before signing up with any company.\n\nOn bypassing your manager, regardless of which company, learn the protocol first before going directly to higher level managers. They are busy and may not appreciate inquiries that can be resolved by lower level managers or personnel.",
            "Hi! If you're in a good team magtatagal ka talaga :) I lasted this long because I was in units with very good bosses and teammates who helped me succeed in the roles I had in the industry.\n\nSince RM ka, you are handling VIP clients no? Expect life and death talaga from that segment  I suggest you discover what you like about your current job and see if it's transferrable to other departments (na not client facing). Best of luck! \n\nBanking can be lucrative and stable but it also comes with high stress levels because finances are involved."
