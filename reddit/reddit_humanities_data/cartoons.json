The last 4 of which all have a bit of VA work in their history, but they could certainly use some more for sure.\n\nThe point being that there certainly isn't much of a shortage for fantastic asian(of descent at least, if they weren't born in asia) actresses out there \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nGreatly love all who have been listed by op and myself.
