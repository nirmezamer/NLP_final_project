            "I\u2019m sorry for the news. They care about you and for many people, a house is the largest and most valuable asset they have. \n\n1. They paid $30k for it, but when the house transfers to you, you gain a tremendous benefit: the \u201cbasis\u201d of the house will reset to current market price. If you were to sell immediately, there would be no taxable gain since you\u2019d gain $0. Since the house never re-appraised, the residential property taxes will also remain set at theoretical last appraisal done on the house. Likely the property taxes owed on the house are substantially less than what would be owed if you bought the house new. \n\n2. If you rent the house out, you can sell the house in a \u201c1031 Exchange\u201d and transfer the built-up equity and basis into another house (or multiple properties) of \u201clike kind and value\u201d to keep renting out. Simply put, the money you\u2019d make from the sale of their house could be applied toward 1 or more rental houses elsewhere (even in Idaho or other states) so you could have a nice income stream. Note: 1031 exchanges are only for rental properties, not for a place you live in. You cannot commingle the gains in 1031 into a house you live in without paying capital gains / taxes. \n\nVERY importantly \u2014 you need to find out if the instrument that transfers the property WILL NOT be subject to probate. Probate is a court process to determine the deceased assets and liabilities and square them up before executing the last will and testament instructions. The proceeds of probate are TAXED in most places and it can eat a lot of your inheritance up. \n\nSkipping this mess can usually be accomplished by having a TOD (\u201cTransfer On Death\u201d) document witnessed and signed by all parties, usually recorded with the County Recorder\u2019s Office. This lets you skip probate (and costly probate taxes). Check with the County Recorder\u2019s Office where the house is located to inquire about a TOD. \n\nYou can do the same with bank accounts; you can make them POD (\u201cPayable Upon Death\u201d) and do something similar with stocks / bonds / CDs. Brokerage accounts, if they have any, usually have a beneficiary process. Each brokerage will have different forms and a slightly different method to confirm the account owner\u2019s wishes. \n\nAll of this is a tremendous gift. I doubt your grandparents want the tax man to take half because of some simple paperwork. Talk to them about it if it turns out there\u2019s no TOD and see if they are amenable to singing one and getting that in place else the tax burden could be quite substantial. \n\nOf course, consult with qualified professionals to make sure you\u2019re doing all this by the book and the right way. \n \nGood luck and I\u2019m sorry to hear your grandparents are in the years of their twilight. How wonderful that they think so highly of you.",

After countless showings and 40+ days on the market we finally got an offer; recent reduction helped. \n\nIt was a low-ball offer but not so far away that we couldn\u2019t counter.  I countered\u2026. They countered.  Ultimately, I was around $5k away from my minimum amount I wanted to clear. \n\nI told my realtor, the sales price is acceptable if the buyers agent can take 2% (in other words, I would pay 5% commission).  My realtor responded with a thumbs up emoji at 7:15 PM and I didn\u2019t hear from him again until the next day at 9:15 AM. He texts me, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this agent can\u2019t get her clients up 6k. BS imo\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a little confused as I told him the sales price is agreed upon and it\u2019s up to the realtors to take a reduction of 1% in commissions.  \n\nI start heeding questions from my realtor about another buyer who visited the property the previous day\u2026. Almost as if he\u2019s avoiding the subject. Finally at 6:00 PM today, I ask about the buyer with an offer\u2026. His reply \u201cit died, they wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201csales price was finalized, did the commission reduction kill it?\u201d\n\nRealtor: \u201cyep. No worries, we are moving on.\u201d\n\nMy wife and I are at dinner thinking WTF is going on and perplexed how our realtor and personal friend could be so nonchalant about the only offer we have seen in 1.5 months.\n\nAfter dinner, realtor and I exchange more text and it leads to me demanding a phone call immediately. I end up scolding him and corner him into him telling me that he never relayed the acceptance of the sales price offer with a 1% commission reduction to the other agent.  I called him a greedy fucker that lied to me because he couldn\u2019t fathom a $2500 reduction on commission also knowing I\u2019m about to use him to purchase a $850k+ house.\n\nI made him revive the deal and am now waiting to see if this will finalize.

            "This makes no sense..why would you say your agent was greedy when you only asked the buyer's agent to take a  1% cut..maybe the reason your house has not sold is more a reflection on you..as it would have been better to ask both agents to each reduce by 1/2%",

I would be cautious though about the buyers trying to re-trade after an inspection and further reduce purchase price. \n\nHowever, there are several ways to fix this, including using (or threatening to use) a different realtor for the purchase of your next house.

But anyways, she does the video. She loved our little house. Great. I was stunned at how unprofessional she was. Reeked of cigarette smoke and just her entire presentation, but I guess she wasn\u2019t meeting with her clients that might be why. \n\nBuyers put in an offer at list price. We\u2019re thrilled. Inspection happens, a few things come up, nothing major but definitely things here and there. Inspection period passes without a word from their realtor, they didn\u2019t ask for anything.

But then I tried to deflect and say that we don\u2019t like heating the pool anyways because if you need it heated then the air is too cold to enjoy swimming.
