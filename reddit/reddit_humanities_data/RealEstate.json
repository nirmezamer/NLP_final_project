        "content": "TLDR: We went to look at a house for sale in with a broken garage door, and now the listing agent wants us to pay for it. We think we are getting conned. \n\nFull story: My husband and I went to view a house for sale. This house is a fixer-upper and is listed Sold As-Is. Before we finished our tour, we wanted to see the garage and try the garage door. The garage door opened but when we went to close it got stuck halfway down. Upon inspection you could see there was lots of damage to the door and they had a handyman put it back on its rails.   \n  \nOur agent called the listing agent to tell them that we are unable to close the garage door but will lock up the house so that no one can enter the property further, but that they need to have someone come fix the door since its obviously broken. They did not disclose this anywhere in the listing.\n\nThe listing agent claims we are responsible for damaging the garage door and liable for damages and need to pay for the door to be repaired. Of course, this is ridiculous because they never disclosed the issues with the garage door. Also I had my infant with me during the tour and we could have been seriously hurt if the door came down on us. Its completely off the rails at this point and sideways.   \n  \nAfterward we checked Google Maps and the street view of the house from 2023 showed the same broken door (stuck open and ajar) so it's obvious this was a preexisting issue.   \n  \nWe think we are being conned into fixing a door they knew had problems. This house has been listed for a long time and fell out of escrow at one point we suspected there was something wrong with the property.  (It was a rental and there was drug paraphernalia all over the backyard. We would not have brought our baby if we thought it would be is such dire condition. )\n\nOur agent asked to speak with the listing agent's broker but they refused to provide their broker's contact saying they are protecting their identity. \n\nThis all seems super shady and is not our problem. Anyone had such a sideways experience with real estate?\n\nI have spoken to several agents and they all said they've never had an experience like this. Needless to say, we are NOT interested in the property now!\n\n",

Today our landlord reached out saying his lender is requesting copies of my husband and I\u2019s tax returns from 2018-2022. He said they are requesting this because his loan payments are income based and he recently disclosed on the phone, but not yet on paper, that he is renting the property, so they requested this additional documentation for their files. This seems really strange and unnecessary. \n\nOur incomes do not apply or affect his income in any way. We meet the income requirements he set for renting the property. I feel the only info that should concern the bank is the date we started renting, our monthly rent payment, and verifying through our landlord\u2019s bank statement that the payments are there. Is there something I\u2019m missing here? Why would a bank need access to the tenant\u2019s financial history? Our finances are obviously completely separate from our landlord\u2019s. ",

However, they don't get to scrutinize my tenants.",

As a result water has been pooling in mine and other neighbor's yards. The building Inspector was by and made the builder fix the drainage. Apparently it wasn't enough and they need to grade it more because the builder contacted my real estate agent (because I'm in the middle of selling) and says they need to tear down my fence and are claiming a drainage easement.\n\nI don't have an easement. No documentation I have from the sale doesn't list an easement. My ctiys website said to find easements you should hire a lawyer or title company because they don't have a single pane of glass to view all easements in the city. My title company didn't find anything when I bought my house.\n\nI do have a suspicion that they added a drainage easement after the builder started to build his new duplexes but that was well after I bought. If it was added after I purchased and I didn't sign anything then the easement isn't my problem, right? Or if it did exist but the title company missed it, then it's their problem?\n\nIt's just such a headache and I'm half-suspecting the builder is just being a dick because his houses aren't selling and I'm undercutting his price.",
