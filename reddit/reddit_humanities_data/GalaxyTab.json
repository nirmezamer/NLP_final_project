Having two app on split screen feels really good and with a huge of space without my hand taking a lot of space. The battery is at 98% after using it for more than an hour with youtube and samsung notes side by side and about an hour of hulu. The brightness is almost at its lowest and even there it feels bright and comfortable to my eyes. I had the Tab A 8.0 with Spen and then the S6lite 2020, and this thing its huge. \n\nI was going to send a link to someone for them to buy  and they are now at $269/309.",

            "I just got my Tab S7FE not even a full 30 days ago and I love it!\n\nI use it for video editing and writing when I'm at work. Better than taking my SteamDeck to work lol.",
            "kinda regret of getting a s9 fe since both s7 fe and s9 fe have similar spec, but the s7 fe is bigger, otg and more efficient chipset.",
            "I'm not usually so much of an FE fan but honestly 209 for an S7 FE is fantastic. Enjoy.",
            "If it is not that cheap, the Tab S7 Fe is a bad tablet.\nA commentary from a Tab S7 FE user.\n\nBy the way you can ask whatever you want.",
            "This is the wifi version. I saw the 5g one cost more but everywhere I looked it said to go for the wifi one because it was better.",
            "Ohh nice. I've been using it with an external monitor and I'm impressed with it and that I can ise it as a secondary display for my laptop its great. Now I dont have to carry the external monitor with me just tablet and laptop!\n\nI'm still not used to the big screen its almost as big as my laptop screen.",
            "But I had the s6 lite 2020 previously and I only use it for drawing/writing and streaming. So for me it's perfect! I have a s22u for heavier stuff. I don't play games on them!"

I usually don't even notice the dips.\n\nI used the Tab S9+ as my primary gacha gaming device for a few days over my PC and it held up just fine. If only both games would give us actual, native controller support, and I would be really happy.",
            "Oh it's pretty good, probably the only gacha with combat mechanics being this good and isn't as brain dead as genshin. I love genshin but the combat in Wuthering is something.\n\nI'll warn you that the first four acts of the story is pretty meh, it gets good starting act five",
            "I like it. It can be more of an action game like DMC than Genshin can. You have more buttons you can press with animation cancelling, quick swapping, etc, and more pressing buttons = more fun to me."

Returned it for S6 Lite 2024 4/64. Love it, writing is really good and watching YT vids are good as well. Are there any S6 Lite user here? specifically 2024 version. How long would it last me for my usage? What is the lifespan of the 2024 version? Until 2028? I would like to know if I can use my S6 Lite 24 for at least 10+ years. Or should I return and add $100 more for S9FE. ",
