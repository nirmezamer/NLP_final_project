My S8 Ultra is my on-the-go gaming machine, if a game like this doesn't have controller support, I won't play it. Touch controls are generally garbage for a game as fast-paced as Genshin imo.",
            "I have Genshin on highest resolution setting and medium everything else, and that gets me a solid 60 FPS.\n\nWuWa is on medium everything and that gets me around 50-55 FPS with maybe some dips into the 40s when there's a lot of particle effects happening. I usually don't even notice the dips.\n\nI used the Tab S9+ as my primary gacha gaming device for a few days over my PC and it held up just fine. If only both games would give us actual, native controller support, and I would be really happy."
