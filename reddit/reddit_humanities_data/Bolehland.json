        "content": "Rule 1\n\nRemember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n\nRule 2\n\nAbide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Reddit communities.\n\nRule 3\n\nRespect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone\u2019s personal or confidential information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their consent.\n\nRule 4\n\nDo not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.\n\nRule 5\n\nYou don\u2019t have to use your real name to use Reddit, but don\u2019t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.\n\nRule 6\n\nEnsure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.\n\nRule 7\n\nKeep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.\n\nRule 8\n\nDon\u2019t break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of Reddit.",
