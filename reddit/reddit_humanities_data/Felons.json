[https://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/50-state-comparisonjudicial-expungement-sealing-and-set-aside-2-2/](https://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/50-state-comparisonjudicial-expungement-sealing-and-set-aside-2-2/) is a great resource for information. States vary wildly, from not offering expungements at all like in I believe South Carolina to states like California that automatically expunge all convictions after a set period of time.\n\nThat's the European model. All crimes except for the absolute worst have a certain time period where they're basically forgotten and you regain all of your rights.\n\nThat particular website gives a list of expungement laws, voting rights laws, and firearm rights laws. Many states have a simple waiting period, while others require a petition or a pardon on the state level.\n\nI would like to see more information about felons moving aboard and how they're treated. I know a lot of countries simply don't share information with the west, their criminal justice systems are more refined, or they simply don't care. I don't believe much of Latin or South America cares from what I've read before, but I could be mistaken.\n\nI saw a post on here that keeps getting downvoted that has some great information in it about regaining rights after an accusation. It talks about reputation damage control with changing your name and stuff like that. People just flooded it with downvotes and troll speak, though. It's filled with LE troll accounts as well. Check their post history and it's all r/letalk and stuff.\n\nThey don't want you to have rights or be an equal citizen. I propose we all seek a legal education and fight for our rights. I have been accused of a lot of crimes and almost got convicted with the affidavits stating I didn't even commit them. None of the crimes I've reported have ever been investigated, either. I'll try to get a list of education resources together for felons as well. As far as I know, the ONLY thing preventing a felon from getting federal student aid is a drug trafficking conviction. It's strange it's that since, at least according to FBI statistics, that's the #1 crime committed by incarcerated military service members and police. It's like 25% of all convictions for them.",

A lot of these applications like school district ask if I got any criminal conviction at all. I answer yes because it will show up on a background check. The reason I got this violent misdemeanor was because I was released from the hospital and wasn't put on proper medication. I have schizophrenia and I hallucinate very badly when not properly medicated. I thought I was in a danger of dying and thought my father was zodiac. I ended up hurting him very badly. I got lucky that I didn't kill him and got thrown in jail.\n\nI plea down from a felony to a misdemeanor. Its  been one year and two months since the incident. I've been taking care of my ill dad he is 80 years old. I've graduated from college last May been applying since April and I can't get an IT job. I was sorry for hurting my dad and he forgave me. I've been taking care of him since and just want to go back to a normal life. I feel like I can't with this misdemeanor and I heard it can't get expunged because it was a violent nature. I don't want give up on I.T but I am at the point where I might just have to settle for any low wage jobs. My dad doesn't want me to settle for a low wage job and prefer I get a job with computers. I know I got lucky and didn't spend a long time in prison, but at the same time I want to move forward with my life.\n\nTLDR: Mental illness caused me to be violent and hurt someone very badly.

You also get access to Columbia's alumni and there are a lot of mentors that work one on one with students.

The opportunity to apply for this year's acceptance is closing shortly.\n\nIf it is something you are interested, I would be happy to dm you the info.  The process is you fill out a quick app, attend a live Zoom MTG about the program and then record 3 interview questions and take a multi choice computer quiz."

There were drops basically everyday. \n\nOne of the spots was in a dumpster that everyone with a job would pass going to the shops or main yard every morning. Basically a 100+ yard walk from our yard to the main yard without direct line of sight. One guard at the gate to let people out, a staff member would walk the group(s) to work and then another guard would check them in. There was no guarded gate onto the property and you could actually drive right up to the minimum yard in a personal vehicle and only be seen if the one guard at the main yard was looking the right way. At night (no yard movement) there were no guards at the main yard posted looking in the direction of the minimum yard.  \n\nOne guy got his \"girl\" to make a drop one night. 5lbs of tobacco, 5lbs of weed, 3 cellphones. She was supposed to put it in the dumpster and he'd arrange to have it picked up the next morning. \n\nNo idea on the specifics of why the guards were on alert that night, but they were. She pulled up with 2 kids in the car (16 & 13 M) and gave the package to the 16 y/o who took it and placed it in the dumpster. Then they were surrounded by county deputies and COs.  16 y/o got arrested, Mom got arrested & 13 y/o was taken by DFS then given to relatives. \n\nNever heard the resolution of everything but initially the 16 y/o caught 3 charges & Mom caught 2.
