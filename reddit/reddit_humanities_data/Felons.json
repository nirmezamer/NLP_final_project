A lot of these applications like school district ask if I got any criminal conviction at all. I answer yes because it will show up on a background check. The reason I got this violent misdemeanor was because I was released from the hospital and wasn't put on proper medication. I have schizophrenia and I hallucinate very badly when not properly medicated. I thought I was in a danger of dying and thought my father was zodiac. I ended up hurting him very badly. I got lucky that I didn't kill him and got thrown in jail.\n\nI plea down from a felony to a misdemeanor. Its  been one year and two months since the incident. I've been taking care of my ill dad he is 80 years old. I've graduated from college last May been applying since April and I can't get an IT job. I was sorry for hurting my dad and he forgave me. I've been taking care of him since and just want to go back to a normal life. I feel like I can't with this misdemeanor and I heard it can't get expunged because it was a violent nature. I don't want give up on I.T but I am at the point where I might just have to settle for any low wage jobs. My dad doesn't want me to settle for a low wage job and prefer I get a job with computers. I know I got lucky and didn't spend a long time in prison, but at the same time I want to move forward with my life.\n\nTLDR: Mental illness caused me to be violent and hurt someone very badly.
