            "Tried to play more jinx this season and quit for this exact reason. She\u2019s so hard to play without peel/into dive comps. A lot of hyper carries just can\u2019t handle being dove/jumped on by champions with insane target access. Playing Jinx into Camille-Zac-Zed-ADC-Pyke is a nightmare",
            "Kog mas cant be played without peal support. Jinx can but its hard. Twitch is easiest to play hyper carry without peal support",
            "I'm not an ADC main but I do play alot of support, I started off as karma but I started playing supp during a season when literally everyone would pick lee sin and there would be alot of assassin mid laners, ended up maining poppy support with exhaust and the amount of peel she has is crazy.\n\nThe best way would be to ask if the person playing support has any engage or tank supports because alot of times I'll play an enchanter because there's only so much brand/zyra/duo mage bots I can take before I get tired of being a damage sponge for ADCs who are too timid to go in.",
            "if your support picks a mage support just pick jhin lmao you pretty much become their support during laning phase, cringe but wins games.",
            "Hypercarries like jinx straight up don\u2018t work then.\n\nIt\u2018s the main reason i\u2018ve stopped blind picking Jonx and when YoloQing and I want scaling I just pick zeri.\n\nShe works with kinda whatever support since I jist want to farm in lane and if my jgl comes it\u2018s a nice bonus. \n\nAlso with her kiting and terrain passing she can deal with little peel a bit better",

            "With kog maw I wait for the enemies to engage and then I join the fight.\n\nI always think what can cc me and who can jump on me and once I see their ability used in the engage I feel more confident going in. Otherwise I'll dps how much I can from far away.",

            "The biggest failure of a crit item, it doesnt even work on champ that could abuse it the most a. k. a Samira R. Never seen anyone buy it above plat elo, I feel like the only purpose that it had was to make clickbait youtube videos, i\u2019ll take 800 shield from shieldbow in 99% of games other that useless crit burn extra damage that noone needs anyway since 5 items ADC overkills anyone except tanks with randuin",
            "It can be good when you need more damage as 3rd or 4th item, but in realistic scenario you're usually buying more defensive items, like shieldbow or bt, because you need to survive. Yuntal has it's cases and it's fine in terms of power, just not a necessary item in most games.",
            "Its synergy with Runaans is pretty decent. Other than that, the item is extremely underwhelming, but i still buy it every once in a while as there are very few non attack speed crit items and there isnt really anything else to get",
            "Honestly I like its concept a lot, giving some extra DoT on autos gives Crit ADCs a slightly anti-tank skewed item that isn\u2019t game-breaking or usable by other classes. The fact that it\u2019s high base AD and crit just means you don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to buy it just to kill tanks\u2014if you want crit and don\u2019t want attack speed, it\u2019s the perfect last crit item imo.\n\nTypically, anti-tank is on-hit/attack speed based or just your single pen item, but a lot of champions can\u2019t build on-hit without sacrificing too much in the way of crit. To be fair, I do only think it\u2019s a 4th/5th item at best, but if it kept its passive and was strong enough to be picked up 1st or 2nd, it\u2019d be too strong. I think it\u2019s good where it\u2019s at, but would probably give it a 5 AD buff that way it isn\u2019t 15 AD less than BT.",
            "If you didnt buy collector as first item its pointless to buy it later in the game, so you dont have much choices and you buy best item from bad item pool, what else to buy shieldbow xD>?",

            "It's only useful if you're up against like triple tank or something to that effect, where the bleed actually has time to work.",
            "It really is just the biggest pile of trash. IE 15 more AD for just 200 gold more. if it wants to be 'second IE' it has to actually do that job.\n\nAlso half the people in this thread are morons who don't even understand that the item is functionally just Worse IE because the DoT warps their brains into thinking it's some kind of weird on-hit item or that 'stacking' the bleed achieves some extra effect (it does not)"
