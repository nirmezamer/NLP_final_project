            "you follow your tank like a bitch and youre always the last player to enter a fight",
            "Tried to play more jinx this season and quit for this exact reason. She\u2019s so hard to play without peel/into dive comps. A lot of hyper carries just can\u2019t handle being dove/jumped on by champions with insane target access. Playing Jinx into Camille-Zac-Zed-ADC-Pyke is a nightmare",
            "You don't. Just pick hypercarries with a peel sup, it's better for your sanity.",
            "High elo jinx otp here. When you have 0 peel in teamfights, flash is your most valuable tool. You have to use it for something important everytime (j4 ult for example)and not waste it for a kill(unless you get a reset). Also, after lvl 9 you almost always use rockets, unless someone is directly into your face. Positioning is everything, and use ue E between you and enemies for zoning(like a wall). Also at high lvls your W slows alot(more like a stun almost) and is on low cd, so spam it as much as you can.",
            "Play like a complete bitch, and only go in once every ability that can be used to catch you out of position of one shot you has been used. You have a lot of range as Jinx or Kogmaw so you should be behind absolutely everything just shooting rockets or purple spit.",
            "hide in the brush, enter the fight late, get flamed by your team. /muteall before or after whichever you prefer.",
            "im 99% certain that the only way is to be an absolute crackhead",
            "You dont. Or you hope to get 1 or 2 kills before the enemy team dives you. And hope youe team can clean up",
            "You could honestly space like a god and be the best in the world, but with zero peel nothing can stop a Vi flash R-Q stun locking you (there\u2019s various ways out of this combo after it has ended with stuff like Lulu R, assuming you somehow haven\u2019t been killed during it.) Some comps are easier to 1v9 against with pure spacing but the game has so much burst engage that it feels near impossible to do this consistently. Now factor in that we\u2019re *not* the best players in the world and it becomes even harder lol.",
            "You arent really able to. I played as Jinx vs Alistar, J4, Panth and Syndra yesterday. Was a nightmare without peel. I had 20 kills because we hardstomped the lane but even as a hardcore fed Jinx, I had a hard time in teamfights because I either needed to flash or wait till they used absolutey everything"
