I love modern aircraft and I'm particularly interested in seeing an F-22 Raptor up close. Are there any air shows or public events during these months where I might have the chance to see one?\n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate any recommendations for museums that focus on aviation history and modern aircraft.\n\nI've heard about public military bases, but I'm not sure if this information is accurate. I would like to find out the truth about this. Also, is there any chance to see an aircraft carrier during my visit?",
