When I first saw this, I thought the thing on the TV looked so familiar. It appears to be three people getting food at a buffet, probably from sometime in the 2000s. It's hard to see their faces, as the TV is cut off, but I initially thought the blonde woman looked like Sarah Jessica Parker and this could be a scene from Sex and the City, but I haven't found a scene that matches. There are also no results when you reverse image search it.\n\nThere are two other pictures from this day where you can see the TV in the background, in one there is a football game on the TV and in the other there is a McDonald's commercial, which weren't much of a help. It also doesn't help that there is no clear indicator of what channel this was on.\n\nHoping someone recognizes this!",

The girlfriend had blonde hair, and the boyfriend had black hair, I'm pretty sure. They had a really popular video where the blonde girl pranked her boyfriend with a fake home invasion. She pretended to be dying, put blood all over the floor, and threw shoe racks at the door to make it look like a break-in when the boyfriend came home. I remember a video where the boyfriend gave her a huge bouquet of roses and another video where he gave her candy that wasn't vegan (I think the candy might have looked like little pigs or something). They ended up breaking up, but if it helps, they got a kitten or cat at some point, maybe before breaking up. They were American, not married, and had no kids. If you find this channel, I will love you forever, and my inner child will be healed.",
