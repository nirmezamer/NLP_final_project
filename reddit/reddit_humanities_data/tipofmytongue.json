So after no luck researching it, I came here. All I really remember from it was like it started with a girl who worked for like the police or was like a detective? Either way she had to travel to another country to solve a murder that she believed was the result of demonic possession, but her boss thought she was crazy. I don't remember the exact country but it was probs smth like Scotland or some European country. She gets there and she meets like a priest guy and eventually falls in love with him even though she's not religious herself, and then she starts... Uhhhh having \"fantasies\" and VIVID dreams of said priest guy, like I remember there being multiple sex scenes. And then I remember there being a scene where her car breaks down and she has to call him. And then at the end she went to like a barn kinda thing for some reason and she got possessed but priest guy like did an exorcism and saved her and.. the end. Thats all I remember I am very sorry for the lack of details </3",
