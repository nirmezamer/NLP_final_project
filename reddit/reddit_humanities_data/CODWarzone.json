When i watch clips of peoples AA its like soft aimbot. When i play my aim assist is like a gentle suggestion rather than snapping to people and staying there. Why am i a worse average aimer in a game that requires less aim skill? What am i doing wrong? Ive defended AA for a while because of my own experiences with it but i cant ignore weight of evidence. How to activate the god aim?\n\nEdit i play on and xbox one and a 2016 32 inch tv \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f dunno if that makes a difference, heard people saying it does.",
