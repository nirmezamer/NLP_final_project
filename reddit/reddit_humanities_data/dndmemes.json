Not Safe For Wednesdays will commence Midnight PST for 24 Hours and happen every week as long as things go well. The rules for NSFW\u2019s will be more or less the same with some differences:\n\n1) NSFW posts must be marked with the Not Safe For Wednesdays and NSFW Flairs. \n\n2) Must be a Meme/Comic, not just a pic with no text and a headline. There\u2019s other subreddits to show your Team Scales or Team Goblin love. \n\n3) Posting outside the time window will result in it being declined. \n\n4) Posters who habitually break the TOS and rules for NSFW\u2019s will be banned. \n\nIf there are any suggestions or feedback, leave a comment. We will be opening a new round of Mod Applications in the coming weeks. More to follow. Thank you all for your patience. Hope the rest of your week is full of NAT 20\u2019s.",

Now One D&D.  Yeah, they have it in for the Ranger.",
