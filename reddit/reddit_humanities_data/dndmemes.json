Not Safe For Wednesdays will commence Midnight PST for 24 Hours and happen every week as long as things go well. The rules for NSFW\u2019s will be more or less the same with some differences:\n\n1) NSFW posts must be marked with the Not Safe For Wednesdays and NSFW Flairs. \n\n2) Must be a Meme/Comic, not just a pic with no text and a headline. There\u2019s other subreddits to show your Team Scales or Team Goblin love. \n\n3) Posting outside the time window will result in it being declined. \n\n4) Posters who habitually break the TOS and rules for NSFW\u2019s will be banned. \n\nIf there are any suggestions or feedback, leave a comment. We will be opening a new round of Mod Applications in the coming weeks. More to follow. Thank you all for your patience. Hope the rest of your week is full of NAT 20\u2019s.",

The argument made with your meme basically just says \"You as a DM can homebrew that Necromancers aren't evil, or ask your DM to homebrew it if you're a player\". \nYou also said \"no one can force you to abide the official lore\" yes - fun fact people run games they call \"homebrew\".\n\nSpeaking of homebrew, couldn't that be said to literally every argument posted on DnD? Just apply homebrew!\n\nThe argument tends to pertain to \"Is it [blank] while pertaining to the rules\". Everyone knows you can homebrew things via DM. That's never been what the argument has been. The argument is always pertaining to official lore.\n\nIt's like if there is an argument of \"Is Bowser always the bad guy?\" and you reply \"No I just played this third party game where he isn't that's heavily modded! So he isn't always the bad guy:)\".\n\nYou should have listed in Yugi's side something actually countering, for example what another commenter said that retains to the Necromancer stat block.\"A few use their powers for good, becoming hunters of the undead and risking their lives to save others.\" As that actually pertains to the argument people have, that even in official lore, not all Necromancers are considered evil.",

            "The act itself might be evil but the character itself can still be good. Both the necromancer and the dead they animate.\n\nBut because the act itself is evil, it usually takes an individual of great willpower to not be tempted by the evil.\n\nMost important of all though: Good and Evil in D&D are **not** just moral concepts, they are *tangible forces* in the universe. Like law and chaos, they hold power over multiverse.\n\nSo the way I see it is this: Good characters can use necromancy, but doing so is far more taxing than an evil character doing so, because the act itself is evil. Same with evil characters casting good-aligned spells. Furthermore, using such spells in places steeped in the energies of good/evil ease/tax the process even more. Why do necromancers always appear in haunted places and graveyards? Because the places are steeped in evil energies and make it easier to raise the dead. Same with rituals - infusion of an area with the desired energies.\n\nThe moral side comes when the character has to make a decision: Some spells might be impossible for them to cast if they are too far down that path they are on until they either grow stronger or steer from the path. Do they change their moral outlook and thus their alignment to make things easier for themselves or do they keep going?"

Jeremy mentioned it an hour while Chris corrects him and says his preview book has a different duration, and I highly doubt they\u2019d have increased the duration. \n\nTo pretend the changes are all positive is a disingenuous argument.
