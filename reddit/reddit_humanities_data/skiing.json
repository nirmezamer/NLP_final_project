The original plan was to hit it in 2025, but I had a stroke of luck and I hit my $$ goals early to take the vacation this year. I've got a week off in two weeks, and I'm heavily debating sending it this year instead. \n\n  \nMy question is this, has anyone been at Portillo yet this year? How were conditions?  I saw on their social media that they got slammed recently, but the temps have been above freezing in the day pretty consistently. Wondering if it's worth the investment now or to try my luck next year.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "It seems like the Sellaronda Orange ski loop is an easy way to see the sites of the Dolomites. I've heard a lot of YouTubers say the route is well marked and easy to follow. Is there a good town to stay in that has some lifts within walking distance that are a good part to start the Sellaronda Orange loop?\n\nI have also heard some excellent things about Cortina d'Ampezzo. But I feel like I should just keep it simple and stick to Sellaronda, unless there is a big reason to stay in Cortina instead. It also seems to be closer to Venice Italy where I am flying into from Boston Massachusetts.\n\nLastly, I was just curious if there are any tree runs in the Dolomites? I could be totally wrong, but it seems like everything is very marked off groomed trails. How is the off trail environment?\n\nBackground: Advanced skier from Vermont with an Ikon Pass that has the Dolomites on it. Thinking of flying to Venice Italy, experiencing there for 3 days, then going up to the Dolomites for 4 days, then take an extra day to go back to Venice to fly home. I've traveled around the United States before, but I have never been out of the country. Apres stuff is awesome, but my main goal is just to ski the Dolomites for the first time. I am thinking of renting a car for this trip, unless there is a good train / bus system I can find. Thank you so much for any help.",

            "Its interconnected so it doesnt matter where you stay. No tree runs (tree line in the Alps is low), groomed terrain only or freeride if you have the knowledge (we dont do avalanche control, only reports). Cortina has bad access to Sellaronda. Reason to stay there is to spend more money and have a Drei Zinnen view (where I would argue Langkofel and Sellaturme are equally impressive).",
            "I would go to Campitello or Canazei  (Val di Fassa) and start from there  you can do the all Dolomiti Superski round (either direction) from there  I have been going there since I was 2 and Im 47 now. Val Di Fassa is cheaper than Cortina",
            "Either direction of the Sellaronda is an easy way to see the Dolomites, both are very well marked. Multiple towns are walking distance to the Sellaronda: Val Gardena, Colfosco, Corvara, Arabba, Alba, Canazei, and Campitello di Fassa (the last three will require a cable car ride to start and end the day).\n\nI did the Sellaronda Green and it was great. One drawback to the Green loop is that it just goes through Arabba, it does not take one of the big lifts up to Porta Vescovo. I knew I was coming back to ski Arabba and the Marmolada Glacier the next day so not a big deal. If I were to do the  Sellaronda Green again I would ride Lift #1 and do a run (or three) and then continue.\n\nTree skiing? Nope, all groomed piste skiing with mostly man made snow. Surface will be hard, bring or rent some carving skis!\n\nI rented a car and was glad I did. There are some busses but the schedules are erratic, dont think there is any train service. I stayed in Selva Wolkenstein (Val Gardena) and drove to Arraba and Cortina for ski days. Cortina was great fun,  not very big so one day was perfect.",
            "Some tree skiing in the beautiful val gardena area. \n\nI'd also recommend the hidden valley that you get to by a taxi from Corvara to Lagazuoi. The cable car ride up is covered in your ticket. Watch your timing coming back, they close the link tows around 1630 but there are always taxis! \n\nhttps://inspireditaly.com/travellers-tales/dolomites-best-ski-runs-hidden-valley/"

I\u2019ve been looking at instructing but that\u2019s not too sustainable from what I\u2019ve heard, although I still want to get the qualification I\u2019ll obviously need more jobs to go with it and perhaps something a little higher paying.
