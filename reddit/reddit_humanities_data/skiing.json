            "Hi everyone! \n\nI am looking for helmet recommendations for a low profile helmet to fit my rather large head, 1-3 xl depending on brand. I will find a way to get the dimensions of my skull soon.\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit difficult to deal with such a big helmet when clipped onto my back pack, doesn\u2019t fit in helmet parachutes on the back of said bag, can\u2019t fit jacket hood over etc. What brands make low profile helmets ideally also with mips? \n\nThanks in advance."

I\u2019m planning a girls ski trip in Europe in February and would love to hear resort/ location recommendations from the community. \n\nBackground:\n\u2022 group of three - mid 30s\n\u2022 beginners \n\u2022 about three to four nights \n\u2022 reasonably priced accommodations: ~\u20ac200/ night per person \n\u2022 looking for good skiing and apr\u00e8s ski (not huge partiers though; more sophisticated crowd preferred)\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "Others may provide suggestions on resorts/locations. \n\nIf you could re-schedule a bit, you may avoid the crowds and the high prices that will be inevitable mid-end February. That is the period in which a number of European countries have their school holidays. End of January, first week of February would be a much better choice, or after mid-March.",
            "well first of all, if next winter will be anything like the 2024 one, don\u2019t even look at anything below 1800m\u2026 there was no snow at all \ud83d\ude22 If you have the \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac, Alpe d\u2019Huez is great: lots of slopes for every level, very well maintained and a fair amount of activities off the slopes so you never get bored. Cons: not the cheapest of places\u2026",
            "For Apres, Austria. Avoid crowds and go late March or early Jan. Look at Kitzb\u00fchel or Ischgl.\n\nBtw what you call reasonable price is a ripoff, 100 a night is already pretty good budget for most places unless you go high season which you\u2019d suffer through as a beginner due to overcrowding",
