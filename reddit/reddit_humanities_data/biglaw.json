        "content": "**UPDATES**: The layoff tracker has been updated - you can see health and severance package details.  Please note - if you want to filter, sort or search, it needs to be viewed on desktop.  For those of you who were impacted, please reach out (there are two law firms who contacted us and say they're hiring.  We're just verifying some info with them to get a better sense of the opportunity) \n\n**LAUNCHED**: Please check out [lawlayoffs.com](https://lawlayoffs.com) (best viewed on desktop for now) - it is a work in progress, but you can see the submissions from today.  Please share widely and submit any intel you have on layoffs.  Even for the widely known cases, it helps to get information about health, severance and comp packages (hopefully this creates a gap between those who treat their associates well on the way out versus those who ruthlessly axe budding associates' careers).\n\n**UPDATE**:  Here is the link for anon submissions: [https://airtable.com/shrxA7A8A0wBa7RlY](https://airtable.com/shrxA7A8A0wBa7RlY).  We have White & Case, Mintz Levin, Moritt Hock & Hamroff so far.  Please keep them coming. Even for these firms, it's likely the case that people in one office don't know what's happening in another, so please submit if you're aware of anything.\n\n\\----------Original post:\n\nI'm building a comprehensive layoff tracker for law firms that relies on input from anons, but is filtered so offensive sh\\*t isn't posted for everyone to see.  I would love people's input.\n\nTo start, we'll be documenting:\n\n* Firm Name\n* Layoff Announce Date\n* Office(s)\n* Number of People Laid Off\n* Source\n\nPlease let me know in comments if you think we should capture/ask for any other types of info.\n\nThe plan right now is to put it on a website that doesn't require you to provide any personal emails to access while still maintaining basic security measures (difficult on google spreadsheets, so looking at one good alternative).",

While I feel everything was fine in the beginning, the longer I stay in my practice group the more I realize how much I am being unabashedly ostracized socially. \n\nI get plenty of work, and generally receive very good feedback - but the partners seem to really adore one of the other associates who is my age, and while they do not seem to despise me and are friendly towards me, they clearly do not hold me in such high regard. \n\nI don't really have friends in the office, while this other associate is a social butterfly who is constantly receiving attention and hanging out with partners even out of the office - she literally does yoga with a partner and knows their children to the point of being give birthday cards by their children. There are regular work lunches to which I've never been invited - and many, many other examples I will not delve into here.\n\nI am not going to ever be able to compete with that. The pay is good and no one is particularly toxic, but this feeling of being out of the \"magic bubble\" is crushing - no one states that but I know I'll be thrown out of the bus in a second if the choice is between me and this other associate.\n\nShould I just cut my losses and lateral/ move teams? I feel like the longer I wait, the more I am actually losing precious time to go to a place where I'll actually be able to build rapport with partners who will appreciate me and have my back for real.

            "What are your goals? If theyre not to make partner, your situation seems totally fine until you decide to make a jump. Just be a professional. \n\nIf you want to make partner, is this other associates work actually good? Is the other associate intent on making partner? Some people are beloved and go in-house anyway because thats what they want.",
            "The partner is definitely recommending the other associate for partnership over you, but it doesn't mean she hates you.",
            "Yeah that is weirdly close relationship. Abnormally so. Dont try and compete with that but also dont use it as the benchmark you should be meeting.",
            "Every situation is different but odds are that you are over thinking it and everything is fine. there's probably also some things you could do to proactively improve the situation a bit. so i'd say take it in stride and see what you can do to make things better if work is otherwise going well.",
            "We had someone start at my firm and while she wasn't conventionally attractive, she instantly sparked romantic interest from three partners.  They staffed her on their trials, almost got into fights with each other over who would walk her home from evening events, etc.  She eventually married one of them.  I still can't explain it.\n\nAs long as you're not interested in THAT kind of attention, I would rather be in your position than the other associate's.",
            "It's work, not a social club. The other associate's very close relationship is not the norm. Sometimes people just click perfectly, it's a rare thing, and that it seems to have happened to this other associate and not you is not a cause for concern. If you like the work and people are professional towards you, no reason to leave.",
            "Idk if it actually matters or not career-wise, but just know that it doesn't reflect on your likeability at all to be ostracized by the most socially stunted people on earth (lawyers). I dread going to bar events now that I work in law-adjacent and am used to communicating with normal, healthy educated and well-rounded people.",

Dont look at your title and then get upset when someone you consider a peer is promoted past you.  You cant control anyone elses career but you can control (somewhat) yours.  Being in management, I can say its never just as easy as this person deserves it, sadly.   Id promote all my people every year if I canbut I cant.  Just not within the budget constraints we live in.\n\nBut I know its easy to say dont compare yourself to others, but really hard to control those feelings, especially when youre pretty young in your career.",
            "I'd like to make partner but I don't see myself groveling for years if the situation is too dire. I think I could wait it out until it's the right time to leave, but I don't know if I am making this choice because I feel I can't compete, you know?"
