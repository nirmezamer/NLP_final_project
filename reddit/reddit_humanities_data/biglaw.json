        "content": "**UPDATES**: The layoff tracker has been updated - you can see health and severance package details.  Please note - if you want to filter, sort or search, it needs to be viewed on desktop.  For those of you who were impacted, please reach out (there are two law firms who contacted us and say they're hiring.  We're just verifying some info with them to get a better sense of the opportunity) \n\n**LAUNCHED**: Please check out [lawlayoffs.com](https://lawlayoffs.com) (best viewed on desktop for now) - it is a work in progress, but you can see the submissions from today.  Please share widely and submit any intel you have on layoffs.  Even for the widely known cases, it helps to get information about health, severance and comp packages (hopefully this creates a gap between those who treat their associates well on the way out versus those who ruthlessly axe budding associates' careers).\n\n**UPDATE**:  Here is the link for anon submissions: [https://airtable.com/shrxA7A8A0wBa7RlY](https://airtable.com/shrxA7A8A0wBa7RlY).  We have White & Case, Mintz Levin, Moritt Hock & Hamroff so far.  Please keep them coming. Even for these firms, it's likely the case that people in one office don't know what's happening in another, so please submit if you're aware of anything.\n\n\\----------Original post:\n\nI'm building a comprehensive layoff tracker for law firms that relies on input from anons, but is filtered so offensive sh\\*t isn't posted for everyone to see.  I would love people's input.\n\nTo start, we'll be documenting:\n\n* Firm Name\n* Layoff Announce Date\n* Office(s)\n* Number of People Laid Off\n* Source\n\nPlease let me know in comments if you think we should capture/ask for any other types of info.\n\nThe plan right now is to put it on a website that doesn't require you to provide any personal emails to access while still maintaining basic security measures (difficult on google spreadsheets, so looking at one good alternative).",

I personally know of MANY excellent attorneys who had great reviews, had zero performance issues, were committed - but ended up being laid off once upon a time; the vast majority of them are now thriving.  Hang in there and don't give up.\n\nUPDATE: Just launched [lawlayoffs.com](https://lawlayoffs.com). Would like to include something there for laid off attorneys and staff - feel free to let us know of any suggestions.",

I was always under the impression that most of these firms, especially in Boston, are relatively equal regarding how demanding the hours are, but now people are coming out of the woodwork about how horrible of a place it is.

            "DPW or S&C or Skadden (NYC lit) - tried to post on top-law-schools but it did not get approved and this is a time-sensitive decision for me. \n\nI've liked DPW the best so far, for both the \"culture\" and the way work is assigned in their lit practice (generalist model for 3 years before settling down, centralized staffing). It's also the only firm whose office I have visited on this list. However, I'm apprehensive about it being Band 2 in general commercial lit (albeit being Band 1 in WC and securities lit). \n\nA lot of people say S&C is more \"prestigious\" - is that true? I really like their generalist model as well. Centralized staffing is also important to me. It is ranked Band 1 in general commercial lit, WC, and securities lit. I have heard bad things about the culture but am unsure how true they are. \n\nI do not like Skadden's placement system - I am unsure what type of litigation I want to do so I would like some time to figure that out. Ranked Band 1 in general commercial lit, WC, and securities lit. However, the social aspects are a strong sell as someone moving to NYC and worried about making friends. \n\nI really hoped I would get a gut feeling about which firm was for me during the interviews but I pretty much really enjoyed all of these interviews the same - if anyone has any tips on choosing please let me know! Much appreciated.",
            "I slowed down on applications because I got an offer from a V60ish, but am realizing after getting a callback from a V10 that I'm probably more competitive than I thought. Top 20 percent at a strong top 50 school. Approaching offer deadline for V60 firm. Should I just go long on myself, let my v60 offer expire, see what happens at callback, and more thoroughly apply to the V20 firms?  Even if I strike out will there still be spots at OCI? Are the summer classes already filling up?"

We tell her we\u2019ll see her in the morning but she can call if she needs us. She eventually falls asleep. \n\nIf your kids still nap and are older toddlers, you might want to cut the nap.\n\nLike someone else said, I get 4-5 hours sleep per night tops because I try to be present for bedtime and mornings. Thankfully my husband handles the cooking.\n\nETA: we generally limit screens to 30 min/ day and turn them off at least one hour before bedtime.",

Enforcing the \u201ccrazy time\u201d vs \u201cquiet time\u201d has helped! \n\nI also try hard from 5-8pm bedtime to solely focus on him, because being at daycare all day he is just craving connection. That helps too.\n\nThat being said, my hours are absolutely trash and I\u2019m going to quit and get a new job.
