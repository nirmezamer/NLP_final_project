            "Make sure you do your research on crossfit.\n\nCrossfit got super popular when people started talking about how much faster it was to get stronger using it. \"Oh yeah mate, I couldn't do a single pullup, then I got into crossfit and now I can do 300!\"\n\nWhat they didn't tell you, was instead of steady controlled pullups. They were doing [crossfit pullups](https://i.imgur.com/Fc0tkuC.gif) which are significantly easier. It makes people feel great about themselves, but... you won't be growing muscles as fast (because you're not taxing them the same way if you were doing the exercises normally). There is some merit on the cardio side, but there is also higher risk of injury. When you could just be doing cardio normally and weight training normally.\n\nMy biggest problem is it's very techbro coded. You know how if you get a bunch of NFT bros in a room, they'll start NFT bro'ing? Crossfit bros are the same. Now that they do crossfit, everything in their lives is better and they're so excited to get everyone else into crossfit.\n\nDon't want to come across as too much of a hater, it's likely better than nothing. I just think it's very trendy like juice cleanses.",
            "I love Joey and I\u2019m so happy he is getting into fitness, truly one of the most satisfying journeys a person can take. I have my reservations about CrossFit but what matters most is that he is trying to be active(and he\u2019s enjoying himself). That alone already means he\u2019s doing more than most people. But I highly question his comment of being below 10% body fat without a proper diet.",
            "It was interesting to see them talking so candidly for the first 2 minutes while they didn't know they were being recorded. The voice tones and demeanors change so much once they know they have to be in content mode haha.",
            "GYYYYYM \ud83d\udcaa\n\nI've gone three times a week since two years ago, had a trainer for a year, have had many pointers about fixing my diet... and yet I haven't noticed any positive changes. \ud83d\ude2d I still think it's a better use of time than doomscrolling. The way I see it, the \"positive\" outcome is just that I haven't got any l*ess *healthy from sitting on my ass that whole time. I'd rather be bored burning calories than depressed on reddit.\n\nI still tell everyone to try going to the gym. Even if you just doomscroll on the treadmill (I prefer gacha games on the treadmill)",
            "My brother was a personal trainer and all that, crossfit absolutely ruins your joints it's too high impact.",
            "Recently started getting healthier and I experienced the same thing Joey did. Walking around with all my camera gear on a backpack will just destroy your back if you're not fit. Cut out all the junk food and shrunk my portion sizes to be the recommended portions while just using a stationary bike in my garage for 30 minutes a day. Went from around 200 to 165 in a few months.\n\nJoey's right, once you're without all the junk, you don't really crave it. Sure, I'd love a donut but it's no longer something I'd go out of my way to get and after one, I'm done.",
            "Same mentality as Connor, workout and get fit so you can eat all the delicious food of the world \ud83d\ude4c. Though this is not going to work for everyone.",
            "So Joey's going to be all set to join the next Cyclethon, right fellas?",
            "Good episode, genuinely would be surprised if Joey was sub 10 percent body fat.\u00a0 I know he\u2019s probably a lot fitter now then he was but that is a very low percentage considering he really doesn\u2019t look it \u00a0from his recent content\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Regardless huge ups for getting fit around 30. Hell ya dude !",
            "joey casually capping how his long jump record is 5m when the highest in recorded history is lil more than half that"

            "Betterhelp is a weird one. I saw a video by the channel therapist reacts (I think that was their name) where they rationalized why they still went with betterhelp as a sponsor. Some of the points they made were the complaints against betterhelp seemed to be largely somethings that happened years ago, due to poor management, and just the general business model being more loose on regulations compared to traditional. Anyway, I don't remember everything, but I think that channel, therapist reacts, made a decent enough argument in favor of keeping betterhelp as a sponsor. They could be lying or wrong, but frankly I don't see why as a viewer I need to do any further due diligence than this, especially about a sponsor I never plan to use and will just skip anyway. I don't see why as a viewer I need to hold trash taste accountable for this either, when I am not even sure the sponsor is evil.",

Betterhelp bad and they shouldn't have accepted the contract in the first place, but why are you assuming they can just exit? They would get sued to oblivion and Betterhelp have taken down videos criticising them before. This is pointless speculation.\u00a0",
