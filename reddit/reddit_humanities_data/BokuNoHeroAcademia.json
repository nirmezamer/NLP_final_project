            "\"Hey uraraka can we talk?\"\n\n\"Your new haircut sucks I'm sorry\"",
            "Finally Shoto says something!  \n  \nI liked his introspective thoughts on how AFO was born and came to power during chaotic times.  \n  \nIt seems that Deku both noticed how Uraraka and Shoto still have some emotional baggage from the war. Uraraka seems to be forcing herself to appear like her old cheerful self, while Shoto is probably ready to see his brother in that giant Bacta tank at the end.",

            "Can't see his face but Endeavor probably looks down as fuck seeing Toya like that.\n\nBut at least he's keeping an eye on him like he promised when he torched AFO."

            ">!Is the manga continuing or is it just a really long epilogue? Chapter 423 was definitely the end of the OFA/AFO fight but then 424 and 425 haven't really given an major closure aside from learning that Deku doesn't have OFA anymore. I'm just a bit confused whether this is ending or if Horikoshi is setting up to continue MHA.!<",
            "I\u2019m not a manga reader, but wtf dude is Deku just weak all the time until he gets serious? I know Toga is strong, I get that, but he in what appeared to be full cowling just allowed HER to drag him through a portal against his will?! What a chucklehead.",
            "Long epilogue, but this is the way to write a story. You have to tie up all loose ends, not just end it a chapter or two after beating the villain.",
            "Okay good to know! I'm totally down for a long epilogue and tying up loose ends for all the characters, I do hope Deku gets good closure because Chapter 242 just didn't do it for me during as closure. Thank you!",

            "Shoto\u2019s crying in the next week preview, I can\u2019t take it. This fight must\u2019ve hurt him on a very deep personal level. Dabi absolutely trashed Shoto with everything that he has, the voice actor did a perfect job portraying Dabi\u2019s hatred and jealousy toward his \u201cperfect replacement\u201d really well.\n\nI like how the anime expands more on Toya\u2019s mental breakdown. The kid got it rough even before he stir-fried himself into oblivion.\n\nAnd we still have Todoroki Family Epilogue next week, the timing is absolutely nuts.",
            "Dabi and Shoto's VAs totally killed it in this ep!!",

            "Dabi's backstory was done wonderfully, the whole atmosphere was done so well and it was even expanded. His emotions and devastation were palpable.\n\nThis was definitely the best animated episode so far. The fight itself had moments which I loved, especially Dabi's moves. But I gotta say I was a little underwhelmed with how Shoto's Glacial Aegir was animated, didnt look much like a ultimate move. It wasnt bad at all, but fell flat compared to the previous atacks. I think it needed a little more impact.\n\nStill definitely a very good episode especially on the emotional delivery. The voice actors were absolutely fantastic.\n\nVery curious how much they are adapting next episode, are they doing the whole endeavor fight or split it in two episodes. I think it would be best to do it all in one episode. And since a new poster for the episode was released to promote it I think that will be the case. A lot of the very strong animators werent used this episode either so I am also expecting them to appear either on the Endeavor or Bakugo episode. And both are great choices, although personally I would prefer Endeavor to have a little more love animation wise (I absolutely love his fight).",
            "The dabi vs todoroki fight ends in the anime and the closure for the todoroki family is happening in the epilogue chapters of the manga next week. Coincidence? \n\nI think NOT! lol but no I\u2019m actually being serious here am I crazy or what?\n\nAlso this Agni Kai was the best one since zuko vs azula! XD",

I know old people don't just like instantly die past a certain age but if he was AFO's age (I assume he was even older) he should just end up dying in a matter of seconds or at least when he was grabbed. Is this a limit of Erasure? Even if he doesn't just die from that, if he suffers from any serious damage does it go away after Erasure is deactivated?",

            "The thing about aging is that aging itself isnt what kills someone but rather that it makes one so frail and weak that anythings gets you and that accumulates over time\n\nWhat i think happens is that when the doctor gets hit with erasure his cells do age but he doesnt get all the diseases and problems acquired with aging, like he doesnt instantly gain dementia or lose controls of one bowels, as those are things that you accumulate through the aging process. And so he can last some time without any immediate issues until the ambient hits him with that common cold left right goodnight\n\nI could easily be wrong, im not a doctor lol.",

            "Your questions makes me imagine the doc having an immortality quirk but that\u2019s all it does. Or one that just lets him control his appearance. All the rest could be surgical. Transplanting newer organs, bone reinforcement, infusions of god knows what to keep the brain from deteriorating. I like the possibility of a lame immortality quirk that just won\u2019t let him die, while his body and mind wither in prison.",
            "Yeah i imagine its something like that\n\nHe does age and shrivels up, gets weaker and less capable but since Erasure wont last for long it ultimately wont bother him\n\nLike i am unsure what happens when he hits 150 or 200 but we dont even fully understand aging IRL either\n\nI imagine eventually it would get to the point where maybe he legit just collapses and cant breathe maybe? But idk.",

The writing is SO GOOD, it's honestly beautiful, and Horikoshi's biggest achievement was introducing Mirio then almost immediately making him the most compelling character in the entire manga.\n\nThis is why for all its flaws, and they are very real, for all of its serious pacing issues, for all of the issues with MHA, I can't just say \"Oh yeah the writing isn't that good\" or \"It's just a generic battle shonen\". When Horikoshi hit, he hit grand slams.",

I could get not being happybeithvth even in anime or something but being like \"I'll never forgive hirokoshi for this\" is crazy. Bonkers even",
