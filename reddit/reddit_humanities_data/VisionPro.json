I immediately began writing a 1000 word paragraph about how horrible of a person you are. I even sent a copy to a Harvard professor to proofread it. After several hours of refining and editing, my comment was ready to absolutely destroy you. But then, just as I was about to hit send, I saw something in the corner of my eye. A /s at the end of your comment. Suddenly everything made sense. Your comment was sarcasm! I immediately burst out in laughter at the comedic genius of your comment. The person next to me on the bus saw your comment and started crying from laughter too. Before long, there was an entire bus of people on the floor laughing at your incredible use of comedy. All of this was due to you adding /s to your post. Thank you.\n\nI am a bot if you couldn't figure that out, if I made a mistake, ignore it cause its not that fucking hard to ignore a comment",

This is a lot of hops to avoid just looking at one's wrist via pass through.  One layer could be removed/swapped out by using airplay from the phone directly to the \uf8ff Vision Pro or FaceTiming the iPhone but both those methods would take some interaction on the iPhone itself. \n\nWould be great if they just floated a mirrored  \uf8ff Watch screen directly over your watch when looking at  \uf8ff Watch much like the new floating control panel clock/battery widget when looking at back of hand gesture.  This could be larger and floating above the wrist and still be effective solution versus the four layer inception method. ",

        "content": "After avp received os 2, it significantly improved the quality of vr video and display in general.  But all the video platforms now (YouTube, deovr) and so on cannot offer the quality that would satisfy Apple's performance and displays.  The only and highest quality videos that will reveal the potential of vr today are, oddly enough: huge NSFW videos, 8K 60FPS videos, downloaded and launched in mono player.  Unfortunately, streaming 4k video in the browser is not worth the game.  But now Apple is creating new content with the help of its new cameras, I hope that this year we will see new tools for shooting, as well as rendering, perhaps an AI function will appear to improve the quality of any video on the fly and get rid of the gigantic sizes of uncompressed video.  So we will get VR videos that look like regular 4k 2d videos on YouTube.",

            "Immersive is flat out different than shooting typical film/video, from storyboards forward. The only content that will look good at 180 was content shot in and for 180.",
            "Frankly even the current 8K videos look like crap on AVP when done immersive 180\u00b0; forget about 360\u00b0. They look great flat; but once stretched to 180\u00b0 they lose sharpness. \n\nContent creators will figure it out but it\u2019s gonna take a long time.",
            "Here's a hot take: two streams of video will never be enough, no matter the resolution or frame rate. We want captures that are similar to the environments-- 3d geometry scanned, textured and animated in the foreground, then video to capture the background. That's the interesting step forward to me, 8k vs 6k vs Nk is still just a head-lock. I think people are underestimating how interesting the environments are-- esp as they are (slowly, slowly, ever so slowly) getting more complex and animated.",
            "This is 100% the correct answer. We aren't going to get truly immersive content until we create Volumetric media studios, lined with cameras, that will piece together the images in real time. These already exist but only in major experimental spaces, so it's just a matter of time for the creators to make it happen."
