            "Wish I saw this yesterday morning.  I was an AVP owner for about a week.\n\nPart of me absolutely loved the device.  It is a technological marvel, but for the cost it just is not worth for my use.  It would've been pretty much a very expensive web browser and streaming platform for movies, etc. \n\nBeyond that, while the lens inserts worked great, I felt like I had this giant pair of binoculars on me.  When I took it off after about 90 minutes of use (this happened several times over the six days I had it), it really took me some time to get re-oriented to real life.  My left eye in particular seemed to be out of focus for ten to fifteen minutes.\n\nI really think that the entertainment use is the secondary function of the AVP, commercial design use is really going to surprise people.",
