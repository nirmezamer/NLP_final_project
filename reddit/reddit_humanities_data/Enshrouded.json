Considering the devs are also looking in maybe revamping magic use I feel its only starting to spiral up.\n\nFingers crossed!",

Is it in a good state now, or should I wait? It's on sale for steam summer sale so I was thinking of getting it. \n\nThanks ",

            "Dunno how far into the cycle the game is. But holy shit is there a lot to do. Bought the game 3 days ago, and it's one of the best ea titles I've bought. The game is in a very good state I'd say, and knowing there's even more content to come makes it a really good deal.",
            "Combat is on the easy size outside of vaults.  Large world, fantastic building system, looks fantastic.  You can set up shop most anywhere, inclusion fixing up old ruins.  As long as changes are inside your base zone they stay.  The game isn't complete, you can't finish it, there are still zones to be added, there are balance issues between melee/archery/magic.  No base raids.  It's pretty chill.",
            "Out of your list i played the forest and valheim. The replayability is 100% better than the forest with better fighting mechanics, the forest is more like a storytelling survival game. Compared to valheim enshrouded is easier to play since you wont get raids, enemies are weaker, resources are easier to find, also I prefer the class based system in enshrouded. But valheim got more content at the moment since you can sail around and there are more areas to explore. If you play alone I would recommend enshrouded because the pace is right on for singleplayer, if you play with friends you might finish the game too quickly (within 50hrs I guess)\n\ntldr: Very solid game that is worth your money",
            "Fun and worth the money, but not endless playability as it does get boring after a short while.",
            "It's great, but at thr moment it's missing a lot of QoL Features and balancibg. You can also pick it up on a sale and wait for full release to play.",
            "It's solid but soulmask does it better.",
            "I bought it a few months ago and I was impressed with the polish and content. I don't want to play it until it gets 1.0 but I think it will be a fabulous game",
            "Enshrouded was a lot of fun, but Im waiting on my friends to get it so we can play. We just got sucked into Abiotic Factor and got so busy playing that that enshrouded took a back seat. The world is beautiful, puzzles are fun, combat is a little arcady I found myself jumping instead of rolling to dodge roll was on a weird button for me so it was one of the first things I changed, and your inventory on death though its not as important to grab will sometimes get stuck in unobtainable places so hopefully theyve changed that othe than the building is some of the best Ive had in a game very reminiscent of Minecraft the only limit is your imagination. Another note you slowly unlock flame shrines as you go, but always keep some on hand in case you come across a difficult area (in case you die) or something fun to explore because they work like fast travel points and can be a life saver when you are close discovering towers that will unlock a permanent fast travel point.",
            "Game is super fun. But my girl and I play in a group of 4. Both of us crash all the time now after putting in about 30 hours. Sadly unplayable in its current state for us.",
