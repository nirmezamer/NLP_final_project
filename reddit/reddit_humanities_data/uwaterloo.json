These offers often involve manually coding due to the complexity of the offer letters. Often, non-OSS students have more conditions that must be met. This may include providing official transcripts and test scores. For this reason, offers do not tend to appear all at once. We expect all early round admission offers to be indicated on\u00a0Quest\u00a0by the end of\u00a0Friday, March 15th\u201d. (Edited typo).",

It also contains some new columns. Now, a lot of this information is probably very old by now. Therefore **if you have any salaries to share or companies to add to the blacklist**, whether it is from a new company or one already on the sheet, please send me a chat message/PM, as it would greatly benefit from realistic numbers. If possible, please include the position, year, co-op term and any benefits you were given.\n\nThe sheet is here: [Salaries + Blacklist Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEDRTAalRsyD1iAO5fkp_8HUJUxbYTavotHhwX0AwBU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Average Canadian Co-op Earnings (2023)](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/about-co-op/co-op-earnings)\n\n[WaterlooWorks Important Dates](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/important-dates)\n\ngib even more job\n\nEDIT: In regards to the blacklist, I've realized that a single account probably can't justify adding a company, especially large ones with many teams. Thus, I will list blacklist candidates suggested by users below, and **I would encourage anyone who has also had negative experiences with companies on the candidates list to share them with me as well**. 2 complaints will usually be enough to add something with the exception of very large institutions.\n\nCandidates:\n\n* **Canadian Nuclear Laboratories**\n* **Baron Biosystems**\n* **Console One**\n* **LavaReach** (Added)",

            "This might not be your favourite option, but ask to defer your offer for a year. It means taking an extra year of high school (I did a victory lap, so very similar). It might give you the chance to retake calculus in high school with a much easier course load and then either do volunteer, parttime work or whatever else you want. Takes a ton of stress off and I know people who did it and really appreciated having that option",

I'm not sure if they'll even be able to/will extend it.\n\nI feel so lost. My dad is going to kick my ass. I feel like such a failure, I usually do so well.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm a bit emotional and feeling hopeless right now.\n\nI really appreciate the advice and will email them again, thank you.",

He is very strict and stern, and I just know he'll never let me out of his sight again. I know he will tell me I'd be failing my mother if she were still alive again. \n\nIt's the mental toll and fear of my father that needs me to get this done. I'm so scared of this being my only option. I'm already a disappointment to him, I can't imagine how much worse it will be.\n\nI'm sorry, that was a lot. I am struggling. \n\nThank you for the advice. Worst case scenario, I may have to do some sort of online school or something. I just hope I can get it done now, I need to.",

I know so many people who don\u2019t feel comfortable with that (people of other religions, atheists, ex-Muslims, etc.)\n\nIt\u2019s like if there was a public communion on campus - I would totally get if some students felt uncomfortable because they have had a bad experience with the Church and they have decided to move away from Christianity for a while. They wouldn\u2019t expect to see such a blatant act of worship while on campus. The UW campus should remain religion-free. Otherwise where does it end? If they want to do their public Islamic prayers does that mean other students should be free to do their satanic prayers in front of them? I hope this doesn\u2019t set precedent for other public religious activities. It\u2019s a really slippery slope that wouldn\u2019t end well for anyone.",

            "Ehhh, the reputation damage is BS. UW doesn\u2019t stand alone in having protests and it could be argued that this improved reputation to the right crowd.\n\nBut on to the prayer thing, wtf? Listen, I was raised in the Catholic church and my hard fought departure honestly put a divide between me and my parents even till today, so I think I can speak for having a bad experience with the church. And I really don\u2019t think public prayer is a problem. Handing out evangelist pamphlets peeves me and those anti-abortion freaks who post up on King St seriously piss me off, but prayer isn\u2019t a big deal. The university colleges are each associated with a sect of Christianity and I\u2019m almost certain some of their students have sat outside and prayed as a group before. It\u2019s maybe a little cringe I guess, but it\u2019s by no means offensive.",

            "I'd also like to point out that the case has nothing to do with the protest, specifically the claims have zero reference to the protest. This is specifically the illegal building of the encampment, and the unwillingness to comply with not only UW policy that has existed longer than these people have been students, but also Ontario, and Canadian laws revolving around private property and fire codes.",
