            "To everyone who is a F24 hopeful: Waterloo is great but it's not heaven. \n\nBe prepared for the longest, hardest, and most academically grueling 4-5 years of your life. Think about if that is something you are willing to put yourself through. I work with a guy who went to Western Eng and he can't remember all the parties he went to, while I can't remember all the times I cried in DC lmao.  \n\nThen remember....you won't be alone. There will be 100s of people just like you for you to lean on. \n\nGood luck!",

These offers often involve manually coding due to the complexity of the offer letters. Often, non-OSS students have more conditions that must be met. This may include providing official transcripts and test scores. For this reason, offers do not tend to appear all at once. We expect all early round admission offers to be indicated on\u00a0Quest\u00a0by the end of\u00a0Friday, March 15th\u201d. (Edited typo).",

It also contains some new columns. Now, a lot of this information is probably very old by now. Therefore **if you have any salaries to share or companies to add to the blacklist**, whether it is from a new company or one already on the sheet, please send me a chat message/PM, as it would greatly benefit from realistic numbers. If possible, please include the position, year, co-op term and any benefits you were given.\n\nThe sheet is here: [Salaries + Blacklist Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEDRTAalRsyD1iAO5fkp_8HUJUxbYTavotHhwX0AwBU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Average Canadian Co-op Earnings (2023)](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/about-co-op/co-op-earnings)\n\n[WaterlooWorks Important Dates](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/important-dates)\n\ngib even more job\n\nEDIT: In regards to the blacklist, I've realized that a single account probably can't justify adding a company, especially large ones with many teams. Thus, I will list blacklist candidates suggested by users below, and **I would encourage anyone who has also had negative experiences with companies on the candidates list to share them with me as well**. 2 complaints will usually be enough to add something with the exception of very large institutions.\n\nCandidates:\n\n* **Canadian Nuclear Laboratories**\n* **Baron Biosystems**\n* **Console One**\n* **LavaReach** (Added)",

            "From the claim:\n\nDirect Costs: Expenses for property repairs, security upgrades, and other safety measures to restore Campus operations and ensure community safety.\n\nOperational Disruptions: Cancellations and postponements of academic and commercial events, as well as delays in construction projects, leading to substantial economic losses and lost revenue opportunities.\n\nReputational Damage: Negative effect on the University's ability to, among other things, attract and retain students and faculty, secure funding, and maintain its academic and community standing.\n\nLegal and Administrative Costs: Expenses related to legal counsel and increased administrative efforts to manage disruptions and legal challenges.\n\nDiminished Property Values: Reduction in the market value of the University's\nproperty assets, affecting financial status and future investment potential. \n\nSome of these points are questionable but both parties agree it\u2019s more of a scare tactic to get the encampment to end sooner, rather than a way for the university to make dough.",
            "The details are all here - please read it for yourself lest you get tainted by the extreme perspectives of Reddit users\n\n[https://uwaterloo.ca/freedom-of-expression/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/statement-of-claim-university-of-waterloo-24-jun-202479.pdf](https://uwaterloo.ca/freedom-of-expression/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/statement-of-claim-university-of-waterloo-24-jun-202479.pdf)",
            "Other universities were quick to settle on agreeable terms and had their encampments packed up within the first/second week. \n\nIs somebody able to explain why this carried on for such a long period? Who is to blame\u2014the university or the protestors or both? \n\nI\u2019m sure this was the university\u2019s last card as obviously none of the protestors can afford this amount of money and the suit will make them quick to comply.",
            "Truely a \"fuck around and find out\" moment.",
            "Reading the entire document, it seems like the university did try to reach out many many times. The main person who seems to have taken a position of leadership, Ahmad, continually accepted, asked to change locations/dates last second including inside the encampment, and then either cancelled himself a day or 2 later, or the university couldn't change their plans last second or couldn't meet in the locations due to safety concerns.\n\nThe police wouldn't take down the encampment after being contacted by UW as even though it's clearly illegal, there's a process involving the need of a court order. By repeatedly making the encampment aware that university policy, and Ontario law were being violated, they've essentially covered their ass for the organizers to wiggle out of, which is really the only option you have to ensure there's a stop.\n\nAs someone with zero legal background, I don't think the entire payment will be made, the fact that there are people brought up who are unknown opens a lot of deals to reveal their identities to the court if this goes through, but I'm not sure how that stuff works out.",
            "I'd also like to point out that the case has nothing to do with the protest, specifically the claims have zero reference to the protest. This is specifically the illegal building of the encampment, and the unwillingness to comply with not only UW policy that has existed longer than these people have been students, but also Ontario, and Canadian laws revolving around private property and fire codes."
