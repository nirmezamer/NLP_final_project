Per our (very old) sub description:\n\n>This is a sub inspired by r/whowouldwin. There have been countless meta posts complaining about characters or explanations as to why X beats, and so on. So the purpose of this sub is to allow those who want to rant about a character or explain why X beats Y and so on.\n\nHowever, as early as 2015, we were already getting threads ranting about the quality of specific series, complaining about characterization, and just general shittery not all that related to \"who would win: 10 million bees vs 1 lion\".\n\nSo, per Post Rules 1 in the sidebar:\n\n>Thread Topics: You may talk about why you like or dislike a specific character, why you think a specific character is overestimated or underestimated. You may talk about and clear up any misconceptions you've seen about a specific character. You may talk about a fictional event that has happened, or a concept such as ki, chakra, or speedforce.\n\nWell that's certainly kinda vague isn't it?\n\n# So what can and can't be posted in CharacterRant?\n\n\u2705 **Allowed:**\n\n* **Battleboarding** in general (with two exceptions down below)\n* **Explanations**, **rants**, and **complaints** on, and about: characters, characterization, character development, a character's feats, plot points, fictional concepts, fictional events, tropes, inaccuracies in fiction, and the power scaling of a series.\n* **Non-fiction** content is fine as long as it's somehow relevant to the elements above, such as: analysis and explanations on wars, history and/or geopolitics; complaints on the perception of historical events by the general media or the average person; explanation on what nation would win what war or conflict.\n\n\u274c **Not allowed:**\n\n* he 2 Battleboarding exceptions: 1) hypothetical scenarios, as those belong in r/whowouldwin;2) pure calculations - you can post a \"fancalc\" on a feat or an event as long as you also bring forth a bare minimum amount of discussion accompanying it; no \"I calced this feat at 10 trillion gigajoules, thanks bye\" posts.\n* Explanations, rants and complaints on the technical aspect of production of content - e.g. complaints on how a movie literally looks too dark; the CGI on a TV show looks unfinished; a manga has too many lines; a book uses shitty quality paper; a comic book uses an incomprehensible font; a song has good guitars.\n* Politics that somehow don't relate to the elements listed in the \"Allowed\" section - e.g. this country's policies are bad, this government is good, this politician is dumb.\n* Entertainment topics that somehow don't relate to the elements listed in the \"Allowed\" section - e.g. this celebrity has bad opinions, this actor is a good/bad actor, this actor got cast for this movie, this writer has dumb takes on Twitter, social media is bad.\n\n# ADDENDUM -\n\n* *Politics in relation to a series and discussion of those politics is fine, however political discussion outside said series or how it relates to said series is a no, no baggins'*\n* *Overly broad takes on tropes and and genres? Henceforth not allowed. If you are to discuss the genre or trope you MUST have specifics for your rant to be focused on. (Specific Characters or specific stories)*\n* *Rants about Fandom or fans in general? Also being sent to the shadow realm, you are not discussing characters or anything relevant once more to the purpose of this sub*\n* *A friendly reminder that this sub is for rants about characters and series, things that have specificity to them and not broad and vague annoyances that you thought up in the shower.*\n\n**And our already established rules**:\n\n* No low effort threads.\n* No threads in response to topics from other threads, and avoid posting threads on currently over-posted topics - e.g. saw 2 rants about the same subject in the last 24 hours, avoid posting one more.\n* No threads solely to ask questions.\n* No unapproved meta posts. Ask mods first and we'll likely say yes.\n\n**PS**: We can't ban people or remove comments for being inoffensively dumb. Stop reporting opinions or people you disagree with as \"dumb\" or \"misinformation\".\n\n# Why was my thread removed? What counts as a Low Effort Thread?\n\n* If you posted something and it was removed, these are the two most likely options:\\*\\*\n* Your account is too new or inactive to bypass our filters\n* Your post was low effort\n\n**\"Low effort\"** is somewhat subjective, but you know it when you see it. Only a few sentences in the body, simply linking a picture/article/video, the post is just some stupid joke, etc. They aren't all that bad, and that's where it gets blurry. Maybe we felt your post was just a bit too short, or it didn't really \"say\" anything. If that's the case and you wish to argue your position, message us and we might change our minds and approve your post.\n\n# What counts as a Response thread or an over-posted topic? Why do we get megathreads?\n\n1. A **response thread** is pretty self explanatory. Does your thread only exist because someone else made a thread or a comment you want to respond to? Does your thread explicitly link to another thread, or say \"there was this recent rant that said X\"? These are response threads. Now obviously the Mod Team isn't saying that no one can ever talk about any other thread that's been posted here, just use common sense and give it a few days.\n2. Sometimes there are so many threads being posted here about the same subject that the Mod Team reserves the right to **temporarily restrict** said topic or a portion of it. This usually happens after a large series ends, or controversial material comes out (i.e The AOT ban after the penultimate chapter, or the Dragon Ball ban after years of bullshittery on every DB thread). Before any temporary ban happens, there will always be a **Megathread** on the subject explaining why it has been temporarily kiboshed and for roughly how long. Obviously there can be no threads posted outside the Megathread when a restriction is in place, and the Megathread stays open for discussions.\n\n# Reposts\n\n* A \"repost\" is when you make a thread with the same opinion, covering the exact same topic, of another rant that has been posted here by anyone, including yourself.\n* \u2705 It's allowed when the original post has less than 100 upvotes or has been archived (it's 6 months or older)\n* \u274c It's not allowed when the original post has more than 100 upvotes and hasn't been archived yet (posted less than 6 months ago)\n\n# Music\n\nUsers have been asking about it so we made it official.\n\nTo avoid us becoming a subreddit to discuss new songs and albums, which there are plenty of, we limit ourselves regarding music:\n\n* \u2705 **Allowed:** analyzing the storytelling aspect of the song/album, a character from the music, or the album's fictional themes and events.\n* \u274c **Not allowed:** analyzing the technical and sonical aspects of the song/album and/or the quality of the lyricism, of the singing or of the sound/production/instrumentals.\n\n**TL;DR**: you can post a lot of stuff but try posting good rants please\n\n*-Yours truly, the beautiful mod team*",

We're all thinking it. \n\nThat's why I've gathered some nice memes for you guys to copy-paste into the comments and be quickly done with it, if you so wish:\n\n*^(\"OP, what a post this is. I promise I won\u2019t let this rant go to waste.\")*\n\n*^(\"No I don't want that! AoT rant on this sub?! I want AoT to be rantless for the rest of my life! even after I die I still want AoT to be rantless for a while ! ten years at least !\")*\n\n*^(\"Only Ymir nose\")*\n\n*^(\"OP, was in love with AOT\")*\n\nNow, for the ones that still **w**ish to bump heads and repeat the same arguments from years ago about a show that has, for the most part, left the public consciousness - welcome! It'll be fun.\n\nI, like many here, have been a fan of AOT ever since the animation premiered back in 2013. I've watched all the available episodes, then waited for the weekly releases while burrowing myself deep within the fanbase - reading t**h**eories, discussing plot elements, engaging with fan creations.\n\nAfter the first season was over, I moved over to the manga. For years, I religiously waited for that monthly release to then, afterwards, spend hours in a variety of online forums discussing where the story was going.\n\nThen the basement reveal came. Then the focus of the story shifted. Then **a** new cast of characters were introduced. Then I moved out, got a job, started college. Then AOT fell into the background.\n\nI returned to the story in 2021. No particular reason for it, I just remembered it existed.\n\nI caught up with the manga just in time to wait for the last 3 chapters.\n\nI**t** was a peculiar feeling. Here was this *thing* - this piece of media that had been such a staple in my life, and it was quickly coming to an end. Not only that, but the (normally) focused discussion regarding the narrative had, at some point, splintered into so many theories, opinions and analysis. \n\nPeople wrote thousand-word thesis on the manga's conclusion using complementary media that was only tangentially connected with the story as reference. Factions of fans coalesced to defend, detract or make fun of an ending that hadn't even happened yet.\n\nIt was a lot to take in. Especially after the **a**ctual ending came.\n\nAnd, man... that ending. What hasn't been said about that ending?\n\nI mean, you guys would know. This sub was flooded with thread after thread of hate, love and everything in between by people desperate to talk about their opinions.\n\nI don't blame them for coming here. Have you tried posting anything on *any* of the dedicated AOT subs?\n\nr/ShingekiNoKyojin is just \"look at this thing I drew\" or \"look at my risqu\u00e9 cosplay, but don't comment on any of the risqu\u00e9 elements\".\n\nr/attackontitan is the anime version of facebook memes.\n\nr/AttackOnRetards is a repository of *\"people who dislike the ending have no life!\"* threads made by people who have no life.\n\nr/titanfolk ...yeah, let's **m**ove on.\n\nHere I can get a (slightly) neutral response, and that's why I'm adding another thread to the worthless \"AOT fell off\" pile. Bear with me, please.\n\n\n\nRecently, my girlfriend decided she wanted to watch AOT. I was resistant at first, but caved after realizing I would be able to watch the 2nd and 3rd seasons animated, since I hadn't gone back to the anime after moving to the manga.\n\nWe watched the last movie **a** couple of days ago, and all I could think about was that one time I botched a nice pot of minestrone.\n\nI got to relieve that amazing first season and all of its hype moments. I got to see the other two seasons adapted by WIT. I got to experience the whole story, now with the full context from all those years.\n\nAnd all I could think about was that one time I botched a nice pot of mi**n**estrone.\n\nI was setting up to start cooking, only to realize I just had a single, depressingly old onion shoved deep down my fridge. It looked dry, smelled sweet and was slightly gooey, but I still used it.\n\nI sat down to eat and quickl**y** realized that the small bit of onion I had added seeped every drop of its *oldness* into the soup. Everything had acquired that sweet, rotten taste *just enough* to debase the eating experience, but not to justify throwing it all away.\n\nMy bowl was there, filled with some nice carrots, peppers, tomatoes, pasta and cheese, but I wouldn't be able to enjoy them, because the rotten aftertaste of the onions would quickly follow. I gobbled it all up, though. \n\nThat's how I felt rewatching Attack on Titan.\n\nI can't enjoy that juicy, savory bell pepper called Erwin Smith, because I know he'll sh**o**w up as a ghost in the last battle to look reassuring about something he would never endorse.\n\nI can't feel that acidic tang of the tomatoes that is Levi, because I know he'll become a plot device, a battered p**u**ppet that somehow survives the last battle against hordes of shifters, and then gets to be carted around in a wheelchair by unbaked characters.\n\nI can't taste some of the broth of worldbuilding with a piece of bread, because the world I was finally getting to know was tossed to the side for a new one that didn't even start to get developed. \n\nI c**a**n't feel anything while watching a scene where a 10-year old kid swears he'll avenge his mother, not only because I know he's the reason his mother is dead, but because he commented on it like he was simply going through a grocery list. \n\n*\"Oh, yeah, almost forgot, I killed my mom. I'm a slave to destiny lol!\"*\n\n\n\nI loved this story for long. And now I can't take that awful **r**otten taste out of my mouth.\n\n\n\nIsayama and I are the same. I am a lousy cook, he is a lousy writer. \n\nI used a rotten, spoiled onion because I thought it wouldn't matter, because I thought I knew better.\n\nHe though he would be able to flesh out a compl**e**x political narrative in 48 chapters. He thought he knew better.\n\nThe only difference is that the people eating my slop didn't compliment me on it. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nMan...\n\nAttack on Titan really doesn't hold up on rewatches.",

            "Exactly. One thing that few people call out is that Luffy's final rogue gallery has gotten so huge (Akainu, Blackbeard and Imu) that is most likely that we will never see a satisfactory battle between Luffy and those three. \n\n\n Luffy has a  beef with these three. Akainu killed his brother, Blackbeard contributed to his brother dead and is another contestant for the One Piece and Luffy has been set up as Imu's archinemesis. \n\n\nAnd I agree with you OP. One Piece has gotten so huge but it forgotten the strawhats. Majority of them havent had character arcs. Few of them are actively pursuing their dreams. Even in Egghead, the Giants got more battles with all those Viceadmirals and the Gorosei.\n\n\nPeople said that Wano was supposed to be Zoro's arc and it wasnt. Franky didnt have the spot expected in Egghead. Hell I'd say that Egghead must have been Chopper and Robin arc too since Chopper could have learnt stuff to be a better doctor and Robin should have asked more stuff or sources of info about Void Century. But nah. Literally Oda sent Robin to sleep LMAO. Look that Lilith and Atlas are aboard. They may steal usefulness to Chopper, Robin and even Franky.\n\n\nFor that reason is that I love the theory of Luffy being locked by WG and strawhats have the spotlight for the rest of the arcs. It may not make sense. But theres a chance: Marygoise food supplies were destroyed during Kuma vs Akainu. So Gorosei could keep Luffy locked in Marygoise until they have the fruit that matches the Sun God fruit in order to make the fruit respawning under their power. So the  Final War would revolve around avoiding sending food to Marygoise.",

That's first thing that comes to mind about his character and that's what he's been like for a long time. \n\nZoro is stoic badass.  No longer as much of the right hand he felt like back in post Enies Lobby\n\nSanji is a simp\n\nUsopp cries about every battle and runs away. \n\nThe depth of the Strawhats character development took a massive hit and it's a big turn off",
            "I would only say this is a problem in arcs Relating to a specific straw hat Because now all the straw hats need developing at all times Especially if they're not on screen. What I mean by specific I mean it has a theme that is related to a straw hat Not that it is about That specific crew member",

        "content": "The evil timeline doppleganger  concept has surprisingly not been done   all that well over the past  couple years or so. Which is surprising isn\u2019t it? One would think that having an actual evil version of the main character would invite a lot of potential to have nuanced storytelling.  But Instead what usually ends up happening is that these alternate timeline villains are so far removed from the protagonist that they end up feeling like any old generic villain. \n\nA big example of this being injustice Superman. \nNow Although I know  it was confirmed that injustice is not a alternate timeline but rather just an alternate dimension, however for the sake of my argument I will included it anyway. Main reason being because bar for bar the injustice dimension is eerily similar to the main dc continuity. So what is the problem with injustice Superman? Well to answer that question we gotta also ask who is Superman? And that\u2019s not hard to answer at all. Superman  is a man  who grew up in Kansas as Clark Kent under the loving watch of his parents Jonathan and Martha Kent. His parents instilled a great sense of morality in him allowing him to come to appreciate humanity as a whole. He grows up to become Superman a man who cares so much about his friends and other people\u2019s wellbeing\u2019s that he is even willing to extend his hand to villains who seem to be struggling with their own problems. Superman at the end of the day is a character whose love and understanding nature often makes him overprotective of the people around him. Not even other superheroes like Batman who often will try to sway Clark from helping him can escape his grasp because he will help him anyway by  putting his body on the line every time because that\u2019s just who Clark is\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd.  \n\nBut if you don\u2019t trust my words just watch this clip from justice league unlimited https://youtu.be/0kffqSXcTOc?feature=shared. Superman of course in this situation doesn\u2019t want to fight atom but atom is not a guy who will go against military orders as he is a us military soldier first before he is a superhero/ jl member. thus it gets to the point where Superman has a knocked down dragged out fight with atom and he eventually beats him. What\u2019s stands out in this scene however is the moment after he knocks atom out because instead of allowing the medics to work on atom in his injured state, he picks him up, carries him and says \u201c he is one of us\u201d and just walks off. This scene to me encapsulates everything on who Superman is. \n\nWith the way I described Superman does this sound like a guy who would murder a child for a simple disagreement? Does this sound like a guy who would murder his friends because they wish to oppose his regime? Does this SOUND  LIKE A guy who would use criminals to fight against his own friends? DOES THiS SOUND LIKE A GUY who would murder his own friends because they killed his parent accidentally? No of course not. my problem with injustice superman was always the fact that it felt like you could replace him with any evil generic dictator because he barely cares about the people around him and will kill his friends  just because of some moderate  resistance. Injustice Superman is just so  indifferent, and uncaring about the people that are even helping him,  that it\u2019s uncomfortable for me  to even call this man a different version of Superman.\n\n So how would I go about fixing it? Ideally if Superman was to go into the deep end his most important traits should taken to its logical extremes. Instead of injustice Superman wanting to MURDER his friends he should be imprisoning them,  trying to convince them that what he is doing is right. Injustice Superman should be very protective of his friends that are working on his side, to the point that it becomes overbearing even because the death of Lois would hurt him that much. Superman best traits like his loving, understanding and overprotective nature should become so extreme that they become his worst traits. Honestly I could even see it getting so bad to the point where Superman would want to shoulder all the problems in the world and would deem other superheroes other than himself unnecessary.\n\nInjustice Superman at least in my opinion should not have an army he is the army. \n\nNow I gave  you an example of writers doing a time doppelg\u00e4nger wrong and how to fix it but I want to touch  on  a story that did it correctly.\n\nSo re zero for those who don\u2019t know is a isekai anime where an ordinary guy named natsuki Subaru gets transported to a very fictionalized medieval world. Sounds pretty generic right? The difference in this story is that unlike other protagonist in isekai stories who are summoned with very op abilities, the only ability that natsuki Subaru possesses is the fact he can rewind time upon death. This makes for very nuanced story telling in my opinion because it often touches on the hopelessness and self hatred he feels when people die around him and he can\u2019t do anything to stop it.\n\nNow in the main story natsuki Subaru learns to channel his worst traits in more productive manors and learns to become better overall\u2026 but  in the if story\u2019s that the author likes to write on Subaru birthday it\u2019s a little different. \n\nSee because the female character named Emilia in this series was the first person to \u201csave him\u201d he falls in hopelessly in  love with her to the point where it becomes even a very  toxic in later episodes.  In alot of ways you can say the series first actual villain  named petelgeuse who is crazily obsessed with the \u201cdead\u201d witch who looks like Emilia is meant to mirror Subaru and where he could potentially end up like. For more of a reference on the parallels between natsuki and  petelgeuse I suggest watching this video https://youtu.be/LIzogLLIDbE?si=vGEmXWLOkFMIlb4-\n\nPoint is in the pride if alternative universe story instead of asking for a knight to help him  he chooses to fight an a assassin named Elsa over and over again with Emilia until he just becomes insane. his overbearing love  for Emilia just becomes obsessive to the point that he cares about nothing except helping  Emilia achieve her goal of winning the royal election. After escaping the first loop the normally quirky  and overdramatic natsuki Subaru  has now become  erratic and unstable. Throughout the  what if story natsuki goes on to kill other royal candidates and even other villains so he can become the ultimate villain that emilia strikes down so that everyone will choose her to become  queen. Funny thing about this plan  however see remember that knight I mentioned earlier? Yeah the guy natsuki didn\u2019t want to ask for help in this story? \n\nWell his name his Reinhard the strongest existence in the re zero world. Reinhard is every bit as op as Subaru wished he was and he despises it. Natsuki tries hundred no thousands of ways trying to kill Reinhard  but in the end all he could settle for was just engulfing the kingdom in flames using a spirit to destroy his name as a hero because he can\u2019t kill him. And even after his \u201cvictory\u201d  in this story Subaru cries\u2026 when Subaru was summoned in this world he believed he would have op powers to save  People just like other isekai protagonist. However upon realizing that all he was good for was seeing the people he loved die in front of him and trying again just to see the same scenes made him despise an existence like Reinhard who he is everything he wished he was. Natsuki wished he had Reinhards  op powers so he wouldn\u2019t have to resort to such dirty tactics. He could stand by Emilia\u2019s side protecting and defeating  any and every threat that came her way with ease if that was the case.\n\nNatsuki Subaru hates himself to his core, and no matter what timeline or what if story he is in that won\u2019t change. \n\nThe story ends with Emilia killing him as he planed becoming satisfied with his death. \n\nTo cut it short  because this has already been a long rant, What I love about this story is just how much you can see  the original timeline natsuki in pride if natuski. His love  For Emilia becomes obsessive, his hatred for his lack of power causes him to hate people like Reinhard and above all else the funny part is even becoming his worst self pride  Subaru will only do evil if he deems it necessary in achieving his goal for Emilia. He isn\u2019t a guy who likes to torture people just for kicks, heck even when killing the most vile people who walked on re zero planet like an guy named regulus. Subaru still wishes to give out an  death that are quick and efficient. He dislikes his partners in crime especially Elsa who is a sadist who loves to torture people as they die. He even shows some sadness for the death of character like meli who is a child assassin working with him but his obsession with Emilia wouldn\u2019t allow him to do anything differently. In the end I can totally see the core principles of natsuki in pride if natsuki. ",

            "I agree. I always hated how the \u201cevil\u201d version of good characters stray so far from the characteristics that are traditional to them the idea isn\u2019t even fun.\n\nAs you said, it would be way more interesting for \u201cevil\u201d Superman not to be a genocidal freak but still have his relative kindness, be focused on controlling everything but under the guise of protection- i think the main issue is that it\u2019s simply easier to write the evil \u201cgood guy\u201d as being hitler as opposed to actually thinking long term about how an established character would genuinely act if they lost it",
            "Honestly, I think the Justice Lords episode of the Justice League cartoon does a better job with the idea of Evil Superman than Injustice does.",
            ">Natsuki Subaru hates himself deeply, and no matter what timeline or story he's in, that won't change.\n\n\n*Mimagal and lust if enter in the chat\u00a0",
            "\"Red Son\" comes to mind as a version of Superman that is \"evil\" without being a villain and still retains his recognizable characteristics. The focus is on control and how he must look after the well-being of humans. It's a comic that I enjoyed a lot, and its ending is quite satisfying. To me, it represents the concept very well.",
            "Completely agree.\n\nWhile not exactly what you're talking about, one of my main issues with the Supes from The Boys is that most of them don't have anything in common with the originals other than their powersets.\n\nTo give an example of a good deconstruction, I think Soldier Boy is a neat deconstruction of Captain America, mainly because his status of being a living relic from a previous time is shown as causing some genuine problems, namely, he comes off as deeply bigoted by todays standards, because the unfortunate fact is that\u2019s kind of how most American men were back in the 40s.\n\nWhat I especially like is that he isn't just blindly bigoted, he's explicitly shown to lack the Anti-Arab and Muslim prejudice that many modern conservative men possess, and is even shown to be genuinely fond of Afghanistan, because he was around before the War on Terror started and during the Cold War, where Afghanistan was one of the U.S's allies against the Soviet Union.\n\nIt's a great reminder that people's values are shaped largely by the environment they grow up in, for better or for worse.",
            "Gods and Monsters had a good example of a Superman that was darker, but still had the core part of Superman, even if not necessarily evil.",
            "[I made my own version of this, albeit focusing on the concept of Evil Superman.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/s/zzVd5NET0C) It\u2019s surprising how rare it is to see evil counterparts that actually reflect the character themselves instead of just being a meatsuit for a generic villain.",
            "Whenever I see an evil time doppelganger I think of Evil Troy and Evil Abed from Community and simply cannot take them seriously",
            "I was honestly about to mention the Pride IF when I saw this post. Subaru's such a complex and interesting character, and I love how every IF story the author makes takes his preexisting character flaws and exacerbates them under the right circumstances.\n\n* Pride IF: Exacerbates Subaru's obsessive determination and how he forces his feelings onto Emilia in a delusion of grandeur, how his desire to do something for Emilia was only really self-serving in the end\n* Wrath IF: Exacerbates Subaru's self-hatred, rashness, and inability to understand others into full-blown fear of people as Subaru loses the ability to trust anyone, even himself\n* Sloth IF: Exacerbates Subaru's desire to give up on himself and run from his problems. Or at least it would, if he didn't have Rem with him. I love this IF story, because you can see every time Subaru would succumb to his slothful mentality if Rem wasn't with him.\n* Greed IF: Exacerbates Subaru's self-sacrificial nature, suicidal ideation, desperate fear of losing his loved ones and belief that he has no value outside of his death. It results in a Subaru who abused Return By Death to ensure his loved ones never face any danger, and kills himself countless times for any reason because his life has no value",
            "oooh danny phantom did this!!! :) and they actually had a really good reason why danny's evil time traveler self was kind of just \"generic evil\"! it was cause he lost his whole family and friends in an explosion, then went to stay with his evil uncle and asked him to remove his ghost powers, but ended up splitting his human and ghost halfs, and his ghost half then merged with his UNCLE's evil ghost half, creating a messed up super fused evil ghost!\n\ndanny's ghost half also murdered his human half immediately lol...which makes danny phantom more fucked up than urizen from DMC5 lol... (why didn't urizen kill V btw?!)"
