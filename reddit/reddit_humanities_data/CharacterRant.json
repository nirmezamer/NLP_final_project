Per our (very old) sub description:\n\n>This is a sub inspired by r/whowouldwin. There have been countless meta posts complaining about characters or explanations as to why X beats, and so on. So the purpose of this sub is to allow those who want to rant about a character or explain why X beats Y and so on.\n\nHowever, as early as 2015, we were already getting threads ranting about the quality of specific series, complaining about characterization, and just general shittery not all that related to \"who would win: 10 million bees vs 1 lion\".\n\nSo, per Post Rules 1 in the sidebar:\n\n>Thread Topics: You may talk about why you like or dislike a specific character, why you think a specific character is overestimated or underestimated. You may talk about and clear up any misconceptions you've seen about a specific character. You may talk about a fictional event that has happened, or a concept such as ki, chakra, or speedforce.\n\nWell that's certainly kinda vague isn't it?\n\n# So what can and can't be posted in CharacterRant?\n\n\u2705 **Allowed:**\n\n* **Battleboarding** in general (with two exceptions down below)\n* **Explanations**, **rants**, and **complaints** on, and about: characters, characterization, character development, a character's feats, plot points, fictional concepts, fictional events, tropes, inaccuracies in fiction, and the power scaling of a series.\n* **Non-fiction** content is fine as long as it's somehow relevant to the elements above, such as: analysis and explanations on wars, history and/or geopolitics; complaints on the perception of historical events by the general media or the average person; explanation on what nation would win what war or conflict.\n\n\u274c **Not allowed:**\n\n* he 2 Battleboarding exceptions: 1) hypothetical scenarios, as those belong in r/whowouldwin;2) pure calculations - you can post a \"fancalc\" on a feat or an event as long as you also bring forth a bare minimum amount of discussion accompanying it; no \"I calced this feat at 10 trillion gigajoules, thanks bye\" posts.\n* Explanations, rants and complaints on the technical aspect of production of content - e.g. complaints on how a movie literally looks too dark; the CGI on a TV show looks unfinished; a manga has too many lines; a book uses shitty quality paper; a comic book uses an incomprehensible font; a song has good guitars.\n* Politics that somehow don't relate to the elements listed in the \"Allowed\" section - e.g. this country's policies are bad, this government is good, this politician is dumb.\n* Entertainment topics that somehow don't relate to the elements listed in the \"Allowed\" section - e.g. this celebrity has bad opinions, this actor is a good/bad actor, this actor got cast for this movie, this writer has dumb takes on Twitter, social media is bad.\n\n# ADDENDUM -\n\n* *Politics in relation to a series and discussion of those politics is fine, however political discussion outside said series or how it relates to said series is a no, no baggins'*\n* *Overly broad takes on tropes and and genres? Henceforth not allowed. If you are to discuss the genre or trope you MUST have specifics for your rant to be focused on. (Specific Characters or specific stories)*\n* *Rants about Fandom or fans in general? Also being sent to the shadow realm, you are not discussing characters or anything relevant once more to the purpose of this sub*\n* *A friendly reminder that this sub is for rants about characters and series, things that have specificity to them and not broad and vague annoyances that you thought up in the shower.*\n\n**And our already established rules**:\n\n* No low effort threads.\n* No threads in response to topics from other threads, and avoid posting threads on currently over-posted topics - e.g. saw 2 rants about the same subject in the last 24 hours, avoid posting one more.\n* No threads solely to ask questions.\n* No unapproved meta posts. Ask mods first and we'll likely say yes.\n\n**PS**: We can't ban people or remove comments for being inoffensively dumb. Stop reporting opinions or people you disagree with as \"dumb\" or \"misinformation\".\n\n# Why was my thread removed? What counts as a Low Effort Thread?\n\n* If you posted something and it was removed, these are the two most likely options:\\*\\*\n* Your account is too new or inactive to bypass our filters\n* Your post was low effort\n\n**\"Low effort\"** is somewhat subjective, but you know it when you see it. Only a few sentences in the body, simply linking a picture/article/video, the post is just some stupid joke, etc. They aren't all that bad, and that's where it gets blurry. Maybe we felt your post was just a bit too short, or it didn't really \"say\" anything. If that's the case and you wish to argue your position, message us and we might change our minds and approve your post.\n\n# What counts as a Response thread or an over-posted topic? Why do we get megathreads?\n\n1. A **response thread** is pretty self explanatory. Does your thread only exist because someone else made a thread or a comment you want to respond to? Does your thread explicitly link to another thread, or say \"there was this recent rant that said X\"? These are response threads. Now obviously the Mod Team isn't saying that no one can ever talk about any other thread that's been posted here, just use common sense and give it a few days.\n2. Sometimes there are so many threads being posted here about the same subject that the Mod Team reserves the right to **temporarily restrict** said topic or a portion of it. This usually happens after a large series ends, or controversial material comes out (i.e The AOT ban after the penultimate chapter, or the Dragon Ball ban after years of bullshittery on every DB thread). Before any temporary ban happens, there will always be a **Megathread** on the subject explaining why it has been temporarily kiboshed and for roughly how long. Obviously there can be no threads posted outside the Megathread when a restriction is in place, and the Megathread stays open for discussions.\n\n# Reposts\n\n* A \"repost\" is when you make a thread with the same opinion, covering the exact same topic, of another rant that has been posted here by anyone, including yourself.\n* \u2705 It's allowed when the original post has less than 100 upvotes or has been archived (it's 6 months or older)\n* \u274c It's not allowed when the original post has more than 100 upvotes and hasn't been archived yet (posted less than 6 months ago)\n\n# Music\n\nUsers have been asking about it so we made it official.\n\nTo avoid us becoming a subreddit to discuss new songs and albums, which there are plenty of, we limit ourselves regarding music:\n\n* \u2705 **Allowed:** analyzing the storytelling aspect of the song/album, a character from the music, or the album's fictional themes and events.\n* \u274c **Not allowed:** analyzing the technical and sonical aspects of the song/album and/or the quality of the lyricism, of the singing or of the sound/production/instrumentals.\n\n**TL;DR**: you can post a lot of stuff but try posting good rants please\n\n*-Yours truly, the beautiful mod team*",

        "content": "There are times where I'll see a complaint against a series that makes me wonder if the person has ever actually watched or read any other series, especially in the same genre or medium.\n\nAs an example, I once saw someone complaining about how MHA's Culture Festival arc was so disappointing and such a wasted opportunity because it kept the focus on Midoriya and 1-A instead of having the other classes be the focus of the arc.\n\n...Something NO ANIME that does a school festival arc does.\n\nTypically the exact point of school festival arcs in anime and manga is to explore how the main cast of characters the story follows react to such a classic situation. They never just drop the focus completely from the protagonist and the main cast to go focus on a bunch of supplementary characters just to fill out the world a little more; usually because that would be nowhere near as interesting for the audience as continuing to follow the actually important characters they're invested in will be.\n\nI can understand being interested in what something like that could be like, but to hold it against a series and say it's bad for not doing something no other series like it does makes it almost feel like that person really needs to expand on the media they consume when they're judging a series that much in a vacuum.\n\nOr another post, where the person, dissatisfied with the Disney era Star Wars media, said that they think Disney should make two separate timelines for Star Wars like Marvel and DC do; one universe being the current timeline that Disney has made and the other being a timeline based off George Lucas\u2019s original ideas of the force and the Old Republic. That way they could appease everyone.\n\nWhen people naturally pointed out that Disney *already* does that, with stuff in the old EU timeline being sold under the \"Legends\" banner, they clarified that they meant multiple cinematic universes, i.e. movies.\n\nSomething which not only do Marvel and DC not do, NOBODY does that.\n\nThe Marvel movies used to be divided into Spider-Man, X-Men, and MCU universes but that's because the film rights were owned by different companies. It wasn't a choice by Disney to have separate cinematic universes, and in fact once they were able to get Spider-Man into the MCU they didn't allow Sony to make any more live action Spider-Man movies, thus why all the such in their cinematic universe has been using his villains and supporting characters, and since buying X-Men and Fantastic Four they're trying to find a way to incorporate them directly into the MCU (probably through Deadpool 3). They're not going to have the X-Men in their own separate universe alongside the MCU.\n\nAs for DC, since trying to start up their own cinematic universe all but two of their live action movies have been part of that shared universe, the exceptions being Joker and The Batman, both of which are restricted solely to those specific characters. The rest of the DC universe and its characters are never going to be a part of them. And with the DCEU failing to meet the expectations they had for it, they're now starting over from scratch with a new cinematic universe, and the old one is not going to be running alongside it, it's just over, with any leftovers potentially going to be folded into the new universe (we'll see how that turns out).\n\nEven the Godzilla movies are divided between two different studios, with Legendary doing the Monsterverse and Toho making more traditional Godzilla films.\n\nMovie studios don't have multiple cinematic universes going at the same time. Heck, studios barely do that with TV cinematic universes, with the Bat-embargo being a famous example with how it kept Teen Titans, The Batman (2004), and The Dark Knight Trilogy from having some of the same characters appearing because the studio thought audiences would think all three took place in the same universe. Disney has no reason to have two timelines going through the movies they release as opposed to just continuing to release additions to the one they've got going or scrapping it entirely and restarting everything like a Halloween franchise. It'd be a confusing waste of money.",

It's not an evolving alternate canon, it was permanently cut off in 2012, with the painfully ironically named \"X-Wing: Mercy Kill\" being the last entry",

            "No, they complained that 1-B, or any of the other classes, weren't THE focus of the arc. They complained that the arc still kept the focus on the main cast of characters of 1-A instead of using the school festival to focus on the rest of the school.\n\nEssentially they were condemning the arc for having the story continue to be about the characters the story is about."

During the eclipse invasion Zuko has Ozai at his mercy, but doesn\u2019t finish him off, claiming that it\u2019s the avatar\u2019s destiny to do it. Why is destiny a factor in this situation? Is the idea that there\u2019s some sort of cosmic mandate that nobody but Aang can take care of Ozai, or else bad things will happen somehow? \n\nAs for Iroh\u2019s reasoning, this one makes a little bit more sense. Explaining that it\u2019s the more peaceful way to end the war, as opposed to history remembering it as a guy killing his brother for the throne. And yes, I\u2019m sure there would be major backlash from certain people in the fire nation if Iroh did it himself. But then again, wouldn\u2019t the same hold true if Aang also did it?

What people remember of the Avatar is 100 years ago he failed or refused to stop the war, and his replacement disappeared when they needed him most. While since Aang's return he's helped many people and done much to restore belief in the Avatar, the war itself is a looming shadow on all of that. The Avatar needs to be the one to end it, otherwise going forward no one will ever forget how the Avatar failed them, and they'll never trust the Avatar the same way again.",

            "It's an idealistic show, so the idea of magic Jesus/Buddha bringing an end to the terror is poetic. In the real world oppressive regimes are usually brought low by lots of killing, but the creators of Aang probably don't care for that.",
