            "Absolutely not. He doesn't want the job because he's smart enough to stay in his lane. It's a nice thought, but in reality he's never campaigned for any elected office before. While he is a popular comedian, many people would consider a Stewart candidacy a joke. It would be a huge risk and Stewart would be the first person to say \"no way, that's fucking insane.\""

But Jon\u2019s point that we need to hold elected officials to higher standards, and that it\u2019s the candidate\u2019s job to convince us (the voter) of his or her electability is ringing truer than ever after that circus last night. \n\nIt\u2019d be funny if the fate of the country didn\u2019t hang in the balance.",

Foreign interference has played our population like a chess grand master in a game of tic-tac-toe. \n\nWe have supported all Americans. We can support all Americans. A person like Jon can rekindle the mutual reverence that was lost when we began to rely on media streams that were feeding a starved population. We left behind the morality that fused our nation together through decades for decisive views that barely affect us as individuals. \n\nWe have more in common with other Americans than we realize, because we are all here, struggling together. We work, go to school, and spend each day of our lives together. We are all here. We are all struggling. We are all left behind.\n\nJon Stewart sees it. He preaches it. He carries a burden we used to share, and I believe he could be the right person to show our people that we are actually still here, still together. And I truly believe, if given the platform, Jon could be one of the voices that reunites this country.",
