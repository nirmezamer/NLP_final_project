            "All commentary about the debate aside this episode kind of sucked. His monologue? Awesome as always. But I expected an hour (which is what YTTV has it set as) of commentary, with an interview or two and some segments are the corespondents. \n\nWhen Jon cut off the therapist and apologized that they were short on time I was like wait...what? You're going to do a live post debate show and half the episode is this interview? Like I love the idea of having her on but on a normal episode or if they had an hour and the interview was just a small portion of that. \n\nIt was a great monologue and I'm happy we got that. But man I was expecting a really cool hour long special, or atleast thirty minutes spent on the debate and with a more relevant guest.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?",
            "You can Stewart didn\u2019t think Biden did well, from just one sentence.",

I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d rather gnaw on hunks of broken glass than consider political office.",

But Jon\u2019s point that we need to hold elected officials to higher standards, and that it\u2019s the candidate\u2019s job to convince us (the voter) of his or her electability is ringing truer than ever after that circus last night. \n\nIt\u2019d be funny if the fate of the country didn\u2019t hang in the balance.",

It\u2019s the Biden administration v a new iteration of the Trump administration. And v2 of the Trump administration is going to be far worse than v1. So yeah, I wish Joe had stepped aside, I do, but at this point his administration is far more competent and far less dangerous than anything Trump will put together. And that SHOULD be how we frame this. Because the chance to have a different Dem nominee is long gone. And, quite frankly, it\u2019s how every presidential election should be framed.",

McGovern in 72?\n\nClearly, the DNC would rather lose to Trump than win with an outsider they don't fully control, e.g. Sanders in 2016 or even Newsom in 2024.\n\nBiden showed obvious signs of mental decline in 2020, as compared to 2016. The DNC didn't care and most Democratic voters clearly didn't care.\n\nBiden has clearly declined further -- much further -- since then. The DNC still didn't care. And Democratic voters were still in the same echo chamber, quick to attack anyone who dared to criticize a second term for a doddering old man.\n\nIf the DNC cared about winning, and cared about doing the right thing by the country (rather than preserving the status quo), they would either have forced Biden to step down, or at least not strong-armed candidates like Newsom from offering a soft 'kid gloves' challenge of Biden, to pick up the torch if Biden faltered.\n\nIf they didn't think Biden could handle a primary race and debate, why did they think he could handle a general election campaign and debate?\n\nAt the very least, the DNC should have helped put Newsom on the ticket with a very public wink and nod that Newsom would step in if and when Biden deteriorates further and the 25th Amendment needs to be invoked.\n\nKamala Harris has zero charisma, zero speaking skills, and inspires zero confidence. She couldn't talk her way out of a moment of silence.\n\nFrankly, I fear even putting Newsom on the ticket now would be too little, too late.\n\nThe DNC is betting the entire pot, America's constitutional Republic and world security on a weak, senile, and doddering old man. But hey -- status quo baby, they get rich either way!",
