        "content": "Why, most of the time when I play as Abathur, I get teams that deliberately neglect laning and expect me as Abathur to lane top and bottom by myself with low-level talents. I get that Abathur's main objective is to soak experience and push. But I can't contest two enemies pushing both lanes simultaneously at the beginning of the game with low-level talents. While playing as Abathur on Tomb of the Spider Queen, I thought it was a good idea to go mine build to make it difficult to turn in gems and give vision to my teammates to help prevent them from doing so. I also communicated this and asked my team to help with laning. Instead, they chose to fight mid-lane while the enemy pushed both the bottom and top lane and turned in gems. And guess what? The Diablo player on my team dared to complain about me not laning and said he's a level 43 Abathur as if he knows what he's talking about. While our team was behind on experience, fed the enemy multiple times and neglected the enemy non-stop pushed lanes. It wouldn't make sense for me to go push build when the map is small and the objective is to turn in gems. I don't know why players think Abathur is meant to do everything that the team lacks and fix everything, then put all the blame on the Abathur. Abthur can only work with what he got. ",

            "> I get that Abathur's main objective is to soak experience and push.\n\n\nAbathur's main goal is to support teammates so that in any even fight of 1v1 to 4v4 they get a symbiote worth half a hero's power, tipping the odds in their favor.\u00a0\n\n\nSoaking is a smaller part of it, and pushing is not involved.\u00a0",
            "Spider Queen - I always go hat build - still try to pick up xp with hat wherever I can. Everytime I try Mine build it doesn't work so I stopped doing it. If you go Clone - and have good clone candidates you can seriously help contest coin drops from enemy team. Push build doesn't make sense, agree - but I don't have much success with mine ever. I dunno.. maybe some people do? My go-to with Abby is hat build unless my team is just... or the map is .... just... there's got to be some special circumstances I don't go hat build I guess.",
            "Reading anything someone typed in a QM was the first mistake, lol.",
            "The thing with Abathur in my experience is it's always an unholy combination of the team not understand how to play with an Abathur and the Abathur wanting to play whatever fuck build they want. \n\nAlways devolves into some sort of circus show where the team keeps trying to 4v5 while throwing all the soaking to Aba who realistically does not soak very well early game and the Aba who just goes Mines and Monstrosity when the team clearly needs more team fight presence.",
            "There is no reason to ever have to soak lanes for people on the spider queen map.  Sure its 3 lanes but its so tiny that just about anyone can double soak and rotate around a lot.  I personally like hat build and mine build on that map since it has two areas for the objective and people are rotating constantly.  Soaking as abathur is bad on it too since you want your team to get gems.",
            "no. its just people in general are mentally ill and not managing it",
            "If this is quickmatch then I don't know what you expect. QM is for fun, trying out new heroes, or just practicing mechanics. People complaining about non-optimal play in qm has always been silly. Just mute the trolls and have fun. If it was storm league then it sounds like something that should have been discussed with team in draft.",
