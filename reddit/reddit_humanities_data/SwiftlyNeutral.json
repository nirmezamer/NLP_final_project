            "Something I've been thinking about is how much people want to be 'right' about Taylor. I think some of this is Taylor's fault for gamifying things (but never her personal life). It's just interesting to see when I and others could not care less about that side of her fame.",
            "I find Kayleigh Teller to be very strange.",
            "I saw folks sharing their own lists here of tracks they like and I never fully felt like I could do that yet. So far, I streamed the anthology 15 times now (long commute) and the only fully developed cohesive standouts are:\n\n- Guilty As Sin?\n- The Manuscript\n- loml\n- Peter\n- Robin\n- Clara Bow\n\nMost of the album is now forgotten or not enjoyable at this point. I just took these out in a separate album and stream them.",
            "Again with the paternity test about The Black Dog all over this fandom. I actually once cared about this, but now I'm just so over it. Matty doesn't care about Taylor, he's engaged. Joe possibly cares even less. Travis is just shaking it off. If she's sending signs she's just being a fool, which I don't believe she is actually.\u00a0\n\n\nTo me personally she's playing swifties as fools because she knows people will try to decode songs that sometimes just go well together. Swifties are just doing a huge favor by streaming the songs 25251717 more times to discover hidden meanings and some think it's Joe, others are sure it's Matty, some have entire thesis it's even Kylie, a minority believe it's Harry Styles and everyone swear they have better evidence. It's honestly exhausting at this point.\u00a0",
            "That fire video was too funny! I\u2019m glad nothing bad happened and everyone was okay. \n\nAlso cat crumbs! I love seeing her cats",

            "I miss the sub when it was on private lol\n\nLike I like this place because it is neutral. But when you have people from that sub just piling on - it's hard to engage when you know it's not a good faith discussion. \n\nAnd I find it hard to take the person seriously when they rail about the stupidity of swifties and then proceed to display the same behaviour and spread misinformation to suit their own narratives. It's beyond weird to hate someone so much you post about her endlessly in snark subs AND pop culture subs",
            "I had a friend who\u2019s a huge Swiftie in my car for a long ride and she played mostly recent Taylor. I didn\u2019t realize just how repetitive some of her rhymes are and how she repurposes some lyrics. I still enjoy her music but this is why I can\u2019t listen to a playlist of her recent works.",
            "I think there was a post about this earlier. But I\u2019m very sick of the \u201cx city won.\u201d Feels like she just uses the same 5 base songs to match with others"

I am not ready. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll make a big announcement except for maybe a music video. She just released the behind the scenes for Fortnight.

            "If you actually went through every artists interactions/collabs, you will find that the artists who stand up against stuff like sexual abuse, harassment, especially of minors and women, have 100% of the times interacted with someone who's involved in such stuff. Its gross. Artists don't actually care about these things. They speak a normal line and gain followers. The most recent example, apart from Taylor ofc, is Kendrick. He literally called out Drake for being a creep and pedo, also abandoning his kids. But just few days ago, Dr Dre opened up his concert. Dr. Dre has been accused by multiple women for abusing and beating them up. That was maybe decades ago, but still, the fact he never apologised properly proves he never improved as a person. How can Kendrick call out Drake, when he literally collabed with Kodak Black? A guy who was arrested for sexual assault, and battery to a TEEN GIRL?\u00a0\n\n\nThis is just the few popular examples. The real losers in this whole fight are victims themselves. These people just support them in fake manner to increase followers and use them as weapons to bring other artists down. No one actually cares about them. Its really hard to find an artist who hasn't collabed with someone that does not have a past related to gross things like these, makes me wonder if the artists themselves choose voluntarily to collab with people like them or the industry is so corrupted that you just can't enter and NOT meet people like these, they are everywhere.",
