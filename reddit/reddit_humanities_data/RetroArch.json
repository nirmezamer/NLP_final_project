            "Q: My game is broken/won't launch/looks weird in PCSX2-libretro/LRPS2 core!\n\nA: Yes, that core is not in great shape. It works well enough when it works, but if it doesn't work, there's not a whole lot to be done about it, unfortunately. We hope to improve things with it at some point, but in the meantime, your best bet if you run into a problem is to use PCSX2 outside of RetroArch. It's a great emulator and has had a lot of improvements of its own since our preliminary core was forked off anyway.",
            "Q: I can't find a core I would like to use in the 'load core' list. (commonly dolphin-libretro, ppsspp-libretro, citra-libretro, etc.)\n\nA: Not all platforms can run all cores, so which ones are available for a given platform/device/OS will vary. Sometimes this restriction is due to a technical issue, for example, the missing core may require access to a library or driver that is not available on your device (e.g., the lack of OpenGL support is why there is no N64 core for the PS3 or Wii versions of RetroArch). Other times, it's related to performance. For instance, you cannot emulate NDS games on a PSP.\n\nNotably: citra-libretro is not available on Xbox, and there are no functional PS2 cores for Android or Apple devices (iOS, tvOS or macOS) at the time of this writing.",
            "Q: Can I use RetroArch's netplay to trade Pokemans with my friends?\n\nA: ~~No.~~ Maybe. RetroArch's netplay simulates 2 players on a single console. For most handhelds, imagine 2 people fighting over the same console. The exception to this is original Game Boy / Color via TGB-Dual or Sameboy cores, which can do link cable over netplay by running 2 instances of the console on each end and then syncing between them. PSP wifi netplay is also possible via PPSSPP's own netplay implementation, which can be accessed via the core options.\n\n**Update (2/4/2024):** gpSP-libretro now emulates the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which allows [some games (including Pokemon Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen)](https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Game_Boy_Advance_games_with_wireless_compatibility) to connect via netplay. See [this blog post](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-1-17-new-netplay-features/) for more details.",
            "Q: My games don't show up. (or \"Scanning/importing content adds some games but misses others\")\n\nA: If you mean they're not being added to playlists when you scan, that just means they don't match our databases of known-good dumps, based mostly on No-Intro and Redump hashes. Those groups do not track things like bad/incomplete dumps (like ROMs you've had on your hard drive since the '90s) or ROMhacks/translations, so those are not going to show up. Some of our databases are also incomplete and just may not include an obscure game or revision (or one from a weird region). It's not a big deal, though, as you can just use the manual scan instead, which will skip the database check and add literally anything to a playlist",
            "Q: Which is the best core for ... ?\n\nA: There is almost never a single \"best\" core for all use-cases, so we can't usually make a good recommendation. However, if you go to the core downloader and press retropad-select while hovering over a core, it will pop up a description blurb that includes information about the core, including how it compares with other cores that cover the same games/console/platform so you can make an informed decision for your use-case.",
            "Q: I'm having trouble with arcade games and their emulators, like MAME and FBNeo.\n\nA: Please read the documentation on arcade emulation, as it will probably clear everything up for you: [https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started/](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started/) Arcade emulation is very different from console emulation and can be daunting for the uninitiated.",
            "Q: In the Android Play Store, should I install regular RetroArch or the \"Plus\" version? What's the difference?\n\nA: Neither, actually. As of Android v11, Google has mandated that all apps in the Play Store need to implement support for their \"scoped storage\" API, and anyone who doesn't (or in our case, can't) do so can no longer update their apps. As a result, the RetroArch apps on the Play Store are either years out of date or scam clones.\n\nInstead, you should download it [from our website](https://retroarch.com/?page=platforms) and \"sideload\" it (that is, install it manually without using a storefront) or get it from any of the other storefronts not controlled by Google where we have a presence (e.g., Amazon, Samsung, LG, F-Droid).\n\nWhy not just remove those crusty old apps from the Play Store and avoid the confusion, you ask? Well, they still technically work just fine, and removing them would remove the only free option a lot of people worldwide have to play a number of different games/consoles, leaving only for-pay and/or scam/adware apps for anyone who isn't savvy enough to sideload. So, it's the lesser of two evils, basically.\n\nNow, back to the original question: the \"Plus\" version has more cores available but will not run on very old Android devices, while the regular version works all the way back to 4.4 KitKat (I think?). This distinction is also a result of us working around Google's goofy policies and is not required on other storefronts, hence the \"Plus\" version only existing on the Play Store.",
            "Q: My game is broken/won't launch/looks weird in dolphin-libretro!\n\nA: Did you do the required setup for the core? [https://docs.libretro.com/library/dolphin/#setup](https://docs.libretro.com/library/dolphin/#setup) This is where the emulator stores its settings/hacks for performance/compatibility purposes and many games have compatibility issues if it's not available and in the correct location. The core system files downloader will automatically put them where you need them.\n\nMany other common issues (such as crashing) are solved by switching away from the default \"gl\" video driver. In Windows, d3d11 is a good alternative, while in Linux, glcore and vulkan are both good and YMMV.",
            "Q: Whenever I change inputs (like swapping B and A to match my controller's labels), it changes them for every core!\n\nA: That usually means you're changing your retropad mapping ([https://docs.libretro.com/guides/input-and-controls/#what-is-a-retropad](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/input-and-controls/#what-is-a-retropad)) in settings > input instead of changing the core mapping in quick menu > controls.",
            "Q: RetroArch can't see games on my Android device's microSD card!\n\nA: Yes, this is a known issue caused by Google's \"scoped storage\" requirement, implemented in Android v11. There's no solution for it currently, though you can use RetroArch in conjunction with a launcher, such as Dig or Launchbox, to load games from removable storage."

            "A few tips for Retroarch on iOS. \n\nIf you try to load a rom and the app crashes. Use a different core. This issue is exclusive to the apple version of Retroarch. Use psxrearmed for ps1. Use mgba for gba. Use Genisis plus gx (not wide) for sega gen games. These are all I tested so far. \n\n1.) If you want to save yourself some annoyances with Retroarch on iOS, then after you make a change to your settings, hit home, select configuration file, then save configuration file. I choose the overwrite option, but you can choose what best fits you. We can do this on other platforms by just tapping the back button until it exits the application, but there isn\u2019t a back button on iOS. \n\n2.) I also like to go to turn on vibration/ haptic feedback. Go to settings, input and scroll down to haptic feedback. I turn both options on and leave the vibration strength at 100%. \n\n3.) I like to change the user interface. You can do this in two ways. A.) Changing the theme. Go to settings, user interface, appearance, select color theme and then choose your favorite. Mine is material ui dark. A.1) If you want you can also choose another app icon. The setting is the first option under user interface. B.) I like the stock setup, but you can change the entire layout to be different. You can go to settings, drivers, and select menu. The stock option is glui. You can choose the option you like the best in this section. \n\n4.) I like to change the date and time format at the top to be something I am more used to. Go to settings, user interface, menu item visibility and select \u201cstyle of date and time\u201d towards the end of the list. \n\n5.) Then we get to importing content. In the iOS version, all the usable cores seem to be downloaded in Retroarch already. So that is nice, but you have to select the correct core when booting a rom. I don\u2019t know if I am doing it correctly, so correct me if I am wrong. But retroarch likes the roms to be placed into a folder that is inside of the Retroarch app itself. Seems to be like this on android as well. So what I do is take the roms I want to play on Retroarch and move them into the Retroarch app. Here is how I do that. I have a folder already on my iPhone with the roms I want to play. I use the files app to locate this folder. Then I select it and move it. Or you could copy it. Then move or paste it inside of the Retroarch app folder under downloads. Then hit the playlist menu (middle navigation button.) and select import content. Then scan directory. Click documents/retroarch, scroll down to downloads, then select scan this directory. Then let it do its thing. After it is done you can come back to the playlist menu to look for and launch your games. \n\n6.) Updates. Don\u2019t know how necessary it is, but I like to make sure a few things are up to date. So I hit the home menu at the bottom. Go to online updater. Make sure on demand thumbnails is toggled on. Then just below that update core files all the way down to slang shaders. Then scroll back up to playlist thumbnail updater and select any that are missing album art. Or just select them all to make sure they do when you browse your roms. If you want some free to use roms go to content downloader and some homebrew and other roms are in there for each system. \n\nAfter you are done changing anything. Do not just close the app. Make sure you save the configuration file like I mentioned at the start of this post. If not, the settings you changed will be \u201cforgotten\u201d but the roms and art should still be there. \n\nIf there are any mistakes in this post, please feel free to correct me. I typed this out on my phone at my kitchen table while my kids cleaned up after dinner. So take everything with a grain of salt. Hope it helps someone out there.",
            "I am totally blind and I am able to use RetroArch thanks to the accessibility they have put into the PC and Mac versions.
