        "content": "# \"Is Cities: Skylines II Worth It?\" \ud83e\udd14\n\n... is one of the most common questions we see on the subreddit at the moment, leading to dozens of duplicate posts asking essentially the same thing: Should I buy the game or not?\n\nIt is our intent that this megathread will help collect information to help you make your decision, and provide a place to ask for more subjective opinions from community members. \n\n## General FAQs\n\nIf you're after general information about or help with the game (e.g. features, minimum or recommended specs, the situation related to modding, when the game will release on consoles), check out our wiki articles below. They'll provide you a decent base level of knowledge and help you understand more about the features and limitations of the game.\n\n- [Getting Started](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_gettingstarted_cs2)\n- [Common Gameplay Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_gameplay_cs2/) \n- [Hardware Advice](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_hardware_cs2)\n- [Downloadable Content (DLC)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_dlc_cs2)\n- [Modding and Custom Content](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/faq_modding_cs2)\n\n## Patches and Bug Fixes\n\nAs of 2023-05-01 there have been 10 patches for the game. These patches have included over 400 changes to the base game. These include both major changes (addition of LOD models for citizens, introduction of modding support) and minor changes (updates to localisation text). You can review the change log for each patch below: \n\n* **1.0.11f1 (2023-10-26):** [9 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.11f1)\n* **1.0.12f1 (2023-11-02):** [17 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.12f1)\n* **1.0.13f1 (2023-11-09):** [18 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.13f1)\n* **1.0.14f1 (2023-11-16):** [21 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.14f1)\n* **1.0.15f1 (2023-12-01):** [46 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.15f1)\n* **1.0.18f1 (2023-12-14):** [42 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.18f1)\n* **1.0.19f1 (2024-01-31):** [63 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.0.X#1.0.19f1)\n* **1.1.0f1 (2024-03-25):**  [65 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.0f1)\n* **1.1.1f1 (2024-04-02):** [12 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.1f1)\n* **1.1.2f1 (2024-04-25):** [107 row change log](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Patch_1.1.X#1.1.2f1)\n\n**_OK, but have those patches actually changed anything?_**\n\nCommunity member /u/Safe-Economics-3224 created a benchmark in the weeks after launch and has continued to post results after each patch has released. These give a good indication as to how performance has improved over the life of the game so far:\n\n- [1.0.12f1 (2023-11-02)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17o8ke7/created_a_benchmark_to_accurately_measure/)\n- [1.0.13f1 (2023-11-09)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17syube/patch_1013f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.14f1 (2023-11-16)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17ygxuj/patch_1014f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.15f1 (2023-12-01)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/188zho8/patch_1015f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.18f1 (2023-12-14)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/18kccdb/patch_1018f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n- [1.0.19f1 (2024-01-31)](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/1agy7ei/patch_1019f1_hotfix_updated_benchmark_results_and/)\n\nUnfortunately, /u/Safe-Economics-3224 has gone quiet since this the 1.0.19f1 patch and we've not been able to identify another reliable source of consistent benchmarking results. Big thanks to /u/Safe-Economics-3224 for all of the great work they did on behalf of this community.\n\n## What have the devs been saying?\n\nThe main channel of \"formal\" communication from the developers comes via the Word of the Week blog post shared each Monday by the Colossal Order CEO in the Paradox Forums. We maintain an accompanying megathread which captures a lot of player feedback and reactions to the news shared each week. \n\nAs these are shared weekly, the best way to catch up on past posts is to browse the [Dev Diary flair](https://reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ADev%2BDiary) and dip into the more recent ones. Unfortunately, this link won't work on Reddit's mobile apps (please [tell Reddit if you'd like this fixed](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=23708886396180)) but in the meantime you can go to the main page of the subreddit and use the \"filter by flair\" options provided.\n\n## Live Gameplay Videos\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how the game is playing today, you can check out recent videos or streams from YouTube and Twitch. These will show you the \"real\" game, not marketing videos. As there is only limited mod support for the game at this stage, what you see will _broadly_ be vanilla gameplay and will help you understand how the game is performing at the moment.\n\n- [Cities: Skylines II game page on YouTube, sorted by Recent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVM37E_mrP2kufE8Uu-YOSg/recent)\n- [Cities: Skylines II category page on Twitch, sorted by Recent](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/cities-skylines-ii?sort=RECENT)\n\n## Reviews\n\nMany critic reviews aren't necessarily reflective of the _current_ state of the game. That said, reviews are helpful sources of information to help you decide whether or not to drop your cash on any new game, not just Cities: Skylines II.\n\n- [Metacritic Page](https://www.metacritic.com/game/cities-skylines-ii/) (includes both critic and player reviews)\n- [Steam Review Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash) (you may wish to use the provided filters to show more recent reviews)\n- [Microsoft Review Page](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/cities-skylines-ii-pc-edition/9PGZ346PSLN0) (you may wish to sort by \"recent\")\n\n## Try Before you Buy\n\nIf you're still unsure, Cities: Skylines II is available on Microsoft Game Pass for PC, which is a subscription service at a much lower monthly cost than the full retail price of the game. Microsoft is currently offering an initial 14-day trial for as low as \u00a31/$1/1\u20ac (which renews at full price after the 14 days).\n\n- [US$1 Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0)\n- [\u00a31 Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass)\n- [1\u20ac Game Pass Trial](https://www.xbox.com/en-IE/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0) (this link goes to the Xbox Ireland store, check the local Xbox site for your country before proceding)\n\n## Refunds \n\nIf for any reason you can't make use of a discounted Game Pass for PC subscription (i.e. it may not be available in your region), you have the option of purchasing the game and refunding it within the store's refund window.\n\n- **Steam:** Request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven't accrued more than **2 hours of total playtime** \n- **Microsoft Store:** Request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven't accrued \"a significant amount of play time\"\n\nRecognising that you may not be able to reach the \"late game\" within 2 hours, you can use [this 100k benchmarking city](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17fg7z9/benchmark_your_pc_using_this_100k_population/) to establish whether or not you're comfortable with the performance on your system.\n\n## Specific Questions\n\nIf you've got specific questions about items not covered in these FAQs, feel free to ask them below.

            "I have the game but haven't opened it since launch.  Are there any mods yet to change the look of the game?  When I see screenshots the lighting is always weird and bland.  Like overcast but with hard shadows.  It doesn't look right to me.  I saw someone play a desert map and it was way too saturated.",
            "Yes, but not to play hundreds of hours. \nCommunity assets are missing and that for me the only thing missing now. \nParadox mods sucks. Every time I launch the game I have to wait for mods update, close the game, reopen, reclose the game. Then sometimes it works, sometimes it\u2019s not. Well big crap.",
            "After a few month i gave it a second shot. With mods there are more option to fix some \"bugs\". However, after a few weeks i'm tired of all the crashes (every time i play the game it crashes at least once), the bugs (super weird bugs), the traffic (no chance of doing something against ist), the performance (with 4080, 64gb ram and i7 i play with super ugly textures and my GPU is at 95% ). Its really frustrating as i really want to have fun. But it's more off a me cussing in front of my PC instead of having fun. I really hope they'll fixing it",
            "If this game gets itself fixed up soon then it's worth it, if they start spamming out dlc, then no, it won't be worth it.",
            "My game literally won\u2019t load with mods but without is fine",
            "A lot of the answers in here are just being intentionally pessimistic. I think if anyone is looking *right now* and considering, wait a tiny bit longer and check again. They'll be releasing the economy rework (among a few other things) in the next week or two, which might make a substantial difference in a lot of the gameplay issues. There's still a lot of other stuff they need to address afterward, but you won't have to wait long to see if it makes a difference.",
            "Not really, the game is bland and boring outside of the bugs.  This company kind of shot themselves in the foot not changing engines and making the game look and feel better than the first game.  It would have been far better to take the old game and just offer and upgrade along with the 100s of dollars in expansions we already bought along with it.",
            "If you haven't purchased it yet, you could probably hold off a little longer and wait until a game of the year version or a big sale.",
            "I am waiting until they finish the game. It seems to me everyone who brought CS2 brought a beta. I just got CS1 and it is crazy to have 43 DLC's so far and I guess one more is coming Landmark Buildings which I see when I open the gave in a window above my listed DLC's.",
            "No. It hasn't been and still it's not."
