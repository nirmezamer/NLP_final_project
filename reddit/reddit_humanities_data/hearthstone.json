It is designed so that everybody may ask any and all questions regarding the game's mechanics, decks, strategies and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep it clean and try to add more than just a one or two word response. As the goal of this post is to increase the community's knowledge, the thought process matters as much as the answer! There is also a PullsDay Thursday weekly post, for those who want to share their pulled packs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Sticky Threads and Guides - Great resources for new players!\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/resources#wiki\\_sticky\\_threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/resources#wiki_sticky_threads))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I am a bot.

            "I started playing about a month ago and just hit legend for the first time, what are some tips on how to improve more? I feel like playing ranked will only get me so far as I am surely making lots of mistakes but don't know how to identify them",
            "Hi there i have three questions :)\n\nAfter you get all the minisets as a new player which packs should you get the one from the expansion you like or from the latest set.\n\nSecondly after the recent update my shop seems to be closed does anything know how to fix this i play on pc.\n\nLastly how do i get a reddit avatar.",
            "Hi, just started the game and I was reading that u get a legendary for the first 10 packs you buy.\n\nI opened a legendary from one of the free packs from the apprentice track, does it count? Or do I still get a confirmed legendary if I buy 10 packs from the store?",
            "Hi just got into Hearthstone the other week, for some reason I was under the impression that a new expansion is released every year. But we have an upcoming expansion this July, so just wondering how often do expansions release? Would also like to ask how often seasons refresh as well. Thanks! :D",
            "Would it be better to save the standard red packs for a chance of getting cards from future expansion?",
            "Does anyone know how long buddies will be in battlegrounds?",
            "How should I start building a collection and making somewhat decent deck as a returning player? Seems hard at the moment to figure out what to pick or be able to get good cards",
            "I recently started playing hearthstone again, just battlegrounds for now \n\nIs there no way for me to get older bartenders? Is the only way to get new ones is by buying the battle pass? Same goes for the strike animations?",
            "How long is Genn and Baku in standard?",
            "Came back to the game about 2 months ago after a few years break. Just wanted to say. As a f2p player that only plays one class. I dust all of the cards from other ones to keep up with new stuff. This new expansion literally kills the game for me. Sad times, It's been fun while it lasted. Gonna miss this community."
