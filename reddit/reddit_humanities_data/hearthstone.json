            "Reinstalled after 4-5 years, played for a day and a half and reached legend EUW(6400 ish). What is weird to me is that you dont see the ranks of your opponents. Might as well be playing bronze players (there were some really bad ones). A lot of people roping every turn and stil misplaying. Way too much RNG in my opinion and some crazy high powerlevel of the cards themselfes. I think i will uninstall again. Maybe some ppl who actually enjoy this hearthstone can elaborate why they like this game?",
            "I picked the plague dk as my returning deck. I seem to have lesser than 40% wr and am stuck right now. Anyone have an alternative plague dk to recommend? I do not have much spending or crafting powers. Roughly 2k to 3k dust.",
            "Im a returning player, what should i buy as a low spender ?",
            "Im a bit out of the loop. \n\nWhat was the combos that made Celestial projectionist nerfed?",
            "Hi! I played a bit of Hearthstone at the release in 2014, then picked it up again in 2016, during Old Gods. Really played it hardcore for a year, played pretty much every deck that existed at the time (anyfin paladin, c'thun warrior, token druid, midrange cotw hunter, 4 mana 7/7 shaman, dragon priest, og Reno decks, miracle rogue, freeze mage etc etc). Then after Gadgetzan release, I lost interest and at some point just left completely. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I got the itch to play again. Did the returning player quests, tried out all loaner decks - stumbled my way from bronze to gold with wishing well rogue, then had to switch to plague DK and claimed the DK deck as well. Was annoyed by handbuff paladins, so decided to just craft the deck and got to plat with it in one day. It's pretty OP imo and feels nice when you're not on the receiving end of it. However, I've always liked OTK and combo decks (Freeze Mage was my favorite deck even after Mad Scientist rotated out). And here is my question:\n\nIs there a competitive deck now that plays similar to the old Freeze Mage? I liked having to assemble the pieces of my combo while trying to stay alive. Maybe there are some newer variations of combo/otk decks? I tried looking at the different deck lists at hsreplay and d0nkey but I'm struggling to see how these decks play and not sure if I'd enjoy their play style (like Wishing Well rogue was fun but I hated the fact that I have to rely on random discoveries as my win condition). Would love any advice, thanks!",
            "New player here. I am about the select my loan deck. I am very enjoying Wishing for win Rouge Deck. I would like to pick that one but after expansion release in a month, do I lose any of card? Is there a any card that goes to wild in next expansion?",
            "Im a returning player and i have a cross platform syncing issue. Ive downloaded the game both on mobile and on pc, on mobile first if it matters cz i wasnt home atm, ive logged both instances to the same account but the progress isnt the same. The username is the same, the friends list, its the same account, but with two different progress saves it seems. The pc one gave me some rewards for being a returning player and whatnot but the mobile one started me off fresh so ideally i would like the mobile one to take on the pc ones data, but even the other way around works, as long as i can progress on both devices",
            "I enjoyed playing Murlocs years ago, but they seem extremely ineffective now. Is there anything remotely viable I can do in standard with Murlocs? I understand they aren't meta and am fine with losing, but is there any Murloc deck that feels like a slight handicap rather and an insurmountable one?",
            "Hey y'all! I used to play a lot and I've been legend before. I saw a video of mill druid. Is it playable (like over 40% winrate)? Is it worth crafting given the new expansion release date (no idea when this is, or when new sets come out)",
            "I havent played this game since the grand tournament expansion. Just made legend in standard going to try to climb wild any decent cheap decks for wild?"
