            "He\u2019s stated on several streams that he\u2019s super open and accepting, and he shuts down any homophobia etc IMMEDIATELY. There was also a stream where he was doing a silly wizard RP and another random called him (or just said it in general I forgot) the f slur, and he quickly became very down and stopped the RP, and moved somewhere else in the game map. He talked to chat then as well about not accepting that shit in the slightest",
            "from what ive observed, its mainly bc of the fact that he makes his community safe and open for everyone. he automatically comes across as very chill and respectful just from the ways that he communicates and interacts generally."
