            "Not many. We will apply any discounts or incentives, and we don\u2019t do markups, but we e aren\u2019t discounting vehicles thousands of bucks to get them moving. We are a tiny dealership in Texas though, so we don\u2019t meet the high volume criteria",
            "What any given dealer does is completely up to how their sales look, inventory, and their projections. There's no way to arbitrarily list ones that do any one thing regularly.",
            "I did not, which is my fault, however they never asked me to either. I did ask if I needed a down payment and they said no.",
            "How exactly did the order process go then? When we ordered a new Transit for our business we pretty much signed all the normal paperwork making the vehicle ours from the beginning. When it arrived we went in and finished off any remaining paperwork and were done.",
            "We went through the configuration tool at the dealership together, they printed off the final order form for me, and I got the typical Ford status update emails about the build date/in production/shipped/delivered/ etc. So it was def an order in my name and not just a dealership inventory order. But they didn\u2019t require money down or me to sign anything and said if I refused it it would be fine cause they would be able to sell it quickly. I specific asked about that when I asked if they needed down payment. Since you were ordering for a business/fleet it may have been handled differently. It is what it is now, just need to find another dealership that will give me the truck at invoice or below.",
            "Ah sorry man. Unfortunately it sounds like you dealt with scummy salesman/sales managers to do that to you. They panicked and saw a bird in the hand. Good luck on your search. I think the market has leveled out enough that most dealerships are selling under invoice at least in Southern NJ."

I don\u2019t have to commute to much for work but I have been able to run my TIG welder off the 240v system in the truck and cranked it up to 225amps and she ran it no problem! I have had little to no issues with the truck only a crappy stock battery which I upgraded to a more long life larger one from batteries plus. My rims are method machined aluminum 17\u201d with a zero offset, I\u2019m running 35\u201d BFG ko2 tires and have been shocked with how good the ride is with no road noise at all \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb. The truck is a lariat 502a package with FX4 and I can say the 4x4 on it is amazing gotten me out of snow and mud easily. I\u2019ve had a few recalls but nothing the local dealership didn\u2019t handle quickly and easily! It has given me zero problems and has been by far the best vehicle I\u2019ve owned and I have no intention of getting rid of it. Just made my last payment of the loan so she\u2019s all mine now, wanted to see what people thought about the truck. Looking for a nice front and rear bumper to give me dual exhaust in the rear and some more clearance in the front! Any suggestions? ",
