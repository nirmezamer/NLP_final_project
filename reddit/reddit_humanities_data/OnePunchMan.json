            "Careful, Flashy. Your tsundere is showing.\n\nEmpty Void is definitely seeming a lot cooler. He's a goofball at times, but I like that.\n\nAnd I'm liking this sassy Obi Wan energy from Blast!",
            "This was truly our Ninjutsu Kaisen\n\nI like this current version of Empty Void\u2019s design more than the one we saw in the flashback",
            "Man this version does such a better job of showing void off. We got a really interesting depiction of how the dimensional slash works and both flash and sonic get to have their respective moments in their defensive.",
            "Blast deadass said \ud83d\ude1b",
            "Blast panicking because he lost track of Flash is peak OPM lmao.",
            "I love how Blast was showing he wasn't just a 'badass' in this chapter, and is just a silly guy. It's so funny with his \ud83d\ude1b and his bulging eyes. He's really not beating the Joseph Joestar accusations \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "I like the duo and giving each something they are better at, Flashy with skills that are above and Sonic solid conviction to not be tempted. It's a nice touch for this pair of tsundere friends.\n\nBlast vs ninja dude is gonna be epic. Lots of dimension and what ever scifi stuff they will cook up.",
            "Empty Void feels way stronger and more threatening in these redraws. I also really like his monstrous appearance in this chapter. The bit of extra characterization with Flashy and emotional dependence is great too. Overall a definite improvement.",
            "Blast coming in like a professor proud of his 2 best students passing the final exam."
