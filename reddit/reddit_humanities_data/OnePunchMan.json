            "Man this version does such a better job of showing void off. We got a really interesting depiction of how the dimensional slash works and both flash and sonic get to have their respective moments in their defensive.",
            "I love how Blast was showing he wasn't just a 'badass' in this chapter, and is just a silly guy. It's so funny with his \ud83d\ude1b and his bulging eyes. He's really not beating the Joseph Joestar accusations \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "Blast panicking because he lost track of Flash is peak OPM lmao.",
            "I like the duo and giving each something they are better at, Flashy with skills that are above and Sonic solid conviction to not be tempted. It's a nice touch for this pair of tsundere friends.\n\nBlast vs ninja dude is gonna be epic. Lots of dimension and what ever scifi stuff they will cook up.",
            "Empty Void feels way stronger and more threatening in these redraws. I also really like his monstrous appearance in this chapter. The bit of extra characterization with Flashy and emotional dependence is great too. Overall a definite improvement.",
            "Blast coming in like a professor proud of his 2 best students passing the final exam.",
            "Void\u2019s conversation with flash/sonic reminds of Sage Centipede\u2019s conversation with metal bat and garou LOL",

        "content": "So we all know Pig God's powers and abilities, and the fact he has a secret move that is very powerful but that could cost him his own life.\nI have a theory for all this: I believe some time back, he swallowed some sort of black hole, that managed to 'sit' in his stomach and enhanced his already digestive/swallowing capabilities enormously. This is why PG can never find satisfaction, no matter how much he eats. \nHis secret move consists of regurgitating/vomiting the black hole thing, which will start absorbing everything around it in a mile radious, including PG.\nThis is obviously dangerous for him and his allies, hence his hesitation in using it and wait 'for the very end'.",

            "I\u2019ve heard the black hole theory before, but if that were the case I don\u2019t understand how he keeps packing on mass. If he were always skinny while eating like he does, I could see this theory being more believable.",
            "My theory is that Pig God's ultimate move is that he'll swallow anything he can until he dies",
            "i actually really fuck with this theory",
            "He doesn\u2019t just go super saiyan he flat out turns into goku",
            "Yeah probably this. \n\nApparently converting 1 kilogram of mass into pure energy is like detonating a 21 megatons bomb, so it would be pretty epic if PG did it with all his excess weight.",
            "That's my way to explain his 'powers'. The black hole enhanced them. Of course I'm speculating, we know very little about PG anyway, but it would be disappointing if his ultimate move is just him turning a ripped, stronger version of Tank Top Master or Dark Shine, we've seen that before already.",
            "I think PG as already that big before, the black hole would just stay in his stomach without harming its host, but demanding a constant supply of things to devour."
