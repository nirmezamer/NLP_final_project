I have an advisor willing to follow me that I really like but I can't find funding. I have multiple interviews, am filling files, but it looks like i'm fucked. It sucks. I'm so close to getting there but so far away at the same time.",
            "Ups: Defending tomorrow. Got my first official job offer too, so things are looking up.\n\nDowns: I do not feel prepared for my defense. I stand by my work, but I am sorta checked out at this point. I spent more time writing a review paper and applying to jobs than preparing for my defense, so I worry I will end up embarrassing myself. Nonetheless, I doubt I will fail my defense.",
            "I feel like all my phd was a failure between my PI that knows less than I do and so care like 0 and the coauthors that try to make sense of what I get from my data and my PI weird ideas",
            "Ups: Finally doing my proposal defence this week.\n\n  \nDowns: My supervisor scheduled the defence the same day as a conference presentation so I'll have to rush to the conference after the meeting. My other supervisor specifically asked for a copy of my proposal to review before the meeting (they haven't looked at the last two versions they received) which made me think he was actually going to give me some useful feedback. Instead, he did what he normally does and responded to my email about something that has nothing to do with my proposal and then ended it by pointing out really obvious things like the fact that I should have some slides ready in case I need them. (The proposal and presentation were all done 2 years ago and have been regularly updated since...)",
            "If I simply sacrifice every source of joy and happiness in my life and lock in for the next few months, I can publish this paper and graduate. \n\n  \n\\*doesn't publish. \\*doesn't graduate \\*gets more depressed.",
            "Up: I got the go ahead for my PhD proposal (qual prep) and have an incredibly supportive committee which feels rare. \n\nDown: I am feel incredibly unmotivated other life things have curbed my capacity to show up."

        "content": "I'm in the UK and started my PhD late 2017, funded via the ESRC. I had been diagnosed that year with a psychosis condition + cPTSD and was still struggling with controlling it when I applied and got the PhD. I don't know what I was thinking.\n\nI then lost access to my data in the week when first lockdowns were announced in 2020. I was meant to be handing in at the end of 2020 and coupled with the shit psychosis stuff, I nearly left the whole thing. This turned into nearly a year of waiting and finally I had the decision to either pack the PhD in completly, or find a new direction.\n\nI found new data and finally handed in Dec 2022 and sat viva mid 2023. I got some minor corrections and handed them in earlier this year. I got my final acknowledgement that it's all accepted and done last week. I'm now completely done and don't really know how to feel? I struggled with the psychosis and poor MH without family support during it, who also didn't understand the PhD situation (first-gen, working-class). I also struggled with feeling like a failure because it took me so long (it's usually 3-4 years to complete in the UK). This sub was very helpful to lurk on during it though!\n\nSo I just wanted to post somewhere. I'm done and I can't believe it. ",

He couldn't go to the clinic in the afternoon because he was working.\n\nHe'd completed his PhD whilst living with a long term psychotic condition and I always admired him for it. I used to sometimes think of him during my own PhD struggles. \n\nHuge congratulations to you. It's a tough road to travel.",
            "It sounds like you had a really tough PhD journey. Im doing my PhD in the UK as well and started it since May 2018. Ill likely submit in the next few weeks. \n\nMy point is that you are not alone in this, and definitely not a failure for submitting after the 4-year mark! Ive struggled with these feelings as well but I try to remind myself that every PhD journey is just so different, and you cant really make fair comparisons. And its a very lonely journey too, nobody can truly understand what you may be going through. \n\nThe important thing is that despite all these difficulties, you persevered, submitted and passed. Congrats Dr!"

The job said they\u2019d allow me to transition into part time during the school year, the only issue is that I either TA or tutor ~15 hours/wk during the school year + I am a research assistant with my professor this fall. My stipend is pennies and the city I live in has such a high cost of living so I could really use the additional income during the school year. The non profit job is very flexible and would allow me to work ~3 days a week on a hybrid/virtual schedule. The added bonus is always having a secure full time job during breaks. I would still be taking classes full time (9 credits) as well. Is this is a bad idea?

At any rate, its usually frowned upon to have a job outside of your degree program stipend unless if its been cleared by your primary supervisor first, given that PhD students typically dont have the time to do anything else aside from taking classes, TAing, and trying to get their dist project off the ground; especially by year two.
