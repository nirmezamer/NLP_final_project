            "Ups: Finally doing my proposal defence this week.\n\n  \nDowns: My supervisor scheduled the defence the same day as a conference presentation so I'll have to rush to the conference after the meeting. My other supervisor specifically asked for a copy of my proposal to review before the meeting (they haven't looked at the last two versions they received) which made me think he was actually going to give me some useful feedback. Instead, he did what he normally does and responded to my email about something that has nothing to do with my proposal and then ended it by pointing out really obvious things like the fact that I should have some slides ready in case I need them. (The proposal and presentation were all done 2 years ago and have been regularly updated since...)",
            "I sent a chapter today! 3 down, 3 to go! I'm halfway to my first draft!!",
            "Up: I found a topic to start my PhD\n\nDown: I'm looking forward to start a PhD in Architecture next year. (France). I have an advisor willing to follow me that I really like but I can't find funding. I have multiple interviews, am filling files, but it looks like i'm fucked. It sucks. I'm so close to getting there but so far away at the same time.",
            "Ups: Defending tomorrow. Got my first official job offer too, so things are looking up.\n\nDowns: I do not feel prepared for my defense. I stand by my work, but I am sorta checked out at this point. I spent more time writing a review paper and applying to jobs than preparing for my defense, so I worry I will end up embarrassing myself. Nonetheless, I doubt I will fail my defense.",
            "I feel like all my phd was a failure between my PI that knows less than I do and so care like 0 and the coauthors that try to make sense of what I get from my data and my PI weird ideas",

            "I haven\u2019t seen this much but this is likely very country-dependent. \nIn the Philippines for example, I see this attitude a lot. \nBut for example in Canada, Germany, Serbia, and many other European countries, the stigma is reversed. The stigma is that if you go to a private school, it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t good enough to get into the free/cheap public schools, so now you have to pay for your education at a private school lol",
            "I haven\u2019t really noticed this in this sub specifically, but yeah I agree that sucks if that\u2019s a trend. Different fields are stronger at different universities, and many times one department in a public university will be way stronger than the same field at an Ivy. There are many amazing public universities like Berkeley, UNC, UCLA, University of Texas, Michigan, UMass, UVA, the list goes on. All top tier universities, and some leaders in the world in specific fields.\n\nYes, private schools dominate the rankings, which is where I\u2019m sure much of the stereotype comes from, but having gone to an Ivy myself for one of my graduate degrees, the first lesson I learned is not to believe the hype. Sure, the Ivies are great schools, but they\u2019re not some mystically majestic above-all institutions. They\u2019re just schools.\n\nSorry it seems you\u2019ve seen some prejudice here. Any graduate student should know better.",
            "It plays into that idea of feeling exclusive and being able to gatekeep higher education. The obsession with the ivy leagues here in the U.S. is rampant. There are plenty of stellar advisors and programs at public universities. It's a red flag to me when a PhD at any phase puts a lot of emphasis on being at a private/ivy institution.",
            "Funnily, it's kind of opposite in Germany.",
            "I saw a post earlier today with someone obsessing over not having gone to a top 10/elite school for their phd despite working at one of those schools currently. On the one hand I felt bad for them, but on the other it\u2019s that kind of mentality that contributes to the problem. \n\nI get it. I was at an Ivy League at one point. I thought it would be amazing. It was one of the most miserable and lonely year of my life. Switched programs to a public school in the Midwest. Million times happier now than when I was at an \u201celite\u201d institute.",

        "content": "Hello PhD'ers!\n\nI graduated 3 years ago with a PhD from a t50 school and have constant regret that I did not go to a better school-- like a t10 school. The irony is, I currently work for one of the most elite universities, and now since I see the level of experience (or lack thereof) of the students that get in, I realize that could have been me. However, I never applied to a t10 school. I am FILLED with regret constantly that I never applied. I do not know what to do to make me feel better. I thought about getting a master's from a t10 school, but it doesn't hit the same. It's silly, I know, but I feel left out since many of my colleagues are alum of these prestigious 'name brand' universities and I just can't relate. Outside of my colleagues, my friends have way bigger reactions when they meet someone who graduated with a PhD from a t10 school. When they ask where I went to school, my friends either have never heard of my school or aren't nearly as impressed. \n\nHas anyone felt the same? If so, have you done anything about it?",

            "I regret choosing a big name school over somewhere I would have gotten more individual attention from PIs, lived in a city that I knew I liked, and not felt like I was constantly in competition with people who thought they were God's gift to science. For the past 6 years I've been trapped in a place that I hate, in a work culture that's made me lose all passion for my work. Obviously there are advantages, but in my field they're much smaller than I thought they would be. If I could go back and make a different choice, I would do it in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nBut more importantly, I can't go back and neither can you. We both have to do what we can with the situations we are in. As many others have suggested, if you find that these thoughts are getting in the way of living your life, seek therapy.",
            "Being employed by an elite university is a lot more important than graduating from one of them.  If you have such constant regret that it is affecting your quality of life, you should consider getting some counseling to help you grapple with the immutability of the past and the value you place on the perceptions of others.",
            "I can relate. I\u2019ve done all my education in public state institutions, and I\u2019m about to start a postdoc this fall at a private institution that heavily draws phds from the Ivy League schools. It\u2019s a strange feeling (especially seeing how much money they have compared to my state schools). \n\nSometimes I wish I went to a fancy school, but I value my experience in the public education system. I find solidarity with my fellow state schoolers at conferences and I think it\u2019s given me a better, more grounded perspective of academia.",

Dr. Suess's old: \"Those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter.\" It doesn't sound like this regert is serving you anything but grief, so allow yourself a reasonable time to grieve and then let it go. If it really bothers you that much, then go get another one at a t10. If that sounds ridiculous, then frame the context of your regret in that ridiculousness.",

Most people outside of the state has never heard of it, and I could honestly care less.\u00a0I make good money in industry and only care about my total compensation and work life balance.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have so much regret, you could always get a MD or JD degree in a T10. I know people who went back to school for those degrees after getting a PhD. And your friends will definitely give you a bigger reaction if you were a MD/PhD or a JD/PhD rather than only a PhD.\u00a0",
            ">I feel left out since many of my colleagues are alum of these prestigious 'name brand' universities and I just can't relate\n\nWell, now all of you are *colleagues* at your prestigious university! And unless your colleagues mostly come from one school then they shouldn't relate that much - I wouldn't expect a Princeton alum to automatically have some innate connection with an MIT alum.\n\n>my friends have way bigger reactions when they meet someone who graduated with a PhD from a t10 school\n\nUnless you plan to make this a significant part of your personality then it's not a big deal. People give a reaction and then everyone moves on."
