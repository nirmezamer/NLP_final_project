            "\\# Aliexpress - Comet Crash Global Store (April 19 - April 30)\n\n* (389$) AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3d\n\nI know this isn't a Canadian retailer, but with the Aliexpress sales being so prevalent now and people having questions, I'd like to post this here. (Feel free to remove if needed)\n\nThe processor is working perfectly. Booted first go, no issues. Took my RAM's EXPO with no issues. Slowly working on a negative curve (-10 now, will do -20 if stable). This is a real processor. It works.\n\nThere are still some things you need to know about :\n\n\\- This is a tray CPU. These CPU are meant for OEMs to build systems with, and so you have no warranty to fall back to if the CPU is bad. This is a risk you take in exchange for the big discount you get, but CPUs aren't really prone to failing, so that was a risk I was willing to take. (And I had a defective 6700k back in the day !)\n\n\\- The sales last a week usually, so give people a few hours, they'll figure out the best code combos.\n\n\\- It might take awhile for it to ship. In my case, I ordered on April 15, and it shipped on the 19th. I suspect the store gets slammed during those sales and they only have so many people to ship stuff. The order will auto-cancel if they take more than I think 9 days to ship.\n\n\\- Always be critical, double check the store you're buying from, Aliexpress is a marketplace. Read reviews, read comments on the sale post. Many people have bought from Comet Crash and gotten exacfly what they've bought. I would still personally avoid buying storage from Aliexpress because fake SD cards are so prevalent even on Amazon and other retailers. (I buy all those in person if I can)\n\n\\- You may or may not be charged customs and duties. There's been reports of it going either way. I personally was not charged anything and I live in Quebec. YMMV.",
            "# AliExpress (April 16 - April 24)\n\n* AMD Ryzen 5700X3D ($224 CAD)\n\nSo I took a gamble with these AliExpress processors and I lost. The CPU was working beautifully for two weeks then my computer suddenly shutdown and would not power back on. Computer would not POST. Having done extensive troubleshooting I thought it was the Motherboard that died, but I bought a new one and put it on the PC and worked for a couple of hours before the same thing happened.  I put my old processor into my new Motherboard and it has been working since. For kicks I tested my old Motherboard with both processors and neither would boot. Not sure if the Motherboard ended up killing the CPU or the CPU killing the motherboard, but either way dealing with AliExpress has been a nightmare. I'd have to pay for return shipping to China with no guarantees or reassurances that I would get my money back. My credit card purchase assurance would not cover this as it is a \"manufacturers defect\" so my only recourse is to file a charge back and hope it goes through. \n\nShort answer is don't buy from AliExpress to save a few bucks. You are not protected in anyway.",
            "# Amazon Canada (Apr 29 - May 3)\n\n* ($17.99 + $22.99) TP-Link AC600 USB WiFi Adapter + Lepro Desk Lamp\n\nAfter seeing the JayzTwoCents video where he showed off a rather nice slimline LED lamp I checked it out but it was too expensive; I hunted around for alternatives and ran across the LePro lamp which fitted within my budget. As I had some gift card money left over and wanted to get free shipping I looked for a cheap wifi adapter that had the 5 GHz as well as 2.4 GHz (my older one only supports 802.11n) frequencies, and ran across the TP-Link in the assorted recommended sales section.\n\nDelivery was originally scheduled for May 2 but got bumped to May 3 due to \"instructions sent by buyer\" which I thought was weird because I sure as blazes never told Amazon to change the delivery parameters. Out of an abundance of caution I changed my Amazon password just in case.\n\nDelivery on May 3 was as expected, and the products work as advertised.",
            "# Newegg (April 29 - May 1) + (May 4 - May 7)\n\n* ($164.97) G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB Series AMD EXPO 32GB\n* ($194.99) Super Flower Leadex VII XG 1000W 80+ Gold\n\nSo... Newegg, ah, Newegg. Literally the option of last resort for many, myself included. But those two orders left me impressed that they've actually shipped and delivered even faster than Amazon does. I literally got the part the day after the shipping date. I thought the ram was a lucky fluke, but then it happened again with the psu...\n\nNow lets just hope I don't have to test if their return bullshit has improved or not, but I gotta say their shipping definitively has.",
            "# ShopRBC (May 31)\n\n* WD SN580\n\nThey were kind enough to ask me if I wanted to cancel my order because instead of charging me $11 for shipping an M.2 SSD, they wanted to charge me $40 since the item was coming from BC, and I was located just outside the GTA. No clue how they have their shipping prices so high.",
            "# Newegg (June 26 - June 27)\n\n* ($239.99) Phanteks NV7\n\nMy package arrived next day, less than 24 hours after the order was placed. The item was sealed, didn't look like it was ever opened. I had to pay $20 for shipping, otherwise I was impressed. I may consider buying from them again if this keeps up.",
