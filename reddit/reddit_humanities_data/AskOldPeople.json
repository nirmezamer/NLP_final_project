Do report them for making top-level comments (replying to the post), though.\n\nFrom the sidebar: \n\n>Please only respond directly to posts if you were born in or before 1980. If you are younger, please restrict your activity to asking questions and responding to existing comments. \n\nEven though the questions are often tedious and repetitive, relationship questions are not necessarily against the rules as long as they're not about a specific relationship.  There are a million places to ask for personal or relationship advice on reddit, including r/AskOldPeopleAdvice.  \n\nWe would like to keep the focus of this subreddit on older people and their experiences, opinions, etc.  Advice posts make young people the star of the show and we would quickly be inundated if we allowed them.\n\nFinally, please use the search feature before posting a question.  We may remove questions that have been asked a whole lot.\n\nThat's about it.  This is only clarification.  There have been no rule changes.\n\nThanks!",

Adding insult to injury was Trump's comments about mentally ill people being dangerous criminals.  He's preying on the fears of uninformed people, who have no idea that the majority  of people committing crimes are NOT mentally ill at all.
