Do report them for making top-level comments (replying to the post), though.\n\nFrom the sidebar: \n\n>Please only respond directly to posts if you were born in or before 1980. If you are younger, please restrict your activity to asking questions and responding to existing comments. \n\nEven though the questions are often tedious and repetitive, relationship questions are not necessarily against the rules as long as they're not about a specific relationship.  There are a million places to ask for personal or relationship advice on reddit, including r/AskOldPeopleAdvice.  \n\nWe would like to keep the focus of this subreddit on older people and their experiences, opinions, etc.  Advice posts make young people the star of the show and we would quickly be inundated if we allowed them.\n\nFinally, please use the search feature before posting a question.  We may remove questions that have been asked a whole lot.\n\nThat's about it.  This is only clarification.  There have been no rule changes.\n\nThanks!",

            "Im going to admit that I will sometimes stare at my 5 year old great-granddaughter. Im in awe of her beauty and let it soak in. And, she reminds me of her mom, my granddaughter and her grandmother, my daughter but still has her very own identity. Ill also confess that Im envious of her endless energy and enthusiasm for life and recharge my battery with a stare now and then.",
            "We are attempting to focus",
            "Making and holding eye contact with someone while in conversation was considered polite and respectful. While looking away was a sign of deceit, looking at your phone or other object a sign of inattention and looking toward the door a sign you wished to be elsewhere.  Your grandparents, no doubt, grew up with someone saying \" Look at me when I talk to you.\" \n\nIt's amazing how many young people don't seem to understand this."
