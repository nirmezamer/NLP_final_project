        "content": "I had a miscarriage recently and I wasn\u2019t sure how much bleeding and cramping was normal. My partner knew, and tried to be supportive but unfortunately good intentions don\u2019t always translate to good actions. I made an appointment at a clinic so they could check and make sure everything was okay with me physically. I\u2019ve never been pregnancy nor miscarried before, so I have been super emotional and confused. When I went for my appointment, my partner came with me. We were there for hours, and it turns out that not all of the pregnancy tissue had been passed and called it \u201clife threatening\u201d. Not the best thing to hear when you\u2019re butt-ass naked on a table. The medical team suggested I do a suction procedure, and it was traumatic to say the least. I was sedated during the procedure, but when i wasn\u2019t drugged up I was hysterical. \n\nMy partner took me home a little while after the procedure. He did not respond to any of my messages the rest of the night. I have his location on multiple platforms, so I could see where and who he was with (multiple friends) while he ignored me. I continued to try and reach him the entire night, and proceeded to just cry myself to sleep at 2 in the morning when I still had heard nothing. Going through something I never expected to go through and not being able to talk to the one person i had hoped would support me unconditionally was such an empty feeling. \n\nI want to add that while he was ignoring me, he called one of MY friends to talk to her about how he was feeling. She reached out to me immediately because she thought it was weird that he was telling her this info and not me. Until he called her, she didn\u2019t know any of this had even happened and wanted to check on me. I was shocked that while he was ignoring my texts and calls, he was on the phone with her (once his friends had left). \n\nI\u2019m trying not to be angry, because I understand this impacts him as well. He\u2019s can have space and get a break from the emotions, but I feel like it shouldn\u2019t be at my expense. I tried to voice this to him today and he got upset with me and told me to lay off. As much as he thinks we\u2019re going through the same loss, we\u2019re not. This impacts me in much deeper emotional and physical ways than he could ever dream. I\u2019m trying to hard to give him the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately he has a history of making things about him. \n\nI\u2019m realizing he has broken my trust. I\u2019m one of those people that always ignored red flags, and I cannot tell if this is the biggest and brightest flag I\u2019ve ever seen, or if the remaining pregnancy hormones are trying to destroy my relationship. \n\nSo, WIBTA if i dumped my partner for \u201cneeding space\u201d? \n\nNote: please be brutally honest. I don\u2019t want to end a relationship just because I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself. ",

You haven\u2019t really provided concrete examples of what he has done and there is definitely a dynamic of power and \u2018elitism\u2019 if you come from wealth and he comes from a modest background. I know somebody who is currently dating a person who comes from wealth; that persons parents are passing a very similar judgement as you are without concrete evidence. I\u2019m sensing a pattern of rich people paranoid that the poor are out for their money. I\u2019m going to take another guess that your friends who say he is \u2018treating her poorly\u2019 - again, no examples provided - are also from wealth or status of some sort and are sympathizing with your side without actually being that close to daughter and boyfriend. \n\nYou say your daughter is in her twenties. If that\u2019s true, her friend group is going to go through some dramatic changes over the next decade; myself and my siblings have all been experiencing this through our twenties as we and our friends are getting busy, moving around, and prioritizing what is important to us. There is a very good chance this is exactly what is happening with your daughter\u2026 she\u2019s probably not being \u2018isolated\u2019, but just drifting away from her current friends. That happens. It\u2019s not his fault. Even if it is his fault, cutting her off would have just played into his long game, so congratulations - you\u2019ve given him exactly what he wanted by stepping away from your daughter. However, if he wanted her for money and she is now financially cut off and they stick together as they have been so far, I\u2019d say they\u2019re proving my theory that he\u2019s not a manipulative gold digger handily.\n\nWho knows, maybe it will turn out that everything you said was true. If that\u2019s the case and they split, she\u2019ll either come home with her tail between her legs and you\u2019ll welcome her back with open arms, or she\u2019ll learn how to fend for herself with the kind of fire in her belly that only being disowned by your own family can light up inside of you. Hopefully you\u2019re getting the picture\u2026 in pretty much every way this could go except for the single one you\u2019re hoping will happen - in which you still kind of suck for holding out for the implosion of your daughters partnership - you are indeed an ass.",

        "content": "A couple weeks ago me (f27) and my amazing husband (m28) got married. To me, the wedding was absolutely perfect!\n\nBackground: I joined the military fresh out of high school. Did my training and went to my first duty station, where I met my now husband and a friend named Liam (m27). My husband and Liam were in the same branch and I was in a different one, but we all worked together and became best friends. Liam and I are mixed and because we hung out so much, everyone thought we were related. So we just told everyone we were cousins. He did try to sleep with me once when we first met but I told him he looked like my sister and it was gross. I showed him a picture of her and he agreed they looked alike. So we just stayed friends. We confided in each other a lot. From heart breaks, to home drama, to work drama. We used to ride around and cry together listening to Marvin\u2019s Room.\n\nAnyway we all started to transfer. We kept in touch and I even visited them when I was on leave. Everything was  good and I still talked to Liam. Then one day he just blocked me or unfriended me on everything. I was confused because I didn\u2019t do anything. We even talked a couple days before this. I was hurt and confused. I thought we were going to be life long friends. After mourning my friendship with Liam and confiding in my now husband I was hurt. He told me Liam\u2019s new girlfriend (now wife) didn\u2019t want him to talk to other girls. I\u2019m used to acquaintances, and coworkers doing this but not my best friend. So I washed my hands.\n\nIt took another couple years until my husband and I confessed our feeling for each other. We started dating and everything was great. He is still friends with Liam and his wife. So we have went out in a group before and I was pleasant but kept my distance. My husband is aware I\u2019m not fond of them but I would not ever stop them from being friends! I\u2019m have moved on from the hurt but I don\u2019t really want anything to do with them, on my own. If that makes sense. \n\nNow, onto the wedding. The ceremony went perfectly! Even if it didn\u2019t I was too happy to even care. The reception started and everyone was getting drinks and food (Buffett style). The photographers, we had 2, were going around taking pictures of us with everyone. Liam and his wife came over and asked us for a picture. I politely declined but encouraged them to take some with my husband. Liam\u2019s wife was upset and started to argue when my man told her I didn\u2019t have to be in a the picture if I didn\u2019t want to. So I went around to other groups, taking pictures with them. The rest of the night was great but I heard Liam and his wife left early. \n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing from mutual friends that they are telling people that I\u2019m hostile and aggressive? Even our friends have called them out on it because most of them were there when it happened. Now Liam is refusing to hangout with us, even in groups until I apologize. My husband told him I\u2019m not apologizing for anything. I did give them an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way\u201d as a good gesture but it wasn\u2019t enough. I absolutely don\u2019t feel guilty at all but I also don\u2019t want my husband to lose one of his best friends. \n\nI guess I\u2019m asking more for advice than if I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nEdit: Liam \u201capologized\u201d when I started dating my husband. It\u2019s in quotes because it was more along the line of \u201csorry if I hurt you, but I made the right decision\u201d kind of thing. I forgave him but basically told him to fuck off. \nI\u2019m not mad at his wife. Shes not the one who hurt me. She has always been and will always be nothing to me but my husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife. I am always cordial to her but we\u2019re not friends. \n\nEdit #2: The photo thing was NOT a new thing. I have refused every picture they have asked me to be in. I am not hurt or bitter about Liam\u2019s friendship anymore. I am nothing but nice but maintain we\u2019re not friends and if it wasn\u2019t for my husband, we\u2019d never talk or see each other. My husband is the god father of one of Liam\u2019s kids. He love them and Liam. We have compromised on Liam being a groomsman to him being just a guest. I was not being petty or passive aggressive when I refused the photo. I simply did not want to be in it. ",

            "NTA\n\nYour mom is wrong. You would only be the asshole if you were actually planning to ask her out again.",
            "NTA at all bro, your mom sounds like she's been hurt quite a bit. So many women deal with men only being their friends for pussy, but you are actually being a legitimately good friend. Just because you'd date her if she asked doesn't make you a scumbag. If she had distanced herself from you and you kept trying to stay in her orbit, that would be weird. But she's showing comfort with you as a friend. You're a good dude bro.",
            "NTA- you can be friends with someone that rejected you, it shows maturity. If you\u2019re okay with *just* being friends, forever. If you\u2019re holding out on her liking you one day you\u2019re just setting yourself up for heartbreak.",
            "Does your mom have any friends of the opposite sex? I wonder if she thinks men and women can't be friends",
            "Yes.\n\nTo yourself. She will happily take the attention you give her. But you will feel emptier for it yourself \n\nShe ain't magically gonna have some revolutionary view and fall in love with you",
            "Goodness, some of these replies are insanely harsh. If you mean it and you genuinely do not care about ending up with her, you are NTA. If you truly just care about her happiness, then there\u2019s nothing wrong with being her friend. The belief that \u201call men only want one thing\u201d and that women and men can\u2019t be friends is insane. \n\nBeing a friend doesn\u2019t make you a \u201csimp\u201d. \ud83d\ude44",
            "You\u2019re in the friend zone. Never going to happen",
            "If you still want to be her friend regardless of whether she dates you, you are OK.  It's the creeps that hang around only pretending to be a woman's friend in the hopes that they will change their minds who are problematic.  If you legitimately consider her a friend and you don't have ulterior motives, that is respectable."
