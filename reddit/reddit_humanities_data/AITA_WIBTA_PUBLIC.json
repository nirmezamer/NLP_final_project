I've worked hard to provide for her, but maybe I focused too much on my job and not enough on her.\n\nA few months ago, she started dating this guy from a modest background. At first, I tried to keep an open mind, but soon I noticed he was controlling and manipulative. He isolated her from her friends, belittled her, and it seemed like he was only interested in her for our money. I was worried sick.\n\nDespite my concerns, she stayed with him. Every time I tried to talk to her, she defended him, saying I didn\u2019t understand. I felt desperate and frustrated. In a moment of anger and fear for her future, I gave her an ultimatum: leave him, or I\u2019d cut her off financially.\n\nShe chose him. Heartbroken and frustrated, I stuck to my word and disowned her. I stopped all financial support and cut off contact, hoping she would see the truth about him and come back. But she moved in with him, and they struggled. I heard through mutual friends that he was treating her poorly, which tore me apart. I blamed myself, thinking if I had been more present, she wouldn\u2019t have ended up with someone like him.\n\nher mother passed away when she was just seven years old. I\u2019ve always tried to be the best father to her, but maybe I failed her in some ways.\n\nMonths passed without us speaking, and I started to feel guilty about cutting her off. I missed her terribly and regretted the harshness of my decision.\n\nSo, AITA for disowning my daughter after she refused to leave her boyfriend?",

It is tough but if you are beside her, he cant get his way. It is like abusers have a secret handbook they all use. On the outside as parents we can see the giant red flags, but for some reason inside the relationship people cant. She needs you. Shes in trouble. She doesnt know it and cant see it and doesnt believe.yet. Please, please please dont let your hurt feelings override your parental instincts.  Grit your teeth, smile, and keep that steal spine strong. For her. Have a place to hide her and a be ready with your plans. When it is time, youll need all your faculties.

My buddys sister was in a similar situation. He bought her a post office box and kept a prepaid phone in it and both had keys.

        "content": "A couple weeks ago me (f27) and my amazing husband (m28) got married. To me, the wedding was absolutely perfect!\n\nBackground: I joined the military fresh out of high school. Did my training and went to my first duty station, where I met my now husband and a friend named Liam (m27). My husband and Liam were in the same branch and I was in a different one, but we all worked together and became best friends. Liam and I are mixed and because we hung out so much, everyone thought we were related. So we just told everyone we were cousins. He did try to sleep with me once when we first met but I told him he looked like my sister and it was gross. I showed him a picture of her and he agreed they looked alike. So we just stayed friends. We confided in each other a lot. From heart breaks, to home drama, to work drama. We used to ride around and cry together listening to Marvin\u2019s Room.\n\nAnyway we all started to transfer. We kept in touch and I even visited them when I was on leave. Everything was  good and I still talked to Liam. Then one day he just blocked me or unfriended me on everything. I was confused because I didn\u2019t do anything. We even talked a couple days before this. I was hurt and confused. I thought we were going to be life long friends. After mourning my friendship with Liam and confiding in my now husband I was hurt. He told me Liam\u2019s new girlfriend (now wife) didn\u2019t want him to talk to other girls. I\u2019m used to acquaintances, and coworkers doing this but not my best friend. So I washed my hands.\n\nIt took another couple years until my husband and I confessed our feeling for each other. We started dating and everything was great. He is still friends with Liam and his wife. So we have went out in a group before and I was pleasant but kept my distance. My husband is aware I\u2019m not fond of them but I would not ever stop them from being friends! I\u2019m have moved on from the hurt but I don\u2019t really want anything to do with them, on my own. If that makes sense. \n\nNow, onto the wedding. The ceremony went perfectly! Even if it didn\u2019t I was too happy to even care. The reception started and everyone was getting drinks and food (Buffett style). The photographers, we had 2, were going around taking pictures of us with everyone. Liam and his wife came over and asked us for a picture. I politely declined but encouraged them to take some with my husband. Liam\u2019s wife was upset and started to argue when my man told her I didn\u2019t have to be in a the picture if I didn\u2019t want to. So I went around to other groups, taking pictures with them. The rest of the night was great but I heard Liam and his wife left early. \n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing from mutual friends that they are telling people that I\u2019m hostile and aggressive? Even our friends have called them out on it because most of them were there when it happened. Now Liam is refusing to hangout with us, even in groups until I apologize. My husband told him I\u2019m not apologizing for anything. I did give them an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way\u201d as a good gesture but it wasn\u2019t enough. I absolutely don\u2019t feel guilty at all but I also don\u2019t want my husband to lose one of his best friends. \n\nI guess I\u2019m asking more for advice than if I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nEdit: Liam \u201capologized\u201d when I started dating my husband. It\u2019s in quotes because it was more along the line of \u201csorry if I hurt you, but I made the right decision\u201d kind of thing. I forgave him but basically told him to fuck off. \nI\u2019m not mad at his wife. Shes not the one who hurt me. She has always been and will always be nothing to me but my husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife. I am always cordial to her but we\u2019re not friends. \n\nEdit #2: The photo thing was NOT a new thing. I have refused every picture they have asked me to be in. I am not hurt or bitter about Liam\u2019s friendship anymore. I am nothing but nice but maintain we\u2019re not friends and if it wasn\u2019t for my husband, we\u2019d never talk or see each other. My husband is the god father of one of Liam\u2019s kids. He love them and Liam. We have compromised on Liam being a groomsman to him being just a guest. I was not being petty or passive aggressive when I refused the photo. I simply did not want to be in it. ",

            "Well maybe a little. But I leaned more to NTA. Your wedding your day and your decision. It's not someone else's day. Liam hurt your feelings turning his back on you as a friend. I would feel the same way. If the want to act like children let them. Let the drama go and enjoy your marriage. If Liam wants to be friends with your hubby he will if he won't he won't. That decision is theirs  to make. Enjoy your life and marriage.",
            "NTA. Congratulations!! I would have done the same thing. I don't phony kick it with anybody. Those are his friends and you did the right thing by telling them that they can take a pic with just him. The friend's girl has some nerve being mad when she was the jealous one. Liam doesn't sound like that great of a friend so I don't see it as a loss if he unfriends your husband.",
            "First, congrats on your wedding. I just want to know; why were they even invited to the wedding, especially since your husband knows the history? How can this really be one of your husband's best friends if he ghosted and continues to snub his wife like that? Was this issue ever discussed before the wedding? This is all a little weird honestly, them being invited, them even wanting a \"happy, haha, we're all friends\" picture together, them making a huge fuss. Embarrassing for them.\nNTA, but maybe a little petty (well-deserved) ",
            "NTA for a variety of reasons, the most important being that them asking you for a pic did not mandate you to do so.  That was some serious gall!!!!",
            "This was the end of the friendship. Honestly, it was over when he blocked you, but this was the final blow. Im sure your husband is done too.",
            "You already know youre NTA. Youre not a light switch and cannot turn your feelings on and off. Liam ghosted you to make her happy. What did they expect? NTA and congrats! Hubby is a good one!",
            " So now that you're married, Liam's partner is cool with you, right? You're not a threat anymore. What's up with friends cutting off long-term friends because their partners are insecure? I totally get why you did what you did. Their actions towards you were hurtful. You owe them, nothing, not even a photo, and i would tell Liam where he can shove his apology wheres your apology for cutting you out of his life. It's time to wipe your hands off this so-called friend. NTA"

Especially if you treated her as you would your other friends. As another comment said, you can judge your motivations not if she decided to ask you out, but if she found someone she was romantically interested in and youd still be her friend. Then you know it isnt that lingering hope for more.",

Just because you'd date her if she asked doesn't make you a scumbag. If she had distanced herself from you and you kept trying to stay in her orbit, that would be weird. But she's showing comfort with you as a friend. You're a good dude bro.",

Don\u2019t know their address, I assume they\u2019re in a different state because the area code on her number was different from mines.\n\nSo basically she knows about him being on the list but doesn't believe he did it for me. I know this is not what you guys wanted but I wanted to make sure and inform you guys since you guys were helping me and giving me advice. She rather put her kids at risk for a man, all I can do is pray for their safety. She said not to contact her because her and their family are going to DR for the wedding and will stay there for some time.\n\n\nShe told me they\u2019re still getting and she will let him go to therapy to fix himself, I couldn\u2019t respond because she blocked when I was ready her paragraphs.
