BRO THE ASSISTANT MANAGER TOLD ME TO CLAIM MY DRINK? WHATS YOUR PROBLEM? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d AND THE FACT I ALREADY CLAIMED THE STAFF DRINK BEFORE WITH THE STAFF CARD BY MYSELF AND HE SUDDENLY GOT PROBLEM? i\u2019m not even done yet\u2026. there were two shifts where he scheduled me but guess what? he removed them the night before? luckily i did check the shift app otherwise i would have went in without knowing, and you know what\u2019s funny? the first time he removed my shift, the next day he texted if i could work, like bro what\u2019s the point of removing my shift and you suddenly text me to come in?\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d anyways. don\u2019t ever work at koi, $10.50/hr shitty pay, tiring as fuck, stand until legs pain, many customers, fast paced, toxic managers.

            "I'm not sure how much more can be said about shooting more shots, but it's also important to consider the quality of the shots you are making. Consider your target beforehand making sure that, if you shoot, you don't regret pulling the trigger (READ: DON'T SHOOT WHEN THERE ARE OBVIOUS RED FLAGS) and that you have an exit plan if you miss. Don't go all in and realize once you've backed yourself into a corner, some mess things up by confessing all of their feelings and making it super awkward for both parties. I find asking casually prevents me from doing that (YMMV though, I am definitely not a rizzlord) and helps to ease the situation if you miss, you can laugh it off and it helps with the recovery. Learning to fail gracefully is also a necessary life skill that should be learnt and perfected, and one part of that is being able to pick yourself up after you fumble without letting it affect you too much.",
