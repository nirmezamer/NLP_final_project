        "content": "I'm 18M foreign student in Singapore. I'm gonna be straight up honest with you, respectfully, Singaporean girls are over-the-top pretty. I don't know what's so special about them but wherever I look at in any malls, there's always those good looking girls.\n\nI don't really like confessing anymore because in the past, I initiated some talks with girls I liked. I bought them stuffs like makeup, lunch, gifts etc but then when I confess them, I just ended up getting rejected.\n\nThis got worse when I came to Singapore to study. Most Singaporean girls I've talked to, they all approached me first. They would ask me about myself and sounded very interested in me. But it never took longer than a month for them to start being dry. When this happens, I just think they don't like me anymore so I usually stop texting them. But then after a few days they would double text me and initiate some talks again. THEN after like 5 minutes of that, they start being dry even worse. This exact thing happened with 5 girls already.\n\nI seriously don't understand what they want. They like me but they don't want to confess so they're just showing hints so I would confess them first? Or they just want someone to talk to so they come and talk to me only when they need me? But I see that my guy friends don't experience the same to the point that they can even get a girl to sleep with them in a week. Trust me, I don't like those type of stuffs but still...I'm hoping to find someone with experience to tell me if this is normal and what those girls want.",

            "Probably they just wanted to be friends with you but u received wrong signals. Obviously when you go and confess to the girls they may see you as a weirdo.",
            "why is bro taking every interaction with a girl as a way to date them \ud83d\ude2d you know people can just be friends right",
            "OP, those girls aren't interested in you in a romantic way. They were probably just curious about you since you are a foreign student. Dont misread their friendliness for anything else.",
            "Aight, Singaporean girl here. A few things:\n\n(1) I second many of the commenters here that girls who text you or approach you first DOESN\u2019T MEAN that they are romantically attracted to you on the get go. They approached you first perhaps you made a first good impression (i.e. you seem like a normal guy) or because you are a new (international) student so they are curious about you. That\u2019s all based on first impression. \n\n(2) When the girls text you back and forth in the beginning and things seemed okay, it was likely because they were still curious about you as a person. What would have helped to keep the conversation going was your personality and what you two talk about. Showing any signs of simping normally kills a chat fast, unless the girl has ulterior motives for befriending you in the first place). \n\n(3) Based on the examples you have shared here, it seems that you are wondering why hasn\u2019t any girl shown an equal amount of interest in you despite all your efforts in getting them to like you (buying them gifts and lunches). Duuuuude, ever considered that you might have been coming on a tad TOO strong in your endeavours? A few points to unpack here:\n\n(i) not all girls are after materialistic treats\u2014worse, they might even interpret your constant showering of gifts as you thinking that they can be \u2018bought\u2019 that way, which could make them feel cheap and just ugh. \n\n(ii) you keep saying \u201cI\u2019ve already done this and that, why won\u2019t they accept me???\u201d Take a breather here and just *pause* for a moment. Have you been paying attention to what they are looking for? All the clues are in their micro facial expressions, body language, non-verbal gestures. If you are so engrossed in your efforts in getting them to like you, to be with you, you might have been missing all these clues all this time. \n\n(iii) not all girls are the same in their reasons why they approached you first, face to face or online. Some might be genuinely curious about you (your background, the education system of where you\u2019re from), or you might have demonstrated a cool skill or shared something witty in class that piqued their interest in you, or you are actually particularly good in a particular subject/course and they would like to be your study buddy. In your frenzied pursuit of these girls, your misinterpretation of their intent might have just costed you a friendship right there and then. (Speaking from personal experience: even after telling a guy explicitly that I just want to be lab partners, the dude unfortunately misinterpreted my intentions as me playing hard to get) \n\n(iv) Even if they did accept one or all of your nice gifts and treats, it doesn\u2019t mean that they want to be in a relationship with you. If could be that they don\u2019t know how to or have the courage to decline your gifts out of politeness (in public: don\u2019t want to reject you otherwise it\u2019s embarrassing for both parties; in private: girls may fear for their safety after rejecting you) \n\nTLDR: Dude, you need to learn to listen and read the girls better instead of just focusing on what YOU want.",

I cried very terribly during that dinner trying to get it correct in front of him (otherwise i couldn\u2019t eat), but eventually i got it, and i actually appreciated that forced correction. Once u master the correct way, u can actually pick up even the tiniest peanut or dried green bean, it\u2019s that precise. It\u2019s a hidden life skill; sometimes i pity my friends who cross their chopsticks and always dropping their food on the table. Tell them why but they just shrug it off.",
            "You're not a disgrace, but it's good to learn to hold chopsticks properly. You get so much more control! They're really useful -- food preparation, serving, and of course eating. And used in so many countries in Asia.\n\nThere are also some slight variations on the supporting finger placement, no-one's really going to scrutinize if you fudge that a little for your own comfort.\n\nI myself only learned the proper form quite late. It can be learned, and once you get how it works the proper form becomes second nature with a bit of practice.",

            "I'd say whatever works for you OP \ud83d\ude42\n\nThat being said, it is possible to train yourself to use chopsticks the traditional way. I used to cross my chopsticks when I was younger, but trained myself in my 20s to hold them the traditional way just to prove to myself that I could. I've also been training to use chopsticks in my non-master hand just for fun.",
            "Depends on who you are asking. If you ask someone who holds it the 'correct' way, they will say yes, feel superior, and that only the correct way lets U take mushrooms or peanuts or whatever. \n\nIf you ask someone who uses the cross method, they will say anything goes, as long as can use it's alright.",
            "I don't think there's a wrong way in today's society esp in Singapore. I used to hold my chopsticks crossed but have forced myself to use it the traditional way. The traditional way gives you more control and capabilities. I can grab rice, tofu, scrambled eggs marbles or even cut noodles using chopsticks easily now while I cant do that if I hold them crossed.",

        "content": "Reposting because I made my post on a weekday and it got a few comments before it was taken down. \n\nSo i really need a bf...\n20F here and I'm entering uni this year.\n\nI have absolutely zero dating experience. I have never gotten male attention before, I somehow never even made guy friends/acquaintances despite being in mixed schools all my life. Sure I'm quite socially awkward, but I've always managed to make friends, though they're always girls. For whatever reason I just can't befriend guys, so getting a bf can go out the window. The one time I actually got along with a guy was in primary school and we were deskies, but I wouldn't consider that as friends because we never talked outside of lessons. Is it because I'm not pretty... \n\nI'm feeling the pressure just because it feels like age is catching up to me (even though I know I'm still young). I wasn't affected seeing my peers dating around since dating wasn't a priority then, but I'm starting to wonder if I should have prioritised it because now I'm running out of time. If I don't manage to meet someone in uni, I'd be 24 by then and still not have any experience talking to the opposite sex. If I can't even interact with them, I'm definitely not finding love anywhere. Before I know it I'll be old as fuck. Maybe I'll have a partner and be in one of those relationships made out of convenience rather than love, which isn't the worst I suppose since I'll not be forever alone. OR. I'll be single with no family, which sucks because the one dream I had since I was a kid was to be able to have a happy family and settle down. \n\nI know this is a stupid thing to worry about. But if I do manage to get a guy, I don't want to meet him so late in my life that we either have kids really late or never at all. My parents had me when they were in their 40s and idk, as a kid (like 6) I didn't enjoy being told that I needed to step up in caring for myself and my siblings because they're old, or them always pressuring me to take care of them when they get older. It wasn't what they said but how they said it. I was being constantly spoken to as if I had some evil plans to ditch them. They also had quite a lot of significant health problems along the years, at the worst I really thought I'd just lose them. \n\nI don't want my kids to be burdened with my health problems or have to wonder whether their parents would be alive to see them graduate school or attend their wedding. Idk how this because a family rant when I mainly wanted to talk about dating. \n\nTLDR: no dating exp and no one likes me, don't want to be so old until it's a bad idea to have a kid because I won't be able to take care of them well. Mb I shouldn't have kids at all, since it doesn't sound like I actually want kids but more like I want to right the wrongs I felt? ",

            "if u rly feel that way, seems like u need to take initiative and baby steps alr. start exposing urself to more chances to meet guys. join ccas, events,  new hobbies etc. or mutually meet guys via ur friends. \n\nIf possible try ur best to get rid of the mentality that ure socially awkward / \u201cwhatever reason u cannot befriend guys\u201d because the mentality itself is a significant factor in holding you back. \n\nLastly, IMO its super detrimental to have this pressure to intentionally find a bf because u may subconsciously set an expectation in ur head everytime u meet someone new (I.e u become too frigid and out of character because ure fixated on the expectation of trying to woo him as a potential partner). \n\nmeet new guys lightheartedly without any expectations, go with the flow , pick up on convos relating to mutual interests, talk to them as if they are ur girlfriends etc. and see whether u connect with them organically .

            "As someone who felt the same thought process and is still single(24), I think it is really about adjusting your mental outlook, where you shouldn't feel pressured about not having a bf. If you really want one then you should go for social events etc, but don't find one because maybe you feel FOMO or anything as that is unhealthy as well, 20 is still young and I'm sure it will work out eventually.",
            "I think before you aim to get a bf, you should aim to have just guy friends. Yes, join cca and stuff when you are in uni, attempt to make friends with guys if that's your interest, don't think there's any wrong with that. We are humans and it's normal to be attracted or interested in the opposite sex.\n\nI think the easiest way to start is to join a group of friends that consists of guys and girls, but honestly you need to step up from there or you won't get anywhere after that. Try to get alone time with guys, doesn't have to be for romantic purposes, but as a friend. Study with them, play some sports with them, anything you would normally do with a female friend do it (do be aware you can't exactly treat a guy as a girl, so be flexible with what you choose to do) , just you and him. As someone who also had such issues, I overcame it and it wasn't that bad. The first few times with someone alone I was nervous, but I got used to it very quickly and I think you will too if you try. Doing something together is good as you automatically have a thing to do, such as studying together, each of you would have to take time to read quietly, and you won't feel pressured to constantly be talking and thinking of the next topic or next step, you have time to think.\n\nThere may be the issue that what you are not good at having conversations, perhaps with girls it wasn't that obvious as you are not nervous and are able to go along with conversations they started. Think if that's the case, if it is I encourage you to learn how to start conversations and make them engaging. Guys generally have different interests in topics, some topics guys just don't understand at all, and unless they are interested in you/you can make the topic interesting, they won't be entertained. So yes, learn to yap. \n\nLastly, don't force all of these unto someone you have no interest in. If you have no interest in that someone, you most likely won't be engaged in conversations and activities but are just doing them for the sake of doing them. I don't think you will enjoy it and you may lose interest in guys afterall. Find someone/group of someone you are interested in, whether it to be ordinary friends or love interests. \n\nOptional read: All the best in your journey to form relationships, most people don't realize it but it's the most important thing to us humans. It's why it hurts so much to see someone pass, your relationship with them are forcefully cut. It's why it doesn't sound appealing to most people to be immortal and eventually be alone. I argue that everything we do is we want to be forming good relationships with others. Such as earning money, whether it be to be financially free and have free time to spend with family, or the power and authority over others that comes with being successful. My point is, relationship is what we all desire the most, hence don't be ashamed to pursue after them, nobody should look down or make fun of you for wanting to form relationships. Infact I think it's very admirable if you strife to form meaningful relationships with other people. You will struggle, but just know that what you do is right.",
            "You can start off by just putting some effort in becoming socially comfortable with others, including guys. Do casual chats here and there, greet others, etc. Things like friendship and whatnot will follow naturally :)\n\nYou can always PM people here, and we are happy to hear and help you out! :) All the best!!",
            "Correct me if I'm wrong, sounds like: \n\n1. You're looking for a bf you would like to settle down with (i.e. dating for commitment and not just for fun)\n\n2. You're aiming to have kids, and hopefully early (which I'm interpreting as \u22651 kid before age 35)\n\nCongrats! This actually helps you narrow the pool down a lot. Because you are dating young, you actually have many more options compared to a woman dating in her 30s or 40s (not judging, just being real). And if you are upfront about what you're looking for it'll be easy to filter out people who are not aligned yet (not looking for commitment or kids etc)\n\nYou are also likely to have in mind some qualities you want to see in your partner, which also means your partner likely has qualities they want to see in you too: what do you think some of those qualities might be? While you are looking for your desired one, can't hurt to spend some time working on that until you get the chance to ask them for real.\n\nLastly, if you're sure this is what you want, can't hurt your chances to tell people you trust or are close to. It *will* feel embarrassing, but what's a little embarrassment compared to having more eyes helping you look out for a potential life partner? Muteblock the mockers or naysayers, they're not going to help you so their opinion won't matter.\n\nAll the best in your first step!

            "hey girl I used to be in your position too, never had any proper male friends even though I was only ever in mixed schools. I used to cry to my friend who regularly got male attention and had many relationships. I wondered how she could find so many guys interested in her and she told me that it always starts with having true chemistry with a guy. I realized then that I didn\u2019t put myself out there to make friendships with guys, thus blocking the possibility of any further possibilities.\n\nas I grow older, I see many peers around me genuinely wanting to settle down and they no longer look for partners based on shallow factors like looks, but they look for someone they are compatible and truly enjoy spending time with. so don\u2019t worry!! I see that you are serious about the future and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to rush into a relationship with someone you can\u2019t have a long term future with.\n\n20 years old is still really young and although it can seem like everyone is getting into relationships, not all those relationships will last a lifetime too. tbh you don\u2019t wanna date too young either esp if you\u2019re dating to marry, because dating 5-6 long years before you can get married can be quite sian too.\n\nit sounds cliche but my advice is really to work on yourself before worrying about a relationship. know your identity, what your interests/passions are, your long term goals, your boundaries, what you value in a partner, because when the right guy does come along, you will need to know yourself and your goals to know if you are compatible for a future with him.\n\nkeep your head high! you have a bright mind and a whole new world to explore in uni, the happiest days of your life haven\u2019t even come yet. if you wanna talk more on this topic, I have many more thoughts to discuss haha feel free to reach out!",
            "You need to interact with dudes more to boost your chances of finding a match.\n\nOne of the ways to interact with dudes more at school is through schoolwork. You can ask for help from your peers with homework. You can also meet up with your group mates in group projects more often, even beyond the group work. For example, you can ask to eat lunch or whatever before or after the group work. I recognise that you said you're socially awkward. While it may be better to break out of your shell if you want to achieve your goals, I think it's fine if you cannot find the courage to ask these kinds of things yourself; just try to put yourself into more situations where you're forced to interact with dudes. Still, you made friends with others (albeit girls) so I think you may not necessarily be that awkward.\n\nAnother way is to go for CCAs, especially male-dominated ones, like sports. However, make sure you go for ones that you actually have an interest in. You seem to be looking ahead, not for something casual; you should prefer somebody you can spend the rest of your life with doing things together that you both enjoy.\n\nYou can also always consider using dating apps.\n\n>don't want to be so old until it's a bad idea to have a kid because I won't be able to take care of them well\n\nYou're not completely wrong. However, you should also consider the reasons for why kids should be had later in one's life.\n\nIt's not good to have a kid when you can't really afford it yet. Having kids later in your life can ensure your kids will have a more comfortable life because you would be able to afford more of the things for the kids.\n\nStill, you're right that kids should not be had too late. There's a sweet spot between too early and too late. I don't think it's the same for everyone (maybe it depends on income?), so you'd have to find it for yourself (plural you, as in you and your eventual partner).",

        "content": "Hi umm so this is what happened, i js need to talk ab it\n\nI\u2019m f17. i was in a relationship with my boyfriend m18 of 5 months up till today when i broke it off. we knew each other from some stupid tele bot (iykyk). i started getting to know him from october 2023 and we started dating  january 2024. throughout the talking stage period, i think it was mutual that we liked each other, we got along well and everything. i believed our personalities were similar. we had similar music taste and humour and basically everything else you know. i also initiated getting intimate with him first\u2026 (now that i think about it i did it too soon but oh well) and i think i had a few arguments with him about other girls he was still talking to as we weren\u2019t exclusive yet. i was only talking to him as i cut off everyone else except for him LOL. anyways we were happy for the first 2 months i think.\n\nthen started the arguing. i think maybe over the few months i could see his true colours. he was quite narcissistic and only cared for himself, no empathy, that sort of thing. he didn\u2019t know how to put himself in my shoes at all. but i was pretty irritable all the time, and i just didn\u2019t understand him at all. when i explained to him that he has to change to work things out with me, he just said \u201coh it\u2019s just him\u201d and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d i\u2019m stupid because i literally just brushed it off. this happened multiple times again by the way. it was really draining. i just felt so lost because i love him and i believed he loved me too, so it was all going to be okay.\n\nthen came like maybe 3 days ago. we got into another fight because he was calling other girls \u201cpretty\u201d \u201chave potential\u201d and oohing and ahing in front of me, and i was clearly pissed hahaha.. i just straight up asked him to stop and to apologise to me but he just didn\u2019t take me seriously. it was quite immature of me but i blocked him everywhere after that. i felt that i let what he do slide so many times so he\u2019s okay with treating me badly, so i should set my boundary and not let him do so.\n\nhe was blocked, he didn\u2019t try to contact me or anything, i felt he didn\u2019t care at all. when i unblocked him earlier today, he texted me  asking if we were going to talk. then i said yeah and just initiated some small talk but he was dry. then i just said i was still angry and stuff, and asked if he even wanted to resolve it with me. he said blocking wouldn\u2019t make him care at all so i said okay and just said some mean stuff to him.\n\nat night i was just scrolling his instagram and i found a new girl he was following, i contacted her and found out he was flirting with her. like even before the argument i think. the girl didn\u2019t know and apologised to me. it really wasn\u2019t her fault. i texted my boyfriend about it and he just said what he is supposed to say as we weren\u2019t working out. i just said why would you do it behind my back and just said i didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be that low of a person. i asked him to mail back my things to me and yeah.\n\nso about how i feel, i just didn\u2019t expect him to do me dirty like that. i just wanted him to care about us and want to fix things. i think that maybe he was too tired of arguing all the time that he just decided to talk to other girls. but behind my back just really hurts. it\u2019s like what we had wasn\u2019t real at all and it just sucks right now. he cheat on me, i\u2019m not even sure is it my fault or his. i\u2019m just very lost and i don\u2019t know what to do right now. sorry if this is so long\u2026..",

            "bro by your definition he already cheated on u by flirting with other girls. on top of that he\u2019s super red flag as u mentioned that he constantly checked out other girls while he\u2019s with you. would u really want him to be a long term partner and continue \u201cloving\u201d him albeit being treated this way / once u saw his true colours? IMO be steadfast and resolute, end it and treat + respect urself better fr. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this nor does he deserve a second chance from u. \n\nobjectively , none of it should be your fault if u knew u tried ur best in the r/s already. Don\u2019t victimise urself and give him the benefit of the doubt simply because you are still infatuated with him. His actions have already shown otherwise on his stance on this r/s",

            "good he cheated on you now, rather than cheat on you when you were fully invested. things happen for a reason. take this as a blessing in disguise. you\u2019ll surely find someone who truly cares for you and will not go around talking to other girls in that sense",
            "That's not normal. He seems pretty toxic and already cheated. If he wants to flirt with someone else he should atleast have the decency to end the relationship and it doesn't seem like he wants a relationship. He just wants to have fun",
            "From the start to the end\u2026 he was just playing. All the words and actions were just means to get what he wants, it\u2019s just part of a game to him.\n\nDon\u2019t expect serious things to come out of such encounters online.",

            "I dont think he cheated... cause he never made yall exclusive ykwim? But i dont think he loved you either... if he was serious about yall then he wouldve made yall exclusive\n\nEdit: oh! Sorry, yall got exclusive later. Uhh not cuffing u up quickly lowkey red flag... and he rlly shldnt be talking to other girls! He isnt serious about you, didnt love-Love you, and isnt husband material!!",
