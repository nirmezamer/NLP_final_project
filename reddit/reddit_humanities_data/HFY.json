        "content": "##Content Theft\n\nGreetings citizens of HFY! This is your friendly Modteam bringing you a (long overdue) PSA about stolen content narrated and uploaded on YouTube/TikTok without your express permission. With the increased availability of AI resources, this is sadly becoming more and more common. This post is intended to be a resource and reference for all community members impacted by content theft.\n\n###What is happening:\n\nLong story short, there are multiple YouTube and TikTok (and likely other platforms, but those are the main two) accounts uploading HFY Original Content and plagiarizing it as their own work, or reproducing it on their channel without permission. As a reminder to everyone, **reproducing someone else's work in any medium without their permission is plagiarism,** and is not only a bannable offence but may also be **illegal.** Quite often these narrations are just AI voices over generic images and/or Minecraft footage (which is likely also stolen), meaning they are just the lowest possible attempt at a cash grab or attention. That is, of course, not to say that even if the narrator uses their own voice that it still isn't content theft.\n\nWe do have a number of lovely narration channels, [listed here in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/audio) who do ask nicely and get permission to use original content from this subreddit, so please check them out if you enjoy audio HFY!\n\nSome examples of this activity:\n\nStolen Content Thread #1: [Here](https://redd.it/o3ufp2)  \nStolen Content Thread #2: [Here](https://redd.it/15g7nnf)  \nStolen Content Thread #3: [Here](https://redd.it/15j35w4)  \nStolen Content Thread #4: [Here](https://redd.it/1760tv3)  \nStolen Content Thread #5: [Here](https://redd.it/1bgvr9h)\n\n###What to do about it:\n\n**If you are an author** who finds your work has been narrated without your permission, there are a few steps to take. Unfortunately, the mods here at Reddit have no legal methods to do so on your behalf on a different platform, you must do this yourself.\n\nYou as the author, regardless of what platform you post you story on, always own the copyright. If someone is doing something with it in its entirety without your permission, you have the right to take whatever measures you see fit to have it removed from the platform. Especially if they intend to profit off of said content. If no credit is given to the original author, then it is plagiarism in addition to IP theft. And not defending your copyright can make it harder for you to defend it in the future, which is why so many big companies take an all or nothing approach to enforcement (this is somewhat dependent on your geographical location, so you may need to check your local legislation).\n\n* **YouTube**: Sign in to your YouTube account and go to the YouTube studio of your account. There is the option of submitting a copyright claim. Copy and paste the offending video link and fill out the form. Put your relationship to the copyright as original author with your info and submit. It helps to change the YouTube channel name to your reddit name as well before issuing the strike.\n\n  * You can also state your ownership in the comments to bring attention from the casual viewer of the channel who probably doesn't know this is stolen work.\n\n* **TikTok**: If you find a video that\u2019s used your work without your consent you can report it here: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright\n\n  * You can also state your ownership in the comments to bring attention from the casual viewer of the channel who probably doesn't know this is stolen work.\n\n**If you are not an author directly affected**, do *not* attempt to fill copyright claims or instigate official action on behalf of an author, this can actually hamper efforts by the author to have the videos removed. Instead, inform the original author about their stolen work. Please do not harass these YouTube/TikTok'ers. We do not want the authors' voices to be drowned out, or to be accused of brigading.\n\n**If you are someone who would like to narrate stories you found here**, simply ask the author for permission, and respect their ownership if they say no.\n\n**If you are someone who has posted narrated content without permission**, delete it. Don't ever do it again. Feel ashamed of yourself, and ask for permission in the future.\n\nTo all the users who found their way here to r/hfy thanks to YouTube and TikTok videos like the ones discussed above: Hello and welcome! We're glad that you managed to find us! That does not change the fact that what these YouTube/TikTok'ers are doing is legally and morally in the wrong.\n\n---\n\n##FAQ regarding story narration and plagiarism in general:\n\n- \"But they posted it on a public website (reddit), that means I can do whatever I want with it because it's free/Public Domain!!\"\n\nThe fact that it is posted in a public place does **not** mean that the author has relinquished their rights to the content. [Public Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) is a very specific legal status and must be directly and explicitly applied by the author, or by the age of the story. Unless they have explicitly stated otherwise, they reserve ALL rights to their content by default, other than those they have (non-exclusively) licensed to Reddit. This means that you are free to read their content here, link to it, but you can **not** take it and do something with it, any more than you could (legally) do with a blockbuster Disney movie or a professionally published paperback. A work only enters the public domain when the copyright expires (thanks to The Mouse, for newly published work this is effectively never), or when the author explicitly and intentionally severs their rights to the IP and releases the work into the public domain. A work isn't \"public domain\" just because someone put it out for free public viewing any more than a book at your local library is.\n\n- \"But if it's on reddit they aren't making money from it, so why should they care if someone else does?\"\n\nThis is doubly wrong. In the first place, there *are* many authors in this community who make money on their writing here, so someone infringing on their copyright *is* a threat to their income. We're aware of several that don't just do this as a side-hustle, but they stake their entire livelihood on it: it is their full-time job. In their case, it could literally be a threat to their *life*.\n\nSecondly and perhaps more importantly, even if the author *wasn't* making money from their writing and never did, *it doesn't matter.* Their writing is *their writing*, belonging to them, and unless they explicitly grant permission to someone to reproduce it elsewhere (which, FYI, is a right that most authors here would be happy to grant if asked), **nobody** has the right to reproduce that work. Both as a matter of copyright law, and as a matter of ethics--they worked hard on that, and they ought to be able to control when and where their work is used if they choose to enforce their rights.\n\n- \"How is this any different than fan fiction, they're just showing their appreciation for a story they like?\"\n\nMost of these narration channels are simply taking the text as-is and reading it verbatim. There's not a mote of transformative work involved, nothing new is added to the underlying ideas of the story. In a fanfiction, the writer is at least putting a new spin on existing characters or settings--though even in that case, [copyright law is still not squarely in their favor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction).\n\n- \"Okay so this might normally be a copyright violation, but they're reading it in a new medium, so it's fair use!\"\n\nOne of our community members wrote up a great explanation about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/o36563/what_happened_to_the_creator_of_the_pink_series/h2ft4qw/) that will be reproduced below. To summarize, for those who don't click through: no, it's not [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html). Copyright fully applies here.\n\n> This is not fair use, in any sense of the term. A public forum is not permission to repost and redistribute, unless that forum forces authors to grant a license that allows for it. An example often brought up in that respect is the SCP wiki, which sets all included work to be under a creative commons license.\n\n> That is not the case for Reddit, which grants no such licenses or permissions. Reading text aloud is not significant enough change to be a transformative work, which removes allowances that make things like fanfiction legal. Since this is not transformative work, it is not fair use as a parody.\n\n> Since money was involved, via Patreon and marketed goods, fair use allowances for educational purposes are greatly reduced, and no longer apply for fiction with an active copyright. (And if the author is still alive, the copyright is still active.)\n\n> There are four specific things that US copyright law looks at for fair use. Since Reddit, Youtube, and Patreon are all based in America, the relevant factors in the relevant legal code are:\n\n> 1. **Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes:** this youtube channel is for profit, using original fiction with no changes whatsoever to the story. No allowances for fair use under this point.\n> 2. **Nature of the copyrighted work:** the copywritten works are original fiction, and thus face much stricter reading of fair use compared to a news article or other nonfiction work. Again, no allowances for this case under this point.\n> 3. **Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:** The entire story is being narrated, and thus, this point is again a source of infringement on the author's rights.\n> 4. **Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:** The work is being monetized by the infringer, and is online in a way beyond the original author's control. This dramatically limits the original author's ability to publish or monetize their own work if they ever choose to do so, especially if they don't contest the existing monetization now that they're aware of them.\n\n> There is no reasonable reading of copyright or fair use that grants people permission to narrate and/or monetize a reddit post made by someone else. This is not the SCP wiki or stackexchange - the only license granted by the author is the one to Reddit themselves.\n\n> Publicly posting a story has never, at any point, been even remotely equivalent to granting the reader rights to do with it as they please, and anyone who believes such fundamentally misunderstands what \"public domain\" actually is.\n\n- \"Well it's pretty dickish for writers to tell these people to take their videos down, they're getting so much *exposure* from this!!\"\n\nIf a person does not enforce their rights when they find out that their copyright has been infringed, it can undermine their legal standing to challenge infringement later on, should they come across a new infringement they want to prosecute, or even just change their mind about the original perpetrator for whatever reason. Again, this can be dependent on geographic location. Not enforcing copyright can make a court case more complicated if it winds up in court, since selective enforcement of rights will give a defendant (unstable) ground to stand on.\n\nWith that in mind, it is simply prudent, good sense to clearly enforce their copyright as soon as they can. If an author doesn't mind other people taking their work and doing whatever they want with it, then they should *state that*, and publish it under a license such as Creative Commons (like SCP does). Also, it's really dickish to steal people's work for any purpose.\n\nAdditionally, many contracts for professional publishing require exclusivity, so something as simple as having an unknown narration out there could end the deal. Unless and until the author asserts their rights, they cannot sign the contract and receive money from publishing their work. i.e. this unasked for \"exposure\"  could directly cause them harm.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to u/sswanlake, u/Glitchkey, and u/AiSagOrSol3-43912 for their informative comments on this post and elsewhere; several of the answers provided in this PSA were strongly inspired by them.",

            "After reading a post yesterday about possible theft in this subreddit and I became obsessed with trying to create a list of youtube channels that narrates HFY stories. Here are some of my observations:\n\n\\- More and more channels have started HFY narration, especially this year\n\n\\- Most provides link to the original content\n\n\\- There is an increase in number of channels that allegedly creates their own content but with simingly AI generated titles  \nThis is the link to the google sheet if anyone is interrested: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QAIW\\_z0qDVCv1nkvaT9e7FNoca3PNSegdsmqaH6BSwQ/edit?usp=sharing",
            "I came to HFY after I started hearing story podcasts on youtube,  \nFew steps to fight the Content theft from youtubers\n\n1. if your story gets more than 20/50 or 100 upvotes, The writer should start uploading their own content on youtube, It's easy to get a free computer voice, who will read your stories,, record it,, and upload it on youtube,,,\n2. Writers might want to become youtubers,,, or few writers who know each other,, can come together to start a youtube channel (please see- writer don't need to become youtubers,, but just data dump your top liked stories,, so that,, those scammers can't steal the content.",
            "Would be nice if you had a list of channels that are to be avoided as well.",
            "First of all, i came here because Youtube offered me video of one of those AI narrated stories. Story itself had link here to reddit and author so i guess it was fair play. Even if it wasn't that Youtube author gave one new reader to basically all authors on this subreddit. So even if they steal your work, it might not be all doom and gloom.\n\nBut this post is not about that. You as an author for sure do not have time to write, and be youtuber, and be tiktoker and god knows what and fight claims on bunch of different platforms at once. You probably just want to write and get people to enjoy your work. That's why you are publishing your work on this subreddit after all.\n\nBut i don't think everything is lost. Even if you can not fight those fights alone, you might be able to fight as a group. Authors should band together and arrange with one or few narrators right to narrate and let THEM fight copycats on their respective social networks. They are Youtubers, they are TikTokers, they have content and they have time to report and deal with reports.\n\nYou just have to officially and publicly give them right to narration for social network they operate on and let them fight for what they are doing. They might tell you what exactly they need from you as an author. Maybe write who can narrate at bottom of the text, maybe some other kind of proof. I am not a lawyer so i can not give you exact advice on that part, but if you band together and start talking to them, you might bet good info on how you and them together can deal with bunch of channels that are stealing your work.\n\nI come from software world, open source and Github is close to my heart, i know that groups of developers can protect themselves by grouping up their work and than acting as one to outside world but still have their work be separated and linked to their respective authors, even down to specific like of code. You might even have collabs like putting your stories into same \"universe\" and still have clear separation of ownership or even have multiple people working on same story. You can help each other, fix gaps in storytelling etc. and still have clear idea who wrote what, who has how much ownership of what etc. and act as one to outside world. Ones action to prevent theft would have effect on everyone else. It would act as force multiplier of sorts.\n\nAnyway, i hope this at least gives you some kind of idea that will help you fight this as it is really sad to see something like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1bggiwg/they\\_answered\\_the\\_callpart\\_nine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1bggiwg/they_answered_the_callpart_nine/)  \nHe wrote nine really good chapters and because of theft he deleted it all.\n\nEDIT: Turns out author on link i pasted did not delete because of theft (which he was victim of as you can see on that link) but because of even worse thing....politics....",

So much to talk about. A month was a long time, and so much had happened since Basti had left the mountain and Haven, not even considering everything that's happened since I set out. \n\nRegardless, we left the Tranquility Cafe before long and returned to the streets, heading for the Ocean's Mist Inn to meet Riley, Lostrill, and Krys and his team. \n\nWhile I wasn't sure where we needed to go, Basti was apparently familiar with the place. She had eaten there a week ago in her quest to try all sorts of cooking from various places. It had a quality menu that used ingredients sourced from Crimzeal's coastal floor, and according to Basti's research, the Inn got these ingredients for a particularly good price due to its relationship with the Merchant's Guild and how often it puts up VIPs who come into town. \n\nRegarding Crimzeal, Basti still didn't know all that much despite how long she had been here, considering she had been focused on other things and was doing her best not to alert the dungeon of her presence in the first place. So, Crimzeal will have to be a topic for Riley and Lostrill to look into for me since they're the only ones I can rely on who have no tangible bond to me. \n\nWe still had a long way to walk. The Merchant's Guild office was apparently two whole sectors away from the Cafe Basti had been waiting for us in. Basmori and Freyli decided to hitch a ride with their mother. Freyli happily perched on Basti's shoulder while Basti carried Basmori in her arms as a cub himself. \n\nI admittedly did feel a little lonely at the fact that neither of them wanted to walk with or ride on my shoulders, but then again, they no doubt missed their mother and deserved to be spoiled with her company\u2014even if, in doing so, they occupied both of her hands. Well, it's not like I specifically wanted to hold hands with Basti while we walked, or did I? \n\nIt's clear to even me that the feelings Basti and I have for each other have only grown during our time apart. I've wanted to see and be around her just as much as she wanted to see and be around me, but what would that entail in practice? What sort of expectations does she have, and what should I expect in return? \n\nI stole a glance over at Basti, only to catch her glancing at me in return as I couldn't help but offer a small smile, getting a smile in return as she looked away before stepping closer to me as our shoulders now brushed against each other while we continued along our walk. \n\nI couldn't help but smile at her gesture, though a few sets of eyes burning into the back of my head caused me to glance behind me at Fester, Wither, and Legosi. Fester was giving me an encouraging thumbs up, much to Wither's vague amusement, while Legosi seemed to be all around pleased by the circumstances for whatever reason. \n\nThe minutes trickled by as we walked, and before I knew it, we had entered what looked like a temple district, if I had to put a name to it. Carriages now appeared to be a rarity as the foot traffic bled onto the roads, making the crowds around us appear less dense as they had more space to move around.  \n\nLooking at the buildings around us, the architecture vaguely reminded me of a sort of Greco-Roman style, with large commanding temples with symmetrical fronts and mighty pillars decorating the various structures. The temples themselves were also lovingly decorated and maintained, often with massive murals that spanned walls and pillars depicting the nature of the gods or goddesses that the respective temples worshiped. \n\nWith only passing glances through the massive doorways that most temples seemed to have, I got the feeling that most temples weren't dedicated to any one deity but to general domains that the deities represented, like intrigue, music, war, or nature. \n\nWe had almost crossed through the temple district when I felt a set of eyes pass over me before suddenly looking at my chest or perhaps my clothes as they focused on me. Looking around at my surroundings, I soon spotted an excited-looking rabbitkin girl dressed in simple vestments with several shades of blue and gold accents. The girl in question practically scampered across the street to reach me before standing confidently in front of me as she spoke up. \"Excuse me, sir, I am on an important quest which was granted to me by the Head Priest of my temple. May I take a moment of your time?\"\n\nShooting a curious look at Basti, she merely shrugged as I looked back to the girl who couldn't be older than nine or maybe even ten years old. \"Uh... Sure? What is this quest of yours?\" \n\n The girl practically hopped in place, reaching into a pouch on her hip and procuring two copper coins. \"I'm supposed to approach human men wearing black shirts and give them these.\" She said while holding the coins up in her palm. \"In exchange, you just need to let me hit you in the leg.\" She explained while waggling an appropriately sized quarterstaff in her other hand that she had been walking with from the outset. \n\n\"That's, uhh... a rather unique quest.\" She wasn't lying to me and didn't seem to have any underlying motives, so why not? \"Sure, go ahead.\" I offered after a moment while plucking the coins from her palm with my gloved hand.\n\n\"Really!? Thank you, sir. With this, you'll be the last one I must hit.\" She mused sincerely before stepping back and swinging the quarterstaff with surprising proficiency, which clacked audibly against my knee. \n\nEven though she was small, the force of her swing would have likely brought most men to their knees from the mere shock of the hit. Thankfully, I didn't feel anything. I just smiled at the girl and quirked my brow in curiosity. \"There we go. Was that all?\" \n\nThe girl looked especially thoughtful, staring at my leg with furrowed brows as she lightly tapped it with the staff she wielded. \"Your leg... Is it made of wood, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is; why do you ask?\" I asked in return while bouncing the two coins in my palm. \n\nThe girl hummed in apparent consideration before reaching into her hip pouch again and procuring a small, folded slip of paper and what looked to be some kind of golden coin with a side profile of a blindfolded head on the face and a sword with old-fashioned scales imprinted on its back. \"I was told to give this to the man with a wooden leg.\" She stated with a simple smile. \n\n\"What is this?\" I asked, taking the token and looking it over before passing it to Wither, who had come over to see what was happening. \n\n\"It's a token with the mark of our order; it allows you access to the inner courtyards of the temple.\" She explained helpfully while still holding up the slip of paper. \"Head Priest Siodric would like to speak to you about something.\" \n\n\"Really? He wants to speak to me specifically?\" I asked while gently plucking the slip of paper from her hands. \n\n\"I dunno. All he told me was to give that token and the note to a human man in black with a wooden leg.\" She said with a cheerful bounce, clearly pleased at completing her assigned quest. \n\n\"I see...\" Now, unfolding the slip of paper, I can't help but be taken aback at its contents. 'Aspect of the Trio of Divines, please meet me at your earliest convenience. I have been tasked with paying you a favor that will aid you going forward.' Not only does this individual know I'm an Aspect, but this letter is written entirely in English. \"Say, can you read the writing on this note?\" I asked, playing it cool as I showed the contents of the slip of paper to the girl. \n\nThe girl hummed thoughtfully while squinting at the writing, leaning forward on her staff as she animatedly bobbed her head from side to side. \"Hmm... Nope! I have no idea what it says, sir. Sorry!\" She exclaimed with a sincerely energetic smile, still happy she had found the one she had been looking for.\n\n\"It's fine. Well, good work finding me. You should probably get back home or um... Something now that you're done.\" I suggested before looking around and looking back at the rabbitkin girl as I pretended to tuck the slip of paper into the collar of my armored coat and stashed it away. \"Though, before you go, where can I find your Head Priest? In fact, where is your temple?\"  \n\n\"Oh, right. You'd probably need to know that,\" the girl reasoned as she scratched behind one of her fluffy ears. She then stood taller before pointing down the road with her staff. \"Look for the temple with the people who are dressed like me. The priests will all be wearing blindfolds, which should help you find us.\" \n\n\"Blindfolds? Do a lot of temples have people wearing blindfolds?\" I couldn't help but think about the Cafe we had just left and wonder if that was a common trend around these parts. \n\nThe girl idly bounced up and down, standing on her toes before rolling back to her heel as she considered my question. \"A few temples use blindfolds, yes, but for different reasons.\" She said, though it soon became clear that she wasn't planning to expand on that particular thought.\n\n\"Alright, well, I'll visit this Head Priest Siodric later. I'm actually kinda busy with something else, so if you'll excuse us.\" I vaguely explained while gesturing to my entourage. \n\n\"Oh, of course, sir, I do hope you have a good day now; bye-bye!\" She declared enthusiastically before dismissing herself and hurrying back to her temple. \n\nAs she left, Wither went about handing me the token back, and we started walking again. Basti glanced back at the girl curiously before regarding me with a quirked brow and a twitch of an ear. \"So what about that letter threw you off? Is something wrong?\"  \n\n\"I'm... Not sure.\" I admitted as I stashed the token away before pulling the note from my storage and showing it to her. \"Can you read this?\"\n\nBasti's ears twitched as she leaned over to look at the note; Freyli and Basmori also craned their heads around to peek at the paper's contents. After a moment, Basti merely shook her head before standing tall again. \"I know it's written in one of the languages of your home, but I'm not sure what it says.\" \n\nThat was more than I anticipated as I simply bobbed my head at her words. \"It's written in English, and somehow they know about the three beings watching over me and that I have or rather am their Aspect.\" \n\nBasti's brows rose briefly as she listened and thought back to our conversation in the cafe. \"Your Handler and Sponsors, right?\" \n\n\"Yeah, and besides knowing what I am, this Head Priest Siodric wants me to meet him so he can do me a favor or something.\" I explained as I looked the note over before stashing it away again. \"At the very least, I can take my time with it since he said I can show up at my earliest convenience.\" \n\nBasti nodded along before flashing a toothy grin. \"Why wait? We could always pay him a visit on our time... How about tonight? We could get the drop on him if you want.\" \n\nI couldn't help but do a double take at Basti, and her suggestion, but something about it brought a smile to my face, and I just chuckled a bit. \"You know what? Yeah, it sounds like fun. If he can get away with blindsiding me like this, it is only right to return the favor.\" \n\n\"Then it's a date.\" Basti said pleasantly, bumping her shoulder into mine as she maintained her confident grin before focusing on the path ahead of us. \n\n\"A-A date? Are you sure?\" Even given my age, if I were flesh and blood, I wouldn't be ashamed to say my cheeks would have flushed at the sudden turn in this conversation. \"Wouldn't you want to do something proper? Like a dinner and a show or something like that?\" \n\nBasti could only scoff at the suggestions as she glanced back at me. \"What even is a 'proper' date? This sounds like so much more fun! Besides, I've learned that the real fun around these parts happens at night.\" She enthused as she walked ahead of the group, her tail swaying and lashing with excitement behind her. \n\nWell... I guess it's official, then. Our first date together will start off with some light B&E and surprising an unsuspecting Head Priest... Even I can't deny that it sounds like the makings of some rather good fun. If that's how things are right out of the gate, I can't help but wonder how the rest of the night will go... \n\nRegardless, there wasn't much else to say as our group strolled through town until we eventually came to Ocean's Mist Inn and went inside. From the outset, the Inn was a much larger affair than the one I had stayed at back in Sunspot Keep. It was about five floors tall and had a floor plan nearly twice as wide as the other Inn. Despite being that gray area between the afternoon lunch rush and the evening dining crowd, the Inn's dining area was quite busy, with a number of full tables and even occupied seats at what looked to be the main bar. \n\nWe only had to wait a couple of minutes as we approached the dining area before a hostess made their way up to us with the most professional of customer service smiles on her face. \"Greetings! Welcome to Ocean's Mist Inn. Are you here to dine in or perhaps looking for a room?\" She asked before noticing Basti as her eyes seemed to light up in recognition. \"Ah! Miss Basti, welcome back.\" She expressed with more sincere warmth and delight. \"I took your advice and bet on your last run in the daily tournaments and came away with quite the generous coin purse, so you certainly have my thanks. Would you like a table or perhaps a private room for your party?\" She asked, giving the rest of us a proper couple of glances. \n\nBasti flashed the woman a charming grin as she spoke up. \"You and me both, I'm glad to hear it. Hopefully, you can get that matter of yours settled soon.\" She said before tilting her head in my direction as if to gesture at me. \"As for why I'm here today, you should ask my partner here; I believe we're supposed to be meeting someone.\" \n\nThe hostess turned to look at me, the word 'partner' curiously bouncing around in her head as she wondered what that made me to Basti. It was then that she finally noticed the elite pin on my armored coat's collar. \n\n\"Right, well, my name is Vito.\" I start to say while gesturing to myself. \"I was supposed to meet a couple of my workers here, a rabbitkin woman named Riley and a lizardkin man known as Lostrill.\" \n\nThe hostess nodded as she recalled Lostrill and Riley, as she had been the one to guide them to a private room in the last hour. \"Oh! The party for Vito, and of course, you're Vito.\" The woman surmised before nodding to herself. \"Very well, sir, if you all will follow me.\" She said as she turned on her heel and led us further into the Inn's dining area. \n\nOur group drew quite a few looks as we made our way through the room, but nobody distinctly lingered on us as many were simply curious about Legosi or the Plague Doctors, though a few of them seemed to recognize Basti. For once, I appeared to be the most mundane individual in the group, at least at first glance. \n\nApproaching a set of nicely carved double doors, the hostess opened both doors for the group while holding one door, in particular, open for us as we approached Riley and Lostrill in mid-conversation. \n\n\"I just don't understand why you insist on eating it raw when it's perfectly normal to eat it cooked. Aren't there health risks?\" Riley asked, clearly perturbed by what she was seeing. \n\nLostrill, for his part, plucked a reddish-orange slice of raw fish and lifted it into the air while opening his jaws wide. He dropped the fish slice into his mouth and snapped his jaws shut before looking rather content and amused by Riley's reactions and replied while still chewing. \"It's perfectly fine. They eat it all the time like this across the ocean and... and... Oh, hey, Mister Vito.\" He said while quickly swallowing and getting to his feet, doing his best to make himself presentable. \n\nRiley quickly set down her cup of tea, wiping her lips as she stood as well out of respect. \"Welcome Mister Vito, I trust your... meeting went... Well...\" She said, trailing off as she spotted Basti, having to look up at her the way she would look up at me, considering our height difference when compared to the rabbitkin woman. \n\nI could sense that Riley was not expecting Basti to be... Well... Basti. A big, physically strong woman with looks that could kill and looks like she could kill you. The general feeling I got from both Lostrill and Riley was a sense of nervous awe, which made sense since Basti seems to leave an impression on others around her, whereas people can't help but overlook me in general. \n\nThe hostess piped up during the pause, looking amongst everyone there before regarding Basti in particular. \"Your server will be here shortly to take your orders.\" With that, she made her way out, shutting the doors behind her.\n\nBasti decided to take the initiative and approached Riley and Lostrill, shaking their hands with a pleasant smile. \"It's a pleasure to meet you two. I've already heard all about you from Vito; thank you for making the trip with him and helping him manage the business he'll be running during our stay here.\" \n\n\"Well, of course, Miss Basti, it's the least we could do after everything Mister Vito has done for Guildmaster Tilzim and The Miner's Guild. The foundry is the backbone of Sunspot Keep; if it weren't for Mister Vito, we would have had many issues and broken agreements, tarnishing the guild's reputation.\" Riley dutifully explained while discretely flexing and massaging the hand that Basti shook. \n\n\"Speaking of the business.\" Lostrill piped up as he procured a folder, a coin pouch, and a ring of identical-looking keys before sitting back down in his seat at the table. \"Guild Master Tilzim arranged a weekly stipend for each of us, basically enough coin for necessities, room and board, and a little extra for our free time.\" He explained while gesturing between him and Riley. \"As well as a tidy little sum for you to furnish your building.\" \n\n\"Right, my building! Have you seen it yet?\" I asked eagerly as I took a seat at the table. Basti settled in beside me while everyone else found their place, and Basmori went so far as to shift into a beastkin as he took a chair beside Freyli.\n\n\"We have not, Mister Vito, though we have the floorplan here.\" Riley explained as she picked up the folder Lostrill set out, plucked out the schematics with the detailed floor plan drawn up, and held it out for me to see. \"It's a three-story building with a basement with running water, light, and access to the city's communication hub. The first floor is already set up with a floor plan designed to be used as a store, with the second floor having the utilities for a kitchen space, bathroom, and what would be a living room, whereas the third floor is equipped with a layout fit for a couple of bedrooms and perhaps office space.\" \n\nWhile this shop may be a front for a base of operations for me to work out of during my stay in this town, I can't help but feel the excitement of actually owning a piece of property, a piece of proper civilization. Sure, I have my mountain and the Haven, but this is a shop in the city. It just... It feels different if that makes any sense. \"It looks perfect.\" I say after a few moments, taking up the schematics to look them over more closely. \"And I just have to furnish it, you say? Is there a furniture store you can recommend? We'll probably need to shop for groceries, among other things, if we'll be living out of this place now that I think about it.\"\n\nRiley bobbed her head dutifully. \"I already made some inquiries and can show you to the more reputable of those sorts of shops, Mister Vito; you can count on me.\" She said proudly as Lostrill nodded along. \n\nBefore I could say anything else, the doors to the room were pushed open as a nicely dressed ratkin stepped into the room. \"Here we are, party for Vito.\" He said, waving along Krys and his team as they filed into the room. \"Terribly sorry for the delay; I'll be along with more menus and return to take your order.\" He explained apologetically before hurrying off and shutting the doors behind him. \n\nOnce the doors were shut, Krys stepped towards me with a vaguely strained expression on his face. \"Boss, we've got a few things to talk about.\"\n\n\n[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1davh8j/the_survivor_becomes_a_dungeon_chapter_163) [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xi9fw0/the_survivor_becomes_a_dungeon_chapter_0)\n\n\n[In Vitmori\u2019s Care (WIP 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1dhmwlq/in_vitmoris_care_wip_4)\n\n[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/4cTvfAShKF)\n\n[Interstellar Combat Courier](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1aoveuk/interstellar_combat_courier_chapter_1_enter_the)\n\n[Chapter Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/17yusqj/the_survivor_becomes_a_dungeon_chapter_list)\n\n[Future Art Comissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/183bpj0/future_art_commissions)\n\n[Vitmori Enters the Clearing (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/17qmrrv/vitmori_enters_the_clearing_finished) / [Vitmori\u2019s Heart (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/17zncyf/vitmoris_heart_finished) / [Expedition Start(Completed)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/19ezn1y/expedition_start_completed) / [His Last Stand (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1b3mj2i/his_last_stand_finished) / [Candidate Located: Begin Transfer (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1bl5nh2/candidate_located_beginning_transfer_finished) / [Mama Cat (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1clapxt/mama_cat_finished) / [Courier Interrupted (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1c965hp/courier_interrupted_finished) / [Siege Breaker (Finished)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon/comments/1cz9awl/siege_breaker_finished)\n\n\n[Sally_the_Sow/Artist](https://twitter.com/Sally_the_Sow/status/1681261011146244096?t=5ZIQwAdo92BJ00zjoJyptw&s=19)\n\n[Join the subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorBecomeDungeon) \n\n[RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58940/the-survivor-becomes-a-dungeon)\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/scribblingfox98)\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/ScribblingFox)\n\n\n-\n\n\n",

Immediately after arriving, Markus awakens to an ability so rare, so powerful that it makes every god on Firellia desperate to recruit him as their new champion.\n\nLearning to control his innate mastery over mana, Markus will devour the very essence of any monster, demon, or god that dares get in his way, determined to never lose his freedom again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d410lk/harmless_human_sacrifice/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1dkqtbk/harmless_human_sacrifice_21/) | Next | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/silverdawnwrites) \n\nEver tried to find a single imp in a dungeon completely full of \u2018em?\n\nTurns out it wasn\u2019t as hard as Markus envisioned it being. Not even remotely so. \n\n\u201cYeah, I think I know who you\u2019re talking about. Why the fuck are you looking for *him*?\u201d he was asked the moment he found a lone worker, a bipedal furred thing with four arms that almost resembled a tiger, pulling a cart with two arms as she crossed the other pair over her chest. \u201cHe steal something from ya?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, not exactly, but he *definitely* owes me. You know whereabouts I\u2019d find the little bastard?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m going past there now. Wanna tag along?\u201d\n\nMarkus nodded. It was a mixed bag down here. Half the people made him fear for his life, the other half almost didn\u2019t seem that bad.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on kitchen duty the last couple days. Only reason I know is because the other imps won\u2019t shut up about it. Half of them fucking hate him. The other half\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Markus chuckled. \u201cHate him more?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah. Not exactly.\u201d The four-armed tigeress grabbed her cart and resumed pulling, and Markus started following after. \u201cThere\u2019s two factions down here. I don\u2019t know much about it, though. I ain\u2019t worked here long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, and here I thought everyone here was Drathok\u2019s slave. He paying you?\u201d\n\nTigeress rolled her eyes, marching forwards as she spoke, keeping pace with Markus easily. \u201cOf *course* he\u2019s paying me, stupid. Imp barons bind *imps* to their service. They\u2019re not capable of just *forcing* whoever they want to work for them free of charge.\u201d She seemed to falter for a second, rubbing her fuzzy chin as she pulled the cart along. \u201cWell, Drathok might be the exception there, but he still *doesn\u2019t*. Everyone gets paid here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the imps?\u201d\n\n\u201c*Especially* the imps. He\u2019s got a soft spot for \u2018em, clearly. First I heard of a demon giving anything to their bound servants willingly. Fucking *weird* if you ask me.\u201d\n\nHuh. There it was again. \u2018Drathok keeps us safe\u2019, right? Well, shame that same sentiment didn\u2019t seem to apply to *anyone* outside of his immediate workforce. Plus whatever this faction stuff was about. \n\nMaybe there were two sides to that story. The way that imp had made it sound, Drathok was an evil torturer, and when Drathok had even suspected that Markus might\u2019ve been screwed over by said imp, he\u2019d offered Markus the right to murder the hell out of him.\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. Kinda conflicting sentiments.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like outside this place?\u201d Markus asked as they walked.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re one of *those* poor souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we that common?\u201d Markus asked, kinda grossed out by the notion.\n\n\u201cSummons from other worlds are all the rage these days. Firrelia has a variety of races, but creatures from other worlds are usually pretty different, and usually *way* weaker.\u201d She nodded, a wry smile on her face. \u201cPeople here *really* love a power trip, and seeing weak aliens struggle versus their big spooky monsters seems to scratch that itch pretty good. Bonus points if a Firrelian warrior goes and kills the monster right after.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cFucked up? Yeah. But what isn\u2019t in this world?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cEh, I guess not everywhere\u2019s this bad. Sun City\u2019s a cesspool. Not the *worst* in this zone but far from the best, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me guess, zones are like\u2026 regions? With different levels of monsters and stuff?\u201d\n\nTigress blinked twice. \u201c*Huh*, you know your shit. Wouldn\u2019t have expected that from an otherworlder.\u201d\n\nMarkus gave a small shrug. \u201cJust made sense. D Grade monster from a D Grade Zone? That\u2019s what they said during my first fight.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s basically how it works. I mean, there\u2019s more to it than that, zones are divided by which gods and kings have control of them and\u2014wait hold on a sec.\u201d She screeched to a stop with the cart. A crate fell off. Her eyes bugged. \u201cDid you just say you fought a D Grade monster in your *first fight* here?\u201d A beat. She stared at him closer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re *alive*?\u201d\n\nMarkus looked her over even as he bent down to pick up the fallen crate. \u201cWell, yeah. That\u2019s what I said.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nMarkus couldn\u2019t help but smirk a little as he placed the box back inside. \n\n\u201cWay.\u201d\n\n\u201cFfff\u2014\u201d She looked away from her cart, put it down entirely, looked him up and down properly for the first time since they\u2019d started talking. \u201cFuck, dude. That\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\nMarkus felt as if he\u2019d just walked into a brick wall. He stumbled and skid to a halt. His Mana Generation might\u2019ve just spiked again, that or he had butterflies. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 what?\u201d\n\nThe six foot five tigeress with four arms bit her lip, averted her eyes, put a pair of hands on her hips, and waved away what she\u2019d said with yet another hand. Or was she\u2026 *fanning herself*?\n\n\u201cI mean, y\u2019know. I didn\u2019t mean to just *blurt* that. Sure, I know you\u2019ve been kidnapped from your world and that must *really* suck for you\u2026 but a D Grade monster? Holy fuck. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nShe honestly looked as if she\u2019d turned a bit red. Markus *felt* red. Where the fuck was this coming from all of a sudden?!\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you even do that? You\u2019re like, human. No offense. But like, yeah. Are humans from your world just built different or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh, I dunno. *Maybe*?\u201d This might\u2019ve been the most out of place conversation ever. How had they gotten here so quickly?\n\n\u201cBecause you know, like, D Grade monsters are like *elite* hunter level. The kind you pay in gold, not silver. You must be *super* strong. You don\u2019t look it. You\u2019re tiny compared to me. That\u2019s so surprising\u2026 I wonder if it\u2019d hurt if you stepped on me?\u201d\n\nWhat was that, a fucking invitation?! Markus fought against the blush assailing his cheeks, awash in non-stop flattery. \n\n\u201cWhat is it? The powerful fighter thing or the creature from another world thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, both!\u201d Her tail swished as she spoke. It was bushy and huge and looked like it could wrap fully around him. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love an underdog story? I\u2019ve always wanted to see a summoned fighter beat this place. It never happens. Some might last for a while, but then\u2026\u201d \n\nSuddenly, she seemed to sober a little. It was as if her own words had knocked her out of a trance. The reality of the situation set in for them both, and Markus cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m planning to do just that. So maybe you\u2019ll get what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was getting what I wanted right now, we wouldn\u2019t be stood here talking,\u201d she said, and Markus almost choked on air.\n\nHe decided to think the best of it. Maybe she just meant she\u2019d rather not be working! Markus found that easier to accept than the prospect of how hard she was flirting with him right now. He\u2019d mentally prepared for a lot of things when it came to facing this dungeon, and this wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nNot that he necessarily hated it, but that was besides the point.\n\n\u201cAnyways, look! We\u2019re here already! Didn\u2019t that go fast?\u201d\n\nYeah. Positively *flew* by.\n\n\u201cIf you wait here, he\u2019ll come out eventually. You\u2019re best off not just barging in. Anyways, I\u2019ve gotta go deliver these boxes, but we should meet up at some point. I\u2019ve got a vested interest in your survival, now.\u201d\n\nShe walked right past him, brushing him with her tail as she left. \u201cI\u2019ll look for you tomorrow. Try not to die in the meantime!\u201d\n\nMan, that was quickly becoming like a catchphrase regarding him, and Markus wasn\u2019t sure he liked it\u2026\n\nStill, fuck. A lot had just happened there. A lot that made his ears feel hot. Markus felt as if he\u2019d just acquired a fan.\n\nA slightly overzealous fan, maybe, and one that seemed like she wanted to jump him, but a fan nonetheless, and he\u2019d been needing that. He figured more had to come of this than bad, even if he was slightly terrified.\n\nAlso flattered. Like, wow. \n\n*Okay, Markus, focus. You\u2019ve got a mission. A reason you came here. Last I checked, that mission isn\u2019t daydreaming about flights of fancy. It\u2019s getting some leverage. Time to do the mission, and get your damn head out of the clouds*.\n\nThat determination stayed for all of two minutes. Wasn\u2019t long until he was thinking about all the people out there that might see him the same way or differently. \n\nHe hated the arena goers. He was sure of that. Didn\u2019t matter if they booed or if they cheered for him, the fact they even attended was reason enough to despise them. \n\nThis was different, though. She just worked here. She wanted him to live because she thought it\u2019d be awesome if he did. He shared that sentiment. It *would* be fucking awesome to get through this in one piece.\n\nHe spent the time he had waiting attempting to Meditate, sat against a wall overlooking the double doors that led into the kitchen of the dungeon\u2019s food hall. \n\nIt was something he\u2019d started working on the night before, something he\u2019d gotten at least the very least slightly competent at focussing on, and Markus had at least managed to figure out how to heal specific parts of his body in that time, directing particular attention to his worst cuts and gashes and a fair amount of time to trying to repair his broken nose.\n\nHe\u2019d also had Ember help him out a bit. She was more than happy to, to the point that he didn\u2019t have to ask or direct her at all. That said, he felt bad getting her to do more than the minimum. She was helping him, and he ought to help her. He resolved to bring her something tasty when he next returned to his cell.\n\nThat said, the sensation of rapid healing was insane. It kinda itched, but in a good way? Like an itch that was being satisfied even as it appeared. He couldn\u2019t properly describe it, but the feeling was pretty satisfying. Not to the degree that he *wanted* to hurt himself just to get to do it more, but he was sure he wouldn\u2019t have a choice in getting injured a thousand more times, and if this process was waiting for him on the other side, that at least made the prospect a little less daunting.\n\nPlus, his pain tolerance had grown since absorbing the goblin soul. That only helped matters.\n\nAnd the increase in Spirit meant he could sit here in Meditation for a good long while without getting bored or sleepy. Which was good, because he\u2019d been waiting for at least an hour now, maybe longer, and those doors hadn\u2019t opened once.\n\nHe was almost starting to wonder if he was waiting in the wrong place. He got up for a minute to look around, but he couldn\u2019t see any other doors in sight. He thought about peeking in, but remembering the tigress\u2019 words about going in there, he held off, plonking himself straight back down and returning to his Meditation.\n\nHe decided to focus more on the part he\u2019d been finding most difficult, yet the part he imagined would wind up being the most rewardnig, *cycling* his mana.\n\nIt was an extremely difficult process. He\u2019d only recently learned how to move his mana from one part of his body to another, or how to isolate different kinds of mana within his body, but he found that certain kinds of mana were more receptive to movement than others. Divine Mana stayed within his navel at all times and he couldn\u2019t budge it. \n\nHe felt as if he could let it all out in an instant if he wanted to, but he\u2019d have no control over the rate at which he did so and after he\u2019d finished, it\u2019d all be gone. He imagined that was something to do with the Grade, but it could\u2019ve been the type also. Markus imagined this kind of stuff wasn\u2019t easy to find information about. Most people weren\u2019t Mana Manipulators and had likely never even met one, so he doubted information about how to specifically wield different mana types was in heavy supply.\n\nThat being said, Divine Mana was easily the hardest for him to utilise, but Spirit and Frost Mana were both pretty easy for him to maneouvre and play with. \n\nHe soon found that the first secret to cycling mana wasn\u2019t simply to isolate a specific kind of mana and move it within himself, but to compress it, then allow it to breathe, to repeatedly push it into a tight ball and then uncoil that buildup and allow the mana to flow through his body. \n\nWhen he did so, he found he could release a small portion from his body with reasonable effort, though it got a tiny bit easier every time. In time, he found himself able to release both Frost and eventually Flame Mana from his body in incredibly small doses, enough so that he was ticking down in mana *ever so slightly* more than he was ticking up from his natural generation.\n\nIt was a start. Not anywhere near the limits of what he felt he might be able to accomplish once he\u2019d mastered cycling, but it was a start. When he looked within himself, he could see the mana within his own body, but everything else around him felt black. He felt that wasn\u2019t right. \n\nThat if he trained his senses for long enough, he might be able to experience the mana even beyond himself and understand it better. It was an internal feeling, and he couldn\u2019t be sure if it was correct, but he trusted it implicitly, for it was what his gut told him.\n\nAnd when all of your power was basically contained within your gut, you kinda learned to trust it. His instincts had been keeping him alive up til now, at least.\n\nThe first thing to break Markus\u2019 focus was a level up. Who knew he could even level from things other than fighting?\n\nHe didn\u2019t get a point in Greater Meditation, or anything like that, but a full level. It seemed that Meditation was an activity that counted to his overall experience, and unlike other abilities, this one could only be upgraded by upgrading other things that contributed to it, rather than simply by continuous use. Perhaps it was because it was something he\u2019d gained from a Path?\n\nHe was mulling it over as he looked over his skill points and considered where to stick them until finally, finally, the doors ahead of him swung open, and Markus caught a glimpse of the most massive kitchen he ever did see.\n\nGordon Ramsay would be jealous. This was truly Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and it resembled a blazing inferno inside. A massive wrought-iron furnace with massive spits of meat over it surrounded lengthy cooking stations that teemed with imps and other demonic creatures that Markus didn\u2019t recognise at a glance. The room was filled with anger, sweat, and more curse words than one might find in a sailor\u2019s convention, and what accompanied all of that was the notes of the most complex and mouth-watering aromas Markus had smelled in years\u2026\n\nOr perhaps he was simply starving after days of subsisting off of basically nothing. Hard to tell.\n\nOh well. He wasn\u2019t here for food, even if he kinda wanted to be.\n\nThe moment the little shit came out those doors, Markus entered stealth mode, which is another way of saying that he put his hands over his face in an effort to not be seen.\n\nShockingly, it didn\u2019t work out very well.\n\nThe instant the imp saw him sat there, he bolted, and Markus took off in quick pursuit.\n\nNeedless to say he caught some eyes as he rounded the corner and cut off the little creature\u2019s escape, but that nasty fucker wasn\u2019t half as fast as he was insane, and stopping him in his path was a lot easier than Markus had anticipated it being.\n\n\u201cHey! I\u2019ll call for help! I\u2019m not afraid of you, you overgrown hairless ape!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, keep your fucking voice down!\u201d Markus shh\u2019d him, grabbing his wrist and yanking him to an adjacent corridor. \n\nThe moment Markus grabbed him, he allowed a pulse of mana to pass between them. It went off just as easily as he\u2019d hoped.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this about?! And why the *fuck* am I still alive if you survived, anyways?\u201d He dug his claws into Markus\u2019 wrist, but Markus continued to hold him in place regardless, unfettered. \u201cYou just wanted to do me yourself, is that it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you please keep it down?\u201d\n\n\u201cWELL COME ON THEN YA BASTARD, I\u2019LL GLADLY WELCOME DEATH IF IT MEANS I DON\u2019T HAVE TO SCRUB ANOTHER BOWL FOR THAT POMPOUS RED CU\u2014\u201d\n\nMarkus grabbed him by the neck, cutting him off entirely.\u201cFucking shut it, or I will kill you. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d\n\nSilence on the other end. Sounded like for all of his bravado, he didn\u2019t like the sound of that too much.\n\nGood. He deserved to sweat a bit after what he did.\n\n\u201cNow listen,\u201d Markus waited a second, made sure no one was coming to check on them. Luckily, the kitchen was so loud with the doors open that it was likely the commotion hadn\u2019t brought them much attention at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t ratfuck you after what you did to me, and I fucking well should have. You deserved everything you had coming to you for what you did to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrathok\u2026 deserved to lose you\u2026\u201d\n\nFuck, how hard was his grip? He let up a little, making sure the prick could breathe. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t trust you one bit, but you owe me, and if you want me to keep our shared past a secret from here on out, then I need a favour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m meant to do you a favour after you throttle me! Well isn\u2019t that a *wonderful* fucking idea! Should I *thank* you for choking me, too? Would that make you feel like a big man? Would it?!\u201d\n\nGod, this guy was awful. He couldn\u2019t wait to have this shit over with.\n\n\u201cYou owe me,\u201d Markus repeated, his voice stern. \u201cThis isn\u2019t up for negotiation. Help me or I\u2019ll drag you to that master you hate so much right now and you can explain how you nearly got me killed. Your choice.\u201d\n\n\u201c...fine. What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a way back to the lower levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 why? You think there\u2019s a way out down there or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about right now. There\u2019s monsters down there, and I wanna get stronger.\u201d Markus lowered his voice. \u201cBut I can\u2019t get down there on my own. There\u2019s always guards posted near the stairs and it\u2019s pretty clear they don\u2019t just let people wander off down there. I need you to help get me in. Make it look like you\u2019re taking me somewhere, or something.\u201d\n\nHe waited as the imp processed what he was saying, as the gears in his brain began to turn. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked, looking as if he were surprised. The cracks in his weathered face began to shift into a smile; it was like watching a dead planet terraform. \u201cThat\u2019s easy! I don\u2019t have to walk you down there! I can just do this!\u201d\n\nMarkus went to ask what \u2018this\u2019 was, but he didn\u2019t need to. The imp began channelling, his body glowing purple, and within three or four seconds, the two of them had vanished from the spot, reappearing in the dark depths below.\n\nThe moment they did, the imp pulled a torch from his belt and struck it. \n\n\u201cThis was it? This was all you wanted?\u201d\n\nMarkus instantly heard the sounds of various creatures springing to life around him, his heart pumping faster as he instantly realised how imminent the danger had suddenly become.\n\nHe steeled himself. Whatever was down here couldn\u2019t be worse than the trimander he\u2019d faced, or it\u2019d be valuable enough to be locked away. Or maybe that was bullshit reasoning. All he knew was that if he wanted out of this place, he needed to get significantly stronger, and waiting for arena fights that were under the control of Drathok alone was only playing into his hands. He needed to create his own edge if he wanted to end up on top, and that was exactly what he was going to do here.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m good with this. Keep that torch burning while I fight. I know the light keeps them away, and I wanna be able to run if I need to.\u201d\n\nMarkus took a couple of steps, and the imp immediately started laughing. When he turned back, his body was glowing purple once more.\n\n\u201cHeh, you really are fucking stupid, aren\u2019t you? You need me to get in and out of this place. Well what if I just leave?! Good luck telling Drathok what I did when you\u2019re sat in the bellies of fifty different monsters! Stupid fucking human, hahahahaha!\u201d\n\nThe imp continued to channel his teleport, intent on leaving victorious, allowing Markus to fight and struggle in this place losing himself in endless corridors until he eventually succumbed to his wounds and died.\n\nMarkus only grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why the fuck wouldn\u2019t I?!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Markus tapped his glaive, and the imp immediately clutched his chest, the purple glow around his body dissipating.\n\n\u201cWh-what the fuck did you do?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI learned a skill yesterday,\u201d Markus started, slowly walking towards him. \u201cIt\u2019s called Detonate.\u201d He smiled wider as he approached, leaning down and staring at him. \u201cI read all about it. It\u2019s a pretty cool ability. It requires prolonged contact, and it costs a bit of mana, but what it does is pretty simple\u2026\u201d\n\nHe tapped the glaive again, sending another pulse through the imp\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cIt blows shit the fuck up. And if you do *anything* to fuck with me while I\u2019m down here, just know\u2026\u201d\n\nOne more tap for good measure. The imp dropped to his knees.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re listening. What will I do if you try to fuck with me?\u201d\n\n\u201c...blow me the fuck up?\u201d\n\n\u201cBingo.\u201d\n\nThere. To say that was satisfying was a fucking understatement. \n\nThat matter settled, Markus immediately got to work on finding the first band of monsters he could unapologetically murder. \n\n//\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d410lk/harmless_human_sacrifice/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1dkqtbk/harmless_human_sacrifice_21/) | Next | [Next (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/silverdawnwrites)\n\n**A/N: Revenge is sweet.

Whether it is trying out clearly poisonous plants or playing around with the forces beyond their understanding.\n\nThey call it \u201ccuriosity\u201d. \n\nWe call that \u201chumanity\u201d.\n\nAll the species in the known universe approach existence with the cautious and mindful eye. Any sign of danger will be reported, analyzed and documented for future studies.\n\nCountless worlds have developed their senses and build their biology around the ability to detect danger before it comes anywhere near them. That\u2019s what allowed us to thrive and develop.\n\nHumans will ignore the clear signs of danger. In fact, they seem *drawn* to the danger. \n\nThey call it \u201cthrill\u201d.\n\nWe call it insanity.\n\nOr humanity.\n\nThe terms are quite interchangeable in over two hundred galaxies.\n\nBut even humans should\u2019ve known better than try to get in touch with the Kn\u2019\u00f8\u0175n. The species - if that term could even be applied to those monster - existed on an entirely different planet of reality. They didn\u2019t act or even think in any way that could be related or understood by us or anyone in the existing world.\n\nSo when humanity started sending out the signals into the greater cosmos, we sent them a warning.\n\nDon\u2019t, we said.\n\nThey will hear you, we warned.\n\nYou\u2019ll bring them here, we begged.\n\nOur pleas fell on deaf ears.\n\nOur worst fears came to life.\n\nThe Kn\u2019\u00f8\u0175n came and tore through the Milky Way like grocustian growms through the greenery. Not out of malice. Not out of hatred. Not out of fear.\n\nBut simply out of curiosity.\n\nWhat would happen if all oceans turned into acid for just a few seconds? What would it be like if the course of time was reversed? What if the fundamental laws of physics were thrown to the wind?\n\nKn\u2019\u00f8\u0175n treated Earth like their personal playground.\n\nBut they never expected humanity to outplay them.\n\nNeither did we. Neither did anyone. \n\nJust like the monsters treated humans as an experiment. The humans treated the monsters as a mystery.\n\nHumans don\u2019t love mysteries.\n\nThey may love the romanticism of it. But when they see something they don\u2019t understand, they will stop at nothing until the mystery is cut open on an operating table and studied down to nothing.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what they did with the Kn\u2019\u00f8\u0175n.\n\nHow much radiation can the monsters absorb? How much information can they retain? Do their bodies have flesh and blood? Can their flesh and blood be cooked and consumed to gain their powers? Can they be turned against each other? Can they be broken down and conquered?\n\nThe Kn\u2019\u00f8\u0175n were curious creatures.\n\nBut humans were the masters of curiosity.\n",
