        "content": "##Content Theft\n\nGreetings citizens of HFY! This is your friendly Modteam bringing you a (long overdue) PSA about stolen content narrated and uploaded on YouTube/TikTok without your express permission. With the increased availability of AI resources, this is sadly becoming more and more common. This post is intended to be a resource and reference for all community members impacted by content theft.\n\n###What is happening:\n\nLong story short, there are multiple YouTube and TikTok (and likely other platforms, but those are the main two) accounts uploading HFY Original Content and plagiarizing it as their own work, or reproducing it on their channel without permission. As a reminder to everyone, **reproducing someone else's work in any medium without their permission is plagiarism,** and is not only a bannable offence but may also be **illegal.** Quite often these narrations are just AI voices over generic images and/or Minecraft footage (which is likely also stolen), meaning they are just the lowest possible attempt at a cash grab or attention. That is, of course, not to say that even if the narrator uses their own voice that it still isn't content theft.\n\nWe do have a number of lovely narration channels, [listed here in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/audio) who do ask nicely and get permission to use original content from this subreddit, so please check them out if you enjoy audio HFY!\n\nSome examples of this activity:\n\nStolen Content Thread #1: [Here](https://redd.it/o3ufp2)  \nStolen Content Thread #2: [Here](https://redd.it/15g7nnf)  \nStolen Content Thread #3: [Here](https://redd.it/15j35w4)  \nStolen Content Thread #4: [Here](https://redd.it/1760tv3)  \nStolen Content Thread #5: [Here](https://redd.it/1bgvr9h)\n\n###What to do about it:\n\n**If you are an author** who finds your work has been narrated without your permission, there are a few steps to take. Unfortunately, the mods here at Reddit have no legal methods to do so on your behalf on a different platform, you must do this yourself.\n\nYou as the author, regardless of what platform you post you story on, always own the copyright. If someone is doing something with it in its entirety without your permission, you have the right to take whatever measures you see fit to have it removed from the platform. Especially if they intend to profit off of said content. If no credit is given to the original author, then it is plagiarism in addition to IP theft. And not defending your copyright can make it harder for you to defend it in the future, which is why so many big companies take an all or nothing approach to enforcement (this is somewhat dependent on your geographical location, so you may need to check your local legislation).\n\n* **YouTube**: Sign in to your YouTube account and go to the YouTube studio of your account. There is the option of submitting a copyright claim. Copy and paste the offending video link and fill out the form. Put your relationship to the copyright as original author with your info and submit. It helps to change the YouTube channel name to your reddit name as well before issuing the strike.\n\n  * You can also state your ownership in the comments to bring attention from the casual viewer of the channel who probably doesn't know this is stolen work.\n\n* **TikTok**: If you find a video that\u2019s used your work without your consent you can report it here: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright\n\n  * You can also state your ownership in the comments to bring attention from the casual viewer of the channel who probably doesn't know this is stolen work.\n\n**If you are not an author directly affected**, do *not* attempt to fill copyright claims or instigate official action on behalf of an author, this can actually hamper efforts by the author to have the videos removed. Instead, inform the original author about their stolen work. Please do not harass these YouTube/TikTok'ers. We do not want the authors' voices to be drowned out, or to be accused of brigading.\n\n**If you are someone who would like to narrate stories you found here**, simply ask the author for permission, and respect their ownership if they say no.\n\n**If you are someone who has posted narrated content without permission**, delete it. Don't ever do it again. Feel ashamed of yourself, and ask for permission in the future.\n\nTo all the users who found their way here to r/hfy thanks to YouTube and TikTok videos like the ones discussed above: Hello and welcome! We're glad that you managed to find us! That does not change the fact that what these YouTube/TikTok'ers are doing is legally and morally in the wrong.\n\n---\n\n##FAQ regarding story narration and plagiarism in general:\n\n- \"But they posted it on a public website (reddit), that means I can do whatever I want with it because it's free/Public Domain!!\"\n\nThe fact that it is posted in a public place does **not** mean that the author has relinquished their rights to the content. [Public Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) is a very specific legal status and must be directly and explicitly applied by the author, or by the age of the story. Unless they have explicitly stated otherwise, they reserve ALL rights to their content by default, other than those they have (non-exclusively) licensed to Reddit. This means that you are free to read their content here, link to it, but you can **not** take it and do something with it, any more than you could (legally) do with a blockbuster Disney movie or a professionally published paperback. A work only enters the public domain when the copyright expires (thanks to The Mouse, for newly published work this is effectively never), or when the author explicitly and intentionally severs their rights to the IP and releases the work into the public domain. A work isn't \"public domain\" just because someone put it out for free public viewing any more than a book at your local library is.\n\n- \"But if it's on reddit they aren't making money from it, so why should they care if someone else does?\"\n\nThis is doubly wrong. In the first place, there *are* many authors in this community who make money on their writing here, so someone infringing on their copyright *is* a threat to their income. We're aware of several that don't just do this as a side-hustle, but they stake their entire livelihood on it: it is their full-time job. In their case, it could literally be a threat to their *life*.\n\nSecondly and perhaps more importantly, even if the author *wasn't* making money from their writing and never did, *it doesn't matter.* Their writing is *their writing*, belonging to them, and unless they explicitly grant permission to someone to reproduce it elsewhere (which, FYI, is a right that most authors here would be happy to grant if asked), **nobody** has the right to reproduce that work. Both as a matter of copyright law, and as a matter of ethics--they worked hard on that, and they ought to be able to control when and where their work is used if they choose to enforce their rights.\n\n- \"How is this any different than fan fiction, they're just showing their appreciation for a story they like?\"\n\nMost of these narration channels are simply taking the text as-is and reading it verbatim. There's not a mote of transformative work involved, nothing new is added to the underlying ideas of the story. In a fanfiction, the writer is at least putting a new spin on existing characters or settings--though even in that case, [copyright law is still not squarely in their favor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction).\n\n- \"Okay so this might normally be a copyright violation, but they're reading it in a new medium, so it's fair use!\"\n\nOne of our community members wrote up a great explanation about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/o36563/what_happened_to_the_creator_of_the_pink_series/h2ft4qw/) that will be reproduced below. To summarize, for those who don't click through: no, it's not [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html). Copyright fully applies here.\n\n> This is not fair use, in any sense of the term. A public forum is not permission to repost and redistribute, unless that forum forces authors to grant a license that allows for it. An example often brought up in that respect is the SCP wiki, which sets all included work to be under a creative commons license.\n\n> That is not the case for Reddit, which grants no such licenses or permissions. Reading text aloud is not significant enough change to be a transformative work, which removes allowances that make things like fanfiction legal. Since this is not transformative work, it is not fair use as a parody.\n\n> Since money was involved, via Patreon and marketed goods, fair use allowances for educational purposes are greatly reduced, and no longer apply for fiction with an active copyright. (And if the author is still alive, the copyright is still active.)\n\n> There are four specific things that US copyright law looks at for fair use. Since Reddit, Youtube, and Patreon are all based in America, the relevant factors in the relevant legal code are:\n\n> 1. **Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes:** this youtube channel is for profit, using original fiction with no changes whatsoever to the story. No allowances for fair use under this point.\n> 2. **Nature of the copyrighted work:** the copywritten works are original fiction, and thus face much stricter reading of fair use compared to a news article or other nonfiction work. Again, no allowances for this case under this point.\n> 3. **Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:** The entire story is being narrated, and thus, this point is again a source of infringement on the author's rights.\n> 4. **Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:** The work is being monetized by the infringer, and is online in a way beyond the original author's control. This dramatically limits the original author's ability to publish or monetize their own work if they ever choose to do so, especially if they don't contest the existing monetization now that they're aware of them.\n\n> There is no reasonable reading of copyright or fair use that grants people permission to narrate and/or monetize a reddit post made by someone else. This is not the SCP wiki or stackexchange - the only license granted by the author is the one to Reddit themselves.\n\n> Publicly posting a story has never, at any point, been even remotely equivalent to granting the reader rights to do with it as they please, and anyone who believes such fundamentally misunderstands what \"public domain\" actually is.\n\n- \"Well it's pretty dickish for writers to tell these people to take their videos down, they're getting so much *exposure* from this!!\"\n\nIf a person does not enforce their rights when they find out that their copyright has been infringed, it can undermine their legal standing to challenge infringement later on, should they come across a new infringement they want to prosecute, or even just change their mind about the original perpetrator for whatever reason. Again, this can be dependent on geographic location. Not enforcing copyright can make a court case more complicated if it winds up in court, since selective enforcement of rights will give a defendant (unstable) ground to stand on.\n\nWith that in mind, it is simply prudent, good sense to clearly enforce their copyright as soon as they can. If an author doesn't mind other people taking their work and doing whatever they want with it, then they should *state that*, and publish it under a license such as Creative Commons (like SCP does). Also, it's really dickish to steal people's work for any purpose.\n\nAdditionally, many contracts for professional publishing require exclusivity, so something as simple as having an unknown narration out there could end the deal. Unless and until the author asserts their rights, they cannot sign the contract and receive money from publishing their work. i.e. this unasked for \"exposure\"  could directly cause them harm.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to u/sswanlake, u/Glitchkey, and u/AiSagOrSol3-43912 for their informative comments on this post and elsewhere; several of the answers provided in this PSA were strongly inspired by them.",

We got what we wanted but not what we needed.*\n\n*We should have made sure they were happy.* - u/Dra5iel, Telkan Philosopher, Spur-Wide Mar-gite War Era\n\nAdmiral Rippentear stood in the elevator, shaking his head slightly. He had an impressive pedigree for a Space Force Staff Officer. Nearly three centuries in uniform. He was openly proud of the fact that he had started as a Fire Control Crew Member on small destroyers, that he had been enlisted at the beginning of his career. He was proud of his slow movement through the ranks, through the schools, proud of his combat commands and his logistical commands with equal measure.\n\nHe considered himself a professional warrior. Trained in everything from board actions to damage control to leadership and ship piloting.\n\nWhich meant he had no illusions about the man he was going to see.\n\nThe elevator door opened to reveal a command center that buzzed with the low tones of quiet discussions. Over there military intelligence analysts consulted with Naval, Space Force, Marine, and Army intelligence, as well as Defense Intelligence. Right there the Creation Engine Oversight officers consulted with the commanders of logistics units all the way down to the Company level. Right there Games & Theory stood shoulder to shoulder with Operational Planning Division to watch the performance of equipment new and old.\n\nStanding off to the side, a large salted pretzel smeared with mustard in one hand and a narcobrew in the other, was an officer the majority of enemy forces would ignore.\n\nNo, enemy forces would concentrate on Admiral Sarah Fistenhammer, who looked like she had stepped off of a recruiting poster. If casting had sent her to an action film as the military commander of entire stellar regions the director would send her back with a nasty note about typecasting.\n\nBut Rippentear knew she was one of the Offensive Actions Board.\n\nThe true heart and brain of the Solarian Iron Dominion military forces was busy washing down a bite of his pretzel with thick rich narcobrew. He was short, slightly portly, with a weak chin, watery eyes, and a scraggly mustache. His top lay forgotten on a console, the award rack significant to anyone who could read the medal stack and thought that combat awards were all that mattered.\n\nIt lacked a single combat or valor award.\n\nNot even a basic Combat Action Award.\n\nWith the nametag Takilikakik on it.\n\nRippentear moved over next to the General, who smiled, nodded, and took another bite of the sea salt seasoned chewy soft pretzel.\n\n\"Dominion Command wants us to shake loose a task force to assist the Ornislarp Noocracy,\" Rippentear stated.\n\nThe General nodded and washed down the bite of pretzel with a long pull off of the beer bottle. \"I expected as much,\" he said once his mouth was empty. \"I have prepared eight different options for you and the War Council to look over.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" General Rippentear said. His implant pinged that he had a fairly large file waiting in his inbox from General Takilikakik.\n\n\"Mil-Int estimates a high probability that whoever is attacking the Ornislarp Noocracy is using weaponry they have reverse engineered or salvaged from Extinction Event wreckage and ruines,\" Takilikakik said. He took another bite of his pretzel and motioned at where the Defense Intelligence analysts were leaning in to look at combat footage provided by the Ornislarp was being analyzed by people instead of computer algorithms. Two digital sentiences glittered as they slowly moved around the holotank, looking at the data from different angles.\n\nRippentear waited a moment for Takilikakik to finish chewing.\n\n\"The most noticable, according to combat and tactical analysis sections, is that the weapons being used match the basic profiles of some of our heavier weapons, they are not used in the same interlocking method that our own forces use them,\" Takilikakik said. He shrugged. \"I'm not a combat man, but I trust the analysis of those who are.\"\n\n\"I'll look it over,\" Rippentear promised.\n\nTakilikakik took another bite and chewed slowly, nodding.\n\n\"How is the rearming and reinforcing going?\" Rippentear asked.\n\nTakilikakik swallowed, took another drink off of his narcobrew, and started moving toward the reclamator. Rippentear followed.\n\n\"We have nearly 32.5% of the cryo-troops thawed out. We're unthawing the older ones first so they can be trained on modern equipment,\" General Takilikakik said. \"Ship reactivation is at 64.81%, with the lighter ones being activated first.\"\n\n\"Creation Engine and Complex War Systems status?\" Rippentear asked.\n\n\"Creation Engine ignition is at 125%, we're into the reserve and backup units now. The Complex War Systems are at roughly 74.91% in aggregate. The Pacific Rim Class Jaegers are only at 28.44% activation, but those are some of the most complex,\" Takilikakik said. He dropped the bottle in the reclamation grinder.\n\nRippentear nodded.\n\n\"How is the political front going?\" Takilikakik asked.\n\nRippentear shook his head. \"Badly.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Takilikakik asked.\n\n\"Half of the Younger Races want us to surrender Afterlife to them and rejoin the Confederacy on their terms. The older races are all siding with us,\" Rippentear said. He sighed. \"Forty-thousand years and nobody has their shit together.\"\n\n\"Entropy sips at even closed systems,\" Takilikakik said. He moved over to the mass extractions and storage section, looking over the raw numbers for a moment, then moved away. \"As for Afterlife, they do know we don't have full control over it, right?\"\n\nRippentear shrugged. \"I don't think they fully believe us.\"\n\nTakilikakik shook his head. \"We haven't had any significant control over the system since the Glassing. They *have* to understand that TerraSol being bagged disrupted the control system just as much as the Atrekna's temporal warfare protocols did.\"\n\n\"They are convinced we're just holding back their deceased population to be petty,\" Rippentear said. \"Not the Elder Races. They get it. The Tukna'rn, they feel that in the absence of their own doctrine they will abide by our doctrine. The Hamaroosan are talking a big game, but backchannel they just want to be able to interview a few and ensure that they are being properly treated. Tnvaru has been silent on the issue in meetings even though their gestalt and public want access.\"\n\n\"And the Lanaktallan?\" Takilikakik asked.\n\nRippentear snorted. \"You know the Lanky. They're still debating on if the Lanaktallan who have been on Terra for the last fifty years should be considered modern Lankies or Ancient Lankies from the Second Precursor War.\"\n\nTakilikakik shook his head. \"That will take them a few centuries to figure out,\" he chuckled. \"Now that we're not fighting them, I actually like them.\"\n\n\"Tale as old as time,\" Rippentear admitted.\n\nRippentear looked over the hologram of the Galactic Arm Spur, reaching out to tap the Solarian Iron Dominion marker. It expanded into a box, showing force and readiness levels.\n\n\"Any chance I can convince you to slice off a super-colossus task force for me, Imak?\" he asked.\n\nGeneral Takilikakik chuckled. \"Actually,\" he said, pausing. Admiral Rippentear looked hopeful. \"I've done just that. Of course, you aren't going to like it.\"\n\n\"Anything other than standing here watching Sol burn,\" Rippentear said.\n\n\"19th Combat and Logistical Support Task Force. It's part of the options I gave you,\" General Takilikakik said. \"It's actually my recommended option.\"\n\n\"So why won't I like it?\" Rippentear asked.\n\n\"The Confederacy doesn't want us to run off and help the Ornislarp unilaterally. They want to 'help' us, like we forgot how to fight after fifty years,\" General Takilikakik said.\n\n\"Technology has advanced,\" Rippentear said, repeating the standard line that everyone had been instructed to repeat or remember.\n\nGeneral Takilikakik snorted. \"Yeah. It's regressed in many ways, but it doesn't matter,\" he looked at the ceiling. \"Like Trucker always said: Guns may fire twice as fast and twice as far as they did during The Glassing, but the average private is as drunk and stupid as ever.\"\n\nThat got some chuckled from the analysts and workers around them.\n\n\"The Confederacy thinks it will let them know just how far behind them we are,\" General Takilikakik said. \"In reality, it will let us fully gauge them. Weapon capability, drive speed, compensator strength, armor capability, logistical capability, and fighting strength.\"\n\nAdmiral Rippentear nodded. \"So we go in with limiters and governors.\"\n\nGeneral Takilikakik nodded. \"The reasoning of 'field adjustments' and 'field modernization' will cover raising the limitations on the war fighting material. If you're in trouble, don't hold back, slam the pedal to full flank speed and damn the public sodomy.\"\n\nAdmiral Rippentear smiled widely.\n\n\"The Confederacy is sending enough ships to triple the size of whichever task force is assigned to the Ornislarp front. When it comes to metal weight though,\" General Takilikakik shook his head. \"We will still outmass and outweigh them by a factor of sixteen.\"\n\nAdmiral Rippentear lifted up his datapad, crossloaded the file, and went through quickly. General Takilikakik went over to look over various stations, examine various status reports. The General got another pretzel, chewing on it as he wandered around it, encouraging subordinates, solving problems when he could, bringing experts into the loop to check results.\n\nWhile it was going on, Admiral Rippentear examined the options. Finally, he tapped the recommended profile and saved the file, uploading it to the server.\n\nGeneral Takilikakik heard the ping and checked it. He nodded it and looked at Admiral Rippentear.\n\n\"Good luck, Admiral,\" General Takilikakik said. He turned away to look over the new tesseract mass tank tests.\n\nAdmiral Rippentear turned and left the command center for the entire Solarian Iron Dominion.\n\nIn the elevator he smiled.\n\nIt'd be good to get back in the action.\n\nBack in the command center, General Takilikakik, Commanding Director of Solarian Iron Dominion Military Forces looked over force levels.\n\n0-0-0-0-0\n\nCorporal [Vak.tel](http://Vak.tel) was a Telkan Marine with nearly fifty-two years in Active Duty. He had been deployed twice to help put down riots on Telkan-1, he had even fought against the alien Chorethrun four times, once in a ship boarding action.\n\nNow he was on some emergency assignment that had diverted them from the military action against the Mar-gite and/or against whoever was building the Hellspace Wall.\n\nTrue, everyone had heard that mind-shattering roar when Terra had emerged from The Bag a little over a month ago, but he honestly didn't see why they had to redirect Task Force Smokey Viper and Task Force Green Podling to TerraSol.\n\nNow, three weeks after being diverted, both task forces were sitting almost a light year out from TerraSol, just hanging around in the middle of nothing, surrounded by the last little wisps of the Sol Oort Cloud and starlight and dark and jack and shit.\n\nWhich bugged the hell out of Corporal Vak.tel, he had been looking forward to some old ground and pound in the Telkan Marine Corps tradition. The Telkan Marine Corps had a reputation to uphold, and Vak.tel sure as hell felt like they weren't going to be upholding any martial traditions just sitting out in the middle of nothing.\n\nNow something even weirder was going on, but whatever it was, the brass wasn't telling him. He had heard rumors of a ship rendezvousing with the troop carrier or the troop carrier being detached from Task Force Smokey Viper.\n\nHe was he sitting down with the rest of his platoon, gossiping, checking out what rumor control had to say, when everyone went silent. He looked up and saw the Old Man, Field Colonel Shrekna, heading straight for his table.\n\n\"Shit,\" Cipdek muttered, shoveling the last of his food into his mouth.\n\nA glance told Vak.tel that the Light Colonel and the Captains were at the far end of the table.\n\nThe Old Man stopped next to the Light Colonel, tapping the table. He sat down and there was tight discussion.\n\nAfter a few minutes, all eight of the Telkani got up and left the dining hall.\n\nThat got chuckles, and more questions. Everyone was sure that something had just gone down. The Old Man, in charge of the entire Regiment, wouldn't normally come down to the mess hall unless something serious was up.\n\nThey had hit desserts before the pinging went off on everyone's datalinks.\n\nVak.tel checked his link and managed to keep from groaning out loud.\n\nHe was being re-assigned to a different troopship.\n\n\"Anyone ever heard of the ship called *The Warsteel Fist of Hated Fates*?\" he asked.\n\nThe others shook their heads. Everyone else in Kilo Company, 17th Rifle Battalion, 3rd Infantry Brigade, 6th Infantry Regiment, 7th Telkan Marine Division, had been assigned to the same ship. Any attempts at getting any information from the database came back as 'no data found' even when Gunny Heltok tried his military intelligence contacts.\n\nMuttering to himself, Vak.tel went back to his berth and started packing his shit.\n\n*Yeah, this is going to be fun*, he thought to himself. *Probably another assignment just sitting around with our thumbs up our asses instead of facing off against the enemy.*\n\nHe barely got packed before the muster time and hustled to the troop bay to board the transport.\n\n*Whole spur is at war and they pulled the best fighters in the Confederacy for some dumb shit*, he thought.\n\n\\[[First Contact](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[Dark Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16hzgya/the_dark_ages_01/)\\] \\[[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1aeebjr/nova_wars_prologue/)\\] \\[[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1dqb8gn/nova_wars_fm_2175/)\\] \\[Next\\] \\[[Wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

        "content": "Synopsis: Markus is summoned from Earth by evil beings looking for a 'weak and primitive' creature to use as sacrificial entertainment. What they got instead was a human. Immediately after arriving, Markus awakens to an ability so rare, so powerful that it makes every god on Firrelia desperate to recruit him as their new champion.\n\nLearning to control his innate mastery over mana, Markus will devour the very essence of any monster, demon, or god that dares get in his way, determined to never lose his freedom again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d410lk/harmless_human_sacrifice/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1dpxhxb/harmless_human_sacrifice_28/) | Next | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/silverdawnwrites) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/HMhUFzZwtc)  \n\n50 points into Strength, raising the stat to 100, and Markus felt the difference within his body immediately. A list of passives popped up right after:\n\n[**Pack Rat I (Common): Your carrying capacity far exceeds that of someone your build. Your ability to lift, haul, and drag objects for long distances is increased by 50%.**]\n\n[**Bully I (Common): Your unarmed strikes gain 20% speed. Your knuckles can absorb 33% more force than your Constitution would usually allow without breaking, allowing for more reckless and powerful unarmed strikes.**]\n\n[**Pride I (Epic): You are emboldened by combat, your Strength increasing by 10 points for an hour for each enemy you fell, capping at 100 points. While under the effects of Pride, enemies of your level or lower that attempt to flee from you will be revealed to you and slowed by 2% of your Strength within 30 feet of you, capping at 20%. While under the effects of Pride, your own movement will be slowed by 25% if you attempt to flee combat until you are 50 feet from your opponent.**]\n\n[**The effects of Pride may only be activated and deeactivated while out of combat.**]\n\nOkay, fuck this choice. 50 points in Agility before he made his mind up on that one.\n\n100 points in Agility, unlike Con or Strength, didn\u2019t give him a list of passives to choose from. Instead, like Spirit had, it simply gave him a dash skill, alongside 3 more points in Evasion, raising Evasion from 14 to 17.\n\n[**Dash I (Common): Your movement speed is passively increased by 12%. This can be increased to 30% for 30 seconds at the cost of 50 F Grade Life Mana. Dash has a one minute cooldown after the active ends, and passive movement buffs are removed while Dash is on cooldown.**]\n\nOkay, that settled it. Markus locked in Pride. \n\nHe could see the benefits to something like Pack Rat, but it was too future-thinking. Even if he might be able to use it to drag more loot around in the dungeons below, it sounded more like an endurance buff to carrying things long distances than anything that would directly increase his combat prowess. Great for pulling a cart, not so great for pulling a monster\u2019s head off.\n\nThen there was Bully. Fun to imagine running around beating everything up with just his fists, but some of the monsters he\u2019d ran into already made that prospect sound pretty much impossible to him, and he\u2019d already invested enough into his malichor blade that it felt it\u2019d be  absolutely stupid to take a class change right now. \n\nVersatility was surely a good trait to have, but for now he wanted to ensure he remained focussed on the things he already knew how to do well, the things that had done their jobs in keeping him alive so far. He could always round out his weaker points later. \n\nPride sounded a little dangerous to use, but only if he turned it on at stupid times. Besides, half of his fights were literally impossible to run from. He just needed to plan ahead a little to use that ability to its full potency.\n\nThat left Markus with 120 regular points and 254 free points. Still about 400 in total\u2026\n\nHe boosted Con to 200.\n\n[**Robust I has evolved to Robust II.**]\n\n[**Stone Skin I has evolved to Stone Skin II.**]\n\n[**Respite: 3 >> 4.**]\n\nThat and an extra thousand health marked the difference between now and before. It was a monumental change for sure, but 200 wasn\u2019t a breakpoint like 100 was, and Markus had spent 100 points to find as much out. \n\nNext one could be 250, it could be 500, it might not even be until 1000\u2026 He only had 300 points left. He wasn\u2019t yet sure if he was willing to use another 50 to stress test this further. More health was great and all until he got put versus something he couldn\u2019t damage, then he\u2019d only get to live those few hits longer to realise how stupid he was for dumping all his points in Con.\n\n120 regular, 154 free. His stats now looked like this:\n\n[**Name: Markus Brown**]\n\n[**Class:** **Otherworlder (Earth) (Tier: Novice 45)**]\n\n[**Health: 1870/2060**]\n\n[**Mana: 7908/5570**]\n\n[**Strength: 130 (+30)**]\n\n[**Agility: 130 (+30)**]\n\n[**Arcana: 20**]\n\n[**Constitution: 230 (+30)**]\n\n[**Spirit: 150**]\n\n[**???: 0**]\n\nOkay. Big Arcana dump time. Straight to 100. Time to see what the fuck that did.\n\n[**Magical affinity: 0 >> 1.**]\n\n[**Mana Control: 1 >> 3.**]\n\n[**Cryomancy: 9 >> 12. Mastery unlocked.**]\n\n[**Hemomancy: 3 >> 6.**]\n\n[**Pyrokinesis: 3 >> 6.**]\n\n[**Stone Skin II has evolved to Stone Barrier I**.]\n\n[**Manifest: 4 >> 5. Path Unlocked.**]\n\n[**Adaptive Resistance I unlocked.**]\n\nOkay, that right there was a fucking lot.\n\nFirst off, what was Magical Affinity?\n\n[**Magical Affinity: Affects your general ability to understand and process magic and mysticism. Ability to learn magical secrets via study and osmosis are affected directly by Magical Affinity, which increases Growth in all magical pursuits by 4% per point, and allows for unlocks of increasingly complex magical subclasses at certain breakpoints. This trait governs Enchanting, Crafting, Forging, Artifice, Spellcraft, Alchemy, Rituals, and Rune Carving.**]\n\nOkay, shit. That just opened a lot of doors for him. Not exactly great for an arena fight, probably, but if he survived, he had a lot of pies he\u2019d be able to dip his fingers into, assuming he could find a way to learn about any of that stuff.\n\nThen there was Adaptive Resistance: \n\n[**Adaptive Resistance I: Allow your body to build a moderate resistance to a single element for a mana type you can generate, or a minor resistance to a mana type you cannot generate but have access to. A resistance take ten minutes to generate and lasts until switched or until the corresponding mana type is depleted. Requires mana of Grade D or higher.**]\n\nOkay, shit, this was pretty dope. D Grade kinda made it a bit harder to use than some of his other stuff, but the idea of being able to prepare for his fights in such a manner\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, Lexi.\u201d\n\nShe blinked up at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure you can\u2019t remember what I\u2019m fighting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d she rubbed her chin as she mulled the prospect over. Eventually, she raised a finger, gasping with a start. \u201cOh! It\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\nShe slumped down onto the floor, resting her chin on her palm. \u201cShit. I lost it again. Sorry.\u201d\n\nWell, fuck it. Markus chose to make himself resistant to fire. Seemed like a fairly safe bet.\n\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t apologise. How long have I got, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 About ten minutes. You ate pretty fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cooked pretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cook those!\u201d Lexi said, batting away his complement. \u201cI just fetched them. I\u2019m terrible in a kitchen. If you want broken shells in your eggs, I\u2019m your go-to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Markus laughed, eyes flicking back to his screen. She wasn\u2019t rushing him out of the door, which was nice, but he still needed to get a move on. The fact he\u2019d ran down twenty minutes just making the decisions he did was worrisome. He was pretty sure being late to his scheduled fight wasn\u2019t an option, either. Lexi would use that chain spell thingy to pull him there eventually if she had to.\n\nCryomancy unlocked a mastery. What were his choices?\n\n[**Freeze Ray I (Arcana+): Channel the Frost Mana within you into a chilling blast that inflicts ice damage upon enemies within a 30 degree cone and inflicts Freeze II upon enemies your size or smaller for one minute. Requires E Grade Frost Mana. Size of cone and duration of Freeze affected by Arcana.**]\n\n[**Frozen Sanctuary I (Spirit+): When stood within cold spaces, your Frost Mana generation doubles.**]\n\n[**Cold Heart I: Your movement across icy surfaces is bolstered. Movement speed is  increased by 5% while standing on ice, balance is proportionately increased, and effective Agility while standing on ice is increased by 8%**.]\n\nThere were more, and Markus wasn\u2019t sure which to pick. He shelved the choice. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d use any of these in the upcoming battle, and he could always come back to this on the walk to the arena if needed, or maybe make a split second choice before the fight started.\n\nHe was very aware of his time limit, and Mastery choices were so far spanning that he\u2019d be scrolling through this list forever if he wasn\u2019t wary. That in mind, he moved on to Manifest\u2019s Path selection.\n\n[**Complexity (Epic): Your mind has a greater recall for the dimensions and shapes of objects, allowing you to more effectively conjure manifestations that fit your needs.**]\n\n[**Duration: (Epic): Allows your manifestations to remain tangible for up to five more seconds after you lose focus on them.**]\n\n[**Increase (Legendary): Allows you to immediately double the size of a manifested object, assuming said object is under five feet in length, three feet in width, and four feet in height.**]\n\nFuck, these all sounded good. Which was best? That was really difficult to say. Complexity, maybe?\n\nNo. Even if it might solve a major hurdle for Markus, he was sure that learning to memorise the minute details of objects was something he was capable of doing if he studied objects and really practiced hard enough. Sure, it\u2019d probably get him into that tricky chest he\u2019d hauled in here much faster, but that was about it.\n\nAnother decision to delay. He wanted to be sure about this one before he selected it, even if he had a bias in his head right now. He wanted to practice more with said ability before he locked anything in, because while he could see the applications of both options, his Manifest prowess was a bit of a fucking joke right now. He could make sticks and poles and straight, *long* sticks that kind of resembled narrow ramps.\n\nOh, and he could cover his face. Nothing there he really wanted to double or increase the duration of *too* badly, though he could definitely see the use.\n\nThen there was [Stone Barrier], the evolution of his Stone Skin spell. What was the deal there?\n\n[**Stone Barrier I:** **Using 500 (F Grade) Earth and Spirit Mana, shield your body in a protective coat of stone, or summon a stone wall between yourself and a target that lasts for up to 30 seconds or until smashed through. Stone coating affords moderate protection against physical attacks, major protection versus lightning, and moderate protection versus heat. Strength and duration of Stone Barrier are modified by Arcana.**]\n\nWhoa. Cost shot way up. But he could erect stone walls now? That and the increase in physical damage reduction made this pretty fucking dope, but he didn\u2019t exactly have a constant source of Earth Mana to spam this ability with. Even the entire creature he\u2019d drained had only given him enough Earth Mana for perhaps one cast of this ability in its current form!\n\nAnd while he could affix the core he\u2019d gotten from it, that was something he imagined would give him way less mana than he needed. Maybe he\u2019d generate enough for one cast per day if he was lucky.\n\nSpeaking of cores, it was about time he went through them.\n\nMarkus had absorbed 25 cores in his time down in the dark, and once he\u2019d sorted through all of them, his mana had ticked up by another 900, his Agility had increased by 12, his Strength by 6, his Constitution by 9, and his Spirit by 3.\n\nTwelve cores from bats, six came from rats, three came from giants, two came from bears, one from a slime monster, and a partridge in a pear tree.\n\nHold on. One came from wall chameleon. That was 25.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t looked at combining or affixing them yet. Too much work and not enough time. \n\n120 regular points, 74 free. He rounded out all the uneven stats, spending 20 points in the process. With that done, the sheet read:\n\n[**Name: Markus Brown**]\n\n[**Class:** **Otherworlder (Earth) (Tier: Novice 45)**]\n\n[**Health: 1920/2110**]\n\n[**Mana: 7908/6890**]\n\n[**Strength: 140 (+30)**]\n\n[**Agility: 150 (+30)**]\n\n[**Arcana: 100**]\n\n[**Constitution: 240 (+30)**]\n\n[**Spirit: 160**]\n\n[**???: 0**]\n\nAnd Markus honestly felt about ready to leave. After giving Ember a thorough pat, he dumped another 30 in Strength, Spirit, and Agility each and then rose to his feet, mulling over the Frost Mastery choices he had as he began to make his way towards the edge of his cell.\n\nEmber tried to follow him out of his cell. He turned to her\n\n\u201cOff already without saying goodbye first?\u201d came a voice from the neighbouring cell.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet,\u201d Markus laughed, eyeing Cyrus as he walked to the bars to greet him. \u201cDo orcs typically sleep that long?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaesha made us run for days on end to keep up with her stride. My body isn\u2019t used to being still.\u201d Cyrus tutted. \u201cAnyways, I\u2019ll be praying for you out there. Go win so we can have that rematch, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor your sake, you\u2019d better hope I lose,\u201d Markus said, smirking at him. \u201cI\u2019m a lot stronger than I was when we last fought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Anyways, don\u2019t make jokes like that. I\u2019d never hope for something so terrible. Who would I wipe the floor with if you lost today?\u201d\n\nThe pair of them shared a laugh. It was weird that this was becoming Markus\u2019 new normal. Go out and fight something to the death, make plans for after if you were still breathing. It took the concept of \u2018each day as it comes\u2019 to a whole new level.\n\nLexi forwent the chains, choosing to simply guide Markus to the arena after he\u2019d grabbed his glaive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m meant to use your contract to bind you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna try and skip out or run off on me.\u201d She stopped and faced him. \u201cDon\u2019t, okay? I\u2019ll be in trouble otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Markus said, nodding at her. \u201cNo plans of bailing. I\u2019m gonna see this through no matter what.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just talking about this fight. But if anything, Markus wasn\u2019t entirely fearful for what came next. There was a part of him that felt scared, definitely, and fear of the unknown and of impending combat definitely got his blood pumping, but the prospect that he could see how far he\u2019d come outweighed that in some capacity. \n\nIt was strange to feel any kind of anticipation for something like this, but Markus couldn\u2019t deny the feeling either. It\u2019d been there each time he\u2019d narrowly survived a conflict, it\u2019d been there as he\u2019d taken charge and begun to train his body, and it was there now as he strode towards the arena, aware that these gods were still waiting and watching over him, eager to see the full extent of what he could do.\n\nMarkus already had a good idea of what kind of show he was planning to give them. He only hoped he had his assumptions about the coming fight correct.\n\nIf not, he was playing a dangerous game, but Markus trusted in his own hunches. He believed that even if there was much about this world and this setting he hadn\u2019t quite figured out, he at least knew what the purpose of these fights was, and furthermore, knew exactly what he needed to do if he wanted to maintain leverage in a situation like this.\n\nMarkus levelled his glaive as he walked, more points in Sharpness and some in Durability. He still had a fair few left over, and while he considered pushing further into the Affinity stat, he decided to hold off for now. Covering the basics was good enough for him at the moment. Having plenty of options ready and prepared for him to dip into was paramount to being able to adapt on the fly.\n\nAnd if there was one thing that\u2019d kept Markus alive so far, it was his ability to adapt to whatever bullshit this world threw at him.\n\nHe\u2019d continue trusting in that trait he exemplified. It could take him even further than it already had.\n\nEven bigger audience this time. He could hear them long before he even reached the tunnel out.\n\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d Lexi said once he reached the tunnel, teleporting away as soon as Markus stepped forwards.\n\nHe remembered how he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d first walked this path, armed with a weapon he\u2019d just learned the name of, confused and disoriented, cursing god for his fate and hoping to all fuck that he\u2019d manage to be able to get through the coming horrors and emerge out on the other side still breathing. He remembered that fear, that desperation.\n\nIn a way, he still felt it. He leant into it. It gave him strength.\n\nHunger was what would keep him alive in this place. Complacency bred death, and no matter how much Markus felt he might\u2019ve progressed, there was always the possibility that he was overestimating himself. He needed to not be careless if he could help it. If he wanted to do this right, to get his plan off without a hitch, then he needed the best balance of care and control he could possibly manage.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t only fighting for himself, after all. It didn\u2019t matter what Abrah had said, what anyone said. They didn\u2019t know his true aspiration, what mattered most to him.\n\nHe took in all the smiling, watching faces. More gods had turned out today than ever before, he was sure. The box seats were absolutely packed.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s cheers and jeers and shouts and boos, they all meshed together as Markus took centre stage, his image projected for all to witness.\n\nHe\u2019d seen himself up there before and been horrified by the implication, but what was to come. Now, he hardly recongised himself, but through all the dirt and grime and blood, he saw a solid, still jaw and a fiercely set pair of green eyes, ready and waiting, scouting the dark space from the opposite gate, eager to determine what his next target was.\n\nHe was a different person now than he\u2019d been only days ago, but he hadn\u2019t changed. Even through all of the screaming and adoration and hatred, even through the twenty times he\u2019d approached death, he was still the same person.\n\nA stubborn motherfucker hellbent on crushing this place and walking his way out of here, head held high, as this shitty institution burnt to the fucking ground.\n\nMarkus tuned out the announcer, tapping his foot against the sand.\n\n*Blah blah blah, get on with it.*\n\nHe watched as the gate finally moved. Felt the anticipation crawling along his spine. \n\nWhatever came out of that gate, whatever fresh challenge laid in wait, whatever ghastly horror they\u2019d thought to pit him against next?\n\nHe only felt sorry for it.\n\n//\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d410lk/harmless_human_sacrifice/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1dpxhxb/harmless_human_sacrifice_28/) | Next | [Next (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/silverdawnwrites) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/HMhUFzZwtc) \n\n**A/N: Hey!

So that\u2019s a shift in the plan.\u201d Shelly notes after listening to Philip\u2019s explanation and the man nods. She, Matha and Gweno were going over a large map of a large area with proposed battle planes. The likely routes the Vatras will take to besiege the baited base visible. It wasn\u2019t complicated so far, just an indication where Blythe\u2019s base, patrols and emplacements were and the shortest path from each Vatras base towards it. There was an assumption that each engagement would get a small amount of blood from each other, the emplacements would be disgustingly outnumbered, but the presence of all the Vatras forces in one area would give them pause. Which is when the barrage would begin. Each of the Vatras forces were highlighted as their prefered colours, bright red for Blythe, Yellow for Shuun, Blue for Millena and Green for Bramastra. Their own prospective forces were in pale purple and the landscape was glowing white to provide contrast to all of it.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately things didn\u2019t happen perfectly. Still, I have the Vatras in open war between Bramastra and Shuun, and both are pointed at Millena before I lure them to Blythe. With everyone eager to slaughter and looking the wrong way it should be a day at the firing range for you girls.\u201d Philip explains before pulling out a data chit out of his pocket. \u201cEspecially as I\u2019m going to be using this. Which is an upgrade to the worm program that I used to kill the communications while I stole The Overwhelming Order Station. It won\u2019t take them as long to crack it this time as it uses a lot of the same programming code as the first program. But it will be time to give off a salvo, perhaps two before repositioning. Then you can set a trap and launch another to bait the remaining forces of the enemy into an ambush.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201c... If they\u2019re packed in tightly enough we could take out nearly half of their forces in a single barrage.\u201d Shelly notes. \u201cThey\u2019ll scatter hard after that even without communications. But they\u2019ll struggle to find us if we don\u2019t use that second barrage. So no, one barrage then relocate to a trapped position filled with anti-air and anti-armour emplacements.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cVery good. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re thinking this through.\u201d Philip compliments. \u201cI will trust your advice on the competence of local forces.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the mission goal? Surely not total destruction...\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOf course not. Total Eradication is impractical, and to be frank insane, in almost any circumstance. In these ones we have to make the armies of the four Vatras unable or unwilling to resist us any longer. Either will do, but as wartime situations are fluid at best which one is easier to accomplish will vary from situation to situation.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cReally? Making someone unwilling to resist sounds easier.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cIt certainly sounds easier, but I find in practical experience that a properly trained opponent is only truly unwilling to resist when they fully understand they\u2019re unable to resist.\u201d Philip says and Shelly sighs.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYes that... that\u2019s not exactly inaccurate.\u201d She admits. It had taken her a very long time to stop resisting the Vatras and had taken a lot more punishment than she actually needed to. She hadn\u2019t really thought it through at the time, fighting was just natural.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nShe has to assume that the other soldiers are going to be like she was, except aimed at their Vatras instead of for the world itself.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cHmm... maybe it could be useful...\u201d Shelly considers as a strategy begins percolating in her mind. She taps a few commands and the white clusters\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that we might be able to buy ourselves some time if we spread out our forces. Make our barrage seem like it\u2019s actually coming from their own forces calling in close range artillery strikes.\u201d Shelly considers as she fiddles with the controls and the large purple cluster hidden behind a cluster of large rocky and tree covered hills breaks into four groups and each one signifies attacking a force opposite of itself and pointedly not attacking the nearest force. Following the other forces through the valleys that lead into the area surrounding the hill Blythe\u2019s base is built into.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cA bluff? With artillery? Dear goodness girl...\u201d Philip says in an admiring tone. He smiles widely at the suggestion. \u201cAn excellent idea. We will add to the confusion and while there will be some less total saturation, it will buy us more time to gather the forces together and make a single concentrated shot against one of the stations. We\u2019ll wait till after the stations have been hit by The Overwhelming Order, hit the next one and then scatter to a fortified location... here.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to convert a few aircars to be more or less mobile turrets. Automated preferably so we can just park them where they\u2019re needed to start filling the air with plasma and lasers to keep their armoured forces off our combat walkers.\u201d Shelly remarks. \u201cThey\u2019ll go low after that. The rocky terrain and trees will mean that they\u2019ll have slow down far away from their max speed or risk shattering against the ground. Which means ground forces with anti armour munitions will be in position to rip them apart. Provided we can find places they can more or less shoot their enemies in the back.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re planning on luring them all there at three tomorrow.\u201d Matha muses. \u201cThat means we\u2019ll have to get started damn early in the morning to be properly emplaced for all this madness. This is still bad odds, we\u2019ve reactivated as many of the old guard as we can, but we still have only two thirds the force of any one Vatras.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYes, but we not only have the pleasure of the first blow and choosing the battleground, but we will also have communication, a plan and our enemy is not unified. While we will not rely on it, we can cause disgusting amounts of damage to them and they\u2019re liable to blame each other instead of us. That tilts the odds into favouring us instead of them.\u201d Gweno adds in.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cSo, I take it things look good?\u201d Philip asks.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so smug. You promised us a guaranteed victory and us just taking control after everything was over. Instead we have to put work in.\u201d Shelly chides him.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201c... That was the plan, but no enemy in their right mind will follow a plan that includes their destruction. Unless you\u2019re fighting someone suicidal, but that\u2019s just going off on an odd tangent.\u201d Philip replies. \u201cNow, the focus is making sure we do this as quickly as possible. As bad as the Vatras are they\u2019re still more or less the better option to The Empire. So we need to end them quickly and then present as strong a force to The Empire to keep them off us.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cDo you know what The Empire is up to?\u201d Shelly asks.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI have some contacts. Secretaries of secretaries sort of routine. Assistant quartermasters and the men and women in logistics and the like can tell you what entire nations are doing if you understand how to read the data.\u201d Philip explains. \u201cAnd The Empire of Gavali is sensing weakness. They\u2019re moving scouting forces to this system to get a better look at things. Once the main battle is over I will have a shot for the station to take. One that is unlikely to hit as even a blind child can dodge at that range. But taking the shot will show The Empire that there\u2019s still teeth in the system making them cautious.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201c... So if we don\u2019t pull this off we go from bad to worse.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAnd if we do we go from bad to better and growing better still.\u201d Philip counters and he faces Shelly\u2019s glare with a smirk. \u201cSlow rot and inevitable doom, or a bit of a pinch as we cut it out and burn it away. Is it really a choice?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAre you comparing a civil war to a primitive medical procedure?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYes. I could make a compare to leaches as well if you\u2019d like?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cLeaches?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cA VERY primitive medical treatment.\u201d Philip remarks. \u201cNow then, we need to account for as much as possible on your end. Because this part of things needs to go off perfectly as it\u2019s equally a distraction to the simultaneous operation of Overwhelming Order rising from Lake Orthanaga to shoot down the other stations as the war we\u2019re waging in the heavens will be a distraction for this ground battle.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWe can hammer this out a little more. Coordination is going to be difficult.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cNot particularily. It all begins at three. I just need a few more things in place. Most importantly, a pair of allies.\u201d Philip says.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWhom?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cThe women who are going to be taking me in to Blythe. Or rather, I want the mother on our side. The daughter goes with her.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAnswer the question you slippery bastard.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cGrand Huntsmistress and Matriarch Yzma. She\u2019s on planet and paid me a little visit. Her daughter wants the bounty on my head, and I\u2019m willing to let them claim it, but under specific conditions.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAnd those conditions are?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\n\n  \n  \n\n\nPhilip waits patiently for Yzma\u2019s laughter to stop on the other side of the call. It was a good sign, if the woman was amused it meant she was more likely to agree.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHe puts the communicator on speaker and sets it to the side as he brings out a small novel. He needs to decompress a little before his next big day and as much fun as it would be to explore Yzma in every way imaginable, she would likely tire him out as much as he could tire her out. Either way it would be a poor idea.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nAfter he gets a few pages done Yzma calms down enough to ask if he\u2019s still there.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI am. And how are you madam? Have you recovered?\u201d He asks and there\u2019s a huff of amusement.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cSo you want me and my daughter to turn you in, and you\u2019ll come with us willingly and then your share of the bounty is payment for us to turn on our new employer the moment the money is ours and help you decapitate Blythe\u2019s organization and the woman herself before escaping with you because military bombardment is coming in.\u201d Yzma summarizes and Philip lets out a small chuckle.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the summation of it.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather think I have a rather even temperament.\u201d Philip replies smugly. \u201cBut if you\u2019re lacking in courage.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t try to bait me young man, you may be old and well vetted by human standards, but by mine you still need some seasoning.\u201d Yzma replies.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s no to a celebratory date?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201c... Yes, that\u2019s a no. Get another century of this under your belt and I\u2019ll come for you instead.\u201d Yzma promises him and he chuckles himself.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll see you soon enough either way.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t doubt it. After all, you\u2019re quite the father figure if your work with little Herbert was any indication.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cMom! Please stop!\u201d Giselle finally makes herself known in the conversation in the most amusing way possible.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cNow now dear, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me having another child the natural way. As much fun as sperm roulette is knowing that a Human girl or Dzedin boy is up next is more than a little...\u201d Yzma trails off as Giselle starts singing loudly in a language that Philip can only vaguely decipher.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAh children, a delight in almost every way.\u201d Philip says fondly.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOh I know! It\u2019s so cute to see her so uncomfortable when she thinks I don\u2019t know about the files labelled \u2018anatomical study\u2019.\u201d Yzma coos and the sound of Giselle outright choking in response brings a chuckle from Philip.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI see, still you\u2019re on board?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOh my goodness yes. It would take quite a bit for me to miss this kind of fun.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Giselle asks.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cNo, but you won\u2019t get any cut of the reward money, any kind of good story out of this and my disappointment.\u201d Yzma answers.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cDear goodness woman, play nice with her.\u201d Philip chides her.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s perfectly fair to cut her off from a share of the bounty if she doesn\u2019t want to take part.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI was talking about the disappointment, some have fought entire wars to avoid such a thing from a beloved parent.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cIt would be even more disappointing if my dear children dictated their lives based around my every opinion and not their own desires and aspirations.\u201d Yzma notes.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u2018Dear god woman, are you trying to force your children into a no win scenario?\u201d Philip asks.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called tough love. You need to know how to say no even to people you respect after all.\u201d Yzma says. \u201cAfter all, if the little skittering darlings are ever going to leave the nest they need to stand up to things scarier than mama out there.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201c... It would be quite the search for something in this galaxy that\u2019s more frightening than you are madam.\u201d Philip notes.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cRude.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re armour plated, with numerous sharp ends, a distinct lack of eyes, stabbing tail, night black appearance and sheer mobility and size makes you quite the force to be reckoned with, and that\u2019s before considering the sheer skill and experience you have.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cI already told you that you\u2019re too young for me.\u201d Yzma chides him.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cAnd you should know by now that I like challenges.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cIndeed, see you at three?\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cTwo, there\u2019s travel time to consider.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cOf course, silly me.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u201cYes silly you.

Especially if he could somehow manage to direct her rampage in the general direction of major enemy forces... What a romantic first date, Dancing on the bones of their enemies."
