GDPR has been mythologised quite a lot as some scary thing you can reference to achieve whatever end you want.

If there are other assets then theres no reason why this cant be done by simply subtracting the value of the outstanding loan from his share when the estate is paid out, e.g. if the estate is 100k and the outstanding loan is 18k then the total estate value is 118k, he will get 41k and your wife will get 59k.",

Best advice is to keep your keys away from the door so they can't be hooked through the letter box, but visible enough downstairs that if they do get in, they aren't motivated to come to your bedroom or get violent looking for the keys.

If your wife was going to allow unsupervised access then that is the the sort of thing that child social services look at all the time via safeguarding referrals. They would assess the situation holistically, probably including looking at if you have anger / control issues , not just her father in laws alleged offending. It would definitely be a good option if you are genuinely concerned your children are at risk of harm from this man now and in the future, or may themselves have been abused. It's not a suitable path to try and get justice or revenge against the fil though, or as a way of trying to make your wife break contact with her parents (rather than what must be done to safeguard your kids from harm).",

While youve reacted to discovering a child abuser in your immediate family the way a lot of us would (with anger and disgust and a desire to protect all the children in the family), its not uncommon for some people to try to sweep it under the carpet or to protect the abuser above the victims or potential victims. The sad reality is that a lot of people think like your mother in law does when it comes to child sexual abuse- they try to rationalise it as a mistake or something driven by stress etc.\n\nWhile you cant force your wife to report what happened to the police, and nor should you try, you should insist that she seeks out specialist counselling for survivors of childhood abuse and, when youve calmed down and dont feel as shocked and angry as you do now, discuss with her the boundaries around your child and contact with the in-laws going forward. You can also contact childline to discuss what your options are going forward with protection of other children in the wider family. Theyll be able to advise you on what steps to take next"
