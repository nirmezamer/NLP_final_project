            "The Ramblers Association suggests there's no issue unless it's a banned breed or a guard dog.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking-hub/rules-around-keeping-animals-fields-paths\n\n\nHowever, I would consider that there are a couple of risks\u00a0\n\n\n- your dog jumps, pushes someone over and they're injured. They make a personal injury claim against you. I would suggest ensuring you have pet insurance that covers third party liability - or, at a minimum, Dogs Trust membership which includes third party liability cover (but not health cover) at \u00a325 per year.\u00a0\n\n\n- someone brings their reactive dog along the footpath on lead, your dog is over friendly and gets bitten, and there's a hefty vets bill.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may wish to post a sign at the entrance to your property - something tongue in cheek - \"Please note this public footpath passes through our private garden. Golden retriever welcoming committee on duty, the committee welcomes butt scratches, new dog friends and cuddles. Their mum asks that you don't feed them, even if they beg\".\u00a0\n\n\nThis will give reactive dog owners and dog haters fair warning, and everyone else a bit of a smile.\u00a0",
            "A similar example would be a public footpath running through a working farm, surely? Sheepdogs are always out on patrol and no one would dream of telling the farmer to keep them on a lead. So as long as you're willing to accept some risk to your dog from a reactive dog (which may or may not be on a lead anyway) then I'd say you're clear.\u00a0\n\n\nA notice that includes the breed would be helpful to walkers who may be nervous around dogs. A Goldie is a very different proposition to some breeds.\u00a0",
            "Interested to see what the legal answer is here. \n\nAs an aside, it would be worth you putting a sign on the path entries saying \u201coff lead dog in this garden\u201d or some such. \n\nAt least then people are warned and have the chance to make their own choice about entering. I know a lot of dogs who would react badly to a \u2018friendly\u2019 dog approaching when they are on lead. If nothing else, it could result in your dog sustaining an injury, which it\u2019s better to prevent if you can. \n\nThen there\u2019s a lot of people who are terrified by dogs, and again a \u2018friendly\u2019 large dog greeting them might backfire if they feel like they have to protect themselves.\n\nGiving people advance warning seems fair, just as farmers do with cows in a field.",
            "Yes, you can have the dog off the lead *but* as with it being off the lead anywhere else, you're responsible for ensuring that it's not out of control or causing any sort of danger to others.",
            "Unless your dog could be described as dangerously out of control or is physically causing harm to someone or their property, then no, there is nothing against having your dog off lead in your own garden.",
            "Can you fence the footpath off?",
            "Legally there is never a requirement for dogs to be on the lead in the UK unless they are a banned breed or in on private land that requires it.\n\nPractically, this is a risk to your dog, if someone passes through with an aggressive or reactive dog and yours bounds up to say hello then he could be injured.  If a human who hates dogs passes through they might decide to kick him away or throw something at him.  Its rare, but it can happen.  Also your garden doesn't sound secure if there is public access to it so your dog could wander off into danger or be led away/tempted away by someone's picnic passing through/stolen more easily.\n\nYou might want to look at fencing in the right of way so that your dog can be off lead in your garden without any risk to him.",
            "You can apply to divert/alter/etc the right of way:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-rights-of-way-landowner-responsibilities#creating-closing-upgrading-downgrading-or-re-routing-public-rights-of-way \n\nYou could then make a sign saying, \"This is the way\".\nGood luck.",
            "Yes you can let your dog off her lead.  Standard laws on dangerous and out of control dogs apply.  However, not everyone on the footpath might appreciate a dog running up to them even if you know its friendly. \n\nIf its not too long a path, you could fence, hedge, garden feature it in - ensuring the minimum widths are maintained - 1.5m for footpaths, 3m for bridleways. Thus allowing your pupper unencumbered free rein of the section separated off from the path.\n\nIf you have the time, and energy as it takes a lot going through all the legal processes, would it be possible to route the footpath around the edge and then fence it, keeping as much space for your pupper as possible? You would need to apply for permission (highways agency, local council, LDNPA, etc) to change the route, and have reasons for moving it (more than \"spoils the view\", \"disrupts the ambience of the garden\") and shouldn't greatly increase the distance."

            "Contact the council\u2019s private renting team immediately.",
            "NAL\n\nHave you spoken to environmental health department at the council? \n\nHave you spoken to the energy supplier about the electric been cut off?",
            "NAL\n\nAre you a property owner or a tenant?\n\nIf you're a tenant, then your landlord should be providing you with alternative accommodation until this problem is resolved.\n\nIf this landlord also owns the other property and all of the other flats in the building, then they really need to look at relocating this panel or st bare minimum making sure it's in a locked cupboard.\n\nProperty owner a little more tricky, your home insurance may be able to assist to cover any costs you may have.\n\nBut the best bet is the private rental team at the local council, who should come and mediate the problem.",
            "(NAL) Turning off electricity affects everyone's safety as it cuts off power to fire alarms. I'm sure landlord can force their way to the flat and turn the electricity on for health and safety reasons.\n\nAlso, electricity meter does not belong to the tenant, and electricity company sure has a right to access it when needed.",
            "One thing that might get the landlord responding is to say that with no electricity for over 5 days now the property isn't inhabitable. You'll be getting a hotel room in the meantime and charging the daily costs to them, plus all out of pocket expenses incurred.",
            "This might fall under The Protection from Harassment Act 1997.\n1.A: a person must not pursue a course of conduct \u2014\n(a)which involves harassment of two or more persons, and\n(b)which he knows or ought to know involves harassment of those persons, and\n(c)by which he intends to persuade any person (whether or not one of those mentioned above)\u2014\n(i)not to do something that he is entitled or required to do\n\n8.A: \n(1)Every individual has a right to be free from harassment and, accordingly, a person must not engage in conduct which amounts to harassment of another and\u2014\n(a)is intended to amount to harassment of that person; or\n(b)occurs in circumstances where it would appear to a reasonable person that it would amount to harassment of that person.\n\"Harassment of a person includes causing alarm or distress\".\n\nThis law generally applies to stalking and threats, but you might be able to use it here. The police are pretty rubbish with this one, though. When I had to use it in 1998, none of the coppers at my local station knew it existed!\n\nGood luck.",
            "Call and ask for the fire brigade. Tell them you need help breaking down a barricaded door that is blocking access to your breaker and you have no fire alarm. \nIf there is a chance the former tenant might be inside don't go in alone.",
            "Is the main RCD board in that flat? If they have simplify turned the RCD board off there's nothing you can do. If they have actively tampered with the fuse seal then this is illegal and the electricity supplier have a duty to repair this. \n\nThe landlord is an idiot for allowing an RCD board to positioned like this. It all seems mad to me. \n\nIf the landlord is legally blocked from access to the flat there is nothing you or he can do in the short term.\n\nYou should contact the tenant who has done this and have all of your co tenants deliver multiple separate letters before action implying that you have mounting costs as a result of the electricity being cut off. \n\nReally the tenant thinks they're hurting the landlord but they really aren't.",
