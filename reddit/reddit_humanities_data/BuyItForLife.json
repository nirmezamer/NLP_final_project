Are you storing it somewhere that's exposed to heat regularly?\n\n> is there any way to refresh this housing, using chemicals or heat?\n\nRetro computer enthusiasts have a process they call \"Retrobrite\" where you cover the plastic in hydrogen peroxide and expose it to UV light, either from the sun or from a blacklight\n\n> why does the mixer merit a finish that\u2019s so much more durable?\n\nThey do different jobs, so they're made of different materials that have to be finished in different ways",
