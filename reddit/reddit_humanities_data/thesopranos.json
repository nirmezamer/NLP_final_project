I suspect the only real parts were fucking off on the handyman job, and killing that diligent woodsman concerned with car crash fault.\n\nThis rest was an ethereal fantasy sequence.  Romance, intense feelings, high drama, love-making at a picnic...\n\nRemember when Gene Pontecorvo said: \"Must be like kissing a fiyaman.\"\n\nJust one of those things which stuck in his subconscious.\n\nA motorcycle driving fireman who rescues kids from burning buildings.  How many fires are in one small town??  And a whole crew of fireman finochs?   And then everyone clapped. Madon!\n\nI think his fantasy took over when he was reading the fitness magazine in bed.",

And not only that, the hottest one there, a grizzled, muscular firefighter nonetheless, is SUPER attracted to his jiggly, overweight self? I don't buy that shit for one second.",

I used to just think of him as some stupid, bratty, entitled kid for the most part, but on rewatch its kinda interesting to see how AJ is not only the polar opposite of Tony but also how he evolves (and devolves) into an exaggerated reflection of Tonys own failures as a person. Robert Iler absolutely *nailed* the character."
