            "It's kinda funny to see some of the reaction to Prime 4.\n\n\nHalf the people are saying that looks too good to be running on Switch, it's Switch 2 footage and 100% will be cross gen. While the other half are saying that looks exactly like Prime Remastered.\n\n\nMeanwhile, if you go to places like r/gaming (ew) people are saying that looks dated and nothing special or different from the trilogy. The classic gamers obessed with realistic graphics and games that play play the same.",
            "After today's Direct I don't see Switch 2 being officially revealed until Jan/Feb. Unless they retread Switch in which case a soft reveal in Oct/Nov and big showcase in Jan.",
            "I think it will have a Mario game.\u00a0",
            "I\u2019m really hoping for a March release. Nintendo didn\u2019t show any solid release dates after DKCR in January.\n\nIf they wait until November we\u2019ll have to limp through another year with an 8 year old console. If it releases in spring and they have supply issues around launch, those hopefully should be resolved before the peak shopping season in November-December.",
            "The new nintendo console will probably and should be called the switch 2 but it would be cool if it was called the \n\nsuper switch because that would  full circle",
            "Nintendo will try to replicate the switch 1 launch year, so I'm keeping that in mind. They want a new game every month to keep switch 2 in the public consciousness. They don't need to be big games, though. Smaller games, remakes, and new/unpopular IP can be used to fill the gap between big releases. \n\nSo this is what I'm most comfortable in predicting for the switch 2 first year:\n\nThe Switch 2 will be released in spring 2025 with Metroid Prime 4 as a luch tittle. a 3D Mario game and / or Mario Kart by the time holiday shopping starts. A monolithsoft game that shows off the power of the switch 2. Pok\u00e9mon Z-A during Summer and Gen 5 Remakes during Winter, Both will be cross gen titles. No new Kirby or Fire emblem game this direct leads me to believe that they are getting something during year 1. Yearly zelda release will be a remaster or a warriors game.\n\nThese are the predictions I'm less sure of. These are shot in the dark guesses.\n\nYear 1 Animal crossing game, reusing assests from New Horizons. Another Ubisoft collaboration like Mario + Rabbits. Camelot has been MIA since 2021's Mario Golf. My hunch says they are either the devs of brothership or they are working on a Goldensun remake. Teaser for the next big 3D Zelda during the 2025 fall direct, but will not be released until 2027 at the earliest. Next Level Game's Luigi's mansion 4 will be announced, though im not sure if it will be a 2025 or 2026 release. Arms 2 is a possibility, It sold pretty well for a new fighting game IP, all things considered. Remake/revival of a dormant IP, Chibi robo, Codename S.T.E.A.M, Dragalia Lost, or Ever oasis are all possible. One of those Indie games published and co-developed by Nintendo like Good Job and Sniperclips.",
            "Just throwing it out there so I can claim I was right when it happens, TES Oblivion remaster will be a Switch 2 launch title.",
            "So I have a New 3ds XL console and a while back it got water inside the system and now it\u2019s constantly pressing down. I gave up hope on fixing it since the incident happened a while ago. On the Nintendo repair website it says they haven\u2019t quit repairs for New 3DS XL, but I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this system and knows if they will actually get me back a fixed one. The billing says it\u2019s around $80 for the repair so I would hope so.",
            "Nintendo's biggest mistake with the Nintendo Switch launch was only having ONE (1) AAA launch title. I still think about how the Switch's reputation would have been completely dead on arrival if Breath of the Wild wasn't the complete revolutionary masterpiece that it was. I have a feeling we'll see at least THREE big games upon launch, specifically\n\nNEXT MAINLINE MARIO/MARIO KART GAME\n\u2022 Captures a general, wide audience\n\u2022 Odyssey team has HAD to be cooking up something between now and 2017\n\u2022 Will be announced with a full reveal trailer at the Nintendo Switch successor's presentation\n\nPOK\u00c9MON LEGENDS: Z-A\n\u2022 Captures a younger audience\n\u2022 After the crashing thud of Scarlet and Violet, I imagine Nintendo/Game Freak is rushing to salvage the Pok\u00e9mon franchise's reputation as soon as possible with a shiny new game with shiny new visuals on a shiny new console\n\u2022 Will be announced with a full reveal trailer at the Nintendo Switch successor's presentation\n\nMETROID PRIME 4: BEYOND\n\u2022 Captures a more mature, core gaming audience\n\u2022 Based on the June Direct trailer... the game looks mostly done. So why wasn't there an EXACT release date even though the game pretty much looks good to release? Because having an exact release date for a 2025 AAA, first-party title would potentially reveal the Switch successor's release date, as Nintendo intends for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond to be a launch title for the new system.\n\nThese three titles are my best guesses. Again, my main reasoning for assuming there will be multiple launch titles is because I highly doubt Nintendo wants to take such a gigantic risk again by releasing a new system with only one new first-party title available. I really don't think Nintendo is willing to be as confident as they were with BotW with anything else, which is why I think they're going to cast a wide net and try to capture every segment of their market with games specially targeted toward each segment.",
            "High chance that there will be a full 3D \"GOTY-style\" Zelda within 12 months of launch.\n\nSeveral reasons.\n\n- Inside sources suggest that TOTK was complete for well over a year, and only had polish time between then and launch.  As they had committed to no DLC, this means that the team would have immediately started another project  somewhere between end of 2021 / beginning 2022.\n\n- While Echoes of Wisdom looks amazing, it's obvious that it's reusing not only assets from Link's Awakening, but maps from Link to the Past.  Combine that with the fact that a 2D Zelda takes altogether less work than a 3D Zelda, and it's almost certain that Grezzo is making it, it seems obvious that this was not the project that most of the Zelda team was working on.\n\n- Monolith Soft's last game, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, launched two full years ago.  No word yet on what their next project is.  Monolith was instrumental in helping the Zelda team design the world of Breath of the Wild.\n\n- Zelda is an incredible start for any console.  Mario may get the masses, but Zelda attracts the core gaming audience, and it's the core gaming audience that are willing to be early adopters of tech.  The two systems in which Zelda was a launch title - the Wii and the Switch - both had phenomenal starts and broke sales records with their launch title.  And Nintendo knows this."

Previously kept getting to round 29 and losing.\u00a0\n\nHad some nice/lucky bonuses, though. Tier 3 Buddy and Toxic upgrade to dash attack as SoR 3 Skate.

Absolutely love the final game that we got, but would also like to see an alternate version with the initial concepts.\u00a0\n\nLiterally the only thing I don\u2019t like about the game is that they made modern artwork for Roo and yet only the SoR3 version is playable"

        "content": "I was reflecting on my history of gaming, which mostly was shaped by Nintendo starting in the 90s. Although I've played Sony and Microsoft systems including PC, I would say I have the most experience with Nintendo. I only owned an SNES and a GameBoy Color then, while I played other systems at others houses. As the decades went by I found myself owning the GBA, DS, and 3DS, but no consoles. My parents actually bought the Wii in the late 2000s (for Tiger Woods PGA golf) which introduced me to a new (to me) Nintendo home console. I will forever love Mario Galaxy and ZoL Twilight Princess because of this. And as for the Switch I am more invested than I have ever been for any other console or handheld. I probably have purchased over 30/40 different games for this console which is way more than I had ever purchased for any other console, including PC. As I reflected on this though, I'd likely identify more as a handheld gamer, but because of the switch I've been brought more into the traditional console fold. So it made me wonder how many of you are out there which swung more in one direction than the other (i.e. handheld or console) but was introduced to a new gaming style like myself?",

Partly because that was when I was going to school/university, but also the 3DS had a much stronger library than the Wii U. So 3DS was my primary device.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore that I was probably more of a console person. Now I'm a little more console than handheld.\u00a0"
