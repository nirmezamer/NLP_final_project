All threads about this topic will be removed and redirected to this thread.\n\nPlease note that **nothing is verified** about the next Nintendo console except for the fact that it will be announced during this fiscal year. All information about its specs, name, etc. are just speculation and/or wishful thinking.\n\nThank you.",

            "After today's Direct I don't see Switch 2 being officially revealed until Jan/Feb. Unless they retread Switch in which case a soft reveal in Oct/Nov and big showcase in Jan.",
            "I think it will have a Mario game.",
            "Im really hoping for a March release. Nintendo didnt show any solid release dates after DKCR in January.\n\nIf they wait until November well have to limp through another year with an 8 year old console. If it releases in spring and they have supply issues around launch, those hopefully should be resolved before the peak shopping season in November-December.",
            "The new nintendo console will probably and should be called the switch 2 but it would be cool if it was called the \n\nsuper switch because that would  full circle",
            "Just throwing it out there so I can claim I was right when it happens, TES Oblivion remaster will be a Switch 2 launch title.",
            "So I have a New 3ds XL console and a while back it got water inside the system and now its constantly pressing down. I gave up hope on fixing it since the incident happened a while ago. On the Nintendo repair website it says they havent quit repairs for New 3DS XL, but I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this system and knows if they will actually get me back a fixed one. The billing says its around $80 for the repair so I would hope so.",
            "Do you expect the internal storage to be 64GB or 256GB? Do you expect it to be flash memory or SSD? Expect games to still run from game card?",
            "I just want a thick(it helps with ergo and you can feel it with battery, vibration motors and a fan)psp sized, backwards compatible switch 2 micro. It's literally my most wanted console that's actaully possible and I'd gladly wait til the very end of the switch 2 lifecycle(while playing with a probably launch switch 2 or switch 2 lite) so they can maximize gains in efficiency. I just want a maximum portability console that can play my awesome switch library alongside my eventaul awesome switch 2 library without struggling to carry it without a bag and without bulging about to rip pockets",
            "Hope it allows for memory extension via an M2 drive or an external ssd / hdd attached to the dock (Assuming there is a dock.). Micros SD storage growth has hit a wall it seems and its really annoying to be stuck having to delete games.\n\nAlso hope they dont focus too hard on the portable side and forget the console side. Give us a console dedicated version like the portable dedicated lite, or at the very least a beefy dock with extra fans, lots of USB ports and upscaling / extended graphics.",
            "it will either be a headset or have a headset attachment."

            "I finally made it past Level 30 in the Streets of Rage 4 endless survival mode dlc! Just popped the cart in the switch on a whim and played for a couple days before finally breaching 30. Previously kept getting to round 29 and losing.\n\nHad some nice/lucky bonuses, though. Tier 3 Buddy and Toxic upgrade to dash attack as SoR 3 Skate. His alternate dash rolls on the ground, so no jump interruptions. Just roll and roll and wipe out all the enemies.",
            "Games I'm excited for: Mario and Luigi brothership has been my dream for years and I am so happy it was announced. I will definitely proceed to buy it. \nGames I've been playing: I've recently been playing the world ends with you on the ds and I just absolutely love both the visual style and the music",
            "a day late, but M&L is back on switch! im looking forward to Brothership after Partners in Time.",
            "That was one of the best directs I've ever seen in the switch era.",
            "Ahh man the other day I got beaten on level 30 ffs.. what rewards did you get?",
            "You unlock the final round of new weapons and artwork when you beat level 30. Some of the artwork is pretty cool. Absolutely love the final game that we got, but would also like to see an alternate version with the initial concepts.\n\nLiterally the only thing I dont like about the game is that they made modern artwork for Roo and yet only the SoR3 version is playable"

        "content": "I was reflecting on my history of gaming, which mostly was shaped by Nintendo starting in the 90s. Although I've played Sony and Microsoft systems including PC, I would say I have the most experience with Nintendo. I only owned an SNES and a GameBoy Color then, while I played other systems at others houses. As the decades went by I found myself owning the GBA, DS, and 3DS, but no consoles. My parents actually bought the Wii in the late 2000s (for Tiger Woods PGA golf) which introduced me to a new (to me) Nintendo home console. I will forever love Mario Galaxy and ZoL Twilight Princess because of this. And as for the Switch I am more invested than I have ever been for any other console or handheld. I probably have purchased over 30/40 different games for this console which is way more than I had ever purchased for any other console, including PC. As I reflected on this though, I'd likely identify more as a handheld gamer, but because of the switch I've been brought more into the traditional console fold. So it made me wonder how many of you are out there which swung more in one direction than the other (i.e. handheld or console) but was introduced to a new gaming style like myself?",

            "Its always been both. My psp and sp probably got just as much playtime as my home consoles did",
            "I definitely spent more time on my handhelds - Gameboy, GBASP (bless) then DS Lite. I didn't play my 2DS much beyond Pokmon and Animal Crossing. Overall though my Pokmon playtime alone could put my handheld above console use.",
