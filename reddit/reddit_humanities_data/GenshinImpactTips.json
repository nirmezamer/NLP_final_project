            "F2P furina\n\nHi, I\u2019m COMPLETELY new to genshin impact and I\u2019m currently ar 33. I had recently posted a question about my alhaitham, and the replies I got was about getting furina. I did my research on her but just got more questions instead. Like what I should build on her, health? Or like CRIT? Help and give ur opinion\ud83d\ude4f",
            "i don\u2019t have a healer and i thought charlotte would be in furina\u2019s banner. should i skip furina because i don\u2019t have a decent healer? \n\ni have yaoyao but i find her clunky because she needs on field time to heal",
            "I wanted to do a hyperbloom team with nahida furina raiden and kokomi but i dont have kokomi yet, i read that sigewinne was going to be a healer, would i pull for her instead for kokomi?",
            "I put my C0 Raiden (65/145 with the Catch), Xiangling, Bennett, C4 Chevreuse team on the first half of chamber 1, but I can only muster 8:20-8:35 left. I try to do all the right things like making sure my burst hits every enemy, guiding one wave towards the next one's spawn, defeating the Eremite summons early, triggering all the buffs, etc. Is it possible for someone with average mechanics and decent rotations to shave the time even further, or am I just screwed because I don't have enough damage?",
            "I have a team consisting of jean,beidou and Barbara I am planning to replace Barbara with furina and I'm looking to add a pyro character to the team I have Bennett, xianling,dehya,thoma and amber who should I choose?",
            "What are the Best artifacts for jean as a main DPS",
            "Do you guys think that pulling on the weapon banner will be a good idea for me?\nSome context: I ended up accidentally pulling Clorinde and i fell in love with her and i really want a five star weapon for her. I also have Ayaka who i don\u2019t really play that much anymore and i know both swords are rather bad on her.  I have the black sword r1 which i\u2019m currently using. If i lose to Lofi i don\u2019t think it will be that bad since i plan to use her with Nahida and that will give her plenty of em. I know that pulling a misspliter is gonna be better for both characters and a more versatile option but i don\u2019t really want to wait that long and what is its paired with a weapon i don\u2019t need or can use.\nI have been pulling on the weapon banner with the hope i will get an early five star but that hasn\u2019t happened and i\u2019m at 40 pity and not guaranteed . I don\u2019t plan to pull on the next few weapon banners as i either don\u2019t like the weapon or don\u2019t have the character. So should i spend the few dollars to get a five star or is it not worth it for my account? Btw money is not really a problem i\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s gonna be worth it upgrade.",
            "Okay, so I just started playing Genshin and I'm really trying to build an account that is good and I don't want to be wasting resources on things I shouldn't be upgrading. Basically, I just want to make the lowest amount of mistakes I can. I want to know when I should be upgrading characters so I can build good teams, and I'm not upgrading characters that I will never use. What artifacts I should upgrade, so I don't just waste upgrade materials, or if it doesn't matter because the resources will eventually be put into new artifacts, like I can use old upgraded artifacts to get exp on new ones (idk if that's how it works or not.) Should I be upgrading 3 star weapons/artifacts at all, or just leave them at lvl 1 and wait until I get 4 star weapons/artifacts and upgrade those? I will elaborate on anything and answer any questions/provide pictures if needed. Any help is greatly appreciated. :) Sorry I don't know much about the game yet, so sorry if anything doesn't really make since."

        "content": "I just read the Sigewinne's kit and wonder why her last bubble bounce heals so much (50% of her max HP) to her team except her. I've seen people run her with Furina, Yelan and Kazuha for abyss too.\n\nI think her 50% of her max HP healing seems to make Furina's Fanfare stack as much as possible with the right rotation and timing (use Furina's burst right before the last bubble bounce). Assuming that Sigewinne have 40k HP, her last bounce heals at least 20k HP for each party member so 20K x 3 = 60k HP healing is quite high.\n\nA Fanfare stack is granted to Furina for each %HP of party members' HP increase or decrease. So if Kazuha has 20k HP, Yelan has 30k HP and Furina has 40k HP, so Kazuha will at least grant 100 Fanfare stacks, Yelan gives 67 stack and Furina gives 50 stack, so about 217 stack can be gained right at the start of Furina's burst with the right timing.\n\nI might be overthinking or tripping too much. I didn't plan to pull for her, but I just wondering if her kit is just too niche which is to gain Fanfare stack as much as possible. My calculation might be wrong, so correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n  \nEdit: I'm dumb. I just read some comments and reread the skill description. Looks like Mihoyo really butchered Sigewinne lol.",

            "It's because her own kit has a BoL mechanic. Having BoL buffs healing rate. Skill drops source water droplets, burst collects them, or just walking.\n\nClearing BoL restores energy, having BoL increases outgoing healing. So she needs BoL until she uses burst and until her E ends. Hence, her own heals come at the end of E. Otherwise BoL mechanics would get messed up.",

            "For 5 star, Jean, Kokomi & Baizhu are good healers. For 4 star, Yao Yao, Kuki Shinobu, Barbara are still good choice. Since you are new player, Barbara is good enough for early game.",
