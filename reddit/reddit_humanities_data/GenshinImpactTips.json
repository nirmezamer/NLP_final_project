            "Builds: https://enka.network/u/887136268/\n\nAre these builds okay? Which character should I prioritize and improve? Is it possible to do floor 12 with these team comps?\n\nI also have:\nLv.90 C0 Kuki Shinobu (1006 EM, 2 EM + 2 EM set)\nLv.90 C2 Xingqiu (260.3% ER, 1453 ATK, 52.4%/119.2% CR/CDMG, R3 Sacrificial Sword, EoSF Set)\nBoth their talents are 1/9/9\n\nThey're not on the showcase because it can fit only 8 (will register enka acc and verify my account next day). I also recently pulled Alhaitham and is still building him\n\nThank you very much btw \ud83d\ude4f",

            "Pre-farming for Nilou. I want to make an F2P team: Nilou, Barbara, Dendro MC, Collei. However, I've heard that maximizing someone's bloom damage (especially if they are a catalyst enabler like Barbara) would be more efficient. If I make Barbara my enabler, my team would no longer be the one I mentioned above, but instead: Nilou, Barbara, Dendro MC, Yaoyao (because my healer would now have to be Yaoyao).\n\nHowever, the question I have is, would Nilou steal my Barbara blooms since they are both hydro? I don't own Nilou, so I don't know how this works, but wouldn't I have to activate my elemental skill for the bountiful core passive which would then give me that hydro aura that would steal blooms if it were to come into contact with dendro?\n\nI might be wrong about which team is stronger, so if possible, let me know which of the two below would be the best as a F2P:\n\nTeam 1: Nilou, Barbara, Dendro MC, Collei\n\nTeam 2: Nilou, Barbara (Bloom Enabler), Dendro MC, Yaoyao",

Only lost one 50/50 for Mona.\n\nGot Lost Prayer for Mona which is great for exploration with Clorinde so I\u2019m leveling pretty quickly.\n\nThose are my only two 5 stars though, and I\u2019m using Fischer with Chev.\n\nI\u2019m going to be pulling for Furina and trying to make a decent team with Clorinde temporarily and may change builds later, but I know she is worth it.\n\n Can I use LoFI on Furina, or is it actually just a stupid stat stick that is very niche? I\u2019m trying to navigate builds and stats but I\u2019m a little confused being so new.\n\nAny advice would help, thank you, I feel stupid for tossing my only R2 5 star in storage and I\u2019m really hoping it would have a decent usage with Furina.",

I'm currently using Raiden Hyperbloom (Raiden, Nahida, XQ and Diona) team but need a strong second team.\n\nI have been saving for Furina as I believe she will be a significant improvement to my roster but I'm looking for advice as to what to wish for with all my wishes saved up.

        "content": "I just read the Sigewinne's kit and wonder why her last bubble bounce heals so much (50% of her max HP) to her team except her. I've seen people run her with Furina, Yelan and Kazuha for abyss too.\n\nI think her 50% of her max HP healing seems to make Furina's Fanfare stack as much as possible with the right rotation and timing (use Furina's burst right before the last bubble bounce). Assuming that Sigewinne have 40k HP, her last bounce heals at least 20k HP for each party member so 20K x 3 = 60k HP healing is quite high.\n\nA Fanfare stack is granted to Furina for each %HP of party members' HP increase or decrease. So if Kazuha has 20k HP, Yelan has 30k HP and Furina has 40k HP, so Kazuha will at least grant 100 Fanfare stacks, Yelan gives 67 stack and Furina gives 50 stack, so about 217 stack can be gained right at the start of Furina's burst with the right timing.\n\nI might be overthinking or tripping too much. I didn't plan to pull for her, but I just wondering if her kit is just too niche which is to gain Fanfare stack as much as possible. My calculation might be wrong, so correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n  \nEdit: I'm dumb. I just read some comments and reread the skill description. Looks like Mihoyo really butchered Sigewinne lol.",
