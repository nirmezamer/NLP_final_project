            "Hello everyone, I am looking for a buddy or two to visit Lindisfarne on September 8th. We would need to share the car rental expenses (which are manageable), as the 477 bus does not run on Sundays. I am 30F and would like to travel with other women or a mixed group (one M + one F is fine).",

Must have fucked up the landcode or something. \n\nIs there any online search on UK Numbers?

            "Awesome, what part of the city did you see?",
            "I'm at 5 months and it's fairly simple\n\nThe reason it seems to take forever is they often write  to the companies and that adds delay - everything is electronic but solicitors haven't moved with the times. 20+ years ago I was involved in setting up eDocumenting systems, yet solicitors don't have this or a secure upload portal!",
            "Went to attend a wedding, but the main touristy things we managed to do were the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and walking and eating around the surrounding streets.  It was lovely, but very hot lol\n\nAlso snuck a day to Disneyland lol, I had never been but always wanted to when I was a kid",
            "Sounds great. There\u2019s so many interesting things to see and do in Paris. What I love is how neighbourhoods in walking distance can be so different.\n\nHow was Disneyland?",
            "Still no further forward on Mum's estate\n\nAnyone one else would be getting a written warning over this but solicitors seem to be immune from this\n\nStressed out\n\nBuilding work practically complete, just a gate to build/fix\n\nSolar in and working! Now using no grid power",
            "Wilson and Fish took more than 14 months to settle my Mum's estate because they submitted forms with my name spelled incorrectly and had the initial filing rejected for her pension AFAIK.  Only thing I can do is wish you the best of luck, because I hit a brick wall trying to phone and chase it up myself.\n\nI'm still waiting on copies of paperwork bring sent r.e the mortgage being paid off even though she had insurance to pay the balance off in the event of her passing. I can't fathom why it takes so long at all, but I'm ignorant to the process. \n\nHaven't seen a single negative complaint against them so I'm not sure if I'm just being anxious and in a rush to close this chapter out. \n\nBest of luck mate."
