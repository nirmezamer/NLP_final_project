            "Notice how he barely moves his left leg? There is a metal skeleton brace system inside his clothes. It has a gimbal on it so it can rotate like that. It is attached to a metal anchor in his arm, that he locks into that hose which also has a metal brace inside of it.",

And you can see him attach the bar in his arm to the pipe instead. It's cool at first but really after he holds it tight your like. Well... why the fu*k have it then.",
            "Look how as he got up onto the bar, he barely moved his left arm. There's a brace inside the sleeve and inside the thick clothing. Likely to also have small locking mechanics by doing different movements to allow him to move around and stay put.",
