            "This trick is called Double Cross by Mark Southworth. The performance method he is using is not my favorite.\nThe trick is performed like this, >! Notice the black end piece on the sharpie? That is a removable stamp, which in this case is a cross. Also on the end is a little sticky putty which allows him to stick it to his finger. During the introduction of the trick he stamps the hand, for example, \u201cput your hands out, a little further apart(while moving the hands.\u201d Next the ink from the sharpie is designed to dissolve with moisture. Typically spit or condensation from a glass which you can get on a finger through the performance. This is a phenomenal trick and worth the purchase.!<",
