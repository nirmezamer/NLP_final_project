            "PLEASE HELP \n\nI made the mistake of following too many people at once because I had no idea that was a restriction on Instagram for this. So my account got suspended twice. Both times I have successfully appealed because I wasn't breaking their rules I was just using the website too much. So I downloaded the app afterwards since I was told it was better to use the app. Then for some reason, I can access my account now, but I can't follow or like anyone's posts. I also checked in my instagram account to see for any restrictions and it said none, but as soon as I try to like or follow it says I'm restricted until the 24th of June. I am running a campaign account so I have to be active on it! Please help!! Do I just wait it out or what do I do? I am so afraid it puts another ban on me right after because that is what happened when I stopped being on instagram for a while and then it just banned me again.",

I just don't get it, I've logged to my IG account using email (B) and the same password. Is this normal??? In the account information there's only email (A) which is connected to my IG but i can still use both emails to login what is this??",
            "I went into instagram and inside the app i had a notification for a dm, when I clicked the notification it led me to the message chain but the message itself was deleted by the sender. I was able to read a snippet of the message in the notification window, is there a way for me to see/recover this message/notification?",
            "Hello! I run an instagram for my FT and of course I must not have written down the new password. I've lost track of how many times I have hit the password reset link and nothing is coming to my email. Any help?",
            "I tried creating an instagram account. i added username, phone number and password, followed the step and reached the confirmation phase. i  entered the instagram code immediatly after receiving it and it told me it was outdated, i asqued for annother code and did not receive it, waited 10 minutes and asked again, still not recieved it. i then tried creating a account with my phone and it told me it was already used for an existing account,, and i recieved a text with an istagram code and an username that wasnt mine and after looking up it is an account with 10 picture dozens of followers and over a thousand follows. looking right now my account actually exist as created and i am just confused as to why i received someone else username. do anyone ever had the same problem or an answer ?"

You can click on a post and it shows the little \u201ctry again\u201d circle with the arrow type of thing. If I click on a picture it\u2019s black but when I click on a reel, it appears black but opens and plays once I click it whereas the picture stays black. I can also see any accounts reel section and tagged photo section.\n\nAlso, when I log in from my browser on my laptop, there are 0 issues and I can do/see everything.\n\nIt\u2019s been over 24 hours and I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else had dealt with this.\n\nI tried to reset the phone, uninstall Instagram, and all of the basic things but I\u2019m just curious if anyone knows what to do :) Thanks\n",
