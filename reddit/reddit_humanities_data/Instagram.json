            "does anyone know how to bypass login requests? Im not logged in on any other device and i don\u2019t think i have any authenticator app or backup, i logged out of instagram when i was trying to fix a problem on another account and now i\u2019m stuck trying to fix this problem. Someone let me know. I kinda really need my instagram account so if any1 could help me out that would be much appreciated.",
            "hi, a couple of days ago my account got hacked. is a new account made with a friend for an art project, we retrieved it because we still had access to our email, but in the meanwhile, the hacker had followed around\u00a0 3k random people, when we retrieved it, it took me 3 days to unfollow all the weird accounts, but after 3 days of having my account back It was blocked and now when I log in it shows me the account is in revision for approx 24hrs for the last 3 days\n\ndoes anyone have any idea if there is something I can do?",
            "i really need help, i have a account on instagram that i made in 2017, i need to delete it! but i forgot the password, as you can imagine... The problem is, i tried many times when i was younger to change it by email, but i forgot the password too lol. when i got the right password the email was blocked (microsoft hotmail) because \"someone guessed the wrong password too many times\" and i don't know what to do, i can't change by email, i tried to get back the email but it is impossible.... i really need help\n\nexcuse my bad english",
            "Hello, I have been experiencing a login problem for 6 hours+. My instagram account keeps saying that my password is incorrect, but no matter how many times I reset it, it still says it is incorrect. However when i click to reset my password and use the password i tried to enter, it says that i cannot change it to my curent password, so i know that my password and username is correct.I really wish it isn't hacked because it is my only method of communication and community, and just for other reasons i can't make another one. Does anyone know what i can do?\n\nP.S for the past few days instagram logs me out because they 'suspect automated behaviour'",
            "Recently (for the past day or so) I've been seeing numbers next to the like, comment and share symbols on posts in my feed. This didn't use to be the case. These numbers were only displayed on reels when I went into that dedicated interface. The app is updated to its latest version, on Android.\n\nIs anyone else getting this? Is there a way of getting rid of this number spam?",
            "Hi, i wanted to learn if i can delete someone off my blockled ist without unblocking them. I blocked someone and i don't want their account to show in my blocked list.",
            "When I search for a user it says following beside their name but when I click on their profile it shows the follow button even though I never unfollowed them. Did they block me? Is this happening to anyone else?",
            "I need some help. I had my account suspended temporarily, got it back, but it's now asking me to change my password due to \"Suspicious Activity\".   \n  \nThis would be fine, except I can't remember my original password. There's a \"Forgotten Your Password\" option, but when I click this, the link takes me back to the same place where I have to enter my old password to change it. Is there any way around this? Seems like I might be locked out if I can't figure out what I used as a password the first time around...",
            "Why are my likes disappearing? I look at the likes list, and my profile doesn't appear in the list. My likes on other people's photos are disappearing frequently. Instagram think I'm a bot? ban? bug? Help \u2639\ufe0f",
            "I need help related to to IG and Meta new policy for Europeans with the new select what ads to view. The message pops up but i cant do anything about it its like the app freezes anyone else encountered this problem?"
