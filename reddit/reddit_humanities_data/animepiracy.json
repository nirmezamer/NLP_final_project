        "content": "I'm planning on rewatching Eva and finally getting around to the Rebuild movies sometime soon and want to get them up on my Plex server and then stream it to a nice CRT TV I have. I'd like to hit a nice balance of image quality and not taking up way too much server space, luckily since it's going to be on a CRT I don't care too much about high resolution. I currently have the bonkai77 encodings since they don't take up space but the more I look at them the more I hate them. Would I be best off finding a DVD rip of them instead of taking up 90GB of space for the McBalls version?\n\nThe movies won't fit on the screen so I'm gonna be aiming for 1080p for those. My download of End seems fine (doesn't have the fucked up new dub and translation) and is in 1080p and I think the downloads of the Rebuild movies have the Funimation dub so I'm not too concerned about those but will definitely take suggestions for good encodings if anyone has some they really like.\n\nI can find the links myself, I am not requesting anyone here to give me them.",

For the end of evangelion baws is nice i think, at least thats what i have on my harddrive and there was prob a reason for me to decide on it.",

        "content": "I wonder if I am correct with the statement that light novel piracy isn\u2019t what it was. \n\nIt gets slower, and even big names like Chitose imo have a slow or none available download (e.g Chitose with volume 6). \n\nLooking at the index, I realized that there never was a good central point. Manga and anime have their main contributors and additionally many mirroring pages. But light novel sources are a rare find. \n\nDo I miss some page or source? Is it really going down? And is this a first sign what could happen in other media of anime? ",

            "English LN translations from popular groups have decreased with the more and more english official translations we have recieve each year, some translations groups even became official licensors, that's good news. Small new groups have appeared and it's normal for them to be slow.\n\nTranslations for other languages have increased tho, i see several monthly new spanish releases uploaded on the most popular spanish site for LNs, it wasn't like that years ago and now i can even find things that are not available in english. German LN scene got a couple hidden new groups too, also the chinese translations increased even more, but they have always been on a different league when it comes to piracy lol",

            "As far as I know, there were many english fan translator groups but a lot got burned by both the Japanese and Western publishers to the point that if any of the novel are to be pick by the publishers, many will steer clear away from them but a few will undertake the challenge.\n\nMost of the english officials are dogshit, improperly \"localized\", and just outright destroyed the author's work.\n\nHence, many people will often rely on machine translation despite having a lot of wrong usage of words and sentences. \n\nFan translations are simple to find but hard to keep alive because 1 simple letter of DMCA will shut down all the hard work of the translators. Even if they were to jump another ship, they somehow get the said letter.\n\nAs for other languages, they seems to have more freedom and no monitoring than the english itself to me."
