            "One of the main outs on my soundboard had a problem during the gig last weekend so I need to send it in for warranty repair.\n\nI've gone back to using my D-50 cuz the patches in general cut through better than, and it has the best brass sounds compared to, the UB-Xa and VZ-1.\n\nNext week my primary band has got three gigs, we're the main band playing the downtown Ventura 4th of July Thursday parade, then Friday we're playing at one of our regular bar/restaurants, then Saturday at a place we've never played before. \n\nIn discussions with a swanky restaurant/bar in Calabasas to get my band in there, the owner just got her entertainment license and she wants to book us, we just need to finalize the date.\n\nMy side project new hair metal cover band practiced this week. We've got about 10 songs so far. Drummer says once we have a full three hours he can get us into one of my favorite bars to play at, The Garage in Ventura.",

            "Does the new EAE Prismatic pedal Wall cover the same ground as the Wingie 2? It seems like they use the same/similar language but the results sound very different...",
            "Does a 3.5mm jack (mini jack) sound cheaper than a full size 6.35mm jack? I want to connect my digital piano (Roland fp-10) to some delays and maybe a MOOD one day but it only has a 3.5 headphone out",
            "So Ive got a wasp and a perfourmer mk2. Looking for another mono or poly to give me a different flavour. I like making funky stuff, disco-y stuff.  Some front runners were the pwm mantis but Ive cooled off on that, taiga keys, analogue solutions impulse comman. As for polys the modwave is tempting but worried its too harsh. I prefer stuff I can get quick results or at least not have to menu dive in a computer screen for extended periods of time",
            "No, the connector size is about robustness and suitability for the device size. Often devices with 3.5mm outputs or inputs are more consumer vs pro gear. Occasionally devices with both type of outputs user higher quality amplifiers for the 1/4\" outputs (line) vs 1/8\" outputs (headphones).",
            "I think that's a Prophet 6.",
            "Ah that is a helpful hint - I saw a lot of demos where the user has like nothing happening on the front panel.  The Sweetwater article is also helpful.",
            "Ok - this one is pretty stupid I think, since I watched several clear videos on this topic and am still like duh? with drool running down my chin and all.\n\nLets say my interface has 16 lines in via ADAT or maybe I splurged on the Audiofuse or whatever.\n\nLets say I want to input the synths (stereo or mono) to something that sits near the synths and makes it super easy for me switch different sound sources in and out of the something\n\nAnd I want to output the something to the interface and then basically never need to touch that connection again.  \n\nSome inputs on the interface will be dedicated to certain synths, so the routing from synth, through something to interface will be fixed for the most part.\n\nBut some interface inputs I want to be able to flex, plugging synth A into the something routed to interface input 3 (for example) one moment than saying never mind and plugging synth B into the something instead to route it to interface input 3.\n\nIs the something in my use case an Audio Matrix Router or a Patch Bay?\n\nMy understanding is on a Patch Bay I have basically fixed routing, ie input 3 always goes to output 3 for example - where on an Audio Matrix Router I can send input 3 to any output.\n\nIs that the basic distinction?\n\nIf I dont plan on using outboard effects - only synth to interface - is the patch bay all I need?\n\nFinally - do I even need the patch bay?  It might be a bit messier but can I just have the cables inputting to the interface always plugged in just switch them from instrument to instrument?",
            "I need help connecting my Minifreak to the MC707\n\nI know basically nothing about connecting external gear to each other. I know I needed a midi cable so that what I bought. Other than that Im pretty much a noob. Ive tried YouTube videos but it didnt really help.\n\nId like to use the mc707 as the sequencer and the brains obviously and the minifreak for adding external synth and effects. Is there someone out there that could help me where to put what cable and what to change in the settings? Id greatly appreciate it!!",
            "So just to be sure my dumb ass is clear on this.\n\nI have a patch bay like the Samson 48 and Im running 16 inputs into the back with the respective 16 outputs running to an interface.\n\nI plug input 17 in the back but to get into the interface I take its output from the front to the input of lets just say 16.  \n\nOnce patched, the audio of 17 goes through the output of 16 into the interface and whatever was input into 16 is no longer going through the output of 16.\n\nPlease say I got this :)",
            "Yes. You got it.\n\nI have a patchbay with all my instruments going into into Inputs 1-8. The outputs of 1-8 go to my audio interface (which has 8 inputs). \n\nI then have my effects (pedals and rack mount) going into inputs 9-16). Lets assume for this discussion, Reverb Rack unit uses Inputs/Outputs 15 and 16. Distortion pedal on Inputs/Outputs 13 and 14.\n\nLets also assume, I have SynthA using inputs 1-2.\n\nNormally, without any patching, I play SynthA and it will OUTPUT to my rack interface INPUT 1-2. Now, I patch the TOP ROW of the patchbay 1,2 into the BOTTOM ROW of patchbay 15,16. Then another pair of cables from TOP ROW of patchbay 15,16 to bottom row of patchbay 1,2. This sends SynthA through Reverb and back into audio interface line 1,2.\n\nIf I move those cables and go: Patchbay TOP 1,2 to Patchbay BOTTOM 13,14. Patchbay TOP 13,14 to Patchbay BOTTOM 1/2 - Now I have SynthA going only through distortion and back to audio interface 1/2.\n\nLast step... Patchbay TOP 1/2 to Patchbay BOTTOM 13/14. Patchbay TOP 13/14 to Patchbay BOTTOM 15/16. Patchbay TOP 15/16 to Patchbay BOTTOM 1/2. I now have SynthA going through distortion first AND then Reverb, back to audio interface.\n\nThis allows for very easy connections from any instrument to any effect/pedal etc."

            "I just got through XNB's nearly 5 hours of Wavestate tutorial. I'm in love! Such a deep machine. Do you mess with the software component much?",
            "Thank you so much. The MC707 is the heart of my composition suite, in this piece I don't use it, but it provides me with a central workflow that allows me to incorporate drums, basslines and a wide range of synth sounds from the incredibly powerful synth engine. The MC707 in my view is one of the best pieces of music technology on the market, and smokes the water with Elektron. Criminally underrated.",
            "I love this combination, you get the beautifully exotic rhytmnic lanes of the Wavestate, which in my view is one of the most underrated synths in the modern era. The things you can do with this machine are gobsmacking.\n\nBlended with the warm analog dustiness of the REV2. The oscillators are wonk on this machine, and put out this horrible high frequency that I needed to EQ out, but even then it is still bad. But in the context of this piece I think the piercing nature of it adds. Sometimes its the beauty in the imperfections.\n\nAnd added, the shimmering gliss of the Hydrasynth. This machine is honestly one of the most beautiful sounding instruments ive ever played. It has a certain sweetspot in the midrange, those glassy Wavetables are unlike anything else."
