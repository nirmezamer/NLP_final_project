            "The new [Emiliana Torrini](https://open.spotify.com/album/10AV3dj0kZUPYrqQA2RrEF?si=-GbuQi2MQiiNSR3XTkbxCw) album has some chill vibes and interesting synth elements, check it out.\n\nI'm really struggling on the last track on an album that's just about ready.  I think I hit on a melody last night but now it's all down to lyrics.  The summer heat really sucks all the energy out of me, so it's been a slog getting near the finish line, and I just have to push through.",

            "I found a healthy outlet for GAS.  Instead of lusting after huge, complex synths like the Polybrute12 (pre-ordered) or any number of other things on my wishlist - Lyra (or Solar 42), Voltage Lab, Matriarch, Tempera (or GR-1?) - uh, I will channel my GAS into tiny, cheap and harmless devices like the Hyve which I have arriving today.\n\nOr Rumble of Ancient Times which I have arriving next week.\n\nOr the Gecho Loopsynth which should be here in a couple of weeks.\n\nOr the Microphonic Soundbox I have on back-order.\n\nI'm cured!",

            "I really like the Roland pitch benders found on the SH101, Juno etc but I use pads because I suck at playing keys. I\u2019ve noticed that [entire assembly replacements](https://syntaur.com/Part-4496-Bender-assembly-Roland) are sold and I\u2019m wondering if I can build an enclosure for it and properly wire a midi connection at the end of it (I do control wiring type stuff at my job) to make myself an auxiliary pitch bender. \n\nDoes anyone know if the midi CC comes from the bender itself since it looks like it has a circuit board on it, or if that happens at the circuit board where it plugs into? I couldn\u2019t find any wiring diagrams that clarified this, so those would be helpful too. Any input is appreciated.",
            "I have been thinking for a while about picking up a used Digitone. I have read the relevant sections of the guide and manual on Elektron's website and remain a bit unsure about some details of the song mode. A song mode in which I can arrange full songs is make-or-break for me (hands will be playing guitar, so I can't perform most changes within a track manually). The music I play is a bit different than what I see most folks using the Digitone for so I haven't seen examples of what I have in mind. Hoping someone can help clarify a few things.\n\nAs I understand it, I have up to one hundred twenty-eight patterns (i.e., sixty-four-step sequences) in a project and ninety-nine \"rows\" in the song mode arranger. I am looking to confirm what that looks like in practice. Let's say I typically arrange songs with three or more discrete sections, each comprised of sixteen or thirty-two measures (so each section being four or eight consecutive four-page patterns of the sequencer), of which some sections may be repeated. Possible forms are AABACA, ABBACCA, ABCBCDDB, and the like. If I am following the literature correctly, each four-page pattern of the sequencer comprises a single pattern that fills one row in the arranger. So I would add those to the arranger to look something like A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, etc. If a section of a given track requires eight patterns, then each repetition of that section would take eight rows on the arranger. And if that song has eight such sections total (e.g., ABCBCDDB), then I would use sixty-four rows of the arranger to put the whole thing together. Does this look right? Is there anything I'm misunderstanding or should be aware of?\n\nMy apologies if this is all obvious to experienced Elektron users. I'm new to the terminology and want to make sure I understand how this works before buying an expensive new gadget.",
            "So there are a million and one \"tutorials\" on \"how to mix and master\" on youtube. Most of which are either clickbait or not what I'm looking for.\n\nMy workflow is live-oriented. I don't ever really intend to actually perform in public, but I like playing \"live\", sort of evolving stuff that is mostly unplanned. Importantly, I run my mix through my interface and Ableton rather than having a mixer with physical faders.\n\nWhat do other folks do to \"mix\" this sort of thing? I always end up in situations where one or another instrument is buried, and it's always while I'm in the middle of the groove and don't want to stop to fix it. Do I just need to plan ahead more and come up with distinct areas of the mix that certain synths will sit in, and pre-EQ those spots, and keep them there? Possibly with different saved templates for each instrument and variations of them?",
            "Somewhat long winded question...  \nI'm trying to play two different synths at the same time, by looping some arpeggios with a Keystep and then switching MIDI Channel and playing some leads on a different synth over top.\n\nTo try to facilitate this, I've been trying a Bastl Midilooper. I'd like to sync the Looper with the tempo of the arpeggios, so I've been using the Keystep's clock and sending it to the Midilooper.\n\nProblem is, when you press stop on the Keystep arpeggiator, it sends a stop signal to the MIDI looper and my loop stops, so I can't switch smoothly to playing the leads. And I want my arpeggio function turned off for leads.\n\nI've tried a few different devices, and I keep running up against this wall where you have to run the clock to use the arpeggiator, but then when you stop that clock, you stop the clock that is sync'ed across all devices including loop device.\n\nDoes anybody know of a workaround for this, where I can turn off my arpeggiator, but not stop all my synced MIDI clocks across the other devices?\n\nHope this question makes sense, please ask if you need me to clarify or elaborate. Would love to get a solution here.",
            "There are two very common synth concepts that I've bumped into on my journey so far that I am unable to find great educational materials on, and really just don't know what to do with.  \n\nAnyone who can share words of wisdom, a general framework or good videos on these topics (basics especially) would be greatly appreciated:\n\n1.  **Pitch / Note stuff** - How exactly does changing the scale, creating user scales, microtuning, and other pitch options work?  What are some fun excercises, examples I could start off experimenting with?  I am familiar with basic music theory and have played guitar for decades - so not looking for the \"this is what a note is\" answer, but more the applicability to synthesis?\n\n2.  **Sync/Line-In/Out** - Is sync basically just \"clock\" or is there more to it?  Line in/out is for sampling one device with another or using the effects of one device on the sound source of another.\n\n**Bonus third technical question**:\n\nI picked up the Gecho Loopysynth which I believe only has a headphone out.  If I want that headphone out to be a line out to record this instrument via my interface/DAW is there any device I need in between, or particular. settings I should be thinking about it, or is it no big deal, just do it and adjust to taste?",
            "Does anyone know when is the PolyBrute 12 expected to be shipping out?",
            "why is passing panned audio, in hardware, such a scarce thing?\n\nmost, if not all, analog/hybrid mixers i've come across, exclude panning from their direct & aux outs. so... you can pan the channels L/R, but once output through the direct or aux jacks, they are sent \"down the middle\". All the big Mackie mixers, Yamaha, even Behringer.\n\nmost analog synths, whether VC or DC, don't even include a panning option. everything is just \"down the middle\". \n\ni don't understand why its so hard to do, or ignored, to allow a signal to be sent out panned, so that it can enter the DAW or a pedal, panned.\n\nfor example, I want my Moog panned 50% left & to feed a delay pedal. next, I want my Korg panned 100% right & to feed a vibrato pedal.\n\ni've found no way to do this in the hardware domain.",
            "New owner of a Korg OpSix (mk2) here. Loving the instrument's interface and sound, but I have run into a bit of a snag and was hoping some of you may have a solution/answer.\n\n\nFor context, I wish to externally MIDI-sequence program changes on the OpSix. Looking at both [the manual](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/manual/0/946/5046/) as well a [this forum post](http://www.korgforums.com/forum/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=126196&sid=d34f8bcc7816e1451deeb2e06f13a8bb), this should be as easy as \n\n1. Setting the MIDI instrument's selected bank (ranging from 0-9), and\n\n2. Setting its corresponding program change (ranging from 0-98)\n\n\nHowever, no matter what device I use to sequence program changes and note events, it would appear as though the OpSix first triggers the note event, and THEN executes the program change. This, in essence, means that I cannot sequence simultaneous instrument (program) changes and note events. Instead, I seemingly have to first sequence the program change and THEN trigger the note I wish to play. \n\n\nI really hope that I am just being an idiot here and either missed something in the manual or the menus or just don't have a good enough understanding of the MIDI standard. Have any of y'all ever tried sequencing program changes and how did you go about it?\n\nEDIT: this behavior appears to be consistent regardless of whether i trigger program changes and note events from my m8 tracker or Ableton clips. So it appears to be \"the fault\" of the OpSix.",
            "I can't say for sure, but I think it would be very strange for the bend control to output CC. Fundamentally the pitch bend is just a pot with a sprung handle, so the board either just routes that on (3 pins) or has a DAC and I2C/SPI (seems much less likely); if it has more pins it might have more features (e.g LEDs). Looking at the link, it has 6 wires, so I guess that connector is meant to carry both pitch bend and mod wheel (2 pots with 3 terminal each).",
            "Your description is correct:\n\n\n* A step is a time unit of a sequence in which triggers can occur and represents a musical subdivision of tempo\n* A sequence is a series of up to 64 steps\n* A pattern is a set of sequences, one per track\n* There are 8 banks (letters) of 16 patterns (numbers) per project\n* A song is a series of songs rows, which indicate what the device will play and in what order\n* A song row has a number (ordering), label (textual name for reference), pattern (bank and number), repeat count, length (number of steps from pattern to play per repeat), tempo and mute states (which tracks are muted or not)\n* There are up to 99 song rows in a song.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the steps used by a sequence don't have to be 16th beats, but they represent the narrowest time division you can sequence with.\n\n\nAlso remember, song mode was not added to the \"digi\" family for a long time. This is because the device paradigm is fundamentally that of a performance sequencer and multitimbral synth. The design was for you to perform the sequencer like an instrument. This is facilitates by features like parameter locking and conditional triggers (trigger every N times around, or with a given probability). These features allow you to make a 16 step sequence of 16 beats that actually doesn't repeat for many bars; for a drum pattern, for example, you could have some triggers happen every bar, some very 2 bars, some very 4 bars and some every 8 bars turning your 16 step pattern into 8 bars worth of drumming. Repeat that across the 4 tracks and use the song row mute states and you can make a surprisingly complex arrangement with few patterns.\u00a0Using the device to notate out very extended sequences with every note placed manually, across multiple patterns, is not very efficient. In other words, what you want to do is possible, but not really the core intent of the device and not a flow it's optimized for.\n\n\nIf you aren't going to be interacting with the device while the song plays, then you need more of a backing track than a sequencer. I'd definitely try and clarify what you need to available to you, performance wise, as a backing track doesn't have the performance flexibility of a true sequencer/synth, but is very simple to work with. You also get the freedom to use whatever you want to make that backing track (e.g more guitar parts, synths you don't bring with you etc), and mix backing tracks with other devices if you want some elements to be manipulated in realtime and some not (assuming you have a good way to sync)."
