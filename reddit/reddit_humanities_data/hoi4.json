Here you will find trustworthy military advisors to guide your diplomacy, battles, and internal affairs. \n\nThis thread is for any small questions that don't warrant their own post, or continued discussions for your next moves in your game. If you'd like to channel the wisdom and knowledge of the noble generals of this subreddit, and more importantly not ruin your save, then you've found the right place!\n\n**Important**: If you are asking about a specific situation in your game, please post screenshots of any relevant map modes (strategic, diplomacy, factions, etc) or interface tabs (economy, military, etc). Please also explain the situation as best you can. Alliances, army strength, tech etc. are all factors your advisors will need to know to give you the best possible answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Reconnaissance Report:**\n\nBelow is a preliminary reconnaissance report. It is comprised of a list of resources that are helpful to players of all skill levels, meant to assist both those asking questions as well as those answering questions. This list is updated as mechanics change, including new strategies as they arise and retiring old strategies that have been left in the dust. You can help me maintain the list by sending me new guides and notifying me when old guides are no longer relevant!\n\n*Note: this thread is very new and is therefore very barebones - please suggest some helpful links to populate the below sections*\n\n###**Getting Started**\n\n* [Hoi4 Wiki](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Hearts_of_Iron_4_Wiki) \n\n* [Wiki Beginner Guide](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Beginner%27s_guide)\n\n###**New Player Tutorials**\n\n* [Tutorial for Complete Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_uCwrt-LkA) - Quill18\n\n* [Ezekiel's Hoi4 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/GufD3sJsgrU)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n###**General Tips**\n\n* [/r/hoi4 Current Metas Thread](https://redd.it/y27mlv)\n\n* [Simple guide to land unit stats](https://redd.it/i6qafp)\n\n* [Division Stats Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF25PVnTCYYwZflYpXjxP2qIsqt116tmV)\n\n* [Intelligence Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF25PVnTCYYz5RwcxOU3VabxRsWTiWlj3)\n\n* [Simple guide to creating unit templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/hoi4/comments/k8h3fx/the_war_room_rhoi4_weekly_general_help_thread/gfwm6fo/)\n\n* [Unit templates](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2714213712)\n\n* [Ship templates](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943980823)\n\n* [Guide to Peace Conferences](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876062194)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n###**Multiplayer Tips**\n\n* [Navy micro mechanics/guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSUGxWZkTvc8lBTwKLEFx3-xfVj7KszNICpMJ3Llk7f4fX3Fwsp95-o-EAPeAb8qp0xXR90zUcivWDv/pub)\n\n* [Air mechanics/guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bQxG9WnWFgBUeNwVX0ciC1V4SoIVTTOxrdsWxBncFY/edit?pli=1)\n\n* [Division conversion guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tuTg7N3nkiVAQz7eEDmvkZwvcfqDPzSlf_vvSangV6A/edit)\n\n* [Garrison order planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUR3rEOUApB7R9bKAb2S2fD_kH2Xv-PFGzNVBXvT9KQ/edit)\n\n* [Aircraft/Tank conversion guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1toT3arAokUy9FRHOn1DTUSW4bWMFVfVrmJW0kFS4gLs/edit)\n\n* MP Country Guides\n\n  * [South Africa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3pt-SxbQflxgTck1uEVO0GGlkd-aM49yZ71-Bs0nh0/edit)\n\n  * [Australia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0-e0c-f-F8H25clRd-PJRBE4j9qz4oKQsPUq3w8Bac/edit)\n\n  * [Raj](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jN7QxK5Qw9ke6wCSclnUNkMVoE9ugbHBdebuhg42f0o/edit)\n\n  * [Brazil](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbMK8ubf1b81fjl0Lwar5wOx4lN7Yfb5fd1ncW8rjZE/edit#)\n\n  * [Mexico](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmZJqHwT7yeWDEdi0BUVXRTyyahvCU3L7VlGjE0BrEA/edit#)\n\n  * [USA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8FGZafO4klhhyavsvj7WLfEgcxz4Kl-2wWIQObtFao/edit)\n\n  * [France](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzcLtX1RRkmPJv_E6OK4K0fAHINfxfvZJT1IBGZi-4c/edit)\n\n  * [Japan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uMjptJjd6lTuKh3dJOAJdkMgSLcn94Gwdc_LsAP8ajw/edit)\n\n  * [Hungary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rY9TNkyN7Xa83jgZHxRm-7fyLqGFIccClPpJNBrc75w/edit)\n\n  * [UK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVn8KVlLmqgMq37cszOvkte0J210pjl1IQ4kjEBNvMY/edit)\n\n  * [Romania](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFzelg1huGlYStI_DZfUGVDoUpDuYum3Yj8eeRHooNA/edit)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Country-Specific Strategy**\n\n* *Help fill me out!*\n\n* [Italy - 1.9.2+](https://redd.it/gc6q5u)\n\n* [Japan - 1.9.3+ (Multiplayer)](https://redd.it/hw2zpr)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Advanced/In-Depth Guides**\n\n* [Guides to Combat Width](https://redd.it/vxcd21)\n\n* [Guide to Combat Tactics and Doctrines](https://redd.it/d7b98r) **OUTDATED, BUT STILL USEFUL**\n\n* [Comprehensive Anti-Air Guide](https://redd.it/nyd1g8)\n\n* [Guide to Ship Refit Costs](https://redd.it/x52kmc)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n**If you have any useful resources not currently in the Reconnaissance Report, please share them with me and I'll add them!

            "When you guys design ships, tanks, and planes, how do you decide when the best time is to start producing? \n\nFor example, my last game as Canada I had designed a cruiser but then I thought \u201cwell, if I just wait to unlock this tech for it I can have a better one\u2026\u201d and I get stuck in that loop of researching, researching, researching better components and I feel like I\u2019m too late by the time I have a design I\u2019m satisfied with",
            "What do I need to beat Germany as French Communists or Non-aligned? Do I focus on air? Tanks? And what year is best?",
            "How do I choose between annex or puppet. If I'm stretched for equipment I should just puppet? I earlycapped the UK last game and I don't know how to manage India or the US if I were to invade them from Canada.",
            "i unlocked combined arms specialist for one of my generals but he is not showing up as an option in military high command",
            "What is the easiest way for Finland to defeat the Soviet Union? Is this possible with only infantry troops (without tanks)?",
            "You don't need to choose - a slightly more expensive tank with the 3-man turret and radio as well as a good gun will be more efficient overall, and most of the rest is purely a choice of quality vs quantity.\n\nTechnically there's a 'good enough' point for breakthrough at ~250 - but unless you only ever plan to attack green divisions in plains that'll come back to bite you. More, and you'll do almost as well against veterans dug in in a forest instead of eating lots of expensive losses.",
            "Those two stats rarely conflict with eachother but I guess soft attack is more important to go for. There's only so many ways to add soft attack so you might aswell max it out. Tanks have excess breakthrough most of the time.",
            "You need enough breakthrough that the enemy soft attack doesn't exceed it with tactics. I go for around 250-300. You need as much soft attack as you can get. More important is keeping them fueled and supplied.",
            "For fleets, work back from when you need to have them ready and you have your cutoff point. If you want a useful fleet by 1940, they'll need to be laid down by the end of 37 unless you really have yards to spare. But even then, 2-2.5 years is the minimum lead time on good capitals, and if you're building good cruisers too you'll need to multiply by how many each line has to finish. \n\nAlso, refits. It's always worthwhile to send them for another pass to get new radar, FCS and AA once they're done, and way faster than only starting the hull once you have all those parts ready. \n\nFor planes you just try to get the airframe and engine at the same time, otherwise everything past HMGs is optional. While you don't want to be seriously outnumbered, '40 planes are a *lot* stronger.\n\nAnd tanks are just plain flexible. Start building them, design a basic division template, train it once you've built enough to fill it out, then train more or expand the template as more and newer models roll off the line. Just don't bother with upgrades between hulls and slap all the fancy new toys on the next model, it's much more efficient overall."
