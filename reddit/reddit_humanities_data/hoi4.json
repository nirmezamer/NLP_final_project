            "Hi there everyone! Still new, got five hours in! Im playing through the tutorial of Italy conquering Ethiopia, and wondering how do you make sure the troops most especially in the north keep getting supplies to advance towards the offensive plan? Do you usually keep building railroads from the port where the airfield is? Do you switch the supply priority from the horse to the two truck symbols or several of them at once? Very curious how I can be better! I won the war in a year but wanting to see if I can get it done even sooner!",
            "Unlikely to find anything decent for that tbh, and why you aren't getting much in the way of replies. Not only are most MP games modded. But anything you do find is likely to be so out of date as to be actively harmful. This is a bit of an issue with SP guides, but way worse in MP as the metas tend to be so specific. Best advice would just to try and find some MP streamers to watch if they ever play vanilla. MP is a bit off a mixed bag anyways. Are you talking a full random lobby or a game with friends? Jumping into playing a major tends not to be recommended for full MP games.. Better to play a minor and observe how it's done. If you are talking about a game with friends then just yolo no? Try things out for yourself etc.",
            "Colonial templates. You can copy one under the crown symbol on the top left of your template list, then edit that one as you please.\n\nIt'll still use a percentage of your own men depending on their autonomy, representing the homeland officers (and NCOs) being put in charge, but that's only 10% for a well-integrated territory.",
            "Expert AI mod is the best answer to this. I think it's on 5.0 atm. I'm not into most mods. This one is the exception. Once you know enough about the game vanilla becomes way too easy and the game difficulty settings are BS. For me this mod has become kind of mandatory to have fun.",
            "No. \n\nYou might want to find the strategic redeployment button if you haven't yet, though. Any unit can zip around a country in days without using fuel as long as there's a continuous rail route - just mind they'll need to recover their org after.",
            "Supply priority if you have the trucks - railroads don't do anything by themselves, they only increase capacity for the hubs they connect.\n\nAnd for winning the war faster in general, learning basic micro will see it done *far* faster. Plans are convenient, but incredibly wasteful in men and equipment and do not concentrate your attacks at all. Manually pile onto the weakest points, and you'll get much better results."
