            "Ok, so, we don\u2019t actually know exactly how deep chud here is, but the Minecraft world generally has \u201csea level\u201d around y = 63 or so with the new bedrock height at y = -64. However, we can see that the stone is still normal stone, so he must be above Y = 0. Thus, I\u2019ll make assumptions based on the following cases:\n\nA. Somewhere around Y = 30 (fairly deep hole)\n\nB. At Y = 10 (really deep hole)\n\nBoth assumptions assume that he exits the shaft at Y = 70 (it looks like he dug through a hill, so that would add a few blocks)\n\nIn either case, I think I was able to count 4 frames between launch and exiting the hole. I\u2019m on mobile so I can\u2019t check the exact frame rate, but I\u2019ll assume 60 FPS. 4 frames at 60 FPS = 1/15 of a second, so he\u2019s going anywhere between 600 to 900 m/s as a rough guess.",

            "Best shot would be to measure the blocks travelled after 1 tick and apply the in code air resistance, gravity and drag calculations to the player for the entire path to see where the height peaks. Might write up a program later and do some measurements. The player was standing perfectly on the block so it makes things easier.\n\nSADLY its on Bedrock and I specialize in Java stuff, however I'm sure smth can be figured out.",
            "Slightly skewing the results is that it looks like their speed increase the farther they get from other sprites. The first .05 seconds, they traveled 3 blocks up, then 6 blocks in the next .04, 13 blocks in the next .04, the next frame is obstructed, the next frame is their character 50 blocks-ish off the ground. From there though it gets weird again because over the next three frames they appear to travel roughly 6 blocks each time, before the ground completely vanishes.",
            "Also, if you want to truly be accurate, in minecraft canon 1 block = 3 meters so these numbers would be tripled",

So either 6 is second or third, 1 is first or third or 4 is first or second.\n \nLogically 6 cannot be first and (second or third) so it's not part of the solution.\n \nThat means that either 8 is second or 2 is third.

            "Jean Mermoz, a French aviator from the A\u00e9ropostale, friend of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, did this in 1927, flying a Lat\u00e9 17 plane : \n\n\u00ab\u00a0*Stranded at an altitude of four thousand meters on a plateau with vertical walls, he and his mechanic spent two days trying to escape. They were caught. So they gambled their last chance, launching the plane into the void, bouncing hard on the uneven ground, until they reached the precipice, where they sank. In the fall, the plane finally gained enough speed to obey the controls again. Mermoz righted it against a ridge, touched down on it, and, with water spurting from all the frost-battered tubes, already out of action after seven minutes of flight, discovered the Chilean plain beneath him, like a Promised Land.* \u00bb\n\nWind, Sand and Stars, from Antoine de Saint-Exupery (1939).",
            "It depends on the jet's specs, but at least 1147 meters in a simplified scenario.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Jet's take-off speed (assume 150 m/s)\n- Initial height\n- Air resistance \n- Aircraft mass and aerodynamics\n\nIgnoring the air resistance and aerodynamics:\n\nvelocity = \u221a(2gh)\n150 = \u221a(2 * 9.8 * h)\nheight \u2248 1147m\ntime = \u221a(2h/g) \u2248 15.3s\n\nSo the cliff needs to be at least 1147 meters high without using the engine, ignoring air resistance and the direction the fighter jet is pointing.",
            "Getting an actual number would require detailed knowledge of the plane\u2019s aerodynamics. For example: the pilot might use flaps, which add lift and reduce takeoff speed at the expense of drag. Or not, which is another calculation. Then there\u2019s the fact that even if you reach \u201ctakeoff speed\u201d, your nose is pointing at the ground, so you also have to pull up to at least level flight - which means you need more height, but also more aerodynamic data. \n\nIf you look at videos of the Red Bull Flugtag, some of those unpowered gliders do achieve level flight for short periods, after a drop of just a few metres. It would be very different for a F-16. A very rough guess from me would be at least 2000m, but without power you\u2019re not going very far. Fighter jets are not made to glide.",
            "the drag coefficient(C) for the F-16 aircraft is **0.019,** the wing area(A) is 300 ft\u00b2, and the dynamic pressure(p) is 134 lb/ft\u00b2.  but wait is this drop unpowered or are we at idle, cruise, or full throttle oooooooooooooooor afterburn full thrust?  i'd argue that if in this position, \"takeoff\" has been achieved.  goal posts of the dive are now to pull to level... weight is now on the table, are we fully fueled? lord the pedantic door is wide, air density/temp/wind...\n\nafrican swallows can do this pull to level glide (short distance to land \"on wing\" or nothing, they got good adaptive suspension) in a few meters or if \"under power\", exactly zero meters.  oddly for them, maintaining free fall actually adds distance to pull to level flight.",
            "Some Googling states that the F22 has a takeoff speed of 165 mph (74 m/s) and can reach that speed on the flat in 10 seconds. That means it can accelerate on the flat at 7.4 m/s^2. With gravity as well it would bring the acceleration up to 17.2 m/s^2. This means that it would need to fly vertically downward at full thrust for about 4.3 seconds to reach takeoff speed. Assuming uniform acceleration it\u2019s average speed during that time would be 37 m/s meaning that it would have traveled about 160m.\n\nAfter this the aircraft would need to pull out of the dive and that would require extra space. I don\u2019t know how much.\n\nSo overall 160m plus enough space to pull out of the dive if the pilot has the engines at full throttle.",
