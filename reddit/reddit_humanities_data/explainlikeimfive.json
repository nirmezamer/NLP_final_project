            "A few words of advice: watch out for those power-hungry mods on a power trip. This ain't my first Reddit rodeo. Good luck to whoever jumps into this!",
            "I love what you guys do! Hope whoever is the new mod continues the legacy! Kudos to this beautiful sub!",
            "I know it read it once years ago, but a refresher of the expectations of a mod would be helpful. I have general interest in helping mod a sub like this....but I'm worried I won't have the time to commit to the task.",
            "I hope that I will succeed with this. I am a little bit worried that I will be judged too much for past actions on this sub. I just want to let you know that I no longer wish to come across that way on this Subreddit again. I will be working hard to try and avoid any issues from now on. Thank you for your consideration.",
            "We pass over a few of those sort of applications every time. Every application gets carefully reviewed by multiple people. We then have a trial period after accepting them where new mods are watched closely (both to help them and for oversight).",
            "Thank you, we appreciate it",
            "Volume context might also help, about 50~% (roughly 10k a month) of submissions break the rules and a far larger percent of comments. If the sub was half uninteractable content with no answers I think that would be a worse experience for most people",
            "Any time is helpful. We don't keep track of how active mods are as long as they're active at all, more or less. Otherwise, just be communicative with the mod team.",
            "Great, good luck with the form then and we will take a look.",
            "Good luck. \n\nRecruitment has been really hard this last 18 months or so."

            "Almost every (wild) animal is riddled with parasites, microbes or larger critters that are making them less healthy. Meanwhile, humans in developed areas are comparatively parasite free.\n\nAdding a parasite to an infected animal will only marginally change their health, but adding one to an uninfected human can drastically hurt their health.",
            "Also a lot of animals have shorter GI tracts, so bacterial growth time is shorter. Some also have more acidic stomachs that are better at killing parasites and bacteria.\n\nOverall it's a lot of survivor bias though. We look at mature animals and think, \"how do they survive\", but don't see the ones who died.",
            "Well humans have doubled our average life expectancy partly because we have become safer in what we drink and eat",
            "They aren't fine. Wild animals drinking untreated water die all the time of waterborne illness. It's one of the leading killers of wild animals.",
            "we arent, we just got sick and tired of people dieing from bad water and can do something about it, so we did.",
            "They just die. Then you see the remaining ones, generally with parasites and disease, who just haven't died yet. Quality of life is ehhh though.",
            "The easy answer to this and all similar questions is animals babies/children die at rates prior to adulthood that we would consider unacceptable for humans in the developed world. Animals also rarely live to what wed consider old age. Consider the lifespan of most animals in captivity, versus out of captivity where they live much longer.\n\nDrinking clean water is one way we prevent babies/children from dying early and keep older, and somewhat unhealthy people from dying as well. Not to mention, not carrying a bunch of disease and parasites helps you be healthier overall.",
            "We are the only ones who know what parasites are and how they get inside your guts. Wild animals get sick all the time, if they didn't the parasites would die out",
            "ive drank from rivers/streams/lakes before and was fine, but as other people have mentioned: parasites are a thing that wild animals get pretty regularly. mostly still water is not as safe because the bacteria and microbes can breed and build up a ton more than in running water. \n\ni was in girl guides for a long time and was always really into nature and camping as a kid and we were taught that running water (like from a stream or waterfall or something) is safest, so i always drank from there if i needed to. is it the safest thing to do?? probably not, but its safer than a puddle.",
            "If you have seen those Hadza tribesmen hunting cooking videos youd see them crawling down and sucking water from a pond in the wild like lions, with an extra step of blowing on the surface to get some of that surface gunk out of the way"

            "It didn't kill all the dinosaurs. It just killed  a lot of them. You just  dont tend to think of all the survivors as dinosaurs because they still exist.",
            "Extinction events tend to kill off the most specialized (frequently biggest) species, while small generalists survive. Lots more than just dinosaurs also went extinct, and many dinosaur species survived. The ones that survived were small, and became the birds of today.",
            "It killed almost everything, dinosaur or not.  It's not like thousands of species of non-avian dinosaur died while thousands of other species lived.  The surviving types of non-aquatic amniotes consisted of about 3 birds, 12 reptiles, and 5 mammals.  The tens of thousands that exist today all evolved from those 20.\n\nAll 20 survivors could plausibly be described as \"small animal that lives underground and eats insects\"that was *the* niche that remained viable.  *No* large land animals survived (they must have been too dependent on the existence of a healthy ecosystem).  *No* surface-dwelling animals survived (surface temperatures may have gotten up to around 500F for a couple of hours in there).  *No* herbivores survived (it may have taken a couple of years for the dust to clear enough to allow sunlight to reach the surface again and plants to start coming back).",
            "All known bird species are dinosaurs. They couldn't have evolved to present day unless there were surviving dinosaurs the entire time.",
            "Because it killed much of the plant life, some plants take decades to grow while others just take a few weeks or months.  Animals that could eat grass or algae were able to survive while the ones that required eating food from fruit trees probably died out.",
            ">How did Chicxulub kill all the dinosaurs\n\nIt didn't. It killed 'most' of them; generally speaking the big ones. But many species survived that.",
            "It killed almost everything, but also, the inheritors were mammals not reptiles. Why? Because the world was a fungal decay world and our body temperatures helped us mammals compete against a world rife with fungus,  which generally can't live inside our bodies. Similarly the only dinosaurs that survived were the ones that also could regulate their temperature and were small.",
            "It didnt kill all of them, they went extinct eventually, as many many other species in the span of tens on millions of years.",
            "things that could be underground or deep enough underwater, that were small or required very little to eat to survive, or that could eat the other things that fit this criteria",
            "Part of the problem was in the aftermath food was scarce. Little animals of all sizes could eke out an existence until conditions improved but the massive huge giant animals that needed to eat simply did not have enough."

        "content": "As nuclear is already used on aircraft carriers, and with a major cargo ship not having a large crew including guests so it can be properly scrutinized and managed by engineers, why hasn\u2019t this technology ever carried over for commercial operators?\n\nSimilarly for hydrogen, why (or are?) ship builders not trying to build hydrogen powered engines? Seeing the massive size of engines (and fuel) they have, could they make super-sized fuel cells and on-board synthesizing to no longer be reliant on gas?",
        "num_comments": 164,
        "comments": [
            "There were 4 nuclear powered cargo ships: Savannah (US), Otto Hahn (DE), Mutsu (JP) and a Soviet/Russian one but I forgot its name. They were all too expensive to operate and they were decommissioned, save for the last one, which is also an icebreaker and its more useful this way.",
            "Nuclear isn't used for two main reasons. The first is cost. Nuclear reactors for ships are not easy to make or cheap. Most countries navies can't afford them for their ships. A commercial operator isn't going to pay more for nuclear then cheaper conventional engines. The amount you save on not having to buy fuel oil will never overcome the costs of buying the reactor in the first place.\n\nThe second is usefulness. Almost every nuclear powered ship is designed for something no commercial operator wants, which is staying at sea away from ports for long periods of time. For military vessels leaving an area to refuel is losing useful time. For a commercial vessel they always want to be going somewhere and those places almost always can refuel you with no loss of time.",
            "Many ports will not allow nuclear powered ships to dock. So a nuclear powered cargo ship would have very limited placed where it could pick up or drop off cargo. So its usefulness would be very limited.",
            "As far as Nuclear goes, I dont think that people have touched on the real reason the military uses it - they dont have to go into port to refuel for very long times (many years at a time). Carriers and combat ships can stay on mission for extended periods of time, submarines can hunker down for many years (really only need to come up for more food eventually), etc. If something happens and the ships cannot physically come into port, they will be ok.\n\nDont need to do this with cargo ships. Diesel is cheap enough and frankly the cost of it get priced into the cost of doing business, so the ship operators dont care too much (within reason) about the price of fuel because they are going to pass that on to the customers. Nuclear requires a lot of investment and technical staff that isnt worth the additional money.",
            "There's no point in making a ship hydrogen powered.  Hydrogen isn't really seen as a fuel but rather a battery.  You have to put a lot of energy into making hydrogen or extracting it and thus you can't get as much energy out as what you put into making it in the first place.  You might as well just skip the hydrogen and use the power source to power your ship directly.\n\nNuclear is really expensive and isn't trusted in the hands of normal people because even small scale reactors can be used to do a lot of damage if used wrong.",
            "Nuclear power is one of the most expensive ways of generating power we've yet come up with.  There have been a few civil nuclear powered ships, they've all been impossibly stupidly expensive to run.  Russia still runs a bunch of nuclear powered ice-breakers, because ocean-going ice-breakers just genuinely need so much power and for such extended amounts of time that it makes sense in that application. But it's genuinely the only application it's ever worked out for in the civil space.\n\nEven in the military space, the US gave up on running nuclear cruisers and destroyers after the cold war, once again because they cost a fortune to run. Russia only operated one class of nuclear-powered surface warship. China, Britain, and India all have nuclear submarines, yet choose to run conventionally powered carriers.",
            "I think the real question is \"why don't cargo ships use sails\". Which I'm sure is due to routes not being in optimal winds. But it would bring their fuel costs to near zero.",
            "Would it not also be a safety issue as cargo ships arent that well manned and would need to protect themselves against pirates and others whod use a nuclear reactor for terroristic gains etc?",
            "Because their expensive and cargo ships don't need the ability to stay out at sea for potentially years at a time. They have to dock to unload cargo pretty regularly and can top up on fuel when doing so.",
            "I would imagine any ship carrying nuclear material would have to have all kinds of extra security onboard and probably extra ships to accompany it, which would add to the already high cost."

            "You can have blank spaces in passwords. common password lists very rarely have them and longer passwords are better. Though a famous quote will be worse than something more personal or more random.\n\n What I don't recommend is using them at the start or end of a password. Applications routinely strip white space from the start and end of submitted strings and it's very easy for a developer to forget to make an exception for passwords (or not realize they're supposed to) and you may find your password doesn't work (potentially after an update).",
            "Yes. Most places allow spaces in passwords. Passphrases are more secure than passwords because of the increased length. Correct horse battery staple.",

I'm a dev myself so I get it but half of all sign up forms I've ever used are atrocious and annoying re: password constraints.",
            "For simplicity and to avoid errors with copy/pasting etc, its often better to just ban spaces. There are enough other characters that it wont have a significant effect on the strength of a password.\n\nSpaces are also an invisible character, so it can be difficult to tell if one is there or not, or if your password has two or three spaces in a row",
            "I used to regularly threaten that if someone kept annoying me, I'd set backspace to be a valid password character on their computer.",
            "On unix, not sure about now, but back in the day, even backspace was a valid key for a password.",
            "My windows login is a single space-bar so I'm not sure what you mean.\n\nAll characters including Enter/Return and space-bar are represented equally in the nitty gritty, they're just displayed differently for the user. Often Enter activates one of the continue buttons, so while it can technically be a password, it'd be more trouble than its worth in practicality.",
            "An issue with spaces in user names is that it allows someone to cheat by copying someone else's name and then adding a space to the end, making it print out as the other individual, essentially violating the requirement that all user names are unique."
