Plus unlike the USA they can legally buy their own alcohol, so there isn't anything stopping them.\n\nSo its not one single family dropping 100k on a single party, its 1,000 18-19 year olds all spendng 100 bucks each, sometimes more.",
            "To celebrate being done with high school and be ready for the adult life.\n\nTradition went apeshit after entrance of \"russ\"-merchandise private companies selling shit at outrageous prices: special russ-uniform, \"business cards\" with funny personal quote, etc.\n\nThere is also some competition about having the best russ buss, which is often sprayed with crew specific concept art all over. The buss is modified to have a lounge like long seats, disco lights and absurd sound system.\n\nPrep for this month starts a year prior, these days, and carefully planned. With up to several pre-releases and a release of concept.\n\nThe whole tradition got messed up all sideways lately. Buss crews asking underage girls for sexual favours to be able to \"roll\" with the crew on the buss. Hard drugs being used by 18 year olds and often underage youth as well. Most of them are basically functioning alcoholics for the time period, with rational exceptions of course. There are often cases of rape, with it being filmed and spread on sosial media.\n\nIts fucked up, imho. It wasnt like this.

            "Imagine it is the last 3 months of 13 years of school and THE most important exams of your life to date is comming up rapidly. These exams determine if you get the grades to get into pre med or law or any other higher educations. Most would buckle down and study day and night. Norwegians though.... PARTY TIME!!! You then join a team usually red or blue and get into your chosen color jumpsuit and hat and you do challenges. Some of them innocent like wear a pyjamas to school. Others are more sinister like be drunk for 3 days, have sex with X partners, to the more problematic kidnap a russ on the opposing \"team\" (most times with concent, sometimes not...) or perform a stunt like \"hide and sleepover\" at IKEA. For completing these challenges you get an object in your hat like achievements for all to see. This though is not the main issue and is fairly cheap and traditionally a group of 4 or 5 Russ would buy a wreck of a old van and pimp it up. Team colors, art, group name and a few speakers to blast music all night long. This was usually not a huge cost, vans bought from the scrapyard and some paint was 2 grand at most but in the last 10 years or so there is a trend to forgo the shitty van and instead 15-20 Russ will buy a party buss (still from the scrap heap) with heavy metal concert level sound systems, dance floor and roofdecks and what not. Oh and a driver because you all are obviously to young to get a bus license and besides you all are drunk anyway. This can quickly add cost up into the 200-300k $ area and as the busses are leased from specialised firms at very sketchy leasing contracts, many Russ are stuck neck deep in debt after graduation. Because of laws, only one person can sign the leasing contract and is then finansially responsible. This makes them the chief of the group collecting money from the members. But every year there are examples of a group exployting or pressure someone into signing the leasing contract and then to bail on them leaving them stuck with the entire loan and this happens fast, 200k divided by 20 might be doable but if that goes down to 17 the cost is rising and it is a rat race to leave the group and the poor sod who signed the lease cant leave! And believe me he will not get a new group...",

They get party buses with massive sound systems and customs songs for their buses, spending a million kr + in the process. \n\nUp north some people buy a junky van, give it a paint job and that's it.

But at some point won\u2019t we completely run out of possible image combinations making them obsolete or is it something that regenerates a new site to QR connection? (On mushrooms so I might not have asked this very well lmao)\n\nBasically will we run out of QR codes and if not how is there an endless supply? ",
        "num_comments": 120,
        "comments": [
            "The thing about QR codes is they aren't just a short code that links to the URL, they are the entire URL. It's the equivalent of converting the URL into binary and then drawing the resulting 1s and 0s as black and white squares.\n\n\nTherefore as long as we don't \"run out\" of URLs we won't run out of QR codes.",
            "Think about a UPC code, those stripes you see on packages at the store.  How those work is the thickness of the stripe encodes information, black lines are 1 and white lines are 0, so the computer scans it and sees something like 0001010100010101010110111010100101.  That's just a number, and computers are good at taking numbers and looking on a list to see what the number is for.\n\nThe QR code is like a two-dimensional version of that same thing.  Because it's 2D, they can pack more 1s and 0s into the same space, so it can include letters and other stuff instead of just numbers, which is why it's used instead of a really long bar code.",
            "QR code is more of an font than anything else. It doesn't link to anything. It's just a text written out in this specific \"font\". \n\nYou can use QR codes for many different things than just urls. You can have ones with text, image, game,....\n\nYou can fit in them about 4296 alphanumeric characters, so that should give you a lot of combinations.",
            "So one thing to keep in mind: QR codes are just a way of writing something (such as a url to a website) in a way a computer can easily make sense of it reliably. That is to say, QR codes are not \"linked\" to anything, they're just a different way to write. You can use a QR code generator yourself to try it out and note same input always gives same QR code.\n\nNow to answer your question, QR code combinations, that is to say, all the ways we can arrange the black and white squares to make unique messages, depending on standard, amount to more than there are atoms in the universe, so, in theory yes, in practice no.",
            "The most primitive QR code standard has 10^132 possible combinations, which is 10^52 times as many atoms in the observable universe. Since then, we have upgraded the standards to hold much more data. We will never run out of combinations.",
            "QR can store arbitrary information. Small black squares represent 1, white squares 0. This way you can directly construct binary numbers from it. These binary numbers can be a text (see ASCII table that converts 2 digit hex number - which is 2x8 binary digits - to a single character like 'a' or 'X'). That's how you can encode an URL or any other text into QR code.\n\nHowever, you and me, we can create our own system, e.g.:\n\n0000 ...hello  \n0001 ...something bad happen  \n0010 ...I will come to you  \n0011 ...do nothing  \n0100 ...how are you?  \n0101 ...good  \n0110 ...bad  \n0111 ...afraid  \n...etc.,\n\nand then we can encode a message (one or more of these) into one QR code. So - we can create an app for us that will take that text, convert it to those numbers & those numbers it will put into QR code. On other phone, the same app could scan the QR, get those number from it and then convert those back to the original text.\n\nQR codes can be big and store a lot of information. See  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR\\_code#Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Design)\n\nInteresting thing is also that QR codes are immune to damage or imprecise reading by the camera. Simple idea behind error correction codes is that you put there some additional information that helps in guessing what was the original, i.e. let's encode just two words: \"yes\" and \"no\" like this:\n\n00000 ...yes  \n11111 ...no\n\n...then the message:\n\n00100 00001 00111 11110 01001 10111\n\nwas probably \"yes yes no no yes no\". If you receive e.g. \"00111\" it is more likely that it was \"11111\" than \"00000\".",
            "QR codes are just zeroes and ones, black and white that can be converted from binary to text. You can cover up some of the code because some of the bits in the image are for redundancy and you can use some fancy math to fix the code. There are different sizes of QR codes so you can fit more content in them.\n\nIt is basically just the link or any other piece of text as ones and zeroes plus some extra to repair the text.",
            "Answering the \"can we run out of qr codes\" part.\n\nCould we? Yes. How many combinations are there? Yes.\n\nThere are bigger qr grids, different encoding methods, different ways to do error correction... So you can create different qr codes that contain the same data after coversion.\n\nThere are also useless qr codes: like creating a code for the text AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. So there are millions of qr codes that are already wasted.\n\nOr unreadable codes, imagine a checkerboard pattern. You can't read that (even if it had eyes and the 010101010 connecting lines between the eyes. Yes all qr have, by definition, lines of alternating black and white dots between the \"eyes\" of the code). A checkerboard pattern wouldn't have a header to tell the size, encoding and error correction used. There a million of patterns that would not result in a complaining qr code.\n\nYet, there's still millions of ways to create different URL addresses, presentation cards, mail addresses, WiFi info and all the other stuff a qr can contain like, even a game... https://youtu.be/ExwqNreocpg",
            "Alphabet only has 26 characters, we're yet to run out of \"combinations of letters\" that are useful to us.\n\nA QR code can store kilobytes of data.",
            "Can we ELI5 what happens inside your phone when you open your camera app and it suggests the url? It\u2019s a computer vision problem essentially. But it\u2019s presumably looking for the corners and then determining the \u201cbits\u201d within that frame. Is there more to it?\nDoes every phone use the same CV algorithm?"

It had an enclosed cab, lights, brakes, steering wheel, battery, starter switch, pneumatic rubber tires, and reached 45 mph.\n\nYou were just born too late.",
            "Because they keep adding stuff to cars.\n\nNewer safety and reliability and fuel efficiency tech.\n\nA lot of that stuff isn't visible, but are both much less likely to get you injured or killed in a crash, and much less likely to have one in a newer car than an old one.  Ideally they are also better integrated with tech and have more reliability monitoring etc.  \n\nSome markets (usually the developing world) have very cheap cars that might share a model name with a western car, but a lot of them have fewer crash protections or mitigations, slower tech etc.\n\nYou can make cheaper cars, but remember they need to exist in the whole markets. So the EU you need to do everything from the dense slow miserable streets of a big city, to 130km/h highways in France or the autobahns in Germany.  In the US you have NYC and Los angles, and Texas highways that are like 135km/h speed limits. \n\nMy 2020 model year car has twice the engine displacement (and twice the horsepower) of my model year 2015 car, yet used about 60% the fuel/km as the old one. And that's not even a full change in generation (granted, different cars, a bmw 328i to an m850i but same manufacturer).\n\nSome of it is also just customer choice.  People want more space, more speed, less maintenance headaches (my new car has laser headlights that should last more than 10 years, my 1993 dodge had headlights that lasted 2, but were 1/10th the price or less). \n\nI don't have time to look for a source, but years ago Tata made a car in India for 1500 bucks. It was... A car.  That occasionally caught fire, but was cheap.  To make it safe enough to sell in North America would have increased the price to something like 15k. You can have cheap, or you can have safe. Regulators have generally settled on safe.  The EU values pedestrian safety more than the US, but since the big manufacturers want to make the same car for all markets those benefits tend to be spread out pretty well.",
            "A lot of technology has become cheaper because mechanical parts have been replaced by computers.\n\n\n\nFor example washing machines used to have this long complex system of cams and switches to control the program (it was attached directly to the control dial which is why it would turn as the program ran). Carefully tuned electromechanical parts = expensive.\n\n\nNow you just throw a 5 cent microcontroller and some relays in there and you're done.\n\n\nCars with internal combustion engines are full of dumped mechanical parts that you just can't get rid of, so they will always have a price floor because of that. Add to this increasing safety and emission standards and the price stays high.\n\n\nWith far fewer moving parts electric cars have the potential to be cheaper, but the material that the giant batteries are made of is expensive keeping the price up.",
            "They do, but they also have to appeal to what consumers demand. The initial tooling costs are high on a new model, depending on how many things are designed specifically for it vs being shared among sister models and brands. They have to hire whole engineering teams, have to do testing, have to throw thousands of pounds of materials from plastics to aluminum to steel to cloth together, and have to generate a profit after the manufacture and assembly of thousands of parts, with some respectable percentage of these parts mandating precision and plenty of machine time which drives costs up.\n\nOne of the cheapest new cars right now is the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage ES, at about $17K MSRP. And even then, on one of the cheapest brand spanking new cars on the market, the demand for creature comforts means including power windows, running ducts to the back for HVAC, steering wheel buttons, keyless entry, a radio complete with 4 speakers and Bluetooth, 12V outlet, USB outlet, a 6-way adjustable driver seat, and a split rear seat that folds down.\n\nThis is in addition to things that are required by law, or to meet standards, or as part of the sales pitch regarding safety. A bunch of air bags, ABS, rear door child locks, a LATCH system, TPMS, 3-point seatbelts. It also has to hit certain MPGs both as part of the sales pitch and to help the manufacturer meet CAFE standards, and this means a more advanced engine design. More valves per cylinder, VVT, advanced electronic engine/powertrain control, an electronic throttle body to allow governing and simplified software-based cruise control, on and on.\n\nAnd this is just the base model, and while these features often have software involved in them these days, there is a physical component to every single one as well, and is not purely a software feature. The software itself also costs money to develop, of course, though I'm disregarding that as a one time cost we can include with the above-mentioned engineering team.\n\nThey could be cheaper without all this stuff in terms of upfront cost, but the law and the market demands most of it which counters a lot of potential savings.",
            "Imagine if we artificially inflated the prices of TVs coming from China / India / South Korea (using tariffs) until it was actually cheaper to buy ones made here. And then we legislated the role of special TV dealerships, which operated independently and (by design) needed to be taking their own cut on every TV sale. Then we built up 80+ years of well-meaning regulations for how TVs must be built, effectively making it borderline impossible for new TV manufacturers to get off the ground.\n\nIf we did that, the prices of TVs would rise faster than inflation, too.",
            "Car *standards* have risen considerably over the years. For example, backup cameras weren't required in new cars ten years ago. Airbags weren't mandatory in the early 1990's. Lane departure warnings and similar are even newer requirements (google says 2022). All of those features require new systems to be added, and it all adds to the cost. Many of these features *used to* be add-ons that you could get with higher trim packages, but are now in all cars, raising the base price.\n\nAdditionally, some of the materials in cars can be quite expensive. You may have heard about catalytic converter theft becoming a bigger issue - it's because that particular car part contains platinum, palladium and/or rhodium.",
            "Those of us who grew up in the 1970s witnessed technology creep firsthand. In 1975 only fancy cars had automatic windows and power steering. Most cars only had AM/FM radios, trucks only had AM.  Airbags weren\u2019t in any passenger cars, crumple zones hadn\u2019t been invented, etc. \n\nIgnoring everything other than safety features and in-vehicle entertainment (Bluetooth, satellite radio, etc), you\u2019re still talking about thousands of dollars of technology. Having totaled both a 1981 pre-airbag car and a 2005 post-airbag, post-antilock brakes, post-crumple zones car, trust me, be happy the more expensive safety features are installed.  Cars are much easier to total now because they intentionally disintegrate on impact to absorb energy, but they\u2019re much easier on our bodies.",
            "Cars are \u201ccheaper\u201d, you probably just aren\u2019t comparing like cars. There are tons of cars that have the zero to 60 time of super cars 20 years ago. Regular full size trucks have significantly more towing capacity than duallies from 20. Modern family vehicles have more safety features than the high end luxury cars from 20 years ago. \n\nThe price of cars has gone down relative to what you car getting. But the issue is that everyone wants a lot more than they used to.",

Car prices do benefit from technological advances.\n\nThe 2024 Civic also has a lot more tech in it, and has been designed to be safer. The price reductions for TVs and smart home devices is reflected in the new Civic having touchscreens and other digital displays, plus tech for automatic braking all standard. It also certainly has more airbags and safety features than the 1995 model.\n\n\"Cars\" in general have gotten more expensive because people are opting to drive larger vehicles (SUVs/trucks) than in the past, and those are inherently more expensive. Many people are also choosing higher trim models (EX vs LX, Premium vs Standard, etc) which drives up price.",

By ceding control of their monetary policy, countries who have an economic downturn have significantly fewer tools available to them to address it. Why would Germany and France weaken their currency because Greece is having an economic downturn.",
            "In general sharing a currency is beneficial if those places/people have certain freedoms of movement, exchange of goods and services, and investment.\n\nThere's a concept called \"[optimal currency area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area)\". It says that any currency has an optimal coverage that, if met, then the benefit of having the same currency is the maximum possible. If the actual area is smaller, then the places outside could benefit by having the same currency as the one you defined, and if the actual area is bigger, it would be beneficial for those places that share a currency to have different ones, maybe because there are certain limits on how people, goods and/or capital could move from one place to the other.",
            "Why would the US want to tie its economic policy and currency with, say, Venezuela?",
            "You would need to have uniform rules and management of it, and that'd be a tough thing to get diverse countries like the US, Canada, China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea to agree to.",
            "Effective monetary/currency policy is heavily dependent on economic factors which vary from nation to nation.",
            "1.  Firstly, it'd require all countries (and their politicians/leaders/kings) to agree to one currency.  Then the question arises: what currency will they use?  Why should the Chinese use USD?  Why should North Korea think all this is nothing but an American plot?  Why shouldn't Islamic countries say that Christian currency doesn't adhere to Islamic values?  You get the point. \n\n2.  How will a country convert to the common currency?  Will you base it on prevailing exchange rate?  If so, countries that are poor now, but growing fast will suffer.  If it's based on purchase power parity, large populous countries like India and China will suffer.  Basically, nobody will agree to a meaningful conversation rate (because it's complicated) \n\n3.  Trade between countries today affects the relative exchange rates between their currencies.  Moving to a common currency will significantly hit export oriented countries like China, India and USA.  So they won't agree to a common currency.\n\n4.  Money as a behavior modifier:  Powerful countries like USA use their dollar value to impose sanctions on misbehaving countries (like Russia right now).  Using a common currency removes this incredibly powerful lever, or makes it vastly complex.\n\n5.  There's no value to a common currency.  Whatever you can do with a common currency, you can already do with individual currencies.\n\nEurope was an incredible rare case where you had group of countries that were all small, politically stable, financially stable and rich (through slave trade and colonization, but let's not go there now).  They also have common political values and common enemies.  They've been cooperating on mutual defense for hundreds of years (individual countries, although not collectively).  They've been cooperating on mutual defense recently as NATO for the entire continent.  So merging the currency was relatively simpler.",
            "Monetary policy is generally best determined at the country level, and a large group currency like the euro comes with some huge downsides that are not always apparent right away. \n\n  \nWe saw the big downside of a single currency when Greece had financial issues years ago. If Greece had its own currency, the financial crisis would have weakened the it's currency relative to that of its neighbors. While this isn't great, it acts as a sort of cushion. A weaker currency means that exports are cheaper. This means that as a country gets in a worse financial position, other countries want to buy more of it's goods, helping to raise the economy.\n\nWhen you have single currency, the whole eurozone changes as one. This means if one eurozone country has issues, there is no way cushion, and downturns will be worse. \n\nOn the opposite side, a single country gives huge benefits to stronger economies like Germany. Normally, if your economy is very strong, your currency will strengthen and decrease your exports. But again, even though Germany has been doing well, that natural swing in relative currency values does not happen.\n\nThus, you can kind of think of a single group currency as almost a wealth transfer from the poorest countries to the richest countries in a way that makes crises worse.",
            "Control. Nations exert control over their economy by deciding how much of their money to print. Once you have a unified currency, nations no longer have that control. Europe managed to get it done because it's relatively compact, mostly similar, and they have broad agreement on other things, such as the European Union itself. But that isn't at all possible on a global scale.",
            "UN: let's use a single currency \n\nCountries: make me\n\nThat's it. UN can't make any country (especially when the country isn't a failed state) to do anything.",
            "To have unified currency you need to have unified monetary policy.... that is a lot of independence for an country to give away. Tax policy and all sorts of very critical things depend on it. Eurozone is very unusual in how tightly different independent countries are allied and how much the laws and policies are aligned. Without such a deep alliance, you can't really share a currency. Well, you can have dollarization, but that's not quite the same thing, its a very raw deal for the country using a currency it doesn't control."
