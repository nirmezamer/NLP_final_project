        "content": "I am putting this up here to help answer some basic questions that get asked here all the time and some additional info for the beginner.\n\n##System Specs\n\nMake sure you have at least the minimum specs on your machine. See the Puget Systems link under \"What computer hardware should I buy?\" in the side bar or this link: \nhttps://www.pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/adobe-after-effects/hardware-recommendations/ \n\n8GB is not going to cut it when 32GB RAM is currently minimum recommended.\n\n**AE is not GPU based** and only a few effects access the GPU.  Faster CPU is the better Option .\n\nAE will use as much RAM as you have available.  It eats RAM like a fat kid in a candy store. The more you have the better it will be for you.\n\n\n##Performance\n\nAE works best if you do not have other apps running at the same time. Apps like Chrome are a resource hog and will slow your system down.\n\n\n##Install System Updates\n\n Depending on your GPU card...Make sure you have the **\"Creative Drivers\"** (AMD) OR the **\"Studio Drivers\"**(NVDIA) installed for your specific GPU and all other system drivers are up to date as well. **Note: Recent GPU drivers have been known to cause issues and you may need to roll  back 1 version to correct it.**\n\nAlso of Note: some system settings can cause crashes in windows OS. If you get a BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death) error write it down and seek help via microsoft's site. Often it is a very simple OS setting tweek that will fix it. \n\n\n##Project Do's\n\n**SAVE YOUR PROJECT AS SOON AS YOU CREATE A NEW PROJECT AND RESAVE IT OFTEN** This turns on the auto save feature.  Make sure you know where the auto save file folder is located. Also saving a copy of a project on a separate drive is a good idea.\n\n**Name your layers.** Selecting a layer name and pressing **enter on the keyboard** will allow you to type in your own custom layer name.  Naming layers will allow you to find them again.\n  \n**Comps** can also be renamed by doing so in the project panel, using the same process as layers.\n\n**Precompose layers.** Go Menu, Layers, Pre-compose (ctrl/cmd + shift + C)  Some effects actually need the layer/s to be precomposed in order to work.  It also can help clean up your timeline.\n\n##Project Do NOT's\n\n**AE is not a video editor(NLE), it is a compositing software that is capable of animation. Do not edit footage in AE.**\n \n**Edit footage in an NLE such as Premiere.  Use AE for motion graphics and VFX's.**\n\n**Mp4** sources can and do cause issues in After Effects. Do not use mp4 in AE projects, Convert to Prores 422 or 444 first using Adobe Media Encoder. \n\n**MP4 is a lossy format & will just make your system have to work harder.** It will slow things down because your computer has to decompress the footage to make it usable. \nMp4 can also contain codecs that will give issues such as VFR (Variable Frame Rate) footage(Game footage and Go Pro, are most likely sources for this) \nThese are known to cause severe issues with AE.  Render all mp4's to Prores first using media encoder.\n\n**NO MP3.**  Use .wav or .aiff audio files. \n\n**Do not directly export to mp4 out of AE via Media Encoder.** Use AE native render engine. \n \n** Note: A 2 step render is preferable. First export as Prores using AE native render queue, then convert that file to mp4 via Media Encoder.**\n\n##Speeding Up Work Flow\n\nIf possible work in 1/2 to 1/4 resolution.  Change this back to full resolution before rendering.\n\n**Set Preview in 1/2 to 1/4 resolution in Preview control panel.**\n\nMake sure that there are no other apps running.  Including unseen apps in the background that are eating resources. **Note: Chrome is super resource intensive and should not be running while using After Effects.**\n\n**AGAIN Do not use compressed formats in AE; it only slows your system down.**\n\nDisable CPU and GPU intensive effects (example blur and glow) in the effects control panel by clicking the \"fx\" box in the panel next to the effect name OR in the \"fx\" box located in time line, during your creation process.  **Important: Turn them back on before rendering.**\n\n \n##Previews\n\n**You must allow AE time to render out/create a RAM preview before you can actually watch a preview.** \n\nThe Green Bar at the top of the time line is an indicator of RAM preview progress. \n\nA blue bar indicates frames that have been cached to hard drive memory. \n\nAE needs two or more frames for a RAM preview to work and will be based on your **Work Area Bar length.** You can adjust the work area bar by pressing the b and n keys in conjunction with the CTI(Current Time Indicator) placement\n\n**Preview Settings Control Panel** sets the frame rate for the preview and can allow you to skip frames when previewing which may be helpful in speeding up RAM preview and extending the length of the preview. You can also set RAM preview to be the length of your work area bar in the preview panel and may be helpful in conserving RAM.\n\nSetting preview to **auto** will make RAM previews at the preview window settings. If you are working at 1/4 resolution it will preview at 1/4 resolution.\n\nWork in 1/2 - 1/4 resolution.** This will extend your preview length and speed up RAM preview render time. Go Full quality when rendering out or you want to check final quality in the RAM preview.\n\nIf you are still having issues then play the time line through 1 time and it should play perfectly till you make a change to the layers/composition.\n\n\n##Comp and Time Line\n\nEverything runs in a composition OR \"Comp\" for short.\n\nComp Settings first appear when you create a new comp ctrl/cmd + N\n\nComps time duration can be adjusted via the Composition Menu at the top of the screen. **IF** you need to access the Comp drop down menu **Go: Menu, Composition, Composition Settings,** OR hotkey **ctrl/cmd + K**  to open the dialog box where you can set the composition: Size, Pixel Aspect Ratio, Frame Rate, Start Time and Duration.\n\n**00:00:00:00  =  Hours: Minutes: Seconds: Frames**\n\nA comp will only play the duration of the composition. If your footage is longer than composition duration it will not play past the end of the comp and you **must increase composition duration** or move the footage bar by dragging it to the right or left to the specific area you want shown in the project.\n\nMake sure you are not completely zoomed into the time line and showing each frame. Those number are not seconds they are frames when zoomed in completely. The slider bar at the bottom the time line panel can fix this. **Or see the hotkey section below for hotkey short cuts to zoom in and out of the time line.**\n\n**Composition settings** is where you set your Composition size, duration, frame rate, Pixel Aspect Ratio(**Be sure to select square pixels**)resolution and the back ground color(Note: background color does not render). In the advanced section tab you can set the anchor point location, preserve frame rate, preserve resolution when nested, motion blur and samples per frame **but for now you should leave those advanced settings alone**.\n\n##Cache\n\n**Clear your Cache often. Menu, Edit, Purge, All Memory and Disk Cache. ** 100GB dedicated to the cache is a good minimum, less than that and you will have to clear your cache more often to avoid errors and unwanted frames popping up in a comp.  Also of note: if you do not have enough free hard drive space available you will get an **\"out of memory\"** error.  Disk space is important in AE. It is great if you are able to dedicate an entire separate drive to the cache, but not all here have that luxury. Also Disk Cache should be located to your fastest drive. SSD are generally much faster than HDD.\n\n\n##Starting Out\n\nTake the time to learn the basics. **See side bar for beginner tut links.** There are also other Learning resources listed there. After that a search will get you tuts for pretty much anything you need. **Search** *how to do __X___ in After Effects*. \n\nThere are many, many free and paid learning resources and courses out there.\n\n\n##Panels\n\nIf you do not see a panel in your workspace you can access them by going **Menu, Window and selecting from the drop down list**.\n\n\n##Plugins\n\nThere are tons of free and paid plugins for After Effects; but you should know how to do the effect without them first. Plugins are meant to speed up work flow and should not be used in place of a lack of knowledge.\n\nA few free plugins I have used that you may find helpful:\n\n**Video Copilot:**\n\nSaber https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/saber_plug-in/\n\nFX Consul https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/fx_console_plugin/\n\nColor Vibrance https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/color_vibrance_plug-in/\n\nVC Orb https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/ultra_3d_earth/\n\nSure Target https://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/sure_target_2/\n\n**Ukramedia:**\n\nDeLayer & Bouncr (scripts) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF_5I99MFZI\n\n**Plugin Everything:**\n\nThicc Stroke https://www.plugineverything.com/thiccstroke\n\n**RowByte**\n\nColor Wiggle https://www.rowbyte.com/color-wiggle\n\n **Motion Design School**\n\nhttps://motiondesign.school/products/motion-tools/\n\n##Learning\n\n**Learn the principles of Animation.** Books: \"The Illusion of Life\" and \"The Animators Survival Kit\" are good resources.\n\nAGAIN: **There are many paid and free learning resources out there a search will get you many courses to choose from; there are also educational links in the side bar.**\n\n##Keyframing\n\nOnce you have clicked on the stop watch icon you have set your first keyframe. \nAll additional keyframes will be made automatically for that property when you change parameters/value of that property.  Clicking the stop watch again removes all keyframes from that property.\n\nLearn to use the Graph Editor and Easing/Bezier keyframes. Select keyframes and press F9 hot key.\n\nUnless specified AE is set to Bezier keyframes by default and will cause issues with unwanted motion then using two keyframes of the same value over time.  If your object moves when it is not supposed too then it is because you have Bezier keyframes. Set them to linear.  \n\n**Set to linear keyframe in the Preferences.** Go Menu, Edit, Preferences, General and select checkbox: **Default Spacial Interpolation to Linear**. OR select keyframes and R Click on keyframe and select linear option from dialog box OR **ctrl/cmd + Alt + K** to open keyframe interpolation dialog box.\n\n\n##HotKeys\n\nLearn to use hotkeys and learn how to assign your own hotkey if one does not yet exist.\n\nSelect the layer and press a key. Some hotkeys to get you started:\n\n    a = opens anchor \n    p = opens position\n    r = opens Rotation\n    s = Opens Scale\n    t = Opens opacity\n    u = Open all layers with keyframes\n    uu = Opens and Closes all modified/edited properties\n    e = Opens and Closes Effects\n    ee = Opens and Closes Expressions \n    L = audio level keyframe\n    LL = show waveform\n    ctrl/cmd + M = Render Queue\n    Tab = Jump back to comp or inside the comp\n    shift + / = automatically fits comp view to fit up to 100% in viewer also handy to retrieve lost viewer\n    - and = keys on keyboard = zoom out and zoom in for the time line.\n    * on numpad = sets marker on selected layer if no layer selected then it set marker on work  area bar.\n    b and n = sets work area bar beginning and end in conjunction with CTI(Current Time Indicator) location\n    ctrl/cmd + D = Duplicates selected layer.\n    ctrl/cmd + shift + D = splits layer.\n    ctrl/cmd + z = Undo\n    ctrl/cmd + shift + z = Redo.\n    ctrl/cmd + Alt + K = Opens Keyframe Interpolation box\n    Alt/option + Mouse Wheel = Selects/scrolls open comps in time line panel\n\nThere are many more Hotkeys. To many to list them all. I will add that you can create your own hotkey short cut by going **Menu, Edit, Keyboard Short Cuts**  or (**ctrl + Alt + '** ) to open the keyboard short cut editor.\n\t\n\n\t\n##Renders\n\nAE mostly uses CPU for rendering except for certain effects.  A faster more powerful GPU may not help all that much.  A faster CPU is a better option when selecting a processor for your system.\n\nA render is always done inside of the **Work Area Bar** located at the top of the time line window. Using hotkeys B and N will set the beginning and end of the location of the Work area bar, make sure to move the CTI(Current Time Indicator) to the beginning and to the desired end before using  B and N hot keys. Also this sets work area for previewing and rendering.  \n\nYou can batch process Renders in the Render Queue so it is possible to make multiple videos; but only 1 per comp at a time.  However, you can set up multiple comps to be rendered one after the other in the Render Queue.\n\nLesser compression formats on the codec for renders = faster renders, but will have larger file size; but also will have higher quality. \n\n**Prores** is an intermediate compression codec.  A balance of good quality and lower file size than an uncompressed render.\n\n**Image Sequence** (.jpg, png) can be helpful especially if you are having, or are concerned about renders failing, and will allow you to pick back up at the place where the render failed or at least identify the frame to which the render failed so you can take corrective action in the composition. The down side is file size will be larger.\n\n**Render codec selection settings** can be changed by clicking on the **blue words** next to the words **Output Module** in the Render Queue. \n\n**To access or send a comp to  Render Queue use hot key (cmd/ctrl + M)**\n\nRepeating myself here with good reason: **A 2 step render is preferable. First export as Prores or Image Sequence(jpg or png) using AE native render queue, then convert that file to mp4 via media encoder.**\n\n##Speeding Up Renders\n\nMake sure that there are no other apps running in the background eating your system resources. This may also include apps that are unseen and may require you to modify how your system operates**(NOTE don't mess with your system unless you absolutely know what you are doing, you can cause yourself lots of problems including crash and making your system non bootable)** \n\nIf your system will support it use Multi-frame rendering Located in your Preferences.  GO Menu, Edit, Preferences, Memory and Performance and select the Enable Multi-Frame Rendering.\n\n I have had faster renders out of AE using AE native Render Queue than I have Media Encoder.  Remember that less compressed formats do render faster than highly compressed(lossy) formats.\n\nYou can also look into rendering apps like Render Garden.\n\nPressing **Caps Lock** suspends live render preview as it is rendering. It may help a bit.\n\nIf you system can handle it.... you can also try setting Video Rendering and Effects to **Mercury GPU Acceleration(OpenGL)** in the Project Settings.  **GO Menu, File, Project Settings, Video Rendering and Effects And choose from the drop down menu.**\n\n###Note: all media platforms recompress any footage you submit to them. It is best to render to the highest quality footage you can. Either increase your data rate for mp4 h264/5 or use a less lossy format such as mov Prores.\n\n##More Info\n\n**Note: Certain fonts do cause issues in AE.  If you are having problems like long render times or lagging on text animations try a different font as a stand in. Then replace the stand in font with the original choice for the final render, or use a different font entirely for the project**\n\n##Help\n\nIf you are having problems with After Effects this sub may be able to help. **But you do need to give as many details of the problem as possible and supply example links or screen shots of the issue, if possible.** While there are lots of experts on this sub nobody here is a mind reader. So **DETAILS** please.\n\n**Some problems are beyond the expertise of the members and contacting Adobe Support is a really good idea.**\n\nAdobe Support Help can be accessed via the After effects **Help** menu.  Direct link to Adobe support **https://helpx.adobe.com/support/after-effects.html?mv=product&mv2=ae** Be sure to use the chat feature at the bottom right of the page to get immediate help.\n\nThe Adobe site also has a help forum and can be accessed in the help menu at the top of the screen under **HELP**  with many other links also available.\n\n##Other Resources\n\n**User Guide**\n\nLink to AE User Guide https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/user-guide.html\n\n\n##Expressions\n\nLearn a few basic expressions as they will save you a ton of work. Example: LoopOut(); wiggle(); Random(); and linear(); will save you so much work instead of trying to keyframe everything.\n\nThis is more advanced subject matter but I will include it. Link to AE Expressions Guide https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language-reference.html \n\nExpressions run on javascript coding with a few minor caveats.  AE does not store values in memory and relies on CTI time for advancing calculations.\n\nThe w3school is an excellent source of learning javascript, its free and in depth resource based on website js https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp There are many youtube videos as well.\n\n##Scripting\n\nScripts are also written in javascript and are much more complicated to learn and have lesser educational resources available.  \n\nThe tool to use for this is Microsoft Visual Studio, its free https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\n\nScripting Guide https://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/\n\nThis guys youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@NTProductions\n\n\n##General Good Advise\n\n**Never update in the middle of a project.**\n\nLatest versions of AE always have bugs to work out; wait a few months before updating to latest version. \n\nDo not be afraid to try an effect, it will not ruin the source footage (unless you save a render to the original file(thus over writing it); so do not do that).\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for AE, there is so, so, so much more. Everything covered here can be searched for; tuts and more info is available in the sub's side bar. Practice your Google Foo often.\n\n While there are plugins and scripts to do many tasks it is important to learn how to do things natively in AE; otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure when a problem comes up that a plugin cannot handle.\n\n##ADDITIONALLY:\n\nLearn other software to support your AE projects such as:\n\n**Animate** or other animation software.\n\n**Illustrator** or other vector graphics software.\n\n**Photoshop** or other raster image editng software.\n\n**Premiere** or other editing software(NLE's).\n\n**Learn 3d software like blender, Maya, 3ds Max, C4d full version, or even Houdini. While C4D lite is included in AE it is pretty limited.**\n\nAlso learn about audio editing and mastering using a DAW (Digital Audio workstation). For Adobe that is **Audition** but there are many others out there some less complicated and others much more complicated. As example Ableton Live.\n\nAlso, if you are capable and inclined, learn Javascript as that in itself can save days of work by using expressions in places that keyframeing would be next to impossible( JS also opens up possibilities in web page animation and coding). \n\nIf anybody has anything to add please leave a comment.\n\nEdit  added more stuff concerning compositions,  Thanks every one for participating.\n\nEdit 2 Added more stuff concerning hotkeys and resources. The response has been great and those that have contributed here need to be thanked.",

            "Let me be the first to say, whoa.",
            "\u201cName your layers\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not my mother\u2026../stomps away\n\n(Really kids, name your layers, you don\u2019t want to be like me and open a project from a year ago and tell yourself you\u2019re a fucking idiot, then continue to not name your layers)\n\nNo but seriously, absolutely fantastic writeup. There is so much valuable info here for new comers and many veterans alike.",
            "A great start. A few additions:\n\nI'd add **S** for Scale to your hotkey list. I teach my students the mnemonic device PARTS - position, anchor, rotation, transparency, scale.\n\nAlso - **U** to reveal all keyframes. **UU** to reveal all edited parameters.\n\nI think it helps to understand the hierarchy of how stuff gets done in After Effects. Everything is a layer. Layers can have keyframes, effects, masks, mattes\u2014that'll probably get you 90% of the way there. Want to identify what effect is being used? If pixels are being moved around, check the distortion category. If colors are changing, check the color correction category, etc.\n\nPrecomposing fixes lots of problems. Want one effect applied to two layers? Make those two layers into one layer by precomping.\n\nI'd also add a reminder to set your anchor point before animating\u2014particularly if an object is changing both position and rotation/scale. If you do position keyframes, then decide you want your anchor point to be somewhere else, it will cause problems. \n\nFinally, if this is actually going to be a sticky on the sub, can we not use the sentence \"like a fat kid in a candy store\"? I'm not here to get into a discussion on fat shaming and body politics, but I'm sure as creatives we can come up with something better.",
            "Not sure if reddit has some sort of sticky function. But this should be a sticky. I think you covered at least 75% of the questions that are asked here regularly.\n\nEspecially people using .mp4 footage in their project. I must have seen about 50 topics about that now.",
            "Great document! This will help people avoid common pitfalls. If i may make a recommendation, i would add a link to the Expression Reference page as it is an invaluable resource if you are writing or learning expressions https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language-reference.html",
            "Great post - I will say as someone with 20 years experience, I DO use after effects like an editing application when I\u2019m making an explainer video or self contained project.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re editing repetitive or long form content, a feature, episodic stuff,  yes that best done in an editing app. \n\nI get that it may not be best practice but having the overall video on a single timeline with precomps of effects scenes is a great way to keep it all unified and not have to bounce between different apps.  \n\nIf my cpu works a little harder I\u2019m ok with that.",
            "With your project do nots,\nWhy use a 2 step render. I've never had issues going AE to media encoder?",
            "I have three questions:\n\n1. Why is Media Encoder so much slower? Is there no option to make it run better?\n2. I have heard rumors, that Media Encoder runs much better, if After Effects is still running in the background. Testing this, it has seemed true to me, although I could not figure out why. Why is this?\n3. Which codec would you recommend to pre-render precomps that need to have alpha. So far, I used the Apple Pro Res 4444 one. But is that not a good one?\n\n  \nTechnically a fourth question... but this one's more hypothetical, I don't expect an Answer:\n\nI render many videos daily. So far, my workflow has been, so send them all to Media Encoder individually. I might end up saving a couple of minutes every day if I render them all out from within their own project, but this means I can't just stack 10 Renders from different Projects and go on break while they render out. Is there a smarter way to do that?",
            "This is great! Definitely some good info here. Thanks for sharing",

            "Hey guys, I need to make a looping animation of snowflakes (simple, cartoonish design, so nothing realistic, around 10 flakes in frame at the same time, spaced out) falling throughout a presentation (around 3 mins so a long time). All the tutorials I find use Particle which I'm not very familiar with and also is way too complex of an effect for what I need here. But the thing is I can't wrap my head around the 'perfect loop' concept and was wondering what scripts (other than LoopOut) I can use or what sort of math is needed. I tried animating the perfect natural motion manually, yet because there is no 'end' to the motion inside the precomp (other snowflakes keep appearing into frame), the LoopOut begins from the top abruptly. I hope I explained it well enough, and I know it's clearly a logical issue that would be resolved with some brain power but let's say I'm more of a creative than a theorist. Pleaaase help!",

            "So, I've been trying to follow a Tutorial for a simple animated Steam BG in AE.\n\nNow at around 9:52 (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvkjqE-8FW4) They go to File>Export>Save as Legacy Web File\n\nI do not have this option on my AE. I can only export to Adobe Premiere, Cinema 4D, Adobe Media Encore or add it to the render list.\n\nIn the video they have a LOT more options to export, I was wondering if this might be a settings thing? I recall I had a similar issue in Photoshop, and it was solved by activating a setting for legacy file formats. Sadly, I couldn't find a similar solution for AE yet, so that's why I'm asking for help!\n\nHow do i export my project in the same format? I use AE2022. Thanks for your time!",
            "Is there any script or trick to change the composition size of MANY compositions at the same time inside the Project Panel?\n\nI have a 9x16 video, and I have to convert it to 1x1, and I have a lot of compositions to change one by one... that's why I'm asking..."

Copy and paste the following expression:\n\nwiggle(3,15*effect.(\"Slider Control\")(\"Slider\"))\n\nThe first number is the frequency, which determines how fast the shake moves. The second number is the amplitude, which determines how much it moves. Adjust these values to your taste.

(the blending you did helped, but his skin and makeup aren't even the same color.\n\nAlso, costume did a pretty good job.  Strawberry looks good.",
            "Hey, looking good! Hope the info you got from the previous thread helped.  \nAnd yes, I agree with u/funky_grandma   The colour difference between face and prosthetic could use a tweak.   \nYou might be able to use something like 'Vranos Composite Brush' to select the colours, generate a matte, and then desaturate and re-tint it all the same red.... or just some lumetri to taste.",

You may also need to do some minor color correction because they didn't even match it.\n\nAlso, did wardrobe not have an iron or steamer?? What's with his shirt. Please tell me this is just a test shot and not the actual spot? Production design didn't seem concerned about the posters? Your work is good, but so many things about this project seem sketchy to me LOL",

I you've got Mocha Pro and the PowerMesh tool at your disposal, you should be able to fix that though and literally just Photoshop a frame and apply that to the motion and stretching of his face. You'd even be able to add those dimensional divots on moving parts like his cheeks!"
