            "if your previous version also was from DODI you shouldn't need to do anything. however if you get failed to load / corrupted this is what i did: \n\n1. find save (appdata/roaming/eldenring/)\n(there should be only one folder with ur saves. if there are multiple then find wich one is the one, probably the last one that was modified.)\n\n IF YOU OPEN THE DLC AND YOU'RE CHARACTERS ARE GONE: you probably downloaded a different repack. don't worry, same solution but extra steps :\n a.find saves folder. \n b.there should be two folders. Identify wich one is the dlc by creating a new character. \n c. leave the dlc saves alone and continue with step 4.\n d. for step six the source file is the ORIGINAL SAVE and destination file is the NEW DLC SAVE.\n e. for step 7 the steam id MUST BE THE NEW ONE, the folder WHERE THE DLC SAVES ARE. very important.\n\n2.COPY the saves to a new folder and delete the from the original.\n\n3. Open elden ring and create new character. \n\n4. INSTALL MODS: elden ring save transfer and save recover. might add links later.\n\n5. OPEN SAVE TRANSFER, Select the save you want to import: THIS IS THE ONE YOU COPIED. (source file)\n\n6. Select the save to where your characters will be copied: THIS IS THE NEW SAVE. Here you also select what characters you'll transfer. then just transfer and finish. (destination file)\n\n7. OPEN SAVE RECOVER: https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/295\n The steam id are the numbers from the folder where your saves are. Remember to run as admin. Select RUN and wait till the program finishes. \n\n8. DONE :D enjoy dlc.",
            "Here's what i did, backed my old save file and deleted it from appdata/roaming/elden ring , then I entered the game and made a new character, then used the elden ring save copier tool from github and copied my old savefile that i backed up into the new one i just made.",
