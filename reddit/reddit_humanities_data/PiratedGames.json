This happened 3 times (I'm losing my mind). \nAnywho, I tried to download a file manager/downloader to at least try and make the download faster but it's not really making a difference tbh. So I just stuck with the browser download. Any suggestion? (I'm new to installing pirated games on windows btw) my internet speed at the moment is about 5.2 Mbps but most of the time it's 2/3 Mbps if that's any help. ",
