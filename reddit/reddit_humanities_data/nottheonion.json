I told him I get 4 weeks as a federal employee and he was like, isn't that normal? No, I get a crazy amount of vacation time compared to the average American",

            "It looks like the feeling is that you (have to) take vacation in big chunks like at least a week at a time and make it an event. Don\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason, take vacation days one day at a time like a Friday or Monday and make long weekends over the summer. You don\u2019t have to take a big trip, you get a decent break, and not much to catch up on when you get back.",
            "Man, I work for a US company in Europe and work very closely with the equivalent US teams. With some of them I talk casually and I mentioned how crazy it is when I watch them take ONE week as their main holidays throughout the year and then a \u201clong\u201d weekend here and there. Absolutely insane.  \nThe more insane part is how the company there switched to no vacation limit and they still take a week only.  \nI really really really love my US ppl because they are all sweet and kind souls but damn that just seems brainwashed.",
            ">Meanwhile, Americans tend to take vacation days in chunks. Only 5% of us take at least one day off a month compared to 32% of Japanese people.\n\nThis is the key point. Americans make going on vacation an event, instead of just using up days for many long weekends over the course of the year, which likely contributes to why they don\u2019t use vacation days as extended family vacations can be costly and stressful. \n\nWe need to recondition ourselves to not feel\nlike a vacation has to be whole National Lampoon\u2019s adventure, and just take more extended weekends to actually enjoy ourselves and not feel like needing a vacation from the vacation when it\u2019s done."
