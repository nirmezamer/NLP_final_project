            "Rural towns force you to make life decisions that lead towards owning a home. There are not enough employers that pay minimum wage to support apartment complexes. Cities can have tens of thousands of minimum wage employees in the service industry such as retail, coffee shops, fast food, restaurants, etc.  In rural communities, there might be a gas station, grocery store, and a few other miscellaneous shops. These would be staffed by the town's teenagers and small business owners. The options for a young adult in a rural community are:\n\n1. Move to a city for college\n2. Join the military/CAL FIRE/PG&E/Caltrans/etc.\n3. Learn a trade (electrician, plumbing, heavy equipment, etc.)\n\nThese options lead to a situation where a young adult can purchase a home in the low $300,000's. If the young adult does not succeed, life dictates that they would have to move to the city and work in the service industry, which would lead to them not be counting as a \"rural homeowner\".\n\nI moved to a rural town in the Sierras. Everyone in my age group that I interact with has a degree. In the post-Covid world and the proliferation of remote work, many are not even having to commute back to the nearest city for the higher-paying professional careers now.\n\nThere are pros and cons to life in a rural area. We lose out on ease of access to amenities, health care, colleges, and services (Both public and private). \n\nHowever, rural communities tend to have a better \"Sense of Community\", more volunteerism, larger lots, more outdoor recreation opportunities, lower crime, less pollution, and lower cost of living."

I dont usually cheer my government this hard, but this was so badly needed. In the end, this will be very bad for predatory lenders especially, and I am really hoping this will help bring down the average new car payment from $750 as students learn what interest is and how it works. Just hopping over to the car buying, and credit reddits here, so so so many people haven't the slightest clue what the 19.99% apr means on their $70,000 Ford F250 Fx4 OffRoad auto loan.",

            "Just another example of California being one of the few states that actually operates like an entity which exists to ELEVATE its citizens and not just extract value out of them. Proud to live here.",
            "I used to be a HS math teacher in California. I always included a section on finances for my general math classes, which were for students who couldn't pass the harder classes (algebra, etc.) Unfortunately there was zero flexibility to include such a unit in the other math courses. In my class I told students that I would teach them how to become millionaires if they wanted to learn it, and of course they did. So first they had to get proficient at basic arithmetic and learn percentages and compound interest. I always made mastery required, we didn't move on until they knew how to add, subtract, multiply and divide while numbers, fractions and decimals. \n\nAt that point, once they all had those skills, I taught two units: financial literacy and nutrition literacy. They learned about \"the magic of compound interest\" and managing budgets, and how to read nutrition labels, calculate calories, etc. These were taught using simulations where they made choices, and practical examples such as outside speakers telling their own rags to riches stories, nutritionists who brought in a fast food meal and a whole food healthy meal and helped students see how they compared. \n\nOver the years I had many angry parents saying that I shouldn't stress out students by making them participate in these lessons, but also many students who came in years after high school to profusely thank me for teaching them these basics. \n\nI've also helped students after high school, as they call me and ask for financial advice, and I provide it. I've had several that became millionaires, one in his 30's who (as a gardener) bought several homes outright and makes really high incomes. \n\nI always advocated for a course on financial literacy, but there was never \"room\" in the curriculum for this. It's wonderful that it is happening now. \n\nBut now, how about nutrition also being required?",
            "First good move that our government has made toward our educational system",

            "Solid move.",
            "Excellent. Most of us got some kind of financial literacy education in school, but it was likely brief, spread across different grades and classes, and not a singular focused curriculum.\u00a0\n\nHell mine was mainly some guy from BankOne that came into our 9th grade class for one day, talked about checking & savings accounts, and handed out toothpaste tube rollers with their bank logo and his business card. We then had to do the whole monthly living expenses vs budget project for a couple weeks, and that was it.\u00a0\n\nNot exactly thorough.\u00a0"

Clearing camps was possible but came with thorny legal issues.\n\nI am not in favor of arrest or fines, and if they refuse to accept some housing that is created for them, there may not be an alternative. It feels like a lot of these projects fail because the homeless can camp where they want. I get why they do that. I was homeless and love nothing more than my autonomy.

Rehabilitate those we can and develop long-term solutions for those we can't. Train counselors, give more able residents jobs in kitchen and laundry. We can do better.
