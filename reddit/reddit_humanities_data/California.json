            "Im a rural millennial homeowner. I underestimated just how much more Id be spending on vehicle expenses and fuel out here. I moved from Oakland to Tuolumne county and my mortgage is half what my old rent was but my fuel expenses eat up whatever savings there were. Im a tradesman and feel like I more or less live in my truck. \n\nI would argue that rural living is not cheaper but the quality of life is much better.",

            "I too have thought about moving to Victorville since I do have job opportunities out there, the only negative is I would live in Victorville.",
            "Does this writer not know the reason why people don't want to live rural?  And that includes sacrificing home ownership."

            "I really think a lot more need to be evaluated to find out if they have mental illness and needs to be in facilities. When I was homeless and staying in a shelter, the people Id see are just regular people youd see every day and wouldnt notice theyre actually homeless. Many of these people had jobs and families to take care of. They did their best to get back on their feet. \n\nSome dont want help and do actually prefer the life of living on the street.",
            "When we pushed for the Tuff shed project in Oakland, one of the chief problems was getting the homeless to move into them. Clearing camps was possible but came with thorny legal issues.\n\nI am not in favor of arrest or fines, and if they refuse to accept some housing that is created for them, there may not be an alternative. It feels like a lot of these projects fail because the homeless can camp where they want. I get why they do that. I was homeless and love nothing more than my autonomy.  But should we all live in filth?",
            "I think there need to be institutions that aren't prisons. Get outside what we know. Create and bankroll a new type of facility for these situations. We're already spending a lot of money, and the situation isn't improving. Let's spend the money in a more directed and productive manner with better oversight. Rehabilitate those we can and develop long-term solutions for those we can't. Train counselors, give more able residents jobs in kitchen and laundry. We can do better. But first, we have to acknowledge that unwanted intervention is just necessary in some cases.",
            "Cities should still provide a place to go  but this will help them force people to go.",
            "Well it says cities CAN. But if they dont want to they dont have to. I dont think it will affect any big city in California.",

            "Yes, affordable housing is needed, but for the other 80% of the homeless, we need mental healthcare.  Most of the homeless have serious untreated, unmanaged mental illness exacerbated by drug addiction and alcoholism.",
