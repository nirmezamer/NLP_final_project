            "For the first story, I can completely understand how hard it is to show scars. Especially ones linked to trauma. It's not  exactly the same, but I have severe scarring on my shoulders/back, and people are unbelievably cruel about them. It took me a lot to start wearing clothing that showed that part of me again, but I cannot handle heat and live in a very hot city, so I finally caved. Intense therapy helped as well, but even then it produced a lot of anxiety every time I went out showing my shoulders/back in public. One of the first times I went in public with them showing, I went to the zoo, and at the tiger exhibit one mom went on and on to her little daughter about how it looked like I was a victim of a tiger attack, how ugly the scars were. Before they were fully healed, so before all the therapy and when I would still cover them up, my dad pulled my shirt down my shoulders to show a dog trainer we were interviewing with, nearly costing me my chance to get a service dog I desperately needed because of concern about the safety of the home the dog would be going to. I used to love swimming, but I still have trouble going into a pool if there are others there. So, long story short, I understand the OP's partner being easily triggered by it, and that's without the connection to his mom passing. I couldn't imagine having that on top of everything else. Even the people who aren't cruel will ask about scars, never mind that you might be uncomfortable or upset by talking about them. In that case it's not cruelty, more obliviousness and ignorance, but it is still a nasty thing to get hit with. I don't know if I'm making any sense, but yeah.... OP's partner is totally justified in his feelings, but I hope he gets some help to work through it. Maybe his first therapist didn't click, and that's why it didn't help. It's a lot like finding the right puzzle piece, I went through soooo many therapists before I found one that I actually made progress with.",

Her brother wasn't aware of her breaking up and moving in, etc. At least he didn't know the full situation. Comments told her she was delulu because army PTSD isn't exactly something you can fix with a hug and a smile.",
            "Then maybe you should have more sense to make sure the stories you plan on covering are still active before you start recording the episode. It's baffling on why and how you just blindly pick the most provocative sounding titles to read but then act so shocked when you finally see ON THE RECORDING that the post was deleted and now you're having to piece it together from random comments.",

She and her husband and baby get a separate airbnb nearby and then she spends part of the time at the bachelorette and part of time with her baby at their airbnb. \n\nBeing away from a young baby is really difficult, both emotionally but also practically, and also feeling excluded as a new mom sucks.

Is she expecting someone to stay back with her or for you all to stay so she can somewhat join in - but at a minimum so as not to wake baby?\n\nIs the person sharing her room OK with it? \n\nThe bride might be ok with it and it is her weekend, but that only goes so far when everyone else has also spent time, money and effort to attend to potentially have plans scrapped and money wasted.\n\nNTA, I would say the exact same thing as you.

Our daughter 19 months had a temperature last night and seems to have a cold. She\u2019s very sniffly and has a temperature and when our daughter is unwell she wants to be held near constantly by myself and is very whingey and upsets easily (understandably so). With this is mind my husband suggested that we should cancel dinner tonight if she is still unwell by midday. I agreed, I think it is unwise to have people around if she isn\u2019t herself, as she needs our attention and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to potentially let our guests catch a cold/would be unfair to our daughter to not put her first and be available 100% to care for her. However, my husband then said, within seconds of suggesting we cancel the dinner.\n\n\u2018If we are postponing dinner, and obviously I\u2019m not pushing that. Fitstop has a trivia night on that I\u2019d like to go to instead\u2018\n\nMy logic is, if our daughter is unwell enough for us to cancel dinner with friends, and a handful as he knows, he shouldn\u2019t be making other plans to go out to trivia with his fitness group and leave me home alone with a sick child?\n\nHe should be staying home with us and helping out right?\n\nI said I would prefer if he stayed home and helped. He said he would come home early and help tidy the house clean and feed her and then go out for the evening, but I said that wasn\u2019t the point, it was more that I would prefer he be home and help out?\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been to one of his fitness groups socials since December last year due to his own work commitments, which I sympathise with. But he works out 2-4 nights a week and goes to a trading session most a unday mornings with them, which I understand isn\u2019t a social but he still gets to see them there.\n\nI\u2019m currently 6 weeks pregnant and going through significant fatigue, I\u2019m studying to be a nurse and the past 2 weeks I\u2019ve been on hospital placement shift working and I\u2019m really burnt out, I feel like if wasn\u2019t experiencing pregnancy fatigue, or had a really hard week I would maybe be okay with it, but my husband thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking him to stay home and says I\u2019m delusional for thinking he isn\u2019t putting me first by going out instead of staying home.\n\nSo I\u2019m asking reddit to provide an opinion on this situation, am I being delusional by feeling that my husband should stay home?\n",

If anyone kisses her ANYWHERE, I immediately whip my DIY soap kit out and clean her right up. I don't kiss her on the face at all myself, only on her little body or the back of her head. You're right, germs are easily passed through the mouth, and something that won't harm a big kid or an adult could be very serious for a baby. This isn't forever, you aren't going to follow your baby around all his life demanding nobody kiss him. It's just for a few months.\n\nThat is YOUR baby, and if your baby gets sick, you're the one who will have to deal with that, not them. I have to remind people of this constantly. I just had a talk with a family member who wanted me to have my baby outside on the porch on a 100-degree day with an air quality warning, in a yard that was filled with mosquitoes. She kept saying \"babies need fresh air.\" Okay and when my baby gets a heat rash and is up crying all night, can I call you to come over? If she's screaming because she has itchy bug bites, are you going to be tired at work tomorrow because you were up all night? No. I am, and I'm staying in the house with the AC.",
            "Coming from a mom who had a baby hospitalized from RSV, I\u2019m gonna put this as nicely as possible. If people can\u2019t/wont listen to the rules you put in place for the health of YOUR baby, they don\u2019t need to meet him.",
            "No, you're not wrong\n\nBabies have underdeveloped immune systems and you should absolutely forbid everyone from kissing your baby. \n\nEven kissing the top of the head is a No-No. There are tons of videos online explaining this, send it to everyone make your husband watch it so he can back you up. You're not crazy.\n\nKissing babies can sometimes cause lifelong problems such as HSV-1 and in worse case be fatal. That's not meant to scare you. You need to get yourself and everyone around you educated about this so you can make informed decisions.",
            "You are not wrong. Stand your ground. Protect your baby. Your baby, your rules and you can tell anyone who argues with you just that and end the conversation.",
            "Tell everyone, they must wear masks or no holding the baby.\n\nTell cousin, they don't understand that your baby was in NICU and no one will get to give a little kiss. Protect your baby!",
            "Not wrong at all. My son was born at 25 weeks, 90 days in the NICU. We did the same and made sure people sanitized before holding."
