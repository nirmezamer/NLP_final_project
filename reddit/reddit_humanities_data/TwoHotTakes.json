            "Theres a story that Shane from Smosh covered a while back, but it only had two updates at the time yall, that story went WILD! A total of EIGHT updates on that post, and it was a rollercoaster that blasted through several layers of reality and into the realm of fiction, except Im pretty sure humans cant conceive such splendor on their own without the help of several chaos demons! This could honestly be an episode all on its own.\n\nAITA for jumping out of the way when my niece and nephew tried to push me into a pool, resulting in them falling in?",

            "Story 1: I was raised super religiously/in a cult. My parents once threw me a fruits of the spirit themed carnival in our back yard. Silly little games like fishing plastic fish with numbers out of the kiddie pool or doing trust falls all themed around the fruits of the spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). We actually ended up being asked to bring it to several church picnic type events for the next 3 years. Other years we just didnt have a theme other than party or a color or an animal (like zebra) or a culture (Hawaiian luau for example but it was very white washed down to just grass skirts and leis and fake poi). My family was slightly more liberal than other families I knew so I once had a Barbie themed partybut several of my friends declined to attend that one because so many parents thought Barbie was evil too. I did attend several veggie tales themed parties and it was the primary entertainment for a lot of us.",
            "Story 1: I was raised Mormon and while my parents weren't at all strict about what I watched, the same could not be said for my friends. \nI knew one guy in school who had never seen a Disney movie. He watched church shows (Prince of Egypt for example) Golden Age musicals (Music Man) and A LOT of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. For reading time he'd just read scriptures. His little brother once told me all he wanted was to watch a Disney movie. Honestly it was just sad to witness. The oldest brother was very on board with all of it but the second oldest definitely had some \"rebellious tendencies\" (aka wanted to see Frozen) I never went to a birthday party for anyone in that family so I don't know what theming they might have had. But they also had ten kids so they maybe couldn't afford birthday parties",

I have been begging them to go to the beach since last summer. \n\nMy two best friends both have five year-old boys. I don\u2019t have any children. \n\nMy friend Michelle said she probably won\u2019t go to the beach that much this summer so she wants to make it a family event and is including her son and husband, then she suggested our other friend Rachel in the group chat, should also bring her son and her husband. I was OK with that. I love them and I love their children so it was really no problem to me even though I would be a fifth wheel. \n\nWell, Rachel\u2019s husband and me do not get along. He is emotionally abusive. Plus a cheater and a liar. Because he knows that I feel this way about him in return he hates my guts. He has tried to isolate Rachel for me for a long time, but thankfully, she has been strong enough to stay friends with me despite it all. \n\nAfter said plans were made our friend Michelle reached out to me and asked if I would mind if we rescheduled the trip to next week just the girls no kids and I said I wasn\u2019t available the other weekend. Why did you want to change it? and she said because Rachel\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t want to go if  I\u2019m there. So I said \u201cwell isn\u2019t that his problem?\u201d In which Michelle responds \u201cwell no offense, but we have kids who wanna play together and you don\u2019t so unfortunately it comes down to the fact that if he doesn\u2019t go, his kid doesn\u2019t go and that ruins the boys beach day.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to my best to be mature about this but did I really just get kicked out of my own plans to accommodate my friends abusive husband?

Sadly, you seem to be the only one he can't manipulate which is why to him you are enemy # 1.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, bare with me it's 3am and I'm tired of overthinking this stupid situation.\nSo my husband (M.22) and myself (F.22) were invited to denver comic con by my friends Nikki (F.26) and Braxton (M.44) as well as nikkis mom (F.49). We had been saving up for the better part of a year just to make sure we could afford to go and had finally been able to pull together enough cash for tickets, some for a hotel and food while we were there. This last month Nikki offered to let us stay with her and everyone else in the hotel room that they booked in August of 2023 (relevant later). My husband and I agreed since we would be sleeping on the couches and we're expecting to pay like $50 each. Two days ago she called me and asked me if we wanted to pay her before the trip for this hotel room I asked how much we owe her and she said $450 I immediately knew we couldn't afford that and started asking a whole bunch of questions. She said it was $225 for each of us, (we are going to sleep there that is it), she said it was our portion of the hotel bill split 5 ways between everyone else. I told her there was no way we could afford that and she offered to pay what we couldn't but she expected us to pay her back. I told her thank you but we won't be able to due to us living paycheck to paycheck while trying to get a house when our lease is up. After asking a whole bunch more questions she told me when they booked the hotel we hadn't even been invited yet, and they booked an 8 person hotel suite for the three of them. This suite has 3 bedrooms and a living room, they each get their own rooms while we get the couch but are paying the same amount? It kinda pissed me off so I've been stewing and told her no way in hell am I paying $450 to sleep on a couch for 10 hours and not be there anymore than that. \n\nSo AITAH? If you need more info let me know this is the gist of it tbh. Also we leave July 3rd and won't be back til July 7th. Plz help",

Also the maths seems off so does everyone pay $225 to have their own room while you and your husband spend $450 to share a couch? You would literally be subsidising there holiday and for them to have a bedroom. \n\nYou also say youre only there for 10 hours? So how many nights are you planning on spending at the hotel? Just get your own hotel room or Airbnb as they are being ridiculous and theirs no point you trying to work this out with them since they seem to not have any common sense.",

            "So your share is $450 and their share is $675. You didnt say for how many nights. So heres what I do. Option #1 - tell your friend ok but you need one of the 3 bedrooms and can only pay X, but will pay her back the rest later (take 3 years) OR Option #2 - Youll pay her $50 a night to crash on the couch for both of you."
