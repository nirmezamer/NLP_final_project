            "The Playstation emulation news is so bs to me, why would a anti-consumer company do a pro-consumer thing and put their best games on ps5 with no streaming for free lol. They're gonna Sony the shit up like they always do",
            "reasonably sure. NateDrake/Nate the Hate says it's real and finished. The person that leaked photos of Engage before it was announced says it's real. There's a gap in codenames between Three Houses (codenamed Iron17) and Engage (codenamed Iron19) that isn't accounted for by Three Hopes (codenamed Seasons)\n\nWorth keeping in mind the last FE remake released on 3DS a month *after* the Switch came out (in Japan; it took another month after that for the game to reach North America/Europe/Australia). With Nintendo's fall being reasonably full without a FE4 remake and the direct only dating games as far as January, plus Engage being only a year and a half old at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they have a September direct that announces the FE4 remake for spring of next year and it ends up being cross-gen or even just \"Switch 1 only, but playable on Switch 2 via back-compact)",

            "Wouldnt mind if xCloud gone if we get GFN integration instead",
            "This is exciting, I'm enjoying game streaming more and more lately. It will never be as good as running it natively on your machine, but I've been shocked at how low the latency has been and how playable games are. Granted, I have my consoles hardwired to my router and my internet is pretty solid (I'm in Canada). \n\nI've even been playing inFAMOUS on PS3 through the PS Plus game streaming and that too is surprisingly seamless. Not perfect, but better than nothing",
            "I mean, Xbox has Microsoft Edge. You can play games via GeForce Now. I used it to transfer my PC Witcher 3 saves to Xbox a year ago or so.",
            "So i guess that rumor of Xbox going full multiplatform device with Steam integration is slowly happening",
            "This is awesome Im becoming a fan of the direction Xbox is going give the players choice. It seems they are opening the platform up as opposed to having a closed platform. Im surprised especially from the creators of windows. \n\nGreat news for consumers",
            "Didn't someone during the showcase after interview mention that this showcase was focused on games and that hardware etc would be talked about elsewhere so maybe this and the ABK stuff, new controller, any subscription changes etc"

It\u2019s understood that Avalon is nearly complete, but Activision is adamant to see a massive resurgence in players.

It seems battle royal thats more grounded ie Warzone & PUBG have such low standards outside of there branding atleast TLOU gameplay wouldve been better then PUBG & at the very least competed w COD twitchy gameplay. Who knows Im really surprised ND didnt also make a survival game giving the PVE & Faction nature of the TLOU universe that couldve also been good since Rust & DayZ have lower budget & more clunky lower standards"
