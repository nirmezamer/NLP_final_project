There were plans for a female protagonist, who would once again take part in an underground workers revolution. There would likely have been a range of factions, from predatory corporations to homegrown Martian communities, with whom you might have had to forge alliances to complete your objectives.\"\n* \"While the game was envisaged as a \"safe sequel\" with a familiar emphasis on wrecking buildings, members of the Project White team also wanted to create a more open-ended play experience - closer to an immersive sim, perhaps, with opportunities for stealthy infiltration and player disguises alongside vehicle customisation. There were pie-in-the-sky aspirations to create an extremely reactive setting with dynamic dialogue, in which characters would comment on your methods of completing quests.\"\n* The internal vote to greenlight the project was 50-50, so it was immediately cancelled and the Fishlabs leaders were told to \"lay almost everyone not attached to an active project off\"",

Runs really well on lower spec hardware like handheld PCs, too. Played most of the game on my ROG Ally through Game Pass some time last year. Really scratched my itch for a Star Fox \"All Range Mode\" style dogfighting game, and it had some really surprisingly interesting worldbuilding and writing.
