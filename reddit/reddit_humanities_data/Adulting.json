        "content": "  \n\nSo, you want to be a fucking successful adult. CONGRATS, I have written some how-to\u2019s for you so you can start to get your fucking shit together. \n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh0m1l/being_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult_part/)\n\n[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh3evn/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Adulting with Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh4lzh/how_to_adult_when_you_are_too_depressed_to/)\n\nHere are some fucking FAQ\u2019s on the parts I wrote so that you don\u2019t have to scroll through and upvote every single nice comment in the comment section on all of the parts. \n\nQ: Are there going to be more parts?\n\nA: Yeah probably. But I have a fucking life where I do things that aren\u2019t writing how-to\u2019s, so they will arrive whenever I am feeling generous enough to give advice and have the energy to write about said advice. \n\nQ: You should write a book.\n\nA: Thank you, I am. The book is in the works, basically it\u2019s a fucking 100-page rant where I talk about how to wash your balls. \n\nQ: How old are you? Are you a boy or a girl?\n\nA: I am an adult. I will not tell you my age because once I do you will suddenly have all these pre-conceived judgements about the quality of the advice I give. But here is a hint, I am older than 18 and younger than 50. I am a person. Take a guess on my gender and if you get it right Ill give you a fucking star. \n\nQ: Why can\u2019t you write normally?\n\nA: Because there are a bajillion fucking self-help books out there written normally, and there are like 5 that are written in a way that people fucking relate to and listen to. If cursing *turns you off* then good. I only want readers who can fucking read this shit with a boner 6 miles long. \n\nQ: I have a tip that you don\u2019t mention, can you add it to the article?\n\nA: Sure, if its actually fucking good. Send me a message with your advice that you think is good enough to make it, and I\u2019ll add it to the end of the article and credit you. \n\nQ: I run a podcast/YouTube channel/ blog, can I interview you or have you guest speak?\n\nA: Generally, yes. My time is precious, so if you want me to write something completely new for your shit its going to take a while and will probably cost you more than exposure. \n\nQ: What do you do when you aren\u2019t cussing people out on the internet?\n\nA: I own a business and am a stay at home parent. When I am not writing, I am packing orders, creating or listing new product, taking care of my son, or playing with my two dogs. I rarely have any down time.\n\nIf you have more questions you want answered or have an idea for an article you want me to write, send me a PM. I will decide if its cool enough for me to respond to it.",
