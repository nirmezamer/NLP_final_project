        "content": "  \n\nSo, you want to be a fucking successful adult. CONGRATS, I have written some how-to\u2019s for you so you can start to get your fucking shit together. \n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh0m1l/being_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult_part/)\n\n[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh3evn/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Adulting with Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh4lzh/how_to_adult_when_you_are_too_depressed_to/)\n\nHere are some fucking FAQ\u2019s on the parts I wrote so that you don\u2019t have to scroll through and upvote every single nice comment in the comment section on all of the parts. \n\nQ: Are there going to be more parts?\n\nA: Yeah probably. But I have a fucking life where I do things that aren\u2019t writing how-to\u2019s, so they will arrive whenever I am feeling generous enough to give advice and have the energy to write about said advice. \n\nQ: You should write a book.\n\nA: Thank you, I am. The book is in the works, basically it\u2019s a fucking 100-page rant where I talk about how to wash your balls. \n\nQ: How old are you? Are you a boy or a girl?\n\nA: I am an adult. I will not tell you my age because once I do you will suddenly have all these pre-conceived judgements about the quality of the advice I give. But here is a hint, I am older than 18 and younger than 50. I am a person. Take a guess on my gender and if you get it right Ill give you a fucking star. \n\nQ: Why can\u2019t you write normally?\n\nA: Because there are a bajillion fucking self-help books out there written normally, and there are like 5 that are written in a way that people fucking relate to and listen to. If cursing *turns you off* then good. I only want readers who can fucking read this shit with a boner 6 miles long. \n\nQ: I have a tip that you don\u2019t mention, can you add it to the article?\n\nA: Sure, if its actually fucking good. Send me a message with your advice that you think is good enough to make it, and I\u2019ll add it to the end of the article and credit you. \n\nQ: I run a podcast/YouTube channel/ blog, can I interview you or have you guest speak?\n\nA: Generally, yes. My time is precious, so if you want me to write something completely new for your shit its going to take a while and will probably cost you more than exposure. \n\nQ: What do you do when you aren\u2019t cussing people out on the internet?\n\nA: I own a business and am a stay at home parent. When I am not writing, I am packing orders, creating or listing new product, taking care of my son, or playing with my two dogs. I rarely have any down time.\n\nIf you have more questions you want answered or have an idea for an article you want me to write, send me a PM. I will decide if its cool enough for me to respond to it.",

            "I enjoyed reading this and the last part about adulting with depression made me cry. It seems so simple yet its the truth and I wish more poeple could not as in were willing to but I mean able to accept that advice as the true path to feeling better. There it seems some people have this blockage in their train of thought that we all need to be self sufficient and so does our mental health but the sheer fact of being able to accept outside help and knowng that you need it is a big part of helping yourself too. \n\nI feel for all those who can't get past themselve and see no future and I too have been there and its deep and dark and sometimes you may think you are out of there but certain situations can trigger the same emotions to come rolling back in an instant. \n\nOf course you could be upset, buy or obtain new stuff, and feel more complete in itself. So everything ties together...Litteraly as you drive it to your place to unload or figuratively as you try to put together the pieced to make the puzzle of happiness."

It\u2019s sad that we would rather tell people to get over themselves than just be kind. Why people give up so easily and choose to contribute to the negativity in the world is beyond me. It\u2019s so easy to be kind. Now we\u2019ve stooped to the level of those miserable people who make our days worse and we\u2019ve become miserable ourselves. \n\nIt\u2019s sad seeing once pure hearted kids turn out to be bullies.

But having a bad day doesn\u2019t mean you should make everyone have a bad day. It just really upsets me how people can be so heartless these days and go about their day knowing that they caused someone else pain. \n\nAll of the terrible things happening in this world have to do with us. We started it all. Human beings. Because somewhere along the way we lost our humanity and our ability to have a heart for people, if we even had those things in the first place. \n\nLife is such a scary thing, but the part that makes it cruel to me is how soulless, lifeless and heartless humans have become.",

            "Start contributing into a 401K right now if your job offers it. I cannot stress it enough to start immediately. Contribute however much you can afford but make sure to take full advantage of any company matching at the very least. Compound interest is going to set you up for life if you start now and keep at it. If your job doesn't have a retirement plan, open an IRA. You will thank yourself later.\n\nIf you are in your early 20s you might read this and think yeah yeah yeah I'll get to it eventually I've got plenty of time. I know this because that was me at the age of 22. I always remembered the advice but my dumb ass ignored it. I don't have many regrets at all, but that is one of them.\n\nAnd you do have plenty of time for sure, but if you start young and keep at it you WILL retire a millionaire. Hell you could hit a million or more before you turn 60 and retire early if you start now. You might earn 60K a year or 160K. It doesn't matter. You can retire a millionaire.\n\nEither way save what you can right now or you will regret it in the years ahead. This doesn't mean you have to live like a pauper either. Save what you can to continue living your life and you will be golden.\n\nEdit to add a very low end example. If you make 50K/yr and contribute just 10% total (including any company match) that would be $5,000 per year. With just a 5% rate of return starting at 25 years old you would retire at 67 with over 700K. It's recommended that you have 10-12x your annual salary at retirement. Even given these very low values, in this case you would likely be retiring with 14x your annual salary. You would be golden.\n\nAnd note in my example the person never receives a raise and never contributes more than 10% total per year. Also 5% returns is overall on the low end as well.
