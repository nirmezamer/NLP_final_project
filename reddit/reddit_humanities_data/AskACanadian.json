            "I wouldn't be concerned because you'll get all of that back anyways: the basic amount federally is $15k this year, so if you made under that amount, any and all taxes you paid will be paid back to you when you file.\n\nBut generally speaking, some employers will deduct slightly more for taxes than what is expected; when you file, you will report to the CRA that you paid $226 in federal taxes, they will see that you were supposed to only pay $202.95, so they will refund you $23.05 as tax overpayment. It allows for some calculation flexibility without the risk of the employee getting an unexpected tax credit owed. \n\nGeneral rule of thumb I've heard from a former payroll admin: as an employer, you rarely hear from your employees if they ended up getting a tax refund, but you'll be flooded with angry voicemails and emails about a tax bill due to underpayed taxes.",
            "They have to be considered eligible medical expenses, and the CRA has a whole list of what they deem eligible or not.\n\nFor expenses that are eligible, first you plug in the total costs of ELIGIBLE expenses, then you subtract from that the lesser of the following:\n\n1. 3% of your net income\n2. $2,635\n\nThe remaining amount is what you can claim for medical expenses. More info can be found [here, as well as the list of eligible expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html).\n\nEdit: if your expense doesn't show up for the CRA, its worth checking for provincial credits too as they might recognize it. An example is that the CRA doesn't accept gym memberships as medical expenses, but Newfoundland gives a tax credit for gym memberships.",

That's my big lesson driving up there - never assume the next gas station will be open, and plan accordingly. Top up when you get a chance. \n\nIf you're driving in the summer, bring bug spray by the gallon. If you're driving in the winter, bring cold weather gear.\n\nHelps to make sure that you can change a tire and have a full size spare. It's a long slow drive if you lose a tire and drive on a donut.\n\nIt's a gorgeous drive. I always say that every Canadian should hit the territories at least once.",
            "I have done the drive from Calgary to Hay River, NT numerous times in the last 4 years. \n\nThe biggest thing you\u2019ll have to plan for is knowing when and where to stop for gas and snowstorms. \n\nFrom Edmonton onwards, you have to stop in Slave Lake, Red Earth Creek, High Level, Indian Cabins and/or Enterprise (if they have the gas station open) and Fort Providence. There is no cell service on the road from Enterprise onwards; it\u2019s spotty, at best. It\u2019s doable in a day, but it\u2019s a long ass day. Your best bet would to split it and drive to High Level one day and then onward to Yellowknife.  If you have a heavy foot, the chances of running into a cop/RCMP on these highways is very small. But they are generally around the city/town areas, in my experience. \n\nAs for snowstorms, that shit is just unpredictable. I got stuck driving in one in winter 2020/21 and it was awful. Don\u2019t recommend. I ended up in the ditch just outside of High Level and ended up stopping for the night as a result. Otherwise, highways are generally clear on AB side. It may not be as clear once you get north of 60. Especially so if it\u2019s just snowed and the trucks haven\u2019t been out on the road. Having said this though, traffic is usually pretty minimal and you can drive in the middle if the sides of the roads are pulling you into the ditch. If you are doing this drive in late fall, look out for buffalo on the highway to Yellowknife.",
            "Not dangerous at all. The roads are just fine all the way through. I\u2019ve made the drive many times.\n\nIf you do the drive in the winter, you just have to take your time and be alert as you would anywhere else.",
            "If you are going then you will be doing it in the winter and the roads may not be the best.",
            "Don't plan on a drive in the summer to see the aurora north of the 60th parallel.  Autumn, maybe, but be prepared for poor driving conditions in the mountains of BC and in the north.  Just go prepared.",
            "That\u2019s a long fucking drive from Van. It\u2019s a long ass drive from Edmonton. Be prepared",
            "map it on google maps. people drive to Yellowknife everyday.  Prepare yourself for the trip and make sure you have a reliable vehicle, spare tire, supplies in case you have a breakdown on the way, and a cell phone with a way to charge it other than your car.",
            "It's not dangerous. But it's a long drive. Just plan ahead. Be sure to top up for gas in High Level, AB, no matter what. And winter tires  is a must.\n\nI do not recommend the route towards the Liard Trail.",
            "Also we\u2019ve had a lot of wildfires. Last year all of Yellowknife was evacuated due to threat of fire. Visibility on some stretches of highway was almost nil.\n\nCheck  https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current/ in the days before heading out."
