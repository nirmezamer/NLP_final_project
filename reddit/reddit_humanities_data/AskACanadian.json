            "I wouldn't be concerned because you'll get all of that back anyways: the basic amount federally is $15k this year, so if you made under that amount, any and all taxes you paid will be paid back to you when you file.\n\nBut generally speaking, some employers will deduct slightly more for taxes than what is expected; when you file, you will report to the CRA that you paid $226 in federal taxes, they will see that you were supposed to only pay $202.95, so they will refund you $23.05 as tax overpayment. It allows for some calculation flexibility without the risk of the employee getting an unexpected tax credit owed. \n\nGeneral rule of thumb I've heard from a former payroll admin: as an employer, you rarely hear from your employees if they ended up getting a tax refund, but you'll be flooded with angry voicemails and emails about a tax bill due to underpayed taxes.",

            "They have to be considered eligible medical expenses, and the CRA has a whole list of what they deem eligible or not.\n\nFor expenses that are eligible, first you plug in the total costs of ELIGIBLE expenses, then you subtract from that the lesser of the following:\n\n1. 3% of your net income\n2. $2,635\n\nThe remaining amount is what you can claim for medical expenses. More info can be found [here, as well as the list of eligible expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html).\n\nEdit: if your expense doesn't show up for the CRA, its worth checking for provincial credits too as they might recognize it. An example is that the CRA doesn't accept gym memberships as medical expenses, but Newfoundland gives a tax credit for gym memberships."
