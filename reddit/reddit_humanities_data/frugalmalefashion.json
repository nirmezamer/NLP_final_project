Join the discord [HERE](https://discord.gg/UszgYBqdJW)  \n\n\n Buy/Sell/Trade here at your own risk.\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1. Post a description that accurately describes what you are selling.\n2. Update your thread when something gets sold or is no longer available.\n3. Post item condition and any images of the item (if available). Be as descriptive as possible when posting an item for sale or trade.\n\n**Suspected vote manipulation/brigading will be reported to the reddit admins.**\n\nSuggestions:\n\n* 99% of us use Paypal to facilitate these transactions. Gifting is fine, but understand the limits and liabilities of sending an unprotected \"gift\" to a seller. You'll save a bit of $, but it does leave you exposed if there is a fraudulent seller. So far though, in almost a year of this reoccurring thread, I haven't heard of **any** fraudulent transactions. But just try to be smart about things.\n* Please try to evaluate the \"fair market value\" of your items. No use in overpricing things and having them not sell.\n* Feel free to ask for answers or pictures about an item you are interested in. A good seller will always be willing to answer you in a timely matter.\n* On the other hand, be a good buyer. Respond to the seller's communication, and be truthful about your intentions. Nothing is worse for a seller than answering a bunch of questions about fit and details, and then the potential buyer dropping off the map.",

Things like:\n\n* Neck Collar Ribbing: Why some neck collars will stay in shape much longer.\n* Neck Collar Tags: Why some neck tags stay flat against your neck while others would curl up and become scratchy. Also why some clothing tags are crispy white while others are muddy (it's not an artistic decision.)\n* Textile patterns: How manufacturers decide on pattern to make the best fits while wasting the least fabric.\n* Sewing: Bar tacks and other details to separate durable/drappable clothings from low-quality ones.",

The formula seems to be to make as much money off that rep as you can while lowering costs.\n\nI have a 20 yo pair of board shorts from Quicksilver I've worn about 4000 times (fave pair and I used to get paid to be in the water). Still look pretty good to this day. Bought a new pair last summer that wouldn't last me a season, still good, just no longer amazing quality.",
