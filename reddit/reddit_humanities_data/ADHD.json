Is it more fair to say that sufferers have stronger emotions than average, or is it that they have more trouble with controlling those emotions due to deficits in executive function. Or is it that these two theories can exist at the same time? Thanks in advance",

Just now, I received an email that I need to see her every month to get a refill with no exception. \n\nThe problem is that I could barely afford to see her every 3 months and every month is going to be almost impossible. Due to the absurd cost of insurance in the US, I feel like I am stuck. The only other thing I feel like I can do is beg or try to get off of the medication which seems unfair considering how much my life has turned around because of it. \n\nI am paying $100 just to have her say \"How is everything with the medication going?\" and then following up with scheduling an appointment to see her again. \n\n  \nHas anyone else experienced this?

            "Have you told your doctor that the cost of copays every month is an obstacle for you?\n\n>I am in Texas so I am not sure of what the law is for prescriptions.\n\nIt is absolutely legal for doctors to write a 90-day supply of controlled substance; they just can't give you any refills. But a lot of doctors *won't* do this because of concerns that they might be accused of overprescribing medication to people who will abuse it.",
            "If your doctor won\u2019t work with you on this, you may need to see another doctor. A possible compromise might be to email each month to answer the standard questions and get your prescription and go back to a visit every three months. The doctor may not agree, but it\u2019s worth asking.",
            "I\u2019m in Texas. I have to request my refill every month via email so it\u2019s in writing, but I see my dr. once a year. \n\nGranted, I\u2019m \u201cstable.\u201d My medication is stable. And I haven\u2019t had a med change in 5 years.",
            "Would your doctor allow a telehealth visit for this and if so, would your insurance cover that/would it be any cheaper for you? If not, I would ask about a referral to another doctor who is willing to continue providing you with your medication every three months. \n\nHow long have you been on the medication and have you ever had any problems with your med checks/drug tests? If it\u2019s been a few years and you\u2019ve had no issues, I would definitely bring this up and ask why the change.\n\nI went off my stimulants for years because my insurance at the time had me paying $30 copay for each visit, $25 copay for each drug test, and whatever the copay was for Adderall at that time\u2026 somewhere in the $25-$50 ballpark. I don\u2019t recommend quitting if you can afford it, because now a few years later, I found myself in a situation where I really need medication and am having to wait weeks for an appointment while I continue to struggle.",
            "I don't want to come across like a dick head, but I'd like clarification, in America you have to pay for just having a... like a check in? A hundred dollars? That sounds obscene. I knew the health care was overpriced and preyed upon by the insurance companies, but that's pure mental.",
            "I had a doctor order drug tests every month. He said it was for \"insurance reasons\". So why can I just call it in with my new doctor and haven't had to drug test since switching to her? \n\nI think some doctors get skeptical when it comes to controlled substances. I get that abuse is a real problem, but when someone is having an entire panic attack because they have to figure out how to leave work to take a drug test just to get the medication that allows them to function, it's gone beyond skepticism and into distrust.",
            "I'm in Canada and absolutely appalled to learn this is how it works in the US. My doctor prescribes for 12 months and if I don't need to see them by renewal time, my pharmacy sends a fax to the clinic requesting renewal and Dr sends new prescription for another. If I'm late requesting this and need my meds the same day, the pharmacists here are allowed to renew for a single month and they charge a fee but they wouldn't leave someone without their meds. I hope things change in your country, health system has got to be separated from profit.",
            "Sounds like a Money Grab.  Explain the $$$ situation to your Dr.    \nAsk her for suggestions. Ask her about stopping the medication.   \nSome stuff, you do NOT want to stop suddenly.",
            "This is extremely common. Dr's offices are all owned by large corporations who need to increase profits every year. Forcing people to pay for a visit every month will definitely bring in a ton of money.\nThey don't care if you suffer or die, only that you pay them so the executives can buy another overseas vacation home."

My family continue to check in on me and make me eat meals with them on a weekly basis, this helps me actually eat because alone I only do a meal a day.

            "You sound like you have a good perspective of what your up against and you are goal minded so you have the tools to succeed. One tip to get your focus and avoid distractions and procrastination: right before you want to start working on something important to your goals, pick a task you really  hate doing that is unrelated to your goal. Psychologically your brain will crave to switch over to the real task that\u2019s part of your path to the goal you are working toward. It works.",
            "what are you studying? Something related to web / app development? \n\ndon't even think about starting an agency, developing an app by yourself etc. right now.\nfirst: get yourself a \"normal\" job, enough so you can save money. \n\nideally: get yourself a remote job in a company that's based in a country taking refugees from your country. \n\nI'm from Germany, and if you get a good remote Job in the web dev/ app field in a bigger company (40 - 50 employees at least and the company needs to make a good amount of money), they might even help you and sometimes pay part of expenses for moving to Germany. It's quite a hassle and they are only willing if you are good in your niche or at least willing and smart (you only have to seem like it ; )\n\nin the meantime: contact help organisations, that will help you to officially get registered as refuge seeking (the personal circumstances of your household and being obliged to marry some stranger might even be enough reason)... and do this now! \n\ndon't waste time, dreaming of supporting your own business. \n\nSet your priorities first!\n\nWork for others, save money, get out of that place."
