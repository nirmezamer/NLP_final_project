Articles/Information AMA: I'm a clinical psychologist researcher who has studied ADHD for three decades. Ask me anything about the nature, diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.\n\nArticles/Information\n\nThe Internet is rife with misinformation about ADHD. I've tried to correct that by setting up curated evidence at [www.ADHDevidence.org](http://www.adhdevidence.org/). I'm here today to spread the evidence about ADHD by answering any questions you may have about the nature , treatment and diagnosis of ADHD.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* I provide information, not advice to individuals.

            "If you were writing the DSM-6, what would you add/remove/change about the diagnostic criteria for ADHD?",
            "Is there any research into menstruation cycle and adhd you can direct me to?",
            "Hi professor, I've always been curious about the emotional dysregulation aspect of ADHD. Is it more fair to say that sufferers have stronger emotions than average, or is it that they have more trouble with controlling those emotions due to deficits in executive function. Or is it that these two theories can exist at the same time? Thanks in advance",
            "Thanks everyone for all these questions. Very sorry that I do not have the time to answer them all.  I'll do my best to come back soon.",
            "What are your thoughts on Russell Barkley's theory of ADHD as a disorder of the 7 major executive functions (self-awareness, inhibition, non-verbal and verbal working memory, emotional self-regulation, self-motivation and planning & problem solving) that combine to provide for self-regulation? Has it stood up scientifically?",
            "What's a random, fun fact about ADHD you were surprised to find in your work/research?",
            "Are there any particular comorbidities associated with ADHD that you'd like to see more research into?",
            "Hello professor, I was wondering if there are any links between diet and ADHD.  Are there foods that make the parasympathetic nervous system weaker?  Caffeine seems to have a deleterious effect on mine personally.  I was diagnosed as a child and again recently as a 33 year old as inattentive ADHD.  We have come a long long way since my first diagnosis.  Never received any treatment until recently.  Treatment has changed my life for the better!  Thank you.",
            "What do you think is the most damaging piece of ADHD misinformation *within* the ADHD community, something widely believed by those who have it, not just those who don't really believe in or understand it anyway?"

I feel you.",
