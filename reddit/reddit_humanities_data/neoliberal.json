Last night millions of people were watching, hardly anybody is gonna see this rally. His team did absolute shit prep work sending him out there as exhausted as he was.",

I also want to see what happens when Trump is sentenced for 30+ felony convictions on July 11 (less than two weeks from today). If Trump goes to prison, even if only for a month, it's gonna be tough to run a campaign from behind bars and it's going to give time to use him as a punching bag. Even if he gets a fine and probation, it may still hurt him with undecideds. I think we need to be patient and give it a couple weeks.",
            "Wow, why the hell couldn't he have done that when he had millions of eyes on him at the debate, when it really mattered? A campaign rally isn't going to do shit to make up for a disaster of a debate that just confirmed for millions of people everything that is supposedly wrong with Biden. Jesus, it's even more frustrating seeing this, knowing that he fucking has it in him but just couldn't turn it on when it mattered. Fuck.",

            "Words cannot express how much I hate this shitty subreddit. \n\nBiden underperforms ONE night in comparison to Trump's empty, nonsensical babbling and already half of you are ready to write off his campaign as doomed. You all are utterly worthless and it sickens me how easily you let Republicans take over these narratives with ZERO pushback"
