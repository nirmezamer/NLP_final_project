        "content": "I'm split on this to the point I don't feel strongly either way, so I'm curious about others thoughts. My own thoughts:\n\nOne one hand, the increased loot and exp makes the grind easier to deal with for farming and leveling multiple characters. That said, once you have an m11 build, farming is strictly a hobbyish \"I wanna make this particular gear/build work,\" since you can already take on the hardest content.\n\nOn the other hand, I simply don't trust Gearbox to get the balancing right. I realize it's a daunting task, and they worked on it for quite awhile with a lot of patches and hotfixes, but ultimately by m10/11 too much gear is left behind or requires a lot of build tuning to be useful. As per modifiers, some I'm fine with, others suck. I don't feel like they add much fun. Had we gotten m11 but for every level of Mayhem, I'd likely feel differently about the mode as a campaign replay function. But we didn't.\n\nI genuinely feel like Arms Race was made into an \"Oh shit,\" button on account of messing Mayhem up. Because you can drop right into m11 Arms Race, grab yourself a Beskar and Plasma Rifle, and you're good to start m11 with pretty much any toon. Anyone who doesn't want to fuss climbing through Mayhem levels can bypass it with Arms Race.",

            "I think having some kind of progression like the OP levels could help, but I also don't want to replay a trial/proving ground over and over to get them. I also do not want to be required to replay the story again to get to max level. I'm not sure what the solution is, not something between what we got in 2 and 3. \n\nMy personal opinion, with absolutely no real insight, I bet we won't get mayhem levels in the same way we have them in 3. They probably know everyone only runs M11 for no modifiers, so they can justify not adding it in.",
            "Whatever they do, it needs to have less levels/chaos. Like max 5 levels. Each level increases enemy health, xp and world drop chance and No dumb forced modifiers.\n\nMaybe a modifier screen were you can turn modifiers on/off. Every level let's you turn on 1 more positive modifier (like lootsplotion) but also needs you to turn on 1 negative modifier (like buddy system or enemy health regen). It makes the game more customizable and fun.",
            "In a world that only OP Levels, Mayhem and Chaos Levels exist, I would chose Mayhem to return. But I think we will have a new system for BL4.",
            "I say keep it. But they have to make sure that there won't be a need for mayhem 3.0 in the future. I don't like how only some skills have mayhem scaling in 3. All skills should have proper mayhem scaling from the start.",
            "I kind of like the earlier version of mayhem where certain weapons had a buff. What I would do is just create random buffs for weapon types, elements, etc. And just get rid of negative effects. That way we can utilize different guns but you aren't forced to use anything. I also don't think we need 11 mayhem levels. Probably just 1 mayhem mode is fine. My problem with high level borderlands play is that it doesn't really become fun. Although its supposed to be a challenge I think keeping with the direction of many different builds, weapons, and weapon rarities being useful should ultimately be the goal.",
            "i'd rather have OP levels",
            "I like the mayhem mode, but I would like to see three full-skill trees instead of 2 and a half in BL4.",
            "No, I would like a new system.\n\nMayhem did somethings really right, but the modifiers were terrible.  It was so bad it was game ruining for many people.",
            "Nah OP levels got it mostly right the first time, gearbox should learn to nerf overpowered skills rather than inflate difficulty scale values",
            "Fuck no. Just give me a proper new game+."
