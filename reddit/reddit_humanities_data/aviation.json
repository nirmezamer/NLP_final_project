        "content": "The Hughes H-1 Racer, designed and built by Howard Hughes, is often regarded as one of the most beautiful planes ever built. This aircraft, also known as the H-1, was a significant achievement in aviation history and played a pivotal role in setting world speed records.\n\nHoward Hughes, a renowned aviator and entrepreneur, was deeply involved in the development of the H-1 Racer. The aircraft was designed to be the fastest landplane in the world, and on September 13, 1935, Hughes achieved this design goal by flying the H-1 to a new world speed record of 352.322 mph. The H-1 Racer was characterized by its sleek and streamlined design, with wings that fair into the fuselage with a smooth and gracious curve, creating a visually striking and aerodynamically efficient aircraft.\n\nThe H-1 Racer was a testament to Hughes' passion for aviation and his pursuit of pushing the boundaries of speed and performance in aircraft design. The aircraft's significance is underscored by its association with Howard Hughes, a prominent figure in aviation history, and its contribution to advancing aeronautical engineering and speed capabilities during its era.\n\nThe legacy of the Hughes H-1 Racer continues to captivate aviation enthusiasts and historians, serving as a symbol of innovation, speed, and the pursuit of excellence in aircraft design.",

SWA4805 was flying from Portland to Baltimore early Tuesday morning. The airport Air Traffic Control tower was closed at the time because they do not open until 5:45 AM. Portland has to runways that intersect 18/36 and runway 11/29. Runway 11/29 was NOTAM\u2019d closed for maintenance until 5:45 AM. When the tower is closed, aircraft self announce on the tower frequency and this is so other aircraft know if someone else is at the airport. 2 other flights were also departing around the same time and were talking on the frequency and self announcing.\n\n> Southwest was apparently not talking on the tower frequency but were heard talking to Boston Center who gave them their clearance. The maintenance personnel advised the tower controller of the situation and even though the tower was closed at the time, the controller was getting ready for their shift and witnessed the event including broadcasting that runway 11/29 was closed. The Boston Center later asked the Southwest flight if they had departed runway 29 and they said yes. The controller asked them if they knew it was closed until 5:45 and the pilot responded with a yes. They said there were no markings and they departed after it was open and the controller advised them that they departed at 5:42 AM. \n\n> Thankfully the runway maintenance crew had situational awareness and got off the runway in time before a potential disaster occurred.\n\nI'm imagining the maintenance personnel moved while the flight was barreling down the runway, but I'm guessing in reality they moved as soon as they saw the flight lined up for takeoff.",

            "I know there\u2019s a serious air traffic controller shortage, but it seems like a terrible idea for an airport large enough to have a regular 737 route to be an uncontrolled airfield during periods of scheduled, routine commercial flights. Is this at all common? I assumed uncontrolled fields were only acceptable for small local airports that serve Cessnas or maybe the occasional leisure jet",
            "I suspect there was no actual risk of a collision here. The pilots probably saw the truck doing the final FOD check. Instead of waiting off the runway like they should, they decided to line up and wait for the workers to finish their check. This very reasonably frightened the workers and they did the right thing and got off the runway. Unfortunately the pilots interpreted this as the workers being done with their check rather than them fleeing and decided they might as well leave a few minutes early and that no one would notice. \n\nIf what I\u2019m thinking is the case, this is super sloppy stuff that has no place in aviation and it definitely WAS dangerous, but more in a \u201cyou took off on an uncleared runway and disregarded basic procedures\u201d way rather than a \u201cyou almost ran over a pickup truck\u201d way."

The problem is that we\u2019re in Poland, and such a trip would require taking a flight that would cross the Black Sea. Knowing how trigger happy the Russians are with passenger airliners and the fact that there are active hostilities taking place on the surface of the sea, is my fear of flying over that specific body of water justified?
