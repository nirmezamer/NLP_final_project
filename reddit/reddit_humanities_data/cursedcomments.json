        "content": " Hi everyone,\n\nHave you seen the same posts being reposted day after day, have you seen comments that are not cursed or even posts that aren\u2019t including a comment that seems to be made by a lost Redditor?\n\nIf the answer to one of these questions is \u2018yes\u2019 then you probably just saw a post being made by a **SPAM BOT**.\n\n**What is a spam bot?**\n\nA spam bot is an account that will repost both posts and comments to the subreddit to get karma and then promote scams.\n\n**How to spot spam bots?**\n\nSpam bots are usually easy to spot.\n\n* They have usernames that make no sense (Ex.: Hjoowhswhs)\n* They have usernames that could be used for NSFW/OF scam accounts (Ex.: SexyCute123)\n* They have auto-generated usernames (Ex.: No-Ad3281, Ok\\_Accurate2753 etc, etc)\n* Their accounts are old but they made their first posts only a few days ago\n* They sometimes make nonsensical posts that are either not cursed or don't include a comment\n* They repost old posts\n\nIf you see those bots, report them. The mod team is working hard to remove as much spam as possible but we cannot spot them all.\n\n**Why are spam bots bad?**\n\nOther than being unwanted because they repost rule-breaking content, spam bots are bad because they are usually scam accounts or accounts that get sold to scammers.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below or send us a [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcursedcomments).\n\n*-The cursed team*",
