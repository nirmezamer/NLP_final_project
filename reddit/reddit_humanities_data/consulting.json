            "For me, the biggest was the need to chill with putting out initial/working hypotheses.\n\nIn consulting, someone sharing an early, oversimplified hypothesis helps focus the team. Other team members challenge it, either right there or over coming days/weeks and more information emerges. The hypothesis gets refined and replaced as needed. \n\nIn real life, leading too early with an oversimplified hypothesis doesn't provoke others to improve it. It just makes people think you're an idiot and ignore you. Or, worse, stay silent on their misgivings, assume you have all the right answers and run with it, without that refinement or challenge (look up sunflower bias / sunflower management),\nUnless you truly are confident you have the (full) right answer, you have to let everyone wallow for a while and let the way forward emerge more organically.\n\nAs always, there are shades of grey. Consulting teams, juniors in particular, can feel unable to challenge a domineering or just more articulate senior. And you can collectively get into trouble for failing to consider alternate hypotheses. Outside consulting, with careful attention to your language and demeanor, you can put out a strawman for group improvement. But leading with an early, simplified working hypothesis is a building block of problem solving that tends to just work in consulting tends, but has to be unlearned or consciously modified when you leave.",
