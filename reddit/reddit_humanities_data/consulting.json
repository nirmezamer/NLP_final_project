            "The problem is there are too many inexperienced people claiming to be consultants. Every week we have college students on this forum asking how to get into consulting because they think they know it all. Maybe that was the case before the internet. But now consultancy should be about buying experience and expertise not just knowledge. Managers don't want to pay $20k for the knowledge they can find in a $20 book. But sadly most consultancy firms start off fleecing their clients sending in 24 year olds to tell them the blindingly obvious for weeks or months and only start to get to real change once the client is already becoming disillusioned with them.\n\nAI is going to radically transform the consultant business. There won't be any need for graduate consultants. AI will do that better, faster and cheaper. Consultancy will instead condense down to people with 20+ years in industry and business bringing their experience to the table to make sense of the knowledge and data. If you are a good consultant with experience and wisdom the next few years will be a golden time.",
