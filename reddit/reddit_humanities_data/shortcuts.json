When you run the shortcut, it will create a note in the Notes app with the title as the random prompt that you can then answer. \n\nDownload it here: [Journaling (Random Prompts)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f7069b2c6aec4aff8843717a2346bad1)\n\nI would appreciate it if anyone could come up with a way to pull the random prompts from a specific note rather than needing to edit the shortcut each time I want to add a prompt. That is above me.\n\nIf anyone makes any improvements, please share. \n\nHope you enjoy. \n\n\n\n-- If you use folders in your Notes app like I do, you can change the folder to which the note is automatically saved. At the bottom of the shortcut, where it says \"Create note with (note name) in (Notes),\" the Notes part at the end is where you can choose your folder. ",
