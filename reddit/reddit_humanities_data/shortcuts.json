            "Sorry. Tried it. Didn\u2019t work. Tried and tried for up to 10x and found it didn\u2019t work for me. So I gave up. (I don\u2019t really have a good use case for this. So I gave up easy)",
            "So you\u2019ve been posting these updates for a while and honestly I don\u2019t feel like reading through the shortcut. Can you give me a little a quick pseudo-code breakdown of how you accomplish this?",
            "Interesting shortcut. It's been a mixed success for me - in London, about 60% of the time, it won't accept places being added from Apple Maps via the share sheet, claiming they're not full addresses. I've checked each time, the entries do have full addresses. I wonder if perhaps it would be better to utilise coordinates?",
            "Why? Isint it just easy in google maps to rearrange stops to make it optimized. It hardly takes 3 seconds to do it. Hold and move it up and down. \n\nIf you could tell who benefits from this app/ shortcut it will be helpful to visualise the use.",
            "Care to elaborate? Or enable logging and DM me the logs?\n\nI tested every feature on my phone and Mac successfully before releasing the current version.",
            "Which part? \n\nAnd at this point the shortcut is nearly feature-complete. Would be nice to be able to share locations from Google Maps and Waze as well, and the menus could be prettier, but it probably won't get many more updates with features big enough to warrant a reddit post.\n\n# Building a list of locations for route planning\n\nThis part uses a bunch of different shortcut actions depending on the source of addresses. You can share locations from Apple Maps or share a Contact with the shortcut, and it processes the locations and adds them to an address list saved in iCloud or on your device if you don't want syncing.\n\nThe shortcut behaves different if you run it regular vs providing a location/contact as input, so that you don't need extra shortcuts to get this flexible behavior.\n\n# The route optimization is done in JavaScript.\n\nI precompute a \"cost\" for each pair of locations (drive time, drive distance, straight line distance, or straight line distance + elevation gain for \"bike mode\") to make a cost matrix. When straight line distance is used, I also use JavaScript to quickly compute the \"Haversine\" distance between each location. If bike mode is used, I use a free API to get location elevation estimates. Otherwise, I use the built-in \"get driving time\" or \"get driving distance\" shortcut actions.\n\n(It's instant to use straight line distance or bike mode. Using drive time or drive distance takes a bit to let Maps compute the time/distance between each location pair)\n\nThen pass the cost matrix to the JavaScript algorithm which finds the minimum (or maximum if you want) cost ordering of stops. After that I just need to construct the multi-stop URL for Apple/Google Maps.\n\n[Here's a shortcut with just the traveling salesman JS algorithm.](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/18895/)\n\n# Stop-by-stop navigation\n\nI store the stop-by-stop route (list of addresses, the app being used, the mode of transport, and the current stop number) as a json file in the shortcut's storage folder (next to address lists and logs). Then launch the map app of choice.\n\nWhen the user arrives at each stop, they run the shortcut again and it checks for a stop-by-stop json file. If there's a stop-by-stop file present, it loads up the next location to prompt the user if they'd like to navigate to the next stop or cancel. If the user wants to do the next stop then it starts navigating to the next stop and updates the stop-by-stop json file stop number for the next one.",
            "I use the \u201cget addresses from input\u201d action which ought to be successful at recognizing an address in the same region that the phone is configured for, but it sounds like that\u2019s not the case. Can you enable logging and DM me logs of you trying?",
            "Maybe check out the descriptions for the many apps that do the same thing for a $100/yr subscription? (See my other comment that lists them) Since this offers all the same features you get with one of those, but for free and forever. \n\n- This lets you do multi stop routes in Waze, which doesn\u2019t usually support multiple stops\n- Bike mode optimizes for distance and elevation gain, which you can\u2019t really do manually even unless you happen to know the elevation of all your stops in your head\n- This supports hundreds of stops; Apple and Google only support about a dozen\n- Routes are saved and can be loaded later, useful for folks that perform the same route frequently (milk/water delivery for example)\n- You say it\u2019s easy to do manually, but that\u2019s only true if you have just a couple stops. There are a huge number of possibilities for how to organize a multi stop route, especially if it\u2019s a tour like most delivery routes, finishing where they start. If you have a ten stop route, there are over 360k possible solutions to consider. For people that have such planning needs often, a route optimizer is essential. \n\nMy current lifestyle is such that I\u2019ll probably never use it.  I just made it because I could. Hopefully someone finds it useful. Based on the price of apps that do the same thing, someone will.",
            "It\u2019s possible it\u2019s my Mac issue. When I tried to add addresse, it didn\u2019t really pop up anything. Then I went to Apple Maps to find locations and tried that. Managed to add 1 location but then struggled to add the next. Not sure."
