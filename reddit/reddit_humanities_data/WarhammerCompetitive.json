Who would have guessed. Wolf Jail got its time to shine with 7 tournament wins and a 60% win rate carrying the faction to an overall win rate of 55%.\n\n**Grey Knights** are second best, also winning 7 events but having the second best win rate of the last 8 weeks at 54%\n\n**Orks** won the most events of the last Data Slate with 15 event wins. Their overall win rate of 52% hides the real monsters of Bully Boyz and Green tide with their 56% win rate and combined 12 wins. They both did all the heavy lifting of the faction.\n\n**Ad Mec** with an eight week win rate of 40%, expected but all hope for them rest with this new data slate. Hopefully they wont stay the worst army of the game.\n\n**Nids** with their 6 event wins still had the second worse win rate of the last two months at 42%. Did GW enough to help them? Who knows\n\n**Guard** won two events this weekend and had a great weekend overall. Really coming in strong just at the end of this period. \u00a0Overall with a 45% win rate and 6 event wins they really seemed kinda ok for a faction that just got completely remade.\n\n**Codex Space Marines** only gaining one event win this last data slate is sad. With their 43% overall win rate they have been hanging out at the bottom for at least the last month. Will they become the new worst faction of the game when all is said and done with these new changes? Probably?\n\n**Thousand Sons** as one of the best factions of the game is no surprise to anyone who has fought them the last little while. With their 53% win rate and 8 event wins, third most of the period. They are set to hit the new Meta even harder.\n\nWhile **Chaos Knights** had a nice weekend they along with Ad Mec, Deathwatch and Custodes did not win an event over the last 8 weeks and unlike those others Chaos Knights have being winning games. With a 47% win rate and top placings each week they had play but were not able to get past those top tables. \u00a0\n\n**Custodes** as one of the worst factions of the last little while. With no event wins and their 44% win rate its been a rough two months. Luckily it seems that GW has really helped out this middling faction. Custodes fell from the third most played faction to the 5^(th) least in these 8 weeks. Making up only 2.7% of the Meta when they made up over 8% just a few months ago. \u00a0\n\n**CSM** had the second most event wins at 10 with an overall win rate of 47%. They come in a lot weaker than most thought, I wonder why? The limited players of Pactbound seem to have found a winning detachment for them while the majority play Renegade Raiders with some few finding success with them.",

            "Man CSM got hit with the nerf bat pretty hard too, we\u2019re a much tougher army to play than I think most people realize and I think the nerds were too harsh, especially since we were already sub 50%. I expect to see less warp talons and more legionaries as we go forward",
            "I wonder how many of these events used the new rules",
            "Im looking forward to the Custodes and Imperial/Chaos Knight numbers once tournaments start using the balance sheet.",
            "I know it's small and silly, but in honor of GW finally coving AdMech a moment of attention, could you add the \"h\" to the end of the shorthand now, pretty please?",

            "Stormlance Wolves took quite a few hits but I still think it\u2019ll be the best performing detachment for Space Wolves, even with the Champions of Russ buffs. Time will tell."

        "content": "So, the new Pariah Nexus map layouts have changed how they show terrain placements - unlike Leviathan, which used some pretty specific terrain pieces in specific places, here you get the generic \"this area should be 4\" or more\" and \"this area should be 2\" or less\". That's great for giving the ability to use basically any terrain you have, but it raises the question - what about the movement? Do you use the actual terrain pieces to determine whether non-infantry can move through it? Or do you say \"this whole rectangle is 4\" tall, so Vehicles can't move through regardless of what actual terrain pieces you're using\"?\n\nFor example, let's take Pariah Layout 1, and those two big areas of terrain in the corners of the map that are connected to each other at corners. In Leviathan, due to the fact that the recommended terrain pieces didn't take the whole rectangle area, there was a gap between those areas though which pretty much any smaller non-Infantry model could fit. But if we take the Pariah layout, the whole area is marked as being 4\" tall, so if we do consider the whole area as having that height regardless of what terrain we're using, then nothing can fit through that gap.\n\nWhat do you think about this?
