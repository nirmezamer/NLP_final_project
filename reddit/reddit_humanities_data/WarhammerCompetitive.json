Who would have guessed. Wolf Jail got its time to shine with 7 tournament wins and a 60% win rate carrying the faction to an overall win rate of 55%.\n\n**Grey Knights** are second best, also winning 7 events but having the second best win rate of the last 8 weeks at 54%\n\n**Orks** won the most events of the last Data Slate with 15 event wins. Their overall win rate of 52% hides the real monsters of Bully Boyz and Green tide with their 56% win rate and combined 12 wins. They both did all the heavy lifting of the faction.\n\n**Ad Mec** with an eight week win rate of 40%, expected but all hope for them rest with this new data slate. Hopefully they wont stay the worst army of the game.\n\n**Nids** with their 6 event wins still had the second worse win rate of the last two months at 42%. Did GW enough to help them? Who knows\n\n**Guard** won two events this weekend and had a great weekend overall. Really coming in strong just at the end of this period. \u00a0Overall with a 45% win rate and 6 event wins they really seemed kinda ok for a faction that just got completely remade.\n\n**Codex Space Marines** only gaining one event win this last data slate is sad. With their 43% overall win rate they have been hanging out at the bottom for at least the last month. Will they become the new worst faction of the game when all is said and done with these new changes? Probably?\n\n**Thousand Sons** as one of the best factions of the game is no surprise to anyone who has fought them the last little while. With their 53% win rate and 8 event wins, third most of the period. They are set to hit the new Meta even harder.\n\nWhile **Chaos Knights** had a nice weekend they along with Ad Mec, Deathwatch and Custodes did not win an event over the last 8 weeks and unlike those others Chaos Knights have being winning games. With a 47% win rate and top placings each week they had play but were not able to get past those top tables. \u00a0\n\n**Custodes** as one of the worst factions of the last little while. With no event wins and their 44% win rate its been a rough two months. Luckily it seems that GW has really helped out this middling faction. Custodes fell from the third most played faction to the 5^(th) least in these 8 weeks. Making up only 2.7% of the Meta when they made up over 8% just a few months ago. \u00a0\n\n**CSM** had the second most event wins at 10 with an overall win rate of 47%. They come in a lot weaker than most thought, I wonder why? The limited players of Pactbound seem to have found a winning detachment for them while the majority play Renegade Raiders with some few finding success with them.",

            "\"CSM had the second most event wins at 10 with an overall win rate of 47%. They come in a lot weaker than most thought, I wonder why? The limited players of Pactbound seem to have found a winning detachment for them while the majority play Renegade Raiders with some few finding success with them.\"\n\n\nCSM actually have a much higher skill ceiling than a lot of people realise. Unless you play CSM it's difficult to see that. That's why you see good players getting a lot of wins, but the faction still having a middling win rate.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso a lot of people didn't realise how much CSM was crutching on Dark Obscuration early on. Take that away and the factions durability takes a big nerf.",
            "i think guard will play very tank heavy now and we will see an overall winrate rise but less tournament winnings at the top level",
            "Tyranid buffs got me excited to try them again. Neurotyrant being able to join Zoanthropes is huge for the +1 to hit and +1 to wound on battleshocked units. gives a nice overwatch target, too. +1 Strength let us reach a lot of useful breakpoints. Str 10 twin linked on hive tyrants/swarmlords? s4 hormogaunts, s5 genestealers, s6 twin linked melee warriors.\n\nThe cp reduction ability rework also helps hive tyrants a lot, as well as the cp increase aura of the swarmlord since he wants to run up the board anyway and is kind of tanky. and on the topic of hive tyrant, lethal hit aura is very nice. in invasion fleet you can get sustained 1 vs infantry and lethal hits on anything shooting, which is nice especially for the neurotyrant and zoanthrope blob i was talking about earlier. exocrines like it a lot, too.\n\nlastly the additional ld debuff rly makes shadow in the warp somewhat useful, finally. it's also the only direct ld debuff we have, besides dirgeheart in synaptic nexus, the rest just worsens the battleshock roll so even with the \"ld cant get worse than 8+\" errata they will stack.\n\nIf it's enough? i'm kinda confident that yes, it will be. at least nids are much more fun to play now.\n\nedit: oh, just one thing. WHY DIDNT THEY GIVE THE LICTOR THE 5++ BACK?!?! i dont get it. it doesnt make much of a difference anyway. it pains me.",
            "It will be interesting to see what happens with custodes. Most of my local custodes players have said they aren't planning to start playing the faction again despite the buffs. They just don't enjoy how the army plays now.",
            "Over-Under on Codex Marines taking lowest win rate?\n\nI personally think we\u2019ll see a 3-4% drop across the board with marine factions. The biggest threats weren\u2019t nerfed enough to offset marine losses and the worse factions got buffed.\n\nHopefully marines sitting bottom of the table forces GW to finally address the poor design that led to this",
            "I\u2019m wondering how guard will play out with the changes, losing double field of fire and reinforcement spam will definitely hurt\u00a0",
            "Man CSM got hit with the nerf bat pretty hard too, we\u2019re a much tougher army to play than I think most people realize and I think the nerds were too harsh, especially since we were already sub 50%. I expect to see less warp talons and more legionaries as we go forward",
            "I wonder how many of these events used the new rules",
            "Im looking forward to the Custodes and Imperial/Chaos Knight numbers once tournaments start using the balance sheet."

            "Warp Talons and Sticky Objective Question:\n\nObviously, normally you take an objective if you control it at the end of a phase. *But,* the \"objective secured\" abilities says that, once you've sticked an objective, you control it until an opponent controls it at the end of a turn. Meanwhile, warp talons, if they kill a unit, vanish back into strategic reserve at the end of the *fight* phase. \n\nSo ... if warp talons drop, charge something on a stickied objective, kill that unit entirely, and then vanish back into strategic reserve, what happens to the stickied objective? Do the warp talons unsticky it at then end of the fight phase right before they disappear? Or does the \"objective secured\" ability control and since the warp talons weren't there to take it at the end of the turn, the player who stickied it retains control?",

        "content": "So, the new Pariah Nexus map layouts have changed how they show terrain placements - unlike Leviathan, which used some pretty specific terrain pieces in specific places, here you get the generic \"this area should be 4\" or more\" and \"this area should be 2\" or less\". That's great for giving the ability to use basically any terrain you have, but it raises the question - what about the movement? Do you use the actual terrain pieces to determine whether non-infantry can move through it? Or do you say \"this whole rectangle is 4\" tall, so Vehicles can't move through regardless of what actual terrain pieces you're using\"?\n\nFor example, let's take Pariah Layout 1, and those two big areas of terrain in the corners of the map that are connected to each other at corners. In Leviathan, due to the fact that the recommended terrain pieces didn't take the whole rectangle area, there was a gap between those areas though which pretty much any smaller non-Infantry model could fit. But if we take the Pariah layout, the whole area is marked as being 4\" tall, so if we do consider the whole area as having that height regardless of what terrain we're using, then nothing can fit through that gap.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

Anything can move through ruins less than <2\" in height.\n\nThe footprints with walls over 4\" show where those L wall sections are. So vehicles cannot move through those walls but can move onto the footprint where the walls are not.\n\nThe footprints of <2\" don't bother showing the ruins, but so long as they're symmetrical it should be fair. The point here is, most tanks / vehicles can move through, they will almost certainly need to fully clear the footprint, but if they can move far enough, they can start on one side and drive through to the other.\n\nAnd depending upon where the ruin walls are actually located on the <2\" foot prints, they might well be able to start / end partly on the footprint.\n\nTake layout 7. It has <2\" footprints between >4\" footprints. This is by desgin as the <2\" is just under 4\" wide, most tanks and dreads (on 100mm bases) are just under 4\" wide, so they can drive through this section. Quite important this, if you're a tank army trying to get out of your Hammer and Anvil deployment zone on this layout.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about these layouts which inexperienced players might not realise when looking at them is, they work.

        "content": "I really want to field my DW boys in the competitive scene. They are my favorite faction with the best color scheme and cool lore to back them up. As we all know however, they are currently the lowest play, least competitively viable army in the game since 2 weeks into 10e, and got little to no help in every data slate and MFM update since.\n\nThe point here is not to complain (though I totally am), my actual question is how can I field them competitively? I've tried a few tricks, like using Tome for full re-rolls and Telepotarium shenanigans (Centurion Devastators are great for this, but die too quickly, especially to OW), or using several group of vets and watch masters to get great alpha strike off. But each list gets tabled (or becomes useless) on round 2 or 3 because we just don't have enough firepower or toughness to make our points count.\n\nMy current list consists of repulsors with DW vets + Watch Master in them to ferry them into position and alpha strike (using LT or Apothecaries), using eliminators in the back line for defense and screening, gladiator lancer for anti-tank and brutalis dread for back up. Tack on jump intercessors and/or incursors for screening and point scoring and you have a fieldable enough army in casual, but competitively all the marines just melt and you are left losing to primary. I know the new Pariah Nexus missions have a focus on battleline units, but I don't think this will be as impactful as people are assuming it will be.\n\nAny advice from you vets of the competitive scene? Or should I just wait for GW to notice Death Watch exists and (hopefully) tries to fix us?",

            "One of my friends made a 6 predator list with the tomb enhancement and it was kinda rolling people at our LGS. It was 6 predators, jump intercessors with a captain(he had tomb), gladiator lancer, 9 inceptors, infiltrators and scouts I think?",
            "A lot of comments here are going to come from people who have never played Deathwatch, and probably have never played against Deathwatch either, just doomposting. It is the least played faction *in tournaments* because it is hard to play, very hard to collect and build, relatively new, and Space Marines as a whole army are not in a good place (too expensive, not enough buffs).\n\nYour approach for casual games is fine, but to make it more competitive you just need to lean into the good Deathwatch/Space Marine units that are much tougher - gravis and terminator armor + tanks. Power armor units are for screening, meat shields\n\n**There are a lot of different ways to field a competitive Deathwatch army, and Pariah Nexus is going to help in a few interesting ways.**\n\n1. Deathwatch Veterans are on the pricier side, but they have access to a 4++, a S10 melee weapon, and multiple heavy bolters/heavy flamers. Probably the pound-for-pound best battleline unit.\n2. In a game that prizes mobility, you have a 1 CP stratagem that lets you move TWO units anywhere on the table. This is like Vanguard's Guerilla Tactics + Urial Ventris but on any units you want. Centurion Devastators are obviously popular here, but with the new Captain rule, a combo of Gravis Captain + Indomitor Kill Team and one other kill team (usually a second Indomitor or Veterans squad) with an Inquisitor means you can not only pick up and then deep strike two units, but on a 3+ you gain a CP for doing so.\n3. The BSTF buffs heavily favor high-volume firepower. Indomitor kill teams, vehicles with a large number of attacks (like Repulsor defensive arrays), and Vindicators all get a lot out of it.\n4. The revised captain rule also gives you the choice to put any unit into lethal hits/sustained hits any turn you want. It also gives you access to free Teleport, which is key to completing one of the new secret missions by getting your warlord on your opponents home objective.\n5. Tome of Ectoclades and Beacon Angelis and Thief of Secrets are not only some of the top enhancements in the game individually, but probably the most synergistic 1-2-3 in any detachment. Full hit and wound re-rolls on two units (combined with sustained hits and devastating wound weapons like those aforementioned S10 thunder hammers your battleline carry), giving one unit deep strike AND rapid ingress, and turning one of your characters into an insanely hard-hitting melee blender. A Gravis Captain can have 5 S10/Ap4/D4 attacks AND 2 S7/AP4/D4 attacks. With sustained hits, lethal hits (by pairing with an apothecary biologis) and full hit and wound re-rolls from tome.\n6. Inceptors are another really good unit here. They, Indomitor Kill Teams and boltstorm aggressors are really good with SIA - anti-infantry 2+ or +1 AP.\n7. The Watchmaster + new vect rules could be a lot of fun. 12\" radius of +1CP shuts down a lot of army synergy in melee. I don't love it because I am skeptical of using power armor bodies for anything but meat shields and secondaries, but others have been excited about it.\n\nBecause of the above, the common way to play Deathwatch is combining a lot of shooting, a bit of melee, A LOT of mobility, and having a \"go\" turn where you sync everything up to your shooting and charges and take out 1/3 of your opponents army.",
            "Do what dark angels player do: play the best regular marine list you can and slap a watch master in it. Marines getting better transport capacity might be nice for them?\n\nI think they are not the \"worst\" army, as you still have datasheets that work a large suite of some pretty decent detachments and some cool tricks. I think the problem simply is that your deathwatch specific units are kinda crap. \n\nCause tome is fun, but I think your just gonna get more mileage out of gladius, nerfed ironstorm or vanguard; and not be very \"deathwatchy\"; which is why their WR is bad: if your playing ironstorm marines with a watchmaster why wouldnt you play ironstorm marines with azzy or templars. But swaping arazel for a watch master isnt gonna make your dudes unplayable.\n\n>but competitively all the marines just melt and you are left losing to primary.\n\nI think this is the issue; the games balanced all its guns about killing marines, which is fine if your intercessors are 80pts and die; but not fine if your paying triple that for some special deathwatch marines.",

            "I think DW is in a way better spot than people are admitting. The issue is that you kind of have to run one specific list, that includes: \n\nA Watch Captain with The Tome of Ectoclades. It\u2019s awkward because he has to be on the field, but I\u2019ve been running him with Company Heroes to pretty good effect. \n\nAn apothecary biologus with Beacon Angelis to get deepstrike and free ingress. This attached to  an aggressor or eradicator said can ingress behind a wall move into melta range, then get picked up at the end of your opponents turn and do it again. \n\nA big brick of Centurions, to once again abuse up-down rule and present your opponent with a big hefty issue early game. \n\nI also like a 6 man bolter inceptor squad, as they work well with the Strats we have regarding bolters. \n\nFrom there it\u2019s pretty much whatever flavor of scoring you\u2019d like.",
            "DW aren\u2019t nearly as bad as people say. They have a couple strengths to lean into- the main trap that players fall into is over investing in the kill team units (most of which are overcosted and bad) and not leaning into the strengths.\n\nThe strengths are considerable. \n\n1-Sustained and lethals for one turn each is a big deal- you basically can run leaderless marine squads and get the benefit something like a lieutenant would provide. This means you can do one character in the whole army, and have all your squads get damage juice on the two turns where the fighting actually goes down just for existing. Lets you build your list wider and get efficiency out of every unit.\n\n2- tome of the ectoclades double super oath is one of, if not >the< strongest damage buff in the whole game. The one character you take? He takes this. \n\n3- teleportarium is super good strat. Vanguard shows how good this is, and it\u2019s just as good here. I argue you should have exactly two kill team units (i think deathwatch vets and indomitor are the good ones), and you do an absolutely devastating turn 2 \u201cdrop turn\u201d by teleporting these two units, popping your army out, use your ectoclades tome and lethal or sustained, and blow the hell out of them. It\u2019s super mega nasty.\n\nThat\u2019s basically it\u2026 sure some of the strats and units aren\u2019t as functional as we\u2019d like, some are even traps. But those things above are absolutely strengths and are quite powerful. You just have to correctly recognize and lean into them, which is where I think a lot of people trip themselves up. I think using the built in sustained/lethals and minimal kill team investment to build wide is the big one that people miss.",
            "Heroic Intervention is now 1cp. \n\nRapid ingress 0cp.\n\nIdk how this isnt being talked about.",
            "Short answer? No.\n\nLonger answer? There is always hope, but you are playing one of the weakest armies in the Game. Other then GSC, against a player of similar skill, you will lose almost every time.",
            "Yes, there is hope. I do not see DeathWatch going away. Best  hope they are with Imperal Agents codex that comes out soon.",
            "I thought the current rumor was deathwatch is being combined into agents of the imperium and the agents codex is getting actual army rules.\n\nLike if they do that deathwatch marines army might be pawnable to other armies and/or the deathwatch can still have a detachment to make kill team only armies supported by a restricted list of space marine units."
