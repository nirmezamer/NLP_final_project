It's a Remix Node.JS application that uses MongoDB for the database.\n\nMy current approach is to create:\n\n1. a VM that runs MongoDB (with data stored on a small separate disk)\n2. a container app that runs the application itself built with docker from GitHub\n\nNow, I don't know if my current approach is the best (please tell me if not!!) but I'd like to know if there would be a way to peer those 2 services so that the container app can access the database more efficiently.\n\nThe services are in one region so I kind of assumed it would be possible, but I can't seem to find the option. I hope it wouldn't require me to dellocate/recreate the services. Thank you!!",

Now connecting these can happen in multiple ways:\u00a0 DB is reachable either fully public, retricted or in private only. I would opt for last option, only allowing access to the db from the container apps and completely shut off the public endpoint."
