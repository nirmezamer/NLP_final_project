        "content": "Hello-hello, r/Garmin party people! **Happy New Year!!**\n\nAs we kickstart 2024, and set off after our goals, aspirations, and resolutions, we mustn\u2019t forget that we don\u2019t have to do it all alone. \n\nSo, what better way to reach those fitness goals than to challenge, push, and motivate one another. \n\nWith the success of our r/Garmin Zombie Walk, which hundreds of you joined, it was clear to me that we have something special here. I\u2019ve never felt more confident in a communities willingness to accomplish great things. \n\nI\u2019m pleased to announce the **r/Garmin Monthly Challenge**.\n\nThis reoccurring, optional, challenge will be divided into three categories (Challenges).\n\n- Walking \n- Running \n- Cycling \n- Swimming \n\nEach challenge will last **all** month. So, feel free to join them all, or perhaps just the one in particular that interests you the most!\n\nOne of the things I found most rewarding about our past challenge was the ability to connect directly with the you, our community. I\u2019m a very personable individual, who enjoys nothing more than watching those around me rise. So, while in the future the format used may shift, as it stands currently the challenges will be in the connect challenge format.\n\nThis means each month I will be sending you an invite, to each challenge, which you can totally decline if you\u2019d like to skip or take a break! \n\nLastly, though it should go without saying, we must adhere to the same rules within this community in our challenges. While this is a place to have fun, we should all still maintain a standard of professionalism at all times. Failure to do so will result in you being removed from existing and future events. Also, once a challenge has begun, if you have not already joined, you will be ineligible to join until the start of the next challenge. \n\n**Joining the challenge instructions**\n\n- Connect with me [here](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/0875cc4c-eb0b-495b-99f0-7fe7897c3896)\n- After connecting, within the last three days of each month (USA: Eastern time for reference) you will receive three invites for a \u201cconnect challenge\u201d with the title of each challenge.\n- Simply accept or decline the challenges to enter or skip them. \n- Once accepted, the challenge will officially begin on the 1st of each month, respective of your geographical location. \n\nThen, it\u2019s off to the races! \n\nI look forward to the challenges, camaraderie, and milestones that are sure to follow. Let\u2019s do this thing!\n\nCheers\n\n\n**note / disclosure**\n\nInvites are sent out up to three days **prior** to the challenge start date. Connect request must be made prior to 5:00PM EST on the last day of the calendar month to receive an invite to the upcoming challenge. Once a challenge starts, should you have not been connected previously and received an invite, you will be ineligible to be added to it. However, you will be automatically added to the next months challenge when invites go out. In future version, winners are subject to have their first name used when the congratulations / shout-out post is made. If you do not wish to have this done, do not partake in the challenge. \n\nBy partaking in each challenge you\u2019re agreeing to terms listed above. ",

            "Update\n\nHey, yall! \n\nI am aware that some users have tried to connect with me and it\u2019s advising I have reached my maximum connect limit. \n\nI am working on revamping the challenge and will announce how this will work soon. This will allow, in theory, unlimited users to partake. Stay tuned!",
            "I look forward to placing at the bottom, based on the insane performances in the walking challenge.\n\nGood luck everybody and thank you, Andrew!!",
            "How do we actually join the challenge? When I click on the link it takes me to your profile and says that you only share certain information publicly. What I need to do?",

            "Sounds good. Not sure I\u2019ll be very competitive compared to some of the beasts on here but I\u2019ll give it a go. I\u2019ve sent you a connect request.",
            "Than you Andrew for organising these.",
            "Update \n\n- No swim / cycling challenge this month (June). I am working with Garmin, testing a feature, and it\u2019s impacting my ability to see active challenges. I was able to do a running, walking though! Should be back to business next month for the other two challenge types. :)",
            "Thank you for organizing! I'm excited to join! I just got my first Garmin 2 days ago and am obsessed with it!",

            "It prompts and says that \u201cAndrew has reached their limit of 1000 connections.\u201d thus not letting me connect.\u00a0"

        "content": "I was training with a Garmin 10k plan on Tuesday, and my heart rate jumped to over 200 from the 150 range which is normal for me doing fast paced intervals (49m). At first I thought something was wrong with my watch. But after about 15 minutes my heart rate returned to normal range and I finished my run. \n\nAfter cleaning up I stopped by my GP and asked why my heart rate would have jumped like that. She sent me for a blood test and asked if I had any physical symptoms. I said my throat felt tight and armpits felt tingly, and my jaw felt fatigued. All of these I could explain away by grinding teeth at night, allergies, and I sleep on my arms often putting them to sleep. \n\nI get the blood work back quickly, and the dr tells me I had a heart attack. \n\nI would have never known if it had not been for my Garmin smartwatch telling me my heart rate. Thanks and I am now telling everyone I know they should have a fitness watch so they can know for sure when something is wrong. ",

            "Props to you for going to your GP and getting it checked out instead of coming on reddit and asking here first.",
            "Wow, that\u2019s wild. How are you feeling now??",
            "Glad you went to check! Hope you are okay. My friend think i\u2019m harming myself wearing this Garmin watch all\nthe time. Whatever invisible wave that could be bad for the body. I like to see data, and my heart rate and etc. being monitored . It is very helpful",
            "Genuine question, how does bloodwork indicate a heart attack took place?",
            "Thank you for sharing, hope everything is good!",
            "I had a similar issue. Started to find just running normally would send my heart rate up to over 200, and my resting heart rate would be about 115 instead of 50. Turns out I developed a hyperactive thyroid.",
            "But did you die?",
            "I had hart attack while wearing a Fitbit. Didn\u2019t really show anything. I upgraded to a Garmin and watch my stats very closely. I the best shape of my life",
            "to everybody who reads this and thinks HR can detect a cardiac event - please DON'T assume that. HR \\_can\\_ be in some ways, but \\_is not always\\_ an indicator of a heart attack. if you don't feel comfortable and think something might be up, don't defer going to the doc because your \"HR is ok\".",
            "Ohhh wow!!!! My experience is similar but \u201cunfit\u201d version. \nI\u2019m mostly sedentary office job. Exercise is walking the dog 5km each day \nSitting at my desk the abnormal heart rate alert was going off. 70 to 112. \nWent doctors and did the bloods, ecg and HRM 24 hrs. Then angiogram and calcium score. \nA few episodes triggered at work. Not wfh. \nWaiting for results and from reading the comments here may be SVT. But will see this week. Considering fam history. \n100% agree wearing Garmin has benefits and outweighs any radiation/sensor crap."
