        "content": "Hello-hello, r/Garmin party people! **Happy New Year!!**\n\nAs we kickstart 2024, and set off after our goals, aspirations, and resolutions, we mustn\u2019t forget that we don\u2019t have to do it all alone. \n\nSo, what better way to reach those fitness goals than to challenge, push, and motivate one another. \n\nWith the success of our r/Garmin Zombie Walk, which hundreds of you joined, it was clear to me that we have something special here. I\u2019ve never felt more confident in a communities willingness to accomplish great things. \n\nI\u2019m pleased to announce the **r/Garmin Monthly Challenge**.\n\nThis reoccurring, optional, challenge will be divided into three categories (Challenges).\n\n- Walking \n- Running \n- Cycling \n- Swimming \n\nEach challenge will last **all** month. So, feel free to join them all, or perhaps just the one in particular that interests you the most!\n\nOne of the things I found most rewarding about our past challenge was the ability to connect directly with the you, our community. I\u2019m a very personable individual, who enjoys nothing more than watching those around me rise. So, while in the future the format used may shift, as it stands currently the challenges will be in the connect challenge format.\n\nThis means each month I will be sending you an invite, to each challenge, which you can totally decline if you\u2019d like to skip or take a break! \n\nLastly, though it should go without saying, we must adhere to the same rules within this community in our challenges. While this is a place to have fun, we should all still maintain a standard of professionalism at all times. Failure to do so will result in you being removed from existing and future events. Also, once a challenge has begun, if you have not already joined, you will be ineligible to join until the start of the next challenge. \n\n**Joining the challenge instructions**\n\n- Connect with me [here](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/0875cc4c-eb0b-495b-99f0-7fe7897c3896)\n- After connecting, within the last three days of each month (USA: Eastern time for reference) you will receive three invites for a \u201cconnect challenge\u201d with the title of each challenge.\n- Simply accept or decline the challenges to enter or skip them. \n- Once accepted, the challenge will officially begin on the 1st of each month, respective of your geographical location. \n\nThen, it\u2019s off to the races! \n\nI look forward to the challenges, camaraderie, and milestones that are sure to follow. Let\u2019s do this thing!\n\nCheers\n\n\n**note / disclosure**\n\nInvites are sent out up to three days **prior** to the challenge start date. Connect request must be made prior to 5:00PM EST on the last day of the calendar month to receive an invite to the upcoming challenge. Once a challenge starts, should you have not been connected previously and received an invite, you will be ineligible to be added to it. However, you will be automatically added to the next months challenge when invites go out. In future version, winners are subject to have their first name used when the congratulations / shout-out post is made. If you do not wish to have this done, do not partake in the challenge. \n\nBy partaking in each challenge you\u2019re agreeing to terms listed above. ",

            "Than you Andrew for organising these.",
            "Ive sent a request. Now heres to propping up the bottom ",
            "It prompts and says that Andrew has reached their limit of 1000 connections. thus not letting me connect.",
            "Appreciate the work you put in! Any chance for a Hiking challenge in the future or nah?",
            "Got my 10k April 12- 14 today :)",
            "The link says you share information with certain people. Are we still able to connect for challenges?"

        "content": "I was training with a Garmin 10k plan on Tuesday, and my heart rate jumped to over 200 from the 150 range which is normal for me doing fast paced intervals (49m). At first I thought something was wrong with my watch. But after about 15 minutes my heart rate returned to normal range and I finished my run. \n\nAfter cleaning up I stopped by my GP and asked why my heart rate would have jumped like that. She sent me for a blood test and asked if I had any physical symptoms. I said my throat felt tight and armpits felt tingly, and my jaw felt fatigued. All of these I could explain away by grinding teeth at night, allergies, and I sleep on my arms often putting them to sleep. \n\nI get the blood work back quickly, and the dr tells me I had a heart attack. \n\nI would have never known if it had not been for my Garmin smartwatch telling me my heart rate. Thanks and I am now telling everyone I know they should have a fitness watch so they can know for sure when something is wrong. ",

            "Props to you for going to your GP and getting it checked out instead of coming on reddit and asking here first.",
            "Wow, thats wild. How are you feeling now??",
            "Glad you went to check! Hope you are okay. My friend think im harming myself wearing this Garmin watch all\nthe time. Whatever invisible wave that could be bad for the body. I like to see data, and my heart rate and etc. being monitored . It is very helpful",
            "Genuine question, how does bloodwork indicate a heart attack took place?",
            "Well fuck, as someone with severe health anxiety I should not have read this because Ive had numerous tests (and ER visits) over the years and all my heart symptoms (similar to yours) were always panic attacks but now Ill always wonder what if this time this is different - Im glad youre ok !",
            "Thank you for sharing, hope everything is good!",
            "I had a similar issue. Started to find just running normally would send my heart rate up to over 200, and my resting heart rate would be about 115 instead of 50. Turns out I developed a hyperactive thyroid.",
            "You took a break in your run to have a heart attack and still finished before going to visit your doc? Makes ever \"my knee hurts\" excuse sound a joke. \n\nGlad you're still with us!",
            "to everybody who reads this and thinks HR can detect a cardiac event - please DON'T assume that. HR \\_can\\_ be in some ways, but \\_is not always\\_ an indicator of a heart attack. if you don't feel comfortable and think something might be up, don't defer going to the doc because your \"HR is ok\".",
            "Clearly not medical advice here, and listen to your doctor, but the grand majority of time your heart will actually slow down to an unusually slow pace during a heart attack, because you loose blood supply to the electrical conduction system, except if it caused an arrythmia like ventricular tachycardia. But in a presumably healthy person who exercises frequently, it is more likely you had a different and way less deadly arrythmia callled SVT, supracentricular tachycardia. It tends to occur when your fight or flight hormones are peaked as in when you exercise. It will still cause your troponin to be elevated because the blood supply to your heart can't keep up with the heart rate, which is commonly 200bpm+, rather than being from a blocked coronary artery. I would still do whatever testing your doc recommends, but i would ask about a cardiac monitor and hold off any any caffine you may be taking."
