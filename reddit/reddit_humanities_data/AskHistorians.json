Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.\n\nSome questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.\n\nHere are the ground rules:\n\n* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.\n* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.\n* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.\n* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.\n* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.\n* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).\n* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.",

I want to make sure that while my grandpa is still with us I ask good questions so that perhaps his story is useful for my children and maybe others. \n\nFor additional context, my grandfather was born in 1925 Michigan. As a child he remembers life in the Great Depression. His father was a sign maker for a while with dreams of being an artist but went out of business. Several of his relatives had farms he would stay on. \n\nWhen he turned 18 he was drafted into the Navy and was deployed to Pearl Harbor in 1944. There he did various jobs around the island. He did not see combat and claims that he was part of an outfit that was going to be shipped to Iwo Jima, but was moved off of that group two weeks beforehand for unknown reasons. I think after the war ended he toured other places in the pacific before returning home. \n\nAt home he worked as an accountant for Ford and met his wife on some singles trip to meet people. He lived in Michigan his whole life. Has yet to see the lions win a Super Bowl.\n\nI\u2019ve asked a lot of other various questions about his opinion on events, historical figures, family history, but I don\u2019t know if there are some details that I should be asking on that I am unaware of because I\u2019m not a historian.

Not that some of their questions might not be good to ask, but you don't want to shackle yourself with such a random approach. More go in with a general plan, and be flexible based on the responses you get.\n\nIn any case though, as for having a plan, please look up the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress. They are a fantastic resource on this matter! Check out their page here:https://www.loc.gov/vets:\n\n>The Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress collects, preserves and makes accessible the firsthand recollections of U.S. military veterans who served from World War I through more recent conflicts and peacekeeping missions, so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand what they saw, did and felt during their service.\n\nTo get the most value, and potentially make his recollections accessible for researchers even, read up about how to conduct an interview using their guidelines. [This page will give you all the information about the field kit for doing so.](https://www.loc.gov/programs/veterans-history-project/how-to-participate/vhp-field-kit/) It has all the forms to use, guidance for participation in all roles, and even sample questions to consider (and lot of them are important general inquiries which being better understanding and contextualizing of the interviewee).\n\nSo yeah, if you are interviewing a veteran, please make this your first stop. Even if you don't plan on doing it precisely their way with the intention of eventually providing that record to the VHP, just for a more casual, personal discussion it will be invaluable in guiding you.\n\nYou can also find more information about the VHP and their mission from the AMAs that the organization has held with us in the past:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3zevmy/ama_the_library_of_congress_veterans_history/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5e4aj0/we_are_the_library_of_congress_veterans_history/",
