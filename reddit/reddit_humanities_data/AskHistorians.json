            "I'm a nontraditional student and community college history major based in Los Angeles. Prior to returning to college, I worked in film and television for over a decade (and I continue to work in the entertainment industry while completing my degree). I've always loved media history. If I ever answer a question here outside of the weekly posts, it's probably going to be about the intersection of mass media production and history.\n\nDue to a prior stint in college, I don't have a hell of a lot of room for electives or an additional minor. I also realize that it doesn't really matter what you \"specialize in\" as an undergrad. While in an ideal world I'd use my history degree to pivot into local public history work re media, film, or television, I also realize that there are USC Film PhDs who want all of those jobs, while I'm just a dropout who knows about film and also knows about history. And that in real life I'm probably going to stay a paralegal forever.\n\nMy community college offers a few film history courses in the media studies department, and depending where I finish my BA I could potentially get into some upper-division media history courses in the film department as a non-major. None of these fulfill any requirements for my history major, or any other requirements I still need to fulfill to graduate.\n\nIf I want to end up with a background in film history, what do I do?",

            "One major reason is that while currants are a \u2018basic fruit\u2019 in the UK, they are not as well known in the US, and this is because they are not as widely cultivated or sold. This in turn is due to the fact that blackcurrants were not native to the US, and were banned federally (usually cited as in 1911, with differing sources, but certainly by the 1920s), because they spread the white pine blister rust, a fungus which damages white pines, which are very important for US ecosystems and the timber industry. Those currants already in the US were slowly eradicated across the 1920s-1930s.\n\nIn the UK and much of the rest of Europe, the worst affected white pines are not native, and while the disease can affect others to a lesser extent, there were efforts to clear these out. Currants were after all native and long part of the culture, so bans were not a consideration.\n\nThe federal government legalised them again in 1966, though many states kept their own bans. But most of the core, popular artificial flavours were developed in the decades before then, as the sweets/candy industry and industrial food chemistry, including flavourants like the esters used for artificial blackcurrant flavour, exploded.\n\nThe idea of sweets with various fruit flavours - marked by different colourants in a simple colour-coding - slowly developed in the same period across the Atlantic, and blackcurrants became one of the defaults only where they were well-known. But artificial grape flavour is far from unknown in the UK, and there are even popular (non-alcoholic!) \u2018wine gum\u2019 pastilles. But this would be the main reason for the lack of blackcurrant awareness in the US.\u00a0",

            "The ban on currants also roughly coincided with prohibition. As a result, wine producers had a massive oversupply of grapes. This drove down the price of grapes and raisins. Recipes that call for dried currants in the UK all use raisins in the US. Grape juice became cheap and widely available at this time too, and only some of it was made into wine at home. Americans just developed a love of grape flavor.",

            "Wow! A question I can actually answer!\n\nThe Guanche people were the native inhabitants of the Canary Islands, a group of islands off the coast of Africa now belonging to Spain. While their genetic origins are not confirmed, studies have shown that they share a lot of DNA with North Africans of Berber ancestry. They did not have seafaring skills, so it is unclear how they got to the islands. They may have been transported there by another group, or have previously had boats but lost their seafaring skills over time. The fact they couldn\u2019t travel over water meant they were incredibly isolated.\n\nIn 1341, the King of Portugal sent explorers to the Canaries. Explorers from other countries soon followed, but none established permanent settlements in the 14th century. In 1402, French forces captured Lanzarote, an island in the Canaries. This was not the first colonialist action in the islands, however; before 1402, hundreds of Guanche had been captured for slavery.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 80,000 Guanche people in 1478. In 1479, the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas recognized Spanish sovereignty over the islands. The Spanish wanted the Canaries to be an available stop for other voyages, but it took the Spanish a while to conquer all of the islands, though. In 1495, the Spanish conquered Tenerife, the largest of the islands, after two invasions. The Guanche\u2019s isolation made them vulnerable to diseases from the Spanish. Spanish fighters also had horses, unlike the Guanche. Many Guanche were forced to assimilate, while others were enslaved. \n\nBy 1541, there was reportedly only one Guanche person left on the islands.

Would the people shutting down the schools be pro-Mao or anti-Mao? Either way, what was the impetus to do this and how were people being recruited for the task?

            "There's one crucial point to clarify at the outset: Mao's grip on power wasn't particularly strong in the four years preceding the Cultural Revolution.\n\nFollowing his disastrous policies that led to at least 15 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, Mao was forced to admit his mistakes openly before a gathering of 7,000 high-ranking officials in early 1962. He subsequently entrusted the country's administration to Liu Shaoqi, the nominal head of state at the time.\n\nHowever, Liu, only five years younger than Mao, seemed to be a growing threat to Mao's authority during his three years in power. To regain control, Mao devised a strategy to incite social unrest against the government rather than directly confront Liu.\n\nHe began with subtle maneuvers that Liu was hesitant to oppose. In November 1965, he initiated a discussion on a historical play, pressuring senior officials to agree with his assessment. This resulted in the removal of those who disagreed, some of whom were key allies of Liu.\n\nMao then sharpened his focus on Liu. In May 1966, he encouraged teachers and students at Peking University (then and still China's most prestigious university) to publicly criticize their university leaders and local government through large-scale posters. These attacks inspired similar actions by young people across China, effectively paralyzing Liu's government.\n\nThe climax arrived in August 1966 with the publication of Mao's own poster, marking his final assault on Liu. Within a week, Liu was officially disqualified as Mao's successor.\n\nAlthough the political battle at the highest level neared its conclusion, a fierce struggle continued between those following Mao's teachings to overthrow their leaders and those currently in charge of government institutions.\n\nSchools became one of the most intense battlegrounds due to Mao's appeal to young people. Many students who disliked studying or struggled with impulse control were labeled pro-Mao, while many teachers were seen as anti-Mao.\n\nIn answer to your question, those who shut down schools were likely pro-Mao. However, Mao's teachings were merely a tool they used to justify and legitimize their behavior. Both sides wielded Mao's words as weapons.\n\nThe pro-Mao\u2019s impetus to challenge the established system wasn't solely self-motivated. They were victims of the prevailing political climate. Mao's repeated calls for public defiance of authority and established rules were taken to the extreme, where any incomplete challenge was seen as a betrayal. Ultimately, the desire for political correctness led everyone to abandon basic ethical principles during the revolution, unleashing the unchecked violence of human nature. In this atmosphere, any attempt to maintain a moral conscience was risky and could be labeled evil.\n\nDue to this stifling environment, many good people were forced to relinquish their moral compass and commit crimes during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, as many similar movements showed, the irrational passions fueling the Revolution were unsustainable. Once everything was destroyed, a sense of emptiness prevailed, eventually leading to a return to peace.\n\nThe intense conflict between pro-Mao and anti-Mao factions had largely subsided by 1968. To address the large number of urban students with pent-up energy, Mao promoted a program to send them to the countryside. Roughly 16 million students were mandatorily resettled between 1968 and 1978.\n\nBoth the earlier conflict and the subsequent resettlement were nationwide phenomena, though primarily concentrated in large cities. These densely populated areas provided more people to be involved and more targets to be attacked. When surrounded by a large crowd, herd mentality can be significantly magnified.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of the Cultural Revolution's background, Roderick MacFarquhar's three-volume work, *The Origins of the Cultural Revolution*, is an excellent resource.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, books mentioned by Kubly can provide insights into the daily lives of people during the Revolution from 1966 to 1976.",

            "This is a pretty huge topic, and I've been out of academia long enough to not feel comfortable answering it, however I do have some book recommendations if you'd like to learn more. \n\nWild Swans, by Jung Chang. A family history by the author, which covers a lot of the 20th century including the cultural revolution and gives great context to it. The author herself was a red guard, but her parents were also targeted and her father was tortured due to criticisms of the movement, and she was later sent to the countryside for education and thought reform  You get a broad picture of things from her experiences.\n\nBorn Red, by Yuan Gao. This is a chronicle of the author's experiences during the cultural revolution but with place and people names changed to protect identities. It deals with a lot of the questions you ask in the post as he was a student during this period. It really gets into the details of local politics and the murkiness of who is \"pro-mao\" and \"anti-mao\" as you put it.\n\nBalzac and the little Chinese Seamstress, by Dai Sijie. This is fiction based in part on the author's experiences. It gives a look into the experience of being at a reeducation-through-labor camp and the influence of foreign literature during the time period. A fun read, and there's also a movie from the early 2000s so it's probably the most digestible of these three, but also covers the least ground on the topic \n\nI recognize suggesting you read an entire book or three kind of defeats the purpose of posting here, and I hope someone more knowledgeable can provide a good answer. That said, the cultural revolution has a lot of complexity and nuance, much of it based distinctly in Chinese culture and history, and China's unique experience of communism. I think it's very helpful to have the perspective of someone who has lived in that environment, and so memoirs like these are really educational.",

            "I\u2019ve read Wild Swans, and the biography of Mao, by the same author (plus her husband Jon Halliday) between the two I felt I had a relatively 360 degree view the second book appeared to be very deeply researched BUT I am aware that I am dependent on one author, so I would be interested in any view on Jung Chang/Jon Halliday. Are those books considered reliable perspectives by the academic community?\n\n(Reposting as a reply because I accidentally posted as a reply to the main question - hope this doesn\u2019t appear spammy!)"
