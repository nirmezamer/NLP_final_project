            "Just wanted to say I absolutely loved this movie! I appreciate how it stars an actual 93 yr old actress and uses her abilities well instead of hiring a younger actress, using prosthetics to age her and making her do Tom Cruise level stunts.\n\n Its a limited release currently I was wondering if it will expand to some more theaters next week?  Also I read that June was always the #1 choice for Thelma, Was Richard Roundtree always the #1 choice for Ben?",
            "Will you convince the Academy to have June announce the Oscar for best stunt performance?",
            "how did you find balance between the comedy and the sincerity? Both came off so genuine throughout the film and I feel like that can be tough to juggle",
            "In real life, did Tom Cruise/Mission: Impossible - Fallout really inspire your grandmother to do what she did? Or did it just inspire you creatively while writing the story?",
            "What a fantastic movie!  My favourite relationship in the movie is between June and Fred.  Besides your (Josh's) relationship with your grandmother, have you seen such sweet, doting grandparent/grandchild relationships IRL?  Most portrayals of teens and young adults in TV and movies tend to show the younger generation as being surly or self-obsessed, and never this loving to their elders.",
            "I saw the movie this week and loved it - congrats to the whole team. Definitely brought back memories of my dearly departed lola.\n\nSo where can we get those June Squibb hats?",
            "Hey guys, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is my favorite action movie and I knew I was in for a ride the moment I saw it featured in your film! Were Josh and his grandmother inspired by Fallout in real life?\n\nThanks for doing this. I absolutely loved the film. Best comedy of the year!",
            "If there was one fact about this film you'd want audiences to know before they saw it, what would it be?",
            "HI!  I loved the movie.  I attended the Q&A at NYC Lincoln Square last week and was wondering how you, ~~Jeff~~ Josh (sorry!), June and Q&A moderator knew Beanie Feldstein prior to the movie and if she had any other part in the movie beyond passing on the script?\n\nAnd was it difficult to insure the movie given the cast?",
            "What was it like working with june squibb and if this film becoms successful do you think you could make a spinoff"

And my God, it was mind blowing.\n\nEven though it's filled with Nolan's signature time jumping, you can still follow the story without questioning that, because it's so well paced and directed. The tricks, rivalry and mystery is constantly engaging.\n\nAnd then Nolan pulls it off with a magic trick deluxe of an ending. The set-up and hints are there, and it ends up bigger than you think.\n\nI don't know what else to say. My brain is soup now. Straight up soup. Just an amazing 6/6 movie.",

But a 3 hour run time for a movie that doesn't resolve any plot points, and potentially won't in the next movie either, feels like hubris. It sucks because I want him to be able to make all 4 movies, but I have an incentive to wait for it on streaming because they're long as hell, and I'm hesitant to invest the time into it because there's a good chance the first two movies will bomb and there won't be any resolution to the story.",
