        "content": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nHi, r/movies! I\u2019m Ariane Louis-Seize, the screenwriter and director of *Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person*. It's an award-winning, French-Canadian coming-of-age vampire film that's been charming audiences at festivals worldwide, including TIFF and Venice, and has won numerous awards. It's hitting theaters nationwide this week. I'm here to answer all your questions about the film, my journey, and anything else you're curious about! AMA!\n\n**Logline:**  \nSasha is a young vampire with a very serious problem: she\u2019s too sensitive to kill! Frustrated by their daughter\u2019s empathy for humans, Sasha\u2019s parents decide to cut off her blood supply to force her to learn how to hunt\u2026 or starve! Just as she decides to reject her vampire instincts and embrace a final death, she meets a lonely teenager named Paul who is willing to give his life to save hers, on the condition that she help fulfill his final wishes before day breaks.\n\n**Watch the Trailer:**  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Ox75fXY7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Ox75fXY7o)\n\n**Release Date:**  \nHumanist Vampire opens in NY and LA theaters today, followed by a nationwide theatrical rollout!\n\n**Edit: I\u2019m logging off now to get ready for the film\u2019s NYC premiere!

            "Ariane will be answering questions an hour or two after this post goes live (so around 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM Eastern). Please ask away :)",
            "This movie looks fantastic, can't wait to see it!\n\nWe've been watching and reading vampire stories for centuries now, why do you personally think that the concept has such staying power with audiences?\n\nAlso, were there any established vampire \"tropes\" that you were consciously avoiding when making the film? Any specific ones you wanted to honor/homage with the film?",
            "Allo Ariane!\n\nI absolutely loved the movie at TIFF last year, one of my favorites of the festivals. It was super charming/bloody/sweet/hilarious. A really unique mix. Looking forward to catching it again soon for its full release, hopefully in a theater.\n\nThere's one scene in particular that I really loved and couldn't stop thinking about, when Sasha and Paul are listening to the music together that reminded me so much of the [Listening Booth Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkRuHhhYAqg&ab_channel=VivekYadav) from **Before Sunrise**, one of my all-time favorite scenes. Was this intended? I've been hoping it was lol.\n\nIf not, were there other films that you used as influences for **Humanist Vampire**?",
            "Hello!\n\nWhat are some of your most favorite coming of age films? And what about them stands out to you?",
            "Ariane! I loved HVSCSP!! It was so much fun and a superb joy to watch! Feel free to answer 0-all of these:\n\n1. How did the idea/subject matter come about for the film?\n2. How did you convince your producers to keep the super long title (that's surprisingly shorter in French!)\n3. What sold you about Sara and Felix-Antoine during the casting process that they would be PERFECT for their roles?\n4. What did you find most fun and most challenging in making your first feature?\n5. Are you related to French royalty?!\n\nP.S. I loved the set design of the cousin's place! Kudos to the designer(s)!\n\nCongrats on all the award wins and nominations for your debut feature!!",
            "What's your favourite vampire movie/s if you have any?",
            "Humanist Vampire was a lot of fun!  \n  \nAre you working on anything at the moment? Any plans for your next feature?",
            "Who are your favourite directors? Who inspired you to be a director?",
            "Was Armin Meiwes, the German cannibal who only wanted consenting victims, part of the inspiration?",
            "Congrats on making one of the most beautiful films I\u2019ve seen in a while! Can you tell me a bit about how you developed your vision for the film\u2019s cinematography? Your cinematographer has a new fan in me!",
            "Je n\u2019ai pas vraiment de question autre que de te f\u00e9liciter pour le film! Je te souhaite le meilleur des succ\u00e8s!",
            "Hello, *Humanist Vampire* was one of the best films I saw last year and I loved how you managed to unpacked a hilariously ironic/absurd premise to its fullest implications with so much heart. During my viewing, what struck me the most was how Sasha's story works so, so well as a metaphor or allegory for so many situations--from the obvious (like ethical debates about eating meat) to the abstract (e.g. coming out of the closet)--that it made your film feel at once intimate and universal. Thank you for this all-Canadian gem!\n\nCan you elaborate a bit more on the writing process for *Humanist Vampire*, and how you brought it from initial idea to final script? Were there any ideas or scenes that had to be cut that you wish could've made their way to the final product? Did you have any particular themes or motifs in mind that guided your story development?",
            "I don't have any questions, but fellow Canadian here who got to see this a while back on Crave (twice because I liked it so much, I watched it again right away).  This movie was an absolute delight, an awkward outsider coming of age / meet cute with a slightly dark twisty angle.  And also a fresh take on vampires as well with some unique lore!  I've been talking it up to everyone I know.  It's currently sitting in my top ten of ranked list of Vampire films in my Letterboxd so you done good in my books! We don't get a lot of Canadian Vampire movies so I was excited and appreciative of your entry to the genre.\n\n(PS I'm also learning French - thought this would be a fun one to practice with and it was!  It was really accessible for a language learner).",
            "Just FWIW, absolutely LOVE this film, now desperately hoping it gets (amongst a wider distribution and appreciation) UK theatrical distribution and broader pickup/distribution so that I can get a physical copy of it on Blu Ray domestically; the import fees from Canada or Australia (weirdly) just astronomical!",
            "Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA with us.\n\nWhat's your dream project? And which actor do you want to work with the most?",
            "Okay wait to be so real with you I\u2019ve never been a fan of vampire movies but after reading just the description I think it sounds fantastic! Definitely worth a watch I think",
            "Sara Montpetit seemed like the perfect casting for a teenage vampire! What went into that casting decision and what would be some projects you'd like to collaborate on together in the future?",
            "[removed]",
            "I just want to say, I saw this earlier this year at the Lightbox and loved it. Can\u2019t wait to see what you work on next!",
            "Wow I saw the trailer months ago and thought it looked fantastic!  I don\u2019t even like Vampire films but this just seemed so compelling and well done.  Will definitely be projecting it in my own personal screening room.  My GF is an actress from Transylvania, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll enjoy it as well.\n\nPerhaps you can tell us how you got it produced?",
            "I was at the world premiere screening at TIFF, I saw it again at CIFF/ Eau Claire. Congrats!",
            "Hi, could you tell me a bit more about the movie? \n\nE.g. plot, characters, cast",
            "Hey! Thank you so much! To answer your first question, I think the world of vampires is an incredible playground to discuss our relationship with death, others, and the society we live in. Vampires are fascinating because they are both attractive and dangerous, and personally, I love playing in areas where attraction and repulsion meet. I also love misfits. The vampire story always evolves because the society around us evolves.\n\nFor your second question, the only vampire trope that I decided to change is that my vampires age! They age more slowly than humans, but I really wanted the character of Shasha to experience childhood to establish her childhood trauma.",
            "Hey! Thank you for your question and your kind words! I'm sorry to disappoint you, but no, it wasn't a reference to *Before Sunrise*, which I agree is a brilliant film! It is the scene that I am most proud of in my film though. The films that have influenced me the most in making my movie are *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*, *Only Lovers Left Alive*, and *Under the Skin*!",
            "My favorite coming-of-age films that come to mind are: *Juno*, *Garden State*, *Little Miss Sunshine*, and *Harold and Maude*. These are films I watched when I was a teenager, and as a little weirdo myself, I related to those characters because they are weird, surprising, vulnerable, and so lovable. More recently, I love *How to Have Sex* and *Bottoms*, obviously for very different reasons! *How to Have Sex* is a brilliant and important film about rape culture, and *Bottoms* is just a joy to watch with the most amazing cast!",
            "I\u2019m running out of time to answer everyone, so I\u2019ll pick two of your questions: \n\n3.What sold me on Sara and F\u00e9lix-Antoine:\n\nI was sold on both of them individually pretty early on in the casting process, as you can imagine! But what remained to be confirmed was their chemistry together. \n\nThe final step of the process was to have them act out one of the scenes together (the \u201cEmotions\u201d scene!). It was so beautifully awkward - they had both come very prepared, but had approached the scene so differently, that it created a lot of clumsy, awkward moments - which is exactly what I wanted! Funny enough, both actors thought they completely bombed the audition, but I begged to differ :) \n\n[5.Am](http://5.Am) I related to French royalty: \n\nAbsolutely not! In fact, when I travel to France, people get a good laugh out of my surname, which has long disappeared over there but is still somewhat prevalent in Quebec!",
            "My favorite vampire films are *The Hunger*, *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*, and *Only Lovers Left Alive*. I also want to add *Under the Skin-*it's not a vampire film, but it inspired me a lot during my creative process.",
            "Thanks for watching!\n\nI\u2019m working on too many things! I have another feature I\u2019m developing in French, an adaptation of a play by a wonderful playwright named Rebecca Deraspe. In the US, I\u2019ve got a few things in the works, including my first English language feature, which is a complete departure from the universe of Humanist Vampire! I also see some TV in my future\u2026 stay tuned!",
            "I'm a big David Lynch and Jane Campion fan! *Mulholland Drive* is the film that made me fall in love with cinema as an art form. It's a challenging film, but it is so unique. I love dreamlike worlds and the combination of tension, emotional scenes, dark humor, and colorful, odd characters. My favorite film by Jane Campion is *Sweetie*, her first feature, which has such a distinctive tone and deeply moving characters!",
            "Great question! No, he wasn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t know about him until after the film was released and people started asking me this very question!",
            "Ohhhh, thank you so much! :) I'll pass your kind words to Shawn Pavlin, the cinematographer! I've been working with him since my first short film, so we have great chemistry and have really developed our visual aesthetic together through all of our projects. Before starting this specific project, we watched a bunch of vampire films to spark our inspiration.",
            "Cheers for the kind words :)",
            "Argh, I\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t have an answer for you right now but I\u2019m forwarding your question to people who might!",
            "Ouuuhhhh, my dream project! That's a tough one! I think my dream project would be to make a very wild musical! And there are so many actors I want to work with! It's impossible to choose just one, but let's say: Mark Ruffalo and Ayo Edebiri!",
            "I love reading that!\u00a0\u00a0I really set out to make a vampire film that would appeal to a broader audience than just vampire fans!\u00a0\u00a0In my humble opinion, I think fans of many different genres will be able to relate to Sacha and Paul\u2019s humanity (so to speak!) and their quest for meaning. The film also borrows a lot of other universes - coming of age and dark comedy being two of them. \n\nI hope you enjoy it!",
            "I agree with you, she was perfect for this role! I was already a fan of hers and had especially enjoyed watching her in Charlotte Le Bon\u2019s FALCON LAKE, and I thought she had such a beautiful, mysteriously vampiric aura to her! It was a very easy casting decision! \n\nAs for future collaboration with Sara, while there\u2019s nothing concrete right now,\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t wait to find an opportunity to work with her again, and something tells me it won\u2019t take too long before that happens!",
            "<3",
            "If you\u2019re in NYC or LA, go see it in theatres, and go in blind!\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019ll be more fun that way!\n\nIf you\u2019re elsewhere in the US, there\u2019s a wider release coming. I hope you enjoy it :)",
            "Did anyone ask you whether [the episode of *The IT Crowd*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOE-q20RcDM) was an inspiration?",
            "I was genuinely not expecting an acknowledgement or response. Wow. Thank you so much (just for the response!) and very best with the films continued success.",
            "That's exciting! Can't wait to see more from you both!",
            "Never!",
            "Thank you <3"

The movie is genius, and I feel like more people should watch it. I don\u2019t see it on many peoples list.\n\nI\u2019m curious, did Linda Fiorentino stop acting because of her connection with the Pellicano case? Was she effectively blacklisted because of it? She\u2019s such a terrific actress, and I feel like the film industry lost someone who could\u2019ve really contributed to filmmaking. Her voice is definitely missing in movies today.\n\nHer characters in The Last Seduction as well as in Men in Black were really interesting\u2014characters you don\u2019t see on screen anymore. They had entire arcs and were just damn confident, clever and smoking hot. That last scene  in Men in Black when she\u2019s holding the gun, after killing the bug, wearing the skirt and button up blouse. As a 12-year-old I was like,  \u201cshe makes this look good!\u201d \ud83d\ude0e\n\nIt\u2019s wild what an actor can do with a character on screen. ",

The other big elephant in the room is just the fact that the way Hollywood markets stuff (hopefully less so today, but certainly in the early '00s when roles seemed to dry up for her) there are far fewer meaningful roles made available for actresses who aren't \"young\" anymore. A lot of other actresses have spoken about this over the years, too, that in that gap when you're not \"young\" enough to play the leading man's girlfriend anymore but not \"old\" enough to play his mother yet there just aren't many decent roles available, and there are a lot of great talents all competing for those few roles.",

One of the things he said is that the movie would\u2019ve been better if Janine Garofalo played the lead character instead of her smaller supporting role \u2014 and he\u2019s probably right. But some years later, he made a public apology and that it was \u201ca really shitty and stupid thing to say.\u201d He also said they had amicably reconnected years later.\n\nThe Men in Black 2 thing is also misleading. Her role was written out so that Tommy Lee Jones could return to be Will Smith\u2019s partner again. If you recall, the first film ended with Jones\u2019s character retiring and Fiorentino becoming his new partner, but they preferred to have Tommy Lee Jones come back as a co-lead instead, and there was no room in the story for her character anymore.\n\nFiorentino was associated with Harvey Weinstein who mistreated and blacklisted many female actresses. I don\u2019t know that we have proof that he derailed her career as well, but she DID say in one interview in the 90s that she\u2019s already suffered though sexual harassment with other producers and didn\u2019t enjoy being a part of the industry for that reason, and had tried to leave earlier and was only taking on roles to take a living. Think about this the next time you hear an actress being described as \u201cdifficult\u201d.\n\nI honestly think she just simply got fed up with Hollywood, maybe she was mistreated one too many times and decided she didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore. Even unlikable actors can still find roles in independent films, but she flat out chose not to take any more roles at all. I honestly think her retirement is entirely her own choice.",

Bruce Willis is a respected actor and probably signed up to play the character in a particular way, and Smith was basically telling him to stop doing that and just re-do a different role he already had done before. He also took offense when Willis called him out for not understanding or caring about the technical aspect of filmmaking, and mocked him for that, too.\n\nBeing game to parody yourself is one thing (and Willis did that several times before), but to be explicitly told to just recreate a role he no longer wanted to revisit at that time is pretty ballsy, especially coming from a director who seemed unprofessional and incompetent in Willis\u2019s eyes.

        "content": "Let me preface this by saying that I love Christopher Nolan. To me, he's one of the best directors/movie makers, and up until recently, I considered him my #1. Until Dunkirk. It was his first movie after Interstellar, which was (again, in my opinion) a masterpiece. I remember seeing it in IMAX 70mm and had the most unexplainable movie experience of my life. I was silently sobbing by the end of it.\n\nAnd that was after Inception and Dark Knight! So when Dunkirk came out, I had very high expectations, because his films always met those expectations and surpassed them. I remember noticing that his brother wasn't a part of writing it, but I didn't pay much attention to that fact... until I saw the film. Honestly, I considered it a disappointment. It was nothing like his last few movies before it, and it barely impacted me. I thought it was lacking some kind of magic that his films always had. \n\nI was happier with Tenet, and I think that the concept and a lot of the scenes were absolutely amazing! But, again, something about the film was lacking to me. It just didn't hit its mark. It wasn't what I had come to expect from Nolan's films. It didn't have the same heart and execution in its story, and I felt that missing from most scenes. Robert Pattinson was the best part of the movie for me because it's like he got it and he gave it. \n\nThat's when I started to realize that Jonathan Nolan was what was missing. I was giving all the credit to Christopher by considering him my #1 and thinking of Jonathan as only 'helping' him with the scripts. I may be wrong, but I think he was integral to the masterpieces that the films were when they were making them together.\n\nOppenheimer was obviously a fantastic movie, but to me, it was still missing the magic that I'd come to expect from Christpher Nolan. I don't know how else to explain it. There used to be this kind of electricity, heart, and soul. I'm not saying that I think those things were missing entirely, obviously not! Just that I think they were incomplete, and I think it's because he's been making his films without Jonathan for a decade now.\n\nThe writing of Westworld season 1 was like the TV version of what I was missing after Interstellar, especially the writing. I think that Christopher is a master director/filmmaker. But I think he writes great films, not masterpieces. Jonathan IS that missing piece. \n\nI'm not exactly sure why they parted ways, but I hope that they plan to make more films together in the future.\n\nEdit to add: I think that Christopher Nolan fans fall into 2 categories. Those who prefer his films pre-2014 and those who prefer his films post 2014. I want to emphasize that I'm not saying that one side is right or wrong. Just my own opinions. Cinema is about personal preference after all. \n\nEdit again to add: Welp, I don't know how I missed that Chrisophet Nolan wrote all of Inception, which I consider a masterpiece.",

            "Hard agree. I actually didn't know that about the brother's influence. Like you, I thought Dunkirk, Tenet and Oppenheimer were all great films in a technical sense and intellectually but they lacked character stuff. Especially Tenet was let down by the (lack of meaningful) relationships between the characters, which was a shame because it had such an interesting take on time travel (sorry I mean reverse entropy lol). It's like the director spent 10 years on the concept and 10 minutes on whatever role Elizabeth Debicki's character was supposed to play (did you know she was a mother, did you know she saw everything through the lens of her child?)",

I think you\u2019re onto something that the earlier films were more character driven and there was lots of quality to be found there, but if we\u2019re hyping up Jonathan\u2019s contribution to the writing, we have to also hold him accountable for the writing shortfalls, and there are plenty. I\u2019m not saying Chris Nolan isn\u2019t a genius film maker, but each of his masterpieces is flawed in some way, and all of those ways involve the writing. The over-exposition, missed opportunities and multiple magic beans of Inception is a good example. (Still a great movie in many ways)\n\nAs for Jonathan\u2019s other work (Lisa Joy, too), on one hand I watched Westworld fly off the tracks and the other hand, they seem to be nailing Fallout. \n\nI value both brothers as creators, but it seems both have consistent weak spots in their work.",

            "I literally said the same thing to my wife a couple of years ago.\n\nJonathan brought the heart to the projects,  without it it feels very good technically  but empty.\n\nDunkirk and Tenet are great examples.\n\nBoth are great technically but tell me the name of 1 character..... and for tenet it's actually worse , the protagonist  is\n.. protagonist. \n\nStill love Nolan but I really hope he does another movie with his brother  writing.",
            "Absolutely agree. It pisses me off that they don\u2019t work together because when they do, they make MAGIC. Without Jonathan i haven\u2019t liked anything Nolan has made. Not even a little.",
            "Don't know why, but for me Memento, Inception, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are his best movies. \n\nAlso I wouldn't compare movies to tv series. Possibilities are so different.",
            ">I was happier with Tenet\n\nMade me doubt on being dissapointed with Dunkirk, but absolutely lost me there.",
            "Dunkirk is a fantastic movie. One of, if not his best l. Interstellar was half of an interesting movie with some great ideas. Tenet was absolute crap. Idk how you can look at Dunkirk and claim it's anything but phenomenal or use it as evidence of his downfall..",
            "Wow. Dunkirk is a masterpiece. It\u2019s amazing story telling.\u00a0",
            "Agreed but have you seen fallout? Never played the games but Jonathan nailed it. Some of the best, most immersive sci fi I\u2019ve seen in recent memory.\u00a0",
            "I think I agree, but I also think it\u2019s ironic because I think Jonathan and Lisa\u2019s stuff is really lacking something. After the first Westworld season, the later seasons all kind of fell apart under the weight of their own cleverness and self-seriousness. Peripheral was similar in that it was really compelling at first and then the season finale was so disappointing to me that I had no interest in the next season and didn\u2019t care when it was canceled. And we got bored with Fallout somewhere around episode 4. Maybe the thing his stuff is missing is Christopher, maybe they need each other.",
            "I disagree about Dunkirk. It\u2019s one of hist best movies.  \n\nI really wanted to like Tenant, but I wasn\u2019t convinced that Branagh\u2019s character was a mastermind and the threat wasn\u2019t very clear. \n\nI do enjoy the sense of wonder from his science fiction movies though and his use of mind bending special effects, so I understand what you mean. \n\nI would love to see him do a Robopocalypse movie.",
            "Wasn't Jonathan Nolan the one who really wanted Catwoman aka Selina Kyle to be in Dark Knight Rises? Not complaining, but I can see why Jonathan needs to be there.\u00a0",
            "People need to realize when Christopher directs a movie without his brother involved, he's the *sole* director and writer usually. Jonathan's TV stuff is done with multiple writers",
            "His only movies I consider incredible are both Oppenheimer and Dunkirk. \u00a0I think Dunkirk is incomparable and genuinely a 10/10. Hope he continues without him",
            "I've started watching Oppenheimer twice and find it really boring, its just people talking.  After about 35 minutes I get bored and do something else.  His other films, once I start watching them, I can't stop until they've finished.",
            "Did you post this before? Having some crazy deja-vu here",
            "Tenet was a turd but I don\u2019t get how anyone can hate on Dunkirk. It is a masterpiece.",

            "The only thing that Christopher Nolan's films are missing is clear dialogue.\u00a0",
            "Nolan only has three films that were nominated for the most prestigious award categories. Inception, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer. Those are three films that Nolan has sole screenwriting credit for. So it's unlikely that Nolan himself would agree with you that he needs his brother to help him with his screenplays.\n\nAlso it's a shame Dunkirk didn't land for you. It's probably his most accomplished film. And I don't mean that from a technical standpoint.",
            "Eh I wish I liked INTERSTELLAR. So many little things like that awkward moving robot that was supposed to be the comic relief I guess? Wes Bently death being a YOINK right as he enters the ship? The guy left behind on the ship for 20 years has a little Grey hair instead of just being played be a different older actor?",
            "so overrated.   \n\nhis Batman movies are legendary, but the 3rd act in all 3 can suck my asshole.",
            "Love Nolan. Past two movies have fallen below his standards in my opinion. I was disappointed in Oppenheimer because that story is far more interesting than the movie. I read an American Prometheus a few years before and in my opinion the story fell is bit short.\u00a0\nI totally understand that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s opinion though.",
            "I didn't realize this until you posted this, but yeah I totally agree with you.",
            "Sorry but Oppenheimer was outstanding. I agree about Dunkirk. Disagree about Tenet. It was classic Inception-Interstellar Nolan. If anything, Oppenheimer and Dunkirk were sort of departures, with Oppenheimer still being a masterpiece largely due to the fact that both Cillian Murphy and R Downey Jr. were perfectly cast with a tremendous script.",
            "Inception & the Dark Knight are perfection. \n\nWith Interstellar, I felt the movie was bursting at the seams but still entertaining.\n\nEveryone talks about the cool concept of time in Dunkirk. Nothing about the heart of the story and I doubt most people can even remember the characters.\n\nTenet was confusing, had a few cool moments, but was heartless. The final \"battle\" looked ridiculous.\n\nI haven't gotten around to Oppenheimer yet.",
            "Tenet is a borderline masterpiece from Nolan. To be fair, I didn't quite get it the first time viewing it and had to have subtitles on to understand what the characters were saying. Tenet is Nolan's James Bond spy thriller with a twist. After watching some YouTube videos with 3D representations and explanations of the concept of reverse entropy, the whole concept of the movie blew me away.",
            "Surprisingly, I prefer Oppenheimer to his other films specifically because of its script! The characters were more fleshed out than the previous scripts on his films. Of course, I love the Dark Knight. But Oppenheimer is genuinely that one film that I prefer to his other films in general.",
            "Nolan started to unravel with Dark Knight Rises. It is an absolute mess of a movie that rides on the triumph of its 2 predecessors within the Nolan trilogy.",
            "I much prefer his stuff without Jonathan. I feel like Jonathan brings out his worst tendencies and generally brings down the film into genre fare",
            "They need each other, Jon keeps tanking projects to retell Person of Interest",
            "You may be onto something although since 2014 he has been doing quite different films. Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are nothing like anything he's done before so maybe Jonathan wouldn't have made a difference. And I think (while not his best) they are both very good. \n\nTenet is the best comparison point. It's easily his worst film. But I can't tell if it's a hot mess because Jonathan was missing or not. Let's not forget The Dark Knight Rises was not good. And Jonathan was involved in that.",
            "There\u2019s a scene in Blade that matched the dark knights scene, actually two of them. In blade, Blade throws a person across two buildings, TDK zip lines between buildings.\n\nThen there\u2019s a mob scene in Blade that doesn\u2019t look anything like the pencil scene in TDK but it feels the exact same. \n\nWas this Jona or the other guy? (Forgetting his name I\u2019m sorry)",
            "Nolan has the same issues as George Lucas. Great director, shitty writer.",
            "Christopher Nolan's movies are only good for one watch (for me), I can't stomach the rigidity. \nI think he's an amazing director. But the only movie I've been able to watch more than once by him is the dark knight.\n\nI have similar feelings to Denis Villeneuve  - but it's not rigidity. It's the emotional momentum, sometimes it just doesn't exist. And the films feel like a spectacle and nothing else, again, think he's an amazing director. \n\nHis films don't hit the same on the 2nd run, and personally I thought dune was only aesthetic. And quite frankly his worst movies.\n\nSomeone's films who I think have great rewatch capacity are S.Craig Zahlers movies (though very few).\n\nAnd I will say that maybe he's not as technically good as the aforementioned but he knows how to create emotional crescendos - usually very violent and stressful ones. His movies evoke distress, and any film that makes me feel anything is doing a fantastic job imo.\n\n\nAnother is Park-chan wook  for very similar reasons to Zahler.\n\nBut also he is  technically masterful.",
            "Nope. Jon's other shows have been mediocre",
            "Genuinely surprised by how many people in here think Dunkirk is his masterpiece. I found it to be a pretty by the books war movie that didn\u2019t bring anything new to the genre.",
            "I disagree completely with pretty much everything said here. Oppenheimer is probably the best script that Nolan has ever written. Obviously it\u2019s all personal taste but looking back on his career, late period Nolan has far surpassed his early stuff for me. Tenet, Oppenheimer, and Dunkirk are all top 5 for me. The Dark Knight is a classic and obviously what made him a household name, but Inception does not hold up for me beyond the impact it had when it released in 2010; Batman Begins is fine, TDKR is a mess, and the The Prestige and Insomniac are fun but a little bumpy. Memento is a classic.\n\nI think Jonathan Nolan\u2019s output since their creative divorce kind of reinforces my feelings that he really didn\u2019t have much to do with Nolan\u2019s success. I stopped westworld around season 2 because it became unbearable, and while people seem to enjoy Fallout, I cannot stand it. I hope the lesser Nolan figures it out, but Oppenheimer really made me doubly excited for Christopher Nolan\u2019s ongoing solo career",
            "I feel like the cold and clinical aspect played well into Oppenheimers tone as a film as well. I definitely would have liked it less if there was more \u201cpizaz\u201d to it",
            "I agree. I always thought it was Chrisopher who brought the soul to the movies so it took me time to really see that it wasn't because I didn't want to believe otherwise. But it also made me feel like Jonathan isn't given enough credit by audiences because I think that a lot of us just thought he was kind of helping out in his brother's movies rather than being a crucial piece.",
            "Emotion. Feeling. Christopher has none of that. Compare that with Fallout and Westworld and you see what is missing. I haven't cared about a character in any of Christopher's movies since.",
            "Well put. Even with Inception, Leo spent a lot of time ensuring that the movie included a lot of heart and emotion. Watching Tenet is as helped to fully contextualize that point",
            "The heart of tenet is the bromance between JW Washington and Pattinson though, not debicki",
            "Absolutely I agree with you!",
            "That movie IS amazing! I still prefer Interstellar, but that's just my opinion!",
            "Aww, thank you for your kind response! In glad I could help you articulate the feeling. Honestly, it took me a while to do it myself!",
            "I totally respect your opinion. I definitely think it was fantastic. And the last line of the film has stuck with me for a year. But I still felt it was missing some things. I think he could've pushed the limit or done more, especially considering the subject, if that makes sense?",
            "I was just going to say the same thing. I saw this exact post a week ago, lol.",
            "It might've been me! My post was deleted with no explanation less than an hour after I posted it. So I tried posting it again tonight.\u00a0",
            "And then someone else will do it, and in that thread someone else will and eventually the top keeps spinning",
            "I assume Jonathan\u2019s stock in the industry reached a point where he could branch off on his own and chose to do so. It\u2019s great when you a collaborative pair work so well together and it sucks when they split up to do solo stuff, but it can be understandable when both probably have very specific visions for projects they want to do on their own.\n\nChuck Russell and Frank Darabont were an amazing partnership for horror in the 80s with their work on Hell Night, Dream Warriors, and The Blob, but Darabont wanted to move on and gave us Shawshank Redemption.\n\nDon Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer basically reinvented the wheel when it came to action movies in the 80s, but Simpson\u2019s drug use resulted in their partnership breaking down during production of The Rock and he died before it was completed. Bruckheimer still made big hits, but Simpson\u2019s eccentricity was noticeably missing. \n\nBruckheimer and Michael Bay is another one. Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and Bad Boys 2 show how their styles just worked so well together, and most things they\u2019ve done separately since 2002 really haven\u2019t been the same. For Bruckheimer, National Treasure 1 & 2 and the first Pirates were great, and for Bay, Pain & Gain felt like 1993 Michael Bay, but most everything else has been lacking in one way or the other.\n\nFor the Nolans, I think Jonathan saw a chance to start overseeing productions and took it. Christopher used it as an opportunity to fully realize his own visions. I think when they worked together, they played to their strengths. Jonathan is a much better writer while Christopher has a top 1% director\u2019s mind. I hope they work together again soon.",
            "I have no idea. But honestly I haven't looked it up. I have a twin sister that I'm very close with and we're movie buffs with the same pov on everything. We've always wanted to be actresses and make movies together so it makes me sad that they stopped making movies together. Hopefully they just wanted to make some projects apart (hopefully not permanently) and split amicably.",
            "Jonathan got too big. He also kind of traded Christopher for his wife who he worked on Westworld and Fallout with. That, and they signed their own deal with Amazon. He doesn't really have time for Christopher anymore.\n\nChristopher did say he shows Jonathan his scripts and gets feedback on them. He said he wrote Oppenheimer in the downstairs of a house during COVID while Jonah was writing upstairs.",
            "> The over-exposition, missed opportunities and multiple magic beans of Inception is a good example. (Still a great movie in many ways)\n\nJonathan did not work on Inception.",
            "It's funny that you should say that, because Inception was also not (co) written by Jonathan.",
            "I agree. But he used to be my #1. Dennis Villenue is now my #1 and Chris Nolan is my #2. That can always change, I still have hope!",
            "That's a good point! That could be part of it. I don't know.",
            "I still haven't seen Oppenheimer but I love love Dunkirk. I appreciate so much kore after rewatching years after release.",
            "I completely agree with you. My twin sister and I have been discussing this the last few years because he's always been our #1 but right now he's our #2. That can always change though!",
            "Lol! I respect that. I really loved the idea of Tenet but I was dissapointed in the execution and the characters. It was also lacking the heart. I like it less ob my second viewing. But I still loved the idea, some of its message,\u00a0 and the directing.\n\n\nIt was the skeleton of a masterpiece and a reminder of what could've/should've been.",
            ">Idk how you can look at Dunkirk and claim it's anything but phenomenal or use it as evidence of his downfall..\n\nI absolutely love Dunkirk but it's understandable that it was divisive among Nolan fans. If it doesn't immediately grab you with it's simple premise of survival then there isn't much to draw you in. That intense 2 hours you spent in the theatre was two hours of tedious noise for those that didn't click with the film.",
            "I really enjoyed Fallout and I hear that game fans were very pleased!",
            "Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but didn't Lisa Joy kind of take over for the later seasons of Westworld and Jonathan took a step back? I remember seeing that in a behind the scenes making of the future seasons.\n\n\nI don't think that Jonathan Nolan didn't write or direct any of the episodes of Peripheral.\n\n\nI'm sorry you didn't enjoy Fallout. I really did.\u00a0\n\n\nI do really agree that they need eachother.",
            "I totally respect your opinion!\u00a0\n\n\nI agree with the rest of your comment :)\n\n\nBranagh is a great actor but I don't think that his character was layered enough.\u00a0",
            "Man Tenant was straight trash. Half of the dialogue is total inaudible, and the whole climax is guys screaming at each other while dangling a giant MacGuffin over a hole. That isn't just bad writing, it is borderline intentionally bad writing. Like to parody and mock a bad action flick I would just cut the scene straight out of the movie and put it in a sketch show like SNL",
            "Tenet sounded interesting in the first previews, but it's like it falls flat when you finally see the movie. Several of Nolan's movies have some plot problems but not to the extent that it ruins the movies (always hated the skiing scenes in Inception but it's  more the set than the plot that irritates).\n\nI wonder what the most credible \"mind fuck\" movies are? Google suggest Primer, Mullholland Drive and 2001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0",
            "I didn't know that! I will say that I think Christopher's three newer films are lacking in the female characters area. Not saying he doesn't have female characters in his movies, just that there lacking a certain something that makes me relate to them as a woman. Elizabeth Debicki's character in Tenet is the first that comes to my mind. And I dont count Oppenheimer because it's a historical movie so he didn't exactly write the female characters.\u00a0",
            "Facts. I saw Oppenheimer in theaters and i was fidgeting the whole time. And I\u2019m somebody who LOVES movies. Oppenheimer just did not work for me at all",
            "I did, last week. But it was removed (no reason given) within an hour of my posting it.",
            "I agree that I think they need eachother! They both make amazing projects separately but make masterpieces together (in my opinion, not stating a fact)!\n\n\nEdit to add: I don't think that Jonathan is doing a bad job at all on his own.\u00a0",
            "Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are like nothing he's done before. Because he always made more sc-fi ish type stuff, or just fiction in general. I thought they were great movies too, just not masterpieces. But I don't necessarily think anyone else could've made them better if they were the director/writer. It's just that I think his movies have become colder, more analytical, and are lacking that last level of heart/soul and spark.\u00a0\n\n\nControversial opinion, but I absolutely loved DKR.",
            "I have to disagree. I don't think he's a shitty writer by any means. Dunkirk and Oppenheimer were still amazing movies, in my opinion.",
            "Which ones? Person of Interest was fantastic, and Fallout has been considered a huge success.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, I'm not saying that Jonathan was the ONLY reason that those movies were masterpieces. Just that the two brothers together make masterpieces and Jonathan's noticably missing from Christopher's last three movies. Also, Jonathan Nolan hasn't made any movies on his own, only TV series.",
            "I have to agree. I love Nolan but I'm always surprised by the praise Dunkirk gets. I just found the whole thing pretty uninteresting and like we'd seen it all before.",
            "Absolutely. It couldn't be a charismatic movie by nature. It would've been disrespectful to have pizaz. But it was missing a little bit of feeling to me personally, for the subject matter. But I will say, the last line of the film has stuck with me for the last year and it really made the whole movie for me. It was almost like the whole movie was to build up that final line and it really made an impact on me.",
            "Westworld had one good season.",
            "Lol, honestly!",
            "Lol! Hey, the same people are seeing it within an hour of me posting it! That's super cool!",
            "Yep, it most likely was you lol. Bit crap that it was deleted without explanation.",
            "Meanwhile, the sound design will emphasise explosions over coherent dialogue.",
            "I love how articulated your comment is. I completely agree with you. I do hope they do some projects together again while they're doing their own.",
            "Your last paragraph indicates that they split on good terms then! I do hope they make more projects together. I like Lisa Joy but she's no Chris Nolan or Jonathan Nolan. Not yet, at least. Once she kind of took the front seat in Westworld, it went down hill (although, I don't know for certain if it was mostly because of\u00a0her, I'm just speculating) Plus, she wrote/directed Reminiscence, and while it was beautifully shot, the story wasn't good.",
            "Collaboration is easy to talk about but can be hard to do, everyone\u2019s egos can get in the way.  And I do think Christopher has blind spots/weak points, that can be hard to point out to someone who is running the project without it feeling like criticism and Christopher has a tight circle of people he works with, also he comes across as very driven and he is successful.  That makes it hard for anyone new to point out small problems in a constructive manner.   But all of this is speculation, we will know if this is case.  But I do Christopher more recent films are just some sort of interplay between the characters and in Fallout and Westworld that element is there.",
            "None of them was, except phps Neil, which was surprising at that time (yeah, i know, he is a good actor, forgetting Twilight, forgetting Twilight). It looked like if he was the only actor, who barely understood the script, with all it's impacts to the persons. Or in other words, his role was \"a little bit dramatic\".",
            "I watched that in a drive-in during the pandemic and attributed the inaudible dialogue\u00a0largely due to the sound coming through my car radio, turns out it was inaudible for everyone and I haven\u2019t bothered to watch again to check",
            "I rewatched it with a friend and were pausing a lot to talk about what was going on. My opinion of it went way down after discussing it in detail with someone. The movie has some cool visuals but jesus christ.",
            "Yeah, I have very good hearing but I had so much trouble with that movie. It was baffling to me. His response to the mixing criticism made me lose a lot of respect for him too, honestly. Felt pompous or something, not entirely sure how to articulate it.",
            "Primer is definitely one.  I watched that when I was like 16 and sick with the flu. That was an experience.",
            "Dude I sooo agree. There is something missing as far as a \"strong\" female character in his movies, but Selina Kyle was so different. Although I gotta give props to Elliott Page's character.\u00a0",
            "Yeah, I love movies - I watch probably 5-7 of them every week.  I find Oppenheimer weird as well, as the soundtrack while people are talking sounds like something out of an action movie.  It just feels weird.",

            "\u201c I believe we did.\u201d",
            "I'm speaking of the emotion in those shows. It's what's desperately missing from Christopher's movies. \n\nOverall, Westworld only works for a season. Probably the same for Fallout. But they play emotion and humanity very very well in those seasons.",
            "I'd argue Season 2 was good. If anything, the Akacheta episode alone makes up for the rest of it being such a mess.",
            "While the second wasn't a masterpiece like the first, it was entertaining and I think fair to say reached the level of \"good.\"",

            "WHAT? CAN'T HEAR YOU. I'll just put subtitles on",
            "I mean, they didn't actually ever \"split\" seeing as they were never actually \"together\". Sure, they worked together most of the time but they were never like the Coen Brothers or something. Jonathan's been doing his own thing for a while now, he originally wrote Interstellar by himself and he did Person of Interest for 5 seasons before Westworld came to fruition. Even Chris did Inception without Jonathan.",
            "Also, I think Robert Pattinson just brought the magic that I'm talking about to that role. I also give credit to the little bit that Aaron Taylor Johnson was in the movie.\u00a0\n\n\nJohn David Washington dissapointed me in Tenet. I don't think he was ready for that type of movie/role. He was amazing in BlacKkKlansman and I think he really found his footing in The Creater, too. Albeit, more as the film went on.\u00a0",
            "Mixing is actually one of the reasons I do not see his movies in theaters most of the time. It was really bad in Tenet, but basically all of his movies that I can remember have terrible mixing. The movies are so loud that I want to wear earplugs, but if I do that I can't hear the dialogue. So I usually end up waiting any watching them when I can control the volume and put subtitles on.\n\nIt is not just limited to him, though he is one of the worst offenders. So many big budget movies do exactly the same thing and I legitimately cannot understand why. My theory, based on nothing, is that because the people working on it already know the dialogue they do not recognize how difficult it can be to understand when every other sound in the movie is blaring. And I think they make the sound so loud to try and bring you into the world of the movie more.\n\nRegardless of why though, I hate it. Ruins movies for me.",
            "I'm glad we have the same view! Yeah! I don't know... personally I find his female characters to be kind of too mean and cold. Women can be strong without being ice. Elliot Page's character was great, too. But again, Jonathan wrote those movies too.",
            "I\u2019ve thought a lot about Oppenheimer and how much i do not understand the praise it\u2019s getting. Oppenhiemer being a shit movie is one of my hottest takes apparently lol. Glad to meet somebody who agrees it\u2019s not the best movie ever made haha. What movies have you watched this week btw?",
            "Honestly brings tears to my eyes.",
            "Can\u2019t say I agree with you. Oppenheimer and Dunkirk had plenty of emotion. I think what you\u2019re looking for is a soap opera.",
            "I adore that episode!",
            "The seasons after 1 tend to work well emotionally but not logically. Which supports the argument that the brothers work best supporting each other and shoring up the other\u2019s weak points.",
            "I, too, want to know what movies you guys have been seeing this week.\u00a0",

His rage was partly fueled by white privilege, but partly because the system he thought would reciprocate, didn\u2019t. \n\nThis was the era where corporate pensions were disappearing and running out of money. People were starting to see through the Regan era hypocrisy. You know the boomers \u201cwork hard for a company and they\u2019ll take care of you\u201d line? This period is where it started becoming clear it was all bullshit.\n\nHe was a bad person and his reactions were wrong, but many of his criticisms of the system weren\u2019t wrong. Look at his conversation with the rich guys on the golf course through the lens of today\u2019s housing crisis. Or the black guy outside the bank who couldn\u2019t get a loan.

So let's just say it out loud:\n\nHe likely did not wake up that morning with the idea fully formed in his head that he would abandon his car in traffic and walk across LA to his wife's house to murder her and his daughter and then kill himself.\n\nFine.\n\nBut, absolutely and unquestionably, by the time he got there that was going to be the outcome.\n\nFirst let's look at the fact that at least one of the reasons for his divorce was his anger and control issues which led to a restraining order on him from his ex-wife.\n\nSecond, his own mother whom he lived with literally says in the movie that at times he looks at her \"like he wants to kill\" her. She is terrified of her own adult son.\n\nThese two plot points alone are clear indicators that he is a dangerous and menacing individual with an evil intent. You've heard of Chekov's gun? This is an example of Chekov's gun.\n\nThird, he becomes violent over and over throughout the film. He smashes up the Korean grocery store because of an argument, he violently clashes with the gang-members (to be fair because they threatened him, but violent activity nonetheless), he shoots a gang member in the leg after they tried to kill him, he shoots up a telephone booth because someone is rude to him, he pulls out a gun in the Whammy Burger over poor customer service, he gets into an altercation and subsequently kills a neo-nazi (who notably sympathized with him), he sucker-punches a driver in the face for berating an old woman, he fires a rocket launcher at a road-crew for closing a road, fires a shotgun into the air above two elderly golfers because they were rude to him, and shoots a cop (Predergast's partner) who was trying to detain him. All before bringing a gun to violate the restraining order his ex-wife had placed on him. By the end of this day, there was no way he wasn't going to annihilate his family and then kill himself. That was 100% the point of his character arc.\n\nLook, I get it: Schumacher deliberately chose Douglas because he is a sympathetic actor who normally plays good (if flawed) guys. And he placed this character in situations where the audience is absolutely supposed to take at least a somewhat sympathetic pleasure in unleashing anger at the shitty people he encounters. But all of that is deliberate. We're supposed to enjoy what he does because we are meant to think that Douglas is playing the good guy after all. It's only at the end when he's so far past the point of no return (a phrase that was deliberately used in the script) that we are meant to realize that he really was the (main) bad guy all along.",

If you realize that at times Michael Douglas is taking out his frustration on the little guy who's also a victim of the system that he's got legit grievances about, that's part of your job as a viewer.  Surely, the directors/writers meant this.  The neo-Nazi pawn shop guy and gang bangers deserved some comeuppance; the happy burger clerk and customers - not so much.  The difference in experience with Michael Douglas and the Black guy dressed identically and having a similar bad day - all these things are part of what you need to digest and improve the movie...even while it makes our Michael Douglas less of an unambiguous good guy.\n\nI like my current work, but in ages past, I'd line up Office Space, Falling Down, (proper 1971) Vanishing Point, and Bridge on The River Kwai.

The depression and confusion caused by recession, unemployement, etc. \nIt is about the rage many felt and just wanted to scream it out.\n\nIt.s not a movie about Heat. But the Heat is almost a character (so impressively well done that you almost sweat and get nervous watching the movie). Is like an evil presence amplifing the main character feelings, state of mind.\n\nThe guy is not angry at the asian guy because the soda is more expensive. He is pissed off about everything that happens to him. He is confused and has no fucking clue why. So, the asian business man suffers the effects of his frustrations pilling up.\n\nThe name of the movie, \"Falling Down\" is an amazing choice. The movie starts some where up and ends down  (on the beach), a metaphor if his mental state. Same time, the rest of the world is going up (the contrast between people in the traffic jam and the ones on the peer).\n\nDuring the movie we see him facing some of the issues of the society during those times.\n\nThere are so many things to say about this movie. Oh man, the image, the writting... the actors!!!\n\nThe movie is definitely a classic and one of the best movies of Joel Schumacher and Michael Douglas and influenced many movies (even nowadays).\n\nPS: if you wish to make a parallel, Fight Club is for end of 90s what Falling Down was for beginning of 90s (and don.t get me started about Fight Club being a movie about... illegal fights).",

You don\u2019t see freakouts in gun stores or boxing gyms. \n\nAnd while any criminal may be able to assault others, the police will be summoned and send out alerts.

Literally, all D-Fens had to do was just... leave and find another store. But he insists on having his way, and that pattern is established throughout the rest of the movie, culminating in the reveal of him losing his temper at a *baby*, his own daughter.\n\nIt feels like a deconstruction of the revenge fantasies of the '70s and '80s... but I wonder if that was the movie's intent. I tried a cursory look-up of the intent of the movie, and couldn't find much. Sometimes, filmmakers inadvertently make a film telling a much different story.",

If he\u2019s so critical of the system, why does he hold up a bunch of innocent people at the McDonalds knockoff but doesn\u2019t raise a finger to help the guy outside the bank? This is why the literal Nazi strikes a chord with him, at least until D-Fens is threatened again and responds the same way he does to everything else. He\u2019s an empty reactionary who is raging at the inconsistencies in a system he would otherwise be happy to benefit from.

He's a racist who threatens a shop owner because the guy is not white, then he goes off to pick a fight with gang members and causes multiple innocents to get shot in the process (in the funniest scene of the movie). Then he shoots up a McDonald's because he's too late for breakfast, teams up with a literal neo-nazi and shoots him when he realizes the neo-nazi hates all people, not just Asian shop owners (in a scene that is intended to make you realize this guy is more dangerous than an actual nazi).

He\u2019s a spoiled buffoon. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some people say this movie is more relevant than ever but I think the opposite has happened. It\u2019s along the lines of Fight Club and American Beauty where our protagonists are \u201ctrapped\u201d by their own comfort.

All humans face injustices, both minor and major. Frustrations, failures, and flat out bad treatment from others. The key is it's generally looked down upon to explode with rage and violence. I'm agreeing with your point and doubling down on the idea that it's nonsense to read it as ambiguous.

            "I mostly agree, but with some key differences. \n\nYes his anger is obviously relatable and also misdirected. But we aren\u2019t meant to fully relate with him. \n\nThe guy is a complicated character\u2026 he\u2019s clearly been a hard worker, but also he\u2019s clearly got some mental health problems. \n\nHis family is there to show us that the mental health issues aren\u2019t new - they\u2019ve been there, but under the radar, for years. \n\nThe police interactions with his ex wife show that nobody is taking him seriously - in part because they don\u2019t believe the ex wife (which is another society problem), but in part because if we jailed everyone who was a bit off, it would be a huge population.\n\nWhat we are meant to gather from the film is that there are many people out there who are barely hanging on. And as society continues to decay, at some point, people do snap. \n\nAs you say, most people today would look at the problems he had, and wish that our lives were so simple, and this is why it\u2019s more relevant today than when it came out. All of the problems that existed then exist now, and are bigger/more complicated\u2026 and there are many new problems, too. \n\nAlso, part of the genius of the movie is that even characters who are clearly an unlikable stereotype (eg: the Nazi), somehow have some charisma to them. I still get a laugh every time I see the scene where he asks the female officer how come they don\u2019t get called \u201cofficer-esses, kuz, you know\u201d (hand waves from top to bottom highlighting her body).

The protestor is supposed to be another DFens, he's even dressed the same as Michael Douglas. His legal protest is completely impotent, and he ends up crushed by the state anyways. \n\nTo use a historical analogy, the protestor is like Frederick Douglass, and Dfens is more like John Brown. Both had the same cause of abolition, one tried to achieve it within the system through non-violent means, and one tried to achieve it outside the system through very violent means. \n\nNeither of them were very successful, the change occurred because of another reason (secession & war).

Your point about everyone facing adversity and failures but it's no excuse to shoot up a McDonald's is the entire thesis of the Robert Duvall half of the movie, which D-Fens fans seem to ignore even exists. D-Fens complains the whole movie that he \"lost\" his family, that it was \"taken\" from him, but Duvall's detective *actually* lost his daughter to SIDS, and his wife's mental stability died with their child. But he keeps a relatively cheery outlook, is kind to his wife (to a point) and a mentor to his colleagues (even when they're mean to him).

The only way out is through. **That** is what the movie's saying. \n\nD-Fens' rants about the price of Coke or what time McD's stops serving breakfast were all just common cultural complaint points around the water cooler, to lure the audience into identifying with him (which is also why Schumacher cast Douglas, an inherently sympathetic leading man), before interrogating whether indulging in these machismo fantasies are worth the road it leads down.",

            "To expand on what you\u2019re saying, he doesn\u2019t just stand up to his wife either.\n\nI know there was that one asshole detective razzing him through the movie, and towards the end when the detective mentions Duvall\u2019s wife he finally gives the guy the knuckle sandwich he deserved.\n\nThen at the end when the Captain that was also an asshole to him tries to play up Duvall\u2019s work to the media and act chummy, Duvall says something to him like \u201cFuck you very much Captain Yardley\u201d, again standing up for himself after being treated like shit.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t cross a line and start shooting places up, I would say Duvall\u2019s reactions were much more proportional to the situation, whereas D-FENS busted up the guys store because he couldn\u2019t get change for a phone call (to presumably stalk/harass his wife).",
            ">There's no evidence he was ever abusive. The ex-wife even says the judge went too far by denying him visitation\n\n???    \nShe has a restraining order against him. Courts dont give those out unless there's a reason.    \nIt's also aluded to many many times. He repeatedly calls his wife through the film with veiled threats & their conversations implicate past incidents. His mother is deathly afraid of him to the point that she doesn't touch anything of his at all.   \n>Did you not watch the movie?\n\nI'm wondering if you watched a single clip on YouTube and decided to jump into conversations about something you never actually watched. Literally just before getting on the pier he shoots Duvall's partner. Then he takes his wife & daughter down the pier at gun point. Duvall shows up, distracts his attention, & then the wife snatches the gun and runs off with their daughter to safety."

The parts that talk about Mr Miyagi\u2019s war experience, death of his son, etc\u2026are perhaps even more emotional than the end kick.  Just a great all around movie that is more than just tournaments.  Cobra Kai was smart to pick up on and continue that.",

            "The big major reason I think it continues to endure:  It's kind of not about karate. Yeah obviously it is a coming of age story about a kid in a new town vs. bullies that you've seen a million times before. But more than that, it's about Daniel and Mr. Miyagi's father-son like bond that forms. How Daniel not only needed Mr. Miyagi to teach him how to be a responsible young man but how Miyagi needed a son to pass down what he learned over his life. He doesn't just teach him how to fight but teaches him how to paint a fence, how to be responsible with chores, gives him a nice car so he can treat a girl on a nice date. It's about found family.\n\nThe movie grows on you with time. As a kid its initially just the fun fantasy of a kid gaining martial arts skills, beating up the bullies, and getting the girl. You're relating more to Daniel and seeing yourself in his story. But the older you get, the more you find yourself in Miyagi's story. Moreso I think if you're a parent at all. You realize that the Karate Kid is as much Miyagi's movie and his story.",

            "Cobra Kai balances the sincerity and cheese of the original films. It can be a bit more knowing than the movies, and winks at the audience now and again, but it never goes overboard. It still allows us to get involved in this story of warring dojos for kids.",

But like I said, I do think it\u2019s entertaining. The adults stories are better. Some of the banter is great. Johnnys growth is fun to watch",
            "I'd have to disagree. It dips the moment they pulled that garbage where they redeemed the bullies without any justification for it. So like after Season 2. I'd only say the better parts of Season 3 and 4 are the fanservice to the two sequels, but even then? It's just not worth dealing with the show drastically losing the grounded approach of the original movies for cheap 90's Power Rangers-like drama and fight sequences. These people really should've just partnered with Hasbro for a Power Rangers reboot instead of doing the Karate Kid.\n\n\n Actually? I wouldn't want them to do that either because they'd try to redeem Zedd or some crap because modern writers can't comprehend that some characters are just bad. Which creates hilarious narratives like in Steven Universe where in a Thanksgiving episode, the human character Andy DeMayo is rightfully angry for having his barn stolen by literal aliens who in the story collectively genocided billions of worlds of life, but he's racist because they're used as some messed up metaphor for refugees and immigrants when the pair of characters either nearly killed all life on Earth or informed under the space Nazis. That episode undermined its own point and by the point? I was checked out.\n\n\nThe children's storylines in Cobra Kai are just awful and have the writing quality of a bad soap opera after the first two seasons. If they actually had realistic consequences instead of basically ripping off Yu-Gi-Oh! and having grown adults making children fight for them in a children's karate tournament, it would've been far better. In the original movie? The students were the focus and it felt realistically portrayed.",
            "I stayed with the show for a while, but there's a scene where Daniel is profusing the importance of soft rock, and that's where I jumped off.\n\nIt was a fun ride, but I couldn't take it seriously enough after that.",
            "It's too unrealistic.  They're fighting with witnesses outside of a sanctioned sport in every episode.  You'll go to juvie / jail / prison for that in real life.",
            "I watched the first season and really liked it but didn't continue (mostly because I live with a wife and two daughters who had no interest.)  I think I'll wait now until the final season but definitely love hearing that it didn't taper off.",

Noticed a whole slew of movies from the last 5 years in the animated section of Netflix that I had never heard of.\n\nThrew on Leo not expecting much, and walked away loving the film. It was wholesome and funny, landing its jokes more than it flopped. It was paced well and most importantly: engaging.\n\nSince Leo was excellent we ended up watching another one tonight: The Sea Beast. This movie had gorgeous animation. I was enthralled for the first 30 minutes. It drug on for a bit too long and basically ended up being \"How To Train Your Sea Beast\", but it was good enough that I don't regret watching or feel like I wasted my time. It got a bit muddled in its messaging in the second half and resolved the whole corrupt kingdom thing far too easily, but overall was fun.\n\nI'm probably going to check out more of the recent Netflix Animated Films. Have I just been living under a rock? I've never heard of these and they seem solid. Maybe not Pixar and Dreamworks quality, but better than anything Illumination puts out at the very least.",

            "While not a movie, I think it is a mini series, Pluto deserves some high praise. I don\u2019t want to give anything away but it is more like an origin story for a well known character most know about. The animation is jaw dropping, dialog and script done really well, and overall the best I\u2019ve seen so far for anime off Netflix.",

It was pretty funny to me seeing how he tried to stop himself from going to far on the typical Adam Sandler jokes. It's like, the same favour of humour as in Grown Ups or Hotel Transylvania was still there, but just the beginning of the jokes, and then it felt like he went \"Oh wait, this is a kids movie', lmao.

            "Transformers: War for Cybertron is fantastic.\u00a0It\u2019s a 3 season mini series, not a movie, and It\u2019s nothing like the Micheal Bay movies. It uses the original character models and there are no humans. It\u2019s very dark and gritty and touches on profound concepts of life and purpose, it is NOT a kids show and has a very serious tone. \u00a0Well written and voice acted, and has great animation. Even if you are not familiar with the Transformers franchise it takes its time to set up a whole world of characters, history, and climax. It\u2019s by far the best adaptation of the Transformers franchise, even beating the amazing 80s movie.\u00a0",

Final Space though unceremoniously cancelled, was also a good watch. Inside Job was also quite hilarious. The first few seasons of Brickleberry were also good. Bo Jack Horseman though not my brand of comedy, was well loved by many. Same with Arcane and Blue Eyed Samurai. And I also really enjoyed The Mitchells versus the Machines which is a movie.",

They have a ton of great animated movies and shows, with a wide variety of styles and genres, and they\u2019re pretty actively releasing more.

            "Not a movie but a fantastic animated series, Blue Eyed Samurai.\n\nIt's a thrill ride from start to finish with a classic for the genre revenge plot that deepens with each episode. Every scene is shot with a hyper-competency for staging and symbolism that puts some live action films to shame; and the fight choreography is some of the most satisfying I've seen in years without causing adrenaline fatigue during a binge watch.",

            "Hey, just want to point out that Netflix isn't really doing the animation.  I've worked on Seabeast, Mitchells vs The Machines, and a few other films that went to Netflix.  Netflix is the client for other Animation and VFX studios who produce all of the visuals on screen.  In cases like Seabeast, the producers, writers, and directors were employee'd by Netflix while all of the visual artists were Sony Animation and Sony Imageworks.  Mitchells was a full Sony project until covid hit and theaters closed.  They kept holding the finished film waiting for the pandemic to end and when it didn't, they sold it to Netflix, which had nothing to do with it up until that point.\nI think Netflix producing all of this animation is fantastic and pushing for a lot of new ideas and animation styles.  Just wanted to point out that they aren't actually animating that content. That credit still belongs to the studios like Imageworks, DNEG, Disney, ILM, etc.",

I just kinda hope he gets therapy for this so he can move on from it.",
            "I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  I thought it was going to be a fun reminiscence of 80s classics, instead it was just him whining and making phone calls.\n\nDude starred as the lead in several iconic 80s films.  Pretty in Pink, Mannequin, Weekend at Bernies, St. Elmo's Fire, and seemingly had plenty of work in Hollywood after that.\n\nMost actors would kill for that kind of resume.",
            "I tend to agree. There were a lot of ways to approach this and McCarthy's was ultimately unsatisfying. The \"Brat Pack\" label was expressly derivative of the \"Rat Pack\" - a group of cool actors that liked hanging out together and making movies. Moreover, I'm not sure how \"Brat\" has more negative connotations than \"Rat\". Sammy, Dean and Frank never really whined about being called 'Rats'. They just reveled in being considered the coolest guys around.\n\nSo while the \"Brat Pack\" label may not have been particularly accurate - the group certainly wasn't the ongoing friend group portrayed in the article - neither was it an actual negative for McCarthy's career. The real negative for his career is that he never really escaped playing a rather milquetoast young man in someone else's movie. Being the least interesting part of every movie in you're in is not a solid basis for the 'A list'. So while he has had a solid career, it doesn't seem to be the career he wanted.\n\nBut if he had embraced the label and stepped outside his comfort zone, it might have been.",
            "I feel like half way through he realized the resentment he felt was more on him than on the people who perpetuated it back in the day, and he just had to keep pushing forward. I have mixed feelings, but all in all I watched it from start to finish and I enjoyed my viewing. I have been him before, realizing that I\u2019m the idiot for still being pissed. Honestly, it\u2019s brilliant showing a man go through that transition. It\u2019s hard because it feels humiliating. But it\u2019s fantastic having a documentary which actually shows a man genuinely making this transition.",
            "I watched about a quarter of it. I don't think I made it passed Ally. Yeah OP, you are right, he comes off a bit insufferable. \n\n\"How did it make you feel? Oh that's nice but, this is what it did to me and how I felt!\" \n\nMaybe he was upset because, out of all of the brat-packers, he was perhaps the least relevant?",
            "It felt like McCarthy wanted it to be a different movie than it ended up becoming. It seemed obvious to everyone besides him that, forty years later, nostalgia would cloud over any feeling of disdain or resentment that the Brat Pack name would invoke. Everyone who might still be bitter about being labeled a Brat- besides McCarthy himself- declining to be in the film probably hurt the final product as well. \n\nIt doesn't help that a couple of the interviewed Brats, Moore and Lowe, have gone on to have very successful careers in Hollywood, to where they can consider the Brat Pack era just a chapter of their wild youths, which almost goes against McCarthy's thesis (while almost confirming David Blum's take in the article that talent rises to the top). Even Estevez and Sheedy seem to have moved on further than it looked like McCarthy would have liked.\n\nIf he wanted it to be a sort of catharsis for the Brats, the film was years too late in the making. But hopefully it at least resulted in some peace for himself.",
            "I actually loved it, especially the old interview bits. Yeah McCarthy didn\u2019t come off all that well, but it was really cool seeing him get back together with the old gang and seeing them be somewhat real with each other.",
            "He really hates the word \u2018brat\u2019.",

            "I liked it. It gave me a different look at the movies of my youth and also showed me how the actors felt at the time. Several of the interviews from the 80s felt condescending towards those actors. \n\nI think it was a great way for McCarthy to change how he felt about the term and talk it over with his peers. I felt like the journalist wanted to have his cake and eat it too. \n\nI don't get the negative feelings towards this documentary.",
            "It was hard to watch only because Andrew McCarthy seemed to ask a question & then spend the entire time answering the question while the person he interviewed was just nodding & saying yeah. Seems like he just wanted to vent publicly while using his famous acquaintances to make it a marketable documentary.",
            "I couldn't agree more with your assessment, OP.\n\n* McCarthy did all this crying and moaning about being called a brat ... but he seems to be still living off residuals and doing just fine.  \n* Why didn't he bother to call Anthony Michael Hall?\n* Esteves was making these glances around the room for *someone* to save him from this conversation\n* Esteves never even offered him *a chair*.  \"I don't want a three hour conversation, so we're gonna stand, okay?\"\n* What the fuck does MALCOLM GLADWELL have to do with any of this?\n* I asked my wife, \"Did you think the term Brat Pack was derogatory?\"  She agreed with me that, no, she thought the term was like a pet name, like when I bring her a surprise and she calls me \"You stinker!\"\n* News articles are like, \"Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson Refuse to Appear!\"  ... now we know why.\n* Timothy Hutton?  Why??\n\nNot McCarthy's fault, but that journalist seemed pretty damned smug.  He sounded way too self-important.  I never even knew the term was coined by a hit-piece article, and I was a teenager in the 80s!",
            "The part that summed up this documentary for me was after interviewing David Blum for 2 hours, after shaking hands, Stay in Touch - We'll get outta your hair - goodbye's McCarthy as to still ask...\n\n\"Do you think you could have been a little nicer? Seriously.\"\n\nThis would have been better if it had just been a piece about the Brat Pack and Hollywood at the time. McCarthy's trauma was the least interesting thing in this doc. This shoulda been a feel good piece, not a personal healing journey.",

But when everyone has this sort of fondness and positive outlook except Andrew it\u2019s hard to get into it.",

Thats just what happened then (so many films touching on young issues was a new thing) but it wasn\u2019t going to continue anyway. Think he was looking for the obvious scapegoat. \n\nLiked how well adjusted to the past EE, DM, and RL were. No mention of Anthony Michael Hall or Molly/Judd involvement made we wonder why even pursue this.",
            "It should have been a documentary that looked in depth into the careers of the Brat pack members. Instead it was McCarthy just kind of whining about how it affected his career. Everyone seemed chill about it except for him and Emilio. The segment with Emilio just seemed uncomfortable",
            "I wish it was more of a reflection on the actual lives of the Brat Pack \u201cmembers\u201d themselves - the stories, their career arcs, etc. like I liked the one story about the Liza Minelli party that McCarthy/Rob Lowe talked about\n\nI thought the perspective of the influence of the term Brat Pack was interesting, but I thought the more established actors - Demi Moore and Rob Lowe- seemed more mature about taking value from it even though it may have been a negative portrayal of those actors at that time.\n\nFWIW I went and read the article, and it was pretty scathing, but was surprised that McCarthy was only mentioned once near the end of the article (and a \u201ccoworker\u201d commenting that his career wasn\u2019t going anywhere).",

            "I watched and felt McCarthy came off that way, but thought Demi and Rob came off well but they also didn't hate the term and allowed their careers to take off. But McCarthy seemed like he was soul searching and blamed the article for his career not taking off. The comment he made to Emilio  blaming the article saying Spielberg or Scorsese would would never cast a Brat Pack actor was super cringe especially when a bunch of them were cast by grewar directors, like Demi was in GI Jane which was a Ridley Scott film and A Few Good Men which was Rob Reiner. Some of the other actors who were considered part of that crew were also in movies with great directors",

Some people seem to think that he's just coasting on brat pack money.  Weird.",

            "I was excited for it to come out and it was different than what I thought it was going to be. I knew they were going to focus on the label of being called the Brat Pack but I didn\u2019t know McCarthy felt so wronged by it and hadn\u2019t really dealt with it nor had primed anyone to have those conversations. It was cringe to see him kind of realize it in some of the moments of the conversations and try to get some to immediately side with him all these years later.\n\nI thought they were all great together in their heyday and shouldn\u2019t have let one jealous critic break them up like that but for the most part they all did fine and seem to be living ok. I didn\u2019t know Ally Sheedy taught acting at NYC Community College. Always liked her, those kids are stoked to have her I\u2019m sure.\n\nI agree with Demi it would have been better to get them all in one place together and discussing the good that came from that time vs focusing on the \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nEdit: it was disappointing. I was ready to bask in nostalgia and spectator jealousy hearing from the group what I thought had to be a fun, exciting time and experience in their lives making some of the most cherished movies of my lifetime and it turned out to be a therapy session for Andrew McCarthy as others have noted who for whatever reason blames this article for his career even though he had Pretty in Pink, Less Than Zero, and Weekend at Bernie\u2019s (huge comedy) all come out after that piece in the New Yorker.\n\nHopefully an actual documentarian makes a more joyful film about the Brat Pack.",
            "I thought it was going to be like a lighter retrospective on the group, like where they all came from and all the movies they did that counted as Brat Pack movies.

I didn't know if this was going to be a reunion of sorts, or getting some more insight as to why they didn't continue making movies as a group, or hearing what the actors dealt with post hey-day.

            "Couldn\u2019t finish it. Only watched about 15 minutes. His feelings are his feelings, but I would think by now he could laugh about it and make it more about nostalgia than throwing a temper tantrum at his age. Therapy could probably help with all that.",

My VHS player ate Mannequin half way through and I think it was a mercy killing.\n\nDemi went on to do some decent things (GI Jane), but it seemed her real talent was being married  to Willis and Kutcher. I thought she had more potential, but then just kinda vanished.\n\nEstevez,,,,kind of, but he never got out from his Dad's shadow. I don't think he's any less talented than his brother, but he sure doesn't have his agent. Never understood why he wasn't written in on 2.5 men as an annoying enabling neighbor or something.

But even then, I\u2019d argue that was the case with the Brat Pack and Brat Pack-adjacent- the most talented (and I count stage presence/charisma as a talent) succeeded, while the less talented faded away.\n\nSure, Cruise and Moore and Lowe and Penn are all obnoxiously good looking, but I can also point to multiple roles for each of them that demonstrate their worth as actors."

So if he only has ten days to film something like Longlegs, they\u2019re going to shoot all his material in one block and plan everything else around it. This means he can book a bunch of these small films back-to-back since he\u2019s only working on them for a few weeks at most. Another thing is that Cage hasn\u2019t started doing TV in the last decade and a half like so many big name actors have - he\u2019s stuck solely with movies.

Very different from what I have seen in with teenagers today. \n\nMy second choice would be Ferris Bueller or Say Anything, both so good and quotable.",

The film is entirely about Cameron\u2019s story arc. \n\nHeather\u2019s was ahead of its time and feels like a movie you couldn\u2019t make today. \n\nSay Anything has lasting value for a variety of themes. Early designated driver reference (key master), early ADHD reference (I told him not to speak), interesting dynamic where the woman has the bright future in the relationship , and the guy is a supportive, lovable loser.  Lloyd and his sister, while Army brats, seemingly leave away from their parents in a non-traditional household. Diane Court lives in a single parent household.

Where the audience basically gets to choose which song/group will be a hit worldwide, and pushed as the only thing to really care about, or listen to, so much so, that at certain points through the day, or once everyday, if the song comes on, you have to stop doing whatever you are doing, (firefighters trying to put out a fire have to stop doing that) to dance to the song that's been picked.  \nIt shows this relatively young, early twenties late teens, couple, who go on the show and start singing a love song basically, and the crowd hates it at first, but they continue and push through the booing, and \"thumbs down\" voting system, eventually they win over the crowd, and the \"devil\" sees the power they have then turns the crowd against them.

Its bold exploration of taboo subjects like teen suicide, combined with its iconic dialogue and memorable performances, helped it achieve cult status.

            "He was so determined to play President Snow in the 'Hunger Games' movie that he wrote a very long letter to the film's director detailing what he thoufht of the character's personality and role.\n\nIt truly is he seems to really understand the series. \nThis is his incredible letter.\n\nDear Gary Ross:\n\nPower. That\u2019s what this is about? Yes? Power and the forces that are manipulated by the powerful men and bureaucracies trying to maintain control and possession of that power?\n\nPower perpetrates war and oppression to maintain itself until it finally topples over with the bureaucratic weight of itself and sinks into the pages of history (except in Texas), leaving lessons that need to be learned unlearned.\n\nPower corrupts, and, in many cases, absolute power makes you really horny. Clinton, Chirac, Mao, Mitterrand.\n\nNot so, I think, with Coriolanus Snow. His obsession, his passion, is his rose garden. There\u2019s a rose named Sterling Silver that\u2019s lilac in colour with the most extraordinarily powerful fragrance \u2013 incredibly beautiful \u2013 I loved it in the seventies when it first appeared. They\u2019ve made a lot of off shoots of it since then.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to write to you until I\u2019d read the trilogy and now I have so: roses are of great importance. And Coriolanus\u2019s [sic] eyes. And his smile. Those three elements are vibrant and vital in Snow. Everything else is, by and large, perfectly still and ruthlessly contained. What delight she [Katniss] gives him. He knows her so perfectly. Nothing, absolutely nothing, surprises him. He sees and understands everything. he was, quite probably, a brilliant man who\u2019s succumbed to the siren song of power.\n\nHow will you dramatize the interior narrative running in Katniss\u2019s head that describes and consistently updates her relationship with the President who is ubiquitous in her mind? With omniscient calm he knows her perfectly. She knows he does and she knows that he will go to any necessary end to maintain his power because she knows that he believes that she\u2019s a real threat to his fragile hold on his control of that power. She\u2019s more dangerous than Joan of Arc.\n\nHer interior dialogue/monologue defines Snow. It\u2019s that old theatrical turnip: you can\u2019t \u2018play\u2019 a king, you need everybody else on stage saying to each other, and therefore to the audience, stuff like \u201cThere goes the King, isn\u2019t he a piece of work, how evil, how lovely, how benevolent, how cruel, how brilliant he is!\u201d The idea of him, the definition of him, the audience\u2019s perception of him, is primarily instilled by the observations of others and once that idea is set, the audience\u2019s view of the character is pretty much unyielding. And in Snow\u2019s case, that definition, of course, comes from Katniss.\n\nEvil looks like our understanding of the history of the men we\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s not what we see: it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been led to believe. Simple as that. Look at the face of Ted Bundy before you knew what he did and after you knew.\n\nSnow doesn\u2019t look evil to the people in Panem\u2019s Capitol. Bundy didn\u2019t look evil to those girls. My wife and I were driving through Colorado when he escaped from jail there. The car radio\u2019s warning was constant. \u2018Don\u2019t pick up any young men. The escapee looks like the nicest young man imaginable\u2019. Snow\u2019s evil shows up in the form of the complacently confident threat that\u2019s ever present in his eyes. His resolute stillness. Have you seen a film I did years ago? \u2018The Eye of the Needle\u2019. That fellow had some of what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nThe woman who lived up the street from us in Brentwood came over to ask my wife a question when my wife was dropping the kids off at school. This woman and her husband had seen that movie the night before and what she wanted to know was how my wife could live with anyone who could play such an evil man. It made for an amusing dinner or two but part of my wife\u2019s still wondering.\n\nI\u2019d love to speak with you whenever you have a chance so I can be on the same page with you.\n\nThey all end up the same way. Welcome to Florida, have a nice day!",

            "I liked the story Karen Allen told years later too, about John Landis (shockingly) being an ass and demanding she do a shot of her bare butt for the one scene in the movie. Sutherland overheard this conversation and showed solidarity with her, saying he'd show his too if she had to show hers, \n\n[https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/karenallen](https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/karenallen)\n\n*At the Q&As we did in Chicago, she told a wonderful story about how John Landis, the director, came to her on the day they were shooting the scene with Donald Sutherland and told her he wanted to open on a shot of her bare behind, the \"ass shot.\" She said absolutely not. It wasn't in the script and there was no call for it and she would not do it.*\n\n*Landis was insistent, as he can be, persuasive and cajoling, demanding in a fun way. Karen became even more certain that she would not do it. She \"Dug her heels in,\" are the words she used. At some point, Sutherland, who had been watching this whole discussion / argument from the corner of the set, came up to them and said to Landis that he, Sutherland, thought that if Karen was going to have to bare her butt then he should bare his, too.*\n\n*When Landis got his jaw up off the floor he asked him how he thought he would do this very surprising thing. Sutherland said, \"Watch.\" He then left the set, whereupon he removed his pants and his boxers or whatever. He was wearing the sweater that you see in the movie, so he put his hands in the pockets and pushed it down so that it covered his \"unmentionables,\" in Karen's words. He then entered the scene, said a line to Karen, turned and reached up into the kitchen cabinet, revealing his bare bottom as casually and elegantly as only Donald Sutherland could. Karen thought at that moment that if a true movie star could do it then she certainly could and she trusted Landis enough to believe that he would use both shots. And he did.*",

And for me, it changes so much about Snow in the original trilogy:\nI don't think Snow ever truly got over Lucy Gray Baird. No one ever forgets their first love, and he was never able to resolve his feelings towards her since their relationship ended so... violently. He just pushed those feelings deep down.  And then, 64 years later, came the 74th Hunger Games. And Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12.\n\nIt probably started off small, noticing her during the Reaping. The way she made a loud first impression at the Reaping, just like Lucy had done so long ago. And Snow continued to see more and more of Lucy Gray in Katniss as that Hunger Games proceeded:  Her unique clothing choices, becoming a darling of the Capital, Peeta\u2019s love for her and determination to keep her alive, just like Snow\u2019s own determination to save Lucy as her mentor. Snow probably saw his younger self in Peeta. \n\nBut a key moment for Snow was likely watching Katniss sing the Valley song to a dying Rue, the same song that he had heard Lucy sing in the meadow so long ago. All those dormant memories came bubbling forth, reminding him of the \u201cweak\u201d man he used to be and the girl he had loved. And then Katniss and Peeta managed to win the games, making Katniss the first female District 12 victor since Lucy Gray. And Katniss did it through stretching and breaking the rules, going to a similar extreme that he had done so long ago, dropping that handkerchief into the snake tank to save Lucy's life. And just like how cheating to save Lucy's life caused his life to take a tailspin by being thrown out of the Academy and forced to enlist in the Peacekeepers, Katniss had caused unrest and chaos to take place, putting Snow's position in jeopardy once again and threatening the very same power that he had sacrificed Lucy, Sejanus, and so many others to achieve.  \n\nI think by that point, Snow took all those feelings he had over Lucy and turned them on Katniss. In her, in Katniss, he saw the ghost of the girl he thought himself free of so long ago, and all those unresolved feelings he had for Lucy developed into an obsession with Katniss. A desire to regain control, both over Panem and her. Snow desired power and control more than anything, and Lucy defied him so long ago. To Snow, he was seeing a mirror of Lucy Gray in Katniss. A girl who Katniss was a parallel of in so many ways. A District 12 girl. A victor. A survivor.\nWhen he came to see Katniss in District 12, it was likely the very first time he had set foot in District 12 since that day in the woods by the lake, when his paranoia and self-preservation consumed him. He must have been swamped with memories. \n\n    Imagine how he must have felt when Katniss was dubbed The Mockingjay, after the birds he loathed so much, the same ones Lucy had loved and sang to. Snow was already irritated by the pin, this was just a step further. Perhaps the reason he firebombed District 12 wasn\u2019t just to punish Katniss, but to eradicate his past, another act of revenge against \"the ghost of District 12\". To do as Kylo Ren famously said \"let the past die\" and burn those memories away. \nWhen he heard Katniss sing The Hanging Tree in that propaganda piece, that song would have stung deeply for him, bringing about painful memories of love and betrayal. Memories of the tree, the man screaming for his love to run, Sejanus's screams for his mother, Lucy Gray singing it for him at the party, meeting Lucy Gray beneath the tree. The song she sang to him, the last words she ever spoke to him. It turned into a blind obsession that he wanted to kill at any cost. \n\nAnd after the smoke had settled and the war had ended, perhaps he mulled on Lucy Gray during his time imprisoned. About her, their time together. The man he used to be and the man he had become. About how he lived his life. What was the point?  About the life he could have lived. About how he chose power and control over love and true friendship. Did he regret it? Did he wish that he had stayed with Lucy Gray, confessed the truth about Sejanus to her and begged for forgiveness? Perhaps, but he would never admit it. He did what he thought was right to preserve humanity and society. But when Katniss came to see him, he remembered Lucy Gray. When he apologized to Katniss for Prim, perhaps he was also apologizing to Lucy Gray for everything he did to her. \nPerhaps it was spite, perhaps a determination about not letting Coin enjoy a victory. And perhaps it was an attempt to make things right. He remembered what she had said about freedom and happiness, about not having to take another life. Whatever it was, he turned Katniss onto the danger Coin posed. And in that moment, he let Katniss, and by extension Lucy Gray, go. \nAnd then came the execution:\nAs he stared down that bow, was his life flashing before his eyes?Perhaps he was seeing not just Katniss, but Lucy Gray as well. Remembering every moment, from watching her in the reaping to that day in the forest. And then she killed Coin. With the firing of a bow, the Hunger Games were gone once and for all. And in that moment, he watched Katniss let him go, something which he had never been able to do with Lucy. \nKnowing that his words to Katniss made a difference, he managed to honor Lucy Gray's wish. He laughed, smiled and felt genuine happiness for the first time since Lucy Gray, a final moment of euphoria before his final end. And that was how the ballad of Lucy and Snow ended.\nTruly fitting. In the end: a District 12 girl brought about Snow\u2019s rise, and a District 12 girl brought about his fall.",
