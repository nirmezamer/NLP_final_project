Don't know what type of cymbals to buy, or what heads will give you the sound you're looking for? Need help deciphering that odd sticking, or reading that tricky chart? Well here's the place to ask!\n\nBeginners and those interested in drumming are welcomed but encouraged to check the sidebar before commenting.\n\nThe thread will be refreshed weekly, for everyone's convenience.

            "How do I work on playing with others by myself? I am a self taught drummer for about 7 years but I haven\u2019t ever played with anyone because I was never confident enough. I feel like I\u2019m ready now but I don\u2019t know what to practice. I have been playing with a metronome more and trying to memorize rudiment sticking instead of just trying to listen and figure it out. For context I like to play a lot of grunge into late 2000: alternative pop, punk, and I\u2019ve been getting into slightly jazzy ballads. Mostly just Adele.\nSo finally I\u2019m asking for tips to help me play with other people",
            "it's kind of hard to simulate / practice for, there isn't really any substitute for playing with live people where you're all hearing and reacting to / playing off each other. \n\nYou could try running through some drumless tracks that you don't know super well, getting a taste of feeling kind of uncomfortable where someone throws you something you're not necessarily expecting may be good prep",
            "If you can play a song or two with the drumless track, you're ready to play with others ) Just find a band of your level and try to play. You'll get much more feedback on what you need to improve or practice. It's a unique experience that is hard to learn in other ways.",
            "Other advice here is great, I'll add that if you throw on some drumless tracks of songs you know it won't help you as much for this as throwing on stuff you don't know- find random drumless gospel tracks or whatever on youtube and let it run on shuffle. Remember you don't need to play these things perfectly the first time through and you probably never will! Just focus on keeping the beat at first and as you play through a track try to learn little bits like stops or buildups or lead-in notes and try to accentuate those. In a live situation if you're just jamming and grooving with some other cats you'll never know what might come next, you'll get the hang of it fast! Have fun!"

            "Sounds good to me dude",
            "Also, don\u2019t compare to a recorded sound.  Most recorded drums today are very processed and lots of times sampled, so it\u2019s difficult to compare a live sound to it.",
            "The first thing I always do is check the tension on the bottom head and tighten it up some. That said, this snare sounds great, I wouldn\u2019t worry about messing with it too much.",
            "sounds good, and it's more important how it sounds in the context.",
            "Play drums.  If the snare sound doesn't fit - think about why.  What do *you* want out of it.  \n\nSounds fine in isolation, to me, though.",
            "What kind of snare is it ? It sounds good but if it was mine I might tighten the reso head a bit I like a nice crack on my snare\u2019s",
            "Pretty much the exact sound I always go for so I say it's perfect lol. All that matters is whether you like it or not.",
            "Sounds good to me. If you like a tight snare sound (Chad Smith, Abe Cunningham, Carter Beaufort) vs a fat low tuning (think classic rock) then you\u2019re right on the money.",
            "Sounds alright actually. You can leave it as it is. The only thing you could change, and that of course is up to your own taste, are the heads to get a bit different sound. But the tuning on the video is pretty good.",
            "Quite nice. A bit hollow sounding for my liking but it\u2019ll work for most things."
