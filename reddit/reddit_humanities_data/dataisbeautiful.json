            "I just posted a 2-minute video of Hans Rosling explaining the data behind population growth using rolls of toiiet paper. I explained that I met him in 2013 when he came to the WHO in Geneva to deliver a talk and that he explained the data behind population growth using rolls of toilet paper. It was an excellent talk.\n\nThe moderators removed it and I am trying to understand why. As the post was taken down, I am asking my question here.\n\nFor reference, the video is at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnmDc-oR9eA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnmDc-oR9eA)",
            "I have a little data set which I would like to make beautiful, and I would appreciate tips. \n\nThe data pool is about 100 items, each one being a date and numerical value from 0 to 9--if this goes well, I may break down the 0-9 values into finer granularities--I would like to set the date as an independent variable, and look at how the 0-9 value differ from a random baseline.\n\nBecause I fear this isn't going to be clear enough of an explanation for how the 0-9 value can differ from random baseline, my point is: assuming random numbers, any of the numbers from 0 to 9 would be equally likely to come up ; I would like to visualize how much more often (or less frequently) any given number comes up.\n\nAnd the thing about using the dates as an independent variable--I would like to see if the frequency of numbers coming up more often than random evolves over time.",
            "I spent hours trying to get insights from Tableau and PowerBI. The tools were too complex and not designed for marketing needs. Then I found Whatagraph. It was a relief! Whatagraph is built specifically for marketing performance monitoring and reporting. It's easy to use and gives me the insights I need to make informed decisions. I've been using Whatagraph for a while now, and it's saved me so much time and frustration.",
            "What are better ways to display US county-level (or equivalent sub-state government level) data? State data has this problem too but the variance in size between counties is much larger.\n\nI \\*hate\\* the use of US map to depict these data. The colossal counties in the western US overwhelm the small-but-far-more-populous counties east of the Mississippi. The eye is drawn to the wrong places - big areas, not the interesting data. Examples abound here and elsewhere online.\n\nA ranked list avoids the distortion-by-area, but those have the problem that there are thousands of counties, more than one duplicated name, and most aren't recognizably named (as the states and big cities are).\n\nI'm perplexed as to how best to make county-level data beautiful. Ideas?",
            "Hi, \n\nI am looking to export usage metrics that are more granular than \"you spent 20 minutes on instagram today\". What I really want is:\n\n- You opened your phone between 09:03-09:12.\n- [Bonus] You used instagram between 09:03-09:08, and youtube between 09:08-09:12.\n\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n- *Digital wellbeing* will not export data.\n\n- *Stayfree*, *ActionDash* &  *AppUsage - Manage/Track Usage* all give me aggregate usage (33 mins on instagram in the day, but not specific times).\n\n- *YourHour* in theory should do it but the button does not work and does not export anything.\n\n\n**I know the data exists, as all the above apps can display the data in-app. How can I export it?**",

Or alternatively, what's a data-driven question you'd love to see answered? \n\n* *PokemonGO/Niantic*: Is player usage increasing or decreasing?

How can we improve on-time performance in order to increase customer satisfaction?\n* *Hospitals/Doctor Office*: Can we use patient data to detect early signs of chronic diseases?

How can we adjust prices based on this data to maximize profits?\n* *Fitness App Developer*: Why aren't users sticking with their workout plans? How can we help users stay motivated and achieve their fitness goals?\n* *Health/Fitness*: How does sleep quality impact my calorie expenditure?\n* *Local Governments*: Can we predict emerging religious movements or trends? How can we predict and prevent potential areas of conflict between different faiths?\n* *Local Governments*: How can social media alert us to potential public safety threats? Can we prevent these?\n* *Education and Employment*: What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts and data scientists? How can I best prepare myself for this career?\n* *University*: How can we predict our student's success? Can we create personalized learning strategies for the student?\n* *Music Streaming Service*: What are the emerging musical trends and artists that we should push/recommend to users?\n* *Environmental Science*: What are the safest/most dangerous days/times to be outside for individuals with asthma?",
