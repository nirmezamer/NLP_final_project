            "I spent hours trying to get insights from Tableau and PowerBI. The tools were too complex and not designed for marketing needs. Then I found Whatagraph. It was a relief! Whatagraph is built specifically for marketing performance monitoring and reporting. It's easy to use and gives me the insights I need to make informed decisions. I've been using Whatagraph for a while now, and it's saved me so much time and frustration.",

            "I have personal data on some fanfic writing I do. I'd like to organize the data into charts for hits, kudos, and chapter word length. I use Google a lot like Sheets for charts and data collecting. I was curious if anyone had any other data tools I could try, preferably for free.",

Scientists are very heavily pushed to publish first, good practice be damned. Furthermore there\u2019s a clear influence of big business within science. Plus many scientists have displayed that being very well informed in a specific area does not mean a general expertise, and if anything indicates a lack of development in other areas. So I still respect scientists and academics, but my faith in large institutions and broken systems has waned.",
