I figure I have to wait until the end of the delivery window, but then report it as missing if nothing arrives. Any suggestions on how to proceed beyond that would be appreciated. Or if there is a \u201ccommon\u201d scam that I\u2019m (clearly) unaware of that I should know about.",

            "Here is my situation, I bought a camera worth \\~$1500 off of eBay because it was a good deal on something I was planning on buying(I understand that's probably where I went wrong), the seller sent it almost a week after I bought it. It was supposed to be delivered to my house last Saturday. I do not have a fence/gate or any animals in front of my house and recorded as the delivery driver drove right by and the package was then marked as not being able to be delivered and it would be delivered the next business day. Monday comes and I have filed a claim with USPS and I get a call about there being some issue with the shipping label saying it appears to have a label on top of another one. It gets delivered that day somewhere that is not my home at 4:40. I receive a proof of delivery from USPS that has someone else's signature, name, and address on it. The address isn't the same street as mine. I contact USPS and they elevate my issues to the district level. From the proof of delivery, I'm able to figure out where it claims the package was delivered to and who it claims signed for it. I get a call from someone at the district level, tell them my situation. They say they'll call my back after contacting the post office, but I have not received another call from this person. I go to this business and get talk to the operations manager who the document says was the person signing for the package. He says that the signature isn't his and that he wasn't in the office during the time of delivery and nobody else supposedly knows anything about the package. I have filed an item not received with Ebay, but they are giving the seller 3 days to respond. Any help? Obviously I would love to have my camera, but if there isn't actually any camera, I want my money back from someone, whether that be eBay, USPS, or the business that potentially stole my package.",

If you feel inclined you can respond with something to the effect of:\n\n\"Hi, thank you for reaching out. Per the item tracking number, your purchase was marked as delivered on X date. If you fear your package has been stolen, please contact your local shipping location and/or your local police station to report a theft. Unfortunately because the package has been confirmed as delivered, I cannot offer a refund.\"\n\nBeyond that, I would not engage further.\n\nIf they open a \"item never arrived\" case, upload the tracking number in a timely fashion. eBay will do the rest.",

The next day I get a notification about my items shipping all with the same tracking number so I was like great there all together. About 15 minutes later I get this message from them saying that there will be someone else package with my package and I have to bring it to the post office and mail it for them, they said they would give me a $10.00 credit for shipping them. This just sounds weird because wouldn't it have my address on the packages if I have to bring it to the post office, unless they send me a prepaid label but how do I know there's pinbacks in there and not something else, why do I have to mail the package for you, is this what they meant by combined shipping they send someone else item with mine just seems suspicious. And this seems to be a reputable seller also over 4000 items sold with 99.8% positive feedback and been on ebay for years, nothing really looks wrong at first glance.",
