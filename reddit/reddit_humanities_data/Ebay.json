            "Got scammed trying to find the transaction on my bank app and Apple Pay (I used Apple Pay) to do a charge back but I cant find it. What is another name of an eBay transaction or Apple when purchasing items.",
            "Here is my situation, I bought a camera worth \\~$1500 off of eBay because it was a good deal on something I was planning on buying(I understand that's probably where I went wrong), the seller sent it almost a week after I bought it. It was supposed to be delivered to my house last Saturday. I do not have a fence/gate or any animals in front of my house and recorded as the delivery driver drove right by and the package was then marked as not being able to be delivered and it would be delivered the next business day. Monday comes and I have filed a claim with USPS and I get a call about there being some issue with the shipping label saying it appears to have a label on top of another one. It gets delivered that day somewhere that is not my home at 4:40. I receive a proof of delivery from USPS that has someone else's signature, name, and address on it. The address isn't the same street as mine. I contact USPS and they elevate my issues to the district level. From the proof of delivery, I'm able to figure out where it claims the package was delivered to and who it claims signed for it. I get a call from someone at the district level, tell them my situation. They say they'll call my back after contacting the post office, but I have not received another call from this person. I go to this business and get talk to the operations manager who the document says was the person signing for the package. He says that the signature isn't his and that he wasn't in the office during the time of delivery and nobody else supposedly knows anything about the package. I have filed an item not received with Ebay, but they are giving the seller 3 days to respond. Any help? Obviously I would love to have my camera, but if there isn't actually any camera, I want my money back from someone, whether that be eBay, USPS, or the business that potentially stole my package.",

            "How do I contact eBay to give proof I've been FedEx tracking scammed? \nI have all the evidence I need but it's impossible to contact anyone",
            "Just bought a brand new item for about 60% off ($350). I figure theres a chance its a scam, but worst case scenario I waste some time, because eBay often sides with buyers. Is there any other risks associated with this? Thanks",
            "Hello the Seller hasnt shipped my item out after winning a bid and has it relisted with the same photos for a buy it now option and its been 2 weeks past arrival date. What do I do about something like that? Because I feel as if this is fishy and I dont wanna go thru with this transaction anymore.",
            "Hi, i ordered something a week ago on ebay. It got shipped yesterday i think, and then today i got an email from ebay@ ebay.com that said ARRIVAL AT THE GLOBAL SHIPPING CENTRE and then the text was We are writing to inform you that your transaction through the Global Shipping Programme has been successfully received at the Global Shipping Centre. You should receive additional email updates regarding delivery status.\n\n4 hours later i got another email from the same email adress saying that the transaction was dispatched and that something will reach out to me so that i can give them my birth number/National identification number for the final customs clearance, or else it might be delayed in customs apparently, according to the email. Im from europe and dont understand such complicated english haha, so im a bit confused about if this is a scam or not? I have never bought from ebay before! I have no idea how ebay works is it safe to give said person/email my birth number thing?? And is that email adress real or scam?",
            "Unbranded S23/S24 Ultra Scam?\n\nI've come across generic unbranded versions of Samsung Galaxy S23 or S24 Ultra phones on eBay. They claim to have all of the same features, but are unbranded and are about 10% of the price of the real thing (right $150-$200). I guess it's too good to be true, but I've seen some crazy deals in the past. Anyone ever tried one of these?"

My account is about 6 years old\n\n Is the seller allowed to refuse certain buyers like that? \n\nWhat do you think? Are they lying?\n\n Have I been too harsh or should I leave the negative feedback up? I don't like to ruin someones day unless they deserve it\n\nWill it come back to bite me in some way?

            "Are they doing anything for you to fix the situation that caused you to give them negative feedback?  Are they allowing you to give them money for the item they are selling and then sending you the item?  Cause that is what would make me change my feedback.  If I leave negative feedback for a good reason and they just want me to change it for no reason, then no.  If they correct the issue, I will change it.  \n\nI bought an item, and they WOEFULLY underpaid on shipping, resulting in a postage due, so I contacted the seller and they IMMEDIATELY refunded me what I paid on postage, and then some.  I left positive feedback and never even mentioned the shipping issue.  If they had not done that, I would have left negative feedback at minimum and probably a dispute.",

            "Only way they learn is to keep it where it is. I might have been tempted to answer back saying send me my item for free and Ill change it. But that would be wrong.",
            "Nope. Do not change it. eBay will not remove the feedback and it was justified as the seller LIED. They clicked that option on purpose to protect themselves. Let them learn a lesson so they dont do that to anyone else."
