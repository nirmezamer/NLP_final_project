            "Hello, and thank you for doing this AMA.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) In the southeastern region of the US that you study, are there any estimates or predictions that have a consensus in the scientific community about how much more frequent wildfires will become in the coming decades?\n\n2) Given that you have associations with and advise graduate students at Florida-based institutions, will [the recent change in Florida state law that effectively scrubs mentions of \"climate change\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251769080/florida-desantis-climate-change-law) from the state code at all impact your or their work?",
            "Hi Dr. Robertson, thanks for doing this AMA.  I'm curious what you might suggest as long-term solutions / remediations for fire danger.  I live in the PNW and the last decade or so at the end of the summer we have \"smoke season\" from wildfires in the West and Canada.\n\nWe obviously need forests for the long term health of our planet, but is there anything we (or specifically timber companies) can do differently to manage AND protect them?",
            "As a Virginian, I was quite surprised by the outbreak of wildfires here and in eastern West Virginia back in March - especially given that it seemed like we got a decent amount of precipitation plus the ever-present humidity.\n\nWas this a sign of things to come or a fairly unique set of conditions?",
            "What is your opinion of Chad Hanson?",
            "What research or technology from the past two decades has most changed the way we manage wildfire?",
            "Is it true there is a job titled \u201cBurn Boss\u201d?",
            "Why do you think that prescribed fire has continued to be so successful in the American South? Are you optimistic about the future of prescribed fire in the US?",

Since then it\u2019s been an insane amount of interviews with french, german, south korean, south american, and international news outlets. \n\nRecently I was on NPR\u2019s The World and a bunch of other sh**. Anyway, AMA about the hack, personal stuff, whatever! Happy to answer. I have not yet been murdered or arrested, so that\u2019s pretty good.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/B2hD9OY  + https://www.wired.com/story/p4x-north-korea-internet-hacker-identity-reveal/\n\nMore proof with username: https://imgur.com/a/pih4WWG\n\n##Edit: Holy shit folks, how did this actually get popular? \n\nI expected like 5 upvotes lol. I have to do some actual work but I'll get back to absolutely everyone that asks a question who isn't a dick :). Thanks to everyone for being here, I promise I'll be back and answer everything!\n\nI don't have a PR team unfortunately. But I'll see if my cats are up for answering with mashed keyboard type shit in the meantime.\n\n##\n\nEdit 2: Shameless plug for my twitter https://x.com/_hyp3ri0n but really, I do share everything I do there.\n\nAnyway I'll STILL BE BACK. I can't believe this is at the top. I feel like president Obama. Someone just has to \"an asteroid\" me.\n\n##Edit 3: \n\nI'm intermittently back because holy fuck 6.1k?!? Shit. OK. Time to answer, I made a promise.\n\n##Edit 4: \n\nJust a word of thank you to everyone, no I am NOT leaving, I just wanted to say thanks for coming and asking shit. https://imgur.com/a/6SHKbNT\n\n##Edit 5: I see some bitching about the length of the article. First of all that's Andy Fucking Greenberg, he's a fucking boss so read his shit. Second there's ChatGPT. Third here's my short summary of how i did it: https://x.com/_hyp3ri0n/status/1803195682662051854\n\nEdit 6: i\u2019m going to sleep but keep asking and i\u2019ll get to everyone :).\n\n##\n\nEdit 7 common questions and answers:\n\n- yes i\u2019m single (ok not that many have asked but fuck you it\u2019s my AMA :P\n\n- If you\u2019re intelligence, DoD, or have interesting propositions beyond some vague \u201cyou should do x\u201d (those are welcome if they\u2019re unique) you can email me here: pax-ama@opayq.com\n\n- Here\u2019s some semi-technical details of the attack: https://x.com/_hyp3ri0n/status/1803195682662051854\n\n- No civilians were harmed in the attack. Only the elite aka regime have internet access, this was quite targeted. Civilians are unlikely to even know this happened. In fact they probably don\u2019t.\n\n##Edit 648\n\nNext person to tell me i\u2019m an amoral imperialist is going straight to DCSA (DoD investigations)\n\n##How I hack!?\n\nFirst buckle in because it\u2019s a years not weeks or months endeavor to be good. If you\u2019re willing to put in the work anybody can get good. It\u2019s like Ratatouille (or Racacoonie depending on your universe), anyone can hack!\n\nFirst read a fuckton of introductory online resources. Go to securitytube and watch anything by Vivek. Man knows his shit.\n\nFind introductory courses or buy intro books, some recommendations:\n\n- Linux Basics for Hackers\n\n- Metasploit: something somethjng (forget the full title)\n\n- This next one is challenging and dated but an absolute must read: Hacking the Art of exploitation\n\n- I hear Georgia Weismann\u2019s PenTesting book is good and she\u2019s a nice lady. So is her mom. That\u2019s not a mom joke. I actually met her and she\u2019s very sweet.\n\n- Download and learn how to use virtualbox it\u2019s probably the easiest way to start. It\u2019s a virtualization software that you run essentially an operating system within an operating system. It\u2019s open North Korea\u2019s malware on my machine and that\u2019s why it could not spread absolutely anywhere.. it\u2019s useful for learning other operating systems so install Linux on there. I generally recommend Linux mint or Ubuntu. Parallels for MacOS users. If you want to real challenge, install something like freeBSD and learn how to use that.\n\n- The web application hackers handbook is the Bible Web application hacking I always tell people if you read it from cover to cover and do all of the exercises. You\u2019ll absolutely be a really good web app hacker\n\n- Black hat python by Justin is recommended. Justin is a really good dude and does some really amazing projects. I know he knows his shit. In terms of the actual content, the goal is to learn python so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t fully understand all of the attacks going on. Although he explains them really well.\n\n- for mobile, hacking I don\u2019t know fuck all about it. So ask somebody smarter than me. Georgia I mentioned earlier I did some work in there so I don\u2019t know fucking ask her.\n\n- If you\u2019re interested in macOS hacking there\u2019s just a little bit of a dated book called the macOS hackers handbook I honestly haven\u2019t read it so I can\u2019t speak to the quality, but is the absolute Jesus of macho ass hacking.\n\n- for more macOS stuff there are some books that are called. I think exploiting the macOS Colonel or maybe it\u2019s just called the macOS Colonel highly suggest those but none of these ones are for the faint of heart.\n\n- Use a lot of resources for courses. Security tube is an amazing resource watch anything by a dude named Vivek know who I\u2019m talking about. He has a bunch of shit on there. If you\u2019re starting out, look for beginners shit, go onto Udemy.\n\n- if you want to pay out the ass, but also get a certification that people actually respect there is OSCP by offensive security, but in my opinion, the shit is a little bit overrated\n\n- For programs, you can literally just download and learn right now and nmap is one of the most important ones for beginners. I think metasploit is really important and there\u2019s a shit ton of material out there on it. Learn how passwords are stored and cracking passwords. Even just knowing what that means is important. So look up hashing and no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with smoking hash, though that is an optional step\n\nI did see interest in MacOS so here:\n\n- \n\n\nwill post more soon ",
