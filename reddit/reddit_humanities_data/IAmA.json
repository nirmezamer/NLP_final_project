            "Hello, and thank you for doing this AMA.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) In the southeastern region of the US that you study, are there any estimates or predictions that have a consensus in the scientific community about how much more frequent wildfires will become in the coming decades?\n\n2) Given that you have associations with and advise graduate students at Florida-based institutions, will [the recent change in Florida state law that effectively scrubs mentions of \"climate change\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251769080/florida-desantis-climate-change-law) from the state code at all impact your or their work?",
            "Hi Dr. Robertson, thanks for doing this AMA.  I'm curious what you might suggest as long-term solutions / remediations for fire danger.  I live in the PNW and the last decade or so at the end of the summer we have \"smoke season\" from wildfires in the West and Canada.\n\nWe obviously need forests for the long term health of our planet, but is there anything we (or specifically timber companies) can do differently to manage AND protect them?",
            "As a Virginian, I was quite surprised by the outbreak of wildfires here and in eastern West Virginia back in March - especially given that it seemed like we got a decent amount of precipitation plus the ever-present humidity.\n\nWas this a sign of things to come or a fairly unique set of conditions?",
            "What is your opinion of Chad Hanson?",
            "What research or technology from the past two decades has most changed the way we manage wildfire?",
            "Is it true there is a job titled \u201cBurn Boss\u201d?",

            "Is it windier on average this year compared to other years or decades?",
            "Oooh i might have missed this but wanted to ask if the SE USA with its remarkably different and humid climate (plus swamps) has similar mechanisms to how fire affects coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest, namely that there are certain plants that germinate DUE to having been exposed to a forest fire, meaning that fire is part of a cycle in the biome?",
            "You make an argument for promoting native biodiversity in here. I think that's a good idea so please don't take this as an attack, but in Oregon we're seeing, especially in the south of the state, that we don't have the same weather conditions that led to the growth of our forests in the first place. We're getting dryer and hotter. It doesn't seem possible to recreate that native biodiversity. Should we adopt a policy of trying to recreate central California's native biodiversity? \n\nAlso, I've been reading about the history of the state and was kind of shocked to find in the northern part of the state, the native biodiversity pre 1830s was more more hardwood forests as opposed to the kinds of forest we have now. Apparently the majority of the state's forests are secondary growth. How can we figure out what native biodiversity actually is if we're about 7 to 8ish generations into a pretty new ecology?",
            "When are we getting AI powered firefighting drone swarms?",
            "Hi Kevin,\n\nWhat's your take on the need to diversify the forestry sector in Florida from mostly commercial pine species to long-leaf pine and hardwoods? My understanding is that the pine market has softened while the hardwood market has made it more competitive, and deciduous trees tend to provide some natural resistance to burning, either in mixed forests or hardwood dominant forests.",
            "I heard recently that scientists are advocating when there is a forest fire to just\"let it burn\". Their reasoning was something around that the forest will actually become more resilient when it regrows. \n\nDo you think that's true? How do you feel about such statements?",

Thank you so much!",
            "Can't we just create artificial rain in places with rampant forest fires?",
            "A simple but serious question: why is every board and staff member of your organization, as well as all your visitors (from photos on your web site) white?  Your history says that your property was originally a slave-holding estate, but it is now 2024. The area where you are located is actually minority white. How do you account for this, and why should anyone want to work with you? How do you justify working for an apparently racist institution?",
            "1. I think there is a consensus that weather events will become more extreme, both tropical storms (which bring precipitation that fuels growth of plants and thus fuel for fire) and droughts. The frequency of wildfires, that is, how many individual fires occur, is probably not as big of a concern as how widespread and difficult to control each wildfire is. Given stronger droughts, I am afraid we will see more of what we saw in southeastern Louisiana last year, which was uncontrollable wildfires in long-fire-excluded pine plantations that in the past were not very prone to wildfires. Almost any vegetation type will burn if it is dry enough. Of course prescribed fire (controlled fires applied in careful settings)\u00a0 is a very effective way of reducing fuel loads and mitigating the effects of wildfires and making them easier to contain.\n\n2. I am not sure who exactly that law applies to, but I am assuming that it is employees of state agencies and not college professors. Assuming that is true, I do not see it directly impacting our research. I am not sure if it will influence what kinds of grants will be available or what will be considered legitimate topics in grant proposals.",
            "It is a tough problem, especially as there has been as much as a century of fuel accumulation in many of the systems. The solutions, to the degree that there are ones, depend on the forest community type. Some forest communities, like lodgepole pines, historically burned with high intensity fires that were not necessarily unnatural. Generally, industrial forestry tries to mimic such fires with clearcuts, which both produces a product and avoids catastrophic crown fires, but we obviously do not want to clearcut everything. Doing patch harvests helps break up the fuels to make the fires more manageable, so that is one approach, as well as forest thinning. It will take some time for the forest industry to figure out the best ways to make the forests more wildfire resilient.",
            "Virginia is interesting, like North Carolina, in that it has mountains, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain ecosystems. In the mountains, wildfires are often more common in the fall during dry conditions. In the Coastal Plain and Piedmont, wildfires can occur throughout the year, but tend to be more common in the spring.\u00a0 Across the region, including in Virginia, most wildfires are caused by humans - either by accident or intentionally. Climate change impacts on wildland fire in the region may lead to more flash droughts (rapidly developing droughts) and extreme temperature days, both of which may lead to more wildfires. Intense rainfall is also an expected outcome of climate change and that can reduce wildfire occurrence on one hand, while also potentially increasing vegetative fuels, which can lead to more intense fires.\u00a0 One of the biggest wildfire concerns in the South and across the country is the expansion of the wildland urban interface (WUI) as housing moves into wooded / vegetative areas. This intermix of human development and natural fuels can make for really complicated and difficult wildfire suppression. It is important for folks living in WUI areas to be ready for fire throughout the year and also to understand the importance of practices like prescribed fire for reducing hazardous fuels and wildfire risk. For more information on wildfire safety and mitigation, FireWise USA is a program designed to train homeowners how to prepare for wildfires ([NFPA - Firewise USA\u00ae](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa)), and the University of Georgia has a course on firescaping, the practice of using landscaping practices to mitigate wildfire risk, for certified master gardeners ([Ready for Advanced Training? Register for Firescaping! | Trellis Blog (uga.edu)](https://site.extension.uga.edu/mgevp/2024/05/ready-for-advanced-training-register-for-firescaping/)).",
            "I\u2019m sorry, I have not read his work. I will check into it.",
            "Drones or UAVs are some of the most impressive technology that we\u2019re seeing involved in fire management right now. They are being used to track and understand the movement of wildfires, to identify hotspots, and to rapidly create maps.\u00a0 They are also increasingly being used for prescribed fires. In addition to mapping and hotspot identification following prescribed fires, drones are being used as ignition tools. Hardware and software like the Ignis system from Drone Amplified can be programmed to precisely drop small plastic spheres that ignite shortly after hitting the ground. This drone-based system is similar to helicopter-based ignition systems that have been used for decades by agencies to conduct large prescribed fires. This 2023 webinar from the Southern Fire Exchange explores private-contractor examples of drone prescribed fire applications: [https://youtu.be/oWOLTNMi7bc?si=lDW04cYkje0aN02n](https://youtu.be/oWOLTNMi7bc?si=lDW04cYkje0aN02n). In addition, this 2024 Southern Fire Exchange webinar talks about some other technology applications related to prescribed fire in the South: [https://youtu.be/ZrxY1TxOs-E?si=ofiZXaHEWyU2-2kF](https://youtu.be/ZrxY1TxOs-E?si=ofiZXaHEWyU2-2kF).\n\nOther technological advances include near real-time detection of wildfires through satellite remote sensing, as more satellites are launched that have the capability to detect heat. New fire behavior models are in the works that will result in a big step forward in fire behavior prediction, such as FIRETEC. FIRETEC is a 3-dimensional fluid dynamics model that uses extremely detailed 3-D fuel maps, topography, and weather inputs to predict fires in a very realistic way. The 3-D models are created by terrestrial and aerial LIDAR, a laser technology for mapping 3-D objects.\u00a0 These technologies are moving fuels and fire behavior mapping forward in ways that will likely support prescribed fire and wildfire management.",
            "Yes! Burn Bosses are certified individuals who \u201ccall the shots\u201d so to speak on prescribed fires, and they are the ones who take responsibility for the outcome of the burn by signing the authorized prescription. Prescribed fires are controlled fires that we apply to the landscape for a variety of objectives: reducing fuel loads for wildfires (aka uncontrolled fires), promoting specific vegetation for wildlife, or maintaining the aesthetics of a forest. There are lots of factors that go into making sure a fire is \u201ccontrolled\u201d like humidity, wind direction, smoke, fire behavior, neighboring sensitive areas, existing fuel loads and types, tree density, and more. These factors are described by the written prescription. If the fire becomes out of prescription, then the burn must be discontinued. Burn Bosses are certified by their state agencies to make sure they have the knowledge and experience necessary to feel confident in making the call to start and complete a prescribed burn. Each state and even each agency/organization may have different qualifications for burn bosses, but the commonality is their profound knowledge and experience with applying prescribed fire. As an example, here is a link to the certified burn manager course for Florida [Certified Prescribed Fire \u2014 Acreage / Prescribed Fire / Wildland Fire / Forest & Wildfire / Home - Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (fdacs.gov)](https://www.fdacs.gov/Forest-Wildfire/Wildland-Fire/Prescribed-Fire/Certified-Prescribed-Fire-Acreage)\u00a0.",
            "There is also a title \u201cmix master\u201d for aerial prescribed fire for heli torching. Pretty good one",
            "yes. it\u2019s a requirement to have a certified burn boss design a burn plan for a lot of prescribed fires.",
            "Prescribed fire has a rich history in the southeastern United States. Southeastern flora and fauna have evolved alongside fire on the landscape; historically, the coastal plain region experienced fire every 1-3 years! These fires were caused by both lightning and cultural burning by indigenous communities prior to European colonization. Indigenous groups used fire to clear forests for travel, herd game animals for hunting, and promote the growth of specific forage plants. Even when colonization occurred, burning was still practiced by settlers to maintain forests and agriculture. It wasn\u2019t until 1910, when the Big Blowup wildfire occurred in the Northwest, that the national conversation about fire and forest management changed. Consequently, the U.S. Forest Service launched a nationwide campaign to reduce or eliminate forest fires altogether (see Smokey Bear and Dixie Crusaders). However, unlike in the West, the fire culture was never eliminated in the South. It was greatly decreased when free range cattle ranching was made illegal, but the recent experience with using fire in the South made it easier to bring it back to public lands in the 1970s or so when the agencies finally recognized the ecological and wildfire mitigation benefits of fire. On many private lands, such as in the northern bobwhite quail hunting region of the Red Hills in northern Florida and southern Georgia, frequent prescribed burning has continued uninterrupted to the current day. In 1990, Florida signed the Prescribed Fire Act, which encouraged prescribed burning by reducing liability for certified prescribed burners, and other southern states followed suit. These are some of the reasons that prescribed fire has continued, and will continue, although with challenges, into the foreseeable future.\u00a0",
            "Absolutely. In a broad sense, there is a strong need to connect wildland fire practitioners (firefighters and prescribed burners) with the vast amount of data, information, tools, and research results in ways that can be easily used to make decisions (in the field and in the office).\u00a0 In the field, there are opportunities to connect firefighters and prescribed burners with realtime remote sensing, location tracking, fire behavior, and weather data. In the office, there are opportunities to connect a wide range of existing datasets from historical fire data, fire permit data, fuels treatments, air quality, archived weather, wildlife habitat, and more to help land managers make decisions about prescribed fire at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.\n\nIT professionals can support or work in wildland fire in a wide variety of ways. There are positions in GIS, remote sensing, database management,, field communications (radio, resource tracking, and remote networks), social media and website technology, and probably more things that I can\u2019t think of right now. Wildland fire and prescribed fire include so many different tasks, responsibilities, backgrounds, and professions, especially at the federal and state agency levels.",
            "Very much so. Here in Alberta, for example, the government uses AI for a number of functions related to wildfires: https://pivotal-with-hayete-gallot.cohostpodcasting.com/episodes/how-alberta-wildfire-uses-ai-to-suppress-fires-and-save-lives",
            "I'm not with Dr. Roberts but I have made a career out of wildland fire and have stumbled into a position where I'm regularly involved in the management strategy for wildland fire you are asking about. \n\nFrom 1910 to the late 80s, the federal government was really good at putting out fires. This has increased the amount of fuel in the ecosystem as well as decreased the health of fire adapted ecosystems. It has also impacted the severity, size, and frequency. \"Letting fires burn\" is a bit of a misnomer some Land Management Plans allow for Fire for Resource Benefit. However, these fires are still managed with a strategy other than full suppression. If firefighters aren't on the ground engaged in some sort of activity it's typically for safety reasons and not resource reasons. \n\nIn order for natural resource benefit fires to occur, things really need to line up at the local, regional, and even national level for land managers and fire management to consider it as a fire management strategy.",
            "What role does biodiversity have in making forests more fire resilient? In my area I see replanting of commercial timber being very homogeneous and very dense.",
            "You mention:\n\n\u201cIn a broad sense, there is a strong need to connect wildland fire practitioners (firefighters and prescribed burners) with the vast amount of data, information, tools, and research results in ways that can be easily used to make decisions (in the field and in the office).\u201d\n\nOutside of participating in fire ecology conferences, webinars or consortiums (which I am all for), in your professional opinion, what else could be an efficient way to connect that lack of communication between researchers & the firefighters who implement the plans?",
            "I think of appropriate fire regimes, which make forests more fire resilient, as promoting native biodiversity, rather than biodiversity making the forests more fire resilient. But they go hand in hand. Most of the terrestrial surface of the earth that we consider to be \u201cforests\u201d was not historically covered with dense forests. Tropical rain forests and bottomland forests are examples of naturally dense forests. But most areas with trees had open canopies and grassy or shrubby understories maintained by periodic fires. For example, most of the upland area of the southeastern U.S. was covered by open-canopy pine savannas, and areas with ponderosa pine and douglas pine were similarly open and park-like because of fire. This forest (or woodland, or savanna) structure lets in light that supports a high level of plant biodiversity and associated insect diversity, as well as habitat for many animals species that depend on that forest structure. The periodic fires that maintain such ecosystem structure also keep the fuel loads low, which makes them resilient to wildfire. Conversely, tree plantations typically have very low biodiversity and are prone to wildfires. There is an argument that having such areas to maximize production of forest products frees up space for other forests to be managed for maximum biodiversity, rather than trying to have forests that strike a compromise between productivity and biodiversity, but that is an open debate.\u00a0"

So is her mom. That\u2019s not a mom joke. I actually met her and she\u2019s very sweet.\n\n- Download and learn how to use virtualbox it\u2019s probably the easiest way to start. It\u2019s a virtualization software that you run essentially an operating system within an operating system. It\u2019s open North Korea\u2019s malware on my machine and that\u2019s why it could not spread absolutely anywhere.. it\u2019s useful for learning other operating systems so install Linux on there. I generally recommend Linux mint or Ubuntu. Parallels for MacOS users. If you want to real challenge, install something like freeBSD and learn how to use that.\n\n- The web application hackers handbook is the Bible Web application hacking I always tell people if you read it from cover to cover and do all of the exercises. You\u2019ll absolutely be a really good web app hacker\n\n- Black hat python by Justin is recommended. Justin is a really good dude and does some really amazing projects. I know he knows his shit. In terms of the actual content, the goal is to learn python so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t fully understand all of the attacks going on. Although he explains them really well.\n\n- for mobile, hacking I don\u2019t know fuck all about it. So ask somebody smarter than me. Georgia I mentioned earlier I did some work in there so I don\u2019t know fucking ask her.\n\n- If you\u2019re interested in macOS hacking there\u2019s just a little bit of a dated book called the macOS hackers handbook I honestly haven\u2019t read it so I can\u2019t speak to the quality, but is the absolute Jesus of macho ass hacking.\n\n- for more macOS stuff there are some books that are called. I think exploiting the macOS Colonel or maybe it\u2019s just called the macOS Colonel highly suggest those but none of these ones are for the faint of heart.\n\n- Use a lot of resources for courses. Security tube is an amazing resource watch anything by a dude named Vivek know who I\u2019m talking about. He has a bunch of shit on there. If you\u2019re starting out, look for beginners shit, go onto Udemy.\n\n- if you want to pay out the ass, but also get a certification that people actually respect there is OSCP by offensive security, but in my opinion, the shit is a little bit overrated\n\n- For programs, you can literally just download and learn right now and nmap is one of the most important ones for beginners. I think metasploit is really important and there\u2019s a shit ton of material out there on it. Learn how passwords are stored and cracking passwords. Even just knowing what that means is important. So look up hashing and no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with smoking hash, though that is an optional step\n\nI did see interest in MacOS so here:\n\n- \n\n\nwill post more soon ",

That's just the times they made me aware of. My info has appeared in other data leaks that I can't track down. And I'm very careful.\n\nYour data is ultimately yours to protect. Use strong randomized passwords and 2 factor authentication. Change your passwords often. Store data locally wherever possible. Look into the 3 2 1 backup method. Look into how to harden your browser. Don't click on ads. Don't let your phone store location data on your phone. Don't let apps access data on your phone/computer if they don't need it. Take steps to secure your own home network. Beware of what the smart TVs and speakers on your home network are actually doing. Avoid public wifi. Use a good VPN, even if you trust the network. Use email aliases. Avoid signing up for every subscription and rewards program. Don't click unknown links without scrutinizing them. Limit your social media presence so you're not easily socially engineered. Understand how to tell if a web connection is secure or not, and read into the encryption/security of different messaging platforms. Don't give information to people you aren't certain have authority and need to know, and make sure you give that info securely.\n\nThese are all little things I think everyone can do, and there are many more. It may seem like a lot but every little step counts. Data privacy is a process that one develops over time, even a little bit of security is better than none, and there will always be new threats.",

They will always limit you in some way, usually no phishing and no social engineering (tricking people by say, calling them). Then they list assets you can't touch or IP ranges you can't touch. Often those are the ones they know are vulnerable..... you usually get in anyway because the DoD is a massive organization and massive orgs work via policies and procedures which are completely defficient.\n\n  \nAnyway it's just sorta boring, you're the customer's bitch most of the time, and it's a lot of paperwork.

            "I'd say you have plenty of time and it all depends on how much you can dedicate to it. People talk about \"years of experience\" but that's not really something set in stone in terms of time. I ATE BOOKS for breakfast lunch and dinner (instead of actual food most of the time) because I was REALLY into it. I'd say read read read. Start deciding fairly early which discipline you want to go into, exploit writing, network hacking, mobile hacking, and get yourself all the books you can. Don't just buy hacking books, buy books about the internals of the operating system and read ALL about them. Fiddle around a lot. Be prepared for frustration and be ok with it. Know when to take a break. Most of all just go do it. Like NOW. Go eat books, love them, buy too many computers, experiment. Do it all, just fuck around with shit, learn the command line, learn about how memory works, learn it aaaalllllll haha. To do that you can read books or even just google around, see if you can do what they're doing.\n\n  \nLearn programming languages. Absolutely needed. At the very least a scripting language like python but would also recommend a lower-level one like C and/or C++ (the latter if you hate yourself). It's a lot, you'll be overwhelmed.

That required me to write some custom stuff and use things like slow-polling attacks (you request website info veeerrryyy slowly, taking up a lot of time for the web server), n-days (vulnerabilities that don't have an exploit so had to write them), their mail servers and other such things. Then I noticed the same two IPs showing up, so I essentially surrounded the country with servers that I rented (even some in China to see if there was some special routing). And I did a traceroute using them, if you're not familir with that it basically just tells you the route something is taking to get to a location. I noticed that no matter where you come from it always went through the same two routers.\n\n  \nTraceroute isn't a hacking tool it's a really old network admin tool (though I guess many things double as that). Normally when coming from different locations to a country it will take the shortest route possible - like if you're on the northwest of Russia it'll likely take a route into the country on the Northwest of Russia. For NK it was the same two damn routers eeeevery time, no matter where it was from. That's when I knew I had a chokepoint. So I continued to hit inside assets which is why people saw it was intermittently up and down - that's effective but not AS effective as what I did next. Which is what you're describing, I hit the two routers with a shit ton of rented bandwidth. After a while they just went completely down and any attempts to reach the country (in or out) were met with \"no route to host.\" When I saw wthat message come up I was like \"holy fucking shit\" because I knew what it meant - there was no routing to or from NK.

At first yep, it was just your basic DoS attack. Not just DDoS, they had outdated nginx servers and I found some CVEs that I could write some n-days for for memory exhaustion. That was nifty. I also hit their web servers with slow polling attacks just for additional instability. Then there was the just mass bandwidth attack (DDoS) that hit their DNS, MX, and other similar things.\n\nHowever the (kind of) unique part was that in additional reconaissance I kept noticing these two IP addresses that would come up. I assumed they were some sort of filter, maybe even a censoring filter? Although that didn't make complete sense because their people don't have access to the Internet, only the elite (aka government). So what I did was I rented a bunch of VPSs surrounding the country and some in China specifically (in case there was some special routing from there). I did a traceroute on all of them with some basic distributed computing tools. Sure enough ANYWHERE I was coming from went through those two assets. They were routers. In other words I found their only two points of egress and ingress to the country.\n\nSo I focused most of my attention on those and brought them down with again, yes, just simple bandwidth exhaustion attacks via some open ports. I made requests that would take up a lot of their bandwidth and not a lot of mine (amplifying attack). It worked, when i saw that \"no route to host\" for literally any host within country I knew I'd taken their routing completely down. It was a bit of a holy shit moment.\n\n  \nThe attack itself was absolutely not complicated. It was definitely far more complicated figuring out WHAT to attack. Most DDoS is just straightforward stupid shit, but if you take the time to understand the shape of the network it makes a huge difference as it did in this case. So nah, not that complicated, just kinda creative IMO. And no that doesn't mean i think I'm some kind of super hacker. Just that I planned well, did recon, and executed.",

Since there is no way to get them except from the department, they are a way of showing that someone is held in esteem by that group.\n\nThe origin of the coins has a few different stories but most revolve around military units using such coins as a way to prove their identity in times of war, and a tradition of \"challenging\" other members to produce their coin, which they were supposed to carry at all times.

            "A little different insight than your other replies - most countries would not have a single IP address (or two main IPs that everything routes through, like in this case).\n\nYou can get the IP address of any publicly facing device on the internet. Well, its publicly facing IP anyway. This is necessary because that's how communication works.\n\nThink of it sort of like a telephone number. Which is, by the way, an analogy that works a lot better since mobile phones became a thing.\n\nWhen you want to call or text someone, you find out their phone number. That's like their IP address. You save that with their name. On the internet, domain names are pointed to IP addresses.... you could basically say that just like you sign up for a phone, you put a domain on an IP. Don't worry about the details, it's a bit more complex and not a 1:1 thing, but it's something that is tracked. But on the internet, when your computer or phone needs to find out where a website is so it can request a webpage, it looks up the IP address in DNS.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to explain - once you save their number, you \"text\" their name, not their number, but it's actually using their number. Not their name. THat's the analogy here. You type in reddit.com and in the background, that gets converted to the IP address for reddit)\n\nYou can, for example, use a tool called \"ping\" (among many other tools) to get the IP address of a site. That's handy.\n\nThere's another tool, traceroute, that finds all the hops between you and that site. So when you talk to a web server, your request will go through hops at your local provider, across the internet, to the host's provider, and eventually to the host - the server - the website you're trying to reach.\n\nWhat he noticed was that when he was doing traceroutes to various NK servers, two IP addresses kept popping up in all of the routes. So he was able to figure out that all the traffic was going through just these two devices. Taking them down would take down everything.\n\nI hope that makes sense. :)\n\nI'm glossing over details to try and keep it simple and it already isn't. :)",

Not its job, and there are only a few people who might be persuaded to do anything about it there - meaning email the proper people to see if they care. Those few people are that little liason group the DOS has thats involved with NS stuff. It's not a question of competence, it's a question of attitude. Trust me, this attitude is not unknown - I personally have dealt with it in other agencies when I flipped leads to them, and it's entirely understandable. The agency's job is the agency's job - they aren't going to burn bandwidth on speculative stuff, possibilities, or ideas, unless that's their remit. That's just bureaucracy.\n\nSecond, there are two groups of people who would care. One is US CYBERCOM, the military guys who usually handle offensive cyberwarfare. The second is the NSA, who usually plays defense. Part of the NSAs job is to look at ideas and develop cyber defense policy. If OP wanted the government to care, he had to get it in front of them.\n\nThat said, intelligence agencies are very popular in the US, easily getting 100x the resumes they need, and being bombarded with lots of \"cool\" ideas that aren't necessarily the tools that the mission needs at that particular moment. BECAUSE this is a speculative product, meaning without verifiable intelligence in hand or an urgent need, the problem is to make them CARE.\n\nIf OP wants to get this in front of the government, talk to a cyber defense contractor and see if they're interested in a new product.... That agency has the tools to develop it (if it needs it), and the connections to get some attention to be paid. \n\nIn the meantime, the guy at the other end of the chat box just thinks \"another one\", rolls his eyes and goes back to fielding chats.",

Like if I was casing a house for a burglary and knew they never locked a certain window, then this guy goes and throws a brick through it and now it's all boarded up.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI read the wires article.  Yeah, no shit they don't want to do some of that stuff.  Official attacks require official responses.  I'm one of the advocates against some approaches to offensive cyber warfare because it's so damned easy to authorize when it seems like there will be no response.    It's a similar problem to drones.   The cost of attacking gets removed, so the frequency of the authorization for those attacks increases.

            "I read an article not long ago about how doctors should stop just throwing up their hands and resigning women to deal with the symptoms of menopause. Just deeming it as an inevitable course of biology. Rather than something that can be made much more comfortable for the sufferer.\n\nIt focused on how we shouldn't consider the negative effects and general unwellness associated with menopause as something that can only be tolerated, in terms of medical \"treatment\".\n\nI suspect a large reason for this attitude stems from this apparent rareness of doctors who understand menopause. Especially in the field of medicine, which is dominated largely by men, who just by virtue of their lack of first hand experience don't appreciate what women have to go through to the degree that a woman would.\n\nWe have made leaps and bounds in progress towards getting menopause, PMS, and other hormonal issues related to female biology being taken more seriously compared to, say, the 60s or 70s. Especially with female doctors being more common these days.\n\nUnfortunately, we still have a very long way to go before we get to a place that, at least I, would consider acceptable. Much less the wider community.\n\nFor context, I should point out that I am a \\~40 year old male. So, I can't help but feel kind of out of place. But, these are just my opinions. I don't expect/demand anyone agree with them, or anything of that nature. I'm just expressing them in a matter-of-factly way.",

The disparity that is often discussed as it pertains to maternal mortality extends to every phase of Black women's lives.

There is so much that needs to change when it comes to our healthcare system. We need more culturally sensitive physicians and healthcare professionals. We need better awareness of the lived experience of our individual patients. We need to address the implicit and explicit biases in care delivery and testing--more research.  It's a lot, and it will take time in this challenging healthcare environment. Until then, I address what each of us can do right here and right to ensure that we get the care we need.",
            "Supplements should be thought of as just that--supplements. There is no evidence that they actually \"treat\" anything. There is no duty to prove effectiveness or to actually prove that what they say is in them actually is. Use supplements if you don't have a well balanced diet. Take a multivitamin, Calcium or Vitamin D if you don't get these things in your diet. If you have documented vitamin or mineral deficiency, take a supplement. I would not recommend any supplement to \"treat\" any condition. The most effective treatment for the symptoms of menopause is hormone therapy (estrogen and/or estrogen and progesterone). A healthy diet, regular exercise, a good night's sleep, and cutting back on alcohol are always good places to start. A good rule of thumb is this--if you're spending more on supplements than you spend on a good healthy meal at your favorite restaurant, you're probably spending too much.",
            "Now you're about to get me in trouble here. :-) Let me say this, I think midwives are great. And believe it or not, I was actually born at home. That being said as an obstetrician, I have seen some things go south pretty quickly, and I was glad to be in a hospital with the ability to get what I needed in a hurry. Home deliveries for healthy women with no complications usually go well, but when they don't, and you can't always predict when that happens, I'd rather my patients be in the hospital. So, midwives are not the problem. In fact, I think this is the direction we are heading because we have a serious shortage of physicians. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Just be aware of what the possible downsides are. As doctors, our mantra is expect the best, and prepare for the worst.",
            "The latest is this \u2014if you are already on hormones, there is no reason to stop simply due to age. For new starts, the conversation is more nuanced. For those who start hormones  before 60 or within 10 years of their last period, the benefits outweigh the risks. Bottom line, whether you should start HRT after 65 really depends upon your personal health history and your treatment goals. So it depends. But anyone at any age can use vaginal estrogen and probably should.",

            "Women do produce testosterone throughout their lives, but it does not drop as precipitously as estrogen and progesterone after menopause. Testosterone levels start to drop for most women in their mid-thirties. While there is observational data that suggests that testosterone may be helpful for maintenance of muscle mass, improved libido and in some instances depression, it has not been as well studied as estrogen. Currently there are no FDA approved testosterone preparations in the United States for women. Testerone preparations for women are mostly compounded for this reason. This has of course impeded research. Testosterone is also considered a controlled substance (like narcotics) and cannot be prescribed in an online environment. Unlike estrogen, testosterone levels in women do need to be monitored while taking to ensure that the levels stay in the normal range for women. Some of the adverse effects of testosterone are irreversible."

            "I'm having a first crack at a book and have hired an editor myself and currently have rewritten my manuscript once, now onto a third round of edits, which has been roughly 3 years of work. I had assumed self publishing was the easiest way to get my book out there once done however reading your post has made me reconsider. What advice would you give someone like me who may want to now go through a publisher, but has started a lot of the work myself such as hiring an editor (who I am working well with), cover artist etc?",
            "What is the process typically like for a book that ends up getting adapted to the screen?",
            "Hey there! I published a novel with a small publishing house, and the experience was illuminating regarding the \"business\" of the publishing industry. I know every company has its strengths/weaknesses and operates a little differently, so feel free to tell me if I'm off base, but I found that one of the biggest challenges was marketing and in-industry connections. \n\nThe draw of traditional publishing for many, I feel, is the belief that a publishing house will open up more doors and get a book out there. However, from my own experience and what I hear from similar authors, this is not necessarily the case, as the Big Five (and other big publishers) are really the only ones who can pull that sort of weight in marketing and publicity. This is not to say that small publishers don't publicize or have working relationships in the industry--I certainly saw more coverage and, in turn, sales than I would have on my own, and I'm grateful for my publisher's work. But it seems that that the onus of marketing falls increasingly to the authors themselves, these days.\n\nSo, my question is two-fold: \n\n- If this is true (and correct me if I'm wrong), then what advantages for marketing and publicity *do* small publishers offer, which should appeal to would-be authors who might otherwise consider self-publishing? \n\n- Do you believe this trend will continue, where the power of in-industry marketing will becoming increasingly centralized to only the \"big\" houses, and where all other publishers will increasingly rely on authors marketing themselves as a brand?",

            "Hi Samantha. You're always welcome to send an email into our Publishing Manager with a link to your portfolio. What we usually do is add you and your portfolio to a list that we keep that we consult when we have a new title coming up. \n\nRight now most of our covers are designed by Luke Bird, Emma Ewbank and Tom Etherington who are all really brilliant. The pool of designers tends to expand whenever there's a crunch and nobody has availability to take on a new cover in time so we have to go looking for someone new.",
            "I'm not against self-publishing and if an author feels that is the best way forward for them then all power to them. \n\nI would say that if you are going to self-publish then you need to be aware that you are taking on the role of both author and publisher. Publishing is not just making the work available and I'm sure many people who do self-publish successfully can attest to how much work they put in to running a publishing business. It isn't easy to do and those who make a success of it put a lot of work into that side of things. Nobody in publishing underestimates what it takes to succeed in that space.\n\nWhat we do is we pay an advance to an author so that they are earning straight away. The money always flows from publisher to author. We never ask for money from the author and no reputable publisher should.\n\nWe take a manuscript and work with the author through several rounds of editing to make that work the best it can be. Then we design and package that work to have the best chance it can within the market using our expertise and experience. \n\nWe have a distributor and a sales team. The books we sell are sold it to high street bookshops across the country and online and achieve physical visibility within those bookshops. Our books are on the shelves and on the display tables. \n\nWe have publicity and marketing in-house. Every book we publish has a campaign to back it up that works in conjunction with the distributor and sales team. For instance, if we get a review in a newspaper then that is passed to the sales team and to book buyers. Advance copies of our books go out to booksellers at big chain bookstores and independents ahead of publication as well as their respective head offices. \n\nLikewise, book reviewers and book page editors get advance copies of our copies and are pitched to for features. Book influencers are pitched to and sent advance copies too. \n\nWe work to further exploit audio, territory and translation as well as other subsidiary rights as well as dramatic where we represent them for the titles we publish. This means regularly attending national and international bookfairs, meeting with editors, agents, scouts, film and TV producers, etc.\n\nThis results in new advances for our authors. \n\nSo whereas someone self-publishing is left to do this themselves we have a team of people working full-time on all of this bringing our experience, expertise and professional relationships to the author's benefit.",
            "That probably depends on a few different things. Do you want to know the best route to getting published in general or getting published specifically by Dead Ink? And we're talking fiction, right? Also worth getting an idea of what you want from being published\u00a0\u2014 literary cred, bestseller, long career.   \n  \nIf you can give me a couple of specifics about what you are aiming for I'll try give you the best advice I can.",
            "In the UK we are probably coming out of a bit of a golden age for independent publishing. Several incredible presses started or hit their stride pre-pandemic: Influx Press, Galley Beggar, Fitzcarraldo, And Other Stories. \n\nSince the pandemic things have become really tough and a number of independents have had to close their doors. We are very much not in a golden age right now and we're expecting things to get much tougher. The cost of printing has skyrocketed and a lot of the people we work with have understandably had to increase their fees. Couple that with the cost-of-living crisis where people have less money to spend and we're all getting squeezed from both sides. But then, everyone in the UK is right now, right?\n\nThis probably isn't a very exciting answer if you're UK based as it is the same thing that everyone is saying, but it is really tough at the moment and I'd encourage everyone to support the independent businesses that they love because they probably really need it right now.",
            "I would ask yourself this: do you want to be an author or an author AND a publisher?\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer, but think about what you honestly want. And how you want to spend your time. Some people honestly love the publishing part of self-publishing and excel at it, but other writers can't stand that side of things. \n\nAlso be honest with yourself about what you are realistically going to consider a success when it comes to releasing the book \u2014 number of readers? Reviews? Broadsheet reviews? Money? Visibility? Stocked in bookshops?\n\nAgain, no right or wrong answer. But what do you want to get out of it?\n\nThen ask yourself how you are going to achieve that. That could be self-publishing with a solid plan behind it or it could be getting picked up by a big corporate publisher. Maybe you want that middle ground with an independent where it is a bit more personable. But you should define that and take the best way forward based on that. \n\nA freelance editor having worked on your book isn't a problem if you do take the traditional path. They might appreciate a thank you in the acknowledgements though!\n\nAnd a traditional publisher is going to provide their own cover regardless.\n\nIf you do take the traditional path remember that money always flows from the publisher to the author \u2014 never the other way round.",
            "There are a variety of ways this can happen, but it tends to look something like this.\n\nSomebody, usually a producer, but it could be a screenwriter, director, or even someone like an actor if they have significant sway, becomes aware of a book and like it. They then usually get in touch with the publisher or the author's agent to ask who represents the dramatic rights. And it is usually one of those two depending on the contract. More often than not the author retains the dramatic rights and it is their agent or a specialist agent acting on behalf of their agent who represents them. In independent publishing it can often enough be the publisher and we've done this ourselves many times.\n\nOnce it is established who is representing the rights, whoever is interested will try and get an option on them. An option is the exclusive right to 'have the option' of making the film. This means that they can put a project together and try to get funding for that project without having to compete with anyone. It is usually time limited to a year or two and when that expires they are presented with renewing the option or letting it lapse and everyone parting ways. If they let it lapse then someone else is then free to option. \n\nWhen the option is negotiated all of the terms are decided about who get's what percentages and fees etc. These contracts are usually very complex and try to be watertight to cover all eventualities. When it is first optioned there is a fee agreed upon for the option and subsequent fees agreed to renew the option when the time comes. \n\nI actually know of one instance (not at Dead Ink thankfully) where an author got so fed up with the back and forth of the film people and the complexity of the contract that they got a solicitor to give their publisher power of attorney to deal with it without bothering them. This isn't at all common and the author and publisher were very close with their relationship going back decades. \n\nFamously, I think it was JG Ballard bragged about how he used to live off the option fees for all of his books getting renewed every year. The films were never getting made, but nobody wanted to give them up so he made a nice living from it. \n\nWhilst a producer or production company has the option they are putting together a sort of package where they bring talent onboard and attract funders. At this stage people like the BBC or a studio could get involved too. \n\nThe option agreement will have clauses in it that extend and become more firm as this progresses until it becomes a sure thing (there is never a sure thing in TV and film) going into pre-production and production etc. \n\nThere are hundreds of ways this can all come together and play out in reality, but it is incredibly difficult for something to get all the way through the process. Plenty of books get optioned, but very few overall make it to production.",
            "The problem with the label of 'independent publisher' is that it covers a lot. So you have your one person outfit all the way to the likes of Bloomsbury and Faber who are part of the Independent Alliance. That's a huge spread and experiences throughout that are going to vary drastically. \n\nI wouldn't say that marketing and publicity is concentrating in the Big 5 (or 4) \u2014 quite the opposite actually. The bigger publishers are focussing more on certain hits. So that's books from authors with a well established track records or celebrity name appeal. Although this isn't completely true because there are some imprints producing excellent work. Being with a big publisher is no guarantee that you wll get marketing and publicity support.\n\nWhat's really the problem is that traditional space for coverage on books is vanishing. The magazine and newspaper industries have been hit hard over recent years, so there aren't that many places where traditional publicity coverage for books is still available. We have to fight tooth and nail for everything that we get and we are proud of track record with publicity, but every year there are less and less opportunities. \n\nWhere independents have really succeeded is getting buy-in from book influencers online. A good example is Influx's *Boy Parts* by Eliza Clarke. That book became a hit because it found an audience on TikTok. Independents tend to be good at getting their books to the right audience in the right way. From there, they can break out. \n\nAnd to look at the whole author-as-a-brand question, I think that becomes a bigger social question about how we all engage with culture these days. \n\nIn a lot of ways, social media did a lot of damage to the world of books, but it also helped a lot. A lot of very prominent independent publishers got started because they were able to find an audience on social media, but magazines and newspapers found their revenue streams eroded by those same platforms. In a way, they brought democracy, but they also broke the traditional pipelines and workflows for success. \n\nNot sure if I actually answered your question or not there.",
            "I'm afraid that we don't have a poetry list. We have in the past published some poetry, but we felt that it wasn't something we were doing well and others were much better at it.\n\nA large proportion of our authors are debuts though or began with us as debuts and building an author's career from that starting point is something that we think we do particularly well. We've had many authors start with us and go on to get major publishing deals at big publishers attracting significant and sizeable advances.",
            "We don't intend to produce or publish AI generated content.   \n  \nI've seen that places like Clarkesworld have had some serious issues with their open submissions windows being spammed with AI content intended to deceive them and that's a real shame as open submissions are already so rare and it was a great thing that they were keeping that going. \n\nWith the way that we receive potential work to publish I don't think it will be an issue for us in the near future, but in the longer term? Possibly. We've just recently started including clauses related to AI content into our contracts, so it is becoming an issue already I suppose.\n\nIn the end, we're here to publish work by authors and to support those authors to develop their careers, so that's going to be our priority.",
            "I would always advise against writing to market unless you are already established and write very quick.\n\nBy the time your book is acquired and published it is likely that at least a year or two will have gone by. The market will have moved on. Always write to your own strengths and passions, because that is what is going to show off your talents. If you chase the market you'll just end up spinning in circles. Show us what only you can write!\n\nRight now there is a big demand for high-concept or 'literary' horror. (This is in part because of a lot of work done by independents, but I digress!) Usually you can get an idea of what the big 'thing' of the moment is that acquiring editors are looking for by news stories in the trade magazines around the time of the big book fairs \u2013 London, Frankfurt etc. But again, these stories are aimed at people in the trade and not authors. It is very difficult to write to market effectively and if you are just starting out it is unlikely to work out for you.",
            "The projects that have been the most risky and outside of the usual way of publishing things, like *the Eden Book Society*, have all come from in-house passion. When they are a lot of risk and a lot of work I think that's the only way they can get across the finish line. There has to be a personal desire to make it work. That isn't to say we don't develop a sound business plan around them, but I don't think that something like *the Eden Book Society* can see the light of day unless the motivation is personal. There are easier ways to make a living, so something else has to be the motivator.",
            "Also, thank you for thinking we're awesome!",
            "Hey! No, not too late all.\n\nWhat you're describing does happen, but it is largely confined to non-fiction. In non-fiction books can be acquired based on the strength of a proposal and that happens quite a lot, but it can be difficult for a new author.\n\nIn fiction, for a new author this rarely happens unless it is on the basis of a book that has already been written and is part of a multi-book deal. So a published may give you an advance for a pre-existing book and a second book that has yet to be written. It might also happen if you're also very established as an author and have a track record. \n\nIn terms of your book specifically, I would say that coffee table books are a whole specialised area in themselves. They're a very particular niche of the industry. My experience is predominantly on what is called trade publishing, so I might be a bit out of my depth when it comes to this area. \n\nIf you wanted help there's a site called Reedsy where publishing professional offer there services freelance. I don't know if that's available in Greece or not, but might be worth looking up?",
            "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb some publishing houses don\u2019t accept unsolicited emails so I thought I\u2019d better check. Your covers are amazing and I\u2019d love to be considered alongside the very talented designers that you are working with already when they don\u2019t have availability. I really admire their work and your company.",
            "Fantastic answer, thank you.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Thanks so much for the detailed and thoughtful response. And yes, \"independent publisher\" includes a vast range of outfits. It's further conflated by the terms \"indie author\" or \"indie published\" now used colloquially by many to mean self-published, so the waters are muddied when it comes to what independent even means. \n\nRegarding your qualification on how the Big Five focus their efforts vs. small presses, I appreciate the insight. It's interesting that you're adapting to the times, actually. I figured that social media influence was either relegated to organic trends or those paid-for by authors, but it's somewhat heartening to know that publishers also have the wherewithal to leverage social media. \n\nI think everything you've said here makes sense, and it will be interesting to see how the democratization of book publishing and marketing pans out for small presses in the long run. You definitely answered my question. :) Thanks!",
            "Thank you for your reply!",
            "Thank you, that's really useful to hear.",

            "Thank you! If you're based in Merseyside then be sure to keep up to date on the events at our bookshop. We've had really informative discussion panels from cover designers before, so I'm sure we will repeat that format as the audience loved it.",
            "I'll try and keep my advice as general as possible, so that it as useful as possible. If you or anyone else want specifics or have follow up questions then feel free to quiz me some more. This is a big topic so I'm going to miss stuff.\n\nFirst of all, don't worry that you have a job that pays the bills \u2013 most authors do and very few are able to support themselves solely from writing. There are many reasons for this, but for anyone reading this please don't think that you aren't a 'proper' writer because you've got a day job. If you write then you are proper writer. \n\nI think the first thing that would help someone get published is to learn the industry. That is to say, the business side of things. Very few new writers understand how it all works and frankly this is the fault of the publishing industry itself \u2014 it is dreadful at transparency. \n\nIf you can afford it, consider something like a subscription to The Bookseller. You'll learn names, companies, industry news and what's happening. Twitter used to be where the industry congregated online and you could keep up with what was happening just by engaging with the right people, but that no longer seems to be the case. Right now there doesn't seem to be an established public square for the industry. \n\nPay attention to where the books you are reading are coming from. The spine and the back of the book will list the imprint that published the book. Inside, you'll find more detailed information on the verso page that will list what company that imprint belongs to. From here you'll probably start getting an idea of the imprints and publishers that are putting out work that you like. You can also search online for the literary agents of authors you like and that will give you an idea of who represents the sort of thing that you're looking for. \n\nVery few places offer open submissions these days \u2014 that is, submissions where anyone can send in work. We try and have a window at least once a year where we solicit un-agented work. For your work to get seen, particularly by a big publisher, you are likely to need a literary agent. Now, getting a literary agent can be as hard as getting published, so I know this might seem ridiculous advice, but do make sure you are looking to send work to them. Most will have a page on their agency website saying if they are open for new work and also listing what they specialise in. \n\nAnother tip which is often missed is this: support the work that you want to see. If you can, go to events featuring authors you like. Both new and established. You never know who you'll run into and what connections you will make. Publishing is actually a pretty small word and everybody tends to know each other. \n\nIf you write short fiction then getting that published in various places can help a lot. The job of editors and agents is to find new talent so they all have their favourite places that they go looking for it. Small steps can make a big difference. Similarly, writing things like reviews or doing book stuff on social media can get your foot in the door with forming relationships. \n\nThis is a pretty long post of dubious utility so I'll finish here for now, but my advice would be to learn as much as you're willing about the industry and try to make yourself a small part of it in some way. Easier said than done, I know. \n\nIf anyone wants any more detail here or has questions then I can give more.",
            "Publishers enjoy nothing more than talking about what is wrong with publishing!",

            "My 12 year old son has albinism, and doesn\u2019t like that he is different. He\u2019s adopted and a different race than we are, so he has a lot of reasons to feel different. Therefore he resists wearing his prescription sunglasses when we are out, and getting him to put on sunblock, even on sunny days is sometimes a battle. Right now we are making the sunblock and a hat non-negotiable, but letting him choose his eyewear. I empathize with his feelings, but his physical health is important too. Do you have any advice for how to manage his feelings on this? Did you deal with anything similar?",
            "I'm also albino. Honestly the hardest part with it for me was not being accepted by my own people. I'm Hispanic. What I really struggled with was the racist comments in Spanish from Hispanic people to shortly after realize that I in fact do understand them and am not what they thought. The sunblock, the glasses, the announce of being fair skinned never bothered. It's always been the unacceptance of those that should be accepting me. Colorism.\n\nHave you faced anything similar? If not what's something that you feel you struggle with that's not the classic things.",

What really helped me was just meeting other people with albinism, both online and at NOAH conferences; there's actually a conference next month in San Diego if you can make it! Peer acceptance can also be a big thing, I know I refused to use magnifiers and monoculars and glasses because it felt embarrassing in front of my classmates, not necessarily because I hated being different. Though when I did, everyone was super jealous and wanted to see my giant textbook or play with my magnifier, which helped. And I'm sure it's also just typical \"so what?\" attitude you have when you're younger. So what I don't brush my teeth, what's the worst that can happen?",

My dermatologist recommended the colorscience brand, but I also like the brush on block.\n\nI'm not albino, I only have experience with this because my dad had aggressive melanoma so I wear a lot of sun protection but absolutely hate the feel of sunblock and how it makes me break out so this is a great alternative.",
            "Hmm, what are some examples of racist comments you've gotten? Older Mexican ladies will comment to each other about my fair skin *all the time* thinking I don't understand them. And then they're all shocked when I bust out my perfect Spanish. But I mean it's typical gossip, kinda inherent to the culture; we commentate on people walking down the street all the time. \"Mira que bajos tiene los pantalones se le ve la nalga\"\n\nAnd I mean you'll get \"guero\" \"gabacho\" \"gringo,\" but I always interpreted them as kinda... affectionate? Like that's just shit Mexicans say man, I never interpreted it as racist. I've never had anyone actual like deny me service or refuse to speak to me or anything like that, in English or Spanish. Shit, I've had Mexican people who were *weary* of me when I spoke to them in English but totally loosened up when I busted out the Spanish. I mean of course they're curious about how I speak Spanish so well and where I'm from and so on, they *always* ask. But I've never had anyone be prejudiced.",

I do use Japanese sunscreen because I like it better but basically anything out there would work fine. For eyes simple sunglasses will do.

            "> What's the craziest story involving your albinism?\n\nBuckle up buckaroo!\n\nI used to live next to an oil and lube place, think like Jiffy Lube. I had to walk by this place to get to the bus stop, pharmacy, restaurants, etc. but I mean I just walked by and never paid much attention to the business. One day I'm walking by to get lunch and the employees start yelling **\"HEY WHITEY\"** as loud as they possibly could. I just ignored them since, well, it's not like it's the first time I've had someone point out my difference.\n\nExcept they kept doing it, and I started to develop this really bad anxiety walking past (and remember, I *had* to). Like mentally I wasn't really bothered but physiologically my heart would race, I would sweat, tense up. *Are they going to yell it this time? How loud? How many of them? How many times?* I started going the long way round, or waiting until they closed before I would go out. But I had to do something, I couldn't do this forever.\n\nMy solution was to post a negative Yelp review. I didn't know about Google Maps reviews at the time so it was the best I could do. The next day one of their employees came out to the sidewalk to try to talk to me as I walked past but I ignored him. At least, the shouting had stopped for good. But the story doesn't end there!\n\nDown the street was a restaurant that I frequented, and I was friends with the manager who lived nearby, and the lube shop employees knew we were friends because they'd seen us talking to each other. So someone from the shop goes into her restaurant and asks her to ask me to take the review down because they're \"losing business\" and \"it's not his fault, it was the white employees doing it.\"\n\nEventually Yelp took the review down since it didn't reflect an actual experience with the business, like as a customer. And eventually the lube place changed names, though I don't know if the employees changed. My only regret is not recording it at least once, I really should have. My other idea was to contact the media and have them do like a sting operation to record it happening, but I don't imagine they would have cared very much. Maybe someday those people will come public and detail just what the hell they were thinking.",

            "We're fairly certain my great grandfather had albinism because of his general description of having white skin and blue eyes (which would be exceedingly unusual for where he lived) but without any photographs or DNA it's impossible to know for sure.

            "I personally won't be having kids so it's not a concern for me, but I did think about it a lot when I still entertained the possibility. On one hand, albinism can be a struggle and so why would you voluntarily give your child a condition you know is going to make their life difficult? On the other hand, we live at a time with a ton of adaptive technology and a (generally) more accepting and understanding populace. Additionally, who better to raise a child with albinism than another person with albinism? I mean not to knock any parent of a child with albinism, but unless you have it you'll never really *understand* what it's like. Even my parents don't.\n\nIf I was going to approach the problem now I'd just have my partner undergo genetic testing.",

            "My doctor had this to say, \"Melanotan is an imitator (analog) not of melanin, but of one of the hormones that stimulates melanin production. No publications have been listed that report its us in albinism. However, it may be reasonable to study this possibility at some point. It would only work in cases where stimulating the melanocyte could result in greater pigment production. Therefore, it would be unlikely to work in a person with OCA-1A.\"\n\nEssentially, humans have a melanin synthesis pathway that starts with L-tyrosine > L-DOPA > DOPAquinone > so on. Different types of albinism cause problems at different points in this process. So melanotan works by stimulating hormones at one point in this synthesis, but if L-tyrosine is dysfunctional then it doesn't matter. If you're not producing enough L-DOPA then it wouldn't make a difference. So it would depend on the person and where things went wrong in their melanin synthesis.\n\nWith that said it's not something I've personally tried and I don't know anyone with albinism who's tried it. Worth a shot tho, right? Is it like prescription or can I just get it on Amazon?",

It's the double standard that's always bothered me. I struggle with my own ethnicity and heritage because I've been commented on my entire life.

Is it having to undergo different treatment than other kids? Is it bullying? Is it a lack of acceptance? Is it not being able to do what other kids do? Like there's a lot of nuance and so it's hard to really know the best approach without knowing what exactly bothers him.\n\nLike for me I knew I was different and I did have to have adaptive stuff and whatnot, but kids still treated me the same. I still felt normal even though I knew I wasn't. I just couldn't stand wearing hats or applying sunscreen. I hated any and all glasses, I still do actually. It had nothing to do with being different I just didn't like them, like how some people just flat out refuse to wear watches or necklaces.\n\nNot being a parent myself it's really hard to give advice, but drawing on my psychology / child development background, I know that forcing stuff likely won't end well and would just breed resentment.

Due to the effect on melanin production, people with albinism are particularly affected by cancers linked to UV-irradiation as you know. Ultimately it comes down to DNA-repair mechanisms, with some SCC target groups having genetically impaired repair function or in the case of OCA high mutation rates in repair mechanism factors like p53 (tumor suppressor) through UV absorption of keratinocytes (main skin cells in epidermis) causing impaired repair function, uncontrolled cell replication, and finally cancer. \n\nRegarding the sunscreen question, I don't know if any studies have been done on this, but since the rate of SCC is proportional to the accumulated quantum of absorbed UVR by keratinocytes, it should follow the trend in this case. If someone with albinism religiously applied sunscreen and minimized frequent unprotected sun exposure, the risk of SCC and BCC should be greatly reduced. However, people with albinism still run a greater risk of SCC even with diligent sunscreen use due to the difficulty of achieving full UV protection. Even when comparing black people with albinism to Caucasians the rate of SCC is significantly higher with OCA, and it is also as you say that lack of access to preventative measures and education on the matter is a primary cause for the occurrence of SCC malignancies.",

Of course as with any human cohort study it's difficult to know which circumstances caused these observations. It's likely that people with vitiligo are more aware of their skin and its abnormalities, and that they may take more preventative measures for skin cancer. Also, vitiligo patients have a higher expression of p53 (cell cycle arrest -> anti cancer).",

I also don't miss people, and I rarely take photos. I have to set myself reminders to contact the people that I love otherwise I just sort of forget they exist. WhatsApp has been a great thing for me as all of the conversations are so easy to pick up!\nI definitely like to read film synopsis either during or immediately after.\nI however like rewatching or re reading things, and frequently have no idea I've seen it before until quite a long way through. \n\nOne question: do you get emotional at all when you remembr things? I don't with one exception: I feel angry if I remember people who made me angry. I don't know what they looked like and I still can't bring up the situation (like you it's stories only) but I will feel a bit aggravated. I don't get this with sad or stressful memories.

I'm obviously in the latter group. The people in the former group probably have something going on specifically with their fusiform face areas -- that's an almond-sized chunk of brain just above your ears that is specifically devoted to human face recognition! \n\nThere's a famous case of a man who lost his ability to recognize humans after a stroke damaged his FFA, so he moved from london to the countryside because he was so embarrassed about accidentally snubbing people. He became a shepherd, and he soon realized that he was able to tell his new sheep apart by their faces alone! But he never recovered the ability to remember human faces.",

To deal with this, I take a lot of photos of myself with loved ones, and then I put them on rotation as phone and computer wallpaper. It helps a lot!

(This was in the early aughts.) She used it to repeatedly call her boyfriend in Canada, and wracked up hundreds of dollars on my phone bill! When I found out, she paid me back and apologized. Then, three months later, she asked to borrow my pin again just one time, and I let her! and she wracked up hundreds of dollars again! When this happened for the third time, the phone administrator lady at my college was like, can you write yourself a note or something?

This is because I have an unrelated visual procssing disorder known as amblyopia. Watching movies is very effortful for me; I especially can't follow fast-paced action scenes.

Mutual friends say I run into him all the time and don't realize it, so I remain cool as a cucumber whereas if I did recognize him I'd freak out!\n\nIt also helps that, these days, I'm unashamed to come out and ask people who the heck they are.

Recently someone asked me about some plans I'd made and I was brought back to the moment where I made the plans - it was in my car with a specific friend at a specific intersection, it was a sunny day - but I couldn't quite remember what was said; I tried to close my eyes and focus on the memory to see if I could recall it. Another example, I was having an argument and my partner said something that made me feel very hurt; ten minutes later I remembered the hurt and I could visualize exactly where and how I was standing and she was sitting when the thing was said, but I had totally forgotten the actual comment.\n\nIf you asked me to recall a time in my life, the things that come to me are images of places, people I cared about, emotions. Very much vibes first. If you asked me for a story, it will probably be short and based on an image memory, or fairly generalized - \"we would do XYZ a lot\". Now I definitely can and do construct narratives that I remember, and there are plenty of important stories from my life that I can recall, but it's not my default.\n\nNow, I have a very good spatial memory (if I navigate somewhere with a map I can usually navigate back without it), and a good memory for concepts I understand. But I have wondered if I'm somehow losing my memory because of times when I've totally forgotten details that aren't associated with visual stimuli.\n\nOh here's another wacky example - if I'm daydreaming in the shower I can never remember washing my face! It's routine to do it after I wash my body, but my eyes are closed and I'm not passively recording memory, I'm thinking about something else entirely. If I'm present and narrate it consciously (say \"now I'm washing my face\" in my head) I can remember.

Very much not in line with how I'd always been, but it was the least of my troubles with that girlfriend so I ignored it even though it was happening more and more.\n\nAbout 9 years ago there was some even more extremely emotional event that I won't get into, and I remember feeling my brain just *snap*, and my life being very clearly divided into before - when my entire life was one continuous line of vivid memory - and after - when things have a very hard time sticking in my memory, and the things that do stick are just detached stories and factoids.\n\nAnd now reading about your experience has me worried that what I've been experiencing is an actual... um... thing.",

The more I try consciously to visualize, the more obvious that my visual memory and imagination isn't anything like seeing something with my eyes.\n\nWhen I found out about the aphantasia spectrum it was a relief because I had always struggled with \"guided meditation\" and similar that relied on \"imagine yourself at a beach\" and so on. The online resources/community seem to be geared towards only people with \"pure\" aphantasia, which I can understand, but just knowing that it's a spectrum was reassuring that it wasn't something I was doing wrong when I failed to picture something or when trying to picture something didn't relax me.\n\nHowever my auditory memory and imagination is stellar. I can still 100% tell that something is coming from my \"mental ear\" rather than my physical ears but I can not only accurately remember both voices and sounds, but I can also accurately imagine what eg someone's voice might sound like saying something I've never heard them say. I'm very good at imitating people's accents, the rhythm of the speech, word choices, tones, pauses, etc, and when I'm asked how I do it, I answer honestly: I hear it in my head and then I just copy it.

I get songs stuck in my head a LOT, including instrumental music.\n\nI don't really have a question to go with this, I just think it's amazing how many things were finding out that are only scratching the surface about human neurodiversity\u2014especially about the things that aren't a priority to research.",

            "The best way I've found to describe it is I experience my memories as if you were actively watching a movie. Not only that but I can recreate the entire memory in my \"minds eye\" and assume the role of a third person camera. I remember what I looked like then and where people were, I remember where furniture was, colors, sounds, smells, feelings. I also can recreate parts of that memory that weren't experienced first person because I have a strong memory of things that weren't in visual, for example if I recall a memory in the living room I can then go into the bedroom, kitchen, etc during the same memory based on recall of my experience of those rooms in the same day, or time frame. I can remember tv playing in the other room, conversations, etc. Not with total 100% accuracy as HSAM does not equate to a picture perfect memory, but some people do have both. I'd say I'm fairly close.\n\nHow do you know someone with hsam isn't just making up details? Well, you can't, so we use some metrics like the amount of detail you can recall within a certain time frame versus a control group, and then also on days where public events took place, such as 911, OJ Simpson trial, etc. Not everyone will have experienced the same public events so theres a lot of room for interpretation.\n\nThere are times when I recall memory and it's so vivid in my mind that my actual vision and hearing of the current moment will switch off and stop recording, so to speak. I remember faces really well but I have a hard time remember names and things like phone numbers, I wouldn't call those autobiographical memories though. In fact there's a study that says people with HSAM, given 2 minutes to recall something, do no better than an average person without.\n\nSo basically, the best way to describe it is I experience my memories as if you were watching a movie.\n\nIt's also for this reason I can't bear to watch a movie more than once unless I really really like it, then a few times and I can't anymore.",

My brain is kinda all over the map, really--I have extremely treatment-resistant depression, I have REM behavior disorder, I have some of the autistic sensory processing stuff going on. All that stuff is way more of a problem. I'm seeing the neurologist primarily to talk about the REM behavior disorder and my concern about my risk of Parkinson's.\n\nI guess I'm not convinced it would be better to have more memories, or sharper ones.

            "Was thinking the same thing.  I know I have aphantasia, wonder if they're just closely related--not being able to visualize the past would probably remove most of the \"richness\" from the memory.\n\nBut like aphantasia, I struggle to think of it as a \"disorder\"--I feel like this is all just on the perfectly normal spectrum of brain activity.  People just don't tend to know how other people's brains work, because how could they?  It's only now that we're so interconnected via the internet that we can easily share our experiences.  Some people can make mental pictures.  Maybe even mental videos?  Others can't.  \n\nPersonally, my memory is very unconscious--things are usually triggered by smells or sounds or \"deja vu\", and when I think of things, they're not pictures, but they're...something hard to describe.  And always third-person mental non-visual \"snapshots\".  \n\nIt's helpful to know this stuff, because it can explain things about a person, obviously.  Prior to even discovering the phenomenon of aphantasia, my wife would get very frustrated by my driving.  She'd constantly have to navigate, even to places I've been a few times.  Because her brain can connect pieces visually.  Me, I have to learn a route and remember visual landmarks.  Though when I do, I remember them forever, regardless of complexity, and don't ever need GPS.  Same with facts and trivia--I excelled in school because I have an excellent memory.\n\nWhen I lived in NYC, I could get anywhere from my apartment easily.  But getting from one destination to another was a struggle because my brain didn't fit the pieces together visually.  It's like I was constantly surprised to find that simply walking a few blocks would connect the East Village to Union Square, or Greenwich to Chelsea.  Eventually I knew which direction I would need to wander in, but I could never confidently make it from one point to the next--I'd have to get close and then reorient.\n\nBrains are funny.",

            "In 1990 I went to Europe. I can remember being at a palace in Austria where they filmed the \u201cDo-a-deer\u201d scene out of the Sound of Music. \n\nI know that as a fact, but when I recall that occasion in some ways it\u2019s as though I am inside a transporter beam, able to experience that moment as though I could just drop in on that time and space. It doesn\u2019t feel like an all-encompassing reality. I never lose sight of the present world around me looking out the window into my back yard. But it\u2019s as though part of my memory really can use a transporter beam and I have a visual sense of that moment in the same way as being there. I also have a visual sense of even looking at photos of that moment years later, which is distinct from my memory of the moment itself. \n\nIt feels unreal and trivial compared to the real world I see in front of me. But also as though I have access to this other time and place as though it were in another dimension, and if I pay attention to the memory long enough the actual world in front of me diminishes in significance and the other reality of this memory becomes clearer visually and easier to focus on. And the experience of being there back then becomes not quite \u201creal\u201d as though I were literally standing there, but still very vivid and akin to observing that moment visually once again. \n\nI think I experience that more with sights and sounds. I still experience it with scents and flavours though this post has given me the opportunity to reflect on how I do recall scents and flavours and I think it\u2019s diminished over time. The fact that I like a given food seems more apparent to me now as a fact, than recall of the actual flavour or texture. On that same trip to Europe I ate a steak at a roadside stop in Austria, and it was one of the best I\u2019d ever eaten before or since. For years if I thought of that moment it almost felt like I was tasting the steak again. Now it has receded more into a fact that I just recall enjoying it, without any other sensory  character to that memory other than being able to picture the table at which we ate and the view out the windows and the general decor of the place. Those visuals are sensory in the way I recall them. It is again that illusion of the transporter beam allowing me to somehow drop in on that moment. But not the flavour or the scent. \n\nAnd recently I read an article in the news about an acquaintance I now know. It turns out he worked in a store over a decade ago and long before we were introduced. But the article had a photo of him from that era. I instantly realized I remembered him. I remember him helping us and selling us the items we went there to buy. And the image in the news article on my screen very much corresponds to the transporter-beam image in my head.

That part seems like embelishment.\n\nThis means if you are not careful, you can remember constructed memories as if they are memories you can really remember.

            "There is no one correct answer. For general pointers, the following are going to be very difficult:\n\n1. Supply chain attack, replacing known good binary with compromised binary. Since the change happens through correct channel (repository/package manager etc.), the \"initial compromise\" phase does not get detected. Later stages may or may not be possible to detect depending upon which package is changed, and the nature of backdoor.\n2. Attacks which compromise the kernel. In some cases, this can be easy to identify (e.g. if this requires some very specific set and/or order of system calls; or requires some reasonably specific parameters etc.). In other cases, it may be very difficult (specially if it uses very common syscall(s), in rather usual order etc.) to detect it early enough. Once kernel is compromised, nothing above it can be trusted.\n3. Network level attacks which compromise kernel directly (e.g. remotely exploitable bug in networking stack). The only hope is to detect it at network level. On host level, there may be nothing useful to notice.\n\nApart from these, attacks using kernel/middleware rootkits etc also tend to be more difficult to detect than other attacks.\n\nRun of the mill attacks which are seen in wild? Most of them can be detected on initial compromise itself. And almost all of them can be flagged at multiple stages (defence evasion, persistence, privilege escalation, data leakage etc.), assuming host has sufficient memory and CPU.",

With victims in large enough numbers, a threat actor is bound to get a lot of juicy data, and a lot of money directly or indirectly.\n\nSemi-targeted attacks are much less frequent, but are not very rare either. These may target some company, group of companies, users of some company, companies in some specific market/sector (energy, communication etc.).\n\nTargeted attacks, and state-sponsored attacks tend to be discrete in nature; and as a result remain under the radar for longest time (in relative to first two categories). These are going to be very small chunk of all the malware stuff happening across the globe.\n\nI cannot comment on exact percentages.",

Yes, I have my own mini malware analysis environment. It is a small contraption of various scripts and tools I wrote, with some off the shelf software. Gets a lot of boring manual work done. Rest of the stuff is done manually. I use this only when I want to study some particular malware which happens to have some interesting technique.\n\nFor professional work, analysis part is taken care of by another team.\n\n3. I develop POC for attacks, as well as POC for detection logic. These are around capturing required telemetry, and having some analytics on top of that to show some detection (std::cout << \"Suspicious technique XXXXX detected\" << std::endl;)\n\n4. Both have their own use cases. For maximum coverage, use both of them.\n\n5. I do not host anything in home network, all that is done on VPS instances.

            "Although exact specifics depend upon your threat model, you can follow some general advices:\n\n1. Stick to packages from known good repositories. Adding random repositories for one-off packages may not be a good idea, unless that is being maintained by some reputed entity (community/forum/company/person etc.)\n2. Keep packages reasonably updated.\n3. As far as possible, keep different services/processes with long life limited to separate users. Those users should have access to only those paths which are needed to run that service/process.\n4. Implement MAC. SELinux, AppArmor etc can be used here depending upon distribution.\n5. Disable remote password authentication. Stick to SSH keys. Disable remote root login as well.\n6. Enable sudo only for specific users, instead of granting access to that to everyone. Even better, configure sudo only for specific commands.\n7. To keep an eye on whatever is happening, configure audit, and monitor those logs to see if something funny is happening. Similarly, you can monitor service-specific logs as well (web server, databases etc.)\n\nThis much should be enough to take you a long way.\n\nFor your final question, again you do not strictly need an anti-virus (or something similar) on Linux machines. However, for certain use cases (or maybe compliance requirements), you may need something which can keep you reasonably safe from shady things. If you want something FOSS, have a look at ClamAV.",

For example, if you bind docker on TCP socket, and expose it to internet without any safeguards, bad things will happen very quickly. But then docker does not enable that configuration by default; and expects you to put sane configuration.\n3. When a malware is simply using an existing intentional functionality, you cannot really block these from OS (i.e. that cannot be baked within OS), as it will eventually block some legitimate activity for some other group of users. However, most OS provide various options to limit what is allowed/disallowed to happen (via users, groups, permissions, access control lists, MAC etc.). For more specialised detection and prevention, one should be using some endpoint protection program.\n\n----\n\nCan you please share some examples of issues that you reported?",

As an example, some individuals are using AI models for writing code or testing it, and it seems to me that that might open the floodgates for a lot of script kiddies to pump out a lot of malware with less of a skill ceiling, quantity over quality. No idea if this would be feasible or effective, but it does seem like if AI will effect defense, it would effect offense in a similar way.\n\nThe integration of AI infrastructure into major operating systems so quickly is something of a concern in my mind and I hold some level of concern over malicious uses of it (from individuals and corporations).",

            "Off the shelf tools like osquery, sysdig etc. My automation is mostly around managing VMs, monitoring certain usermode APIs, monitoring some process memory stuff, parsing and storing it into DB. Analytics part runs on top of DB to find patterns (file I/O by path, by inode+device ID, by alternate paths, process activity, socket I/O, authentications etc.).\n\nCode to monitor things is written in C++. Analytics part is written in C++. \"Glue code\" (the stuff which puts everything together in an ad-hoc pipeline) is basically a collection of shellscripts.\n\nNo, I do not post writeups. I present in security events, but that is limited to offensive side. I do not present defensive side, as that would require various approvals from current and past employers. Probably I can get that, but then I do not want to get into that hassle.\n\nThe POCs are written as part of my full time job; and therefore are passed to other teams for further refinement and integration in existing products. These POCs mostly show the detection part. Input the telemetry data, and it will flag the intended attack pattern (for which POC was written). Sometimes POCs will be around capturing telemetry as well, or enriching existing telemetry, or tying individual telemetry records together etc.\n\nI have hosted a VPN server (OpenVPN), then wireguard when it was new toy. As of now, I have a K8s cluster (mostly used as a playground), a dev+build VPS where I am trying to write some simulators. At some point I also used to host own Jitsi instance. All these have been on VPS instances, and not in home network. Home network does not host anything.\n\nThe \"malware research\" part revolves around two things mostly:\n\n1. Can I evade from $product? If yes, the minimal POC for evasion. Then POC for correct detection (telemetry + analytics).\n2. Did $product miss detection of some malware sample, or detected some steps but missed others? Time to take a look at that sample, see what it did, and where did the detection go wrong. Then fix the detection (or get it fixed).\n\nEverything I do eventually boils down to the above two points.\n\nYes, bulk of malware threat landscape targets Windows. I focus on Linux side of things. Things like attacks targeting containers, Kubernetes, cloud etc. Stuff like container breakout, complete cluster compromise (with multiple nodes); or compromise of Linux hosts (web services, databases, cache services etc.).\n\nMost of the malware will have everything linked statically, while targeting slightly older glibc versions. This allows them to target a wide array of distributions and versions. Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL tend to be most common targets.",
            "I generally recommend to configure it properly, even if it is a PITA to do so. Once it is configured, it will prevent a lot of malicious stuff dead in tracks, simply because MAC policies are set to allow only specific stuff. You became root? Does not matter. MAC still blocks you.\n\nAgain, MAC is not a silver bullet, it is just another layer of defence.",

Other signs of low testosterone in adult men include low energy, low mood, difficulty concentrating, weight gain, difficulty attaining muscle or drop in muscle bulk, reduced facial/body hair.

Most of our cases are under seal and confidential from the public record, but some are in the litigation stage, including a case involving two pharmaceutical companies allegedly falsifying their testing standards to release a bad product.\n\nI\u2019ve predicted that some of the post-2019 programs will be sluggish initially but will eventually gain traction. Interestingly, these programs tend to recoup significant amounts for taxpayers, effectively paying for themselves many times over. There\u2019s a brand-new DOJ corporate criminal corruption program that is expected to be implemented by year\u2019s end, which may bear fruit a few years down the road. Additionally, the revamped Anti-Money Laundering whistleblower program is overdue for some major settlements, particularly when involving sanctioned entities or large financial institutions deliberately skirting KYC requirements. While these programs may remain behind the False Claims Act (FCA) in terms of the quantity of filings, they might occasionally surpass the FCA in the amount recovered, especially with very large one-off cases.\n\nOur firm is apolitical, and both sides of Congress generally champion the False Claims Act and statutes that hold bad actors accountable. Former President Trump already served four years, and during that time, there was nothing perceived from the administration that undermined whistleblower statutes.

However, as I often point out, to claim whistleblower protections, the conduct needs to squarely fit within a whistleblower statute, and this appears to fall short. There\u2019s no common law (non-statutory) protection for whistleblowers per se. \n\n# Traitor/Spy Perspective:\n\n* **National Security Risks:**\u00a0Critics argue that Snowden's disclosures compromised national security, undermining intelligence operations and putting personnel at risk. As a former FBI Special Agent who ran and participated in undercover activities, this could have deep concerns. \n* **Unauthorized Disclosure:**\u00a0By leaking classified information, Snowden violated the Espionage Act, leading some to label him a traitor who endangered national security for personal motives. \n\nThe debate over Snowden's actions highlights the challenges we face with emerging technology eviscerating our privacy.

            "Oh. My. God!\n\n\nI'll try to keep this general and not specific to my building, as it was retrofitted and has its own unique problems.\n\n\nThe floors need to be bleachable. Having a room designated for decedents in advanced stages of decomposition is helpful, but maggots can crawl very fast and squeeze into any nook and cranny. They like drains and anything that provides shade, so if you have a way to prevent them from crawling up the wall and hiding in our stations, that'd be awesome.\n\n\nIn-floor grinders, walls that can be written on with dry-erase markers, and storage that is somewhere between the autopsy bay and wherever supplies enter the building at. If it's not a long walk, just keep it near the autopsy bay.\u00a0\n\n\nIn metropolitan areas with lots of people coming through the morgue, storage in the cooler is a must. A large, separate cooler for \"long timers\" (decedents with no family, unidentified remains, etc.) that can double as separate storage for decomposed remains so the main cooler doesn't smell when the door is opened.\n\n\nGiving the techs big desks is also appreciated, sometimes we have a tonne of evidence, histology,\u00a0or tox to go through, and having small desks makes it difficult to do the work. We all like each other in the office, so we don't want super separate spaces. We share one big room, with our boss's office being a separate room inside of our big room.\n\n\nMaking sure that the viewing bay for non-staff is SEPARATE from the viewing bay for the techs is also huge. I hate sharing my office space with people that are present for any given autopsy, they always make comments on our decorations, sit in our chairs, or set their stuff down on our desks.\n\n\nOh, and one last thing, please make sure there's a bathroom nearby with a shower. I don't care if there's another bathroom for the investigators, having to walk all the way up front covered in unspeakable amount of human goo sucks for everybody.\n\n\nIf you have any other questions or specific ideas, I'd love to help!",
            "Forensic scientist here that just got a new lab built this past year.  Make sure to install drains for the safety showers, these dummies who built it didn't even do that.",
            "As a forensic tech in a crime lab - INDIVIDUALIZED WORKSPACES PLEASE. With LOTS of storage. Like, more storage than you think they could possibly need. WE NEED IT. Individual lockdown exam rooms for examination of larger items. A separate space for reagent storage and prep, plus washing and autoclaving glassware. Having spaces for embedded freezers at each workspace is a must. Having a separate but connected lab room for amplification is also great, but I know smaller labs make do.",
            "I'm sorry to hear that.\n\n\nYes, the smell does stick, I've found anything porous or elastic holds it the worst. Hair, sports bras, and the thermal shirts I wear in the winter REALLY refuse to let it go.\n\n\nI'm more of a baby than most of my coworkers, so while I don't think I will ever be able to \"get used to it\", everybody else seems to do it eventually. I wear the N95 masks we wear during autopsy any time I'm with a decomposed decedent, and am a mouth\u00a0 breather a decent chunk of the time. I've tried the vaporub/essential oil/lotion tricks, and I've found that I eventually become nose-blind to them and I'm right back where I started. I CAN handle it if I'm in another room, but sometimes doing autopsies on them is challenging, even breathing through my mouth.\n\n\nSometimes I worry about running errands after work and having someone else smell the decomp in my hair. I try to avoid going places after work on those days, but if I have to, I keep spare undergarments and perfume for my hair at work to help mitigate it.",
            "I'm sorry to hear about your friend.\n\n\nYes, we definitely do have some \"inconclusive\" autopsies. Unfortunately, some things like arrhythmias leave no physical trace in the body, so it's a matter of proving that nothing else could have happened than it is actually having proof the arrhythmia occurred. However, there's varying degrees of rarity for what 'type' of inconclusive the autopsy is.\n\n\nHow somebody dies is broken up into 2 terms: cause of death and manner of death.\n\n\nCause of death is going to be your specifics. Heart attack, sequelae of metastatic breast cancer, blunt force trauma, etc. Manner of death will be homicide, traffic, accidental, natural, etc. Sometimes decedents will be unknown in one, but not the other. These are more common. Think of skeletal remains showing evidence of homicide, but the exact mechanism behind their death left no evidence in toxicology or their bones. Or, vice versa, someone is found outside with head trauma. Their cause of death might be a subdural hemorrhage, but the manner of death might be unknown because there's no evidence showing whether it was an accident or a homicide.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes decedents fall under both and there really are no answers for us to discover.\u00a0Those tend to be the rarest ones, and I always feel bad reading the DCs and thinking about the loved ones who waited 4-6 weeks for the report only to be met with 'idk bro, srry!'",
            "Same thing with my friend. 54 yrs old. She was one of my best friends. Over thirty years of friendship. Except no autopsy.",
            "Overdoses, hands down. Admittedly, there are a tonne of cases that never even make it to us because the decedent has extensive (documented) medical history or their doctor is willing to sign the DC. So I'm sure there are a lot of heart attacks and cancer deaths that we don't get (though we do get some if the doctor won't sign or if there isn't documentation of their condition(s)).\u00a0\n\n\nBut yeah, the fentanyl crisis is NO JOKE. We're having people of all ages, most of whom are taking some other DOC like meth or cocaine (weed is legal here so we don't see many laced carts) but their tox report shows extremely high levels of fentanyl.\n\n\nAs for this job, I had no idea this job even existed until I saw the job listing! I was initially doing a production line job that had nothing to do with my degree, and I spent nearly 6 months looking for a job to replace it. It was a complete and total happy accident lol!",
            "So at least for my office, all you need is a bachelor's in some type of science-adjacent field. Apparently back in the day you only needed an associate's, but the standards jumped a little over time. Most of us in the back have anth degrees at this point, but biology is another big one. Training is provided on site, and some supervisors actually prefer people who have never eviscerated because they can train them EXACTLY how they want them to do it.\n\n\nThough, eventually everyone goes off and does it their own way.\n\n\nNow, to be a forensic pathologist or a pathology assistant, you WOULD have to attend med school. We get residents and fellows through rotation at the morgue, and the amount of work they have to put in is CRAZY. Can't say I'd personally ever go back to college for the degree to do that, but there IS a nation-wide shortage of forensic pathologists, so if that's your dream job, shoot your shot!",
            "Hahaha, I actually LOVED Bones as a kid. I got my degree in anth because of it, and a lot of my profs in college had met Kathy Reichs personally.\n\n\nAny TV show depicting an autopsy always fails to make the \"decedent\" look dead. No lividity, their eyes and mouth are closed, no emesis or frothy foam, it's just not realistic. The intestines can't fall out like they do in shows/movies, the mesentery keeps them kind of in place.\n\n\nWe DO use garden loppers for opening the chest cavity and oscillating saws to open the skull, but even when those are portrayed correctly (think Dr. G's show), they don't tend to get the PPE correct. You should be wearing a N95 mask while doing an autopsy, especially when opening the skull. Nobody wants TB or meningitis!",
            "Not OP, obviously, just a forensic tech as well, and oh my god, PLEASE, every single one of those shows is AWFUL at properly depicting forensic work. It\u2019s difficult to get into specifics because some of their creative choices are so outrageous, but a few big ones: total lack of scene security or sterility, lack of PPE, instant results from databases, \u201cenhancing\u201d stuff a billion times to find the tiniest inconsistencies, etc. Basically, whenever they\u2019re at a scene or using a computer, expect it to be complete fiction.",
            "What are your thoughts on \u201cI zombie\u201d?",
            "TW: Talk of mental health\n\n\nI've always had kind of a unique relationship with death, I've been fascinated by how different cultures react to it for almost as long as I can remember. I became passively suicidal late in high school, and while I was medicated for recurrent severe MDD (w/o pf) in college, my kinda laissez-faire attitude towards my own death never really left. I had a hard time processing that, because it seems to conflict with how much I really enjoy living.\n\n\nMy job has shown me what NOT to do, I've mentioned motorcycles in other replies and I will continue to mention them because those things are SO dangerous, and what to expect as I'm dying or as loved ones are dying. I really love my job, and there's plenty of stuff to enjoy while I'm alive, but I do see death as the great equalizer. Everyone will die, everyone will decompose, and none of us will look great doing it. I find that kind of comforting, if I'm being honest. There are some ways I hope I DON'T go, but seeing this part of the life cycle day in and day out did help me kinda process my own mental health struggles. I have a profound respect for death as an entity, but existing is pretty cool too.",
            "So my first experience with a dead body was actually in high school my senior year. I didn't work on her, but when I went in for my 2nd interview (they do 2 rounds of interviews, a \"normal\" 1st one and then a 2nd one where you come in and watch an autopsy to make sure you can handle it. This happened through trial and error.) I was thinking it'd be easy-peasy. I'd seen a dead body before, surely it won't bother me if it didn't the first time.\n\n\nNOPE!!\n\n\nMy now boss unzipped the body bag and for a moment I was overcome with this intense wave of fear. I was locked in place for several seconds, not breathing, just staring at the decedent. Retrospectively, he wasn't decomposed or badly injured, but what really got to me was the fact that he had passed away outside. He had fistfuls of grass in his hands and garbage in the bag with him. I would consider that my first true interaction with death, I'll never forget him or his face.\u00a0\n\n\nI actually have a very intense fear of freshly deceased remains sitting up on my table, so it took me a LONG time to feel even remotely comfortable with them. I handled the viscera pretty well, I actually found some moments during it to be reminiscent of famous paintings, but I could not get over the tendons moving things seemingly on their own.\n\n\nI got Dairy Queen on my way home, and really debated on whether or not I'd be able to do the job. But, the longer I thought about it, the more I felt like I COULD do it. I've got a good brain for it, I'm good at processing and compartmentalizing, so I shot my shot and beat out several other candidates.",
            "Small set, 100%. I would say this job would be exceptionally traumatizing for the majority of the population. You're getting extreme levels of gore, with very intense sights, sounds, smells, and textures. Sometimes the decedent is someone you've seen or even know personally. You're going to get cases that remind you of yourself or your loved ones-- I'm not sure how the doctors handle being parents while working on cases with children the same age as their own. I know I would have a hard time coming back from maternity leave and then doing an autopsy on a 3mo who died of positional asphyxia.\n\n\nHaving a dark sense of humour is equally important. Grim reaper tattoos on decedents is something I see all the time, but it never ceases to get at least a smile out of me.\u00a0\n\n\nCompartmentalizing is your friend, and you can't take anything too seriously or it'll kill you over time-- but also, ignoring what you see completely isn't good either. It's a great way to really learn about what NOT to do. I will never, EVER get onto a motorcycle or split a 'percocet' with friends because of this job.",
            "As a forensic tech in a crime lab myself, I can definitely second that it takes a very specific subset of people to thrive in these environments, and that subset of people is very\u2026interesting. \n\nMy coworkers and I span the entire range of ages and personalities do vary, but I would say the defining trait for us all is that we\u2019re just\u2026odd. A bit weird, from an outsider looking in. Rarely neurotypical, in most senses. Without context, people would probably consider us mechanical, or callous. The overwhelming backlog of cases and the wealth of terrible information we\u2019re bombarded with every single day would kill a \u201cnormal\u201d person, I\u2019m almost certain. The mental weight that every single case, every single piece of evidence has a real victimized person behind it is overwhelming at the best of times. You need to be the type of person who is kind and attentive to detail, but also the type of person to completely disconnect emotionally and joke about the tragedy, or you\u2019d go insane. My coworkers are all extremely friendly and sociable, especially outside of work, but in the lab with our evidence, it truly becomes little more than a numbers game, a step-by-step process you\u2019ve done a thousand times before. It has to.  \n\nThere was a girl who worked at my lab before I ever started, and she was a deeply emotional person. By all accounts, extremely sweet and very good at her job. But her emotional attachment to every single case caused her to overwork herself to no end. The way she processed evidence and especially SA kits was extremely in-depth, beyond even the point of due diligence or case circumstance, and she never left a single spot or swab untested, and when tests invariably came up negative anyway (as many do, unfortunately), she took it extremely hard. She felt as though she HAD to find SOMETHING, and not doing so was a failure. She didn\u2019t last very long.",

It's historically been very easy to get overtime, but that'll probably change once the new employees are fully trained and we're not running on fumes anymore.\n\n\nNot bad pay, but if my roommate were to disappear tomorrow I would not be able to pay the rent for our shared apt by myself, I'd have to downsize.",

We got some new employees, so once they're trained, we'll switch to a different schedule where multiple techs are on for the weekend. Which is great, because our average daily caseload is 5-8 bodies and it's simply too much for 1 tech to handle most of the time.\n\n\nWe in the back don't HAVE to go out to scenes, but we COULD if it wasn't busy and we wanted to. I haven't gone yet, but I've been wanting to for a few months now. Death Investigators (DIs) will go out to scene, photograph the scene, photograph the body, speak to the family, and come back. A 3rd party transport crew will bag the remains and bring them to our office. Once we're done and the family has selected a funeral home, the funeral home will come and collect the bodies from us. Our office does cover a decent amount of land, so sometimes the DIs have to drive an hour or two to get to the scene.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's why they get the company cars that drive correctly, and we get the ones with broken power steering lol!",
            "The rarest natural cause was the amniotic fluid embolism, by far. The mother's (decedent's) lungs were filled with amniotic fluid and meconium that passed through the placenta, traveled through her circulatory system, and ended up in her lungs. She essentially drowned in the fluid from her uterus.\n\n\nThe rarest non-natural cause... We had an individual who intentionally laid down on train tracks and let the train bisect him. I wasn't present that day, but I did get to see the x-ray.\n\n\nNot to be morbid, but if your cause of death does wind up being some type of blood clot, it'll definitely wind up on your DC, and the doctors will probably call each other in to look at the histological evidence.",

It took a while for us to figure out if she was deceased before or after, and it was determined that she was unconscious but definitely still alive.\n\n\nLess specifically, I've gotten several men in full-blown AIDS. Skinny as a rail, kaposi sarcoma, etc., they literally look like they just stepped foot out of the 1980s.

For example, doing a layered neck, where we peel back each individual muscle group in the neck to look for trauma.

It's more acceptable if you go too far down on the non-presenting side, but you should try to avoid it. The ear canal issue comes when reflecting the scalp back over the forehead, sometimes there's a lot of tension behind the ears and it prevents you from pulling it down over the head, so you have to take a scalpel to the area and release it. You just have to be REALLY careful while doing it.\n\n\nI actually have a question in turn for you, dear embalmer from Saskatchewan: how big of a deal is it if we cut the femoral arteries when taking the bladder, reproductive organs, and colon?

Outside of those, the cases we don't do tend to have fairly obvious cause of deaths. Ie. Someone with untreated diabetes and multiple lower-limb amputations, or someone with end stage alcoholism who is so jaundiced the vitreous in their eyes is yellow.\n\n\nObviously the family is welcome to pay for an additional private autopsy to be done, and maybe the forensic pathologist they see might be willing to change the MANNER on the DC, but that's beyond our office at that point. I think I only know of one instance of a doctor abiding by the family wishes and leaving information off of the DC, and they're NOT one of the staff dr.s at my office.

            "Hi, not OP, but work in death investigation. OP could probably provide a more fulsome answer, as I do not work directly with the forensic pathology staff, nor in cases as described.\n\nI cannot answer your first question. Regarding #2, the known circumstances of the person's history prior to death would be a part of information gathering. Many types of substance abuse (and the sudden nature of an overdose) would likely leave evidence of some kind at the scene. Also how the person is found (where, their position, etc) could clue investigators to look further, or that something was not quite right. Should evidence of drugs/paraphernalia be missed on investigation, or cleaned up prior to first responders arriving, that could pose an issue. \n\nHowever for a person with no known co-morbidities and a sudden death, a toxicology panel would be ordered to rule out the possibility of an acute intoxication. Advanced decomposition may be a factor for whatever samples are available if there is a delay between death and discovery, but the liver may still be viable for sampling versus fluids (blood, urine, vitreous fluids). \n\nIn an alternate scenario, a person could have a death as described when in the company of others, or witnessed/in public. And so in those cases, the person would have likely been taken to a hospital. The hospital would take blood samples, which could be retrieved.\n\nA person may also have a known substance use disorder (whether past or current) and multiple known co-morbidities, which can also present its own series of processes of elimination re whether it was a disease process or toxicity if drugs were found in their system at the time of their death. e.g. a person's individual level of tolerance of a drug would impact what the lethal limit would be for them versus, say, an opioid-naive person.",

Oftentimes when they are included in these reports they're fairly extensive, with some correlating to medical records of prior attempts.

My understanding is that the decedent did not die immediately, and that case especially shook me because my cousin drank battery acid as a child and had to have his stomach pumped. In a metaphorical sense, it could have been him on the table in front of me, y'know?\u00a0Occasionally decedents' stories will mirror stories in my own life, and it's always a little uncanny.\n3. To put it very simply, I have the brain for it. I'm naturally talented at compartmentalization, and processing what I'm seeing. Child abuse cases, violent murders, aforementioned cases that just hit you a little differently than others, all of those are things that I cannot get hung up on and also do my job effectively. I have to hang those feelings up and approach them again later-- I've found that talking about them helps a lot with taking them off of the coat hook. Within reason, of course, I can't share intimate details about a lot of those cases, but I'm generally allowed to share the basic information that any news organization would have. (Which is unfortunate, because the news gets a TONNE wrong, especially early on!)\n4. This applies to forensics in its entirety, but the public is greatly misinformed about what we can and cannot do. We're viewed as both over AND under capable. Forensics isn't magic, but it also has come a long way and can be VERY impressive. A bit more specifically with relation to my job.. a lot of people seem to thing we work directly with police officers for some reason. We don't, at least not in the back! Occasionally one will sit in for an autopsy, or one will be the subject of an autopsy and there will be a procession for them, but outside of those 2 circumstances, I've never interacted with an officer while on the clock.\n5. Unfortunately, my cultural anth background doesn't come up very often aside from acknowledging the decedent's religion and any restrictions that come with them, such as Muslims or Orthodox Jews. I think a lot of that stems from the lack of living people that I interact with on a daily basis. We don't tend to get a lot of background information regarding any given culture the decedent came from, so if it's not immediately identifiable like skin colour or a cross necklace, I have no way of knowing about it. I try to be extra careful with the hair of Black and Indigenous decedents, but that's sadly as much as much as my degree gets used for at work. On a whole I think it makes me more compassionate/understanding via cultural relativism, but that only impacts my internal self and not so much the work I conduct, if that makes any sense!",
            "Honestly, if you're genuinely concerned about your body decomposing after death, get into the habit of messaging someone every day! The remains we received that are in a state of decomposition are generally the result of individuals who don't have anybody keeping an eye out for them. Nobody keeps their beauty while decomposing, but if you'd rather nobody sees you in that state (which, while I understand, none of us death workers are judgemental about it-- we all understand the natural order of things), making sure that SOMEONE will notice your absence is the #1 way ensure that.",

            "This is all wonderful firsthand information, so thank you for sharing.  \n\nI was unaware of the extent of the maggot issue, so that's good to know. We always include a separate decomp area with their own amenities as much as possible, but I'll look into the separation of those spaces in more detail.  \n\nStorage is always an issue, but like highway lanes, it will always be full no matter how much there is, lol. Distributed storage in addition to central storage is always a good starting point.  \n\nCoolers are a tough one, and usually one where the ME has a strong opinion. Ideally, there would be more than enough space and separation, though I had not considered storage of anything but descedents in there.  \n\nI wish everyone could have a generous space to work, though this is often up the the managers and deals with systems furniture unless it is a specialized analysis like firearms or ALS. A 5' desk (if not an \"L\") is the minimum IMO.  \n\nAre you talking about the viewing bay into the autopsy suite? I hadn't heard of that requested separation before, but space-permitting that seems like a prudent idea.  \n\nRegarding a restroom/shower nearby the autopsy suite, I absolutely agree. I think it's a failure of design forethought (or perhaps an unfortunate consequence of adaptive reuse) to locate the only showers down the hall. Not only gross, but also hazardous.  \n\nThank you again for your insight!",
            "Interestingly, you've stumbled upon a hot button issue in laboratory design. There are different established schools of thought about whether or not to put a floor drain below a safety shower. The safety showers are not used with tremendous frequency, and in fact most of their service life is spent doing monthly tests. For those monthly tests a simple bucket can be used to catch water and ensure they are working. In an actual spill event, what would be flushed down a floor drain would be considered unneutralized chemicals, and all that water would need to be retained for acid neutralization. Some facilities have large, centralized acid neutralization infrastructure that can accommodate floor drain waste, but this is a larger expenditure. Many facilities, including possibly yours, are of the opinion that a clean up job after the rare shower usage event is worth the savings from omitting the floor drains.",

There\u2019ll be a notecard listing each cadaver\u2019s name, age, occupation, and maybe a few other personal details, but in general their faces are covered and they\u2019re just referred to as \u201ccadavers.\u201d\n\nForensic gore isn\u2019t the same at all, at least to me personally.

A doctor needs a photo, they can come up to the window and mime a camera, or if someone rolls a body too far and gets trapped under them, someone can see that they're in trouble. This MIGHT be an us-specific thing, but we will frequently go back to our desks to upload BEs/photos while other people are in the autopsy bay.",
            "A question for you if I may. How does a place like the ones you are designing get rid of the smell/gases? I'm assuming there would be plenty of exhaust fans, but do they just blow out onto the street or is the air treated in some way as to not blow pure death air out to the public?",

I didn't have any type of guidance like this, and a lot of the old-school anthropology mentors I had had a very rigid and narrow view of what an anthropologist can look like. I know a lot of people relate to having passion, but not knowing where to direct it because nobody is willing to take the time to show them the paths.",
            "I totally understand. Safety is paramount, which is why I like to include interior windows in labs. I have see this fixed operationally by requiring that autopsy work have two people in the room. Perhaps it's an opportunity for a technology solution.",
            "Since those odors are really just a nuisance but not a hazard, they are exhausted through the main HVAC system. That air usually exhausts through some fan on the roof. It's all a matter of concentration, so by the time that that air would reach any human nose, it would be so diluted that it is not perceptible. Exhaust from fume hoods on the other hand (which likely contain hazardous chemicals) must be exhausted through powerful blowers on the roof which accelerate the exhausting gas to high velocities directly upwards so that it gets taken away in the upper air currents instead of finding its way down to street level. Again, dilution is the key in that strategy as well."

            "Hi, I've texted this line before a few times in my life and I've had VERY bad experiences. I've always felt infantilized. I know I'm also not alone in my experience with this as there are a few threads on here that corroborate my experience. \n\nWhoever we've spoken to seemed poorly trained or someone who didn't take us seriously. They recommended very simple things like \"taking a warm bath\" or \"have a nice cup of tea\" when people have texted them describing extremely serious, traumatic and devastating circumstances. They did not seem ready to deal with people like us AT ALL. \n\nThey also, rather infuriatingly, seem to parrot back exactly what we say to them over and over. Say someone tells them \"I feel terrible because my family is really abusive, I'm broke, I'm homeless, etc,\" they will respond with \"I'm hearing that you feel terrible because of your family and home situation.\" Like... yes, that's exactly what I just said. Now what?\n\nCan you please explain why this may have happened, and is this a common experience? \n\nWhat is the \"standard\" to which they are held, and what are they *supposed* to say/do? \n\nIs the \"parroting back\" actually supposed to help, like has anyone actually found any comfort from having their words just being repeated back to them over and over? \n\nAnd what would you recommend to a person who has had a similar experience to ours?",

I\u2019ve lived with mental illness for most of my life and have utilized the line a few times during my worst moments, and having someone there was indescribably helpful. \n\nCrisis can be a vague term - I always took it to mean acutely suicidal, but I\u2019ve always wondered.

I imagine I\u2019m definitely not the only one who does it but it must be discouraging and well, difficult on your end. \n\nI\u2019ve lived though so much hard stuff and have come through so much of it that I think I\u2019d be great as a crisis counsellor, but I\u2019m afraid that someone might hurt themselves while on the line with me and that scares me.

            "Why do you keep reposting this?",
            "Hi there,  \n  \nSo when we go through our training we are taught quite a bit about self-care. When starting off it can be hard to practice those self-care methods, because it's new and usually it takes a bit of time for the job to wear on you, at least in my case. After some time, I started feeling the burnout and the need to step away and take care of myself.   \n  \nFrom then on, it has been much easier and natural to separate my work from my personal life. The best way to give care is to know you are in the right mind space to do it. So I now feel the need to make sure that separation is there, because I know if it is not, my work will decline. \n\nNo real special techniques just remembering what gives you joy and making sure you make time for those things during your week. :)",
            "Hi there, \n\nMy apologies first off for the late response. I also want to personally apologize to you and to anyone else who has ever had an experience like this with Crisis Text Line. Even as a Crisis Counselor, I can even agree with you that some of the training we utilize is not that good for all texters. I am gonna try and answer everything you asked, it's gonna be long!  \n\nI saw you say \"parroting back\" which is referred to as validating or mirroring in our training. We are told it is supposed to show that we are really listening to you, I do think it helps some texters but I definitely see why it may not help others. Regardless there should be a pattern with it, that not all counselors get on. For instance, after mirroring something a texter said to us, we should ask a question along with it to make the conversation flow.\n\nExample: \n\nTexter: I got a bad grade on a test today, and I am just really stressed out. \n\nVolunteer: I hear you got a bad grade on a test today, it would make sense to be stressed out over something like this. Maybe you could share more about how it is making you feel? I want to support you through this. \n\nSome people really do like this method, because it does show you are listening to the texter, but some counselors over use it. We should not have every message we send have an \"I hear that...\" or \"I can see you..\". \n\nNow, about what we recommend and things like when we say \"coping skills\", it is important to mention a counselor is never able to give true advice, we are never allowed to give our opinions on the situation you are facing. A lot of people get upset by this, and the skills we offer just don't work.\n\nWith that being said, we always to first ask about things you have done in the past for stress before we recommend anything. When then will try to give you a list of things to choose from. I know many know this list, \"75 coping ideas when yours aren't working anymore\" if we can't get something from that we are supposed to work with you to find a coping skill. \n\nThe counselor you describe I can tell was not putting in any effort to ask you more questions about things you enjoy or about what makes you happy. I am sorry you had an experiences like that again, I will tell you there are a lot of good counselors who will sit with you and try to come up with some real coping skills. I can tell you had a counselor who was not trying though and I am sorry for that. \n\nAbout them not being ready to take on your trauma, our training covers a very wide scope of things and in my personal opinion is not the best place to talk about sexual assaults. I like to say we are trained like PCP doctors we have a scope of a little bit of everything but we are not experts. With that, many counselors will not be ready to take a call like a sexual assault because our training does not go in-depth enough. (I picked sexual assault as an example because I very much agree with you on topics like this). \n\nAnyone who experiences a sexual assault and needs someone to talk to, I highly recommend you reach out to [RAINN](http://rainn.org). \n\nI want to say again I am truly sorry for the experience you had as someone who is devoting their life to crisis work, I can tell you we never want people to feel infantilized. We want to give you space to be able to vent and move from a hot moment to a cool moment. The experience you went through is something I will address to my coach and to our supervisors because I want to make sure that I am able to provide the best support when texters like you and others who have had similar experiences come to me on our line.",
            "I had the same experience. Took all I had to text in and felt worse after it was over.",
            "Hey there, \n\nI first want to say, that I am so happy that you have used the hotline in some of your worst moments, being there for people when they need us most and then seeing how it helps, is why I do this. Living with mental illness is very difficult and being able to ask for help and knowing it is there can make all the difference. \n\nCrisis is a vague term, but like you said it does not just mean suicide. In fact, most people who reach out in crisis aren't suicidal. The most common issues we deal with are people struggling with Anxiety/Stress, Relationships, and Depression/Sadness. Suicide is our 4th biggest category, but what can an appropriate reason to reach out be? Truthfully, there is no answer, I like to tell people that everyone is different, and will feel that urge to talk to someone at different points. But if you feel like you have no one to talk to and your thoughts are racing, text in. There does not need to be a specific thing that happens that day, if you just need to chat about your feelings, we are here. \n\nI hope that answers your question! :)",
            "We definitely do! Chitchat I would say we see a lot less of, but we always start with asking if they have had any suicidal thoughts today, or in the past few days, and then asking if they have taken any action to harm themselves today. So if both those questions get a no response and the person begins chitchatting with no real crisis present, we will try to inform them about what we do at the hotline, and how we work. We try to be as caring as possible and let them know if they don't have a crisis we can't really help them. \n\nA lot of people will start a conversation by saying I am not in a crisis, but we always still take these convos and risk assessments, it is common for people to share more info as the questions start coming, and from that, we can see how to best help.",
            "We do get some prank texters, but not as many as you may think. Out of all the texters I have helped I can only think of maybe one or two pranks. These convos don't last long though, usually when you try to engage with prank texters they stop responding, or will end the chat. \n\nThere have been some weird ones that can be pranks for sexual gratification, and yeah those are a bit memorable as they are very uncomfortable.",
            "Hey there,\n\nI appreciate your kind words. They really mean a lot to me, knowing that people really do appreciate the work that crisis line workers do, and seeing the results is why I do all this. \n\nIn regards to your question, I can definitely see why you might not want to make the counselor feel \u201cdown\u201d. I will say don\u2019t let that ever stop you from texting in, when you\u2019re in those down moments, knowing that just by having a simple conversation and by listening, we can help. It Definitely makes that \u201cdown\u201d feeling for me at least go away or not be there in the first place. \n\nWe hear it all, from suicide to sexual abuse, so how do I feel when people come to me? In truthfulness, I feel exhilarated, I get a rush, knowing that there\u2019s a chance I can help save this person. That rush and knowing you saved, someone is such an amazing feeling that trump\u2019s over all my other feelings and everything else in my life life in that moment.\n\nIt\u2019s such a rewarding job, and I can\u2019t really put it into words, but just knowing you\u2019re helping and saving people just makes everything else melt away at least for me.",
            "Hey there,\n\nAbsolutely, OCD is definitely a harder thing to treat on a crisis line because we cannot give any actual therapeutic advice. In our training, the stages we go through, are very similar to how OCD person will feel. Starting from having an initial thought, having said, thought run your mind, then looking for temporary relief, then the cycle starts again. \n\nThe big issue with OCD is the temporary relief is what it is temporary. It\u2019s very hard sometimes to have people who are struggling with severe OCD identify next steps as most of them are aware if it\u2019s not this one thought they\u2019re going to keep having or action it will be another.\n\nOne of the most renowned and scientifically studied ways of treating OCD is with CBT. Trying to break that thought loop/actions is extremely difficult and it is the reason why when we have OCD texters we always do our best to refer them out, to a therapist or psychologist.",
            "We do get a large number of what are called STOP texts. Many of these texters are midway in the Convo, it can be a little discouraging, especially when the STOP happens when you feel like you\u2019re really working with the Texter.\n\nBut responses like yours give us reassurance that some people may have gotten everything they need out of everything we talked about. \n\nAnd I\u2019m really happy to see your interest in being a crisis counselor! The training is 30 hours and it covers a variety of topics self harm is included. I will tell you that it is very intense and you will have texters who are actively harming themselves while you chat. It can be really scary, but we always remember that the texter is in control. We encourage them to stop harming themselves while we keep chatting, and some don\u2019t and that\u2019s OK. We will ask them to let us know if they start to develop any severe symptoms while they\u2019re harming like severe bleeding, etc.\n\nIt is an amazing and extremely rewarding Volunteer experience. I\u2019ll drop a link to a FAQ for being a crisis counselor, you need to scroll a bit down to see the volunteer questions. \n\n[Crisis Text Line FAQ](https://www.crisistextline.org/about-us/faq/)",
            "Hi there, \n\nSo Crisis Text Line has a new safety assessment that is the first assessment model to be accredited by the American Association of Suicidology. This new model has many amazing techniques to differentiate texters who have a plan and who are just having thoughts of suicide.   \n  \nThis begins when you first text in and begin chatting with your crisis counselor, within the first 5-10 minutes you will be asked two questions regardless of what you texted in about. Have you had any thoughts of suicide today, or in the past few days? And Have you taken any action to harm yourself today?  \n  \nIf either of these questions get a yes response, a full safety assessment is needed and this will explore a bit more about their crisis and ask questions along the way. These questions are what makes us know if a texter has a plan, or is having thoughts. We do this simply by asking, Are you thinking of acting on these suicidal thoughts? We then ask to see if they have a plan, means, time frame, and predatory behaviors (such as writing a suicide note).  If those 4 questions of thoughts, plan, means, and timeframe have yes answers this is a texter that after assessing we needed them to make a safety plan with us, or a ESI (Emergency Service Intervention) will be needed to make sure they are safe. \n\nAlmost always people will agree to create a safety plan, and will sit with us and we will think of triggers that lead to the thoughts. Then trying to find ways for the texter to cope, which is done by brainstorming and by some resources we give. Most high-risk calls like this don't want to kill themselves, they text in because deep down some part of them wants to live.",
            "No, since we are completely text based, we would never be able to get a person hospitalized. If we sent resources like Police or EMS to someone they have the power to initiate a hospitalization of the texter.",
            "So I am located in PA, and interestingly Crisis Text Line actually also accepts 988 chats and texts when there is overflow across the country. For almost all work answering 988 phone calls in PA, you need to have a bachelors with 2-3 years experience in crisis work, or a masters, an LPC or a LCSW license is usually not required to take calls. \n\nI am hoping after I have some more volunteer experience or after I finish my masters I will be able to take 988 calls here. The work you do in the mobile crisis unit is amazing also, the need for a mobile crisis response is so huge. Hopefully one day we will be able to have your profession in all cities across the US to response to mental health emergency\u2019s.",
            "Hi there, \n\nSo all schools are different, many will count CTL as field or clinical experience (assuming you are a psych major) however you will most likely need to get this approved by the PSY coordinator of field experience, before starting just to make sure your volunteer work can be counted as credit. \n\nGetting your verification is easy, when you log onto the homepage of the platform to take calls there is a spot where you can request a verification and it will download a PDF just like mine in my initial post.  \n  \nYou can download your verification at any point while being a crisis counselor, and it will update with the number of calls and hours you have devoted each time you download it. \n\nHope this helps!",
            "Always happy to see a fellow counselor! So we are never encouraged anymore to take more than 2 calls at a time. In fact we are really discouraged now from taking more than 1 call, we had a new safety update, called the SAM model which replaced the LURA, and this new model is amazing and takes some time to get used to. \n\nThere was a ton of issues with CTL in the early 2020s, from Nacy Lubin the founder of CTL, and the quality of the counseling the texter was seeing. These have all been addressed and we currently have a policy in place because of this new model that no counselor should take more than 2 calls max (This will change when the new model has been around for a bit). \n\nOn that, the numbers are very high, last night I saw the peak last night at about 325 texters in the queue.  \n\nI have been seeing a lot of stress and anxiety due to work and financial issues at the moment, it has been a very common trend recently.",
            "Hey there, \n\nI will answer your questions in reverse. So the average conversation can last anywhere from about 30 minutes to an hour and 45 minutes. All conversations are different though and can be shorter or longer. \n\nWho responds to the ESI, can be police, EMS, or a crisis intervention team. It is all dependent on the situation the texter is facing. As well as where the texter is located, with that most areas do not have mobile crisis intervention teams, but many cities are expanding! \n\nFor your first question, if we had a texter who was self-harming without the intention to die, an ESI would not be activated at all unless the texter has expressed they are feeling serious medical symptoms due to the self-harm or they request it. This also goes to say with the exact example you gave of a texter harming only for self-harm, with no intention of dying, they would not need to have a safety plan to be created. It will definitely be heavily encouraged, but if this hypothetical texter hit STOP without a plan an ESI would not be needed. Unless again they express serious medical symptoms. \n\nWe have very specific criteria for an ESI because we see it as a last resort. We never want to initiate one unless we have exhausted all other options. \n\nWe are always here to help, at just a text away to 741-741.",
            "No, no one has ever taken their life while speaking to me. I have had a few texters text in when they were in an active attempt such as a gun in hand or about to jump from a ledge. And I\u2019m happy to say all of them I was able to de-escalate the situation, using strength, IDs and good contact techniques, and all were able to create a safety plan keeping them safe for that night. Some of these calls are my proudest moments as a crisis worker.",
            "I have always been very interested in psychology, as it is where my education is. I always wanted to help in a really meaningful way ever since I was in high school. I knew I didn\u2019t want to be in a desk job or anything like that.\n\nWhile exploring job opportunities, I found Crisis Text Line for a volunteer opportunity. I just fell in love with it from there.\n\nI truthfully thought I wanted to be a developmental psychologist studying child development. But I fell in love with crisis work. Being able to help people in their darkest moments is what I plan on doing for my career indefinitely.",
            "I have definitely! I am hoping within this year I will be able to make a transition over to phone calls. And yes, I was looking for some volunteer options at the time no real interest in crisis work, but once I started in the texts I loved it. \n\nI personally have not needed services like this and I am grateful for that, I know that if I ever did there is a place to turn to. \n\nI think that living through these experiences can defiantly help someone with the experience as a crisis counselor. I would not say it makes someone necessarily better, everyone undergoes the same training, and I have seen some great and not-so-great counselors (none of which I know their personal experiences).",
            "Hey there,\n\nI was actually going to include this in the post probably should have, yeah this is like my third time posting. IAmA moderators were not happy with the proof I was giving. \n\nfortunately, the proof I have is all good so this will be the last post and the only one.",
            "This post is helpful. Dbad.",
            "Thank you!",
            "Thank you, I may try to swing back in when I can get more time to my schedule, I miss it. Will have to do some retraining with the system though.",
            "If someone has an active suicide plan, but they are not at home, how do you go about the ESI?",
            "So if someone who expresses active suicidal thoughts agrees to a safety plan, an ESI would not be needed? How do you know the texters aren't lying about their intentions and just telling you what you want to hear so as not to cause red flags?",
            "Glad to hear",
            "[removed]",
            "That's a really interesting question, so when an ESI is activated a supervisor will place a call to the nearest PSAP (Public service answering point) this info would be know from an area code. From there the 911 dispatcher would be able to track the texter's location and send help.",
            "If a Texter has confirmed, yes, to all the intimate risk questions, thoughts, plan, means, timeframe. A safety plan needs to be reached and agreed to before the conversation closes. \n\nLet\u2019s say this person who has all four closes the conversation while creating safety plan an ESI will still be needed. \n\nThe safety plan must be reached and agreed to, so there is no ESI in this type of example. \n\nAnd we really don\u2019t know if the texters are lying, I can guarantee some of them probably are. But there really is only so much we can do unfortunately. Sometimes you can tell if people are not as interested in the planning because they directly say they don\u2019t want to do it at first or they just are very dry when discussing it.\n\nAs I said that we see ESI as a last resort, therefore, if a plan is reached and agreed to there will not be one.",
            "I promise it\u2019s the last one haven\u2019t heard a word from the moderators lol",
            "Dbad",
            "Thank you for all the answers. Many times I have NOT reached out because I was afraid of cops knocking down my door, if I did. You've eased those fears. It sounds like that doesn't happen nearly as often as I was afraid it did.",
            "I am so glad I was able to help extinguish some of those fears! We really never want to send help, because we believe you are able to make that decision for yourself. \n\nAnd some facts that may also help, in 2023 Crisis Text Line had 1.33 million conversations, of which about 6,000 needed an ESI. \n\nWe are always here to help at 741-741 :)"
