I have lived in River Falls my entire life and raised my family here. I spent my career in healthcare, beginning as a nurse before returning to school and transitioning to healthcare administration, retiring as the CEO of the hospital in a nearby town. I was on the local school board for over 17 years before stepping down in 2000. Last year I ran and was reelected to the school board, where I now serve.\n\nAssembly District 30, like all of Wisconsin, has been gerrymandered for the last 14 years, but the recent supreme court decision changed everything. Now the Democratic Party has a path to winning the majority in the legislature, but this path is narrow. AD30 is roughly 51% R, 49% D and is a must win to retake the State Assembly.\n\nI am running because I am tired of seeing a state legislature too busy playing politics to address problems facing the folks in western Wisconsin. I want western Wisconsin to remain a great place to live, work, and play for the next generation. This means:\n\nIncreasing access to healthcare in western Wisconsin, including comprehensive reproductive healthcare free from government intervention\n\nInvesting in public education to ensure that our students are prepared for good careers and higher education.\n\nFighting for clean air, water, and soil, so that our natural resources remain beautiful and safe.\n\nSupport local businesses and promoting economic development.\n\nProtecting democracy and the will of the people.\n\nI look forward to your questions.\n\nhttps://www.pageforwardwisconsin.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pageforwardwisconsin/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/people/Alison-Page-for-Wisconsin-State-Assembly-District-30/100084026091464/\n_____________________\n\n[This is a crosspost - click here to ask questions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1dnj5lv/my_name_is_alison_page_i_am_the_democratic/)",

She spiraled (mania, delusion, mood swings, hallucinating) and we managed to admit her to the psychiatric ward after 7 days postpartum and started medication (olanzapine) then. It took her like 9 months to a year to get back to normal. What happened in that 7 days that had such long lasting effect? Also we were told she has a high chance of reoccurring (50%?). I would like to understand why and also what are the steps that I can take if it happens again? *Touch wood as we're a couple weeks away for our 2nd\n\nAs far as we know, she has no history of mental illness nor depression until that episode.",

It seemed like everyone around me was constantly pushing themselves to the brink, and I wondered why I couldn\u2019t do the same. I felt like I was supposed to treat my body and mind like a high-performing machine\u2014always running, always producing.\n\nThen I began a journey that completely shifted my perspective. I took a humorous and honest look at the pressures we face and our obsession with self-improvement. I realized the absurdity of the self-help industry and started to embrace stillness as a form of rebellion against societal norms.\n\nMy book, \u201cI\u2019m Tired, Not Lazy\u201d, isn\u2019t just another guide on how to be better or do more. It's a wake-up call, encouraging readers to let go of soul-crushing obligations and focus on their well-being. It teaches the revitalizing power of taking a step back and embracing simplicity, helping you reclaim your vitality through acceptance and small, everyday practices.\n\nThe approach is simple, playful, and creative, with exercises designed to help you recognize and address negative influences. It\u2019s about cultivating natural reactions and gradually shifting your perspective. Through this journey, you\u2019ll start to rediscover your true self and recharge your life. Remember, imperfections are what make our stories unique, and joy can be found in the most unconventional places.\n\nThis is my first book, and I haven't sold many copies of it yet. I don't have any reviews on it, even though I've already heard from readers who've found the book transformative. Why haven't I sold many copies or received reviews? Probably because I don't have a lot of money to promote it, and I don't have any TikTok influencer friends. Also I want to clarify that while I\u2019m thrilled to share these insights, I'm not just another voice in the self-help industry. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been there, who\u2019s felt the crushing weight of societal expectations, and who\u2019s found a way to thrive by embracing my true self.\n\nI\u2019m Emily E.
