            "If we are talking about social media there's a very, very long list.\n\nGamers love to hate on everything",
            "Borderlands 3, the story is horrendous, but the gameplay is honestly good",
            "Just my 2 cents but from what Ive observed, Spider-man 2018 brought a whole new standard for Spider-man games. Spider-man 2 didnt add a drastic change/upgrade like that. But it doesnt mean its not great, it just didnt wow people the same way.",
            "Sonic Unleashed imo. The day stages are praised as being some of the best in the series, but the night stages get the hate. Personally, I enjoy the night stages, but feel like they drag on for a bit too long. I also enjoy the difficulty, especially Eggmanland.",
            "Literally every game. You can say Zelda BOTW is your favorite game ever and you'll have a ton of people calling it empty and bland then a bunch of other zelda fans call you \"a fake fan\" for like BOTW over OOT. Or you can say Halo Infinite is your favorite game then get rauled by the community the same way because you \"don't like 3 or Reach\" but it's probably because those games are too old for newer gamers to enjoy to the fullest.",
            "Cyberpunk from people who are still stuck in 2020.",
            "I think Spider-man 2 got a ton of hate because the two games before it had much better stories. The story in SM2 was okay, but both SM1 and SMMM blow it out of the water",
            "Alan Wake framchise. The ammount of hate I found holy shit",
            "Spider-Man 2 it's such a weird paradox. \n\nIt's the most acclaimed Spider-Man game both by critics and players (just look at Metacritic, if you don't believe me) and yet it's a divisive topic on Reddit."

            "I remember they gave Doom 2016 a 7 and had a ton of nonexistent negatives stuff to say about it being like any other boring shooter (which obviously it wasn't) for some reason without praising every cool innovative thing it did. And it was right when they kept giving annual releases of actual repetitive FPS games that did the exact thing as last year better scores.",

            "Not a review, but their Halo Infinite Oddball multiplayer gameplay was laughable",
            "That one reviewer for plagiarizing anothers review on Dead Cells I believe it was only to deny the allegations.",
            "We all know IGN is a trash pander network now for sure. \n\nRegardless , going Death Stranding a 6/10 was wild to me. Call it a walking simulator if you want, but that game had so much going for it. Was unique. Had an ALL STAR cast, amazing mocap and updates on updates of free shit.",

            "If you owned a Wii, extremely high chance is that you also owned Wii Sports. One of the few games where EVERYONE was easily able to pick up and play.\n\nI cant speak for Resort. I wasnt aware of that game until only a few years ago. Im glad I didnt know though as it likely would have tainted how much fun I had with Pilotwings Resort on 3DS on release had I known the same island was reused."
