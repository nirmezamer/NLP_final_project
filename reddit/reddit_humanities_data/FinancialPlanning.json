            "Should I contribute to my company-offered HSA even if our health insurance coverage is top-notch?",
            "If I have 90k in my business account but the business is just me paying myself $5k/mo (taxed to 3500ish) into a savings account, should I be keeping the business account leaner? Do I put it in a hysa? Do I dump a portion into stocks?",
            "I am seriously debating taking a small withdrawal from my money market account to pay off cc debt. I dont expect any tax ramifications since its money I moved from one bank account to another, but I am not sure how to make sure I dont end up back in this mess. Is there anything Im overlooking if I do make that withdrawal? I dont want to touch Roth or anything along the lines of that.",
            "I have shares in a young company that has seen its valuations grow by quite a lot with more expected. I know I technically cant access that value directly because theyre just shares in a company,  basically I just own notes saying that I have X amount of shares. \n\nIve heard about SBLOC and the idea that if my shares are in a bank then they can put a lien against them and give me a liquid loan or credit line. My question is where the HELL and how the hell do I put my shares so that I can access some of that value in the short term?",
            "Yes. The HSA is the single best retirement account available. It is contributed pre-tax and withdrawals are tax free on contributions and growth for eligible expenses. Maxing it out should be the prioritized next step after getting your 401k company match and before any further 401k or IRA contributions. Save it for retirement instead of using it on your deductible for maximum tax benefit. Even if you didn't save it for retirement and instead use it on immediate medical expenses, you're still getting tax free medical care.",
            "If your business doesn't have any possible expenses, just keep a few months in there. Give yourself a 70k bonus. If your business does have expenses, you could decide to put it in a money market fund, savings account, CD, or fully invest it, depending on your cash flow needs.",
            "If its simple a MMF then its sort of like your emergency fund. So either sell the shares or setup a funds transfer. Not sure your brokerage so not sure how it works for your MMF.\n\nWont incur taxes on the fund transfer.",
            "1) I'm looking for a substitution for disability insurance. The quotes I was getting weren't terrible I guess, but I'd rather invest that money for myself than give it to the insurance company in the hopes of not needing to use it.\n\nI was thinking about a High Yield Dividend Fund, maybe some bonds in there for added security.\n\nWhat would be the best vehicle for something like this, as I already contribute 400/mo to my Roth IRA, just a taxable brokerage, a second Roth IRA?\n\n2) How does a Solo 401k work for an 1099 independent contractor? If they don't have their own business entity how do you separate the business contributions and the individual contributions?",
            "An HSA is still a great tax advantaged account option to have - you must be covered by a qualifying high deductible health plan ([HDHP](https://www.uhc.com/understanding-health-insurance/understanding-health-insurance-costs/health-savings-accounts)) to be able to contribute to an HSA though - for more info on the benefits of HSAs you can search the sub, they come up fairly frequently (such as [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/s/fcmeMPycmL) or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/s/lZaawf9cpO))"

The father is opting for a cash advance on child support payments so he can move on with his life. \nI\u2019m planning to put the money into S&P 500 or mutual fund investment account so I can withdraw what I would have been getting monthly from him but accrue at the same time. \nWould you recommend throwing some into a 529 right away or stick with just investing or something else? I have a 529 already and will be investing my own money (planning on ~$2k to start and ~200/month). \nI want the money to be used entirely for paying for anything my son would need: childcare, diapers, food, extracurriculars, etc. \nAny advice is appreciated!

            "Talk to a financial advisor. Its not wise to invest everything in the S&P 500 index and taking money out monthly. Theyll be able to help focus on income planning and $330k is certainly enough to make it worth everyones time. You dont want to make a big mistake with this.",
            "You can put in HYSA for around 5.4% and that will bring you around $1485/month.",
            "High yield savings account for everything you need in the next 2 years. CD laddering for years 2-5. Safe treasury bonds for anything you need years 5-10. S&P 500 for anything after year 10. (529 is great too, and thats a tax vehicle. So put it in 529 and put that money in s&P 500)",
            "If its cash in a taxable account dont invest into a mutual fund. They are tax inefficient and spin off capital gains even when not distributing money. If you decide to do an sp500 index use an ETF instead of mutual fund",
            "While you're figuring it out, HYSA.  Betterment HYSA is 5.0% (holding steady for many months, rather than a promotional rate that banks seem to offer in rotation then dip below 5%), it spreads your money into different banks offering the best rate at the time.  All FDIC insured even if total is over what could be insured at one bank (250k I believe)",
            "IMO if you are planning 2k and $200 a month I would just keep the $4400 and invest the rest .. that way the money will be invested a year and you will only pay 15% on gains .. after a year in the market you could also reevaluate.. and do a lump sum withdrawal again the following year ..  I would have no problem putting it all in VOO or SPLG or FXAIX we have more than what you are talking about invested in snp500 and plan to buy more ..",
            "Put half in spyi will pay about 1200/mo put the other half in VOO. And gift it to your son when he is 21.",
            "For this amount, you can check out managed portfolios according to your own risk tolerance. Are you risk averse? Or you won't worry about short term ups and downs?\n\nAlso, keep the amount you need for the next year in a cash account. It's better than invest and then take money out every month.",
            "I understand the desire to keep the money separate to be used only for your son, but the reality is that your lives and finances are intermingled and will be for some time.  I think it would be a better approach to focus on the things you want to be able to provide for your son and yourself and work out a financial plan that includes your full financial picture.  The lump sum is a great resource for long term investments, whereas future income would provide a better fit to pay for ongoing things like extracurriculars and food.  Trying to separate yours and his money into completely separate budgets could lead to a worse overall result.",

            "That is a good start, and will cover emergency costs for a college student. Key would be to consistently building up the habit of saving up.",
            "Definitely a great start! I would look into a Roth IRA or look into Index funds and park that money in something relatively safe like VOO. Start to listen to podcasts and read books on personal finance. Once you figure out what will work best for you, continue to contribute. I cannot stress this enough! Even if it's $25 a week or $50 for the month, even less, contribute what you can. Compounding interest is an incredible thing and the earlier you start to invest the better it works for you. There are a lot of free calculators online that you can plug rough numbers into and get an idea of what your investment and monthly/weekly contributions will look like 20, 30, 40 years down the road.",
            "Yes sir! Do you plan to get a job while in college? Might be good to have some of that for emergencies. Try to stay away from high interest debt by using the money as a fall back.\n\nAlso have you looked into opening a Roth IRA to save for retirement. That $4000 could be worth $170k at retirement age if invested in something that returns 8% average annually. Thinking about this now could set you up for early retirement and tremendous success",
            "Yes i have that amount and im 41years old",

            "If you want to start a good habit, a Roth IRA is the best thing you can do.  Even if its $25 a month to start, but make sure you increase it whenever you make more money.  At your age you could literally have millions at retirement.  DO NOT underestimate starting now.  If you started with $1000 and did nothing else, it would be worth $120,000 by retirement.  Of course you would keep adding to that over time, that how it turns into millions.  \n\nInvest in the S&P with dividends reinvested.  As you get more money you can expand into other things, but always keep that base S&P investment.",

            "If there is a will, there will either be a designated executor (probably family) or if none is specified, one will be assigned by a court during probate.  The executor will interpret the will's directions and if you are named, they are obligated to contact you.  I guess that's a problem if the executor is one of these family members that you must avoid.\n\nIf grandpa had any bank or investment accounts, these can be directly configured with beneficiaries and if so, they are transferred to heirs by the bank or brokerage.  This bypasses probate.  The firm will attempt to find you.  Note that some people foolishly neglect to configure or update beneficiaries, and if so, the accounts go into probate in the former case, or to someone inappropriate in the latter.\n\nYou might also want to post in r/EstatePlanning once you have some more information."
