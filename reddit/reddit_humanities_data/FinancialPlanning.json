            "If I have 90k in my business account but the business is just me paying myself $5k/mo (taxed to 3500ish) into a savings account, should I be keeping the business account leaner? Do I put it in a hysa? Do I dump a portion into stocks?",
            "1) I'm looking for a substitution for disability insurance. The quotes I was getting weren't terrible I guess, but I'd rather invest that money for myself than give it to the insurance company in the hopes of not needing to use it.\n\nI was thinking about a High Yield Dividend Fund, maybe some bonds in there for added security.\n\nWhat would be the best vehicle for something like this, as I already contribute 400/mo to my Roth IRA, just a taxable brokerage, a second Roth IRA?\n\n2) How does a Solo 401k work for an 1099 independent contractor? If they don't have their own business entity how do you separate the business contributions and the individual contributions?",
            "I am seriously debating taking a small withdrawal from my money market account to pay off cc debt. I don\u2019t expect any tax ramifications since it\u2019s money I moved from one bank account to another, but I am not sure how to make sure I don\u2019t end up back in this mess. Is there anything I\u2019m overlooking if I do make that withdrawal? I don\u2019t want to touch Roth or anything along the lines of that.",
            "I have shares in a young company that has seen its valuations grow by quite a lot with more expected. I know I technically can\u2019t access that value directly because they\u2019re just shares in a company,  basically I just own notes saying that I have X amount of shares. \n\nI\u2019ve heard about SBLOC and the idea that \u201cif my shares are in a bank then they can put a lien against them and give me a liquid loan or credit line\u201d. My question is where the HELL and how the hell do I put my shares so that I can access some of that value in the short term?",
            "An HSA is still a great tax advantaged account option to have - you must be covered by a qualifying high deductible health plan ([HDHP](https://www.uhc.com/understanding-health-insurance/understanding-health-insurance-costs/health-savings-accounts)) to be able to contribute to an HSA though - for more info on the benefits of HSAs you can search the sub, they come up fairly frequently (such as [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/s/fcmeMPycmL) or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/s/lZaawf9cpO))",
            "Yes. The HSA is the single best retirement account available. It is contributed pre-tax and withdrawals are tax free on contributions and growth for eligible expenses. Maxing it out should be the prioritized next step after getting your 401k company match and before any further 401k or IRA contributions. Save it for retirement instead of using it on your deductible for maximum tax benefit. Even if you didn't save it for retirement and instead use it on immediate medical expenses, you're still getting tax free medical care.",
            "If your business doesn't have any possible expenses, just keep a few months in there. Give yourself a 70k bonus. If your business does have expenses, you could decide to put it in a money market fund, savings account, CD, or fully invest it, depending on your cash flow needs.",
            "If it\u2019s simple a MMF then it\u2019s sort of like your emergency fund. So either sell the shares or setup a funds transfer. Not sure your brokerage so not sure how it works for your MMF.\n\nWon\u2019t incur taxes on the fund transfer."

I have a 529 already and will be investing my own money (planning on ~$2k to start and ~200/month). \nI want the money to be used entirely for paying for anything my son would need: childcare, diapers, food, extracurriculars, etc. \nAny advice is appreciated!

If you are able to place money into tax advantaged accounts like 529, Roth IRA, HSA, start maxing those out even if you just put it into a high yield savings. \n\nAgree with other posters to get with a financial advisor to find the best way to limit future tax burdens and grow the money responsibly. \n\n330k is a lot of money and it can work hard for you without taking on lots of risk.",
            "You can put in HYSA for around 5.4% and that will bring you around $1485/month.",
            "Talk to a financial advisor. It\u2019s not wise to invest everything in the S&P 500 index and taking money out monthly. They\u2019ll be able to help focus on income planning and $330k is certainly enough to make it worth everyone\u2019s time. You don\u2019t want to make a big mistake with this.",
            "If it\u2019s cash in a taxable account don\u2019t invest into a mutual fund. They are tax inefficient and spin off capital gains even when not distributing money. If you decide to do an sp500 index use an ETF instead of mutual fund",
            "There is no rush. There is no deadline. Take some time, decide what you want this money to do, then make a plan to put the money to work doing that. \n\nDo not fall for investing in highly commissioned, low return products like whole life, universal life, indexed annuities, variable annuities or mutual funds with sales loads.\n\nInvest in nothing that requires a complicated disclosure longer than a couple pages or that you can't read and immediately understand.",
            "High yield savings account for everything you need in the next 2 years. CD laddering for years 2-5. Safe treasury bonds for anything you need years 5-10. S&P 500 for anything after year 10. (529 is great too, and that\u2019s a tax vehicle. So put it in 529 and put that money in s&P 500)",
            "While you're figuring it out, HYSA.  Betterment HYSA is 5.0% (holding steady for many months, rather than a promotional rate that banks seem to offer in rotation then dip below 5%), it spreads your money into different banks offering the best rate at the time.  All FDIC insured even if total is over what could be insured at one bank (250k I believe)",
            "Just fyi, you can frontload 529\u2019s, and get the state income deductions on a rolling basis until it\u2019s used up. Eg., instead of adding $4k this year and next for the max tax break, add $8k today and then claim $4k of it each year for the next two years. The advantage is the money starts growing, capital gains tax free, today.\n\nOther than that, I think it would make sense to keep everything you\u2019ll need for the next 5 years in a hysa/bond ladder, and then put the rest in a fund tracking the s&p 500. It may also make sense to keep 10% of your investment in gold/I-bonds, and another several percent in energy, to hedge off long-tail risks.\n\nThis is not advice, as I\u2019m not qualified to give it, but  just putting things on your radar that you could talk to your advisor about.",

            "IMO if you are planning 2k and $200 a month I would just keep the $4400 and invest the rest .. that way the money will be invested a year and you will only pay 15% on gains .. after a year in the market you could also reevaluate.. and do a lump sum withdrawal again the following year ..  I would have no problem putting it all in VOO or SPLG or FXAIX \u2026we have more than what you are talking about invested in snp500 and plan to buy more .."

            "Good start but keep building it by doing some part time work. You will need the extra to support your social life, additional school costs, and continuing to build your savings.",
            "Definitely a great start! I would look into a Roth IRA or look into Index funds and park that money in something relatively safe like VOO. Start to listen to podcasts and read books on personal finance. Once you figure out what will work best for you, continue to contribute. I cannot stress this enough! Even if it's $25 a week or $50 for the month, even less, contribute what you can. Compounding interest is an incredible thing and the earlier you start to invest the better it works for you. There are a lot of free calculators online that you can plug rough numbers into and get an idea of what your investment and monthly/weekly contributions will look like 20, 30, 40 years down the road.",

Try to stay away from high interest debt by using the money as a fall back.\n\nAlso have you looked into opening a Roth IRA to save for retirement. That $4000 could be worth $170k at retirement age if invested in something that returns 8% average annually. Thinking about this now could set you up for early retirement and tremendous success",

The rent continues to rise and I have accepted that I will never be able to afford to own a home here. The plan is to move to the south, where I have family. We are both currently employed and make decent wages for middle class. Wife has a 401k with her current employer and has been putting the maximum percentage of her income into it for the last 16 years, while the employer matches it. We already understand the penalties for withdrawing the 401k before retirement age, I\u2019m not looking for advice about that. I already have work lined up in the area that we are moving to, but I want my wife to be able to take some time off and not have to work for a while. My question is, what would be the best use of the funds prior to applying for a home loan? Do we pay off our credit debt? Pay off the car? What do lenders look for when applying for a first time home loan? Why the hell didn\u2019t they teach us any of this in school? (Rhetorical)\nAny input is appreciated, thanks.",

The spending part you can either spend as you go, or save up for some kind of gift for yourself, gift for others, clothes, travel, whatever makes you happy.\n\nAfter a while you can see if the 50-50 split makes sense, or if you want to adjust the numbers.
