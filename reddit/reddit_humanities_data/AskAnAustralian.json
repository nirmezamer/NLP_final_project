            "Does every citizen have to full knowledge of immigration procedures? Or can we just leave it up to a few randoms on Reddit to answer the questions?",
            "Depends what industry you're in, finance are fuckwits the world over. But its likely like most places, plenty of sicophants everywhere you go.",
            "What exactly do you mean?",
            "Thankfully not finance, a small events firm (same area I\u2019ve been working in for a while). \n\nIt\u2019s more general stuff like do people bring lunch from home or eat out? Do people hangout after work or is there a big separation between work/home?",
            "All of those questions are, it depends. Yes and no, sometimes, but not always. Events people, hospo etc i think generally hang out.",
            "We had no idea about the driving licence rule either. My brother in law let us know as he works for Service NSW. Only place I\u2019ve even seen a notice so far was in the Service NSW waiting room or online where you\u2019d have to go looking.",
            "If you can, get a bank account and send in your Medicare enrolment form before you arrive. We found Medicare enrolment such a long process and it made some things like my son's preschool applications difficult because we needed things like BSB and bank Account number  (for fees) and Medicare number (for proof of his immunization). As well as registering with a GP etc. The main bank branches here are Com Bank and HSBC, both of which I think you can open a global account from your home country. You might even be able to walk in to a HSBC branch in the UK and ask for advice. The only things we needed was ID and a postal address which we gave my sister in laws because we spent the first 2 months in Air B&Bs.\nRegister for your Tax File Number as soon as you arrive (this process was actually incredibly quick and easy).\n\nI think they've recently updated the legislation that says overseas drivers need to convert to an Australian license within six months of arriving or face a fine. This again was very quick and easy and if you're coming from a country with similar driving rules (we came from the UK too) it's a straight transfer. It took less than half an hour at a Service NSW center.\n\nI've been working for just over a month now (we arrived in Jan and I took some time off to get settled/look for a new job) and there doesn't seem to be so much of an after-work pub culture, especially not in my workplace. People tend to occasionally go for lunch together but not drinks so much. People want to get home to their families.",
            "This is super useful - thank you!\n\nWas already aware of bank situation; was going to use comm bank which should be fine. \n\nAppreciate other advice, wasn\u2019t aware of driving licence rule so good to know. \n\nThanks so much; excited to arrive!"

            "My partner hated the way everything was put on top of everything and when he ordered his food he would state that the food was to be served separate nothing other than the sauce was to be put on top of anything or the meal would be returned and would have to be replaced. If they said that they couldn\u2019t do that we would leave. We only had to do that once and after the meal was served as ordered. Both of us didn\u2019t want soggy chips or salad."

I wish school curriculums could include how to become a homeowner program or something bc now I\u2019m in uni and I have no idea what to expect or how much to save up. All I know is that I should save up for a 20% deposit but seeing as Sydney is now the 2nd most expensive city in the world, I don\u2019t know how home-owning is an option now unless I work insanely hard and become rich. \n\nI know a lot of other people my age are also stressing about this but they all plan on moving to a different state. This is smart but I really want to stay in Sydney bc my life is here. \n\nWhat should I work towards and avoid trying to save up for a house?\n\nAny advice on buying a house in Sydney would be appreciated (if you could also talk about what\u2019s the process of buying a house / costs etc. pls thanks).

            "If you\u2019re in Sydney yeah you\u2019re fucked, move to Brisbane, though even here can\u2019t get a house, can get a 2 bedroom apartment though or townhouse for $550k",
            "Honestly? Don't bother. Prepare to build a life somewhere else, at your age it's EXTREMELY daunting thinking about moving away from everything you know, but as someone who grew up here and am almost 30 I'm going to be leaving very soon. Looking at Wollongong or even further south. Though I personally don't like Sydney and what it's becoming. You might find that the people you feel are keeping you here will move away anyway. My best friend is about to go to QLD with her husband, another is in London, one is in the blue mountains, one is in Tamworth. You just deal with it, technology makes it easy to stay in touch anyway which is lucky. As I've gotten older I've decided what I want out of life is peace and quiet and to live a comfortable life where I can do what I want within reason without stressing about fucking everything. Just do your best during your 20s to save a bit but don't miss out on stuff for it. Live your life, you'll figure out where you want to land eventually, but unfortunately if you don't have parents who can help you with a loan or enter a high earning career fast, Sydney isn't worth it anymore. You'll get used to the idea, just give it time and don't lose your head over it now.",
            "Stay at home, study/get into a trade, work and save up while not having to pay rent. Help your family out. \n\nWhen ready, buy somewhere. Even if it means moving elsewhere. But that alone will put you above others",
            "My advice is to save up and buy before having kids or wait until they\u2019re well and truly in school. The cost of childcare is almost the same cost as rent for some people (depending on your subsidy). It\u2019s almost impossible to save while kids are in daycare.",
            "I'm sorry it's rough out there. I'm the gen above you, and it's honestly not realistic for a lot of people in my bracket either. Sydney makes it near impossible unless you're born to wealth or have a crazy high paying job. There isn't really a secret formula that they can teach you at school to make it easier. Your best hope  is that the market crashes at some point and that they regulate foreign investors, but even then, it's going to be admittedly a very tight market in Sydney and the wider Sydney area. \n\nGeneral advice if your goal is to own a home would be to : save as much as you can (20% being the goal) and live with your parents as long as you can then buy an investment property (outside Sydney) that you can possibly afford with hard work. From then, keep saving more money and then putting that asset house towards collateral or reselling at a higher price to buy closer to Sydney. Otherwise... trying to form a co-op and co buying a house with a group of friends to get on the property market . I will reiterate, though, that none of this will be easy, though, but best of luck.",
            "That\u2019s the fun part. We\u2019re not",
            "I read somewhere recently that the average age of first home ownership in Australia is now 32. I\u2019d imagine most of these are double income.\n\nSo basically it\u2019s not possible unless you have a wealthy family who are willing to prop you up.",
            "Live with your parents untill 30. Then buy a house. Doesn't work for everyone but it's one method.\n\nDon't stress about it. Just be flexible with your jobs and get one where you can live. I work and live in the remote burbs. Best of both worlds."
