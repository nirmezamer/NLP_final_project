            "Where should I go in Australia right now to work July-October?\n\nI started my WHV in 2023, and I traveled the east coast then worked in North QLD in hospitality for a few months. I popped over to Asia, but now I\u2019m coming back to find work. I mostly finished my regional work/88 days (farm work or hospitality in remote areas), but I want to do at least a month more to make sure and save up some money. I love living near the beach or any body of water but would be open to anywhere. Thanks for any suggestions!!",

            "If you can, get a bank account and send in your Medicare enrolment form before you arrive. We found Medicare enrolment such a long process and it made some things like my son's preschool applications difficult because we needed things like BSB and bank Account number  (for fees) and Medicare number (for proof of his immunization). As well as registering with a GP etc. The main bank branches here are Com Bank and HSBC, both of which I think you can open a global account from your home country. You might even be able to walk in to a HSBC branch in the UK and ask for advice. The only things we needed was ID and a postal address which we gave my sister in laws because we spent the first 2 months in Air B&Bs.\nRegister for your Tax File Number as soon as you arrive (this process was actually incredibly quick and easy).\n\nI think they've recently updated the legislation that says overseas drivers need to convert to an Australian license within six months of arriving or face a fine. This again was very quick and easy and if you're coming from a country with similar driving rules (we came from the UK too) it's a straight transfer. It took less than half an hour at a Service NSW center.\n\nI've been working for just over a month now (we arrived in Jan and I took some time off to get settled/look for a new job) and there doesn't seem to be so much of an after-work pub culture, especially not in my workplace. People tend to occasionally go for lunch together but not drinks so much. People want to get home to their families.",
            "What exactly do you mean?",
            "Thankfully not finance, a small events firm (same area I\u2019ve been working in for a while). \n\nIt\u2019s more general stuff like do people bring lunch from home or eat out? Do people hangout after work or is there a big separation between work/home?",
            "This is super useful - thank you!\n\nWas already aware of bank situation; was going to use comm bank which should be fine. \n\nAppreciate other advice, wasn\u2019t aware of driving licence rule so good to know. \n\nThanks so much; excited to arrive!",
            "All of those questions are, it depends. Yes and no, sometimes, but not always. Events people, hospo etc i think generally hang out.",
            "We had no idea about the driving licence rule either. My brother in law let us know as he works for Service NSW. Only place I\u2019ve even seen a notice so far was in the Service NSW waiting room or online where you\u2019d have to go looking."
