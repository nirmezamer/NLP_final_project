        "content": "**Welcome!**, and congratulations on your new gaming laptop! Make sure to keep the box and papers that came with your laptop intact, just in case you need to return it later.\n\n*To ensure a smooth start with your new device, we recommend following these steps:*\n\n1. Fully charge and drain your laptop battery on first use to re-calibrate it.\n2. Run Windows Update to install necessary security updates and drivers. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.\n3. Once Windows Update is complete, visit the Nvidia website to download the recommended driver for your graphics card. Ask for a recommendation in our Discord server's questions channel if you need help.\n4. After the download, execute the .exe and select \"custom\" install. Then, choose \"clean install\" to ensure everything installs correctly.\n5. Restart your device to complete the installation.\n6. Configure Windows settings to your preference, and consider removing McAfee if it came pre-installed.\n7. Open the Windows Store and check for updates. Once the updates are complete, open Lenovo Vantage.\n8. When opening Vantage, it will prompt you to continue the installation. Proceed with the installation.\n9. For now, we recommend leaving Lenovo Vantage settings on stock and trying out the different power modes using the FN+Q shortcut.\n10. Finally, it's a good idea to check your laptop physically and run a benchmark/stress test. Notebookcheck.net has a helpful guide on how to do this: [**https://www.notebookcheck.net/Guide-How-to-check-a-new-laptop-for-issues.232476.0.html**](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Guide-How-to-check-a-new-laptop-for-issues.232476.0.html)\n\nPlease note that while we normally suggest updating drivers through the Lenovo support site, we recommend testing your device for a week before updating.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your new Legion device, and don't hesitate to ask for help or advice in our community!",

            "Enable Battery Conservation in Vantage if ya are going to keep it plugged most of the time",
            "Lenovo Legion Toolkit (Free)\n\nUninstall Vantage and get Lenovo Legion Toolkit. A light weight and more intuitive program that IMO is more powerful than Vantage. The dev has seriously been crushing it with the latest updates. My favorite addition he added is customizable actions that will run when the laptop either gets plugged in/unplugged, for example, when my laptop gets unplugged, it automatically goes into the (blue) quiet mode and trackpad enabled and inversely, the laptop will go into balanced mode and trackpad disabled when the laptop gets plugged back in.\n\nhttps://github.com/BartoszCichecki/LenovoLegionToolkit\n\nLegion Fan Control (Free)\n\nAlso, download Legion Fan Control to be able to setup customizable fan curves (if interested)\n\nhttps://www.legionfancontrol.com\n\nMicrosoft Power Toys (Free)\n\nAlso, download Microsoft Power Toys, a small program that has many features and  adds a lot of functionality to your computer and is free. My 2 most used are PT Awake and PT Run. If you have a Mac this is basically \u201cCaffeine/Amphetamine\u201d and \u201cAlfred\u201d.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/",

            "I heard that McAfee is just bloatware. I see it is pre-installed. Should I really uninstall it? Sorry coming from a Mac so not too familiar.",
            "1) Disable windows fast startup if you want to not have annoying AF stutters every 5-60 minutes. Seriously. You have no idea how much trouble this caused. I had given up and committed to never buying Lenovo again until I randomly came across a solution. It\u2019s not Lenovo specific. It\u2019s just a terrible feature.\n\n2) Get rid of the battery and performance killer that is ICUE. You can keep your RGB profiles. Here\u2019s a vid. https://youtu.be/UTX-KpQqD-4. Or switch to OpenRGB, but the video instructions is the lightest weight alternative. Bonus: no more rave lights on startup/shut down - keep your profile throughout!\n\n3) See other top comment about getting rid of the Vantage bloatware and also do that.",

            "I didn't fully charge and drain my battery upon first start-up, is it worth doing it now over a month later? I'm new to gaming laptops.",
            "Not Legion specific but if you have 2 SSD drives you can set the page file on the \"Non Windows\" drive and speed up the boot process.  Its not by much but its noticable.  \n\nTo get to the \"Virtual Memory\" (Page File Settings) right click \"This Computer\" and bring up properties and go to advanced system settings, or search for \"advance system settings\" go the the advanced tab, click on Performance Options> advance> Virtual Memory > Change > And then remove the paging file from the windows drive and put a system managed file on the other drive.\n\nAgain - no performance gain if you don't have 2 physical drives.  You can always delete the paging file but windows can start having strange issues at times even if you have a ton of ram.",
