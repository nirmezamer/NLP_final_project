        "content": "**Welcome!**, and congratulations on your new gaming laptop! Make sure to keep the box and papers that came with your laptop intact, just in case you need to return it later.\n\n*To ensure a smooth start with your new device, we recommend following these steps:*\n\n1. Fully charge and drain your laptop battery on first use to re-calibrate it.\n2. Run Windows Update to install necessary security updates and drivers. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.\n3. Once Windows Update is complete, visit the Nvidia website to download the recommended driver for your graphics card. Ask for a recommendation in our Discord server's questions channel if you need help.\n4. After the download, execute the .exe and select \"custom\" install. Then, choose \"clean install\" to ensure everything installs correctly.\n5. Restart your device to complete the installation.\n6. Configure Windows settings to your preference, and consider removing McAfee if it came pre-installed.\n7. Open the Windows Store and check for updates. Once the updates are complete, open Lenovo Vantage.\n8. When opening Vantage, it will prompt you to continue the installation. Proceed with the installation.\n9. For now, we recommend leaving Lenovo Vantage settings on stock and trying out the different power modes using the FN+Q shortcut.\n10. Finally, it's a good idea to check your laptop physically and run a benchmark/stress test. Notebookcheck.net has a helpful guide on how to do this: [**https://www.notebookcheck.net/Guide-How-to-check-a-new-laptop-for-issues.232476.0.html**](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Guide-How-to-check-a-new-laptop-for-issues.232476.0.html)\n\nPlease note that while we normally suggest updating drivers through the Lenovo support site, we recommend testing your device for a week before updating.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your new Legion device, and don't hesitate to ask for help or advice in our community!",
