            "I don't know what ongoing romance to read once this ends \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone dropping recs!",
            "Oh god, you can definitely see that the end is near: all characters are present, even Takao and Hino made an appearance; most of the panels had no dialogue. I\u2019m really going to miss this beautiful manga. On the other hand, we got another callback and of course, the kiss, which made me feel so happy",
            "Awwww... They're so cute together. I'm getting all choked up from how happy they make eachother.",
            "I love how even though they have kissed and are an official couple, they still get flustered in the couples part of the forest",
            "I love how we have gotten to the point where we know these guys so well that even the empty panels can speak volumes on how they are feeling. Can\u2019t wait to see the last two chapters!",
            "It's such a sweet chapter I have tears in my eyes. I've been reading since 2018. Those times when I was in a dark place and lonely this manga helped me. Now my life's a lot better and I've been in a relationship for 2 years. I'm thankful for this series.",
            "\u201cOnly 2 chapters left\u201d words never hurt me this much",
            "I'm torn. On one hand, I want more Nagatoro. On the other hand, the closer we are to the end. But let me just say it's been one hell of a ride, and I'm so happy to see these two together.",
            "FIREWORK KISS! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!!\n\n\u00a0God, I\u2019m gonna miss this manga\u2026 Still can\u2019t believe it\u2019ll come to an end soon\u2026"

            "I've been thinking a lot about how the art style has changed and progressed through the whole story. I'm not really sure how to intelligently describe  it, lol.  But I know what I'm seeing and noticing. The best I can come up with is that it looks as though the artwork has grown up a bit. I'm not saying that the original few chapters were childish or that they were worse. They were excellent. But the visual change is very evident. \n\nThe manga as a whole has a constant shifting in art style. It's very subtle, but it's there.",
            "I think that the manga was simply successful and the production made a few more assistants available to him.  I remember the countless tweets where Nanashi complained about being overwhelmed with work.  Suddenly they then disappeared, just in conjunction with the different stylistic trait.  Probably now he has more time to dedicate himself to attention to detail.",
            "I also noticed the change in the cover art. Or I don't know if it's just the depiction of Nagatoro's wet hair.",
            "Nah there\u2019s definitely a shift in the cover art, too. Though, I don\u2019t really notice it in the hair, more so the proportions and the shape of her face",
            "Sakura\u2019s appearances (both her actually showing up, and her looks) acts as a pretty good marker of the bigger artistic milestones in this series, I\u2019m just realizing. \n\nShe\u2019s in the first two chapters, when the style hasn\u2019t changed much from the doujins. \n\nBy the time she reappears, the art settles into essentially how the anime would look. \n\nAnd by the time she grows her hair longer, the art again had shifted, but more subtly and gradually, and the manga\u2019s the best is ever looked\n\nIt ain\u2019t that deep, I\u2019m probably just crazy"
