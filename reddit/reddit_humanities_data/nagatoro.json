I\u2019m really going to miss this beautiful manga. On the other hand, we got another callback and of course, the kiss, which made me feel so happy",

            "Sakura\u2019s appearances (both her actually showing up, and her looks) acts as a pretty good marker of the bigger artistic milestones in this series, I\u2019m just realizing. \n\nShe\u2019s in the first two chapters, when the style hasn\u2019t changed much from the doujins. \n\nBy the time she reappears, the art settles into essentially how the anime would look. \n\nAnd by the time she grows her hair longer, the art again had shifted, but more subtly and gradually, and the manga\u2019s the best is ever looked\n\nIt ain\u2019t that deep, I\u2019m probably just crazy",
            "I've been thinking a lot about how the art style has changed and progressed through the whole story. I'm not really sure how to intelligently describe  it, lol.  But I know what I'm seeing and noticing. The best I can come up with is that it looks as though the artwork has grown up a bit. I'm not saying that the original few chapters were childish or that they were worse. They were excellent. But the visual change is very evident. \n\nThe manga as a whole has a constant shifting in art style. It's very subtle, but it's there.",
            "I think that the manga was simply successful and the production made a few more assistants available to him.  I remember the countless tweets where Nanashi complained about being overwhelmed with work.  Suddenly they then disappeared, just in conjunction with the different stylistic trait.  Probably now he has more time to dedicate himself to attention to detail.",
            "I also noticed the change in the cover art. Or I don't know if it's just the depiction of Nagatoro's wet hair.",
            "Nah there\u2019s definitely a shift in the cover art, too. Though, I don\u2019t really notice it in the hair, more so the proportions and the shape of her face"

But eventually i cool down when season 2 drops and i really started to enjoy the show goofiness and the character    \ndevelopment of the couple. So from hating those two to liking them i'm glad I feel that way now cuz if i were to still hate on them i would probably drop this anime a while back.",

            "I think I felt a similar way when I first started the manga, and I think that aspect is purposeful on Nanashi's part. To show just how much they've matured from the start of the series to where we are now.",
            "I knew my first impression of Senpai wasn't the best. Expected him to be a spineless dweeb, he's actually low-key a gigachad.",
            "I loved them from the start. I relate to Senpai a lot and I thought Nagatoro was (and still is) funny. Instant win for me",
            "I can agree with that. Between that and cultural differences, I was like, what? But it ended up being done really well. Each of their flaws or accentuated personality traits helped add to their characters and led to a better story overall.  I think the biggest learning curve for me was learning that when nagatoro said gross it could mean a myriad off different things. I learned that most in the manga itself.",
            "Didnt hate senpai, but Nagatoro.... i think it was in ep2 where she physically hurt him.kicked him to the ditch? That was too much. But then next ep rolls around, she got jelly about Yoshi touching his hair. Then it clicked. Still, hurting senapi like that.",
            "From the second part title of the first episode: \u201cSenpai, don\u2019t you ever get angry?\u201d I knew exactly how the story would play out. \n\nI was perfectly fine with the two characters from the beginning because I knew they would NOT jump into the romance early. Nanashi gave the characters time to develop and grow until they were ready for each other.",
            "I can\u2019t relate I never seen this anime I think",
            "That's what I love about this series. These two start off as toxic losers who have extreme self-confidence issues & they're unable to treat other people with respect. But through pure shenanigans, they end up becoming one of the best examples of a healthy couple. They know how to respect others & themselves, they can set boundaries, & they're just madly in love with each other. Romance stories where the main characters have actual character development is so peak.",
            "To be upfront, I had similar impressions and stopped reading after the first chapter.  I wanted to slap both of them\u2014Nagatoro-san for bullying, Hatchiouji-san for just taking it up the chocolate starfish and not fighting back.\n\nEventually, I gave the series a chance and I\u2019m so happy that I did.",
