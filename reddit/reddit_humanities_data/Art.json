        "content": "For a couple of weeks we've been getting messages from users not being able to post on this sub: the Post button remains greyed out. The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.\n\nAnd yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly.",

            "[This will be a tad off topic, and a tad entirely due to this issue but I'll warn whoever has the sparsity in their time to read further that it's a little long/drawn out as I have a tendency to do with my utterings but thought I'd share since I know it's not related to my phone's recent issues -WITH. EVERYTHING- not just reddit or this sub] \n\n -- ANYWAYYYS, ahh thanks for the notifying!! I was recently having (still am actually), completely unexplainable and unrelated troubles with my phone, my internet/data (not allowing me to go on normal websites IE googles homepage even or YouTube, and Cashapp not working or contactless payments in general etc)\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab at the exact same time when I tried to make a post and it wouldn't allow me.\nNeedless to say I- understandably so; thought it was correlating to this much larger issue with my phone & have been in constant contact with Google support, Cashapp, Android Customer Service, etc-- long story short...\nUpon the 17th time explaining my situation and the billion random albeit super debilitating issues with my phone & account/inaccessibility to yet another CS rep (different one each time)- he told me that the only explanation that he actually has was that he doesn't have one and has no idea himself why this was happening to me and was just as stumped as i, myself.. AND I'm a web[3]/software engineer & dev so its been even more frustrating..\nBut the same man from India (as he explained later), also told me that he can assure me that he was recently trying to utilize the art sub-reddit and couldn't post either & we actually connected & had a 15 min additional, non-issue related, totally comforting conversation via our similar online presences & intrigues and come to find out he was also a NFT artist & had actually, outbid me on a Low Effort Punk a couple weeks ago.\n\nRandom issue entirely, random conversation, random coincidence, but it made me a little less hostile & angry at my phone and life in general that I'd be able to rest assured my issue/glitch with the sub-thread (Reddit in general really), was at the very least; not just my own frustration and experience and that it would handle itself eventually. \nAnd it has. Thanks again to the fantastic mods of one of my fav subs to peruse daily.",
            "This is starting to get really frustrating. Can't upload a simple image from my phone, imgur no longer provides direct links to images and I don't have a computer. Really wish somebody could just fix this ridiculous bug that's been happening for months now.",
