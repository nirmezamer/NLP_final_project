        "content": "For a couple of weeks we've been getting messages from users not being able to post on this sub: the Post button remains greyed out. The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.\n\nAnd yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly.",
