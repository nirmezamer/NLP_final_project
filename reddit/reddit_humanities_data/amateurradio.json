            "I have one of these. You can't buy them anymore. You could literally get people to fight over one if you put it out on a table at a hamfest. They go for north of $500 used.\n\nStill the best 2m-70cm APRS radio around. Nice score.",

He got it from another older ham who was very well known in amateur radio community in the city and wider (unfortunately he passed away in 2022). The radio is almost brand new except the mic which started to shed rubber and the PTT contact is not so good, so i decided to get a new one with DTMF. The model is TM-V71, dual bander VHF/UHF, max. 50 W power. How did I go? Any technical data about it / cool things it can do / experiences / price back in the day. ",

            "This is an AWESOME radio and the audio on it is stellar. I have the D700, the TM-G707 and my OM has the V71. The V71 is by far the best of the three Kenwoods I've used. You did really well considering these go for between $300 and $400 USD usually.",
            "Very nice. I checked them out, D700 seems very good. I've actually seen another one, The TM-D710G and it'll probably be my next radio. Someone also posted yesterday about scoring it on garage sale",
            "Pretty sure the V71 is basically the 710 with a different faceplate. I was told you can switch faceplates between them even.",
            "Very nice. But I thought like 710G has GPS and can do packet/APRS. I'm not sure if V71 can do that, but I've seen it has DATA and PC plug in the back",
            "Just FYI the D710G is what they have on the International Space Station.",

On the air practice is the best. Im at about 13 WPM on a straight key, and am comfortably having QSOs with a paddle at 15. Working on increasing speed.",

            "I'd guess that these are made similarly to the old \"miracle whip\" antennas. You can find schematics and a breakdown of the theory but they're pretty much a combined tuning unit where every dial click is a small amount of both capacitance and inductance.\n\nI'll admit I bought one. Never made any contacts on them but it's super simple to just spin the dial and try to get some wire or the telescopic whip down to 1:1 swr.\n\nHighly recommend you try what you mentioned last. Attempt a few different wire lengths and see what you find."
