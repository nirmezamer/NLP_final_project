However the game will have many references to Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2, and is considered a sequel as far as the story is concerned, so I recommend playing those first if you want to get the full experience.  \n  \n###\u2022 How many chapters are there in total?  \n  \n>!There are seven chapters total.!<\n  \n###\u2022 Why can't I equip accessories to Mwamba?  \n  \nJust keep playing the game. You'll unlock the ability to later.  \n  \n###\u2022 What does the Stalker class's \"Art Follow Up\" Field Buff do?  \n  \nWhen you use an art in the zone an additional projectile will be fired. The specifics of the damage, etc are unknown right now.  \n  \n###\u2022 Is there content that I can miss out on by progressing in the story?  \n  \nNo, you will always be able to go and do anything that you're afraid of missing.  \n  \n###\u2022 Why does it take me so long to level up my classes?  \n  \nThe amount of class XP you get seems to be based off of the CP earned from your fighting. Additionally, you won't gain any class XP from fighting something five or more levels below you.  \n  \n\n  \n------\n  \n## Use this thread to ask any question that doesn\u2019t warrant discussion, meaning questions that have one or two objectively correct answers.  \n  \n## Please try to word your question as spoiler free as possible.

But given the notable upsurge in fanart and the related increase in people complaining about borderline nsfw fanart, I was curious which side the majority of people sided with. I try to avoid acting for the vocal minority, so this poll will help influence the mod team's choices going forward.

            "I would like a dedicated \"No AI art rule.\" There have been a few posts that were clearly AI, and the mods have removed them, but having an explicit rule might reduce how many are attempted.",
            "The art is fine as is; in fact I'd say a few posts have been unfairly removed simply because people whined too hard about them (or kept spamming the mods until they got a sympathetic ear).\n\n  \nThis trend of trying to put anything remotely sexy or sexual into the same category as hardcore porn is not only but also a bit disturbing and worrying TBH. And it's not just this sub or community that does it either.",
            "Banning or restricting PG-13 fanart seems like a recipe for causing activity on this sub to bottom out.  There's not a whole lot in the way of Xenoblade news to talk about right now.",
            "So IMO (As in my opinion) the NSFW is really not that bad here. And as long as you mark it as 18+, i dont think there should be a problem since you can just hide 18+ content.",
            "I mean, we have a NSFW tag for a reason right? As long as its not straight up porn all the time, what does it matter the fan art being posted? Its the people's fault for not having NSFW photos hidden if its causing problems for them while in public. And if they dont like the posts, they can just, you know, keep scrolling? Ignore the post and move on with their day?",
            "Just to preface this - I've been a fan of the Xenoblade series since the New Nintendo 3DS. I am a smut writer and have written smut pieces for many franchises. I wrote for and researched \"Did You Know Gaming'\"s Xenoblade episode. Thus, I'm very sexually open and supportive of sex workers and NSFW content, and am a huge fan of the games.\n\nAs someone in my position, here's my two cents - this subreddit is way too big to allow art reposting, period. A majority of the fan art here - NSFW included - is done by serial reposters that do not produce content of their own, and I argue this behavior is spam. I would link specifics, but that would get my comment filtered by automod.\n\nIn my opinion - as a moderator myself - the best point of comparison I have is r/FireEmblem and r/FireEmblemHeroes. Those subreddits have strong OC-only, no AI fan art rules in an effort to curb karma farming. For a smaller subreddit with 10k-30k subscribers, fan art reposting is done to produce content where there is a dearth of it, and to share the work of talented fan artists.\n\nIn this subreddit, I believe that it has the *opposite effect* - in that it drowns out actual artists from sharing their works. I've had fan artist friends complain directly to me that their works don't get attention unless they pretend it's reposted - just because it's so damn *easy* to go on Pixiv and find someone else's art to post on this subreddit for karma farming.\n\nMy suggestion is to limit art reposting fullstop - I appreciate that you guys require source, but it's unfair that karma farmers are allowed to spam other people's works and drown out real artists and actual user engagement. I believe limiting reposting will reduce the amount of softcore porn/lewd works on the subreddit heavily, because it is a small amount of users that is setting the tone. (I originally linked three specific users here, but that got filtered by automod, whoops!)\n\nBlocking these users fixes the issue partially, but it shouldn't be on me as a user to have to moderate a subreddit - that's the job of the subreddit moderators. Again, please look to r/fireemblem for reference point - there's no reason to encourage karma farming when there's many many talented fan artists in the Xenoblade community.\n\nI also agree in that the mod team has self-selected partially with regards to this - the people who are turned off by the insane amount of art reposting of XBC2 characters have already unsubscribed. It's self-selection bias. Please listen to artists and creatives - I've asked a few of my artist friends to comment in this thread because they've *stopped posting on the subreddit because they deem it futile.*\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nedit: minor grammar fixes, sentence clarifications",
            "Most people here are fine with how art has always been handled here. We shouldn't have to change it because a small contingent of people are constantly annoying about it in the comments. The upvotes speak for themselves. Xenoblade 3 is old news now, and it isn't even as popular as Xenoblade 2 which is even older than that. There's really not many things to post about other than art, speculation, and memes or something. Most people here have played the games already and most discussion about the stories or whatever have been covered already. Just let it be until the next game is announced.",
            "I think people need to just understand that this is how series specific subs tend to go. When there isn't any actively new content happening for the series, you end up with a lot of art and other non-game related posting. God, just look at the state of something like r/danganronpa. Things could always be worse. The point is that if people are posting art to keep the sub afloat until there's something of actual worth to talk about again, then I say let people post art. What's the alternative? People are complaining about the presence of art, but it's not like those people are gonna take over for the art posters and start posting other stuff themselves. \n\nPeople are asking for the alternative to art to be literally nothing, and that's stupid.",
            "The rules are fine as they are, it's just the lack of other topics and discussions is making them more feel more prominent and arguably a bit overbearing. In other words, fanart is low-hanging fruit in the absence of everything else. Considering the number of active users has dropped over the past month or so, any change could easily put a damper on things unintentionally.\n\nOf course, that could all flip on a dime the moment something - ***anything*** \\- gets announced about the next game in the series. I think the long-overdue announcement of Nintendo's next console will likely have something for this series could be a factor, as it has been speculated & rumoured about for ages but it never seems to come around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd besides, this series has always had a presence of \"NSFW elements\" even as far back as *Xenogears*.\n\n* Scenes with nudity in *Xenogears*, be it either pixel art (Emeralda when she's first found) or barely covered by a lens flare in the anime cutscenes.\n* *Xenosaga* started the trend of every game going forward having swimsuit outfit options, with it definitely being an in-game model with Episode III (earlier games have the items, just not sure about the visuals)\n* Several of XC1's outfits were quite... revealing, though they toned one or two back with the Definitive Edition. Seven's \"Speed\" body gear being the most notable example.\n\nSo while XC2 is probably the best known for it (mostly because it showed up more often), the elements were always present.",
            "I feel like generally the line is at were the series usually goes, if it's something you could see in the game itself, it should prob be fair game for the sub, and Xeno can get pretty lewd."
