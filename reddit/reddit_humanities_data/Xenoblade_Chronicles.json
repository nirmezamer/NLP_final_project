However the game will have many references to Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2, and is considered a sequel as far as the story is concerned, so I recommend playing those first if you want to get the full experience.  \n  \n###\u2022 How many chapters are there in total?  \n  \n>!There are seven chapters total.!<\n  \n###\u2022 Why can't I equip accessories to Mwamba?  \n  \nJust keep playing the game. You'll unlock the ability to later.  \n  \n###\u2022 What does the Stalker class's \"Art Follow Up\" Field Buff do?  \n  \nWhen you use an art in the zone an additional projectile will be fired. The specifics of the damage, etc are unknown right now.  \n  \n###\u2022 Is there content that I can miss out on by progressing in the story?  \n  \nNo, you will always be able to go and do anything that you're afraid of missing.  \n  \n###\u2022 Why does it take me so long to level up my classes?  \n  \nThe amount of class XP you get seems to be based off of the CP earned from your fighting. Additionally, you won't gain any class XP from fighting something five or more levels below you.  \n  \n\n  \n------\n  \n## Use this thread to ask any question that doesn\u2019t warrant discussion, meaning questions that have one or two objectively correct answers.  \n  \n## Please try to word your question as spoiler free as possible. If your question cannot be asked without spoilers, use spoiler tags and mention what chapter of the game you are in.",

        "content": "Hey all. I'm just feeling out how the general community feels about this one: it's unlikely that the results of this poll will be acted on without further deliberation. But given the notable upsurge in fanart and the related increase in people complaining about borderline nsfw fanart, I was curious which side the majority of people sided with. I try to avoid acting for the vocal minority, so this poll will help influence the mod team's choices going forward. If you have other suggestions or thoughts, I'll be happy to read about them in the comments.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1czkju0)",

            "Banning or restricting PG-13 fanart seems like a recipe for causing activity on this sub to bottom out.  There's not a whole lot in the way of Xenoblade news to talk about right now.",
            "So IMO (As in my opinion) the NSFW is really not that bad here. And as long as you mark it as 18+, i dont think there should be a problem since you can just hide 18+ content.",
            "I mean, we have a NSFW tag for a reason right? As long as its not straight up porn all the time, what does it matter the fan art being posted? Its the people's fault for not having NSFW photos hidden if its causing problems for them while in public. And if they dont like the posts, they can just, you know, keep scrolling? Ignore the post and move on with their day?",
            "Most people here are fine with how art has always been handled here. We shouldn't have to change it because a small contingent of people are constantly annoying about it in the comments. The upvotes speak for themselves. Xenoblade 3 is old news now, and it isn't even as popular as Xenoblade 2 which is even older than that. There's really not many things to post about other than art, speculation, and memes or something. Most people here have played the games already and most discussion about the stories or whatever have been covered already. Just let it be until the next game is announced.",
            "I think people need to just understand that this is how series specific subs tend to go. When there isn't any actively new content happening for the series, you end up with a lot of art and other non-game related posting. God, just look at the state of something like r/danganronpa. Things could always be worse. The point is that if people are posting art to keep the sub afloat until there's something of actual worth to talk about again, then I say let people post art. What's the alternative? People are complaining about the presence of art, but it's not like those people are gonna take over for the art posters and start posting other stuff themselves. \n\nPeople are asking for the alternative to art to be literally nothing, and that's stupid.",
            "I feel like generally the line is at were the series usually goes, if it's something you could see in the game itself, it should prob be fair game for the sub, and Xeno can get pretty lewd.",
            "Seriously? people are afraid of art now? This is one of the rare franchise that keep getting new art everyday despite having like 1 game every 6 years and you want to suppress it",
            "I love the art people post here all the time because I don\u2019t like using twitter and this a great community for it. \n\nIt\u2019s a clear vocal minority who is acting off. Please don\u2019t cave.",
            "Yea i think the fanarts should all be ok aslong as theyre not 18+. And even if its 18+, it can be hidden. Fanart is awesome and shouldnt be forbidden just because of some lewd pictures",
            "I think lewd art is ok, but should be limited to people that already are members of the community, many people here just post nfw to farm karma"
