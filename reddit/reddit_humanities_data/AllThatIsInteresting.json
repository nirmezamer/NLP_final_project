The judge then credited Barber with the two days he spent in jail after his arrest and he went home that day. Barber also only had to register as sex offender for 10 years under the judge\u2019s ruling, and despite being on probation is free to travel with the court\u2019s approval, which he has received multiple times in the last few years, according to court records.\n\nNo wonder she feels she has to sue to get any justice.",

Used to go on hikes and would see these guys running up in full pack said it was like he was standing still they were moving so fast. \n\nI don't think people understand how badass Hotshots are and wilderness firefighters are. I truly admire the work they do. I wanted to get into it before I got diagnosed with UC when I was 21.",

Though I didn't actually read it until my early 20's, I would look at the picture section and had some basic understanding of the story. What always fascinated me was how this little elf character was thought to be so charasmatic that a whole lot of people thought that he was Jesus\nChrist. The lazy answer is \"drugs,\" but that really doesn't explain very much at all.\n\nDefinitely recommend Helter Skelter. I found it disturbing to the point that it made me nauseas at times. Written by the prosecutor of the case, Vincent Bugliose, so it is highly detailed as to evidence, dates, times, and things like that.",
