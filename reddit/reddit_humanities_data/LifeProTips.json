Many people map out plans to maximize points and use it for hotel stays, flights, holidays in general or credit against your statement\n\n- Credit Score, cannot be understated and is probably the best part (for me as a peasant) using a credit card. If you can pay off on time, in full, never borrowing you do not pay interest at all. Don't spend more than you can afford and you will build your credit score. Paying with your bank card does not have the same effect, in fact none at all since you're not borrowing. Great for mortgages or loans if needed in future (better rates since you're lower risk)\n\nThis LPT was prompted because I saw many people complaining that their bank won't chargeback fraud transactions.\n\nNobody ever told me this. In fact when I was young the notion was to avoid credit.",
