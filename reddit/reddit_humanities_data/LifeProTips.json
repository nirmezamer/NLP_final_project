It SUCKS!\n\nI don\u2019t use 90% of the features available. Why do I need to remotely turn on my microwave?!

It's also often plain harder to use and virtually anything that connects to the internet or requires an app is almost certainly collecting data on you needlessly, but also creates more surface area for hackers.\n\n\nI love my bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. I don't want to have to trobleshoot my blootooth connection to make coffee.\n\n\nSamsung doesn't need to know what's in my fridge.\n\n\nAmazon doesn't need to know whats happening in my bedroom.\n\n\nI don't want to replace my toaster because the touchscreen died.\n\n\nJust because its newer doesn't mean its better.\n\n\nSometimes a thing just needs to be a heating element and a switch in a housing.",

The added benefit is you get some exercise as well.\n\nI know it's not easy for some to just sign up for activities and go meet new people, but the juice is worth the squeeze.
