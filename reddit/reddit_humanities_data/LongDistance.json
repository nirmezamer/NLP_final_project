It wasn\u2019t easy\u2026 I started small\u2026 setting aside a little bit from each paycheck\u2026 cutting down on expenses\u2026 skipping some nights out with friends. I took on extra shifts\u2026 sold a few things I didn\u2019t need\u2026 and picked up a side gig here and there. Every dollar I saved brought me closer to our reunion\u2026 it felt like forever\u2026 but I kept my eye on the prize.  \n  \nTo my surprise, I won an extra $1k online! That win helped push me over the $5,000 mark.  \n  \nNow\u2026 with my savings and a little bit of luck\u2026 I\u2019m booking my trip. I can\u2019t wait to see my other half\u2026 to hug them\u2026 and share all these stories. It\u2019s been a long road\u2026 but totally worth it. If you\u2019re in a similar boat\u2026 keep pushing\u2026 because the reunion is going to be amazing. Safe travels to all!  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n",
