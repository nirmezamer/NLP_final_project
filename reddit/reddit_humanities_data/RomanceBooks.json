            "CAUTION:\u00a0 Scenes contain some slightly NSFW material.\n\n{Double Crossed by Adora Crooks} is a romantic suspense story with an established m/f couple (Jack & Kennedy) that turns into a menage when Gabe ends up in their bed. Both MMCs are former SEALs working off-the-books for the government, the trio eventually ends up on the run together due to plot reasons. Jack is grumpy and intense, and Gabe is a hilarious Golden Retriever who loves to push his buttons. I absolutely adored Gabe, in addition to his sunny personality, he was filled with hidden depth. I thought the following scene was both funny and sweet:\n\nI slip into the bathroom and close\u00a0the door behind me.\u00a0I didn't grow up religious, but somewhere around my first tour in Iraq, I picked up the habit of praying every night.\u00a0It\u2019s a private experience, and something I\u2019m not ready to share with the two lovebugs in bed just yet.\u00a0I get on my knees on the worn-out bath rug, rest my elbows on the edge of the tub, and clasp my hands together, bowing my head.\n\n\u201cAre you there, God? It\u2019s me again, your idiot son. I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve this, but thank you for the amazing sex. And these two beautiful humans. Like, seriously, they might be your hottest creations, so. Well done, you. Please take care of them. And, if the three of us bang again, well. I might just actually go to church. Okay. That\u2019s it. Forever and ever, amen.\u201d\n\nYeah. Dope prayer.\n\nI squeeze my palms together, then unlace my fingers. With that, I go back to bed and climb under the covers with Kennedy and Jack  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater in the story, the three of them show up unannounced in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner at Kennedy's parent's house. Kennedy's upper crust family is very proper, she is the black sheep.  She has a prickly relationship with her sister Rebecca, and their interaction, combined with the stress of the previous week, causes Kennedy to lose her cool like never before. I laughed as Gabe attempted to smooth things over:\r  \n\r  \nRebecca makes a noise that almost sounds like a whimper of glee. \u201cThat\u2019s typical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she says. \u201cI said this would happen\u2014Daddy, didn\u2019t I say it? You can never pick one thing and stick to it. Always changing direction halfway through.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\"That has nothing to do with this!\u201d Kennedy snaps.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh? Really? I knew you\u2019d drop out of law school. You can\u2019t finish anything you start!\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSays the woman who\u2019s never accomplished anything except pushing two babies out.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nRebecca\u2019s face goes crimson. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about accomplishments. I was valedictorian. I won first place in all of my barrel racing competitions. I was the prom queen and the class president. I married my high school boyfriend. Happily.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve taken two dicks at once,\u201d Kennedy snarls, \u201cever do that?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe table goes silent.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFuck this,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry anyway.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nKennedy gets up from the table, slaps her napkin down, and rushes into the kitchen.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s a vacuum of silence when Kennedy leaves. \n\nI clear my throat. \u201cTo be clear. She was talking about our dicks. It\u2019s not like\u2026getting gangbanged by two strangers. It was very loving, actually\u2014\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJack narrows his eyes at me. \u201cStop talking.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI shut up.\r  \n\r  \nThe silverware beside me rattles. Granny leans forward, her wiry hands clasped together.\r  \n\u201cSo,\u201d she says, \u201ctwo at once. How does that work, exactly?\u201d    \ud83d\ude02",

The salary was amazing, benefits \ud83e\udd0c, free travelling, and everything you can imagine from the post.\n\nShe was so eager and excited she was texting me on the side while reading the terms.\n\nUntil, she reached the middle of it. Then, the requirements started to shift from professional to physical. She stopped to check if she read that right or misunderstood. Then, she asked the guy who contacted her. And he told her, that if she signs the contract that she will be required to work professionally during the office hours and meet his physical needs after that. She will be paid for both. Oh! And she haven't met the CEO at this point. She'll only meet him once she sings the contract.\n\nShe was stunned. She said no, he tried to talk her into it and she threatened to call the police and walked out of there. He tried to contact her again but she blocked him.\n\nMy contemporary reader brain is thoroughly entertained and literally exploding after talking to her. I told her, this happens all the time in the books, but I never heard it happen IRL.
