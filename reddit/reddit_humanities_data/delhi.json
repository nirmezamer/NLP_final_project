And it\u2019s quite well written 200 something pages book, easy to understand for laypeople.",

Life got busy, and I never got it checked out.\n\nFast forward to recently, with the warranty almost up, I finally took it to the Apple service center in Saket. They updated the software, but the battery drain wouldn't quit. After some testing, they determined there was a bigger issue and - plot twist! - offered to replace it with a brand new iPad!\n\nNow I'm rocking a fresh iPad with a full warranty until next year.  Fingers crossed the battery issue stays away, but hey, if not, there's always next year (assuming Apple's policy covers it).\n\nAnyone else have any experience with Apple's service centers?",
