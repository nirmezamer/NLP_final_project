We're glad you're here to chat about Roblox games and experiences, and we hope you have a good time.\n\nWe, the mods at /r/Roblox request that all help questions be posted here. This is because we get a lot of users who are seeking help, and after the shut down of the Roblox forums, this may be the best place to ask questions.\n\nHowever, we would like to remind you that /r/Roblox is an unofficial fan subreddit, that is maintained by volunteer mods who do not work for Roblox Corp.  We cannot assist with account issues, and anyone who says they can is likely a scammer.\n\n[We strongly advise checking our FAQ,](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/wiki/faq) as it lists a bunch of commonly asked questions such as:\n\n* What to do if you think your account is hacked\n* What to do if some Robux appears/disappears from your account\n* How to tell if something is a scam\n* For parents: how to enable Parental controls and other tools available to you\n\nIf you have a solution to a common question that you think should be added to the FAQ, please message the mods.\n\nIf your question hasn't been answered by the FAQ, please post below. **While you're waiting for a reply, please check out other questions by other users and see if you are able to answer their questions.

            "Ok so there is this game I remember playing years ago, it was a rp game, and I don\u2019t remember much but I remember some about it. I remember it had jobs, and to get the job you had to go in a blue circle, I know one of the jobs was criminal, if someone could remind me what the game is that would be great",
            "I play Roblox on Xbox but I haven't played in a while. When I came back to it today I saw that the settings category in the menu has completely changed. It now has options like \"automatic chat translation\" and \"chat translation language\" and other chat related options. This confused me because I thought there was no chat on console, and I still can't see any option in-game to open or view the chat. Basically my question is how do you use the chat?",

            "Can somebody answer this for me. So I say in chat for a game \u201ccry about it\u201d (quite literally everybody says that to me) and I get smashed by the ban hammer for 3 days. But when people literally cuss at me in vc and I report them they don\u2019t get banned. Roblox needs to step up",
            "I have a bug in Roblox (Mobile) where when I press the menu button (Top left button next to the 'chat'), the buttons don't show up (Leave, Reset character, Volume settings, Graphic settings, the whole shebang) and only shows a gray transparent overlay instead. Though the bug doesn't show up in all my playthroughs, it's still very annoying and can ruin my overall experience, because I can't turn off my performance stats or change my general settings.\n\nIt would be very helpful if I do resolve this problem because the thought of experience this forever on all my playthroughs is somewhat spine chilling. Thanks in advance!\n\n(PS, I've found something out while making this post. I checked Roblox again to be sure, and the bug is actually consistent every time I play a game. What it does is during the first time I open the menu, it works fine. Though after the first, it just doesn't show up and registers blank)",

When I checked my Mobile Phone Number balance I didn't got charge for it, I checked my Apple purchases services and it's in there said pending. will my two account will get banned for it? should I wait for them to just charge me?
