        "content": "I figured you guys would enjoy such a story for the luls\n\nI am a student pilot, training for my PPL and on my checkride before my first solo, I smashed the plane against the runway\n\nI fly a Petrel 912i which is an argentinian aircraft (a cheap version of a 152 basically) and its flaps lever is like a handbrake in the center (important detail). The story is as so:\n\nIt had stormed for a whole week and the academy is on a dirt runway. Due to the mud, only 1/3rd of the runway was available. It is a very long runway when 100% and it wasn't very short at 1/3rd either but regardless, I had to land super slow with 3pts of flaps and brake as soon as possible. \n\nAnyways, I land with 3pts of flaps with idle power and touch almost at the start of the runway and in the center but I was too fast and bounced back up. As soon as I feel myself back in the air, I communicate that I am aborting the landing and push full power and at the same time, I push right rudder. \n\nHere is where shit happens lol, my brain switch to car mode and I thought I was releasing clutch and pushing throttle........and removed the \"handbrake\"\n\nthe plane fell like a meter from the air and HARD, my instructor was pale white and yelling \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING\" and after smashing, I immediately get airbone again (full throttle from before) and I was terrified to look at my instructor in the eye lmao\n\nSo I get back into the circuit, got my ass handed to me, land properly, and when we park at the hangar, the next student was there waiting. \n\nI was silent with a blank stare and my instructor told her \"check the landing gear thoroughly\"  She asked \"what did you do???\" and he jokingly says \"don't ask\". A few seconds later, she turns around (she was heading to do the preflight check) and yells \"it better be dead!\"\n\nMy instructor and me had a good laugh of it. Of course I failed and was denied the solo but luckily we both walked away and there was no substantial damage done\n\nso yeah, don't release all 3 points of flaps dangerously slow and low lol",

            "this is actually my landing technique",
            "This one time my instructor and I were practicing engine out procedures and I had my landing spot picked out but I wasn't going to make it in the current configuration so I dumped a notch of flaps to increase my glide distance and my instructor was like \"huh, I've never seen someone do that before, but it worked! Typically you just keep the flaps full once they are put in.\"",
            "In one of the 172's I fly the spring loaded flap lever is broken, so there's no spring and it just clicks up, off, down. Super hot day, very high DA, During a touch and go I hit the flaps up and instead of neutral I accidentally pushed them down and had full flaps about 100 AGL after takeoff and started dropping like a rock until I got the nose back down and realized flaps were back down.\n\nSuper unnerving that close to the ground when not expecting it at about 9k DA in an old 172. Got that awful sinking feeling in my stomach for a moment lol. Luckily I did not hit the ground, but I quadruple check the flap lever in that specific plane now.",
            "I've done it too, during my PPL training, solo flight, did either a touch and go or a go-around and went from full flaps to zero when I was like 100ft AGL. Plane dropped a good 20 ft and I puckered so hard a diamond came out of my ass. Quickly learned to never make that mistake again - if you're airborne, don't work up flaps until you have speed and altitude.",
            "Que boludo! \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7",
            "yeah, do some go-arounds on your couch:\n\npower, altitude, 1 notch of flaps\n\npower, altitude, 1 notch of flaps\n\npower, altitude, 1 notch of flaps\n\npower, altitude, 1 notch of flaps\n\nover and over until it becomes muscle memory.\n\nYou can also do spin training the same way --\n\npower off, ailerons neutral, opposite rudder, elevator nose down\n\npower off, ailerons neutral, opposite rudder, elevator nose down\n\npower off, ailerons neutral, opposite rudder, elevator nose down\n\npower off, ailerons neutral, opposite rudder, elevator nose down\n\nuntil it takes less than a second for it to kick in",
            "Had a similar experience a few days ago. Came in for a landing with two notches of flap and started balooning a bit due to excess airspeed. Decided to go around and put in full throttle. Was about to reduce one notch of flap but dumped them all at once accidentally. Dropped about a 100 feet all of a sudden but was luckily high enough to recover without incident.\n\nIf we were any lower, would have slammed into the ground and crashed. Saw firsthand the effectiveness of flaps and learnt a lesson I'll never forget.",
            "i thought the mantra was \"any good landing you can walk away from, and any great landing you can use the plane again\"",

            "Whether or not they ask for it comes down to...well, whether or not they ask for it. \n\nSome applications specifically call out 141 stage checks, but not all. Some will ask if you've failed *any* checking event. Read the questions carefully. \n\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of disclosing it. \n\nFailing a stage check nearly 20 years ago is a nothing burger.",
            "They might not find it, but if they do you\u2019ll lose a potential job over something they most likely don\u2019t care about anyway other than the honesty aspect. This is if they ask about training failures and not checkrides specifically.",
            "Just tell them and say you have no record of it. They won\u2019t care. If you fail to report it and they find out you knew that\u2019s far worse",
            "During my piedmont Interview they asked if I had any stage check fails and I honestly can\u2019t remember because its nowhere near as significant as a checkride but if they wanted the records I could rummage through the schools basement to find out.",
            "They probably couldn\u2019t care less if you report it. But they\u2019ll care a lot more if you  don\u2019t and they find out.   It will be a good talking point for 30 seconds in the interview where you can turn it into a learning experience and then that will be that.",
            "Stage checks don\u2019t go anywhere on your record except your school\u2019s. It\u2019s not part of the federal database. Only official checkride are. And if the school no longer has those records? Oh well.",
            "You can find your PRIA on the faa website somewhere and check",
            "If they don't ask about it and you didn't put it on anything oh well. If you don't put anything on your app and they find out expect to be blacklisted and have your cjo revoked. Why risk it? Have a humble reason for the failure and explain what you learned from it. Alot of pilots have at least one failure anyways.",
            "There is no need to guess. Submit for a copy of your PRD/PRIA records. The only things you need to disclose training wise are the things that show up on there. The only things any employer cares about are what verifiable records you have. After you making a smoking hole in the ground with one of their airplanes and the courts and media dig up your information. They don't want to be blindsided by your past. So again, they really only care what is actually on your record.",
            "They're not going to care, but answer the question you are asked. Some airlines ask for \"any training failures\". Some just ask for checkride failures. \n\nWhether or not to disclose something in aviation never comes down to whether or not you think someone can find out the truth some other way. Always just answer the question you are asked truthfully. You may or may not be asked to disclose it. That should be what determines whether or not you do."
