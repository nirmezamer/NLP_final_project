        "content": "Wow, the last 3 years have been amazing. Many of us are still in disbelief it was even happening the way it did. Let\u2019s go over a few of the new/old expectations. \n\n1. 1500 hours is not longer the gateway to getting that sweet CRJ/ERJ job. It\u2019s mostly just the FAA minimum and companies are now (probably) going to require more time.\n\n2. Yes, take the job flying the twin or jet. Turbine and multi time will probably soon become standard resume basic requirements to be on top again.\n\n3. Go after those resume hot ticket items: PIC, PIC Turbine, Check Airman, OE Captain, Chief Pilot, Director of Operations, Assistant Chief Pilot etc.\n\n4. Never be above pushing a broom. A little humility in the attitude can go a very long way.\n\n5. Keep those friends and contacts up to date. Some of the best jobs you\u2019ll have will come from someone remembering your name.\n\n6. College degrees are probably going to be a requirement again soon. Probably. It\u2019s silly.\n\n7. Contracts. Well, they\u2019re not new and the ones you\u2019re looking at now are quite good compared to the last decade. I\u2019m not advocating that you sign them, but think very hard about where you are in your career. Someone who signed that Republic contract has almost 2 years flying the EMB-175 at a 121 airline while the person who didn\u2019t might be flying a Citation CJ 2 as an SIC for a part 135/91 company while both are still wanting to fly for a legacy airline. One of those candidates has a better chance. Weigh your options. \n\n8. GO HAVE FUN! We all (most) got into this because we have a passion for flying airplanes. Sure, it may not be the big jet but, the point was to get paid to fly. \n\nDid I forget anything?",

            "Patience. To those that made into that sweet RJ job, enjoy it. You're still getting paid to fly. Decent and livable money too. You're seeing some of the best places America has to offer. You what overnight isn't at fun as you'd think it is? Orlando. Downtown MCO is no more fun than downtown Phoenix or Houston. Stay by the parks and it's a giant tourist trap that charges twice as much for literal meals at Applebees and has kids screaming up and down the hall all evening. A lot of big city downtowns have little to offer over some medium sized city that are often full of charm. You know what is an awesome downtown? Des Moines. Huntsville. Moline. Augusta. Bloomington. Enjoy your free breakfasts you won't be getting them at a legacy (sure you'll get fed on the plane though), $2 beers and low cost of living overnights. Because Las Vegas is gonna 5x the price. Enjoy flying with people your own age because when you come to a Legacy, you're gonna be hanging out with a bunch of 62 year old curmudgeons. Youll very rarely interact with the FAs. Youll have little camaraderie. You'll get here eventually. You will. But understand that the folks who flew CRJ for nine months and then got a widebody job at United are the exception of the rule. Going to a regional for 4-7 years isn't a bad deal.",
            "To add to this, this isn\u2019t the beginning of a new dark decade, it\u2019s not even close, this is a merely a blip on the radar as things just settle in. Every legacy airline will continue to retire 300-500 or more pilots per year, it\u2019s inevitable, people can\u2019t stop time and aging.",
            ">College degrees are probably going to be a requirement again soon. Probably. It\u2019s silly.\n\nIt's also a really good idea to have in your back pocket in case something happens to your ability to hold a medical certificate.",
            "As a retired legacy pilot I have watched the goldrush characteristics of the past few years with chagrin. The cyclic nature of aviation careers is historically wicked. I started in meager times and although I pushed hard luck was probably crucial. But what kept me pushing wasn't dreams of free days and bags of money.  The last tip from OP is crucial to continue, because you want to have a job flying, for the love of flying.",
            "Is PIC turbine better than PIC multi(piston)? I notice many 135 jobs require multi but not turbine. Thoughts? There are many jobs requiring both, but for those of us approaching 1500 I notice for applicable jobs Multi might be better.",

Apparently, airport ops asked the tower controller if they could reach the SWA flight when the tower opened and claimed the flight flew over them. \n\nIt seems like there were quite a few threats here: runway closures, non-towered airport ops, and a very early start time. \n\nHave you ever caught some big \u201cgotchas\u201d when flying in/out of non-towered airports?

            "I get that the NOTAM system is bad. The real issue here is SWA not following established procedures at a non-towered airport. A single broadcast on the CTAF would have alerted them to the closed runway.",

            "My guess:\n\nA fatigued flight crew running on 5.2 hours of quality sleep and excess caffeine due to an aggressive work schedule missed the NOTAM. It\u2019s a shame companies refuse to acknowledge that fatigue costs them money too.",
            "NOTAM system sucks, yes. As a regional CA I had a couple experiences missing important ones and that was all I needed to take as much time as I need on each flight to go over them thoroughly. Occasionally when other stuff is going on that means we block out late, maybe 3 or 4 minutes later than if I just skimmed the NOTAMs. I\u2019ve never \u201cblamed\u201d a late departure on reading NOTAMs but maybe I should start. If a bunch of us did it they\u2019d fix the system.",
            "The airport I fly medevac out of is doing construction along the sides of the larger runway and only had the larger one notam'd closed. Turns out they decided to \"close\" the smaller one too and start working on that one while driving across it haphazardly but they didn't put X's up and \"forgot\" to issue the NOTAM as well. I put forgot in quotations because it is an unacceptable mistake in my opinion. Crews had no radios. Potential accident was waiting to happen for sure. Whether it was debris left on the runway or some clown speeding across it in a truck without looking both ways. Of course the NOTAM then goes out at 8:46 when I called asking what was going on instead of a more normal time like 7:30 or whatever. Later when I called the foreman to get it back opened up for my return flight (manager gave us prior permission for med flights) he was asking me if I knew why there was a helicopter doing touch and goes on the \"closed runway\". I had to explain this is why putting NOTAMs out sufficiently early before people take off is important and also visual markers depicting that it is in fact closed....",
            "Why can't ground-based NOTAMs be reflected on taxiway diagrams generated by ForeFlight? Like if TWY G, RWY 18/36 are closed, there should be an overlay that shows them in red or with big X's.\n\nNot to say that missing the NOTAM is excusable, and not saying that NOTAMs should be replaced by this, but it seems like a very easy thing to implement. Basic human factors.",
            "Busted out on short final to see the runway covered with cop cars and cones. Training day for the department but no one bothered to tell anybody they were taking over an active airport runway on a low ceiling day.  That was a fun conversation with ATC.",

            "I did the 530 flight out of PWM multiple times this month. The automated weather does have the runway on it advertised as closed.  There\u2019s maybe 4-5 jets that leave before the tower opens. Republic with a delta and United and a few others. They all talk on the CTAF on the way to the opened runways. Not sure how SWA fucked up this badly."

I typically as a line holder end up with 18 days off.  I then trade the existing trips I have for as high of pay as possible.  Typically can credit 10-25 more just by trading for more efficient trips without adding days of work. That obviously means I fly more on those days I am working with short overnights.
