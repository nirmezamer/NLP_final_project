        "content": "This is literally everything you need to hack your Vita and PS TV in nice, simple, step-by-step directions. I had a hard time figuring all of this out after watching a bunch of tutorials so I thought I'd share what I learned.\n\nUPDATE: After downloading H-Encore 2 and Vita Shell, the first thing you should download is the Modoru vpk. Then downgrade to 3 60 or 3.65 firmware and then install Enso vpk to keep your Vita on 3.60 or 3.65 firmware permanently. This is very important. It will make all of the apps much more compatible since every app works on 3.60 and 3.65. \n\nAlright here we go!\n\n\nOn PC:\n\nDownload H-Encore 2 on github.com\n\nDownload FinalHE on github\n\nDownload Autoplugin for Vita on github\n\nSave all of these downloads on an external device in a folder. Name it PS Vita Hacking\n\nDownload Content Manager Assistant\u00a0from Sony. Google it and download it. \n\nStart FinalHe\n\nHook up PS Vita to PC\n\nCopy content from FinalHE to PS Vita through Content Manager on your Vita\n\nThis should install H-encore 2\n\nStart H-encore 2 app from Vita's home screen\n\nDownload Vita Shell from H-Encore 2 app. \n\nInstall Henkaku on H-Encore 2\n\nCopy Autoplugin over from PC to uX0: in Vita Shell app.\u00a0\n\nStart Autoplugin\n\nDownload NoDpDRM and Repatch from Autoplugin app\n\nCreate a RePatch folder in Vita Shell in uX0:\n\nDownload the game you want on your PC. \n\nOnce the download is finished, open the app folder on PC and copy it's contents (PCS####) over to the apps folder on your Vita in Vita Shell, uX0:, apps. \n\nIf there is an English patch file, copy the RePatch folder contents of the game from your PC to the RePatch folder on your Vita in Vita Shell, Ux0, RePatch\n\nThen in Vita Shell, press Triangle on your Vita and then click Refresh Live.\u00a0\n\nDO NOT UPDATE VITA\n\nIf an update comes out, go to Henkaku settings and select \"Spoof firmware\" and then select it as the then current firmware.\u00a0\n\nStart H-Encore 2 every time you want to access Vita Shell and any other hacked app.\u00a0\n\nDone. \n\n\n\nAdd-On Content/DLC:\n\nCreate an \"addcont\" folder in Ux0:\n\nPut the addcont folder contents from the game file on your PC into the addcont folder on your Vita in Ux0:\n\nPut the license folder contents from the game on your PC into the license folder on your Vita in Ux0:\n\nPut the patch folder contents from the game on your PC into the patch folder on your Vita in Ux0:\n\nDone.\n\n\n\nSD2Vita:\n\nFormat micro sd card\n\nGo on Vita\n\nClick on the Autoplugin app.\u00a0\n\nSelect install SD2Vita plugin.\n\nOpen Vita Shell on Vita.\n\nPress start on Vita in Vita Shell and change the primary memory card to SD2Vita under Ux0:. Your Vita memory stick should be under maO:\u00a0\n\nIMPORTANT: If you take the SD2Vita out and put a physical PS Vita cartridge in your Vita, make sure you put the game in after you start your Vita. If you start the Vita with game already in the game slot, the Vita may ask for you to format your memory card. If this happens, don't format. Instead, select no and then turn off PS Vita and take out the game cartridge. Then turn it back on, get to the home screen, and then put in the game cartridge.\n\nDone. \n\n\n\nDowngrading Firmware and Installing Enso:\n\nOn PC, download the latest version of Modoru on github.\n\nFind and download Vita Firmware 3.65. Google it and then download it. It should be a PSP2UPDAT.PUP file. \n\nDownload latest version of Enso on github\n\nOn Vita, open H-encore 2 and then exit.\n\nConnect PC to PS Vita using Vita Shell.\n\nCopy Modoru vpk over to Vita, uX0:, data.\n\nInstall Modoru by selecting Modoru vpk in Vita Shell, uX0:, data and then selecting \"install\". Then delete Modoru vpk in the data folder. Make sure you delete Modoru vpk once the app is added to home screen, otherwise this will not work.\u00a0\n\nUnder apps in Vita Shell, find Modoru folder.\n\nWith Vita Shell opened, on PC, copy over contents of PS Vita 3.65 firmware folder (PSP2UPDAT.PUP file) over to uX0:, apps, Modoru folder.\u00a0\n\nCopy PSP2UPDAT.PUP over to uX0:, data in Vita Shell.\u00a0\n\nOn PC, copy over Enso.vpk to uX0: in Vita Shell.\u00a0\n\nInstall Enso by clicking the Enso vpk and then select \"install\" in Vita Shell.\u00a0\n\nOpen H-encore 2 on Vita and select \"reset Tai-hen\"\n\nOpen up Vita Shell again and navigate to uX0: and find the tai folder.\u00a0\n\nRename tai folder to \"tail\". The tai folder plugins must not be active in order for Modoru to work.\u00a0\n\nThen reset Vita.\n\nOnce it resets, open H-encore 2 and exit.\n\nFind the Modoru app on Vita homescreen and open it.\u00a0\n\nFollow the directions in Modoru app and make sure it will install Vita firmware 3.65.\n\nOnce it is finished, your Vita will restart.\n\nOnce it boots back up, open up H-encore 2 and then exit.\n\nThen open up Enso app and follow the directions to permanently hack your Vita to 3.65 firmware.\n\nOnce Enso is installed, you won't need H-encore 2 anymore.\u00a0\n\nOpen up Vita Shell and find the \"tail\" folder in uX0: and rename it back to \"tai\".\n\nThen exit Vita Shell and open Auto Plugin app on Vita homescreen and install whatever plugins you want. The most important plugins are NoNpDRM, rePatch, and ReFOOD.\n\nYour Vita is permanently hacked and good to go!\u00a0Done. \n\nOther Notes: For Higher Firmwares:\u00a0\n\nIf triangle crashes Vita Shell, then press \"start\" first in Vita Shell and click \"Restart Vita Shell\" and then try clicking triangle to refresh area.\u00a0\n\nNever ever delete PCS9006. This is the file for the H-Encore 2.\u00a0\n\nNote: If you want to simply apply English patches to Japanese game cartidges you already own, avoid placing the downloaded game's app folder contents since the app folder will be the actual game cartridge once you put it in your Vita.\n\nFor PS TV:\nAll the steps are the same, except you need to connect to your PC through wifi first in the Content Manager to transfer over H-encore 2. \n\nThen the rest of your connections to PC will be in Vita Shell through FTP connection, using FileZilla on PC or any similar PC application.  \n\nPS TV: If you don't know how to use FTP connection:\n\nFirst, make sure your PS Vita is on the most current firmware. \n\nGo on your PC and start FinalHE.  Connect to your PC using Content Manager on Vita and transfer over H-encore 2 to your PS Vita. \n\nOnce H-encore 2 is installed, open H-encore 2 app on Vita and then install Henkaku and download Vita Shell in H-encore 2. Then exit.\n\nOpen up Vita Shell and place the Modoru vpk in the data folder in uX0:, data. Then place the 3.65 firmware file (PSP2UPDAT.PUP) in the same data folder. \n\nInstall Modoru through Vita Shell and then delete the Modoru vpk in data once the Modoru app is on your home screen. \n\nCopy the PSP2UPDAT.PUP file from the data folder to the Modoru folder in uX0:, apps, Modoru. \n\nPlace Enso vpk on the root of your PS Vita memory card. Do not start Modoru or Enso yet though.\n\nPlace Auto Plugin vpk on the root of your PS Vita memory card. \n\nTake your memory card out of your PS Vita (when it is off) and insert it into your PS TV and follow the steps to install Modoru and then once your PS TV reboots itself, start Enso and permanently hack your PS TV on firmware 3.65. \n\nStart Auto Plugin on PS TV home screen and install NoNpDRM, rePatch, and reFOOD plugins. \n\nDone. \n\nNote: This will not work if your PS Vita memory card is from any firmware other than the most current on your PS Vita. It has to be the current firmware in order to use the memory card otherwise PS TV will ask you to format your memory card. Once you hack the PS TV to 3.65 and set up Enso, you can use the memory card between PS Vita and PS TV on 3.65 firmware. \n\nOnce you have your PS TV set up, then downgrade your Vita using Modoru and Enso. Vita is much easier to hack than PS TV imo.",

            "Thanks for this. Saving.  I need to jacks vita TV on 3.70 and connecting it to something was always a pain. All the guides just said to do the same thing as a vita but the options are different. \n\nAny suggestions on playing something like trails in the sky and doing any English patch? Or any guides you can recommend? Thats the next thing I need to do.",
            "Something that Im trying to figure for weeks now and I couldnt find a clear answer: my vita is on 3.61. Should I upgrade to 3.65 to make the jailbreak or there are better firmwares to my current system version?",
            "Not really relevant but, since the piracy argument came up in the comments, I wanted to say this guide is useful to those that bought the games too. Patch work with physical copies after all and repatch patches works mainly on the official psvita memory card. translation groups don't promote pirated games for their patches either.",

I'm trying to install Enso on my 3.60 now, and my question is do I have to do anything like factory reset my vita to get a clean start, or am ok just starting from where I'm at?",

You certainly can, and it's possible on a 3.60-3.73 Vita\n\n**Q: Can I downgrade my Vita?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes, with modoru.\n\n**Q: What's the best firmware to use?**\n\n\u2022\tA. The only differences are that 3.60 and 3.65 are Enso compatible, 3.68-3.73 is not. And that 3.60 has a much easier method to exploit it over 3.65 and 3.68 but also the webkit makes it easier to save you from troubles that can arise as we don\u2019t need a memorycard, psn access or a qcma. I highly recommend people to choose that one. Note that if you have a fat (OLED) Vita, you will need an official Sony memory card in order to use the 3.65 and 3.73 exploits as they require internal storage. If you\u2019re in 3.60 you can use mlthaku\n\n**Q: Can I play games with a firmware requirement higher than what my current firmware is?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes, you can, thanks to [0syscall6](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6).\n\n**Q: What games can I pirate?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Any game out there.\n\n**Q: What's the fastest way to play pirated games?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Upon getting your Vita, install the NoNpDRM plugin to the ux0:tai/config.txt or ur0:tai/config.txt (depending on if you are using SD2Vita or not), then install pkgj.\n\n**Q: What about PS1 and PSP games? Do those come in .vpk/.pkg files?**\n\n\u2022\tA. PS1 games can be converted into an eboot to be used with Adrenaline or can be left as .bin/.cue for use with Retroarch. PSP games need to be in .iso/.cso format to be used with Adrenaline. You can also see if they're available in pkgj\n\n**Q: I require assistance, can you help me?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes sure, but first read the faq, if your question is about a generic issue (plugins not working, hack installation, downgrade) check first the [troubleshooting guide](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/) and ask help in the [VitaPiracy discord](https://discord.gg/q3kfjRy) where people are available to personally help you. If you feel that your issue is not generic or complex, make a post about it. For exemple, \"nonpdrm is not working help\" shouldn't need a post. \"I haven't touched my Vita since 2009 what updates do I need\" are ok\n\n**Q: How do I install Adrenaline to play PSP/PS1/PSP homebrew?**\n\n\u2022\tA. [Here's the github for Adrenaline](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline/releases)\n\n**Q: Can I still play games I downloaded from PSN or use my cartridges?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes.\n\n**Q: How do I update my game?**\n\n\u2022\tA. With NoNpDRM dumps, you can use the Livearea to update your game. If you're using the anti-blacklist hack on your PSTV, you can download game updates with pkgj without having to disable the blacklist\n\n**Q: My PSTV isn't installing a Livearea update. How do I fix it?**\n\n\u2022\tA. If you have a antiblacklist hack installed, it may prevent installing for some games, but certainly does for games originally not allowed. Disable the antiblacklist hack to install the update.\n\n**Q: How do I know if a game update requires a certain firmware?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Use [VitaGameUpdateChecker](http://wololo.net/downloads/index.php/download/8356)\n\n**Q: What is NoNpDRM?**\n\n\u2022\tA. It's a plugin by TheFloW that lets you play encrypted, untampered Vita games. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm)\n\n**Q: What differences are there between Vitamin, NoNpDRM, and Maidump?**\n\n\u2022\tA. [See this chart](https://gist.github.com/TheRadziu/4d81d7882ebc5da339bc09a0bbe53f4b)\n\n**Q: What differences are there between 3.60 Enso, 3.65 Enso, and h-encore**\n\n\u2022\tA. [See this chart](https://gist.github.com/TheRadziu/4d81d7882ebc5da339bc09a0bbe53f4b)\n\n**Q: Can I transfer my saves if I'm still on Vitamin/Maidump dumps to be used with the NoNpDRM plugin?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes. savemgr is a useful tool to easily backup/restore your saves. Alternatively, you can backup your savedata folder in ux0:user/00/savedata.\n\n**Q: My dumps are currently Maidumps. Should I swap them out to play with the NoNpDRM plugin? How do I do that?**\n\n\u2022\tA. You'll be fine with sticking to Maidumps if you're updated to the latest version possible and used the method to prevent your saves being wiped after you resume your Vita from sleep (detailed in \"Q: I lost my savedata after I started my Vita up from suspend mode!...\"). To swap the dumps, you can either use savemgr or manually copy/paste the game's savefolder (ux0:user/00/savedata) to backup your saves before deleting the game in question to restore it after downloading and installing the NoNpDRM rip\n\n**Q: How do I rip/play games with NoNpDRM?**\n\n\u2022\tA. [Use this guide](https://pastebin.com/Yn7jt6B1)\n\n**Q: Where's NoPayStation and how do I use it?**\n\n\u2022\tA. You can find a bunch of links to games, the tool and a tutorial here\n\n**Q: How do I use pkgj (freeshop for the Vita) to download games right on to my Vita?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Making sure you have NoNpDRM working prior to this, get pkgj from [here](https://github.com/blastrock/pkgj/releases) and install it.\n\nOpen the app, and refresh (triangle to open the menu, then select refresh) and you will be able to select which game you want to install.\n\nNote: You can press L when a game is highlighted if you want to download its compatibility pack (0.31 pkgj or higher). You don\u2019t need that if you use ref00d/0syscall6\n\n**Q: I've installed pkgj, but it does not work. It says \"install failed\" when trying to download the game.**\n\n\u2022\tA1: Your NoNPDRM plugin might cause this issue. Check your config.txt and make sure the plugin is listed there correctly.\n\n\u2022\tA2: Try changing the plugin's path in ur0/ux0:tai to \"ur0:/tai/nonpdrm.skprx\" or \"ux0:/tai/nonpdrm.skprx\", wherever it's placed (It's best to keep all plugins in ur0: and keep a backup in ux0:).\n\n\u2022\tA3: There is an issue with size (you need to check it out on pkgj's github, I'm not sure) some people are experiencing.\n\n\u2022\tA4: If everything fails, [it may be that the zrif is invalid](https://github.com/mmozeiko/pkgi/issues/42). Use NPS browser on your PC instead (as a bonus you get access to PSP/PSX/PS3 titles and DLCs (including Vita DLCs)\n\n**Q: Can I delete my game, but backup my saves?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes, use [savemgr.](https://github.com/d3m3vilurr/vita-savemgr/releases)\n\n**Q: How do I mod NoNpDRM games?**\n\n\u2022\tA. To mod games, install [RePatch](https://github.com/dots-tb/rePatch-reDux0/releases) and treat ux0:repatch as ux0:app, then put your decrypted, modded files in the correct file path. [Follow these github instructions](https://github.com/d3m3vilurr/vita-savemgr/releases) for savemgr. For mods that require a modified eboot, [follow the tutorial for modified eboots](https://github.com/d3m3vilurr/vita-savemgr/releases)\n\n**Q: NPS browser is giving me \"PKG Decrypt Err!\" on everythin**g\n\n\u2022\tA: You are probably using pkg2zip parameters with pkg\\_dec. You should download pkg2zip and use it instead in order to use all of NPS browser's features.\n\n**Q: What else can I do with my Vita?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Some other things you can do are transfer files using a FTP client or direct transfer using Vitashell 1.60+, configure controls past the game's options, modifying game files (undubs, translations, graphical hacks, etc.), [playing PSP/PS1 games with native emulation](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline), use microSDcards as storage, or whitelisting your PSTV to play all games.\n\n**Q: Where do you find the \"refresh livearea\", \"mount uma0:\", and \"refresh license database\" options in Vitashell?**\n\n\u2022\tA: While viewing all partitions (ux0:, ur0:,...), press triangle.\n\n**Q: Can I play online, download, and update my games?**\n\n\u2022\tA: You can update your legitimate games regardless of your firmware. As far as online is concerned, PSN spoofing still works, so you can use the PSN store, sync trophies, play online, etc.\n\n**Q: I'm not going to bother with Playstation network services. Can I use a Vita without having an account?**\n\n\u2022\tA: Yes, you can set up a trial account when you set up your system.\n\n**Q: Can I use a USB as storage with my PSTV?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Yes. It needs to be formatted to FAT32 and you need to be using Vitashell 1.60 or later. For your first time using it, when viewing all partitions in Vitashell (ur0:, uma0:, etc), press triangle, mount the USB as uma0:, disconnect and connect the USB again if it asks you to, press triangle again, and mount it as ux0:. Making sure you have Enso installed, use usbmc\\_installer so that the USB will be mounted on boot every time.You can also either use storagemanager using the UMA option in the config (for exemple set UMA=ux0 in storagemgr\\_config.txt) in order to mount the USB storage as the memorycard at boot\n\n**Q: \"MicroSD cards as storage? How do I do it?\"**\n\n\u2022\tA: To use a microSD card on your Vita, You will an adapter that will need to take up your cartridge slot or one that will replace your 3G modem (only for the 3G Fat model). I am only aware of Yifanlu selling those type of adapters, but [here](http://gbatemp.net/threads/new-sd2vita-cartridge-from-china-available-on-taobao.483467/) is a thread for one of the latest SD2Vita designs. They've yet to ship, but there's a place to look. Check the other pinned message for other adapters. [Use this guide from cfw.guide](https://vita.hacks.guide/storagemgr) to use it.\n\n**Q: \"How do I upgrade from my memory card/internal storage to a SD2Vita?\"**\n\n\u2022\tA: Make sure you can view hidden folders and unhide protected operating system files in your Windows' folder options ([picture](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/439484919266148362/574687241939451956/unknown.png)), then back up all the files from your memory card and ur0:shell/db/app.db (which you can access by opening up a FTP server with Vitashell if your Vita's not in safe mode) so that your bubbles are in the same place. You can copy the entire memory card to your PC using Vitashell. After that, copy everything onto your microSD card (provided that you formatted your microSD card correctly as pointed out in the [Wololo tutorial.](http://wololo.net/2017/07/20/setting-sd2vita-adapter-formatting-microsd-can-done-windows/)\n\n**Q: How do I move to a bigger microSD card, say 128GB to 256GB?**\n\n\u2022\tA: It's the same deal as upgrading from an official memory card to your SD2Vita card, except you obviously don't need Vitashell to move files across the memory cards. Another thing to take into consideration is that you need to manually set the cluster size to 64kb since the size of the microsd is bigger we need to adjust it.\n\n**Q: Where do I put PSP/PS1 games?**\n\n\u2022\tA: PSP games go in ux0, ur0, or uma0:pspemu/iso/\\[isoname\\].iso. PS1 eboots go in ux0, ur0, or uma0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/\\[GAMEID\\]/EBOOT.PBP If you have put it on uma0: ur0: you need to change the memory stick path in adrenaline settings to ur0/uma0 (long press PS button to open the quick menu, then press settings button for adrenaline)\n\n**Q: \"Where can I get normal PSP ISOs and special modified ISOs (translations, etc.)?**\n\n\u2022\tA. You can use [Emuparadise with a workaround script](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/968sm6/a_script_for_easy_downloading_of_emuparadise_roms/) for normal ISOs and NextGenRoms for modified ISOs. There's also a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRtSppl9t_MRFWtPIIBJpCYRa5QqzvafFGWIK06gXpg/edit#gid=1476318644) that has some links still active ([backup to that spreadsheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Vud7MukKwPT0wbOGukFVmzxGYgDZX4fNgm2bLdPisk/edit?copiedFromTrash#gid=1476318644)\n\n**Q: How do I launch my PSP games from the Livearea just like a PS Vita game?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Use [AdrenalineBubbleManager](https://github.com/ONElua/AdrenalineBubbleManager)\n\n**Q: How do I install .vpks without needing double the space of it?**\n\n\u2022\tA. .vpks are basically renamed .zip files. Either rename them to a .zip for extraction or use an extraction program (I use 7-Zip) to extract the .vpk as-is. You can then install it as a folder in Vitashell\n\n**Q: I lost my savedata after I started my Vita up from suspend mode! What happened?**\n\n\u2022\tA: Vitamin and Maidumps required a work around for games to work, so their metadata gets messed up. Savedata can as a result disappear from these dumps. You can check ux0:user/00/savedata\\_backup and see if your save is there. To stop this from happening, create a folder in ux0:user/00/savedata and rename it to \"list.dat\".\n\n**Q: Will I get banned for playing online with pirated games, syncing trophies with pirated games, or using any PSN service with spoofing?**\n\n\u2022\tA: No, you won't. There haven't been any reports of bans as a result of any of these activities, but there have been unconfirmed ban reports of syncing trophies with a pre-release vpk of the US Criminal Girls and a developer build of Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom back in November-ish and September, respectively. Another case of temporary IP bans came as a result of the near app [excessively pinging Sony's servers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/64nnle/figured_out_why_people_are_getting_ip_banned_btw/) At this point, there's no chance of you getting banned.\n\n**Q: I've been told that the Vita has no games. Is this true?**\n\n\u2022\tA: If all you care about are exclusives, certain Vita publishers (Spike Chunsoft, Koei Tecmo, XSEED and NISA) have been porting their Vita titles to the PC, with the most recent being Valkyrie Drive and Danganronpa: Ultra Despair Girls. Some Vita ports (Virtua Tennis 4, Rayman Legends, and Dead or Alive 5+) have content exclusive to the system, which make them worthwhile to visit. [Gematsu has a very accurate list](http://gematsu.com/exclusives/ps-vita) of the status of the exclusives. Otherwise, the system has quite a few strong ports. It's weak in some genres, like racing games or first-person shooters, but is very strong in role-playing games and anime tie-ins, so your mileage will vary.\n\n**Q: Will oclockvita/VSHMenu damage my system?**\n\n\u2022\tA: No. Sony kept the system underclocked from it's maximum clock speeds. Oclockvita and VSHMenu only take the Vita's clock speeds to the maximum allowed by the Vita's SoC.\n\n**Q: Do I use Lolicon or PSVshell?**\n\n\u2022\tA: PSVshell should be what you need. It\u2019s a better lolicon version\n\n**Q: I have heard about or have experienced a savedata error which made me lose my savedata! What can I do to keep this from happening?**\n\n\u2022\tA: If you're using only NoNpDRM dumps, you will not have this issue. If you're using a Maidump, use [this method](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/54ecbu/save_issue_fix/) to keep it from happening again.\n\n**Q: I want to request a dump, translation, or save file. Do I just make a thread on that?**\n\n\u2022\tA: No, you need to use the correct thread underneath the subreddit info. Making a thread will result in the post being deleted and a warning.\n\n**Q: I need help with an emulator. Can I ask about my problem here?**\n\n\u2022\tA. Emulator discussion is better suited over at r/vitahacks.\n\n**Q: Can I post anything I create on Vita here?**\n\n\u2022\tA: We'll make an exemption to the rule here (yes, even with uncensored mods). If you think it'll better suit this subreddit instead of r/vitahacks or just want to cross post, go ahead. This subreddit has several thousand people subscribed to it and we don't want to deny community created creations that exposure. 99% of things will be allowed. You'd have to make something like a bricker vpk for it to be denied from this subreddit. If too much stuff gets posted, however, we'll dial this back and remove more lesser quality or less relevant creations. Lastly, try to post it when it's as finished as possible. ;)\n\n**Q: Can I post a thread asking for help with my creation?**\n\n\u2022\tA: Translation and mod threads are 100% acceptable here, but you need to know what you're doing and/or have at least some part of it done. You can also ask in r/vitahacks.\n\n**Q: What letters in the game's ID (ex. PCSA) go with what regions?**\n\n\u2022\tA: [Here's a guide for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/52py7z/help_you_find_your_downloaded_games_region/)",
