If anything, my nose pores seemed to be getting clogged more often and with more intensity than usual. I suspect that oil cleansing is the culprit. I'm emulsifying properly and using a water-based cleanser after, and my nose does feel much more clean and has less gunk when I go to bed after my night routine. However, the next morning the clogged pores return. I suspect the oil cleanser is either too stripping and dries my nose further or my pores are absorbing the oil? My left nostril is much more prone to getting acne than my right nostril, if that helps.\n\nShould I remove the oil cleanser from my routine? Or should I add/remove any other products. \n\nHere is a picture of my nose when waking up for reference:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oo7bqtzs8d9d1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=944f66addfcbdbc3f54bec82bd5d5ed3dacd1a86"

            "Skin type: Combination, Climate: Mediterranean, Skin tone: Fitzpatrick type II\n\nAllie Gel UV EX SPF50+ PA++++ : I bought this to be used as an outdoor sunscreen for the face. It has a gel texture, easy to apply. There is also a weird scent that goes away. Gives me an obvious white-cast, sting my eyes and leaves a slightly greasy finish. Will finish it up on my body when going for a run. For these reasons, I will not repurchase.\n\nAnessa Perfect UV Skin Care Milk SPF50+ PA++++ (2022 version) : Milky texture, easy to apply. The scent is baby powder which I don\u2019t mind. The finish is natural dewy for me, does not sting my eyes. It leaves a slightly visible white-cast on me upon first application which I can accept, but the white-cast intensifies when I reapply a few hours laters. For this reason, I will keep looking for my HG outdoor face sunscreen. I also tried it out for running, it seems to stay put. So I would repurchase for this purpose alone. I am also curious about the 2024 version, for those who have tried both versions please feel free to chime in on the differences :)\n\nFor those wondering about the differences between the Anessa and Shiseido sunscreens, below is a review I copy pasted from my previous review post for easy comparison:\n\nShiseido The Perfect Protector SPF50+ PA++++ : Milky, water-resistant sunscreen with a scent that lingers (not able to describe the scent). Easy to apply, dries to a nice dewy finish on the skin, but leaves a white cast on me. It is not too bad but still visible to me. After 1-2 hours, it starts to burn my eyes when I apply around them. I use it on my face and neck for running and it appears to stay put after sweating, so I might re-purchase this just for this purpose.\n\nCOSRX Aloe 54.2 Aqua Tone-Up Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ : This sunscreen has a slight sunscreen smell, creamy texture. The finish is patchy and uneven (made visible from the pink tint) no matter how much I try to rub it in. Tried the \u2018spread and tap\u2019 technique I saw from some Youtube videos, in which I need to spread a small amount on an area, then tap until it blends in. With this technique, it does blend better but it took me at least 15 minutes just to \u2018spread and tap\u2019 the proper amount. IMO, it is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. It is also sticky on my skin. Gives me eye-sting when applied around the eyes. Definitely would not repurchase. For reference, I did not know what a tone-up sunscreen is going in. A quick Google search told me that it\u2019s for evening out and brightening skin tone. So I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m using this the right way. \n\nMary & May Idebenone + Blackberry complex serum: Used this for 2 months. I apply 2 drops of this serum on the face after cleansing. It is a light watery serum, absorbs fast and non-sticky. It brightens my skin, the hydration is okay for me. I follow with a moisturizer and sunscreen, this gives me an instant glass skin look without looking oily. However I would not repurchase because this serum is not necessary for me, my daily sunscreen is already leaving a natural dewy finish on my skin which I like. For those who want more brightening effect, you might like this serum.\n\nRound Lab 1025 Dokdo toner : Bought this because of the hype. Used this for 2 months, twice daily. It\u2019s a watery toner, I use 2-3 layers of it and it does not feel sticky on my skin. The hydration is just okay for me. I would not repurchase because this does not do anything for me."
