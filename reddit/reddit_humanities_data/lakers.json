            "I think Bronny with time could be a contributor in the NBA. He physically is the similar to Eric Bledsoe. Height, wingspan, vertical all there. If he can defend at an above avg level and shoot avg, he can be a NBA player. Do I love the pick no, do I love that he will not play g league mins, no, but there is a world he can be solid.",
            "Didn't put the Knecht stuff into perspective until now. New Orleans chose to forgo this year's 17 draft pick. Then Knecht, who was projected top 5 or top 10, had to fall all the way to 17.\n\nWhatever the probability of all of that happening is, it's low.",
            "Atlanta wouldn\u2019t take DLO and Rui, wanted Reaves and settled for Nance\n\nThat\u2019s hilarious LMAOOOOO",
            "F the Clippers, but I think it\u2019s cool that Max\u2019s brother will be playing in LA too.",
            "Don't be surprised if we see Bron revitalized this year playing with his son, he's going crazy this year",
            "Thinking hard about it, I would put money down on Dalton Knecht for ROTY. All the prospects ahead of him either went to crowded situations (Risacher, Sheppard, Holland) or their offense is a major work in progress and they\u2019d have to be defensively amazing to win the award (Salaun, Castle, Clingan). Sarr is probably odds on favorite but even he isn\u2019t a lethal scorer or anything. I could legitimately see Dalton being a guy who could play an immediate major role, even possible start 10-15 games for us and average like 12 ppg on great efficiency and help us get a good seed. And since we\u2019re the Lakers he\u2019s going to be highly visible and if he has a lot of good games and moments, it could happen. He could be the next Malcolm Brogdon type ROTY.",
            "It sucks that Dlo's performances drops off in the playoffs. He is such a highly skilled offensive guard.",
            "Funny how much the main sub bitches about Laker attention when they cant stop posting about it lmao",
            "Go Lakers \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9b",
            "We desperately need a better scoring 2 way guard than Vincent and a backup centre. I believe we can get away with a Vando prince Rui Knecht wing rotation but somethings gotta change"

            "Best case scenario for D'Lo and the Lakeshow, this gives us a lot more versatility whether it's keeping him in P&G or in a trade.",
            "Thank you DLo",
            "Honestly pretty happy so far with the offseason gotta say, DLO comes back, we get a solid pick in the draft, and we got rid of ham for a guy who seems to REALLY care about doing well for the team",

            "I actually like Hayes. I think he showed a ton of promise at the back end of the regular season. We still need a true C but he is definitely serviceable as additional C or PF depth.\n\nI remember he was great against the Celtics in Boston. I also remember when he balled out in a regular season game against the Nuggets, even though we lost.",
            "I like this. Hayes played better toward the end of the season. He\u2019s a decent backup center for 15 minutes a game.",
            "I actually don\u2019t mind keeping and developing him as a 3rd string big. He\u2019s still 24 and will be cheap.",

Hawks are going to be even worse than last year.\n\nEdit: Spurs with Kawhi sent him to a championship in Toronto and Brooklyn with Kyrie just had to trade their \"cornerstone\" Bridges for picks lol\n\nE2: Kyrie was traded for Spencer Dinwiddie & Dorian Finney-Smith who never had a positive impact for the Nets, plus we have Spencer lol",
