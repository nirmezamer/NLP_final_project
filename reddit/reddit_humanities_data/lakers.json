            "Whether he stays or gets traded, this is a W. I don\u2019t see a possible MLE player that\u2019s better than DLo",
            "Whether we for sure trade him or for some reason keep him, this is two summers in a row he's done us a solid. Take it easy on the slandering on this dude",
            "Honestly pretty happy so far with the offseason gotta say, DLO comes back, we get a solid pick in the draft, and we got rid of ham for a guy who seems to REALLY care about doing well for the team",
            "Best case scenario for D'Lo and the Lakeshow, this gives us a lot more versatility whether it's keeping him in P&G or in a trade.",
            "Bro waited for Dejounte to get traded first",
            "Between Knecht and this it\u2019s been a great week in Lakerland",
            "Pop the champagne, fam. This is a major W for the Lakers. Now we hold much needed flexibility in the trade market. Worse case we run it back with Dlo.",
            "There were so many people who were adamant he wouldn\u2019t pick this up. \n\nWho else was gonna give him $19m this year?",
            "Hell fucking yes! This is so huge!\n\nNot picking up the option would\u2019ve been a disaster for us.",
            "honestly $18 million for a 3rd option in the regular season is good value"

            "Win win. Either he stays and keeps shooting the lights out (regular season at least) or we can flip him for someone else.",
            "Regardless, we needed him to opt in so we don't lose the salary.",

            "I like this. Hayes played better toward the end of the season. He\u2019s a decent backup center for 15 minutes a game.",
            "I actually don\u2019t mind keeping and developing him as a 3rd string big. He\u2019s still 24 and will be cheap.",
            "I actually like Hayes. I think he showed a ton of promise at the back end of the regular season. We still need a true C but he is definitely serviceable as additional C or PF depth.\n\nI remember he was great against the Celtics in Boston. I also remember when he balled out in a regular season game against the Nuggets, even though we lost.",
            "Great\u2026 but I\u2019d feel a lot better with another center on the roster that\u2019s a little bulkier to round out the rotation",
            "Please tell me he wasted no time to hit the gym and practicing on his rebounds",
            "Surprised.  I thought he and Cam would both leave.\n\nHe played well during stretches and learned not to foul constantly - a skill many bigs never master.",
            "the whole team is staggering their option announcements for tonight apparently\n\nCam Reddish announced in 45 minutes, I guess",
            "The guy is 24, we just drafted a 23 yr old\u2026 give him sometime and I think he can develop in to a solid back up center",
            "We legit have no roster spots we HAVE to make a trade bruh",
