        "content": "Yesterday, I was eating alone in a fast food resto. May mag-ina na magkatabi and the kid was maybe 5-7 years old. Their food was already served by the crew pero di pa sila kumakain kasi parang may  hinihintay pa sila. Suddenly, natabig ng bata yung drinks and nagkalat sa table nila. The mother get mad to the kid, pero first reaction ng bata ay nag sorry agad sya sa mommy and admit na natabig nya yung drinks.  Pero yung mother was still mad at him, paulit-ulit sya kinurot kahit na panay sorry ng bata. Yung bata umiiyak na pero sinusubukang i-compose sarili nya while silently crying. \nTinawag ng mother yung crew para makisuyo na ipalinis (nice naman approach nya). Maya-maya dumating na rin yung daddy,  nagulat sa nangyari na natapon ang drinks and asks ano nangyare.  In-admit ng bata na natabig nya yung drinks while saying sorry crying and scratching his eyes. \nI feel bad na hindi kinomfort ng magulang nya yung bata. Knowing na inamin naman ng bata and say sorry na di nya sinadya. \nImbes na i-comfort lalo pa pinagalitan kasi his scratching his eyes while crying, ayun kinurot na naman ng nanay nya. \nI don't know, wala pa naman ako anak and still single but it breaks my heart na ganun sila sa bata, though hindi naman nila sinigawan or slap pero yung moment na nag sorry ang bata pero lalo pa rin sya pinagalitan. I want to hug the kid para i-comfort pero di dapat ako makialam kung panu idisplina ng ibang tao ang sarili nila anak.   \n\nTo my future self, sana di ako maging katulad ng ganun na magulang. I try to give benefit of the doubt na baka may pinagdadaanan lang din yung nanay kaya ganun sya kalupit sa bata. Hays.\nSana di maramdaman ng bata na di sya mahal ng magulang nya dahil dun. ",

            "This is why most of the kids these days grow up na parang people pleaser. Kahit di nila kasalan, they kept on saying sorry or even if it is beyond their control already. This is so sad. Hays :<",
            "kung ganyan na sila mangdisiplina sa anak nila publicly, what more pa sa bahay nila :(( The sad thing is 'gentle parenting' is frowned upon majority of Filipino families, pero I have hope na new generation parents can break the cycle.",
            "Ano ba namang klaseng parents yan. Hindi maganda sa emotional development ng bata pag pinapagalitan/pinagsasabihan sa harap ng ibang tao. They should do that in private.",

            "Aww this reminds me of me and my brother nung bata pa kami\ud83e\udd7a Whenever we spill something sinisigawan and pinapalo kami even sa public. One time nung nahulog ng brother ko ang burger sa floor, pinalo siya ng papa namin then my dad dragged him out while my brother was crying loudly and tandang tanda ko pa yung tinginan ng mga tao. It was humiliating. I was less than 5yrs old that time but tandang tanda ko parin including yung lahat ng humiliating experiences ko in public just because we were clumsy as a child. Ayun, me and my bro grew up really shy and socially anxious \ud83e\udee0I feel bad for this kid, sana experiences like this won\u2019t get to him but I doubt it since matandain ang mga bata pagdating sa mga ganto. Parents need to know na children are naturally clumsy since they\u2019re still learning. Humiliating and beating them up for making mistakes could take a toll on them and madadala nila hanggang paglaki.",
