        "content": "The Championships draw is out, and the top half are in the trenches. Similarly to the Australian Open, Swiatek has a very tough quarter and I don\u2019t expect her to win the tournament.\n\nHowever, and this might be delusion, I think there\u2019s space for a pleasant surprise.\nWe haven\u2019t seen her grass form yet, because of her team\u2019s choice of waiving any preparation tournaments. I don\u2019t think that means they\u2019re giving up on Wimbledon\u2026 her team is super professional and the thought that they\u2019d just give Wimbledon up seems out of character so my guess is they chose to focus on resting from some intense 9 weeks and work on technique.\n\nThings in Swiatek\u2019s favour that make me think we might be in for a pleasant surprise:\n1. She has been working on her net game since last year \n2. Serve has improved\n3. She\u2019s been using a bit more slices \n4. Lack of pressure as she\u2019s not the favourite and her no1 spot is secured\n\nDo you guys think this is all insanity from a hopeful fan or is there some reason to these thoughts? I guess time will tell, but speculation is the fuel tennis lives on \ud83d\ude02 ",

            "I think she's not the favorite but it wouldn't be a huge surprise for the #1 seed to win Wimbledon. She's still the best player in the world so I think she can find ways to win even if she's not playing her best game. \n\nHer team did speak about Wimbledon at the beginning of the year and it didn't seem like they were giving up on it. However they might be planning her peak form for the olympics so I guess we'll see!",
            "I'm pretty pessimistic, to be honest. I guess we'll see against Kenin. If it's a struggle to win that, then it definitely won't bode well. I always feel like, on grass, she can't play bad and win like she's shown she can do on hard courts and clay. A bad game against anyone half decent and she's a goner. But we also haven't seen her play on grass yet this season, so we haven't seen how her new service motion works there or if she's gonna go to the net or add in drop shots and slices.",
            "I want her to win the Olympics, but keeping a win streak from Madrid all the way to the Olympics, with two slam wins in it, seems insane. I feel like her losing at Wimbledon would remove a bit of the pressure she'll inevitably face at the Olympics",
            "She should return to her roots and use slices and drop shots more. Would greatly help her on faster surfaces since she obviously can't just change her grip to hit flatter and take the ball earlier since that's too unnatural. Topspinbotting doesn't work against big hitters because the higher bounce allows them to tee off",
            "I would be happy if she survives the First round.\n\nNo tournament on Grass, tough opponnent.",
            "I watched highlights of her juniors W2018. Seems she had a killer serve then (she served 190 km/h bombs against Raducanu, with great placement). Motion was different and looked better. She played drop shots, etc. It was overall fantastic to watch",
            "I don't love her draw, but she is much better on grass than people think, only Rybakina and Jabeur have better win percentages. Also the improvement to her serve should only help her this year.",
            "Tough draw, feels like Iga gets a lot of tough draws relative to Sabalenka for instance.\n\nOh well, gonna have to do it the hard way, at least the glory will be greater!",
            "She should do fine. Her serve has gotten huge recently, her form and confidence is better than last year + she is rested.\n\nDon't understand people who are concerned about Kenin already. I wouldn't be shocked if she won the whole thing.",
            "Her chances are as good as anybut Rybakina and Sabalenka are definitely the favouritesbut I think they is probably the most open of the 4 slams as no one really feels completely comfortable on grassas far as Swiatek goes, I wouldnt be surprised to see her win, but I highly doubt she does.."
