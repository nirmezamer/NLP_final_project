On top of that, she had already withdrawn from the OG because she knew her body couldn't handle it. \n\nTennis players' bodies due to the heavy strain are collapsing. This shows how difficult the tour is and tennis players need to be given more time to rest, instead of extending tournaments causing constant play. Iga played from BJKC until Paris for 8 weeks without a break.",
