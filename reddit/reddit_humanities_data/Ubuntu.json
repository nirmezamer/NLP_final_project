So much so that when the name of my USB drive changed after rebooting Ubuntu, I connected it to my Windows PC and used an app to change the label. \n\nWhen I reconnected it, it wasn\u2019t mounted automatically as was the case before (I run CasaOS).  This caused a downward spiral of me trying to mount and unmount the disk, change permissions, and whatever other fixes I could find online to get it back to working again. Now, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m left with, and I got some file systems errors here and there. I see the drive when I run a lsblk command, but it shows no additional information like fstype or UUID. It doesn\u2019t show up when I try a blkid command\n\nI have 10TB of data on the drive that I can\u2019t lose and would appreciate any help here.  Again, not sure how to check to see if the files are ok using Ubuntu right now, but when I connect it to windows, the In Use numbers suggest everything\u2019s still there. ",

I would think your fstab needs to be updated to mount by the UUID if it was using some other identifier like a label that's now \"missing\". Can running a portable OS on a flash drive connected to the same tower find the hard drive and maybe a UUID?",
            "Sure you can lose those files. You prove it by not having them backed up and messing with the drive, while not knowing what you are doing. That is how you lose data. Permanently.\n\n\n\nIf you TRULY can't lose the files, stop!\u00a0\n\n\nThen image the drive to a larger drive. Then make a copy of the the image. Then try to fix and mount the copy of the image.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you fail, hire some data rescue experts. Send them the original drive and a copy of the image."
