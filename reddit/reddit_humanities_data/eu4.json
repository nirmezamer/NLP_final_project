Is there a way of making a vassal independent and still play as it? As it seems now, my two options are releasing every possible vassal as Italy, giving away everything but the capital and disbanding all armies before releasing Mamluks so it's easy to win an Independence war, or to force convert myself to Islam through rebels, moving capital to Cairo and then forming first Mamluks and then Egypt.
