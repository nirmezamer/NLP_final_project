            "Still waiting on the requirements for the new DTV (Destination Thailand Visa) which is supposed to be a DN visa in one of the categories\u2026 180 days, multiple entry, 5 years validity, minimum 20 years of age, 500k baht proof of funds, one extension for 180 days. Thats all what we officialy now as of now.",
            "I am writing my master's thesis on digital nomads. I have already analyzed a lot of materials and see interesting apspekts of your life. I am looking for people who would like to answer some questions. I am looking for people who have already been nomads for some time as well as those who have just started. I would appreciate your help",
            "Hey, what are places to find Digital Nomad jobs for software engineers?",
            "I have no idea why but I'm seeing a lot of Digital Nomads, in Argentina.",
            "I\u2019ve read in several places that UK nationals can work remotely for a UK company for up to 90 days without a visa in both Brazil and Ecuador. And if they want to stay longer, then they need to apply for a digital nomad visa. It seems too good to be true! Has anyone from the UK done this? Have you had any issues with it?",
            "I\u2019ll throw another question out there: Does anyone know good rental website (besides booking/agora/airbnb) if I want to stay max out my 3 months in Japan? I\u2019ve seen Oakhouse as an option.",
            "One way for the average person to make the digital nomad lifestyle possible is to work a lot of overtime when you are in the US but then go on three-month vacations at a time.\n\nThe money you make from overtime pays for the months you are on vacation since PTO will run out.",
            "new here, so what jobs do you do?  \nare you self employed or employee?",
            "Seeking tax advice: for starters, I'm a Canadian citizen. However, I have been living in Europe for the past 8ish years going back and forth between studying and working. Recently I have been living in Italy where I just completed a PhD and following that I was offered a temporary, remote contractor position by a UK-based organization. I want to take advantage of the situation and enjoy the digital nomad life in Asia but I have no idea how I would go about paying taxes. I cut ties with Canada long ago and no longer pay taxes there and I will have spent less than 183 days in Italy so technically I wouldn't be considered a tax resident here either. I'm not planning on staying more than half a year in any one country for the foreseeable future, so would I actually need to pay taxes anywhere? Any advice or recommendations for an international tax advisor are greatly appreciated! TIA!",

        "content": "#Read the [WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/index) before posting\n\n9 times out of 10 it will have the answers you are looking for. \n\n## Where is my post?\n\n**Why isn't my post showing up?**\n\nIf you are new to reddit, posting with a new account, or posting with an account that has not been widely used your post will be flagged as it either looks like spam, or is highly likely to be an FAQ covered in the wiki above. We ask that you please spend some time searching through existing posts, reviewing the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/) or participating in the sub to build up enough karma to post. You can also post a comment in the Monthly Megathread pinned to the top of the sub. \n\n**I am not new to reddit but post still isn't showing up, why not?**\n\nDue to the volume of posts we get on a few very specific subjects we will often remove or not-approve certain posts on certain topics that have been recently discussed. Here are some common questions that get posted at least 5 times a day:\n\n* [Jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/digital-nomad-jobs) : What job should I get / what do you all do / are there any XYZ nomads / what should I study / how do I get started\n\n* [Health Insurance related questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/health)\n\n* [VPNs](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/vpn) : How do I hide my location from my employer \n\n* [FEIE](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/feie) and also [US taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/4tck9u/the_ultimate_tax_and_money_guide_for_digital/) \n\n## My post wasn't related to any of those things, why isn't it showing up?\n\n**Does your post violate our rules on self promotion?**\n\nOK, here\u2019s the deal. We understand that for many of us, entrepreneurship and digital nomad are concepts that go hand in hand. Many of us here are working towards booting up great products, and some working towards products that cater directly to the DN community. But, this sub is not a community full of potential people to market to with your posts.\n\nYour product may be great, brilliant, and what every DN needs but never knew it, but if that\u2019s true then it\u2019ll be talked about by the community once it\u2019s known - through other channels. In this sub, we frequently get spam and does the entire community a disservice. Users get annoyed, the community starts to weaken, the moderators get overly aggressive, posts that should be OK end up automatically in the spam filter. These things are not good for anyone.\n\n**Here\u2019s some No No\u2019s:**\n\n* Absolutely no surveys. Surveys will be removed without mercy.\n\n* No requests for interviews, or people to talk to on your blog/book/podcast/etc.\n\n* Anything about illegal activities. You\u2019ll be awarded a ban, and maybe then some.\n\n* No asking for \u201cplease review/try my\u2026\u201d. There are many other subs for just that.\n\n* Looking for Work type posts. See the Jobs wiki if you are looking for work\n\n* Job postings. If you have a job that you are trying to hire for please post it in the Weekly Discussion Threads. \n\n* Fund my kickstarter! Nope. Not even for your \u201cfriend\u201d.\n\n* Any \u201copportunity\u201d to become a partner / investor. We can\u2019t tell this from a scam, so it\u2019ll be treated like a scam.\n\n* No direct links to products using an affiliate ID. If you\u2019re caught, you\u2019ll be punished.\n\n* Posting to software/apps/web sites/etc, with \"PM me for access\". If it's not public, it's not welcome.\n\n* Posting software/apps/etc that aren't complete and ready to use. This isn't a user interest collection sub.\n\n\n**Here\u2019s some highly discouraged things:**\n\n* Linking to your youtube channel - We do allow people to share youtube videos if they are relevant and if they come from users who are active in the community and provide valuable content such as trip reports. If you want to share your youtube content please message the mods first for approval. \n\n* Linking to your own blog - We allow you to share your blog as a link in a self post if the primary content of the blog post is also included in the self post and the link is more of a \"Click here to learn more\". \n\n* Top X lists without detailed reviews for each item. We don't hate lists but these posts are rarely useful. Instead of posting a link, post the content of the list in a self post for discussion. \n\n* \"Where should I go\" posts : Check out the Trip Reports for Inspiration. If you still want advice be very specific about what you are looking for, and be sure to include important information like your nationality and budget/ \n\n## LAPTOP PICS / LOCATION PICS\n\nThis gets its own section because it is somewhat controversial. If you are posting a pretty picture of somewhere you are, you MUST fill out either a [trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ATrip%2BReport) or answer the automod questions about the place. Anyone found dumping pictures without giving in depth information about the location will have their post removed. \n\n\n## Suggestions\n\nIf your post still isn't showing up and you think it should, [message the moderators first](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdigitalnomad) and be sure to include the word \"peanut\" in the message title so we know you read this.\n\nHave a product you want to inform us about? Buy an ad on reddit to target this (and other) related subs. You\u2019ll get the exposure you want, without the community backlash. It\u2019s good for reddit as a whole too!\n\nWant to talk about a product or service that\u2019s not yours, but you really like? Try linking to a third party, impartial review from a known trusted source. If you wrote it, avoid affiliate links in the article and be sure to mention any relevant disclosures if you are involved with creating the product or marketing it.\n\nWant to link to your site about your experience with something? Great! We encourage that, but focus on the content not how many visitors might join your mailing list. If you truly were writing content for the greater good, put it on medium.com.\n\nInstead of a Top 10 list, which has just a picture and some basic stats: Write a detailed comparison of just two places. With real meaty content, data and stories.\n\nHave a coupon for a product? Actually, that might be good. But unless it\u2019s a high ticket item like a car or laptop, 5% off won\u2019t cut it. The coupon must have more value to the community than for the person that posted it.\n\nThanks!\n\n- The moderation team",

I'm headed to Asia for the first time in December for \\~ a month, going to fly either into or out of Tokyo, but still deciding how to structure the rest of the trip.\n\nLooking for opinions on whether to spend a month in Japan or whether to hop around a few different places in SE Asia too (I know they aren't quick flights). I'd love a nice mix of city / nature and I'll need to be working for a little bit most days although will do my best to take off as much as possible.\n\nLmk your thoughts!",

            "There's so much to see and do in Tokyo and the surrounding area, it wouldn't be hard to spend a month there. I've been in Osaka for the last 10 days and been enjoying it more than Tokyo I think. Friendlier people, more people willing to speak a little English, willing to help with directions or suggestions, and while still a big city, a whole lot less busy than Tokyo.\n\nBasically, I think there's so much in Japan, 1 month is great to check it out. I'm here for 2 months and feel like it's not enough time",
            "Japan is a world of its own. You really start to understand it deeper the longer you stay. I\u2019d recommend staying there the whole month and saving SEA for a another trip.",
            "Stay in tokio, visit mount fuji one weekend.",
            "I've been in Japan for 6 months, Osaka and Hamamatsu and I've only barely scratched the surface.",
            "Appreciate it - do you have any recommendations for that second city in Japan?",
            "Most countries in SEA require more than a few days to see the best of of it, and you will be working, so you will have even less time - if you try to do that most likely you are just going to get FOMO for being in places with lots of cool things to do, but with no time to do any of those things \n\n\n2 cities for 2 weeks each, one can be outside Japan if you feel like",
            "I\u2019d do 2 cities max for 2 weeks each. You are not familiar with asia on top of that. \n\nIf you plan on hopping around more than that you will be burning at least a day or more coming and going each time.\n\nI\u2019m based out here in asia and even I wouldn\u2019t jump around more than that. I have in the past but usually planning around scuba trips."

            "Right this second, BA is the winner by far. I'm here now and getting 1320ars for every dollar per my Charles Schwab card. Every week or so the currency exchange is getting better but the prices are not updated that quickly around the city. Especially housing but also food and groceries. \n\nBUT, that will even out. If you are coming to BA in the next 6 months I would say BA, past that probably Lima because BA will bounce back, just not sure when. \n\nLima prices, especially housing are just dramatic for locations. That thing where tourists pay more because of where they stay is true everywhere but it WAY more true in Lima. I like to stay in \"bad areas\" but even if that makes you uncomfortable, do your shopping and dining in those areas and then get back to your nice area for the evening if you want to save a LOT while in Lima.",
            "I stay in the cheapest private Airbnbs and pay weekly, I am paying $120-150 a week. For my family (7M & 41F) we are spending around $10-15usd a day on everything else. There are hosts who offer to pay off platform and give crazy good rates but I don't ever go off platform. And those prices don't tend to move much week to week or month to month. \n\nWe don't eat out much but you can get a nice meal for $17 including a dessert to share.\n\nYou can find endless takeout options in the $5-8 per person range.\n\nAgain, the prices are updated slowly whereas the currency gets better quickly.\n\nThis trip we have been here since May 15th. Since we arrived the stores have changed prices and done some shrinkflation. These little breakfast bars my kid loves went from a 6-pack for 3k to a 4-pack for 2.7k. Just a tiny example but I mean literally last week 1usd was worth 1250, the week before 1200, the week before 1150. Stores, especially large chains can't keep up with that sort of movement. Lots of restaurants will have online menus they can change or the plastic menus you can write on so they can change but still, nobody is changing their prices as quickly as inflation is happening."
