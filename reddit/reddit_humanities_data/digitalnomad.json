I'm planning to relocate to Greece and live off dividends paid by my UAE company to minimize taxes.\n\nI understand that as a non-resident for the first 6 months, I'll only pay a 5% tax on my foreign dividends.\n\n**My question:**\u00a0After 6 months and becoming a Greek tax resident, will these foreign dividends still be taxed at 5%, or will they be considered personal income and taxed under the regular progressive system (up to 44%)?\n\nI know a tax professional could give the most accurate answer, but I was hoping someone on this subreddit might have experience with a similar situation.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But there's something I want to double check. I read the wiki about taxes but didn't see an answer to my specific concern.\n\nSo my work doesn't care if I work from a different country. If when I file my taxes I don't file a Utah state return. Does that change anything for the paperwork on my employers end? like do they have to say that to Utah or federal that I'm working from elsewhere?"

We ask that you please spend some time searching through existing posts, reviewing the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/) or participating in the sub to build up enough karma to post. You can also post a comment in the Monthly Megathread pinned to the top of the sub. \n\n**I am not new to reddit but post still isn't showing up, why not?**\n\nDue to the volume of posts we get on a few very specific subjects we will often remove or not-approve certain posts on certain topics that have been recently discussed. Here are some common questions that get posted at least 5 times a day:\n\n* [Jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/digital-nomad-jobs) : What job should I get / what do you all do / are there any XYZ nomads / what should I study / how do I get started\n\n* [Health Insurance related questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/health)\n\n* [VPNs](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/vpn) : How do I hide my location from my employer \n\n* [FEIE](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/feie) and also [US taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/4tck9u/the_ultimate_tax_and_money_guide_for_digital/) \n\n## My post wasn't related to any of those things, why isn't it showing up?\n\n**Does your post violate our rules on self promotion?**\n\nOK, here\u2019s the deal. We understand that for many of us, entrepreneurship and digital nomad are concepts that go hand in hand. Many of us here are working towards booting up great products, and some working towards products that cater directly to the DN community. But, this sub is not a community full of potential people to market to with your posts.\n\nYour product may be great, brilliant, and what every DN needs but never knew it, but if that\u2019s true then it\u2019ll be talked about by the community once it\u2019s known - through other channels. In this sub, we frequently get spam and does the entire community a disservice. Users get annoyed, the community starts to weaken, the moderators get overly aggressive, posts that should be OK end up automatically in the spam filter. These things are not good for anyone.\n\n**Here\u2019s some No No\u2019s:**\n\n* Absolutely no surveys. Surveys will be removed without mercy.\n\n* No requests for interviews, or people to talk to on your blog/book/podcast/etc.\n\n* Anything about illegal activities. You\u2019ll be awarded a ban, and maybe then some.\n\n* No asking for \u201cplease review/try my\u2026\u201d. There are many other subs for just that.\n\n* Looking for Work type posts. See the Jobs wiki if you are looking for work\n\n* Job postings. If you have a job that you are trying to hire for please post it in the Weekly Discussion Threads. \n\n* Fund my kickstarter! Nope. Not even for your \u201cfriend\u201d.\n\n* Any \u201copportunity\u201d to become a partner / investor. We can\u2019t tell this from a scam, so it\u2019ll be treated like a scam.\n\n* No direct links to products using an affiliate ID. If you\u2019re caught, you\u2019ll be punished.\n\n* Posting to software/apps/web sites/etc, with \"PM me for access\". If it's not public, it's not welcome.\n\n* Posting software/apps/etc that aren't complete and ready to use. This isn't a user interest collection sub.\n\n\n**Here\u2019s some highly discouraged things:**\n\n* Linking to your youtube channel - We do allow people to share youtube videos if they are relevant and if they come from users who are active in the community and provide valuable content such as trip reports. If you want to share your youtube content please message the mods first for approval. \n\n* Linking to your own blog - We allow you to share your blog as a link in a self post if the primary content of the blog post is also included in the self post and the link is more of a \"Click here to learn more\". \n\n* Top X lists without detailed reviews for each item. We don't hate lists but these posts are rarely useful. Instead of posting a link, post the content of the list in a self post for discussion. \n\n* \"Where should I go\" posts : Check out the Trip Reports for Inspiration. If you still want advice be very specific about what you are looking for, and be sure to include important information like your nationality and budget/ \n\n## LAPTOP PICS / LOCATION PICS\n\nThis gets its own section because it is somewhat controversial. If you are posting a pretty picture of somewhere you are, you MUST fill out either a [trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ATrip%2BReport) or answer the automod questions about the place. Anyone found dumping pictures without giving in depth information about the location will have their post removed. \n\n\n## Suggestions\n\nIf your post still isn't showing up and you think it should, [message the moderators first](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdigitalnomad) and be sure to include the word \"peanut\" in the message title so we know you read this.\n\nHave a product you want to inform us about? Buy an ad on reddit to target this (and other) related subs. You\u2019ll get the exposure you want, without the community backlash. It\u2019s good for reddit as a whole too!\n\nWant to talk about a product or service that\u2019s not yours, but you really like? Try linking to a third party, impartial review from a known trusted source. If you wrote it, avoid affiliate links in the article and be sure to mention any relevant disclosures if you are involved with creating the product or marketing it.\n\nWant to link to your site about your experience with something? Great! We encourage that, but focus on the content not how many visitors might join your mailing list. If you truly were writing content for the greater good, put it on medium.com.\n\nInstead of a Top 10 list, which has just a picture and some basic stats: Write a detailed comparison of just two places. With real meaty content, data and stories.\n\nHave a coupon for a product? Actually, that might be good. But unless it\u2019s a high ticket item like a car or laptop, 5% off won\u2019t cut it. The coupon must have more value to the community than for the person that posted it.\n\nThanks!\n\n- The moderation team",

Many residents are unable to afford an apartment after rents have risen by close to 70% in the past 10 years, while the cost of buying a home has increased by almost 40%, Collboni said at a City Council meeting on 21 June, adding that access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people. This has led the local government to take drastic measures to guarantee access to housing in the city, the mayor of Barcelona continued.\n\n\"We cannot permit that the majority of young people who wish to leave home also have to leave Barcelona,\" said Collboni,\u00a0[according to leading Spanish newspaper El Pais](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html).\n\nThe issue of overtourism has been a growing concern in Barcelona in recent years.\n\n# Spain, the second most-visited country in the world\n\nSpain is one of the\u00a0[most-visited countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261726/countries-ranked-by-number-of-international-tourist-arrivals/). According to a report published by Statista in June 2024, the country\u2019s visitor numbers are second only to those of France, having received more than 85 million international tourists in 2023, a higher number than the pre-pandemic record of 83 million in 2019. Meanwhile, Catalonia, with its capital city Barcelona, was\u00a0[the region of Spain that received the most international tourists in 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/447801/foreign-tourists-visiting-spain-by-destination-region/).\n\nIn recent years it has become increasingly tricky to obtain permission for short-term apartment rentals in Barcelona. Since 2012, a tourist licence has been required in order to legally rent out an apartment defined as a \u201cVivienda de Uso Tur\u00edstico\u201d (home for tourism use) in Barcelona for a duration of fewer than 31 days. Last year, the rules were tightened with licenses being limited to a maximum of ten tourist apartments per 100 inhabitants. In addition, the city put an end to permanent licenses for\u00a0tourist apartments, instead forcing them to be renewed every five years. The local government has also been redoubling its efforts to hunt down and shutter illegal tourist rentals.\n\nBarcelona's Gothic Quarter gets especially crowded during the busy the summer season.\n\n# The war against illegal tourist apartments\n\nThese measures have resulted in the shutting down of 9,700 illegal tourist rentals since 2016, while almost 3,500 apartments have been converted back into housing for local residents.\n\nToday\u2019s move is the most drastic to date, one that the leading Barcelona-based daily newspaper\u00a0[La Vanguardia predicts will result in a \"bloody judicial war\"](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20240621/9749899/barcelona-eliminara-todos-pisos-turisticos.html). If Mayor Collboni gets his way, the City Council will eliminate the 10,101 licensed tourist apartments currently in the city no later than November 2028. His move, which has left the tourism sector stunned, is expected to be opposed by various players, not least the employers\u2019 association of Barcelona's tourist apartments, and will likely result in a drawn-out legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, vacation rental platform Airbnb, which hosts a considerable number of Barcelona\u2019s short-term rental listings, has not yet made an official [statement.Barcelona](http://statement.Barcelona) Announces Plan To Ban Tourist Rental Apartments By 2028\n\n[Isabelle Kliger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabellekliger/)\n\nAnnouncement came early this afternoon via El Pais: [https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html)",
