The specified crew order only applies to the selected vehicle preset; accordingly, each vehicle preset can have its own crew order.

            "The Ace Combat comparison always strikes me as strange because in that series, missiles have unrealistically *poor* maneuvering/agility and are easily avoidable by just turning. As it's not a series to care about realism, the focus is just on fun, and having missiles be nigh guaranteed kills would be really boring gameplay which no sane developer would ever-\n\nOh wait. Hi Gaijin.\n\nAs a bit of an extra note, I grew up playing games like Ace Combat so when I first reached higher BR jets in this game it was extremely jarring that I couldn't just turn to avoid missiles. It's a very strange concept coming from arcade flight games. I can't say I've ever found it fun. Getting hit by an AIM-9L in a G.91YS rarely feels deserved. Eating an AMRAAM in an F-104S.ASA doesn't feel any better.",

        "content": "History\nIn 1992, the South Korean Army initiated the development of the K2 Black Panther, responding to their need for a next-generation tank. The Ministry of National Defence organized a seminar, led by Dr. Eui-Hwan Kim, inviting experts from various countries to provide advice before the concept design phase.\n\nThe attendees included:\n\nIsrael: General Israel Tal (Merkava 1/2/3)\nJapan: MHI engineer Hayashi Iwao (Type 74/Type 90)\nUSA: General Dynamics engineer Philip W. Lett (M48/M60/M1)\nSweden: Bofors engineer Sven Berge (Strv 74/Strv 103/UDES Project)\nUnited Kingdom: Professor Richard M. Ogorkiewicz, Imperial College London\nStarting in July 1995, the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) conducted systematic conceptual research on the next-generation tank until December 1997. This involved determining the tank\u2019s capabilities, performance, appearance, necessary technologies, development methods, and expected efficiency.\n\nOverseas studies were conducted with the Ministry of National Defense\u2019s permission, sending 7 individuals to the UK for a year of training.\n\nBetween November 1998 and December 2002, ADD developed numerous technologies and software for the next-generation tank, including the K2\u2019s cannon, target tracker, APS, and autoloader.\n\nFull-scale development commenced in 2003, and after four years, the first prototype emerged in 2007. In September 2008, it was declared combat-ready. Due to delays in developing a domestic powerpack, the German powerpack from the prototype (MTU MT883 Ka-501 engine and Renk HSWL 295 transmission) was used for the initial production in 2011.\n\nIn second productions, the K2 was equipped with a powerpack featuring a DV27K engine from Doosan Infracor (now HD Hyundai Infracor) and a Renk HSWL 295 transmission, which continued in the third production, including the K2GF exported to Poland.\n\nFirepower\nK2 tank is equipped with the CN08 120mm L/55 tank cannon as its primary weapon and the M60E2 as its coaxial machine gun. Additionally, it has a 12.7mm K6 machine gun mounted in the commander\u2019s hatch for multipurpose use.\n\n Spoiler\nProtection\nThe basic structure of the K2 tank is made of MIL-12560H steel plates, and the composite armor is made of SiC, replacing the AlO3 used in the first-generation KSAP, to achieve higher protection. In addition, it is equipped with ERA, LWR, and MWR to achieve high survivability.\n\n Spoiler\nMobility\nK2 tank has a 51t basic weight, 55t combat weight, 70km/h forward and 34km/h reverse top speed and can climb up to 31\u00b0 slope.\n\n Spoiler\nInterior\n3 crew members are on board, and ammunition storage is located at the rear of the turret and the front left of the hull.\n\n Spoiler\nSources\n Spoiler",

            "I think lots of people, me included, would like to see this. The main sticking point is where it and other South Korean vehicles should actually go.\n\nA lot of people on this sub say they should go with Japan, but I don't really think so. There's the bad history those two countries share, and Japan didn't have anything to do with the development of South Korean vehicles or vice versa. A lot of it is just Japanese mains who feel entitled to shiny new vehicles in a tree they've already grinded out. I don't blame them at all for wanting new toys to play with, but keep it to things which actually make sense, like a Thai subtree.\n\nAn option which theoretically makes a lot more sense is the USA due to their close relations and them being heavily involved in the development of South Korean vehicles, as well as the South Koreans using a lot of American equipment, but they have plenty of vehicles of their own and they don't need a subtree.\n\nTherefore, in my view, the best option is to have a unified Korean tree which starts after a certain rank, like Israel's tree. They could even throw a Turkish subtree in there as well since they've collaborated on vehicle development and there for sure aren't enough Turkish vehicles for a standalone tree.",
