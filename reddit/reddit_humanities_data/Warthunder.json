            "Thats actually an amazing sale too bad its not on console. Hopefully we get something that isnt the same 5 planes theyve put on sale the last few times.",
            "GE and Talismans won't be on sale I presume?",

            "Ok, Ill buy Leopard 2A4 PzBtl 123 Since Tier VII is embarassing, no completely lineup",
            "35 (I guess the same stands true for $) for a vehicle that includes 2.5k GE and 20 days of premium, which cost respectively 16,5 and 7,5, is actually really good, means you actually pay 14 for the vehicle itself (I know, I'm not considering the discounts for larger packs of GE and premium time)",
            "Before anyone asks, do not waste your time or money with the JASDF F-4EJ ADSTW. Its great as a bomb/rocket truck, really poor as a dogfighter. Additionally, the tech tree F-4EJ (not the Kai, the EJ) is identical in every way except the premium status and the admittedly cool black livery."

            "The begleit is a lot of fun and the leopard a1a1 is also great just depends on what you want from the tank",
            "I will say the Begleitpanzer 57 although i don't recommend play 9.3 and 9.7 since it's just up tiers",
            "Begleitpanzer 57 is fun to play",
            "since when can you collapse ranks????",
            "German m48s arent so good. Kpz is really fast and armor is mid but the gun doesnt do any damage for some reason. Go for the begleitpanzer 57 or the leo a1a1/1a5",
            "Bagel is probably the most fun high tier tank in the entire game imo But preferably, you should have 9.0 stuff before you get it. Also I'm no sure if 9.3 is still an uptier hellhole.",
            "I will be getting the bagel then.",
            "9.3 plays with 10.3 like 90% of the time is there really isnt much difference. you'll get bad matchups every game",
            "Get Leopard A1A1 as a backup for TAM. Begleitpanzer 57 is very situational, requires good positionals and a blind/deaf sloth reflexes enemies to be effective and its main AP round has terrible velocity. And don't even think about taking M48A2 with DM23 higher than 8.3. APFSDS is good but it struggles with no stabilizer and poor mobility. KPz-70 has a nice 6-second reload with an autoloader and it is fast but its top round is miserable post-nerf when all you see at 9.3 is full uptiers to Leopards 2A4, Abrams M1s, T-80Bs, Objects 292 etc that don't need to aim to kill you while the best damage you might inflict is yellow crew member on a direct HEAD hit. Leopard 1A5 is good with DM33 and 1st gen thermals but again it barely faces anything below 10.3 and you are a glass cannon.   \n  \nMy advice would be to rush to 10.0-10.3 as soon as possible (TAM 2C, PUMA, Leopard 2A4, Flarakpanzer, maybe even Wiesel 1A2 together with them) becasue it's a blackhole that sucks in everything up to 1 BR away and you will mostly play against the vehicles of your own battle rating or lower with some rare 11.3, and difference between 10,3 and 11.3 is not that noticeable than between 9.3 and 10.3 that is hella compressed now. So, for now make yourself a lineup with a 8.3 Gepard (more effective as a rat corner-camping tank destroyer and not as pure SPAA), TAM, JaPz.K A2, Leopard A1A1, Alpha Jet and maybe even Huey with 6 AGM-22s and stick to it until you have enough vehicles of 10.0-10.3 purchased. Skip 9.3-9.7 entirely unless you don't care about your mental health.",
            "Personally I love the M48 Super. It has more horse power then the previous one and often seems bomb/AGM proof. A really good MBT if a slightly slow one at that."
