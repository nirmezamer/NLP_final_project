            "Dallas is definitely more stressful but I don\u2019t put all the blame on the drivers. \n\nThe highway system is more convoluted than anywhere else I\u2019ve driven; it forces drivers to be aggressive just to do normal things like exit the highway. I\u2019ve also been in multiple situations where I have to quickly slow down from 70 to 25 even though nobody has done anything wrong."

The winters, while not warm, are milder than Chicago and cities in the Midwest or Northeast because of the lack of snow. I think the goal of Dallas, both now and in the future, is to just be a major city that's also a good place to work and live.",
