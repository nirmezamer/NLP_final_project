I could care less if they just flop once whatever get ur brain disease out of the way... but when they constantly do it and never get back on defense constantly spamming it? I feel like every time you use it, it should slowly eat away at your teammate grade and if you do it too often, you'll get booted eventually? It's just frustrating trying to play rec and everybody who seems to be the WORST at the game, seems to expect you to play perfect. Idk... cringe community but I feel like tweaking things here and there can make it somewhat bearable.",

It\u2019s just dumb because now it\u2019s an unnecessary hit to your own teammates confidence and we\u2019re giving up a bucket because it\u2019s 4v5 because you\u2019re on the ground.

The gap is knowing when you\u2019re open (a lot of shots that look like they should be contested are wide open), and knowing when you\u2019re not open. I average 27 ppg in rec on my 6\u20199 shooting big, 78 three 90 middy on 64% from three on that build by just knowing when I\u2019m open.
