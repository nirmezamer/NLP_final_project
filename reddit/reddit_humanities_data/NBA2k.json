They wanted everyone on the wings so they could run iso on every play. You basically just had to stand and hope for a catch and shoot. Needless to say we lost by double digits ",

            "See I love cutters its easy assists for me and if the lane closes theres usually an open 3.",
            "Yeah,  simple answer was to not pass to either of them. Real answer is there needs to be a voting system where the rest is the team can vote them out the game in real time or harsher penalties for bad, individual play.",
            "I like to play defense against my teammates if they are acting funny not passing the ball or have main character syndrome etc. Saves me from quitting and almost always works because now they have two defenders on them. Either they get the memo after a couple plays or we were going to lose anyways so might as well have fun with it while they chuck contested bricks.",
            "I woulda sold hard asl if ik we wasnt getting the win, pass to everybody besides from them but if I only had them to pass? Throwing that hoe to the stands!",

            "Inbound to someone else if you run into a similar situation.",
