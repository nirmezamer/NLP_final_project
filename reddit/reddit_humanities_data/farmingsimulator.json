This will keep self-promotion separate from the main feed. \n\n**How does it work?**\n\nYou are free to post your Youtube channel, Twitch stream, mods, etc. in the comments of this post. This does **not** mean that you can make these types of posts in the main feed, as they will still be removed. We ask that you use the provided template when posting in this thread. \n\nThe thread will refresh weekly (Friday morning USA time) to ensure that each creator gets equal exposure without being pushed out by larger creators or getting buried in the comments. Please keep in mind that comments made early friday morning will be wiped soon so it would be wise to wait until the new post is made so that your comment is visible for the week. \n\n**Example Template:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Name|Giraffe Sheep|\n|:-|:-|\n|Content Type|Mods|\n|Description|A description of your content or a specific piece of content|\n|Link|A direct link to your content (Note: For mods, only use trusted websites or it might get removed.)|",
