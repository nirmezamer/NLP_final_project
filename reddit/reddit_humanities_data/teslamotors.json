        "content": "As /r/TeslaMotors approaches three million subscribers, we wanted to sit down and take a moment to provide an update regarding our community on reddit, as well as open the floor to some questions from the community.\n\nUpdate part:\n\nWe have been working really hard in the background on dealing with the massive toxicity that has hit the Tesla/Elon subs.\n\nThe toxicity and hate hit an all time high during Elon\u2019s pay package shareholder voting event. We saw some of the weirdest patterns happening. We used a ban bot to put a big dent in the toxicity. When we turned on a ban bot for a weekend it showed us something we did not expect to see. We saw a HUGE amount of ban evading accounts. This told us that we were developing a larger issue with alt accounts than we thought we had. It showed that there were many (hundreds) of accounts that were ban evading. We have lost track of how many ban evading accounts we have banned again, and we\u2019ve been reporting them to reddit. Reddit does keep track of this but we are unable to go back in time to see the numbers. We should have kept track but that wasn\u2019t something we thought about at the time. We have been using the ban evading filter since the beta. It has gotten a few accounts here and there but nothing like we saw.\n\nWe know that doing prebans is not desirable. We had long talks with other subs that have done this. We have had long talks with Reddit admins, and are still talking to them.  Reddit admins have told us that they\u2019re \u201cgenerally not disallowed\u201d\n\nWe would like to tell you what subs we used for the bot to ban from, however, Rule 3 of the Moderator Code of Conduct, found here [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) states that we must respect our neighbors. We have been following this but other subs have not. We have seen other subs get spun up just to be hateful and to brigade and harass the Tesla/Elon subreddits\n\nWe do not care if you are a Tesla owner. We do not care about Elon\u2019s actions, unless it has to do with Tesla. If you want to talk about his actions then go to the /r/ElonMusk subreddit.  We DO care about you interacting with members of our subreddit in a polite, and respectful manner.\n\n**This week the ban bot was on for the longest time ever.** \n\nWe\u2019ve been able to deduce that it appears as though the moderator accounts of the Tesla subreddits are being watched closely.  /u/rcnfive\u2019s account in particular seems to be very closely monitored by hostile redditors, which has resulted in him having to be judicious in its use.\n\nWe are in the process of adding more moderators to the subreddits. Some of the moderators we\u2019ve added in the last few weeks initially confronted us about how toxic the subreddit was, so we asked if they wanted to help. We added them so they can see what we are dealing with. They\u2019ve advised us that it is very eye opening, and shocking, to see what we are removing. We are still looking for additional moderators. These new mods that we bring on will only have post and comment permissions. If you are looking to join, reach out via modmail.\n\nWe understand that Tesla, and its CEO Elon Musk, appear to be controversial topics today, however, we are not affiliated with Tesla in any way.  We are simply Tesla enthusiasts who wish to foster a community that can discuss Tesla, and their related products, in a respectful manner with one another.\n\nChat part:\n\nIf you have any questions, please leave them below. As we are volunteers, we will be slow to answer, as our personal lives sometimes get in the way. Automod will remove all comments on this post. Once we answer the question, or comment, we will approve it. We are doing this because we want to make sure this post stays on point and doesn't go straight to being toxic.\n\n* Moderators will answer questions, so long as doing so does not violate the health and safety of the community\n* Moderators will answer questions so long as doing so does not violate the Moderator Code of Conduct\n* Moderators will answer questions so long as doing so does not violate the Reddit Content Policy.",

            "Thanks for the update on the situation. It has definitely seemed weird recently, but I chalked it up to standard Reddit black or white upvote patterns.\u00a0",
            "Banning bots is always good.  Banning long time Tesla people who have negative things to say about Musk's leadership would be dangerous and turn the sub into an echo chamber (like r/elonmusk).  There is a legitimate overlap in the discussion of politics and how the brand is perceived.  You can love the company and criticize the wild political implications that are swirling around it and affecting all of us.",
            "Meanwhile during the final week of the Musk Comp package case vote, the TeslaInvestorClub sub mods were having anyone being even vaguely negative towards Musk...",
            "So many people are reporting being banned from the subs for stupid reasons. Y\u2019all need to chill.",
            "Is this update in response to the post that was made in the investors club sub?",
            "Since y'all are seeking feedback here's my suggestion. Other subs offer a \"Custom response\" option in the report menu to allow users to leave a custom report. Not everything fits neatly in to the 3 options we currently have.",
            "What can the community do to help with this issue?",
            "So glad to hear something is being done about this. The Cybertruck sub was completely swamped but now it\u2019s SO much better. I\u2019d be glad to help if you\u2019ll be applying similar measures. I spend way more time approving comments than removing them on the Cybertruck sub as most of the toxic accounts seem to have gotten the message.",
            "Isn\u2019t it kind of silly to say that you don\u2019t care about the ceos comments unless it\u2019s about the company\u2026.when so much of the company\u2019s success rides on valuation attached to his reputation and the demand he drives.",
            "Okay this might be a lot of questions so apologies in advance.\n\nAt times there seems to be ban waves or something similar happening where people are banned based on that they commented on some specific sub that is unwanted here regardless what they said in sub. Could the unwanted subs be clarified better if people want to avoid getting autobanned for interacting with them? Like I know those subs do have toxic users but do you have system or appeal process in place if false positives do happen? Not everyone is aware that triggers autoban. Today I have seen people complain elsewhere and their comment histories for the most part have seemed fine and not toxic at all and only reason seemed to have been that they commented on some toxic sub and comment was not even hate comment and was simply correcting misinformation. If user has demonstrated good behavior in this sub then does that affect how the user is judged if they end up interacting with unwanted sub? Like don't get me wrong but I'm bit scared what can I interact with and what not if it gets me banned by some automoderator that takes no appeals and Reddit sometimes does put these subs to my front page so I don't find it impossible that I accidentally comment on them."
