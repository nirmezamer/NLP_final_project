Hopefully I didn't miss anything.\n\n**Darth Malgus Deco**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0d369irfcvxc1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab50ae624d70f8c2b74ab9e9068ab379d960f994\n\n**Desperate Defiance**\n\nWe will be heading to Hutta with Sa'har in a mission to reclaim the holocron. [Story cutscene](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785733223827279946) shown during the stream.\n\nMission on Hutta will include new characters:\n\n[Adi Vonapa, leader of worker's rebellion](https://preview.redd.it/rssya7fwcvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd09f490a8af3e5c9dad2a7a0b668832943da88)\n\n[Rakit, another leader of the worker's rebellion](https://preview.redd.it/w52qkqixcvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc0fb7768568d1245e13b8ae4891883dbc0959a)\n\n[Yusinduu the Hutt](https://preview.redd.it/g4ccu9iycvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=473eeb75adab1fe28ee1711e12e3624b932b4f28)\n\n**Hutta Update**\n\nWith Desperate Defiance, they have done some graphical updates.\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785735370446950522](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785735370446950522)\n\n**Spring Abundance Festival**\n\nFinally finishing the seasonal activities calendar, we now have a spring festival. Starts with someone giving you a farm on Dantooine for absolutely no nefarious reason. Activities mentioned in the stream include:\n\n* Egg hunts\n* Farming\n* Baking pies\n* Eating pies\n* Electrocuting random fish while you sit on a blanket\n* Collecting orphaned animals for your farm\n* Dancing\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785736264743899348](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785736264743899348)\n\nRewards:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orsxrb8bevxc1.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c865ea816189e6d6975e9c025e6243d8c19ab2c0\n\n**Basilisk Prototype Venture**\n\nVentures are a new thing that are meant to be major undertakings for solo play (compared to something like acquiring the Wings of the Architect, but uhhh we'll see). As you complete missions you will improve B3-S1 (Besi) eventually unlcoking her final form as a full companion.\n\nProgression shown in the stream:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6y67csatevxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0afa0ce180f6965dd3ebb2f5ead606aae1d83d51\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785737944105415011](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785737944105415011)\n\n**PVP Season 6**\n\nPVP seasons are apparently getting some overhauls in terms of timing and length. A full post on this can be found on the forums: [https://forums.swtor.com/topic/934933-pvp-seasons-increased-to-16-weeks-long-with-75/#comment-9812918](https://forums.swtor.com/topic/934933-pvp-seasons-increased-to-16-weeks-long-with-75/#comment-9812918)\n\nRewards:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wis1gck1fvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee97e5031e4c807f595d8fd962f405459ea800f\n\nTitle: Pirate Hunter (I expect to see a lot of Zoros with this)\n\nText only Emote: Arr\n\nLegacy Title: Privateer\n\n**Cartel Market**\n\n[Armor of the Fallen Master](https://preview.redd.it/2kesxhxvfvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afa3d475e59010de8b3b8324723edf8ad873e9e)\n\n[Fallen Master Hair and Beard Customizations](https://preview.redd.it/yl7k855zfvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=db628bf1e75608f7ba5fe25be23c3086ddd12d4d)\n\n**Nar Shaddaa Nightlife**\n\n[High Stakes Squadron Helmet](https://preview.redd.it/uoxlwgd3gvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=13cad54aa6182566e75eb96ab70229c665b0911f)\n\n**PTS**\n\n7.5 will be on the PTS (soon).",

            "planet from swtor was already referenced in andor during the prison sentencing scene",
            "I mean they had the fight choreographers from the Kingsman and Daredevil on it. It\u2019d be hard for it not to be good but imo the fact that it implements so many actual Star Wars lightsaber combat moves while still felling grounded and gritty is impressive. You can see when Smilo Ren swaps from Form II to Form V or Form VII. Also his use of Trakata, Cortosis, and Dun M\u00f6ch were a nice addition. \n\nI don\u2019t like the show but I have to give props that this episode is a standout in Disney Star Wars, which I mean isn\u2019t saying much considering how many shitty duels and fight scenes we\u2019ve had since they through them in as flashy filler now when they have no idea what else to put in. It has weight to the story, there\u2019s immense plot relevance, multiple main characters die, and it\u2019s a turning point in the plot. \n\nNow I just want Smilo Ren\u2019s armor in SWTOR. He\u2019s imo how I view my Sith Warrior fighting, a literal beast in combat that has elegance and is smart. Juyo (Form VII) is all about channeling emotions to allow the acrobatics of Form IV while also having very strong and unpredictable, almost bestial, attacks. It\u2019s the quintessential Sith lightsaber form and I\u2019m glad to see it portrayed so well. \n\nAlso this is probably the first Disney Star Wars project to get the Sith right. They aren\u2019t just mustache twirling villains, they\u2019re obsessed with the Jedi and control. The Sith have a twisted social darwinistic view, thinking that those with power deserve to control those without and the Jedi restrict their freedom to do so. However just as the Jedi code ironically breeds fear of the dark side the Sith code makes the Sith slaves to their passions while claiming to free them. That\u2019s why so many Sith become sadistic madmen, they\u2019re enslaved to their deepest desires and thoughts most people would ignore."
