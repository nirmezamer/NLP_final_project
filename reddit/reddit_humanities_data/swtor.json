Hopefully I didn't miss anything.\n\n**Darth Malgus Deco**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0d369irfcvxc1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab50ae624d70f8c2b74ab9e9068ab379d960f994\n\n**Desperate Defiance**\n\nWe will be heading to Hutta with Sa'har in a mission to reclaim the holocron. [Story cutscene](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785733223827279946) shown during the stream.\n\nMission on Hutta will include new characters:\n\n[Adi Vonapa, leader of worker's rebellion](https://preview.redd.it/rssya7fwcvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd09f490a8af3e5c9dad2a7a0b668832943da88)\n\n[Rakit, another leader of the worker's rebellion](https://preview.redd.it/w52qkqixcvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc0fb7768568d1245e13b8ae4891883dbc0959a)\n\n[Yusinduu the Hutt](https://preview.redd.it/g4ccu9iycvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=473eeb75adab1fe28ee1711e12e3624b932b4f28)\n\n**Hutta Update**\n\nWith Desperate Defiance, they have done some graphical updates.\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785735370446950522](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785735370446950522)\n\n**Spring Abundance Festival**\n\nFinally finishing the seasonal activities calendar, we now have a spring festival. Starts with someone giving you a farm on Dantooine for absolutely no nefarious reason. Activities mentioned in the stream include:\n\n* Egg hunts\n* Farming\n* Baking pies\n* Eating pies\n* Electrocuting random fish while you sit on a blanket\n* Collecting orphaned animals for your farm\n* Dancing\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785736264743899348](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785736264743899348)\n\nRewards:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orsxrb8bevxc1.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c865ea816189e6d6975e9c025e6243d8c19ab2c0\n\n**Basilisk Prototype Venture**\n\nVentures are a new thing that are meant to be major undertakings for solo play (compared to something like acquiring the Wings of the Architect, but uhhh we'll see). As you complete missions you will improve B3-S1 (Besi) eventually unlcoking her final form as a full companion.\n\nProgression shown in the stream:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6y67csatevxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0afa0ce180f6965dd3ebb2f5ead606aae1d83d51\n\nTrailer: [https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785737944105415011](https://twitter.com/SWTOR/status/1785737944105415011)\n\n**PVP Season 6**\n\nPVP seasons are apparently getting some overhauls in terms of timing and length. A full post on this can be found on the forums: [https://forums.swtor.com/topic/934933-pvp-seasons-increased-to-16-weeks-long-with-75/#comment-9812918](https://forums.swtor.com/topic/934933-pvp-seasons-increased-to-16-weeks-long-with-75/#comment-9812918)\n\nRewards:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wis1gck1fvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee97e5031e4c807f595d8fd962f405459ea800f\n\nTitle: Pirate Hunter (I expect to see a lot of Zoros with this)\n\nText only Emote: Arr\n\nLegacy Title: Privateer\n\n**Cartel Market**\n\n[Armor of the Fallen Master](https://preview.redd.it/2kesxhxvfvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afa3d475e59010de8b3b8324723edf8ad873e9e)\n\n[Fallen Master Hair and Beard Customizations](https://preview.redd.it/yl7k855zfvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=db628bf1e75608f7ba5fe25be23c3086ddd12d4d)\n\n**Nar Shaddaa Nightlife**\n\n[High Stakes Squadron Helmet](https://preview.redd.it/uoxlwgd3gvxc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=13cad54aa6182566e75eb96ab70229c665b0911f)\n\n**PTS**\n\n7.5 will be on the PTS (soon).",

            "I like yellow Hutta though ",
            "Oh no, a PVP season armor reward I actually like and want? As a solo/story only player this will wreck me...\n\nThe Basilisk is amazing though, love it already"

Its happening constantly and after a while the game simply locks up and I have to force close it.\n\nHas anyone seen this before? driving me crazy."
