            "I don't really feel this is appropriate to share with most people in my personal like but this is a huge accomplishment I've been working toward my whole career; I crossed $1,000,000 net worth sometimes in June, just reviewed my roll-up and am at $1,021,525.62.\n\nIt's about $350k in 401k, $50k cash, and $600k in my personal brokerage accounts, with no debt.  I've been maxing 401k for several years now and almost all of my personal brokerage is $SPY, I also have another approx $500k of RSUs that aren't vested yet but don't count those as I haven't got them vested yet.\n\nI just wanted to share as this is such a huge personal milestone \ud83d\ude00",
            "Throwaway account for obvious reasons...\n\nThere is a high likelihood I will be receiving an additional $200k taxable income on top of my salary this year. 29 years old and still living at home (not for much longer).\nMy new/current income approx $150k/yr gross and that will continue steadily. \n\nAlready maxing out my Roth and have about $40k between cash reserves and investments. I'm a 1099 employee and take advantage of additional write downs each year on my taxes.\n\nMy two major fixed expenses each month are student loans: $483/mo and vehicle $516/mo (will own vehicle outright in 5 years)\n\nStudent loan balance: $61k at 4.62% fixed \nCar loan balance: $27k at 4.75% fixed\n\nLet's figure I walk away with an additional $120k net after taxes. My ultimate goal is to take the next step in my life and get my own place. I'm not against the idea of renting (approx $3,100/mo in my area plus utilities) for a few years because I will be in a position earning around $600k by then.\n\nIf I were to buy a house right now, I realistically I would want a $700k or so property just based on my own tastes/needs.\n\nShould I use that ~$120k to erase the student loan and perhaps use the additional $60k to more or less cover 2 years of rent? Keep all the loans (because I can afford to pay them as is now) and use the full amount as a down payment on a home?\n\nThis is not income I was anticipating this year so in my head, it's basically \"free\" money to me. Just looking for any thoughts/ideas on the best way to use it",
            "a huge accomplishment i made:\n\ni ended up in the ER twice this semester for various health problems and racked up a 18.6k medical debt (20 year old college student lol). after half a year of negotiating, fighting, insurance sending stuff back and forth, etc, i got the 18.6k reduced to 1.5k!\n\nnot only that, i applied to and received an emergency grant from my school to pay off that bill, and i paid everything off without spending a single penny of my own money! technically i have the emergency funds to pay off the 1.5k but my emergency fund isn't huge; it would've been a good chunk of my money, especially since i took almost 2k out to pay my taxes a couple of months ago.\n\nthis feels like a huge win because not only am i a poor first-gen immigrant on a full-ride to school, both times i went to the ER, i almost didn't go despite serious worries for my health. i was sure i wouldn't be able to afford the bills and wanted to ride out the terrible pain, but my friends managed to convince me it's better than i live and pay than die.",
            "Congrats!\n\nI came to post the same kind of update: I'm 39 and I just crossed $1mm net worth this past week.\n\nI grew up lower middle class. I learned my financial discipline on my own, and my parents used to daydream about being \"a millionaire.\" When I was younger, it seemed like a crazy idea to think that I'd get here, let alone before the age of 40.\n\nI get it -- a million isn't the same as it used to be, and it doesn't mean I'm suddenly in the 1% or that I can go buy a place in the Hamptons, but it still feels like a milestone I (and you, too) should celebrate!",
            "Your student loans are a lower rate *and* a lower monthly payment. There's no reason to pay them off over your car.\n\n\nBetween paying off your car or keeping it all, it's pretty close to a wash mathematically. If you can have 20% down and keep a healthy emergency fund, I'd pay down the car.\u00a0",
            "My thought was that over the next 5 years the car would be paid off anyway. The loan has something like 25 years left (I expect to pay it off sooner than that anyway but not within the next 5 years like the car would be) Over the long term the interest keeping the student loan would be significantly higher than the car",
            "If you're expecting 600k salary, won't you be paying down the debt anyway?\u00a0",
            "Oh yeah definitely. I'm very fortunate to be in the position that I am right now. Am I wrong in my thinking though that even over just the next 5 years, the interest accumulating on the larger student loan balance would be more than interest on the smaller car loan?"

As long as this doesn\u2019t happen frequently they\u2019re usually cool about it.\n\nYou can try the same with that loan, but who knows, might as well try.\n\nHonesty is the best policy. Also, wouldn\u2019t any loan rate greatly outpace the 1 time late penalties you might receive on these bills?",

            "Dog walking (Rover?) or InstaCart?\u00a0\nYou can try to get a loan from a local credit union.

I don\u2019t know how long it takes for them to start shutting off services, but it could be longer than you\u2019d expect.\u00a0\nHang in there!\u00a0",

I know my family has called about the electric bill before and they pushed the due date back a few days, no late penalties. If you have some free time, or try to make some free time and post on Facebook in groups asking if anyone has any yard work that need done immediately and all that type of stuff. Lots of people need yard tending to this time of year. \n\nToday is only the 21st so I would suggest looking in r/beermoney you might get approved for something with a few days and be able to scrap up a few bucks to help pay your bills.",

Used to do Xfinity Mobile and that was so terrible. $80/month for phone bill is a lot, there are other options out there!\n\nAlso, shop around for energy suppliers! My bills were $120/month for electric, but then I shopped around and now they\u2019re closer to $60-70. I think every state has a website that makes it easy to see what\u2019s out there side by side.

        "content": "I have just accepted a job on a tropical island. It pays about $75k. I have a fully paid of car that runs fine but needs. New catalytic converter. I will be moving to the island in a few weeks, and I can ship the car there for $3,500. The car is worth about $9k in good mechanical condition, but with it needing a new cat it's more like $7k. I could pay the money to ship it to the island and drive it until it dies, or I could sell it where I am now and use the money from the sale plus that $3,500 shipping fee towards buying a car (so about $10k budget, hopefully). The third option is to sell the car and just lease one on the island \u2013 no maintenance, no shipping, no selling it when I move off the island in a couple years. I am moving to this place solely for the job which is like a major stepping stone for me; I have no intention of remaining on the island after a couple years when the project is complete.\n\n\nThe margins between these all seem pretty thin, I don't think any option is significantly more expensive than another, it is really just a matter of paying a lump sum now for shipping or paying it over the span of 2 or 3 years leasing. Any input is welcome!\n\nEdit to address some common comments: the island is St Thomas USVI. Cars are a necessity there, the roads are not suitable for motorcycles or foot traffic. The car I have is a 2010 corolla with 140k miles. ",

            "If cars on the island are worth more (because every car has to be shipped there at some expense) then I'd say go ahead and ship yours and sell it at the end... *if* it is a make/model of car commonly found and therefore easily serviceable on said island. If they have a lot of Toyotas and a lot of mechanics who work on Toyotas and a lot of parts for Toyotas - don't ship a volvo there.",

            "Did this and there was an excessive amount of undercarriage damage presumably from seawater. Wish we had sold before moving and bought used there.",
            "I agree with buying or leasing on the island. There might be extra fees to bringing a car that you aren\u2019t considering, like import taxes or out of country inspections.",
            "OP have you confirmed pricing on what you could lease or buy on your budget on the island?  I've spent a bit of time on an island in the Caribbean and the prices for vehicles are inflated quite a bit over US prices.  \n\nAt one point I looked at doing something similar, make sure to consider any import fees the government might charge to allow you to register and license the vehicle.",
            "If you like your car, ship it. Get multiple shipping quotes. \n\nSt Thomas Cargo and Blue Ocean Transport are typically decent options. \n\nLook at the car market on the island to see what car you'd get if you don't ship. The used market there is full of cars in poor condition. The mountain is rough on vehicles even though they'll have low mileage. \n\nWhat job did you get, if I may ask?",
            "Definitely look at the market on the island. A lot of islands have really high prices, which could benefit you if you bring a vehicle to the island that goes up in value once you get there. Drive it while there, sell when you leave. MAY offset the shipping cost. But make sure you can get parts for that make/model.",
            "This is mainly a question for people who are more familiar with the place you're heading to. We don't even know what country it is. \n\nThe one option you should almost certainly rule out is leasing. If there is any uncertainty in the length of your stay then unwinding a lease early can cause significant issues. \n\nIn simple terms, keeping your car will cost you:\n\n$7,000 (sale price you don't collect)\n+2,000 (cat repair)\n+3,500 (shipping cost, hopefully that includes import duties)\n= $12,500\n\nIt sounds like you could spend a similar amount to get a similar vehicle when you get there. You'd also have the chance to see what your other options are (cheaper vehicle, public transit, etc). \n\nIf all of your numbers are correct then it's better to arrive there with $12,500 in your pocket then to arrive with a vehicle you may or may not need.",
            "Note that most island nations do not require catalytic converters on cars so that repair may not be required.",
            "I am betting the $3500 is port to port.  So that you still have to get the car to the port within the \"window\" of shipping.  And pick it up the same way.  If you use a service for that add in some more $s.\n\nThat is what I found when looking into this option.  Plus I had the issue with a foreign car (parts/maintenance) along with the hassles of getting it registered and insured.  So I passed (even though my company paid the first $3K too).\n\nIt is a lot of time and work.  Definitely not worth it for a car under $50K.  A $7K car that needs work?  Sell it and buy one there.  Less work, stress, time without a car waiting for the shipment.\n\nThen you would have to do that all over again when you move?  Do the easy route.  You already have a lot going on."

He is offering to get you out of a bad decision at his expense since he could make $1,250 a year just by letting that money sit in a HYSA.\n\nI'd be grateful, say yes, and pay him back as quickly I could.

I.e. what happens with the loan when you 2 happen to fall out, how impossible that might seem.  \nDo NOT depend on their goodness, write a fair agreement for when you might need it. I.e.: in the case of job loss payments can be halted for X period,  but interest would accrue. \n\nDO realize that loaning money from friends/family, especially amounts like that, will often (forever) change the relationship.
