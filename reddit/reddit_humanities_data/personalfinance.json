        "content": "In April 2021 the university I attended issued me a check for about $1700. I didn\u2019t think much about it, I thought it was refunds for excess scholarship, relief, and grants. Like each semester I receive a check a few months after the start date for refunds. In addition I thought a part of it was also for our parking pass refund which was never refunded since class was now online due to Covid. I graduated in May of 2021.\n\nTurns out the check was \u201cCME expenses\u201d which is something for medical students? I\u2019m not a medical student. The check was issued to my name and home address at the time. They said there was another student with the same name as me. The address part doesn\u2019t make sense, you would think they would cross verify this.\n\nNow I can definitely afford to pay this back but what the hell. 3 years later they reached out via student email and sent mail my parents home. Am I obligated to pay this back?\n",

            "I work in financial aid and often times when situations like this arise, especially when there's a balance due to school error, its worth it to ask if there is any institutional funding available to cover this balance. There may be, or may not be, but I know in cases where I screwed up for one reason or another I would absolutely try to cover with institutional funding if I could.",
            "Before you do anything else I would request more information, they should be able to demonstrate to you that this check was in fact incorrectly written and not as you said scholarship, grant or parking pass reimbursement. Universities are notorious at making mistakes like this, it's quite possible you were supposed to receive X but got Y instead.",
            "Sounds like negligence on their part, but to a certain point you're usually required to correct the error.\n\nThink this is more a r/legaladvice question, it would probably depend on what the statute of limitations for unjust enrichment or something like that is in your area.",
            "3 years is likely past the statute of limitations but check for your state. I would really just ignore them, if this is the case and see if they threaten anything related to your degree",
            "Depends on your state whether they can judicially collect from you.   They may not be able to but they may be able to withhold your transcripts if you don't repay",
            "I would guess it\u2019s just their accounting department making a Hail Mary attempt at a voluntary resolution for their error.  I\u2019d be inclined to ignore it with likelihood nothing further comes of it given the amount of time that\u2019s passed.  If it does,  you can deal with it then.",
            "This happened to me once and I just never replied. I never heard back from them again. I have a feeling errors do happen and they send it out to everyone who may have got extra money. I'm sure many people respond and those are the people they put their energy into collecting from. I never responded and never heard back from them ever. No marks on my transcript and it never appeared in my credit report. Of course, your results may vary.",
            "Without knowing your jurisdiction, nobody can give a proper answer.",
            "One big question is, did you reply?\n\nIf they haven't actually managed to get in touch with you and instead only contacted your parents, it may just go away on its own.",
            "Unless they reach out via certified mail or a summons I would not be reacting in any way."
