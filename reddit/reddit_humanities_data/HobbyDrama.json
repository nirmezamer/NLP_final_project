            "It's interesting when watching the Simpsons all the way through for the first time (as opposed to scattered out-of-order reruns) how religion was portrayed as a positive-to-neutral influence early in the show's run. For instance, Ned Flanders's obnoxious piety wasn't meant to be an indictment of Christianity but a facet of his life where he was just \"better than Homer\" because Flanders was so nice and perfect and had everything Homer wanted. It was only later that Flanders became a hypocritical right-wing Bible thumper. Likewise Reverend Lovejoy is usually the voice of reason rather than clueless and uncaring. \n\n\"Homer the Heretic\" where the moral of the story is essentially \"Homer should stop goofing off and go to church\" is probably the best example of this.",
            "Have any of y'all gotten super into a hobby from a post here on scuffles? I've got 11 dahlias going in pots on my balcony in various stages of growth (2 of which are already putting out a bunch of flowers!), and because I was already buying pots and dirt and plants, I've also got a tomato plant that's popped off suddenly and a few basil plants that are vaguely hanging onto life. All because someone posted a link to an article here about the behind the scenes drama of dahlia growers and breeders. \n\nOn a sidenote about my new hobby, I've never cared so much about the 10 day weather forecast in my life, or been so stressed about the weather at home while on vacation.

American Girl has been experimenting with releasing graphic novel variations of some books for the characters- the first was a \"Mystery Across Time\" titled \"Julie and the Blue Guitar\".

They'll be the first father-son duo to be in the NBA at the same time, and they'll be on the same team.\n\nThe more insidious story has to do with Kyle Filipowski. Kyle was a top prospect from Duke, so it was a surprise when he wasn't drafted yesterday during the first round. A draft analyst/insider reported that some teams were concerned about Kyle's relationship with his much-older girlfriend, which has estranged Kyle from his family. The social media sleuths figured out that his girlfriend (actually his fianc\u00e9e now) is 7-8 years older than him, and they started dating right around when he turned 18 (they have prom pictures together \ud83e\udd2e). Kyle's brother and his mom have also been on Twitter confirming that this fianc\u00e9e has been grooming him into Mormonism. And lo and behold, today, Kyle was drafted by the Utah Jazz, which is owned by a Mormon bishop.",

            "Does anyone know what the general fandom mood is now that the drama surrounding the Watcher streaming service incident has settled down a bit? Did they seem to lose a ton of fans or just a few? Does pretty much everyone seem soured on Shane and Ryan now? Was the drama so catastrophic that people don\u2019t really want to use memes with Ryan and Shane now, similar to how the use of John Mulaney memes dropped after the whole divorce (and possible cheating) debacle happened with him?\n\nI\u2019m curious because I\u2019ve been a casual fan of Ryan and Shane but not much more. I enjoyed Buzzfeed Unsolved quite a bit but never really viewed Watcher, aside from two mystery videos I tried out. So, when the drama all went down, I was slightly disappointed but not devastated or anything. I know Ryan and Shane had a big fan base on Tumblr, though",
            "Turns out kamierabi@GOD.app is getting a season two.\n\nFor reference this was the anime known for Yoko Taro's involved and being dogged by bad animation. Presumably because of said involvement setting high expectations and the stigma on all CGI anime. Leading to a middling exception."

        "content": "Strap in, this is going to be a long one with how many players are mentioned. But this is one of my favorite sagas in baseball. \n\nThere are many great sports rivalries. Ohio State vs Michigan, Frazier vs Ali, Duke vs UNC. But among all sports, the rivalries of baseball have tradition and history behind them, making them way more intense. The Yankees and the Red Sox first met in 1903, the Dodgers and the Giants first met in 1889, & the White Sox and the Cubs first met in 1906. Every team has their 1 or 2 rivals they loathe. One of those rivalries, which has never seen the same spotlight, is between the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh Pirates. And it all came to a head in 2019. \n\n\n##Let the Flames Begin\n\nBack in the infancy of what is now the MLB, the Pittsburgh Alleghenies defeated the Cincinnati Red Stockings 10-9 in the first ever meeting between the two teams. Due to the amorphous nature of the early baseball leagues, the teams didn\u2019t play each other from 1887 to 1890. But the teams have played uninterrupted since then. \n\n\nThere\u2019s not much to speak of in terms of the rivalry until the 1970s when the 2 Hall of Fame stacked teams would frequently meet in postseason clashes. The first was in the 1970 National League Championship Series which the Reds won in a 3 game sweep. The next time would be 2 years later, once again in the NLCS where it was even more dramatic. In the final game of the 5 game series, the Reds were down by 2 and down to their final 3 outs. They ended up winning the game on a wild pitch with 2 outs, ending the Pirates World Series dreams. 1975 was similar to 1970, as the Reds swept the Pirates once again, going on to then win the World Series against the Red Sox. 1979 saw the Pirates gain one back, as they swept the Reds and went on to beat the Baltimore Orioles in the World series. \n\nThe 80s were a down decade for both teams. But as fate would have it, they once again met in the 1990 NLCS. The Reds beat the Pirates in the series, 4 games to 2, and went on to sweep the Oakland A\u2019s to win. And until 2013, there\u2019s not much to talk about with these teams. They were placed into the same division, the newly formed NL Central, in 1993. But both teams saw a staggering amount of mediocrity. Bad management, bad ownership, players leaving town for better prospects, you name it. Despite typical rivalry games, the next time the teams saw a significant rivalry game was in the 2013 Wild Card game. The 2013 Pirates posted a pretty good record of 94-68 while the Reds snuck into the game due to a weak National League. The game saw the normally All-Star Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto completely melt down as the Pirates scored 5 runs in 4 innings while 40,000+ Pittsburgh fans mockingly chanted his name. The Pirates obviously won that game, but ended up losing to another divisional rival, the St. Louis Cardinals, in the National League Divisional Series. But once again, mediocrity struck for both teams, which honestly continues to this day, with both teams showing flashes of greatness but not being able to capitalize on it. \n\nBut why do these teams and their fans hate each other so much? This just seems like typical sports rivalry at this point. \n\n##This is Why\n\nThe cities of Cincinnati and Pittsburgh sort of have a rivalry outside of sports, but it all stems from sports. Only ~288 miles separate the once major American cities. Outside of baseball, the two cities saw short rivalries between their college football teams and their soccer teams, but most of the animosity comes from the professional football rivalry between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The football rivalry has seen some ugly moments which only fueled the animosity between the fans of the teams and the residents of the cities. With all of these factors together, anytime teams from Cincinnati and Pittsburgh meet up, there is bound to be some bad blood. \n\n##Pressure\n\nIt\u2019s 2019 and both teams suck. The Reds haven\u2019t had a winning season since 2013, while the Pirates had started declining in 2016. But the rivalry hadn\u2019t slowed down at all. \n\nOn April 7, the Reds visited the Pirates for a four game series. In the 2nd inning of game four, newly signed Derek Dietrich of the Reds [crushed a ball that landed in the Allegheny River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sozTWMRx7z8). Dietrich, being the big personality that he is, stood still for a good amount of seconds and admired his home run. As he crossed home plate, Pirates catcher Francisco Cervelli said something to him. Dietrich\u2019s next time up, Pirates pitcher Chris Archer intentionally threw behind him. \n\nIn baseball, one of the ways teams retaliate for things is by the pitcher intentionally throwing at, sometimes hitting, the batter when they come up to bat. It\u2019s a controversial move as it is dangerous.\n\nThe umpires immediately warned both teams, but Reds manager David Bell ran out onto the field to argue that Archer should be thrown out of the game for intentionally throwing at a player. And as is typical in baseball, the benches cleared and the players got in a big mass and stood around. This is pretty common for baseball \u201cfights.\u201d But most players aren\u2019t Yasiel Puig. \n\nPuig, who was also a recent acquisition for the Reds, had a reputation as a massive hot head. While everyone else stood around and yelled, Puig had to actually be held back by teammates. As it seemed like teams were going back to their benches, Puig broke out of the hold of a teammate and tried to swing at Cervelli, who had been yelling at him. But Puig was held back by another teammate.  [The whole \u201cfight\u201d can be seen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VOFyqWJ1j0) In the aftermath, 5 players and Bell were ejected from the game with Archer receiving a 5 game suspension, Puig a 2 game suspension, and Bell a 1 game suspension. \n\nThe next couple of months would only serve to heighten the drama. On May 27, Dietrich was once again hit by a Pirates pitcher, but no words were exchanged. His next at-bat, [Dietrich launched a home run and took his sweet time going around the bases.](https://cuts.diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2019/2019-05/27/018903a3-dd14ff00-f0c1e4c8-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4) 2 days later, Reds Third Baseman Eugenio Suarez was hit by a pitch on the hand. Some words were exchanged between Suarez and the pitcher, but didn\u2019t seem heated. Bell was once again ejected as he felt the Pirates pitcher should be thrown out for hitting Suarez. Outside of the teams, the Pirates announcers were equally as heated. One of the announcers, John Wehner, started suggesting that [Dietrich's grandfather would be embarrassed of him and would be rolling in his grave.](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/pirates-broadcaster-embarrasses-himself-with-comments-about-derek-dietrichs-grandfather/) Dietrich's grandfather had actually been a coach in the Pirates organization for many years. But now, the teams wouldn\u2019t see each other for 2 months. Surely things would settle by then, right?\n\n##Grudges\n\nJuly 30. The Pirates quickly took control of the game, having 7 runs by the 5th inning. Meanwhile, the Reds seemed to be languishing at the plate, only scoring 2. In the 7th inning, Pirates pitcher Keone Kela threw at Dietrich\u2019s head, which he later confirmed he did intentionally to \u201cprotect his teammates\u201d. As is the rule and because some players were yelling at each other, warnings were issued to both teams. In between the innings, first baseman for the Reds, [Joey Votto was seen arguing with Kela](https://cuts.diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2019/2019-07/30/69d64f11-68c0ff99-a310c5af-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4). The next time the Reds were up to bat, Puig had a pitch on the outside that the umpire called a strike. In anger and disbelief, Puig threw his helmet on the ground and stood off to the side for a bit while Bell argued with the umpire and was subsequently thrown out. In the top of the 9th on the first pitch, the Reds pitcher threw behind the batter and was thrown out of the game. Then out comes Amir Garrett to pitch for the Reds. \n\n##Here We Go Again\n\nSimilar to Puig, Garrett was known as a showboating, hot-head. As he takes the mound, he is visibly amped up. The umpire steps in to warn him about retaliating which Garrett seems to acquiesce to. Garrett then gave up even more runs which was accompanied by heckling from the Pirates dugout. Seemingly done with it, Garrett calls out the pitching coach and they converse for a bit with Garrett agitated and pointing at the Pirates dugout. As the coach turns to signal for a replacement pitcher, Garrett throws his glove on the ground and charges the Pirates dugout, immediately swinging, but missing, a Pirates player. There are many things that happen here. I highly recommend watching the [video of the brawl](https://cuts.diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2019/2019-07/30/9a35ba5e-526e1020-7007c37e-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4) and [the breakdown by Jomboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU-ESpiwV4o) to get the full picture, but I\u2019m going to do my best to summarize the hectic events that ensue. \n\n* [Amir Garrett is immediately taken down but continues throwing punches while on the ground. Fun fact, this photo was chosen as one of CNN\u2019s Pictures of 2019.](https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/presto/2019/07/31/PCIN/a988ba7b-1498-49ab-ac93-5b839413a2a0-073019RedsPirates_10.jpg?crop=3316,1865,x0,y18&width=1320&height=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp)\n\n* It looks like Jose Osuna was on top of Garrett at one point and unleashed a haymaker into the back of Garrett's head. \n\n* Archer accidentally tripped which allowed Garrett to climb on top of him and start throwing punches. As he stands up, Puig shoves him against the railing.\n\n* After shoving Archer, Puig goes after opposing pitcher Kyle Crick (who air humps at him for some reason), but Puig is held back by multiple people before any punches are thrown. \n\nAnd honestly, the craziest story of this fight. \n\n* Manager David Bell, who has been ejected from the game, comes rocketing in from nowhere and shoves the Pirates manager Clint Hurdle. Pirates hitting coach Rick Eckstein grabs Bell and takes him to the ground where the two wrestle for a bit. Reds pitcher Sonny Gray quickly jumps on Eckstein to pull him off. \n\n##The News\n\nEverything started to die down from there. Puig was yelling at teammates, but it is unknown exactly what was said and Bell seems to be praising Puig for his conduct in the fight. Youtuber Jomboy theorized that he was criticizing some of his teammates for not being as angry as some of them were. Pirates hitting coach Eckstein can be seen in the dugout with multiple scratches that drew blood. \n\nFunnily enough, before the brawl, it was reported that Puig had been traded to the Cleveland Indians. But all in all, 8 players were ejected from the game, 5 of those being from the brawl.\n\nFor the Reds discipline, Bell was suspended for 6 games, Garrett for 8, Reds pitcher Jared Hughes got 3 for hitting the batter in the 9th inning, & Puig was suspended for 3. \n\nFor the Pirates, Kela was suspended for 10 games, Jose Osuna for 5, Crick for 3, and manager Clint Hurdle for 2. \n\nIn addition to the suspensions, Pirates players Trevor Williams and Francisco Cervelli, as well as Reds players Joey Votto and Philip Ervin, were fined undisclosed amounts for their roles in the brawl. Garrett apologized the next day and said he felt like he was a showing kids a bad example of what it means to be a baseball player. \n\n##Future\n\nClint Hurdle was fired later in the year due to the recent performance of his team.\n\nDavid Bell is still managing the Reds. Although he was hired in 2018, Bell is now tied with Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson for most ejections for a Reds manger with 30. Sparky accrued those over 9 years whereas Bell has done it in 6. \n\nDietrich opted out of his contract in 2020 but was unable to find the same success anywhere else. He retired in 2024. \n\nPuig has bounced around various countries baseball leagues and has seen moderate success. It was revealed in 2021 that there were many lawsuits against him for Sexual Assault. \n\nGarrett, Kela, and Archer all posted poor numbers in subsequent years. Archer retired and Garrett and Kela have not found success with any teams they've signed with. \n\nAll the suspensions were served and the teams continued with their mediocrity with only the Reds making the playoffs in 2020 due to an expanded playoff picture.  While the rivalry will never fully cool off, it has never reached the absolutely ridiculous nature of those 4 months in 2019.\n\n**Author's Note Edit**: Thanks for reading. I love talking about baseball and although my Reds are mediocre, I'll always find a chance to talk about them. As for Cincinnati/Pittsburgh sporting moments, there was a similar clash between the Bengals and Steelers that could be it's own post. But that's for another time.\n\nEdit: Added info about Jose Osuna and why he was suspended. I couldn't find a source that mentions exactly what he did, but after watching the video again, I can make an inference.",

        "content": "Hi! Some absolutely glorious drama went down on Neopets earlier this year, and I've been champing at the bit to post about it. This isn't about the A-pea-calypse of Christmas 2023, however; this is something different.\n\nNeopets is a browser-based pet simulation game. It is *THE* virtual pet site. It wasn't the first of its kind, but it did set a precedent for virtual pet games. It walked so Webkinz, Mweor, Flight Rising, and all the others could run. If you were a kid or an edgy college student in the early noughties, you probably played Neopets at some point. (No, your pets aren't \"probably dead\". Neopets don't die, dicknips. Your Neopets are either still starving on your long-abandoned account or were wiped from existence in an account purge. Sweet dreams.) Founded in 1999, it continues to this day. Ostensibly the target audience is children, but in practice, most of the site's user base is nostalgic millenials and zoomers. Soon, Neopets will be celebrating twenty-five years of daily omelette distribution, obsessing over magic paint brushes, cake slices falling out of the sky, and spinning wheels to get your pets struck by lightning. Oh, and make that seventeen years of obsessing over UCs.\n\nOkay, so what's a UC, you say. This requires a bit of a history lesson. In 2007, Neopets went through a radical overhaul that changed the site layout to its current form, introduced the premium currency (Neocash), and made it possible to \"customise\" (dress up) your pets. To achieve this, almost all the pets were converted into standardized (and much more boring) poses and ported to Flash. I say almost, and that's where the seed of this drama is planted.\n\nYou see, pets with certain species/color combinations were not automatically converted to the new artstyle. For example, the [Faerie Ixi](https://wardrobe.jellyneo.net/assets/imgs/rainbow-pool/unconverted/ixi_faerie.png) (a pet that looks like a goat) would not be converted, whereas a standard [blue Ixi](https://pets.neopets.com/cp/ro3qcd6s/1/7.png) would be. You could choose to [convert your pet](https://pets.neopets.com/cp/dl4bczrw/1/7.png) if it wasn't changed. The pets that didn't get changed were dubbed Unconverted (UC). They couldn't be customised, nor would they ever show any emotions besides the default happy look, but they retained the classic artstyle.\n\nAnd they became *the* most coveted assets on the site, bar none. Everyone wants a UC. I want one, you want one, your mother's cousin's roommate wants one. The \"Pet Trading\" board is a neverending chorus of people screaming about what UCs they want. If you want UC pet traders to even glance in your direction, you'd better have a valuable pet to trade for and a multi-paragraph essay on why you'd be a good owner ready. I don't think actual pet shelters use this much scrunity when adopting out real animals. There's a tier system in place to judge the relative values of 17+ year old JPEGs. (\"You think your plushie Mynci is worth the same as my Faerie Draik? Get real!\") People have even gone so far as to hack into old, inactive accounts to steal UCs and sell them out for real money (which is against site policy), and people will risk getting their accounts banned forever just to get ahold of those precious, precious UCs. If this behavior sounds familiar to you, I must say: you're correct. UC traders were the original NFT bros. But they're not ready for that conversation.\n\nIn the nearly seventeen years since The Great Conversion, the UC situation has gotten so severe that players were begging TNT (The Neopets Team, aka our benevolent overlords) to do something. One common suggestion was to implement a feature to deconvert pets for a Neocash fee. It's two birds with one stone, we said: the move would absolutely print money, and it would also kneecap the UC black market. For years, TNT was all \"Yeah, we'll totally do that. Any day now! Sure...\u201dFinally, in January of 2024, TNT announced that they would do just that. They introduced the Styling Studio, a feature that would allow players to apply a skin of the unconverted artwork to their pet. It wasn't the same as actually unconverting the pet, but it would be a way to wear the nostalgic artwork on your account. Also, the mascot for the Styling Studio is a [nonbinary emo otter](https://bookofages.jellyneo.net/assets/imgs/characters/lg/9429.png), so the fanbase immediately loved them.\n\nStyling Supplies, the item that allows you to apply the skins, is bought with Neocash. It costs about $14 of real money, although it was released at a markdown price, and most players got free Neocash as part of a site event about two months before. So, many people were able to get the item without needing to pay actual money, or less than they would otherwise. Also, people who already owned a UC pet would get a free Styling Supplies to restore the original look of their pet. Both these details will be important later, so keep them in mind.\n\nAnd then the Fire Nation attacked. As anticipated, the neo-elite with their UCs did NOT, NOT, NOT like this change. If you go over to r/neopets, you can find [posts with screenshots](https://new.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/19dztbp/as_we_wait_for_the_rollout_i_present_the_uc/) of their angry chat board messages, including such gems as emo poetry about their crushed dreams, \"I have multiple grounds to sue for this\", melodramatic comparisons to historical monuments being destroyed, complaints about an \"important site feature\" being paywalled, and language that suggested the UC pets were \"survivors\" whom TNT was genociding. Yes, people really had the gall to claim that their pixel pets being changed was genocide, in the midst of several ACTUAL GENOCIDES happening in real life. And of course, we had the all-important useless petition against the change being made. No internet drama is complete without one. Many people threatened to quit the site or abandon their former UCs to the pound. (So it wasn't about the artwork after all, despite what they told us for years. They just wanted to feel superior.) Among the more level-headed users, the consensus was \"these people really need to go outside and touch grass.\"\n\nWell, despite the protests, TNT went forward with the change. On the 22nd, Neopets went down for maintenance to implement the big change. (We were warned ahead of time about this.) It was supposed to last until around 10:00 am US Pacific Time on the 23rd, but it went over by several hours. TNT must have underestimated how long it would take to implement the changes. Around 5:00 pm Pacific, the site finally came back up...running at a snail's pace from how many people were logged on. A lot of people joked that it seemed TNT had brought back another piece of early 2000s internet nostalgia: insufferably slow dial-up. Despite the insane lag, users bought the Styling tools they sought and applied the nostalgic art to their pets. Soon, r/neopets was replete with people celebrating having obtained their childhood dream pets at long last.\n\nAnd what of the former UC owners, suddenly without their bragging rights? Well, to no-one's surprise, very few of them actually quit the site like they promised. Most of them came crawling back on the 24th, quietly took their pets to the Styling Studio (or heartlessly abandoned them to the pound), and hit the boards to start pet trading again. Except now, since Styling Supplies turn into a token of a pet/species combination (e.g. apply it to your Ixi to turn it into a Faerie Ixi, and the Styling Supplies turn into a [\"Nostalgic Faerie Ixi\" token](https://wardrobe.jellyneo.net/assets/imgs/rainbow-pool/pet-styles/74851.png). Makes sense? I hope so.), their language had changed. Oh don't get me wrong, the Pet Trading board was still full of obnoxious clapping and red ball emoticons, but now they were trading \"tokens\" of certain pet/species combos. Yep, they're called tokens. And they're tradeable digital assets stored on a server, each of which is supposedly unique with a single owner...hmm. It really drove the point home about how this nonsense is hardly different from NFT bros getting mad when someone right clicks their ugly monkey JPEGs.\n\nWhat's the big takeaway from this drama, you may ask? I've wondered the same thing. I think it serves as a reminder of the impermanence of the internet. Your UC that you worked so hard for...or obtained through \"other\" means...could go from a status symbol to a whole lotta nothing overnight. It also works as a reminder that at the end of the day, you should be caring for Neopets because YOU want them, not because they're status symbols. Just like real pets, you know? I love my neopets dearly, even though (or perhaps because) the Pet Trading board wouldn't find them \"valuable\". I wouldn't trade them for all the UCs in the world. Don't be the guy having a meltdown on the neoboards because they can't act superior to the neo-proletariat anymore.\n\nStill, I would love to be a Mootix on the wall in a courtroom as someone explains to a judge why they deserve damages for a website changing how their pixel pet looks.  \n",

            "It\u2019s so funny to me how the items are actually called Nostalgic (Color) (Species) but the community absolutely latched onto calling them tokens and there\u2019s no going back. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if in the future they add the word \u201ctoken\u201d to the end of the item names since literally everyone refers to them as such.\n\nAnyway. Having lived this, all I gotta say is there\u2019s no drama like Neopets drama. I love this website and all the inane drama it brings out in people.",
            "This was wild (and fun) to watch go down. It's hard to explain to non players how much time and energy people put into trading UCs over the years. Like, for a dedicated chunk of players it was their main activity on the site, and they would spend months or years (and maybe even dollars!)* doggedly trading up the tier lists for their desired pet. I saw people considering quitting because they didn't feel like they had anything to do without UC trading. Can't fathom it tbh. I've been on Neopets for 21 years and never even considered trying to get into it even though I loved all the old poses. It was WAY too much of a commitment. I'm so happy with the new system.\n\n**OP mentioned pet theft briefly, but it was a huge problem. Having a coveted UC put a target on your back for hacking and black market real money pet sales. There were even issues with people trading for a pet that they didn't know had been stolen in the past, and then being frozen for being unknowingly involved!*",

Running a little shop and being able to insert your own custom HTML was super fun. And playing the flash games for account rewards. My account was frozen at some point for unknown reasons after I hadn't played in a while, and I don't think there was any sort of appeals process for that when I last looked into it 15~20 years ago. A shame, but good memories from my childhood!",
            "God this drama was so funny. I remember some people made a guild to boycott the change (which only had 12 people) but ended up buying the studio supplies anyways. There was also one person who was so mad they made a trade lot that called for TNT to fire who thought up the nostalgic tokens in their WL. After the conversion I saw them looking to trade their royal pet tokens for a ridiculous amount of studio supplies ($100+ amounts). Wish I got screenshots of the guild and trade lot.  \n  \nI was so happy when they made this change. I was paranoid about doing certain things with my main pet since she was UC but now I don't have to worry about accidentally converting her :D"

        "content": "# [The X-Men.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di6DocEkruk)\n\nYou probably know them.\n\nFor the uninitiated: *The X-Men* is an American superhero franchise that follows a team of \"mutants\", average people who suddenly gain superpowers through genetic mutations, trying to protect a world that hates and fears them. It started publication in 1963 through Marvel Comics, and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. In the mid-70's, writer [Chris Claremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Claremont) took charge of the X-Men and turned them from a team of five mutants into an international team with a rotating cast. Under Claremont, the X-Men would create some of the most iconic comic book stories of all time. By the 80's, the X-Men exploded into a massive multi-media franchise that changed the face of the comic book industry.\n\nBut in 2019, the X-Men franchise was in a state of disarray.\n\nThis is the story about the House of X, how it saved the X-Men, and how it fell apart.\n\nWelcome... to **The Krakoa Era!**\n\n# Krako-What?: How The X-Men Broke\n\n\"The Krakoa Era\" refers to a period of the X-Men comics from 2019 to 2024 that explored the concept of a mutant nation-state. It's called \"The Krakoa Era\" because the mutant state is called Krakoa, and is located on a sentient island also called Krakoa. While mutant nation-states have been done before, like with Genosha, what made the Krakoa Era stand out was how it completely retooled the X-Men franchise into a utopian, queer-friendly, solarpunk sci-fi franchise. Krakoa wasn't just a nation-state; it was heaven on Earth built by mutants, for mutants.\n\nBut first, a little context why Krakoa was needed in the first place.\n\nYou can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/wgvgob/comic_books_meet_the_inhumans_the_long_sad_stupid/), so I'm going to keep it simple. [In 2009, Disney bought Marvel Comics](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/media/01disney.html), but did not get the film or TV rights to a vast majority of X-Men characters. That honor belonged to their competitor, 20th Century Fox. So Disney decided to side-line the X-Men with another cast of characters called the Inhumans, whose film/TV rights they did own.\n\nWhat followed was a slog of content from 2012 to 2017 that saw the X-Men comics (and films) release stinker after stinker.\n\nIn 2017, the tide began to change. Marvel would announce the \u201cResurrXion\u201d relaunch which promised a back-to-roots approach by getting rid of the Inhumans. However, this would only last for two years.\n\n[Because Disney bought Fox and its X-Men license in 2019.](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/27/18280941/marvel-fox-disney-merger-x-men)\n\nDisney could finally use the X-Men franchise to its full extent.\n\nWhat this called for was a fresh start. And a man named Jonathan Hickman had an idea.\n\n# House of X (2019): Fixing X-Men\n\n[In 2019](https://youtu.be/h_hfjRpXW-s?si=gXaxngC4BstdOkhD), it was announced that all X-Men comics would be canceled and that the entire line would be relaunched under [Jonathan Hickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Hickman). At this point, Hickman was a superstar. He was hot off of finishing Secret Wars, an event comic that capped off a multi-year saga that began in *Fantastic Four* and stretched into *The Avengers*. This run of comics was so influential that several characters from these comics appeared in *Avengers: Infinity Wars* and *Avengers: Endgame*. It's an understatement to say fans were excited.\n\nHickman's first comic would be a 12-issue series called [House of X and Powers of X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuu9GThyi4Q) (shortened to HoXPoX from here out) with Pepe Larraz and R.B. Silva as its artists. HoXPoX would be the only X-Men comic for 3 months. Afterwards, the rest of the comic line would be launched. Marvel teased that this was because HoXPoX so revolutionary that everything else had to wait. Hickman wasn't just heralding a relaunch, he was changing everything about mutantkind. In fact, Hickman had an entire three-year epic already planned out.\n\nTo top it all off, [Hickman would also have creative supervision over the entire X-Men line ](https://aiptcomics.com/2019/07/20/were-going-in-a-radically-different-direction-jonathan-hickman-talks-the-new-era-of-dawn-of-x-at-sdcc/)(known as \"The X-Office\"). He would be managing a room of writers and artists all collaborating together to mold a new era. He'd handle the main story, while other writers would come in to flesh out details, spin-out stories, and contribute to the overarching narrative. For comics this was never done before. Sure, comic creators talked and pitched to each other, but never all at once to develop an entire, cohesive line with a multi-year plan.\n\nWhat Hickman was proposing was a permanent, collaborative, on-going creative team for all X-Men comics directed by one person. An X-Men writer's room.\n\nThen HoXPoX came out.\n\nWithout spoilers, HoXPoX covered both the founding of Krakoa, and the secret past of mutantkind. It's a very dense comic that goes through thousands of years of history.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n* Everyone was back and accounted for. That really obscure character you like? They're on Krakoa now. And they're back with their powers too! And if they were dead? Well, they got better! ~~Clone characters not included for narrative and practical reasons.~~\n* Everyone had a fresh start. Part of the deal with Krakoa was that if you're a mutant, you get Krakoan citizenship and you get criminal/legal amnesty for past crimes. All mutant villains had their pasts forgiven. Everyone was welcome on Krakoa to work together to a brighter future.\n* The X-Men solved death. Using \"The Resurrection Protocols\", The X-Men could now revive any mutant with their body, memories, mind, and soul fully intact in two days thanks to five mutants working together. Any character that was dead is back. Any character that could die could be back in a page or less.\n* A new mythology. The secrets past and futures alluded to colonies of mutants in the ancient past, in the far-flung future, in space, and in other dimensions. Mutants were made an evolutionary inevitability anywhere life existed. But even in the most successful timelines, mutants fought advanced machine intelligence. Mutants were no longer fighting bigots, but also preparing for war against machine life.\n* New aesthetics. Krakoa was a limitless resource, so all technology came from the island's bio-organic sources. For example, instead of a gun, [it was a tree gun on Krakoa](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/War_Mitten).  In order to bring this new aesthetic to life, Hickman and [Tom Muller](https://www.hellomuller.com/) standardized the X-Men's graphic design across all comics. They made an entirely new language font for mutants, inserted [\"data pages\"](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/tom-muller-designing-evolution-x-logo) in every issue, and homogenized all logos and title pages.\n* New culture. [Krakoa was a utopian, post-scarcity society.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PvRyYk524A) A government called The Quiet Council is formed to manage and protect Krakoa. They would manage the day-to-day economics and politics of Krakoa while everyone else got to enjoy paradise. Muntankind could now form a cultural identity without fear of human violence, oppression, or judgement.\n* New world order. Krakoa strong-arms the entire world into recognizing their legitimacy. Overnight, Krakoa became an impenetrable fortress and an overwhelming superpower. All nations had to capitulate to their demands. The X-Men no longer peacefully lived with humanity, they peacefully ruled over it.\n\n[To Hickman, these changes would fix everything wrong with the X-Men.](https://www.xplainthexmen.com/2022/01/358-giant-size-special-10/)\n\nAnd it sold like crazy. *House of X* #1 [wound up selling 185,000 copies](https://www.cbr.com/sales-chart-july-2019-house-of-x-powers-of-x/), a monumental achievement in the modern era. It maintained over 100,000 sales for its entire run. For context, most books struggle to crack 50,000 copies.\n\nCritically, these changes were met with [universal acclaim.](https://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/trades/reviews/marvel-comics/house-of-x/house-of-x--powers-of-x) For once, after decades of mistreatment, the X-Men felt like they were succeeding again. Critics thought the idea of a new mutant nation opened exciting new possibilities.  Fans loved it because it fixed long-term continuity problems by just getting everyone in one place. As for newbies, HoXPoX needed surprisingly little knowledge in advanced because so much was changed. Only cursory knowledge of key characters was needed.\n\nHoXPoX was a definitive statement. The X-Men were back. It was going to explore the limits of what the X-Men could do, how they could cooperate, and how they could thrive. What challenges would they face as a nation? What *could* even challenge them? How far could you push this concept?\n\n# Powers of X (2019): Fixing Comics\n\nAlongside the reboot, the X-Office wanted to tackle another problem: getting people to read comics.\n\nComics, at least in America, are published on a weekly basis. Each comic series has at least one issue come out every month. A common complaint is that comics are difficult to get into because there are multiple comics running at once, some with overlapping stories and crossovers. If you want to follow any single storyline you might have to buy issues to multiple comics every week. Most comics have gotten around this by collecting issues and reprinting them into cheaper trade paperbacks, hardcover books, or omnibuses. But for the X-Men, which usually has multiple series running at once, a reader can end up with multiple trades of multiple different series all trying to tell the same story. This, obviously, makes it very confusing and expensive for a new readers to jump in. Where do you start? What do you read?\n\nHoXPoX solved the \"starting point\" problem. You start at HoXPoX.\n\nBut what about the other comics?\n\nHalfway through HoXPoX it was announced [six new X-Men books](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/marvel-october-november-2019-solicits-jonathan-hickman-dawnofx/) would be launched after the event: *X-Men*, *X-Force*, *Excalibur*, *New Mutants*, *Fallen Angels*, and *Marauders*. This wave of comics were called the \"Dawn of X\", and would explore how Krakoa functioned.\n\nHickman would write the *X-Men* flagship book, while writers [Gerry Duggan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Duggan_(writer)), Tini Howard, Bryan Hill, Ed Brisson, and Benjamin Percy would join the X-Office to write the other books. Each of these comics would focus on a different aspect of Krakoa life. For example, *X-Force* would explore Krakoa's black-ops military force while *Marauders* would explore Krakoa's piracy network to rescue mutants.\n\n[Finally, a new publishing plan was revealed.](https://comicsxf.com/2019/10/22/marvel-announces-dawn-of-x-vol-1-trade-paperback/) The X-Men comics wouldn't just be collecting their comics into trade paperbacks for individual series, but that they would be printing a trade series for the entire era. So instead of only selling a trade collecting *X-Force*, they would also sell [a trade series that collected all six comics](https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-X-Vol-Jonathan-Hickman/dp/1302921568/147-7366470-7713840?psc=1) in chronological order. Interested fans that want to get into the Krakoa Era just had to follow one trade line. And when they catch up, they can then buy the weekly issues.\n\nThis was going to be the big secret weapon of the Krakoa Era. Not only a full narrative reset, but a new publishing restructuring as well. The X-Men would now be printing anthology books, except as monthly, fully-colored comics that have a unifying, coherent story. This is why Hickman's writer's room was revolutionary. The X-Men line needed cohesive direction that could make all six series gel together as one narrative in a trade.\n\n# Dawn of X (2020): X Of Swords\n\nThen, Bryan Hill, writer of *Fallen Angels*, [decided to leave the X-Office](https://twitter.com/bryanedwardhill/status/1197536359700844545).\n\nBryan Hill was offered a television writing job, so he quickly wrapped up *Fallen Angels* to go peruse that career. Surprisingly, this was a smooth transition... [because Fallen Angels was a pretty bad book](https://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/fallen-angels-(2019)). However, it already felt like cracks were starting to form.\n\nMeanwhile, the comics were on a hot streak. Fans were clamoring for more Krakoa. And Marvel was more than happy to oblige.\n\nThere was a new flurry of announcements. Hickman announced five issues called *Giant-Size X-Men*. A *Wolverine* comic was announced. A *Cable* comic was announced. A *Hellions* series was announced. An *X-Factor* comic was announced. A mini-series called *X-Men/Fantastic Four* was announced. And the first crossover event of the Krakoa Era was hinted at: *X Of Swords*.\n\nBut this is 2020, so in March, everything shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The X-Men wouldn't resume publication until July. In the meantime, the X-Office was hard at work... and plans changed drastically.\n\n[In August, it was announced the *X Of Swords* would go from a 9-issue crossover to a 22-issue crossover series.](https://www.gamesradar.com/x-of-swords-creation-kicks-off-the-biggest-x-men-story-since-house-of-xpowers-of-x/) And yes, all 22-issues were necessary to read. The community side-eyed this announcement. 22 issues is a hefty buy-in to ask for, even if this was the pandemic and people had time to read all the issues. Expectations began to inflate. Whether the X-Office wanted it or not, it was setting the tone for the rest of the X-Men line.\n\n*X of Swords* released in September to... [mixed results](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52851829).\n\nUnlike HoXPoX, *X of Swords* has a really complicated plot. In its broadest sense, *X of Swords* is a story about Arakko, a mutant colony from the ancient past that was trapped in a hell dimension called Amenth, trying to invade Earth. However, through a bunch of weird sci-fi fantasy politicking it turns into a medieval-like tournament in a trans-dimensional realm called Otherworld. *Yeah, it's a lot.*\n\nGenerally, the criticism of *X of Swords* was that it was bloated; the first half was well-received, but the second half failed to stick the landing. Criticism was thrown at co-writer Tini Howard struggling with the Otherworld plot line, characters, and setting, while Hickman was criticized for his liberal use of info dumps about Arakko and Otherworld. At its best, you were reading a sweeping fantasy of heroes performing mythic feats. At its worst, it felt like reading a *Dungeons and Dragons* Handbook.\n\nThen came a new wave of comics: \"Reign of X\", which would focus on how the X-Men ruled.\n\n# Reign of X (2021): The X-Men Break Again\n\n*X of Swords*, because it was a crossover event, brought an unspoken aspect of the X-Men line into sharp focus: the quality of the comics.\n\nHoXPoX was a masterpiece, but the comics that came after were not. Quality ranged wildly between comics. Howard's [*Excalibur*](https://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/excalibur-(2019)) and Hill's [*Fallen Angels*](https://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/fallen-angels-(2019)) were heavily criticized for their writing. Meanwhile, Hickman's [*X-Men*](https://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/marvel-comics/x-men-(2019)) was being seen as a new foundational pillar to the franchise. [Despite this, sales for the X-Men continued to be strong through X of Swords.](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/x-of-swords-slashes-bleeding-cool-bestseller-list-28th-september-2020/)\n\nSo Marvel wanted even more X-Men.\n\n[While Hickman didn't.](https://ew.com/books/inferno-jonathan-hickman-last-x-men-comic/)\n\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Hickman would be leaving the X-Office. He would leave behind his outlines and ideas for the X-Office, but beyond that, he was washing his hands of X-Men. The reason given for Hickman's departure was that he \"wanted to move on to the second act\" after *X of Swords*, while the rest of the room \"wanted to explore the first act more\". What this means exactly is anyone's guess.\n\nIn the meantime, the X-Men were having a party: [The Hellfire Gala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwNz6azm1ZE).\n\nThe Hellfire Gala is basically the comic book version of [The Metropolitan Gala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala). Superheroes across the world were invited to a grand party on Krakoa and were encouraged to show up in their fashionable best. Unsurprisingly, it was also another crossover event. [This event was more poorly received than X of Swords.](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57796305) The Hellfire Gala was mostly fluff of seeing characters dress up and party. But on the other hand... you got to see your faves get drunk, kiss, and be fashionable. [EW even got in on the action by making an article critiquing the dresses](https://ew.com/books/rating-the-best-and-worst-outfits-x-men-hellfire-gala/). However, what cemented the Gala as worthwhile was an issue called *Planet-Size X-Men*, a comic that would radically shift the X-Men once again.\n\nAfterwards, the *X-Men* flagship comic was handed to Gerry Duggan, and the year closed out with the last Hickman X-Men comic: *Inferno*.\n\nOf course, Hickman's absence was immediately felt.\n\nThe range of quality worsened without Hickman's guidance. In the span of a year, the X-Office announced and cancelled 8 titles: *X-Factor*, *Excalibur*, *X-Corps*, *Way of X*, *Children of the Atom*, *Cable*, *Hellions*, and *S.W.O.R.D.* All failed to reach 12 issues, or a year of publication. ~~Except for Hellions which ended after 18 issues.~~\n\nSome of these titles, like *Excalibur* and *Way of X*, would be reborn into new titles. Most were just forgotten, such as *X-Corps* infamously only getting 5 issues. Or *X-Factor* [getting cancelled with no warning](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/leah-williams-on-x-factor-10-being-rewritten/) so it could be made into a mini-series: *The Trial of Magneto*. Unsurprisingly, this is where the most people burned out. What started out as a line of six cohesive comics suddenly ballooned into a dozen comics of half-baked ideas. *X of Swords* shook the confidence of fans, but they could at least stick with knowing the X-Office had a plan. *Planet-Size X-Men* showed they had one. But with Hickman gone... what was the point? Was there a plan anymore?\n\nIt also made the trades a nightmare. Remember how the X-Men titles were going to be collected chronologically in trades? For easy collecting? That was out of the window by \"Reign of X\".\n\n\"Dawn of X\" was already stressing the trades when it added *Hellions*, *Wolverine*, and *Cable* to the line-up. The \"Reign of X\" wave made trades pointless. For example, if you read *Reign of X Vol. 1*, which had *S.W.O.R.D.* #1 in it, you had to wait until *Reign of X Vol. 5* to read *S.W.O.R.D.* #2. It was beyond impractical. Even the title of the trades kept changing. The trades were originally called *Dawn of X*, but then became *Reign of X*, [and then were later re-titled Trials of X.](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/marvel-comics-relaunches-reign-of-x-as-trials-of-x/)\n\nAs for crossover events like *X of Swords* or The Hellfire Gala? They were collected into completely separate trades. So you would have to read *Dawn of X*, *X of Swords*, *Reign of X*, *Hellfire Gala*, *Inferno*, and then *Trials of X* to follow the Krakoa Era. Whatever cohesion that existed was obliterated at this point.\n\nGerry Duggan was also discovered to be a different beast from Hickman. Hickman can be criticized for his slow, glacial plotting, and often dull characters, but it always felt thematic and purposeful. Whatever ideas he brought up would always be explored later. Duggan was more action-oriented and drifted towards big, splashy ideas. He could come up with impressive scenes, like >!Mars being terraformed!< in *Planet-Size X-Men*, but struggled with themes, characters, and relationships.\n\nThe \"Reign of X\" closed out with another event *X Lives of Wolverine and X Deaths of Wolverine*. It was about how Wolverine is the coolest guy ever. More importantly, it was used to springboard the next line of comics, \"Destiny of X\".\n\n# Destiny of X (2022): Events Galore\n\n\"Dawn of X\" was about how Krakoa worked, \"Reign of X\" was about how the X-Men ruled, and \"Destiny of X\" was about crossover events.\n\nThe X-Office went through a pretty drastic re-structuring at the start of \"Destiny of X.\" The X-Office would now consist of: Gerry Duggan, Benjamin Percy, Tina Howard, Vita Ayala, Steve Orlando, Si Spurrier, Kieron Gillen, and Al Ewing.\n\nThe last two writers were godsends. [Kieron Gillen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Gillen) had previously written the fan-favorite *Uncanny X-Men* comic back in the early 2010's. [Al Ewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ewing), on the other hand, was one of the \"Marvel Architects\" re-crafting Marvel's fictional cosmology, and he just finished his career-defining *The Immortal Hulk* comic. Gillen would write *Immortal X-Men*, a comic following the political drama of Krakoa's government, and Ewing would write *X-Men: Red*, a comic exploring Arakko.\n\nUnlike the previous comics, *Immortal X-Men* and *X-Men: Red* felt like they delivered on the promises Krakoa initially offered. They were comics about the X-Men dealing with complicated sci-fi politics and weird sci-fi threats. In *Immortal X-Men*, Gillen was great at digging into the complex histories between Krakoa's leaders and making all of them feel unique. Heads of Krakoa's government were backstabbing each other over petty grievances while trying to deal with threats to the state, both internal and external. Ewing's *X-Men: Red*, on the other hand, created a dense alien mythology and delivered excellent fights that showcased the best and strongest of mutantkind. He made Arrako feel like a living, breathing alien society with a rich history. By the end of the era, both *Immortal X-Men* and *X-Men: Red* were considered top-tier comics.\n\nHowever, this was also the era of a million events and spin-offs. In the span of a year, the X-Men line had three crossover events, eleven limited series, and thirteen one-shots. All three crossovers, annoyingly, were important to the overarching X-Men plot, but all for different reasons.\n\nThe first event was *A.X.E.: Judgement Day*. This was a crossover event between Avengers, X-Men, and the Eternals, where aliens came to judge mankind and mutantkind for... space reasons. While the event was steeped in the complicated lore of Marvel's cosmology, this was seen as a strong event. The \"judgements\" were personalized to each character, so it was able to explore characters in meaningful ways. The events from *A.X.E.* would tie-in mostly with *X-Men: Red*.\n\nThis was immediately followed by another crossover called *Sins of Sinister*. The event was localized to the X-Men titles and followed stories that happened in *Immortal X-Men*. Basically, a bad guy called Mister Sinister is causing problems and the X-Men have to stop him. This event, while bloated, wound up advancing the story of Krakoa in significant, meaningful ways. Things mentioned all the way back in HoXPoX were finally evolving under Gillen.\n\nThe final event was *Dark Webs*, a crossover event with Spider-Man. This affected the X-Men comics the least, as it was about Spider-man's and the X-Men's clone drama. However, it did bring back Madelyn Pryor and made her a functional, recurring character again.\n\nUnsurprisingly, all these events made the X-Men harder and harder to follow-- so Marvel stopped trying. As of now, no new trades after \"Trials of X\" have been announced. The dream of an on-going anthology was dead. [Except in France for some reason.](https://www.amazon.com/Destiny-X-T26-Joshua-Cassara/dp/B0CHY3M5TD) Instead, Marvel went back to printing individual trades for each book, and a bigger hardcover omnibus collecting the X-Men's numerous events.\n\nWhich brings us to the end.\n\n# Fall of X (2023): Closing An Era\n\nThe \"Fall of X\" wave is, obviously, about how Krakoa falls. The end wasn't a surprise to fans. Ever since HoXPoX was announced, Hickman said he had a beginning and an end to the Krakoa Era. In his words, as far back as 2019, were: [\"The cardinal rule beyond that is at the end of the day, after you\u2019ve torn up the playroom and scattered all the toys, you put everything all back on the shelf. Don\u2019t be an a\u2014hole and leave a mess.\"](https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/jonathan-hickman-previews-house-of-x-powers-of-x/)\n\nWhat was a surprise was how it was happening and how quickly it would begin. [Fall of X was announced in October 2022](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comics-x-men-crossovers-sins-of-sinister-fall-of-x-2023), the event started only two months after Sins of Sinister ended. This caught almost everyone off-guard. Fans knew Hickman's story had to come to an end. What they didn't expect was that it meant an end to Krakoa as well. The majority of fans liked Krakoa and were starting to expect it as the new status quo. [It became a common forum talking point whether fans wanted Krakoa to stay or go](https://community.cbr.com/showthread.php?171597-A-Month-Away-For-The-End-of-The-Krakoan-Age-of-X-Men), with fans often siding with \"stay\".\n\nThe next relaunch would focus on a back-to-roots approach, called [From The Ashes](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/x-men-summer-2024-titles-creative-teams). The X-Men would be scattered across the world and re-discovering how to navigate a world that hates and fears them once again. Instead of having one big mutant community, like during Krakoa, it would be focusing on a micro-communities forming across the world. It was also re-focus the X-Men back to its para-military, similar to the 00's films. The relaunch would include writer [Gail Simone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Simone), known for *Secret Six*, *Wonder Woman*, and for coining the term/trope [\"fridging\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_refrigerators).\n\nFan reaction was mixed. The community saw this as Marvel's attempt to cynically reset the X-Men back to something that would match the X-Men's inevitable appearance in the Marvel movies. This conspiracy was further bolstered by how Marvel were constantly teasing the 90's and 00's era X-Men in their newest movies. To fans, this felt like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Hickman's experiment worked. What wasn't working was Marvel's editorial.\n\n\"Fall of X\" kicked off with *X-Men: The Hellfire Gala* #1 (2023). Without getting into spoilers, Ms. Marvel/Kamala Khan was a mutant now (that's a whole drama in of itself) and the X-Men were scattered. It also began the X-Men's most confusing era.\n\nThe X-Men line was now drastically cut down to five titles: *X-Men*, *Immortal X-Men*, *X-Men: Red*, *X-Force*, and *Wolverine*. Several mini-series were announced in addition to help clean up lingering plotline and character arcs. Finally, Krakoa Era's last event was announced: *The Fall of The House of X and the Rise of the Powers of X* (referred to as Fall from here on out) written by Gerry Duggan and Kieron Gillen respectively. Much like how HoXPoX opened the era, Fall would close it all out. Afterwards, Marvel promised an end to anything and everything Krakoa. It was all being shoved back into the toybox.\n\nThen, as the X-Men comics ended... they started to guest in other comics.\n\nFor example, Emma Frost was now a leading character in *Invincible Iron Man*, and Wolverine was in *Ghost Rider*. There were plot reasons as to why this happened, but it didn't make it any less confusing to readers.\n\nLike \"Destiny of X\", there was also a glut of mini-series (thirteen to be exact) that ranged from important to complete fluff. Some were absolutely essential, such as *X-Men: Forever* explaining key developments to Fall. The pacing, as a consequence, became either glacial or lightning-fast. The core comics had 12 issues to fill while mini-series had handful of issues to closed out plot points built over years.\n\nFall received similar pacing criticism. Matters weren't helped by how major plot points in Fall were being first introduced in other mini-series. The common criticism was that Duggan's Fall was both too fast and too slow. Plots had no time to breathe, partly because it was now trying to pull together the storylines of nearly 500 issues across 4 years. Meanwhile, Gillen's half in Rise got mild praise for expanding  into the mutant-machine timelines, but was also criticized for his lightning-fast pacing. In the end, neither Fall nor Rise felt entirely connected to each other. It was two writers closing out their own stories on their own terms with completely different qualities.\n\nThe Krakoa Era would end on May 22nd, 2024 with two issues: *Rise of the Powers of X* #5 and *X-Men: The Wedding Special* #1. The X-Men franchise was then handed off to Gail Simone in *X-Men* #35/*Uncanny X-Men* #700 on June 5th, 2024, in an oversized issue that saw Chris Claremont, Al Ewing, Gerry Duggan, and Kieron Gillen all write their final scenes on Krakoa. It was a bittersweet close.\n\nFrom The Ashes would launch in July 2024.\n\n# The Consequences Of The First Krakoan Age\n\nSo what did the Krakoa Era do and why did it fail?\n\nThe Krakoa Era succeeded at redefining the X-Men. The X-Men truly felt like a truly sci-fi culture you could live in, thanks to the artistic talents of [Valerio Schiti](https://www.instagram.com/valerio_schiti/?hl=en), [Lucas Werneck](https://www.instagram.com/lukaswerneck/?hl=en), [Stefano Caselli](https://www.instagram.com/stefano_caselli_art/), [Pepe Larraz](https://www.instagram.com/pepelarraz/?hl=en), [Mark Brooks](https://www.instagram.com/markbrooksart/?hl=en), [Tom Muller](https://www.instagram.com/hellomuller/), [Russel Dauterman](https://www.instagram.com/rdauterman/?hl=en), [Leinil Yu](https://www.instagram.com/leinilyu/?hl=en), [R.B. Silva](https://www.instagram.com/rbsilva_comics/?hl=en), and [Phil Noto](https://www.instagram.com/philnoto/?hl=en). (I really can't compliment the artists enough here.) Krakoa gave mutants the space to create a new identity, not just within Marvel's canon, but in the wider comic book world. Sci-fi aesthetics were brought back to the forefront by embracing the weirdest aspects of the X-Men; they no longer lived in a school in New York, but on a living island they could talk to. For the first time in a long time, the X-Men felt cool and cutting-edge again.\n\nWriting-wise, it addressed a lot of \"common criticisms\" of the X-Men by baking them directly into its concept. The X-Men now played into [Comic book deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_death) by making resurrections possible for anyone at any time. The convoluted timelines were transformed into a fight against fate and a cosmic struggle against AI machine life. The X-Men were no longer a minority in the world being hunted down or going extinct-- they were the next step in human evolution. The power mutants held weren't a burden or a responsibility anymore, but acknowledged as a strength. It very neatly cleaned up decades of complicated plot-lines, deaths, and relationships by just getting all the characters in one place.\n\nFor the characters, it was a mixed bag. Villains were evolved from one-note mustache-twirlers into complex characters with self-centered motives. Exodus, especially, went from a forgotten 90's villain into a fan-favorite character that proselytized a mutant religion. Heroes, like Kitty Pryde and Hope, were finally able to take the next step in their character arc after decades of false starts. But for most characters... they faded into the background. Even \"main characters\", like Laura Kinney and Betsy Braddock, often struggled to find momentum and penetrate the plot.\n\nFinally, the Krakoa Age emphasized the X-Men being sexual and queer. Surprisingly, this cut through the melodrama common to X-Men. Love triangles became polyamorous relationships instead of constant \"will-they-won't-they\"\u2019s. Characters that were hinted as being gay, such as Betsy Braddock and Rachael Summers, were open in Krakoa. Queerness wasn't just window dressing either. Mystique's lesbian relationship with Destiny was made a major on-going plot point. [The Hellfire Gala fashion event was popular to the point where Disney's D23 convention was hosting Hellfire Gala themed events.](https://d23.com/hellfiregala/) Usually Disney doesn't even acknowledge the Marvel comics, but Krakoa managed the impossible. [Though, perhaps unsurprisingly, Marvel is now trying to walk some of the more progressive ideas back.](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/cyclops-jean-grey-wolverine-were-never-an-x-men-throuple-official/)\n\nWhere Marvel struggled was with retaining the new audience. Marvel initially had a strong structure in place with their anthology system. One issue from six comics in one trade-- all unified by graphic, character, and world-building design elements. Marvel, however, couldn't help itself from publishing more and more comics until it overwhelmed its audience. You could read 12 on-going comics and 4 mini-series in a pandemic lockdown, however it was much harder to do that *and more* in post-pandemic life. The over-publication made reading impossible. It eventually made trade publication impossible. Who would want to read 8 comics, 3 crossover events, 11 mini-series, and 13 one-shots just to catch up? How do you even organize those comics into a coherent, chronological order? What's even worth reading? What were the good or bad comics? Marvel didn't know and didn't care.\n\nHickman leaving was an obvious breaking point as well. Few writers are able to tackle his dense themes. Even as early as HoXPoX, Hickman tried to make Krakoa a double-edged sword. The X-Office struggled to explore these themes and the overarching story stalled when Hickman left. It wasn't until Kieren Gillen and Al Ewing got in that it felt like the narrative was advancing again.\n\nThe X-Office had lots of ideas about Krakoa, but struggled to flesh them out. Much like a real writers' room, they were churning out episode ideas, but Marvel's solution was to turn them into mini-series instead of incorporating into the main comics. This led to the entire line bloated with comics, and causing both the main comics and mini-series to feel aimless. Neither could really truly make progress when characters were constantly being peeled off.\n\nSo the audience gave up.\n\nIt was too much too often with too little pay-off, and it led the X-Men franchise back to where it started: a franchise filled with underwhelming comics.\n\nKrakoa was messy, but it was also iconic.\n\n# Okay, But Should I Read This?\n\nYes, but no. Should you read every comic from the Krakoa Era? No. Unless you really, really, really need to. Should you read some of the comics? Yes. Absolutely. Here are a few options:\n\n**1) Top 5 Method:** [HoXPoX](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/1556/house-of-xpowers-of-x), [Hickman's *X-Men* comic](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/27567/xmen_2019_2021), [*Hellions*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/30175/hellions_2020_-_present), [*S.W.O.R.D.*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/31083/sword_2020_-_2021), [*Immortal X-Men*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/31375/immortal_x-men_2022_-_present), and [*X-Men: Red*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/32962/x-men_red_2022_-_present) are really good comics. These are the \"Top 5\" comics from the Krakoa Era [as voted on by the X-Men Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmen/comments/19619t5/best_krakoa_era_xbook_vote_results/). You can jump into any of these books without too much prep, but if you want a reading order just start in the order listed. The Top 5 list also deal with the themes and ideas of Krakoa the best, while giving a clean narrative through-line. It's not the full narrative, but it's the closest you get without reading handfuls of mini-series.\n\n**2) The Top 5 And Then Some Method:** If you want a handful of mini-series, just read the same order as above but slot in some minis here and there. I'd suggest reading [Planet-Size X-Men](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/91416/planet-size_x-men_2021_1) after you read X-Men #21, [*Inferno*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/32954/inferno_2021_2022) and [Trial of Magneto](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/32281/xmen_the_trial_of_magneto_2021) after Hickman's X-Men run, then read the [*Sins of Sinister*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2377/sins-of-sinister-the-complete-event) event after you read *Immortal X-Men* #10. Then you can finish off whatever you have left. Save [*X-Men: Forever*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/38947/xmen_forever_2024_present), *The Fall of the House of X and The Rise of the Powers of X*, and [X-Men #35](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/112189/x-men_2021_35) in that order for last. Realistically, you can read these after you read the Top 5. They just fill in details.\n\n**3) All Of Them Method:** And if you want that Sisyphean task, here's a list of lists: [Dawn of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/1664/dawn-of-x), [X of Swords](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/1994/x-of-swords), [Hellfire Gala](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2188/hellfire-gala) [Reign of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2059/reign-of-x), [Destiny of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2269/destiny-of-x), [A.X.E.](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2339/axe-judgment-day), [Sins of Sinister](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2377/sins-of-sinister-the-complete-event), [Dark Web](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2362/dark-web), [Before The Fall of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2396/before_the_fall_of_x), [Fall of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2409/fall-of-x). There's going to be a bunch of overlap and disconnected comics you're just going to have to deal with. Also, the Fall of X guide is not complete yet since Marvel doesn't upload their comics to their site until about 6 months after release.\n\n**4) The Main Story Method:** If you want \"just the plot important comics in order\" that's... um... difficult. The Krakoa Era becomes a viper's nest of interconnected comics that all vaguely interacting with each other at different points.\n\nMy best guess (oh god why did I do this): HoXPoX, Hickmen's *X-Men* #1-12, *Hellions* #1-4, *X of Swords* event, *Marauders* #20, *Hellfire Gala* event, *Trial of Magneto*, *Inferno*, *S.W.O.R.D.* #1-11, *X-Men* #16-21, *Hellions* #7-18, Duggan's *X-Men* #1-7, *Way of X* #1-5, *X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation* #1, *X Deaths of Wolverine/X Lives of Wolverine,* *Sabertooth* #1-5, *X-Men* #10-12, *Legion of X* #1-5, *Immortal X-Men #1-4*, *X-Men: Red* #1-4,  X-Men: *Hellfire Gala #1*, *A.X.E.* event ([alt list](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comics/event/14233/axe-judgment-day)... just read the core issues plus X-Men, X-Men: Red, Immortal X-Men, and Legion of X tie-ins), *Sabertooth and the Exiles* #1-5, *X-Men* #15-21, *Legion of X* #7-10, *X-Men: Red* #8-10, *Immortal X-Men* #8, *Sins of Sinister* event, *Immortal X-Men* #11-13, *X-Men: Red* #11-13, *X-Men* #22-24, *X-Men: Before The Fall - Sons of X* #1, *X-Men: Before The Fall - The Heralds of Apocalypse*, *X-Men: Before The Fall - The Sinister Four* #1, X-Men: *The Hellfire Gala* 2023 #1, *Immortal X-Men* #14-18, *X-Men: Red* #14-18, *Uncanny Spider-Man* #1-4, *X-Men Blue: Origins*, *Uncanny Spider-Man* #5, *X-Men* #25-34, *Resurrection of Magneto*, *X-Men: Forever*, *Fall of the House of X and Rise of the Powers of X*, *X-Men: The Wedding Specia*l #1, and *X-Men* #35.\n\n**Please just read the Top 5 list.**",

            "Oh, no, finally something I care about is showing up on r/HobbyDrama. \n\nI\u2019m so disappointed with how this all played out. When Hickman left, there was a brief moment of \u201coh, it\u2019s over\u201d before literally the best stewards possible in Kieron Gillen and Al Ewing - two of my other favorite writers - steering the line with Duggan sitting in the backseat pretending to help. I stand by everything up to Sins of Sinister being fantastic, and while different from what Hickman would have done, just as good in its own right. Then it all just fell apart in the usual Marvel Editorial Interference style.",
            "It\u2019s funny in a sad way how cape comics always get dangerously close to that secret sauce, the whole thing that can save cape comics, and they always walk away from it because they want all their heroes to return back to their states back when the editorial team was 12.",
            "Thanks for this writeup. As an extreme on again/off again comic reader, even I could feel how much of a step forward House of X/Powers of X was. The whole high-concept, super-dense style of writers like Hickman and Ewing is one of the things that consistently makes comics appealing to me, and I\u2019m glad to see them thrive.\n\nIs there any chance we could get a writeup on Hickman in general? He seems like a really interesting creator. Not perfect, but interesting.",
            "I was so wildly disappointed when they stopped doing the collected \u2018Dawn/Reign/Trials of X\u2019 trade paperbacks. I get that it stopped making sense because a lot of the lines didn\u2019t really have enough to connect them anymore but it made things so much easier to read! Plus the books just looked good on the shelf. I loved how uniform the spine designs were.",
            "I really wonder how much of Hickman's original plan was used, and how different things ended up being.\n\nOne thing that you didn't note, is that in spite of being a paradise, Krakoa was initially depicted as having very real cracks in its foundation. It's a separatist ethnostate that opened its doors to legitimate monsters, while also feeling very culty at times and posing a legitimate threat to the human world. I feel like Hickman would have explored all of that more, as a lot of that stuff faded away once he left.",
            "Thank you for putting this together, I tuned out when Hickman left figuring I'd pick it all back up later, only to see Emma Frost in Iron Man and wonder wtf was goin on.",
            "Thanks for the detailed post. Krakoa was one of those items that, as you said, was so prominent it bled into wider cultural news, but as I no longer have a LCS near me I couldn\u2019t really participate. This contextualizes a lot of the fan drama I\u2019ve heard over the years. Nice work!\n\nJust out of curiosity, which characters from Hickman\u2019s Secret Wars crossed over into Infinity War/Endgame?",
            "This was an excellent writeup. I read it all in one go and it was gripping. I am definitely checking the important bits out. Thank you.",
            "One thing I didn't see you mention is that there was an alleged 5 issue shortening of the Fall of X storyline by editorial that forced the creators to rush things in order to meet a much shorter deadline than they had originally planned planned to. If this shortening did happen(and I believe that it did), I'm actually really impressed with how well they managed to land the plane under the circumstances.",
            "Decent write up! Really enjoyed it. Personally I'd been mapping out a reading order all my own as I've been read the books since the start. I didn't think the \"Dawn of X\" trades and others were meant to be chronological to the events of the X books though. The first 4 issues of \"Fallen Angels\" only work if they all occur between the first and second issue if \"X-Force\"\n\nAlso, fire your editor; \"Trial\" not \"Trail\" in pretty much every use of the word in the write up."
