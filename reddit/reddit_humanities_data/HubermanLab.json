        "content": "I've been on this protocol for a few months because I've been traveling and missing many workouts. The basic premise is that you rest at least 96 hours between workouts, regardless which muscle group you work on.\n\nAnd you only do 1-2 sets per exercise to absolute failure, this doenst mean its easier, you will have to push yourself very hard. \n\nI was stuck forever on military press doing push pull legs but with this protocol I was able to gain 1-2 reps per week until I stacked more weight and so on.\n\nI saw a bunch of shorts by Mike Mentzer and then I listened to his Heavy duty book, which really opened my eyes on how much time I've been wasting in the gym doing more and more volume. \n\nIf high volume works for you and you see progress, thats great but this works for me.",

I work a 3/4 schedule at work and can only workout 2x per week before hitting fatigue, usually 48-72 hours apart, in that case could i workout once a week? That doesn't seem optimal for me. I would love to try it on a 2 day plan, but if i have to wait 96 hours, that would be tough.",
            "You\u2019re following the true Mentzer Program? Not the one Dorian Yates did? \n\nThat\u2019s really interesting and I am sure a lot of bodybuilders would like to hear about it. I\u2019ve done his modified program for years and it got me to a HW bodybuilder physique. Lots of food and other stuff was involved. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re following the program those are awesome gains.",
