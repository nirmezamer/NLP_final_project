Again, I cannot lift weights nor do any activity that will get you out of breath.\n\nIs there a way for people in this kind of situation to build muscle? I dont think lifting very small weights for many reps and for a long time would work. Toning the muscles it would, but I would say that for that I am better off gardening or doing other similar activities (to the extent I can).\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

            "I don\u2019t like breathlessness when I\u2019m weight training so I do fewer & slower reps with very controlled breathing. It can almost feel like meditation when you are focused on nice long in breaths through the nose and out the mouth while lifting at same time. And there\u2019s a good hack for this. Don\u2019t play pumped up music in your earphones. Play zen music (like the stuff you hear in a spa or massage place. Make yourself a play list). Let that be your soundscape. And you will become the most chilled weight lifter. \n\nGood luck!",

            "It's confirmed that you can still grow muscles by performing up to 30 rep sets. Is that still under the amount of reps you can do with the weights you can handle?\n\nThe key to building muscles is doing between 10 and 20 hard sets weekly per muscle group, getting the sets very close to failure (having 2 reps in reserve is close enough) and eating a surplus of calories. It's hard to miss it and not worth it to overthink it. Just do it\n\nNike",
