        "content": "Just graduated from HSW with a MM PE offer, and honestly from what I have seen there are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to bschool, here are some of them:\n\n* B-school is a time to \"find yourself\" - this couldn't be farther from the truth, the way the FT MBA program is set up you need a clear plan prior to starting\n* M7 or bust mentality - the most important thing I found in recruiting was your pre-MBA work experience, not school brand. Even if you go to Harvard, you won't get hired at Citadel if you don't know shit about investing and don't have relevant pre-mba experience.\n* School rankings don't mean shit- I see all these post comparing Johnson vs. Tepper and CBS vs. NYU Stern. Quite frankly, the way I look at the rankings is: Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, Booth, CBS are in their own league (these schools probably give you a leg up on getting interviews at the most prestigious firms), otherwise any T20 can get you into banking, consulting etc. Sure you might need to hustle a little but more at say Georgetown then NYU Stern, but if you can't hustle to get the job, you likely aren't a good fit for banking or consulting anyway.\n\nFeel free to disagree, but I just wanted to post this because I noticed many students were disappointed in my year because they thought going to HSW would change their life, when the truth is pre-mba experience is way more relevant than school brand and they got duped into paying 250k and ended up getting the same job as they would have gotten if they went to any T20",

            ">the most important thing I found in recruiting was your pre-MBA work experience, not school brand.\n\nThis deserves to be in the title!",
            "Hard agree on point 2. Many of my classmates thought that they could just walk in and take any business-adjacent job because of a branded MBA. They kept highlighting the M7 MBA as a selling point. \n\nNah bro, they want direct experience. Some of my friends are struggling in the job market because they keep thinking the MBA alone would get them the job.",
            "This is so true ! \n\nEspecially the part about pre MBA work experience. Yes, you can pivot with a top MBA but many times if you have years of experience in tech or corporate finance then you have a huge advantage and many firms will be interested in you with relevant work experience. \n\nSome people hear the unicorn stories of people who majored in musical theater but get a Top tier MBA  and then land a role at a FAANG company as a product manager. While this does happen, it is very rare. \n\nThis is not the norm!\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed a lot of wildly successful people in Bay Area tech industry who didn\u2019t go to the most elite colleges / grad schools but have great work experience and a burning desire to succeed. \n\nHard work and grit can take you very far if you are determined to be successful.",
            "> M7 or bust mentality is false \n\n> Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, Booth, CBS are in their own league\n\n\nWhat?",
            "Agreed with #1 and #2, but slightly different reasons (which impact thought on #3):\n\n1. You need to go into B-school with an idea of what you want to do - industry transition, 2-year break (before returning to prior job), firm up-tiering in same industry, etc.; There are too much distractions starting Day 1 that people who are not focused easily get lost and then forget that they need to recruit for a job\n\n2. The more important point is for any job where supply >>> demand (PE, hedge funds, etc.), there will be more criteria - so obviously, if you are trying to get into PE or HF, school ranking matters but then so does prior experience because at HSW / M7, the number of students who want those jobs >> opportunities; so prior experience / references / knowing people matter. That being said, using OP's example, if you're trying to work at Citadel but coming from T20, it's going to be SIGNIFICANTLY harder than from HSW...\n\n3. See #2. Sure school rankings matter less, but for any desirable job where supply > demand, you want to have as much of a leg up vs. your peers. You can get a job in IB or MBB from T20, but is it meaningfully harder than HSW / M7? Yes. I don't think rankings mean everything, but everyone should target as high of a ranked school that they can get into",
            "First bulletpoint should be in bold caps lock! Can't stress that enough after failing to find myself in the first 6 days before recruiting started.",
            "To your second point, it does seem like the MBA is increasingly less of a chance at a career restart or a golden ticket into consulting/finance. With a tougher job market, increased specialization/emphasis on technical skills, and AI/automation creating efficiencies that necessitate fewer workers, it certainly seems like pre-MBA experience is more important than ever in landing a job. Gone are the days when you could go to a top MBA program and stumble into a lucrative career in IB or a top consulting firm. I really hope more MBA applicants realize this so that they don\u2019t have unrealistic expectations about their post-MBA job prospects.",
            "Here's an unpopular position: Consulting isn't a real job, and the cost to pay them greatly outweighs the benefits you get.",
            "The other part that's wildly misunderstood here is that there's a ton of selection bias in the data. People act as if the students at all top-20 school are the same and the differences in outcomes are largely explained by the quality of the schools/brand. The reality is that folks starting at HSW (or whatever schools are at the top these days) are likely some combination of higher IQ, harder working, better looking, more charismatic, better job experience, taller, etc. Of course top jobs are going to take more people from those pools. If you pulled someone from HBS that got a job at Goldman and re-ran their business school experience at Fuqua, I'd bet an enormous percentage of the time they get that same job.\n\nQualifications: 15 years out of T10 MBA program MBB>PE>Entrepreneur.

I've seen some similar posts asking for fashion advice, but most don't seem to be starting from scratch like I am. I've been in the military since I graduated college 4 years ago. My role the last two years was incredibly time consuming (working around 80 hour weeks across 6 days) and most days when I got home I made dinner and started getting ready for bed without changing out of my uniform. The few days a month that I had off, I'd usually just chill in gym clothes. \n\nNow that I'm getting out of the military and starting my MBA in the fall, I'm realizing I have essentially no civilian clothes because the last time I bought clothes remotely regularly was when I was in college, and I obviously need to upgrade my wardrobe from what it was when I was a broke college kid. Not to mention most of those clothes don't fit anymore.\n\nI've already bought a tailored navy suit. I plan on buying a charcoal suit as well, but I'd appreciate any advice or tips for building the rest of my wardrobe. I'm particularly interested in what brands you like, how many of each item you'd recommend having (ie how many suits, how many shirts, how many chinos etc) and even brands for nice but casual clothes you'd wear to go out with friends.\n\nI'm not trying to be the coolest person in my program or anything like that, but I would like to look presentable and not show up in 5 inch nike shorts and a t-shirt.

Lots of sweaters and jackets available for good prices if you're in a cooler climate.

I actually found it an easy way to connect with someone if they were wearing a cool tshirt or cap with a band name, sports team, social cause etc. \n\nConventional wisdom said wear clothes in which you\u2019d be ok if you were seen by a recruiter, but on campus visits largely became virtual post-COVID.
