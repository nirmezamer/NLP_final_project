Please follow these simple rules:\n\n1. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb **Anything goes.** Talk about any topic you want, but avoid asking anything about the language -- leave that for a separate post. Try your comment has at least 20-25 words, the longer the better. Very short comments will be removed.\n3. \u2705 **Corrections are allowed.** Just don't go overboard with long explanations.\n1. \u261d\ud83c\udffb **ONLY SPANISH**. No English or any other languages are allowed. Exception: really, REALLY short examples if you are correcting someone, but the overall correction and interaction should be in full Spanish.\n4. \ud83e\udd16 **No ChatGPT, automatic translators, or other AI-assisted tools.** Everything you write should be original. Text produced by translators or AI tools is very easy to spot, so be aware your comment will be removed.\n\nAs usual, also follow Reddit's general rules.\n\nHablantes nativos y avanzados: cuiden su forma de escribir. Pueden usar regionalismos y jerga tanto como deseen, pero vigilen su ortograf\u00eda, acentos (as\u00ed es, TODOS los acentos), signos '\u00a1' y '\u00bf', y gram\u00e1tica en general. Hagan que sus comentarios sean un ejemplo para quienes est\u00e1n aprendiendo.\n\nHave fun!",

Literally everyone does it and when you're learning a language the people you're talking to are usually going to understand that you're gonna take more time to think about what you wanna say.
