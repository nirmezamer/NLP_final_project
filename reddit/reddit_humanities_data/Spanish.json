            "So although they both would express a similar meaning, \"No entend\" would translate to \"I didn't understand this thing that just happened\" while \"no entiendo\" would be used in a situation that is ongoing. So \"no entend\" would work with a joke that you didn't get and \"no entiendo\" would work for when you don't understand why people consider the comedian funny",

            "Literally they be SCREAMING that \"eehhhhhhh\" too  Like I swear Spanish speakers take more pauses when speaking than English speakers do. My advice to OP, since I also pause and think a lot, is to not worry about it. Literally everyone does it and when you're learning a language the people you're talking to are usually going to understand that you're gonna take more time to think about what you wanna say. That pause time gets less and less the more you learn and the more you practice. Especially with the phrases you use daily.",

Honestly none of that does justice to explain who she is or why she's (in?)famous here in Spain. Her nickname is \"la princesa del pueblo\" and I guess she would be like...similar to a Kardashian, but if the Kardashians knew they weren't classy and leaned into it instead of pretending to be/taking themselves so seriously? You'll find tons of content if you look up her name + memes, like recently there was a picture of her with the Queen Letizia of Spain, who was wearing a purple suit, and there was a meme going around of the picture with the caption \"The Queen of Spain posing with a fan who is wearing an adorable purple suit!\"  \n  \nAnyway, the phrase comes from when she would say it on Slvame (a celebrity gossip TV program), literally saying goodbye to a coworker of hers whose name is Maricarmen but it became a whole meme in Spain and now people use it as a funny way to say goodbye and/or as the English equivalent of \"Bye, Felicia\"   \n[Here's a video if it](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eHAVzgy-l4g)\n\nWhile looking this up to confirm for you I came across [an analysis](https://www.upf.edu/web/merce_oliva/celebrity-class-gender-spain) of her public image/cultural significance. It seems super interesting so far and I haven't finished reading yet but if you want I can summarize after I do."
