            "Is there a real life equivalent to looksmaxxing guides? Like some professional advice? After getting my last thread removed by the automod tool it occurred to me I have a lot of money to get my problems addressed by professionals who would have an actual incentive to give me good advice and proper attention. But I'm not sure what that profession would be. Plastic surgeons? Salon stylists? What's the best place to get real life looksmaxxing advice for a fee?",

            "this subreddit is weird. people come here to ask literally how to maximize their look. commenters will say \"no need to change anything\". \n\nor people will say the obvious thing as lose weight. Guys, the OP obviously wanted to ask how to maximize their look with their current weight or face.",

            "Can there be a rule that if somebody says \u201cexcept this\u201d that people don\u2019t bombard them with comments saying it, I see this a lot about weight",
