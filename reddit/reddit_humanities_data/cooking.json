            "I'm marinading whole chicken leg pieces to have with rice later. My question is, is it safe to cook the rice with the left over marinade in a rice cooker?\n\nI'm basically wondering if a rice cooker gets hot enough to kill all the bacteria in the marinade from the raw chicken.\n\nThanks in advance.",
            "What is the best way to store and open package of bacon?",
            "I didn\u2019t know I needed to soak my asparagus, I just rinsed it like a regular vegetable and roasted it in olive oil. It\u2019s gritty so I think it still had dirt on it, can I wash it a second time and then throw it in the air fryer to heat it back up? I don\u2019t want to waste it.",
            "I bought a lb. of skin-on salmon that consisted of two fillets.  I removed these from the plastic tray they came in and placed them in a glass container in the freezer.  Now they are stuck to the glass container.  I want to thaw and eat only one fillet and leave the other in the freezer.  Does anyone know how I can achieve this, considering that they're stuck to the glass container?  I figure I will have to thaw the container with both fillets inside at once.",
            "I just finished thinning my 3 yr old apple trees.  Is it safe to use the baby apples to make pectin? I am wondering if there is too high a concentration of cyanide in under developed apples.",
            "I just ordered some mussels (St. Jacob scallops) ate like 2 and started to feel that they actually taste strange- like they left a bitter/spicy taste, as if I you'd eat a nutmeg or ginger (edit- i found a better comparison- as if you chew some rosemary leaves) that numb, lingering feel on the tongue. Waiter told me its cause they added some pepper, but damn I know the difference between hot as in spicy and tongue numbness you can get from some things. I know its mostly glassballing here, but how are the chances that these scallops were bad?",
            "I always put it in tupperware. Bacon has a tendency as any meat to oxidize quickly and become grey",
            "I've never had to soak asparagus - are you sure it wasn't just some seasoning making it gritty?\n\nFrom a food safety standpoint you're fine to rinse it and cook again, but it'll probably be overcooked",
            "Could it have been Szechuan pepper on them? That makes your mouth weirdly numb.",
            "I put it in a gallon ziplock bag so I can squeeze out all the extra air",
            "After I posted this I went and tried another piece and it was fine, I wonder if the first piece I tasted was slightly over looked when I rinsed them. I also may have over seasoned it and that was making it gritty, who knows."

I made a big pot, put the leftover a big gallon bowl. My daughters boyfriend came over the next day.  They were missing. He ate the entire bowl.

My personal favorite is smoked salmon and it's now the only way I can eat salmon. Everything he makes is restaurant quality outstanding. I have an apartment and can't even have a grill so it makes it extra enticing to go home for good barbecue!! He never cooked while I was growing up so this is a relatively recent hobby and my goodness we are so glad he ventured out.",

Tried like crazy to recreate it, so far no dice. It smells, tastes, and feels like home.",

She called them Hoosier cookies. I think they go by many names depending on the region you're in. She brought them every Thanksgiving and the only person in the family she taught to make them is me.\n\nAlso my grandma's pumpkin pie. It's the original Libby's recipe on the side of the can. The one made with sugar and evaporated milk, NOT the one with condensed milk. The texture of the custard is so much softer and creamy as hell. My mom makes the condensed milk version and it just doesn't compare. \n\nI'm sure you can tell that I have much stronger memories of my grandmother's cooking. My mom is a good cook, but Grandma is the best.",

It\u2019s fast, easy, cheap, and delicious, and I have such intense nostalgia for it. I can still see the big bowl she served it in.\n\nIngredients:\nOne box pasta (we always did penne)\nOlive oil \nOne onion, chopped or diced \n4oz tomato paste (can or tube; can eyeball it)\nOne can diced tomatoes (whatever size you have)\nOne log goat cheese (6-8 oz to taste)\nPlenty of fresh basil, chopped\nSalt & pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\nBring water to a boil and salt generously.\n\nSaut\u00e9 onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt until translucent.

You can top it with unsweetened applesauce or sauerkraut. My absolute comfort is broccoli and carrots with chicken sausage mixed in, topped with both sauerkraut and applesauce.  \nPannekoek is like a thick crepe. Growing up, it was bananas and whipped cream inside--which is still a favorite.  \nI know how to make stamppot, but I occasionally bother my mom to make pannekoek when I visit!",

Now I make my own meatloaf from scratch and usually improvise the seasonings so it's different every time. As an adult I tried the old onion soup method and it was just ok. Mom was never a very good cook. Lots of Mac and cheese, hamburger helper and shake n bake.",
            "Mom used to make French dip sandwiches the day after she'd make roast beef. No grocery store delis in those days where we lived.\n\nWhat I loved best was she would just make a whole bunch of sandwiches, not just one each, and serve them on her large cutting board. Eat as many as you could. \n\nThat was so good.\n\nDamn, I miss my mom.",

She finally settled on one that was tomato based but I actually ended up making up my own which was a beef gravy based one.\n\nI also like to make Chicken and Dumplings and Chili Pie with a corn bread topping. I like meat based casseroles, stews, soups, pot pies, stuff like that. I'm also big on hand held meat pastry pies and have about a dozen different ones I like to make from different countries. \n\nWhen my Dad was still alive before he got sick and lost all interest in food I used to make different casseroles and meat pies because I knew he'd at least try those and it was real food unlike the Stouffer's meals he'd practically live on if you let him. \n\nMy Mom rarely cooked except on holidays. Most of the time I ended up cooking for myself and later I'd end up just making big pots of pasta sauce, stews, chili or soups so they would eat real food too. Otherwise they'd just exist on eggs and sausages or bacon for breakfast and whatever bar food was available any given night at whatever place they ended up doing Happy Hour at. \n\nI was cooking whole meals by the time I was 10. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks. My Mom taught me a little. She wasn't a bad cook most of the time but I'd say at least 3/4 of her recipes involved boxes or cans and rarely more than a few steps. She never really cooked much from scratch. \n\nI am admittedly lazy when it comes to making baked goods from scratch. I will often start with a mix and add stuff rather than start from scratch and sift flour and all that. But mostly when it comes to eating regular food I like to cook mostly from scratch from fresh ingredients. \n\nThe only major cheat when I am cooking stuff like soup is that is I do like Better Than Bouillon and will always add some even when I make stock from a chicken. I don't mind chicken stock but I like it a bit richer and thicker, and I get that with the BTB stuff. \n\nMy soups are always hearty with thicker broth like stews or chowders. With rare exceptions I don't like thin broth soups much. \n\nThese days I have to watch carbs because I'm diabetic so I have to work around the potato/crust thing. I can't make things like Cottage Pie or Pot Pies as much as I used to. I tend to make chili and soup more. Every once in a while though I've still got to have some kind of meat pie.\n\nI'm definitely a meat and potatoes/pasta person.

Look up Andrew Zimmern's recipe; he has recipes for it in a number of places, all of which are different from each other. (The only problem is it requires boiling noodles which puts a lot of steam into your kitchen.)\n\n*Wurstsalat* is a cold and filling meal and it keeps well if you want to make a huge batch of it and eat it for multiple meals. I've made it a number of times with varying levels of authenticity in the ingredients and no matter how you make it, it's all good. Just make sure your wurst is precooked as this is a no-cook recipe. I recommend using a better pickle with this rather than a low end one. (Note: you don't have to cut things into sticks if it doesn't make sense. As long as most ingredients are about the same size, it's okay if you slice the sausage into rounds/use precut pickle chips/etc.) [https://www.daringgourmet.com/swiss-wurstsalat-sausage-salad/](https://www.daringgourmet.com/swiss-wurstsalat-sausage-salad/) Feel free to double the dressing if you like. We like to pair a crusty bread with it for some carbs and to dip up the juices afterward.\n\nFor slow cooker, I do a pork shoulder with Puerto Rican & Cuban flavors. I double the mojo from [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/cuban-roast-pork-shoulder-mojo-recipe) (but only put half on it), cook the pork via [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/puerto-rican-pernil-slow-cooker-recipe), then go back to the first recipe to pull the pork & make the sauce with the leftover mojo. It's even better if you add fresh cilantro for the sauce, but still totally delicious without it. Makes a ton and the leftovers are spectacular: freeze 'em for later or have fantastic tacos on day 2 or 3.\n\nAnd there's always the idea of a some kind of *grazing tray* for dinner. Some combination of charcuterie, cheese board, crudit\u00e9s, relish tray, with some kind of flatbread (or crackers) and dips or spreads. You can go Italian antipasto, you can go Middle Eastern/Mediterranean mezze, you can go German with Abendbrot or Brotzeit, you can go Korean with a bunch of banchan or Spanish tapas inspired, or mix it up with whatever you have in the fridge. I try to keep meats, cheeses, crackers, pickles, dips, and fruits (dried or fresh) and nuts around specifically for this kind of easy but flavorful meal.\n\nYou can do as much or as little actual cooking as you like. Like for the mezze I might make falafel (or heat up some premade kibbe from Trader Joe's) but everything else is premade; if I'm really feeling like cooking, I may make my own [hummus](https://www.foodiewithfamily.com/homemade-hummus/) (so easy, so cheap, makes a ton, you can vary it a million ways) or baba ganoush (which is basically hummus, sub the chick peas for roasted eggplant) as well. But if all you want to do is buy stuff and arrange it, that's totes valid as well & I do it too.\n\nBut my old standby for eating while being hot, it's hard to go wrong with *pimento cheese spread sandwiches* and cubes of cold *cantaloupe* from the fridge. Maybe even have some *gazpacho* if you're feeling fancy, or switch out the sandwiches for some *Saint Andre cheese* (goes AMAZING with sweet ripe cantaloupe.)\n\nAnd, for my money, nothing beats a good cold *tuna salad sandwich*. ;)",

And then someone else replied to me basically saying that plenty of people live in this kind of heat with no AC. I'm like um, where lol",
            "I do agree that its hard to want to eat when walking into a hot, wet blanket.  Last summer, I went to visit one of my BFFs in Florida (Tampa Bay) and OMFG.  We were out walking his dog in August and saw an alligator by the pond.  I didn't even care if it ate me.  It was so fucking hot.  The alligator didn't even move because I think it was thinking the same thing.  Just make me into boots already."

Know that you should pull the buttercream out of the fridge (if you're keeping it there; smbc does not actually need to be refrigerated), allow it to get to room temperature, and re-aerate it up for five minutes or so before use by beating the shit out of it with a stand mixer on medium. Makes it fluffy again.\n\n* Cake layers\n\nTry an amsterdam cake or an italian cream cake if you're at a loss for what to do, they're fiddly and you'll feel accomplished afterward. If you're new to cake-making, 'one bowl' recipes like carrot cake, hummingbird cake, and red velvet are very beginner friendly.\n\nI personally always chill my cake layers in the fridge overnight. Wait until they cool completely and then wrap loosely in plastic wrap. The chilling develops the flavor; some pastries are better fresh but cake (sans quickbreads like banana bread) is not one of them imo.\n\n* Fillings\n\nCitrus, tropical fruit, or berry curd (I don't recommend citrus with chocolate cake), caramel (easiest with a candy thermometer, also please be careful because it's basically sugar napalm), ganache, bavarian cream, coconut cream, compote or homemade jam, homemade marshmallow. Fillings can be as time-consuming as you want them to be. Liqueurs and liquors are also an option, if you like to make homemade liqueur.\n\nMost fillings are fine to be chilled once cooled.\n\n* Toppings\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, toppings like chocolate cookies (think oreos), ganache again, thinned a bit more to drip, piped chocolate decorations ([like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/c1/b1/46c1b1d085536cf47969cd943dbdb0b6.jpg), can also be done with white chocolate or colored shortening called melts), buttercream flowers (extremely fun to make, buy a flower nail if you want to be fancy), chocolate-dipped strawberries, sugared grapes or citrus peel, candied fruit (a whole project by itself), glazed fruit, praline/brittle, truffles, brigadeiro, gold dust... you can literally put anything on a cake, and a lot of it is time-consuming and detailed.\n\n* Assemblage and decorating\n\nThere are so many ways to assemble a cake it's hard to know where to begin. A basic frosting with piped florets or flowers on top is a great start. But honestly, the sky's the limit. Just google 'cake decoration' and look at the image results.\n\n---\n\nCakes can take as little or as much time as you want. You can slap together a cake with a box mix and some cream cheese icing, which is great, or you can spend multiple days making components and learning decoration techniques.",

The other half can either be shaped into pizza dough or focaccia, or rolled and stored for an overnight cold ferment to make English muffins the next morning. Once you've made them using sourdough and overnight cold fermentation, it will spoil you for any other English muffins including ones made from scratch with active dry yeast.

You use toasted spices, and numerous ingredients in a wok with the lamb to create a sauce and then stir fry in the fresh noodles and greens. There's no overnight marination, but there's a lot of prep like most Chinese and Indonesian dishes.\n\nUsing a Weber kettle, charcoal briquets and soaked hickory chips to smoke a brisket or make pulled pork.

There are lots or recipes with varying amounts of different ingredients, different bones and beef cuts used, more or less spices and aromatics, etc, but here\u2019s how I usually make it:\n\n1. Get a large stockpot, at least 4 gallons. A cheap steel one from Walmart is fine\n\n2. For the broth: \n   a. 2 lbs of beef ribs, 2 lbs oxtail, 1 lb beef marrow bones\n   b. A 2-4 lbs brisket\n\n3. The aromatics and spices (must be whole, not ground or minced):\n   a. 1 very large onion or 2 regular large onions\n   b. 1-2 finger size pieces of ginger\n   c. **optional** 1 shallot bulb and as many cloves of garlic as you like\n   d. 1/2 cup fish sauce\n   e. 1 tbsp good coarse salt\n   f. 1 tbsp rock or turbinado sugar\n   g. 3 cinnamon sticks\n   h. 10 star anise pods\n   i. 3 cardamom pods\n   j. 2 tbsp coriander seeds\n   k. 1 tbsp black peppercorns\n   l. 10 whole cloves\n   m. 1 teaspoon fennel seeds\n\n4. For serving \n   a. 1 lb raw flank steak or round roast, very thinly sliced against the grain\n   b. flat rice noodles\n   c. Garnishes: cilantro, Thai basil, mint, bean sprouts, sliced green onions/scallions, thinly sliced chili peppers, lime wedges\n   d. Optional sauces: sriracha, hoisin, plum, chili oil, more fish sauce\n\n5. The process:\n\n  a. Preheat oven to 350 and roast the bones for 30 minutes flipping over halfway through\n\n  b. Put brisket in the stock pot, cover with water, bring to boil, and simmer for 10 minutes. \n\n  c. Add roasted bones to the pot, simmer 45 minutes to an hour, skimming scum. Then drain water, rinse brisket, wash the bones, clean the pot, and add meat and bones back to the pot, cover with about water, as much as you can fit in the pot without the water level being too high. When washing the bones, use your hands to scrub gunk off. \n\n   d. Cut onions in half, and char onions, ginger, and optional shallot and garlic under your broiler or directly on the rack of a gas stovetop over the burners\n\n   e. Toast the whole spices and cinnamon sticks in a dry pan until they start to get fragrant, 30 seconds MAX and put in a tea strainer or spice bag (it\u2019s important to use one, as well as whole spices, because you want the broth to be clear as possible, and ground spices make it cloudy, as well as unskimmed scum). \n\n  f. Add all charred aromatics and spice strainer/bag to the pot and bring to a simmer. ** All simmering is done uncovered, and periodically add more fresh water to keep the pot full as the water evaporates and the level lowers**. Remove the brisket after 2-3 hours and thinly slice. Simmer for the next 6-12 hours, periodically skimming the scum that floats to the top. The broth should finish and be clear (yes, it\u2019ll have some color from the meat, bones, and other ingredients, but it should not be cloudy at all). \n\n  g. To serve, put sliced brisket, a few of the ribs/oxtail sections, rice noodles, and raw flank steak or round roast in a bowl. The raw beef should be sliced so thinly that it instantly cooks when you pour the hot broth over it. Garnish with the fresh herbs, chilies (if you want spicy), and any of the sauces you like, and enjoy. \n\n  h. When the remaining broth has cooled, put it into freezer bags, label appropriately, and freeze. I like to use smaller bags that would fit a single portion of broth whenever I want a bowl of pho, so I don\u2019t have to thaw a whole gallon bag and waste it. \n\nI hope I didn\u2019t forget anything.",

            "The initial boil gets rid of all the scum which traditionalists say effects the taste (therefore i dont even have to skim at all, i just discard the water then rinse the bones).

            "It\u2019s going to have a weird foamy texture and therefore won\u2019t be pho. Definitely throw it out. You only boil it for 45 minutes to an hour at first anyway, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be a well-developed broth after that time.",

            "IDK, what?",
            "It certainly seems like it would, but it doesn\u2019t. Roasting them basically caramelizes the bones deeper down and accelerates the undesirable gunk cooking out so it doesn\u2019t take as long for all that scum to float to the top. It\u2019s not a necessary step, but it does yield a richer and deeper flavor as well as less skimming during the long simmer, and it can cut hours off of the total simmering time.",
            "I don\u2019t know if you saw it before I edited it, but I forgot to mention to do all simmering uncovered, and keep adding more fresh water to the pot to keep it full as the water evaporates during the simmering. \n\nOf course! I hope you enjoy! Most of the work is front-loaded into the first couple hours and you\u2019re doing a lot then, but once you get to the part after washing the bones after the initial 45 minute simmer, it\u2019s very little work, just skimming every hour or two. Oh, and also add the salt, fish sauce, and sugar in the step after washing the bones, and if you want to use MSG, put maybe 1/2-3/4 teaspoon in there too.",

I started eating spicy food so I would not have to share with my 5 siblings. grew up still very picky until my late 20's and started going to different restaurants with friends to try stuff we never had before. started with very mild salsas and worked my way up to habanero, before backing down to cayenne.\n\nI make, Mexican, Italian, German, and even made some curries.

My sister and I were probably eight and nine years old and my mom asked if we wanted to ride with her to go up to Cumberland rutabaga days. My sister and I were all excited all the way up there we\u2019re talking about which rides were gonna go on, what we\u2019re gonna eat at the carnival things like that. It was like an hour and a half drive up there we get there. My sister and I are all excited, my mom pulls off to the first vegetable stand buys a gunny sack of rutabaga, throws it in the trunk of the car and turns around and heads home.",

But went vegetarian at 13 (this was 1997 in Missouri - what an experience) and ate mostly fries and cheese pizza until I moved out to California in 2004 and my whole world opened up.

But my neighbors always had different foods, like my friend\u2019s grandma from Okinawa made me Japanese food when I stayed the night, and our Mexican neighbors invited us over for a carne asada a few times. Our Russian friend introduced me to cucumber salad and pelmeni dumplings. We went to a Greek festival at a church my dad worked with each year and I tried a bunch of Greek foods for the first time.\n\nAlso, once in a while my dad would cook a fancy dinner, or we would go out, and my parents always encouraged us to try new things. \n\nWhen I hit high school my dad got a huge bonus at work and he got a promotion and started making more money and we went on a cruise and I tried so many foods on that trip because my parents were like try anything once you don\u2019t know until you try it!",

            "My parents grew up in households where anything spicier than regular salt and on occassion pepper was considered sinful.\n\n\n\u00a0I once ruined Christmas by adding a clove of garlic to my Nan's abomination of a gravy. My Nan's terrors regarding food poisoning and ptomaine disease (never did figure out what this was but it involved lobster Thermidor in 1928) meant that all meats and veggies were under spiced so you could taste the disease but overcooked to kill the disease. Cooked veggies that weren't liquid was a revelation as was turkey meat that didn't crumble like sawdust. Mum was a better cook but had been overly influenced by her Mum's fears but we did have spices.\n\n\n\n\nMy father grew up in poverty with a mother who did horribly things to food, and rejected refrigeration as an abomination. My father survived as he has a stomach of steel and no taste buds. His tastes don't really count as he once mistook my sourdough starter for yoghurt.\n\n\nAnd while I will never be into really spicy food, I do cook and eat very diverse foods from many cultures around the world.\u00a0",

My single Mom also had a BF that introduced me to Greek and Pakistani food very early on. Not to mention we had Filipino and African neighbors who always welcomed me to a plate of whatever they were cooking. I guess you can say I was pretty lucky and had a really diverse range of cuisine exposed to me at a very young age.",

I experiment all the time and I love buying spices.  I am a good intuitive cook and have good sense on what things work together.  I do make some of my childhood foods but make things well beyond what I ate growing up.  But for me the differences are seasonings and preparations.  And nothing too esoteric beyond the spices. \n\nMy mom\u2019s love of vinegar and acids translates into what flavors I like and what I tend to be drawn too.",
            "My mother was a pretty diverse cook compared to my friends' parents when I was growing up, but since then I've learnt a bunch of dishes like Japanese, Ethiopian and Thai, that I don't recall having as a kid.",
            "Grew up on meat, potatoes, and pasta, in large part due to my mom having a lot of food allergies that we had to menu around.  I also grew up as a bit of a picky eater, and while I've grown out of that for the most part, the menu never really adjusted to that. \n\nNow, I still eat pretty similar with more frozen food involved (not much time to cook as a student), but now it's mostly because I live on my own in college and it's hard to cook \"real\" recipes while only cooking for myself and wanting some variety. Things either go bad because I try to have variety in my meals or every meal is very similar because I'm trying to use up the bag of potatoes I bought. Despite that, Chef Jean-Pierre on Youtube has made life a lot easier in this regard because so many of his recipe videos involve many of the same ingredients while being very different from one another.",
            "I grow up on vegetarian and vegan and raw vegan food. I had many Mexican, Italian food, but once in a while I would go to a Chinese place, but as a kid I did not like Chinese food.\n\n\nI am still a vegetarian and I try to cook a lot of vegan food through out the week since my boyfriend had a lot of food sensitivity to a lot of food.\n\nI do cook Indain food and make Currys from scratch,  I will also cook Thai, Chinese, Mexican, Italian. And any other kind of food that seems to be yummy.\n\nI also enjoy baking my own bread and pizza doughs from scratch aswell.",
            "I grew up in that slice of America that migrated to the Midwest and took with it a lack of interest in seasoning. So my food was pretty bland growing up \u2014 not anyone\u2019s fault, just what my parents knew. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll give a good go at most Asian food, most European food, and I\u2019d like to try some different MENA dishes. I even made dal at home and would gladly do so again.",
            "I grew up in the 60s with canned spinach and canned asparagus and canned soup. That said, my mother made stuffed cabbages, lentil soup, tuna casserole, curried crab over rice, shrimp, standing rib roast, stew, lasagna with a lovely mornay, fantastic stuffing for the turkey, baked chicken, ribs, stuffed flank steak with wine sauce, pea soup, great desserts...\n\nMy sons and I all are adventurous cooks. One tends toward Korean, the other more Thai curries. I'll make whatever I get the inspiration to cook.",

I consider myself blessed bcz the \"picky\" eaters I know all seem trapped by their palates, and seem to expect others to eat the same way - ie, complaining about how they \"cant\" eat a hundred different things as if the taste of something new, that they end up NOT liking, will kill them.",

An oven that is still heating will be more likely to have hot and cold spots, so the glass will heat up unevenly, causing some parts of the glass to expand faster than others, which then results in cracking.",
            "The problem here is that pre-heating is essentially the \"broil\" function. It's blasting the elements to try to get the oven air up to temp quickly.\n\nDuring normal cooking, the hot air is supposed to cook the food, not the elements. So when you put stuff in during pre-heat, instead of 350 degree air gently warming your entire pan from all sides, you get the broiler blasting heat at it from one direction.\n\nThis causes a heat gradient in the cookware; the top is now WAY hotter than the bottom. When things get hot, they expand. When things expand unevenly, they can warp, or in the case of glass, they can break.",

It also is slightly \u201cspicy\u201d or more bitter to taste and has the most spectacular fresh smell, just as you describe. \n\nIt keeps these characteristics for about a two months.

            "> How do I know which is which when buying.\n\nSize of the bottle, labeling, and source. Price per volume and size of the bottle are booth good indicators generally, although some exceptions exist. \n\nThe big thing about olive oils is that there is a huge variety. They're different batch to batch, year to year, field to field, the growing conditions for the olives make a difference. The time that they're picked make a difference, early harvest tends to be extremely strong but breaks down quickly, late season tends to be weaker flavor but longer lasting. Blended oils take the average, both the good and the bad.\n\nWhen you see the large bottles, 500 ml, 1 liter, or larger, they're typically blended and bulk for general cooking.  They're usually not labeled with descriptive words other than *\"extra virgin olive oil\".*  As many people mentioned, Costco is surprisingly good and generally has quite delicious olive oil in big bottles. \n\nIf you're buying 100 ml or 250 ml bottles you're probably looking at a finishing oil. They're more likely to have comparison words for the batch, especially when you look at small vineyards. Often they'll have unique labels for every year's harvest, and they may have three or five types in a given year; maybe you'll see *\"Early Harvest. Balanced fruity and peppery\",* or *\"Very fruity with a peppery finish\",* or *\"Early harvest. Very grassy. Bold.\"* \n\nGo to a good store and they'll have samples to taste to learn and sample what differences are. Descriptors like \"nutty\", \"peppery\", \"grassy\", \"fruity\", \"leafy\", \"floral\", \"thick\", \"soft\", \"bitter\", \"pungent, \"earthy\", are commonly used by different groups.  Again, the finishing oils aren't mass produced sent to thousands of stores around the globe, they're small batch and labeled a few thousand at a time, and as a result tend to get words specific for that batch.\n\nNo matter which you buy, olive oils break down over time and break down faster when exposed to oxygen and to light. Whatever variety you buy, make sure you buy amounts you will actually use before they start to turn rancid.  Blended oils (e.g. the big costco bottles) can go 12-18 months before they start to develop a rancid flavor. Finishing oils tend to go start to change within six months but can list longer.  Early harvest tends to start to change within about a month of opening, and first harvest (\"olio nuovo\") oils are best when used within a month, they're very intense but break down quickly.\n\nI love the wide variety of oils, I've got 6 varieties of olive in my pantry right this second, along with 4 non-olive oils (peanut, canola/rapeseed, Safflower, and coconut).",

Heating it then changes the structure and texture of the egg as the milk proteins heat up.  \n\nPersonally, I don't like changing the texture of my eggs when I make an omelet or scramble my eggs.  I love the actual texture of eggs.. so good!\n\nSo, I use the traditional french method and only add a teaspoon of water for each egg in an omelet.  Water causes steam, like milk, but since it has no protein strands, it doesn't change the texture.\n\nThe extra steam allows the egg to cook a bit faster and more evenly.  \n\nI add water to fried eggs too!  My favorite way to fry them is the way my Dad taught me about 100 years ago.  Add the eggs to the pan when the butter is foaming.  Then pour in a couple teaspoons of water around the edges of the pan.  Add salt and pepper, then pop a top on them, turn the heat to low and leave them alone, checking every few minutes till the tops are opaque and the whites are fully cooked.  Perfect fried eggs with runny yolks and no snotty egg whites.",
