No washing under hot tap, no washing up liquid, no scrubbing...just a spray and a wipe with a cloth. As far as I can see from the edits anyway.\n\nIs that actually a good way to clean a board? And what is in that spray?",
            "Made some chicken spring rolls and froze them for later. Later is now, and I\u2019d like to air fry them instead of deep frying like I normally would. Can I get some guidance on what my settings should be? They\u2019re not pre-cooked before freezing, so I am looking at raw chicken. Thank you :)",

            "Thanks for the response. I should have said in this case I specifically mean chicken breasts. I don\u2019t have the same problem with thighs. That\u2019s good to know, though."

        "content": "I work nocs at a group home for adults with developmental disabilities. One of my duties is to pack lunches for our clients to take to day program. I have a client that has chewing and swallowing issues and has been put on a pur\u00e9ed diet. While her housemates have been getting the usual sandwich, veggie sticks and such, we\u2019ve been giving her pur\u00e9ed leftovers from dinner the night before. This has worked for several weeks.\n\nUnfortunately, the day program has decided they won\u2019t heat up her lunches anymore. Per our dietitian, lunches must contain an entree, a fruit, a vegetable and a snack. Fruit and snack isn\u2019t a problem (we send applesauce or pur\u00e9ed fruit and a jello or pudding cup). It\u2019s the entree and veg that\u2019s at issue. Almost anything can be pur\u00e9ed, but a lot of it is unpalatable cold.\n\nWe have tuna, chicken, and egg salads for entrees, but some more variety would be nice. The bigger challenge is the vegetable. Cold pur\u00e9ed vegetables suck and I\u2019m having trouble coming up with other ideas. \n\nThis client is overweight, so cream and excessive fat are out. It\u2019s a kitchen on a budget, so we\u2019re working with dry herbs, jar garlic, and margarine (though we do keep a little butter around for baking projects). We use a lot of canned goods (various beans, green beans, black olives, gravy, sauces, cream soups, etc). Frozen broccoli and peas. We keep some fresh veg on hand (carrots, celery, cucumbers, mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers, green/red/yellow onions, potatoes, zucchini). My client isn\u2019t picky, but I\u2019m not inclined to give her anything more exotic than, say, Italian, Mexican, or Asian as I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been exposed to much else. I\u2019m happy to prep lunches ahead of time, but I can\u2019t keep any prepared food in the fridge for more than three days.\n\nI\u2019ve already thought of gazpacho, serving it with cottage cheese on the side for protein. Other than that I\u2019m stumped. I feel so bad for this client. She\u2019s never coming off this diet. I just want to feed her something she can look forward to every day. If you\u2019ve made it this far, I\u2019d love some ideas, especially from those with experience cooking in this setting/situation.",

            "I know of a student that had a pur\u00e9ed diet due to swallowing  issues. His parents roasted sweet potatoes and spiced it up with some ginger and black beans. Another favorite of his was baked falafels pur\u00e9ed then added a little plain yogurt at the end. The plain yogurt was always added  in the pur\u00e9e at the end. If falafels are expensive try chickpeas. You could add ground beef with anything as well. Wish you the best of luck- you are a rock star feeding and caring so much for your clients.",
            "I know you said they might not be comfortable outside of Mexican, Asian, and Italian flavors but a lot of curries or Indian style foods have high protein options like tofu or garbanzo beans that do very well pureed and add a creamy texture to the dish. A hybrid pureed panang tofu curry over Risotto probably wouldn't be that bad cold.",

            "\u00a0 Pureed peanut butter jelly sandwiches with apple juice instead of milk or water is fairly tasty.\u00a0 Cheese sandwich.\u00a0 \u00a0 Most canned fruits are good but some will require a thickener added back.\u00a0 Cottage cheese pureed with a lil fruit to thin it out.\u00a0 \u00a0Canned vegetables pureed with a little dressing but again may require some thickener.\u00a0 Green beans wax beans with coleslaw dressing is \"puree coleslaw\". Canned 3 bean salad.\u00a0 Pureed pickled beets but will need thickener.\u00a0 Does she eat the pureed food well or is she adverse? If she's not picky and will eat whatever she may be fine with cold chicken or Mac and cheese etc.\u00a0 \u00a0Pureed canned baked beans are ok.\u00a0 Frozen peas are good. I appreciate you trying to get her some variety, consider calling a nursing home near you for ideas as well.\u00a0 \u00a0There should be someone within your organization supervising a diet like this as most home cooks will not process correctly for swallowing issues and hopefully they've provided you training beyond throw it in a blender.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Well, I know that the lunches go right in the refrigerator when they get to program. I\u2019m not sure they would be allowed to keep it out at room temperature per licensing. We don\u2019t have a thermos for her rn, but we could get one if it\u2019s a solution. But I\u2019m guessing they probably can\u2019t keep it out because of food safety issues. I\u2019ll ask though.",

Also pureed veggies make great smoothies or can be mixed a little cream cheese, milk and powdered ranch. 7 layer dip would be a good smoothie. Baba ganoush. Risotto. Cottage cheese. Salsa, apple sauce, guac and pureed beans like refried beans.",

I haven't used them, but the general idea seems to be that you plug them in and they hot hold your food.\n\nYou might be able to place her food in a little 1/9th hotel pan + lid or something inside a heated lunchbox.  The lunchbox wouldn't be NSF, but the hotel pan would be."
