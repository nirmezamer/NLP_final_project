            "I'm marinading whole chicken leg pieces to have with rice later. My question is, is it safe to cook the rice with the left over marinade in a rice cooker?\n\nI'm basically wondering if a rice cooker gets hot enough to kill all the bacteria in the marinade from the raw chicken.\n\nThanks in advance.",
            "What is the best way to store and open package of bacon?",
            "I didn\u2019t know I needed to soak my asparagus, I just rinsed it like a regular vegetable and roasted it in olive oil. It\u2019s gritty so I think it still had dirt on it, can I wash it a second time and then throw it in the air fryer to heat it back up? I don\u2019t want to waste it.",
            "I bought a lb. of skin-on salmon that consisted of two fillets.  I removed these from the plastic tray they came in and placed them in a glass container in the freezer.  Now they are stuck to the glass container.  I want to thaw and eat only one fillet and leave the other in the freezer.  Does anyone know how I can achieve this, considering that they're stuck to the glass container?  I figure I will have to thaw the container with both fillets inside at once.",
            "I just finished thinning my 3 yr old apple trees.  Is it safe to use the baby apples to make pectin? I am wondering if there is too high a concentration of cyanide in under developed apples.",
            "I just ordered some mussels (St. Jacob scallops) ate like 2 and started to feel that they actually taste strange- like they left a bitter/spicy taste, as if I you'd eat a nutmeg or ginger (edit- i found a better comparison- as if you chew some rosemary leaves) that numb, lingering feel on the tongue. Waiter told me its cause they added some pepper, but damn I know the difference between hot as in spicy and tongue numbness you can get from some things. I know its mostly glassballing here, but how are the chances that these scallops were bad?",
            "I always put it in tupperware. Bacon has a tendency as any meat to oxidize quickly and become grey",
            "I've never had to soak asparagus - are you sure it wasn't just some seasoning making it gritty?\n\nFrom a food safety standpoint you're fine to rinse it and cook again, but it'll probably be overcooked",
            "Could it have been Szechuan pepper on them? That makes your mouth weirdly numb.",
