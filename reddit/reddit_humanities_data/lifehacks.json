I need to shower my kid and myself.\n\nApplied fake tan yesterday and I can't  shower it off so I'm a sweaty, over tanned mess.\n\nHelp me \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd72",

You're not tryin to melt anything. \n\nYour clothes dryer is basically a big tumbly gentle vacuum that vents directly outside. So if you have a new item that's soft and smelling too plastic-y, you can tumble it with **no heat** for as long as you want to get air moved through/around it without all the off-gas just hanging out in your house. You can do it for mattress covers, pet beds, curtains, rugs, pillows, and probably a bunch of other things. \n\nA no heat tumble also can help get excess hair off of things you want to wash! Before I wash curtains or pet beds I give em 30 minutes or so to tumble and get loose hair/dust off so it doesn't clog up my washer.",

I recently discovered an incredibly simple yet effective hack for cleaning your microwave, and I just had to share it with you all.**What you'll need:**\n\n* 1 lemon\n* 1 cup of water\n* Microwave-safe bowl\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl of water.\n2. Drop the lemon halves into the bowl as well.\n3. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high for 3-5 minutes. The water should boil and the microwave should be steamy.\n4. Let it sit for a couple of minutes to cool down slightly.\n5. Carefully remove the bowl and wipe down the inside of the microwave with a damp cloth or sponge. The steam will have loosened any food splatters and the lemon will leave a fresh scent.\n\nThis hack has made microwave cleaning so much easier for me. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you!",

            "See this A LOT these days and I can confirm 100% it does NOT work all the time.  Depends on how \"stuck\" the ring actually is.  Sometimes this can make it worse as the string can become lodged between the ring and the finger and put even more pressure on it.  Nice when it works but you're almost always better off using lubricant of some kind. (cooking oil, dish soap, etc.)  Worst case, it gets cut off.",
            "If I may; I would like to make a PSA:  \nSoft materials are ideal for rings, silicone, wood, copper, silver, gold etc. But hard stuff should be a no go such as: steel; titanium; tungsten, etc. I will say, I've *never* had a patient with a stuck silicone ring\n\nIf you wear rings and get that finger caught in something such as accidently closing the car door on it, first wring your hand and scream, then look at it, then maybe suck on the finger a little, but most importantly; go ahead and take your ring(s) off.\n\nIf you get a cut on your fingers and you notice even a *hint* of pink redness or tenderness; remove the ring(s)\n\nI'd really recommend taking rings off to sleep, but that's just because I'm a bit of a cautious person.  \n\n\nAll the ring cutters I've used are made for soft metal. There have been rings that took multiple cutters to cut because the first cutter broke. I've seen rings we couldn't cut, please be aware that stuck rings can be very dangerous.   \n  \nI'll get off my soapbox now, I just want you all to live happy healthy lives!",
