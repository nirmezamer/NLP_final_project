        "content": "I'm stuck having to sleep on a memory foam mattress at my mom's house (I'm her caregiver). The problem is that when it's warm out, the mattress gets mushy and hot, sagging under my body. I have a disorder called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and suffer from joints that easily dislocate. I'm a side sleeper so when the mattress sags, my hip and shoulder joints get crushed, causing immense pain. I've barely gotten any sleep lately. I can't afford to buy a new mattress or even a topper right now. So is there anything I can do to fix the mattress so it stays firmer?\n\nEdit - thanks for all the suggestions! I'm going to try some out today. ",

            "I couldn\u2019t find anything and had to spring for a new firm mattress. \n\nAsk your friends and family if anyone is willing to switch mattresses? Some people like memory foam (I f\u2019ing hate it).",
            "Put a blanket doubled up between the mattress and the under sheet then hold it together with the top sheet. It makes the surface of the memory foam a little firmer.",
            "I am sleeping on one, too. I hear ya! I alternate between my head being on one end, then the other. Also, rotate the mattress occasionally so you aren\u2019t always sleeping in the same spot. \n\nI can imagine you need a good night\u2019s sleep after taking care of your mother all day. Good luck!",

            "We got a topper when our memory foam mattress got uncomfortable.",
            "Cut out the memory foam.  Do a test first to see what is underneath it.  My guess is that the memory foam is just sewn on top of a regular mattress and a slit at one end would let your remove the foam.   There might even be a seam you can open by snipping some threads.",
            "I actually did that and it does help a little."

I don't usually keep more than 3-5 things in there. If it gets full, and I haven't worn any of the clothes in there again, I'll wash them and put them away.",

            "I prefer hooks. I wfh so my casual wear can handle a few days before needing a wash. Day bottoms turn into pjs for a few nights. Shirts I only put on for an on camera meeting can be put back on the hangers.   I have a 5-hook towel rack on the wall in my closet for the undecided items."
