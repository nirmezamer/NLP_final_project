            "I've been watching and reading a lot of phone reviews lately and been planning on switching from Android to ios, what's the best value iphone in 2024? Many reviews say it's the iphone 13 pro... but I'm not really knowledgeable on ios devices.",
            "Currently have an iPhone 12 but the battery health is at 81% currently and noticeably drains really quick. Apps often freeze for a couple seconds as well. Was planning on getting the iPhone 15 plus. Is it better to get that now or get a battery replacement and then wait til September for the discount?",
            "Hi!\n\nI'm thinking about switching from Android to iOS and I'm curious to know how they hold up on the long term.\n\nSo, for people who still uses an older iPhone (13 and older):\n\nHow long does your battery lasts and do you experience any lags, stutters or bugs?\n\nAlso, I'm currently using a low/mid-range Android and I live in a country where iPhones are extremely expensive; should I get the 15PM now or wait for the newer model?\n\nThanks in advance!",
            "I have an 11 Pro Max that has been super slow and wonky lately. My battery health/capacity says 75%, but I believe it is actually much lower than that. I used to be able to go days without charging. \n\nAre the anticipated/rumored upgrades from 15 to 16 worth delaying my purchase until the new release?",
            "I found an iphone 14 pro max on facebook marketplace (used and slightly dirty) for \u00a375. Is this a scam?",
            "I have an iPhone X.  I want to upgrade.  What should I get?",
            "So my 11pro just took a total shit, the battery has been degrading, but the TrueDepth got destroyed. Got caught in rain this weekend and apparently the water resistance completed failed. Additionally, the charging port is fucked. Constantly disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\nneed a new phone, been thinking of getting the 15pro from costco for 1269 when back in stock as it comes with applecare+ which maybe I should do since I am clumsy. Could also get it from apple, since costco does not carry the blue color.\n\nWas also thinking of swappa, and maybe get a 12-14pro? Thought theyre a bit expensive, checked apple refurbished and 800 for a 12 or 13 pro refurbished is..potentially too much?\n\nWhat do y'all think? I tend to keep my phones for a while but I somehow ALWAYs ,manage to break them around the 4-6 year mark :(",
            "Currently have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with about 75% battery life. It\u2019s been a bit laggy recently and dies pretty quickly. Thinking of upgrading. Is it worth waiting for the iPhone 16 pro max or should I go ahead and get the 15 pro max?",
            "So basically my Iphone X is currently getting outdated, and my parents have given me a challenge. My Dad had an Iphone 13 Pro max, which he had used originally for around a year or two and instead decided to upgrade. I don't really prefer large phones like the Pro max, so im thinking about either trading the Pro max in for it, or my second option is selling the phone somewhere like Ebay or anywhere else.  Its in very good condition, any ideas on how much i should sell it for? Im looking to get the extra money from selling it and buying an Iphone 13 Mini and having that spare cash. However this may take time and i think about just trading it in, although im confused on wether or not i'll get extra money. Getting back to the question though, how much should i sell it for offhand?"

        "content": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

            "Hello,\n\n1. How come iOS doesn't automatically tell users of the battery health going under 80%? I never saw them in both old iPhone 11 Pro Max and 12 mini.\n\n2. How many times have you changed your batteries in each iPhone so far and how long between?\n\n3. How low did you let your iPhone's battery health go before replacing it? \n\n4. Where did you replace your batteries? From Apple? An authorized Apple service provider (e.g., Best Buy)? A third party? Yourself?\n\nThank you for reading and hopefully answering soon. :)",
