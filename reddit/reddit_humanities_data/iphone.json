            "**Hello brothers, sisters, and everyone on Reddit,**\n\nI'm currently using an iPhone 13 Pro and considering upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro. Should I go ahead with this upgrade, or would it be better to wait for the iPhone 16 Pro? Are there any major changes expected from the 15 to the 16? Your opinions would be highly appreciated.",
            "Hello everyone, \n\ni currently own an iPhone 12 mini but it\u2019s overheating a lot so I\u2019m thinking about upgrading but the thing is I love the mini size and they don\u2019t do it anymore unfortunately. My question is, is it worth buying the 13 mini anymore? Or should I get the 15 and that it. How different are they? Need some opinions",
            "So I have 2 phones, an iPhone 7 32GB and an Galaxy A52 128GB. I love my iPhone and the form factor, and I love my Samsung but it doesn\u2019t have that iPhone-y intuitive ui and features. The one thing about my iPhone is that the storage and the ram is pretty limiting. Should I sell my Samsung for an iPhone SE or an iPhone 11-12?",

Which out of these  3 would be the best option. Prices are after trade in, 14pro (256GB for \u00a3425), 15 (256GB for \u00a3489) or 15 pro (128GB for \u00a3515).",

Would Apple be able to save the store credit until I decide to buy a new phone a few years later? Could in also use the store credit on other Apple products or just on a new phone?",

        "content": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

        "content": "I am a 15 year old with a job and quite a bit saved up from it. I have a glitchy but usuable iPhone 11 that lasts long enough before going flat. I enjoy photography and want to buy a new iPhone, ideally something like the 15 Pro, but don't know if it is truly worth it. If I buy a new phone I plan to keep it for at least 5 years and It takes me 6 weeks of work to save up the price of the 15 pro. My family and I are also going to Europe in 2-3 months so if I was to get a new phone it would be good to get one before then so I can take photos. Any thoughts or advice?",

            "I would wait until the 16 Pro comes out in September. Should hopefully be able to pick up a 15 Pro for less.",
            "What about buying a second hand one? You could be saving quite some money that way.",
            "My advice would be to get a phone that you can comfortably afford. I personally don't think a 15 year old needs an iPhone 15 Pro. Heck, I'm twice your age and have an iPhone 13 that works just fine. I'd rather put my money elsewhere. At the end of the day, it's up to you. If you want a 15 Pro, it's a great phone.",
            "I got a 15 Pro about 2 weeks ago from a local reselling platform (40 charge cycles, literally not a single scratch, basically like new, bill included) for 799\u20ac (apples price is 1199 here, 1026 on amazon). So if you don\u2019t mind it not being originally sealed anymore you could maybe keep an eye on those. Be careful to only engage with serios/high quality offers though.",
            "Well I\u2019m still using my 12 pro max. Spot on. All model in between haven\u2019t offered enough for me to change, but the 12 pro max would be good value imo. See if there are any official apple refurbs but i doubt it",
            "Wait for the 16 pro. The 11 is more than enough for pictures when traveling so no need to upgrade that early",
            "I would opt for a less expensive iPhone and save some $ for the vacation. 15Pro is nice (I have one), but actually I found the 13P took the best pictures to my eyes.\n\nLastly, good for you at 15 having a job and getting your own income. Enjoy your vaca with your folks.",
            "I'd go for a proper camera, e.g. Fujifilm X100VI if the goal is to take pictures. It'll serve you for many more years, and can be used in semi-professional capacity.",
            "My son has the 12 pro max and I have the 15 pro currently and I notice zero difference between his phone and mine. Granted I am not going full photographer and spending hours on an editing suite with the pics, just quick edits here and there. So depending on what you mean by \u2018enjoy photography\u2019 - any of the pro phones from 12 pro max and newer may be plenty enough for you. \n\nAlso for consideration. I have had the 15 regular (someone else in my house now has that phone) and I do think the 15 regular takes better photos than the 12/13/14 by far. It is not much worse than the pro lines in photos except for minute little details in my opinion.",
            "I got the 15 pro max and I get like 2 days of battery life decent usage. Your finances are yours to decide. Do you have any other bills or anything that you will owe? Honestly at 15 saving $200 isn\u2019t probably going to impact your life a lot. You aren\u2019t going to turn 18 and go damn. I wish I had that $200 I saved on that iPhone. But u might look at ur iPhone 15 and go damn im glad i got 3 years with a phone i like"
