Society in Russia is extremely racist and xenophobic, especially towards migrants. So yes, Muslims are oppressed in Russia. Some Arabs, fans of Russia, who think that Russia is supposedly opposing the United States, and those watching RussiaToday will tell you that this is not so. Only these people live thousands of kilometers from Russia and know nothing about this country.",

            "There are no such problems in Ukraine. Russia is supposedly fighting \u201cNazis\u201d in Ukraine, but in Russia these Nazis are legal. Sabotage, beatings of migrants, etc. constantly occur against Muslims, and this is done by legal Nazi groups controlled by the FSB. In Ukraine, there is no such thing as Muslims being beaten because of their religion, skin color or eye shape. Racism is rampant in Russia. For example, Muslims may not be given apartments for rent, although they are citizens of this country. Many Muslims are forced into war in Ukraine to pity ethnic Russians. These are simple truths that everyone here knows, but for some reason they don\u2019t know in other countries. To be honest, Western people understand us better than other Muslims."

But the media platforms that act like there is a civil war in Sweden or that there is grapes/murders and such solely because of immigration is of course ridiculous. Id there problems because of excessive immigration on some places? Yes of course, but blaming all of (X) country\u2019s problems on immigration is just dumb. It\u2019s still way safer in pretty much every Western European country (provided u ain\u2019t a complete idiot) than every Middle Eastern country (pls don\u2019t be a nit picky scumbag, I really cba).",
