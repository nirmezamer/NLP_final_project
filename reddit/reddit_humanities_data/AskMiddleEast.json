What has changed to justify this reorientation?\n\nThe answer is that Israel is now seriously moving towards the Lebanese theater of war, and Morocco supports any and all efforts to remove what it sees as Iran in the form of Hezbollah from the Mediterranean. Why? Because their intellectuals, from the days of Mohammed Abed Jabri, have created the idea that Iran, its revolution, and religion have nothing to do with the Western Mediterranean or even Islam for that matter, but only the Eastern MENA, which is supposedly steeped in Gnosticism and latter-day Zoroastrianism and is too close to Hindu India, where some of their propaganda claims Khomeini has his roots. If Iran rises to be a Mediterranean power, it improves its reach in the conversation of civilizations and the battle of hearts and minds. The Moroccan psychological bedrock would be shattered. The Iranian model will undoubtedly reach the medieval kingdom and topple the throne. That is why they will jump on any bandwagon that will push Iran out of the Mediterranean and back across the Euphrates. Israel is leading that charge for its own reasons, and American global power and Khaleeji money are incentivizing Rabat.\n\nWill Morocco send cannon fodder to die miserably in the upcoming war? I am afraid so. I can almost guarantee it.",
