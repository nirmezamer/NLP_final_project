            "Very solid administration and he made major progress for the USA in many ways. I remember when I was 17 and the ACA finally passed, a new reform in healthcare. I remember that the economy was getting better in 2011, and how great things were going that year because it was the year Bin Laden was finally killed. Not to mention the ACA saved my family so much money because when my mom filed under it, we saved thousands in health insurance every year. I just kind of wish that he was a bit more assertive in his administration. You know push for more reform and everything else.",
            "B L A C K",
            "I thought he had a solid, above average administration. His administration was responsible for many victories (killing Bin Laden) and setting into motion some groundbreaking concepts like universal healthcare. I liked Obama's personality and character the most. He was open-minded, conscientious, and very emotionally stable, reminded me a lot of John F. Kennedy. Highly intelligent and educated, editor of Harvard Law Review, well-travelled and grew up in a very multicultural, United Nations-esque family. I definitely think he was the right man for the job at the time. Although I liked John McCain and his experience/character, after two terms of stagnant Republican administrations we needed someone new, with a totally different perspective. In the 21st-century it was also a significant, much-needed progress for us to get a qualified person in office who is African American. I think his greatest legacy will be the Affordable Healthcare Act, and as time goes on it will prove very monumental. I don't know much about misconceptions or where to find info, although his book \"Dreams From My Father\" might be a good place to start. Thank you for your legacy, President Obama!",
            "wait what about the 45th and 46th presidents",
            "I remember when Obama came to office the country was in the great recession, which at the time was the worst economy since the great depression, and this was only 8 years after his predecessor had been handed a balanced budget and surplus. The country was in a stark decline both economically and spiritually. The ethical failings of the previous administration and its high level of incompetence and dishonesty (including outright lies to take the country in war, retaliation against people who spoke up and told the truth about those lies, etc.) made many feel disillusioned about their country. America had stood by and watched as its so called leaders were unable to run the country, and yet they had time for purely political shenanigans like calling congress into an emergency session just so they could keep brain dead Terri Schiavo from finally having a dignified death just to score cheap political points. There were so many things going wrong in the country that congress could have worked on, and yet they made that their highest priority, and it showed just how dysfunctional and out of touch the government had become. The previous president had been given a huge gift of a unified country post 9/11, and he squandered that goodwill by using it to pursue pet projects and a right wing agenda republicans had dreamed of for years with tax cuts for the rich, big increases in defense spending and restrictive polices that oppressed personal rights. So much so that despite once having an unheard of 90% approval rating he barely won re-election just a few years later against a weak Democratic candidate. By October of his final year in office, his approval rating had sunk to a pitiful low of 25%. Morale in the country was very low. Obama was more than just a charismatic up and comer in the party: he instilled hope wherever he spoke. He even made his campaign slogan \"Hope and Change\" and after the abject failures of the previous administration, it was exactly what the country needed.  Those of us who lived through those stark times saw Obama as someone who could restore people's faith in a broken country because of a lack of leadership over the past 8 years. Obama instilled confidence when he spoke and yet his detractors wanted him and the country to fail (and even said so publicly). But once elected rather than fail he succeeded, and they hated him for it. The country was recovering slowly and steadily, and he was doing such a great job that all his detractors could do was complain about him wearing a tan suit, eating Dijon mustard and taking an occasional, but well earned vacation. He couldnt even enjoy a round of golf (something most presidents do often) without being attacked for it. Meanwhile the economy thrived, things were good and even our enemy Osama Bin-Laden, the man behind the 9/11 attacks, was finally found and justice was dispensed. Meanwhile his detractors complained about his wife wearing sleeveless dresses and starting a white house garden. I dont think a president had ever been subjected to such a ridiculous campaign of manufactured outrage, and because they had never done this before with a white president it was hard to thing that bigotry had nothing to do with it. Being the first Black president did bring out the worst in his opposition, and thats a sad truth. The backlash that followed the Obama presidency is not something history will look back on kindly, and its a low point for the country that few deny.",
            "I come from a family of medical practitioners, and they all really didn't like the execution of ACA. They gave me the analogy of having a certain number of children going to school using a certain number of buses, and then adding a bunch of new children to the total number needing to be driven to school...but not adding any additional buses. In essence, getting less care for more money. The rollout was obviously a trainwreck as well; however, more people did get coverage. My family cursed Obama's name for years after that, so that was my main impression. I was younger, so my impression was that he presented well and spoke intelligently, which I think we needed as a country after W's gaffes. From a policy standpoint (aside from ACA), i heard he was the least transparent of any of the previous Presidents in the modern era and that journalists/media were very frustrated with it. Other then that, kind of a mediocre couple of terms.",
            "His lack of a backbone was kinda annoying he let Republicans walk over him Merrick Garland was the perfect example of this there are other examples but overall, his naivete towards Republicans and Dino's was insufferable.",
            "If Obama had been white, he would have been the most \"mid\" and forgettable president in our lifetimes.",
            "More or less same thoughts, overall, I think he was on the upper end of above average, but I think Obama will just go down as favorable more due to what he succeeded and has preceded (as well as his successor in the party making him look frankly better too) rather than being appropriately judged as a whole so far."
