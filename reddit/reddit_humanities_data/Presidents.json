            "I think Obama was an average to slightly above average president.\n\nHis presidency will always have historical significance which I think will usually bump him up in the rankings.\n\nI think his campaign promises were drastically different than what occurred in office, as is the case with many presidents. Hell, GWB mostly campaigned on education and look how that turned out.\n\nHe vowed to end the wars in the middle east. All he did was rename the operations from Iraqi Freedom to New Dawn and Enduring Freedom to Freedoms Sentinel. The Iraq withdrawal was already pretty much set in stone during the Bush Administration. He drastically increased the drone program which as far as reducing American casualties goes was a good thing. And as far as Afghanistan withdrawal I feel like the outcome would have been roughly the same regardless of what year it occurred. And he will forever have props for being the president during the raid that killed Bin Laden. And I feel like the launch of Operation Inherent Resolve was a smart move, keeping boots on the ground at a small number in a support and advisory capacity with minimal ground force involvement was a much better choice than another large scale return to Iraq and initial foray into Syria.\n\nHe navigated us somewhat out of a recession that most people don't feel we've ever fully come back from. \n\nObamacare had the potential to be landmark legislation that got bogged down with the end result being \"meh\"\n\nI feel like cutting NASA's budget was a mistake but I understand it may have been a necessary evil.\n \nAll in all I didn't feel like life was much different during the Obama administration than it was during the Bush administration. I think his foreign policy was much more hawkish than many will admit.His foreign policy was solid for the hand he was dealt with when he assumed office. And his domestic policy was neither detrimental nor anything to write home about. \n\nAnd I understand that much of what he may have wanted to accomplish was fought tooth and nail by his opponents. But at the end of the day when the history books are written, that will never be mentioned.\n\nAnd another bonus of his presidency was the Key and Peele skit with Obama and his anger translator.",
            "Aww, it's sad to see the end of this series. u/Hanhonhon 's answers were always my favourite part if this subreddit, a very informative and generally unbiased look that helped me form my own opinions. Thank you u/Hanhonhon, and to everyone else who engaged in these posts!",
            "Our economy was growing like 199-niiine, the crime rate came down for the first tiiime  \nFor the first time....\n\nFor the first time...\n\nGet it, get it.....\n\nOk, in actuality, TheoDonaldKerabatsos expounded on quite a bit of what Obama did so I won't try to echo here. It must be mentioned that the fact that he was the first black president must be taken into account regarding how far he could go and how extreme his policies could be. I don't want to give excuses on account of the incidence of his birth, but one who honestly studies history would be remiss if America's deep rooted racism did not hamstring how far Obama could go. What leniency he deservs for that I'm not going to attempt to answer, but this phenomenon is worth mentioning.\n\nNo doubt, his lasting legacies are the ACA and gay marriage (via his Supreme Court Justices). They have stood the test of time and despite a near decade long effort to repeal the ACA, has not been repealed. There is near universal agreement (for different reasons) that it must not be the end-all be-all for American healthcare, but it is a step along to whatever America comes up with. And no one since has been able to make the next step.\n\nAn unfortunate legacy was his inability to pull out of Afghanistan sooner after Osama Bin Laden was killed. That cannot be glossed over and he did kick the can to the two presidents after him. One can say that it was due to his over trusting of his military advisors or his need to adhere to some norm, but it cannot go without mentioning. Not to mention his ramping up of drone strikes which has been mentioned in other comment threads. All the surveillance bills that got passed in the wake of the Snowden affair was a chilling expansion of the Bush-era surveillance state that is still toxic to Americans to this day. Speaking of which, keeping Guantanamo open (despite ramping down operations), the desire to prosecute Snowden, and his policy of mass deportation leaves a black mark on his legacy as well.\n\nHis civility in the position is something that is still wanting in the American public. He generally owned his mistakes and even once said in an interview \"I screwed up.\" Unfortunately, his legacy should be viewed as thoroughly mixed and it's a shame that much of the criticisms levied against him were perfunctory (tan suit, dijon mustard, death panels) which robbed a lot of valid criticisms like the once mentioned above from truly being expounded upon in the public discourse. Personally, I see him as a B- president, because it's hard to shake the expansion of the surveillance state from his legacy, while at the same time the effect of the ACA should not be minimized.",
            "Very solid administration and he made major progress for the USA in many ways. I remember when I was 17 and the ACA finally passed, a new reform in healthcare. I remember that the economy was getting better in 2011, and how great things were going that year because it was the year Bin Laden was finally killed. Not to mention the ACA saved my family so much money because when my mom filed under it, we saved thousands in health insurance every year. I just kind of wish that he was a bit more assertive in his administration. You know push for more reform and everything else.",

            "Sadly I feel Obama\u2019s legacy will be mostly defined by his \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d feel between Dubya and Rule 3. Which will end up being a positive legacy, but it may lot invite as much nuanced discussion about what he did both well and poorly.\u00a0\n\nIt is extremely refreshing to listen to Obama\u2019s monologues and conversations now, he was mostly respected by people in both parties, he was willing to compromise to an extent to get things done, he was excellent at explaining his policy goals to the average American. An extremely charismatic leader and one of the most intelligent presidents of all time. What he represented for minorities as the first black man elected to office, without having grown up extremely privileged, can\u2019t be replicated. He did a lot of good to pull the United States back out of the Great Recession with Dodd-Frank, ARRA and other things, even if the recovery was slow and controlled. He fulfilled Bush\u2019s bumbled promise of retribution for 9/11, and he did a pretty good job managing the mess Bush and other administrations left him in foreign policy. Obamacare was largely a positive. He appointed Kagan and Sotomayer, he helped repeal DADT, and pushed to legalize gay marriage.\n\nHe does get criticism for mishandling the evolution of the Democratic Party through the end of his term, but it is not a very winnable war dealing with the vast partisan divide in the media in this day and age. But I feel time will only be kinder to Obama. He\u2019s the only president in my lifetime, within the rules, that I can unequivocally say I was proud of, and that I felt brought a true and earnest patriotism and care to the office. It\u2019s truly a shame and a major indictment on our current political/media climate that he was the prototypical new-generation president and neither party got the memo.\u00a0",

            "Apart from people say I just can't blame him for \"continuing\" wars in middle east or drone warfare cuz he had this options\n1.Do nothing about rising terrorism :\nAmerica invades Iraq, destabilizes the region cause massive problems for all the world and just doesn't do anything to deal with it, it's a bad look and it was indeed America's fault\n2.Redeploy troops \nI think we all know why this is bad, he promised to end the war after all it was a big part of his electoral mandate \n3.Use Air strikes + Drone Warfare\nThis is what happened caused innocent casualties but considering the other options this was more viable \nI am open to any corrections",
            "I thought he had a solid, above average administration. His administration was responsible for many victories (killing Bin Laden) and setting into motion some groundbreaking concepts like universal healthcare. I liked Obama's personality and character the most. He was open-minded, conscientious, and very emotionally stable, reminded me a lot of John F. Kennedy. Highly intelligent and educated, editor of Harvard Law Review, well-travelled and grew up in a very multicultural, United Nations-esque family. I definitely think he was the right man for the job at the time. Although I liked John McCain and his experience/character, after two terms of stagnant Republican administrations we needed someone new, with a totally different perspective. In the 21st-century it was also a significant, much-needed progress for us to get a qualified person in office who is African American. I think his greatest legacy will be the Affordable Healthcare Act, and as time goes on it will prove very monumental. I don't know much about misconceptions or where to find info, although his book \"Dreams From My Father\" might be a good place to start. Thank you for your legacy, President Obama!"

I think Kennedy was definitely one of the better presidents in the 20th century for sure, peace corps is probably the greatest accomplishment he made. Plus his handling of the Cuban missile crisis was pretty good, showing that he learned from his mistakes during the bay of pigs invasion. Also kept a decently level head during the checkpoint Charlie standoff. \n\nBut I wouldn't save him because if he had lived and likely been re-elected in 1964, his legacy would be remembered much less fondly (in my opinion). Kennedy's attempts to try and get a civil rights bill through Congress likely gets watered down or not even passed at all. Lyndon Johnson was probably the only person up to the job to get a civil rights bill through considering he was JFK's VP and had HUGE influence in the senate. The combination of the collective mourning of the nation plus Johnson's cunning made the civil rights possible (once again, in my opinion). \n\nHad JFK lived, he likely would've done much the same as Johnson did in Vietnam, escalating the conflict by sending thousands of troops to reinforce the south Vietnamese. Kennedy would have received the same backlash as Johnson did during his presidency OTL. Plus this could even squander a potential Bobby Kennedy presidential campaign or even just screw over the entire Kennedy family in general politically. \n\nKennedy I feel is remembered so fondly because on his shortened time in office, he did mostly good things. He died a martyr of the nation, a symbol of the times before the turbulent late 60s. I love Kennedy because he was a dreamer that inspired others to sometimes literally, reach for the stars. He has such Charisma that even 60 years later we mostly see him as one of the greats. \n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't save Kennedy, I'd probably save old Abe or something.",
