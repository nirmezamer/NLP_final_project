They looked so happy and their families are so supportive it was so nice to see \u2764\ufe0f they\u2019ve easily become one of my favorite couples. They seem to genuinely love each other and they\u2019re great with their kids too. Also Emily\u2019s dad \ud83e\udd79",

            "Both sophie and rob are immature, honestly didnt see sophie as that bad until the last two episodes. Shes constantly begging to be chased and its such a awful thing in a marriage.\n\nAshley and manuel should not be together. Manuel sending money to his baby mama isn\u2019t a bad thing but he should just tell Ashley that. If Ashley doesn\u2019t like that then the relationship should end.\n\nTotally gonna ignore the mommy makeover.\n\nI love Kobe and Emily though Emily was really annoying with the ex girlfriend situation, i loved the wedding and i love how open her dad is to new cultural experiences"
