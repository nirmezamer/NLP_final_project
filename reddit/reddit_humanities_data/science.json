            "I saw a TikTok talking about how, due to dating apps/social media/constant access and exposure to pornography, that we are \u201cnovelty chasing\u201d when it comes to searching for relationships. We have \u201cstandards\u201d that we don\u2019t meet ourselves and have dehumanized each other to the point where we rank ourselves algorithmically/objectively when humans by nature can\u2019t be ranked that way.\n\nIt\u2019s not suggesting that we don\u2019t have reasonable standards, red flags, and compatibility factors that we consider but that we\u2019ve gone so far beyond that.\n\nJust a TikTok, but it really made me think.",
            "I\u2019ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12929\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nAre all single people insecure? When we think about people who have been single for a long time, we may assume it\u2019s because single people have insecurities that make it difficult for them to find a partner or maintain a relationship.\n\nBut is this true? Or can long-term single people also be secure and thriving?\n\nOur latest research published in the Journal of Personality suggests they can. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, not everybody tends to thrive in singlehood. Our study shows a crucial factor may be a person\u2019s attachment style.\n\nSinglehood is on the rise\n\nSinglehood is on the rise around the world. In Canada, single status among young adults aged 25 to 29 has increased from 32% in 1981 to 61% in 2021. The number of people living solo has increased from 1.7 million people in 1981 to 4.4 million in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, evidence suggests many single people are choosing to remain single and living happy lives.\n\nLooking at our results more closely, we found four distinct subgroups of singles:\n\nsecure singles are relatively comfortable with intimacy and closeness in relationships (22%)\n\nanxious singles question whether they are loved by others and worry about being rejected (37%)\n\navoidant singles are uncomfortable getting close to others and prioritise their independence (23% of younger singles and 11% of older long-term singles)\n\nfearful singles have heightened anxiety about abandonment, but are simultaneously uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness (16% of younger singles and 28% of older long-term singles).\n\nThese findings should be considered alongside several relevant points. First, although most singles in our samples were insecure (78%), a sizeable number were secure and thriving (22%).\n\nFurther, simply being in a romantic relationship is not a panacea. Being in an unhappy relationship is linked to poorer life outcomes than being single.",
            "I can see this getting ever more common, with the amount of people growing up without an example of healthy long term commitment it really shouldn't be a surprise that less people are even interested in trying to form healthy long term relationships.",
            "[removed]",
            "The study makes this sound like it\u2019s a good thing, but it says that 78% are insecure while 22% are satisfied with it.",
            "Time and time again we see economic instability reducing the numbers of people looking for long-term relationships either through them choosing not to pursue a relationship or just not having the time to commit to finding relationships.\n\nWhy would someone choose to get start dating or get married and start a family when they arent sure they will be in the same job/house/city this time next year?\n\nWhy would you expect someone who works 80+ hours a week and barely squeaks by living in a rented place with 3 other people to have the time or energy to seek romance?\n\nCorporate profits are reaching unstable peaks and they really cant cut costs any more without simply returning to feudalism so either that happens, or we see a revolution of young people demanding the end to endless profit chasing.",
            "The study mentions attachment theory in reference to the security of singles. That may play a part, but it would be interesting to see if they're secure financially, have friends or a social life, and how stressful their job is as I believe those also have an effect on what shapes the security of an individual and may shape whether someone's \"attachment style\" changes."

While it\u2019s commonly understood that blinking keeps our eyes lubricated, a new study by researchers from the University of Rochester has uncovered a more intricate role: blinking also helps our brains process visual information more effectively. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study sheds light on how these brief closures of our eyes contribute to visual perception.\n\nHumans spend about 3 to 8 percent of their waking hours with their eyes closed due to blinking. Given that blinking briefly obscures our vision, one might wonder why it occurs so frequently. Traditional explanations have highlighted its role in maintaining eye moisture and preventing dryness.\n\nHowever, the frequency of blinks suggests that there might be additional functions beyond lubrication. Researchers Bin Yang, Janis Intoy, and Michele Rucci sought to explore these potential functions, particularly how blinking might influence visual processing in the brain.\n\nThe researchers found that when participants blinked during the presentation of the visual stimulus, their performance in identifying the grating\u2019s orientation improved significantly compared to when they blinked before the stimulus appeared. This improvement was evident in both the accuracy of their responses and their sensitivity to the visual details, measured by a standard discrimination sensitivity index.\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that this improvement was due to the luminance changes caused by blinks. Luminance refers to the brightness of the visual stimulus. When we blink, the temporary closure of our eyes creates abrupt changes in luminance. These changes may help reset the visual information entering the eye, thereby aiding the brain in processing the visual input more effectively.",

            "Current portable gravimeters are accurate to 1 microgal, \n\nApprox. 1.02 x 10^(-9) g\n\nThe super conducting gravimeter (SG), that isn't portable and needs a stable setup in a laboratory, has a theoretical resolution of to 0.01 microgal, \n\nApprox. 1.02 x 10^(-11) g\n\nThe super conducting gravimeter is rediculously sensitive. One lab demonstrates the SG's sensitivity to visitors by using a heavy iron plate on wheels, that rolled under the SG, which increases gravity. At a conference, a scientist showed gravity slowly in increse over 6 hours at a SG site in Finland, but the increase paused for an hour. He explained it pause happened when workmen, who were clearing snow off the laboratory roof, took a break. \n\nBut the SG doesn't reach 0.01 microgal accuracy due to internal and external environmental noise. Of these sources of noise, environmental noise is the most significant factor. Sources of noise includes rain, snow, temperature and air pressure changes, and wind (which affect the density of the atmosphere and thus force of gravity), as well as more distant sources of artificial and natural noise, road traffic, electromagnetic interference, tides (daily and long term), storm waves (even hundreds of miles away), Earth's Incessant Free Ocilation (the Earth constantly vibrates due to earthquakes, storms and ocean currents). \n\nA large proportion of the literature on SG involves the identification, modelling and elimination, as best as possible, noise. This is how the SG discovered e.g. the Pole Tides effects on gravity, 6mm variation in the level of the Earth's tides near the poles due to the Chandler Wobble, a 433 day variation of the Earth's rotation of 9 meters. \n\nThus, a more precise measurement of gravity will run into the same sources of noise as the SG and limit real would accuracy and precision. They will attempt to identify and remove noise like with the SG. But I'm sure if more precision would help. The SG seems to have hit its limit at 0.01 microgal. \n\nhttps://microglacoste.com/introducing-the-cg-6-gravity-meter/\n\nVerma, S.K., Kumar, N. and Pal, S.K., 2023.
