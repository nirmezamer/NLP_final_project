            "I enjoy being in relationships but I've taken a long break after being in ones that consecutively failed. Focused on myself and my hobbies. Realized I had a bad habit of being a pushover which led to a lot of people taking advantage of me in the past, and unknowingly attracting people with narcissistic/abusive tendencies. I've been better at applying boundaries in my platonic/family life and I intend to enjoy being single until I find someone who hold similar values as me and respects me enough to not try to push my boundaries. \n\nSomething I realized is I'm worthy of peace. And being single has given me so much peace of mind after being used and abused by people who were not worthy of my presence. Now they come back every now and again, wanting to see if we can \"just be friends\". Absolutely not. Some people are legit vampires and just want to such out as much energy as they can, until they get bored and move on to their next target. When they exhausted all their options they come back into your life. Umm. No thanks. I'm happy over here, doing my own thing.",
            "Ten years ago, I almost married a girl who proceeded to try her absolute best to ruin my life. At that point, I realized something. The worst days of my life, all of the most devastating times of heartache I'd ever experienced, had been at the hands of the women I'd been in serious relationships with. Not all were monsters, of course, I did manage to date good women along the way who it just didn't work out with. But the others, and the totality of my experiences with them, helped me see that my loneliest days single are nowhere near as miserable as the dark days in those relationships.\n\nI have not dated anyone for ten years. I do what I want, when I want. After enjoying time with family and friends, I go back to doing my own thing without having to worry about anyone else's drama. I'm no longer paying for two people, which means I have some disposable income that I use to take myself on fun trips, and I can pursue my passions as a profession because I only need enough money for myself. I have lonely moments, but they're just that \u2013 moments. Then the moment fades and I remember what a great life I have. I do not regret staying single and plan to continue.",
            "I\u2019m not dating because I would want a serious relationship, and I can\u2019t have one right now because I see myself moving elsewhere in 2 years. That\u2019s what happens when you move to a bad place for a job.",
            "I\u2019ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12929\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nAre all single people insecure? When we think about people who have been single for a long time, we may assume it\u2019s because single people have insecurities that make it difficult for them to find a partner or maintain a relationship.\n\nBut is this true? Or can long-term single people also be secure and thriving?\n\nOur latest research published in the Journal of Personality suggests they can. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, not everybody tends to thrive in singlehood. Our study shows a crucial factor may be a person\u2019s attachment style.\n\nSinglehood is on the rise\n\nSinglehood is on the rise around the world. In Canada, single status among young adults aged 25 to 29 has increased from 32% in 1981 to 61% in 2021. The number of people living solo has increased from 1.7 million people in 1981 to 4.4 million in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, evidence suggests many single people are choosing to remain single and living happy lives.\n\nLooking at our results more closely, we found four distinct subgroups of singles:\n\nsecure singles are relatively comfortable with intimacy and closeness in relationships (22%)\n\nanxious singles question whether they are loved by others and worry about being rejected (37%)\n\navoidant singles are uncomfortable getting close to others and prioritise their independence (23% of younger singles and 11% of older long-term singles)\n\nfearful singles have heightened anxiety about abandonment, but are simultaneously uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness (16% of younger singles and 28% of older long-term singles).\n\nThese findings should be considered alongside several relevant points. First, although most singles in our samples were insecure (78%), a sizeable number were secure and thriving (22%).\n\nFurther, simply being in a romantic relationship is not a panacea. Being in an unhappy relationship is linked to poorer life outcomes than being single.",

            "I saw a TikTok talking about how, due to dating apps/social media/constant access and exposure to pornography, that we are \u201cnovelty chasing\u201d when it comes to searching for relationships.

            "Time and time again we see economic instability reducing the numbers of people looking for long-term relationships either through them choosing not to pursue a relationship or just not having the time to commit to finding relationships.\n\nWhy would someone choose to get start dating or get married and start a family when they arent sure they will be in the same job/house/city this time next year?\n\nWhy would you expect someone who works 80+ hours a week and barely squeaks by living in a rented place with 3 other people to have the time or energy to seek romance?\n\nCorporate profits are reaching unstable peaks and they really cant cut costs any more without simply returning to feudalism so either that happens, or we see a revolution of young people demanding the end to endless profit chasing.",

You can remain single in the company of someone you care about, for as long as you want. Even if it pisses them off or seems to be selfish, it's not. Don't give up your singlehood just because it seems like the thing you're supposed to do, or fear of being alone. And don't avoid someone you find yourself attracted to, just because of fear of attachment. Your happiness is paramount and must be defended, and it can be shared without sacrificing it for someone else.",
            "The study mentions attachment theory in reference to the security of singles. That may play a part, but it would be interesting to see if they're secure financially, have friends or a social life, and how stressful their job is as I believe those also have an effect on what shapes the security of an individual and may shape whether someone's \"attachment style\" changes.",

            "I'm single and I love it. At 35f, I've just dated enough men who hurt me (physically too), and the people I might like to date don't seem interested in me. I'm also what's called demisexual and autistic, so my behavior and mannerisms are just different. Add to that growing up in a large household where I was ostracized and abused and grew up sheltered, and you have a decent idea of my social skills in my early 20s.\n\n In my 30s, things are so much better. I'm not seeing anyone and haven't been in a real committed relationship for 11+ years. I've dated plenty and at one point during a low point in my life dated a guy off and on for some time who just wanted me to be the side chick. What a waste of time. \n\nI do what I want, eat what I want, watch what I want, do the hobbies I want, and I have NO one to clean up after other than myself and my little sister. It's just a great life filled with so much goodness and good friendship. A relationship would just be extra. I'm happy.",
            "It takes one truly awful past partner to make one really consider whether or not they want to go at it again.\n\nMy ex was manipulative, leeching, coercive, and full of psychological dysfunction.  I was her provider, her bodyguard, her motivator, her social life, her trophy, her therapist, and in many instances, what felt like her father.\n\nWhile I was devastated when I caught her cheating, I've since concluded I'd have been better off never having dated her.  I've reclaimed so much of my time and inner peace.  I've expanded my hobbies and saved so much more money.  I see my friends regularly.  I'm not constantly under a microscope of silent judgment and walking on eggshells hoping she won't get upset about the tiniest of things.  She wasted years of my life, and in one year I've done more for myself than all those others combined.\n\nI'd love to meet and love someone again.  But that sense of trust is gone.  I'm loving myself these days, moreso than I ever have before, and I don't want to lose myself just to fill a body in the bed and have some company after work.  I've spent my entire life since childhood setting myself to be able to provide for myself--minimizing risk and pursuing stability over enjoyment when it comes to my career and finances and preceding education--I want my time to be mine.  To do what I want to do, when I want to.  To build a workshop in the garage space rather than make compromises.  To retire two decades early.  To stay up late.  To face no pressure of doing more than the amount I push myself so hard to do.  To grapple with only my problems that I'm determined to solve, and not to be so burdened to coach someone else through theirs as well.\n\nI miss the good company and the intimacy dearly.  Those early honeymoon days.  But nothing is worth sacrificing what I've built for myself in all the sacrifice I've made to achieve it.  Perhaps someone like-minded will stumble into my lap--but until then, I'd much rather be myself than risk being someone else's entirely.",

Seriously asking because I was unaware of that in the past and it would be interesting to peruse these patterns.\n\nIf anything I would think the opposite with economics and would assume a lot of people would seek longterm relationships out of economic necessity. A partnership can save a couple a ton of money in housing/transit/utility/other costs and I think a lot of people maintain relationships that they would otherwise leave just for economic stability. I think historically most relationships have had an enormous economic consideration, likely larger than a romantic consideration.\n\nThough surely there are numerous reasons, I would think the decline in longterm relationships is more related to cultural reasons stemming from changing social mores, technology, and other psychological pressures from the way society functions, such as the disposable nature of modern relationships, the general hedonism of consumer culture, and social isolation stemming from technology. \n\nThe precarious nature of employment and cost of living is definitely a part of that, as you say, and it is definitely hard to allocate time for a relationship if you are overworked and stressed, great points. \n\nSociology is so fascinating to me and its really interesting how many things can influence the shape of behaviour and civilization despite the many gloomy aspects of it all.",

Not sure where I heard that quote. But it helps to really be present, here, and now. Then you can see life for how it is, the patterns that are reoccurring. Finally, you can decide for yourself whether you'd like to live this way forever, or start the process of detaching so you can find your peace.",

It wasn't pretty.  \nThey sat at home, completely dependent on their husbands, raised the kids, and once those were out of the house, they all went crazy. They lived in their own little bubble and knew nothing about the outside. They just sat in front of their TV, occasionally did some gardening and the only social interactions they had was with other housewives who had the same fate. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

            "That all plays a role and is addressed if you're ever treated for sleep apnea. Since there are so many physiological triggers for obstructive sleep apnea, pinning down what is specifically causing yours can be helpful. So, your sleep position is key. Additional weight is the usual focus since it affects things the most. \n\nIt's just a flaw in our throats. We have this gap that isn't naturally rigid, so if a force is put against it, it will collapse or weaken while we sleep, since it also wants to relax. So, you could just be unlucky and born with too large of a tongue for your mouth/jaw, or too large of adenoids and so on.

All of that cost is way more than 1200 per month. Add to that other medically costly conditions with a high co-occurrence with obesity (sleep apnea, dermatological issues, joint issues, and even things like hip and knee replacements) and 1200 seems like nothing! Don\u2019t get me wrong, the drug companies should lower cost, but it also doesn\u2019t make long term sense for the medical\nInsurance companies not to cover it",

The main reason for THAT finding is that, like with cigarette smoke, inhaling cannabis smoke/vapor damages lung tissue and seems to make users more susceptible to viral infections.\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the OP link:\n\n> \u201cMost of the evidence suggesting that cannabis is good for you comes from studies in cells or animals,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThe advantage of our study is that it is in people and uses real-world health-care data collected across multiple sites over an extended time period. All the outcomes were verified: hospitalization, ICU stay, death. Using this data set, we were able to confirm the well-established effects of smoking, which suggests that the data are reliable.\u201d\n\n> The study was not designed to answer the question of why cannabis use might make COVID-19 worse. One possibility is that inhaling marijuana smoke injures delicate lung tissue and makes it more vulnerable to infection, in much the same way that tobacco smoke causes lung damage that puts people at risk of pneumonia, the researchers said. That isn\u2019t to say that taking edibles would be safer than smoking joints. It is also possible that cannabis, which is known to suppress the immune system, undermines the body\u2019s ability to fight off viral infections no matter how it is consumed, the researchers noted.\n\n> \u201cWe just don\u2019t know whether edibles are safer,\u201d said first author Nicholas Griffith, MD, a medical resident at Washington University.\u00a0",

But yeah it's contaminated as well\n\nIt really doesn't make sense that smoking once in the whole year get  worse outcomes than daily cig smokers.  Other studies show fewer health risks associated with smoking cannabis alone. \n\nAnd especially if cannabis actually reduces severity of symptoms, as other studies suggest. \n\nWhich could clarify why there were fewer deaths among cannabis smokers than tobacco users in the long run. \n\nThe way its being reported seems deceptive \" any amount of cannabis at any time in the last year increases risk by 87% over non smoking groups?\" \n\n Really? If you were to break cannabis use down by frequency there wouldn't be worse outcomes among more frequent users? Eating one weed gummy 6 months ago has that much of a negative effect on my immune system?????

            "I\u2019ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://jcannabisresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42238-024-00215-1\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nA recent study provides insight into the acute effects of cannabis use on cognitive and psychomotor performance, particularly focusing on the differences between occasional and daily users. The findings indicate that daily users may develop a tolerance to some of the impairing effects of cannabis, while occasional users show more significant impairments in reaction time and memory tasks while high. The findings have been published in the Journal of Cannabis Research.\n\nThe researchers undertook this study due to the increasing relevance of cannabis impairment in public health, especially concerning motor vehicle crashes and workplace safety. Previous research has shown that cannabis can increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes, making it the second most frequently detected drug in fatally injured drivers in the United States. However, blood THC levels \u2014 the current standard for measuring impairment \u2014 have proven unreliable due to poor correlation with actual impairment and the potential for tolerance in regular users.\n\nThe researchers found that occasional users showed a slower reaction time after cannabis use. However, daily users did not exhibit significant changes, suggesting a tolerance to the effects of cannabis on reaction time.\n\nWhen it came to gap acceptance, the ability to navigate through moving vertical lines, daily users took longer to complete the task post-cannabis use but improved their accuracy. This suggests a compensatory cautiousness, possibly indicating a prioritization of accuracy over speed.\n\nThe ability to accurately replicate shapes, an assessment of working memory, declined significantly among occasional users after cannabis use. They replicated fewer shapes accurately compared to their baseline performance. Daily users did not exhibit significant changes in their working memory performance post-cannabis use. This suggests that daily users may develop a tolerance to the memory-impairing effects of cannabis.",

            "This actually makes sense. When you develop a tolerance to anything you could pretty much handle it.  Before I got sober back in the early 2010s I drank from sun up to sundown.  I use to have to drive to work with one eye open and one shut so I could see the road clearly instead of it doubled and blurry.  This lasted for a couple months or so. I don't think I spent an hour sober at this point, I would wake up still drunk and that's why I never got a hangover. After a while I could drive to work, better than most of the other drivers on the road. I got pulled over twice completely s***-faced, with the tumbler full of vodka next to me, and never caught a dui. I was let go with the ticket. The s***** thing about this kind of tolerance though, is the effects that you want from a substance typically subside. I've heard heroin addicts and pill sniffers say the same thing. You only get high for a couple weeks to a month, then you're just trying to stay normal and not get sick from the withdrawals. So you spend thousands and thousands of dollars just to not get sick while chasing a high you won't get unless you shoot, or haven't done dope in a couple ofdays.  \n\nI wish I could smoke weed, it makes me extremely paranoid. Especially with the stuff today and how strong it is. So many friends of mine say if I build up a tolerance the negative effects will no longer bother me as much, or I could go away all together. Cuz I just don't have the desire to build said tolerance. Maybe in a few years or down the road, but for now I'm good. \n\nIt's amazing how quickly our bodies can adjust to a substance, but can also flush your system from a few of these substances so quickly that you're tolerance drops. You see that with painkillers a lot. And I think that's an ingenious way for the world and the universe to provide us with painkillers calling because if you get the stuff it's from and make it and it alleviates everything all of the time, he won't be a person",

It\u2019s not really going to matter if you\u2019re permissive or authoritarian if your kid grows up learning and internalising that drinking is an essential part of every social gathering and that they have to drink if they want to have fun/be seen as a fun person to be around, same with how much they\u2019re exposed to non-social drinking as a means to alleviate stress",

There are many contenders for Dark Matter: **(a)** Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) such as Neutrinos, and **(b)** Massive Compact Halo Objects (MaCHOs) such as black holes, to name two of the funnier ones.\n\n* Physicists have tested GR for the last 100+ years by making predictions and observing those predictions, GR has withstood the test of time so it's pretty solid.

Thus, things farther away from the galactic center should necessarily be traveling more slowly around the center so that they don\u2019t fly away. The whole point about dark matter is that things farther away from the galactic center do not in fact go more slowly about the center and as another poster suggested a galaxy may in some ways be thought of as a big wheel, ie things spin with roughly the same period.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The point is that our theory - that things farther away from the galaxy center should go more slowly as to not be flung away from the center - does not match our observations - that things farther away go the same speed and sometimes even faster.

            "Capitalism is based on the developmemt of capital, technology that produces things more efficiently than before. That innovation of new technologies drives the economy forward. The economy grows, things get more efficient over time, eventually things will get so efficient that the cost to produce things will diminish to less and less, and there will be less money to make. That's where we are with digital technology and the electrification of everything. Instead of a monopoly game board made in a factory providing the factory owners with profits, it's a free app available to everyone. Technology is inherently deflationary.  And it's capabilities are growing exponentially. Soon there will be so much innovation and everything will be produced so cheaply that there will be no need for governments or business leaders to own everything and delegate tasks to everyone. Technology will be abundant, resources will be abundant, it won't require some violent revolution, it will be a solution to the world's problems and people will adopt the solutions as a means of survival and alleviating suffering.\n\nGCL Technology's recent unveiling at Intersolar Europe marks a significant advancement in solar module technology with their perovskite-silicon tandem module. This new module has achieved a pivotal breakthrough in degradation resistance, a long-standing challenge for perovskite technologies. Historically, perovskite materials have faced issues with stability and rapid degradation under environmental stressors such as UV exposure and temperature fluctuations. However, GCL\u2019s tandem module has successfully passed IEC 61215 and IEC 61739 testing standards, indicating that it degrades at a rate similar to that of established silicon solar modules. This achievement signifies not just an improvement in lifespan and reliability, but also positions perovskite as a viable material for mainstream solar applications.\n\nAdditionally, the economic implications of this technological innovation are profound. GCL reports that the cost of their new perovskite-silicon tandem module is expected to be about 50% less than that of traditional crystalline silicon modules, currently priced around $0.15 per watt. This price reduction to approximately $0.075 per watt could dramatically decrease the cost of solar installations, potentially accelerating global adoption of solar energy. The tandem module design integrates perovskite and silicon in a single module rather than at the cell level, simplifying manufacturing processes and enhancing the module\u2019s efficiency. Currently, the tandem module achieves an efficiency of over 26%, with the perovskite layer contributing 19% efficiency alone, underscoring the significant role perovskite plays in enhancing solar panel performance. \n\nThis dual achievement of cost reduction and enhanced degradation resistance not only underscores GCL's innovative approach but also promises a shift in how solar energy might be approached globally, making it more accessible and sustainable. The next steps for GCL include expanding production and conducting field tests in diverse geographic regions to validate these promising initial results further.\n\n\n\nChina has become a world leader in nuclear energy, aiming to build 150 new reactors between 2020 and 2035, with 27 currently under construction. It operates the world's first fourth-generation reactor and leads in small modular reactor (SMR) development. China's advancements are driven by systemic and organizational innovation, supported by government policies and extensive financing. Analysts suggest China is 10-15 years ahead of the U.S. in deploying advanced reactors, though both countries are at par in nuclear fusion development.

            "From the article: George Murray Levick, an explorer with the Scott Antarctic expedition, spent the summer of 1911-12 taking detailed notes on the breeding cycle of Ad\u00e9lie penguins. Male penguins, he was surprised to discover, frequently had sex with other males, but this fact was deemed too shocking for inclusion in the official expedition report and it was another 50 years before it was noted in the scientific literature.\n\nToday, same-sex sexual behaviours have been reported in a wide variety of species, but a new analysis suggests a gulf remains between how often it happens and how often we hear about it. A survey of animal scientists found they widely observe, yet seldom publish about, same-sex sexual behaviour in primates and other mammals.\n\nKaryn Anderson, the first author of the survey and a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Toronto, said: \u201cThis appears to be due to a perception of researchers that same-sex sexual behaviour is very rare. We found, however, that it was commonly observed by our survey participants.\u201d\n\nOf 65 researchers working on 52 different species, 77% had observed same-sex sexual behaviour, such as mounting or genital stimulation, but only 48% had collected data and just 19% had published their findings, according to the study in [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304885).\n\nCertain species, such as penguins and Japanese macaque monkeys, have become poster animals for same-sex couplings, but tend to be presented as outliers. The latest analysis highlighted observations of same-sex couplings in many species with no previous reports, including mole-rats, squirrels, mongoose, ring-tailed coatis and various monkeys.\n\nAnderson said the perception that same-sex sexual behaviour was rare in animals had fed into a narrative that it was \u201cunnatural\u201d in humans. \u201cI think that record should be corrected,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I think we can say for certain is that same-sex sexual behaviour is widespread and natural in the animal kingdom.\u201d",

            "This is from a quora page asking what \"lesbian sheep syndrome\" was\n\n>The term comes from female sheep. Scientists studying sexual behaviour in sheep noted that there was same-sex behaviour among the male sheep, but never observed any among the female sheep \u2014 the reason for this being that female sheep signal sexual readiness by standing still and waiting to be mounted. So even if two female sheep are desperate to have hot lady-loving sex with each other, they\u2019ll still just stand around waiting for the other one to make the first move, which means the lady-loving just won\u2019t actually happen.\n\n>Human lesbians have a bit of a tendency to behave in the same way sometimes: if they\u2019re interested in a woman, they don\u2019t necessarily tell her or ask her out or give her a kiss or anything \u2014 they tend to sit back and hope the woman they\u2019re interested in notices them instead of being up front about their own interest. But the other woman might be doing the exact same thing, hence \u201clesbian sheep syndrome\u201d.\n\n>Now, to be fair, this behaviour isn\u2019t exclusive to lesbians \u2014 straight women, straight men and gay men can all be shy and insecure about approaching people they\u2019re interested in playing with or dating too. Literally anybody, regardless of their gender or orientation, can be a \u201clesbian sheep\u201d in the sense of being too shy to make the first move on a potential partner themselves \u2014 but because both gay and straight men tend to be more confident and assertive about their sexual interest in someone, that feedback loop gets broken more often and there\u2019s not nearly as much of a giant collective \u201csyndrome\u201d endemic to the entire group.",

            "Is it because uncomfortable, or is it because there's no profitable insight to be gained from it?\n\n\nThousands of papers exist on horse procreation because horse breeders will pay horse scientists to study horse procreation in the hope it'll result in knowledge that will lead to more profitable horse breeding. Horse breeding is focused on quality, not quantity, so as long as homosexual horses are impacting on the quality of horses being bred, what benefit is there to the breeder in studying it extensively?\n\n\nMeanwhile, the study of homosexual behaviour in rams is studied extensively because sheep farmers care about quantity over quality (I.e. mating as few rams with as many ewes as possible) so the impact of gay sheep on a sheep farmer's bottom line can be significant. So sheep farmers will pay sheep scientists to study gay sheep in the hope the scientist will discover something to mitigate the risk of gay rams to the farm's profits.\n\n\nI'm not going to debate the dubious ethics of meat farmers trying to improve profits by trying to eliminate gay meat animals or scientists accepting money to run studies that may produce knowledge that could be used to eliminate gay meat animals.\n\n\nBut scientists are people too, and they need to eat and pay bills like everyone so they DO need to get paid to do their jobs. So they do have to focus on that which is going to get them paid, which will be whatever they've been paid to study or that which they observe that is sufficiently novel that it will raise their profile.\n\n\nEveryone who deals with horses knows horses engage in homosexual behaviour, so unless someone is going to fund someone to go out and specifically study homosexual horse behaviour, no one is going to focus on it.\n\n\nAs for transferring knowledge gained from studying homosexual behaviour in animals to humans, just remember that gay rams get studied because farmers want to figure out how to eliminate gay rams, so it's probably best we don't start down that path.\u00a0"

            "Press release [here.](https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2024/06/removal-of-ovaries-before-menopause-associated-with-reduced-white-matter-in-brain)\n\n\u201cWoman who have their ovaries removed before menopause, particularly before the age of 40, have reduced white matter integrity in multiple regions of the brain later in life.\n\nWhite matter refers to the nerve fibers that connect neurons in different areas of the brain.\n\nThe findings appear online today in Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\n\u201cWe know that having both ovaries removed before natural menopause causes abrupt endocrine dysfunction, which increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia,\u201d said Michelle Mielke, Ph.D., professor and chair of epidemiology and prevention at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. \u201cBut few neuroimaging studies have been conducted to better understand the underlying mechanisms.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the research team examined data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging to identify women over the age of 50 with available diffusion tensor imaging, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures white matter in the brain. The cohort was comprised of:\n\n22 participants who had premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) before age 40 \n43 participants who had PBO between the ages of 40 and 45\n39 participants who had PBO between the ages of 46 and 49\n907 participants who did not have PBO before the age of 50\n\u201cFemales who had premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy before the age of 40 had significantly reduced white matter integrity in multiple regions of the brain,\u201d said Mielke, the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cThere were also trends in some brain regions such that women who had PBO between the ages of 40-44 or 45-49 years also had reduced white matter integrity, but many of these results were not statistically significant.\u201d\n\nMielke said that 80% of participants who had their ovaries removed also had a history of estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore, the study was not able to determine whether the use of estrogen replacement therapy after PBO mitigated the effects of PBO on white matter integrity. She noted that the ovaries secrete hormones both before (primarily estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) and after menopause (primarily testosterone and androstenedione). \n\n\u201cHaving both ovaries removed results in an abrupt decrease in both estrogen and testosterone in women,\u201d Mielke said. \u201cTherefore, one possible explanation for our results is the loss of both estrogen and testosterone.\u201d\n\nMielke said additional research is needed to further understand how white matter changes are associated with cognitive impairment.\n\n\u201cWhile these findings are important for women to consider before having premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy for non-cancerous conditions, we need a larger and more diverse cohort of women to validate these results.\u201d"
