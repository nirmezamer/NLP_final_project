            "So, Siri will most likely be a more fine-tuned-for-siri-purposes and a downsized version of GPT4o. \n\nThe demo where they had it switch up the tone was absolutely insane to me. The fact that we're at a point where a model can reason with voice, can identify breathing, gender and emotion with voice, and have a model that can modify it's own output voice is INSANE. \n\nFor context, open source is nowhere close to this level of capability. You currently need different utilities to do this, and it does not work as seamlessly and as well as the demos. This makes making assistants significantly easier. I think we may be headed towards an economy of assistants.",

I'm talking basic game mechanics, graphics on a canvas, player controls, even some rudimentary AI opponents. As someone who's dabbled in game dev, I'm genuinely impressed at how quickly we went from concept to something playable.\n\nSure, it's not AAA quality, but for a rapid prototype? This is seriously cool stuff. It really got me thinking about how AI could streamline the early stages of game development.\n\nIt's so sad that Open AI doesn't release the features we saw in the demos...\n\nEDIT: The only issue I encountered is the difficulty to implement the splitting mechanism as seen in [Agar.io](http://Agar.io), it kept failling but it took me less than 15 minutes to do all of this sooo I guess I could of done it with more time & work.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1dl94yl/video/d2z3dt5djy7d1/player\n\nEDIT: Another cool thing, I did this portfolio layout using Sonnet: [https://x.com/phth0nus/status/1804006857729532220](https://x.com/phth0nus/status/1804006857729532220)",

This is for \"regular\" PhDs not studying the relevant field.\n\nAlso, majority @ 32 is generally not how this is to be benchmarked (hey, I'm sure you can do better than 81.3% polling 32 human experts!)
