Like the native image and text integration? It's basically a built-in LORA/finetune using one image. Detailed text in images.\n\nI don't know about the rendering quality, but in terms of composition, doesn't this crush every other image-gen service?",

I'm bullish on the tech, but we still have a long way to go until they can do things like slight of hand magic/cleaning/driving/deductive reasoning outside of their training data. That's not evening mentioning their reliability at tasks they are already better than humans at. GPT4o can probably do my taxes correctly one out of every three times, but I'm still not letting it do my taxes until that's closes to one out of every one time.",
            "If we take into account speed as an important factor, responses from the best AI systems are, for practical purposes, preferable to answers from most humans in many tasks. However, in terms of quality, there is still a significant gap. The reality is that many people are too lazy, gullible, and lack basic critical thinking skills to fact-check or identify issues, inaccuracies, or outright contradictions in responses from LLMs. As a consequence, AI models may appear superhuman already despite their significant limitations.",
