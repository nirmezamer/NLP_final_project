La croix is kinda garbage, but I'm trying to be healthier)\n\nI specifically stated I wanted a refund on the item if it was out of stock. I made sure to select that option and save it.\n\n I backed out of the app and was doing my own thing for a while when a notification came up, stating that my shopper had replaced it. I went into the app as quickly as possible to hit refund AGAIN and within 5 minutes, she had checked out with the wrong item. \n\nShe never made any attempt to chat me or tell me she was replacing it, never asked me what flavor I'd prefer to replace it with (if they had had another flavor that I liked, I honestly would have been ok with a replacement). She just checked out. I'm pissed. \n\nI always tip well, at least 20% if not more depending on the distance of the store...\n\nI contacted support and they told me I have to wait until it's delivered for them to be able to do anything about it.\n\nHonestly I'm over using this stupid app. None of the shoppers seem to care anymore \ud83d\ude14 The good ones all got pushed off the app by the shit pay... I used to get awesome shoppers every time, a few years ago. ",

            "Most of the time I just mark not to replace anything",
            "In some instances it is the speed of the available internet. Both of my ALDIs in Wausau have abysmally slow internet throughout the store either on their IC network or using my cell service. Do shopper may not see the guidances\nBut that is certainly no excuse for not observing you requested refund on that item. IC has this little line that you can SUGGEST an alternative item when the original one is unavailable, but if I saw refund I would only suggest in chat and take a photo of options & let you decide.",
            "I had a fantastic delivery yesterday. Shopper was fast, great communication on replacements. Pre-tipped $20 on a $100 order (15 units including 3 12packs of soda). I had no idea it had started to POUR rain during the delivery. Tipped an extra $10 afterward. \n\nSo many horror stories, figured Id post one about a good experience.",
            "IMHO, your problem is with Instacart. Their expectations for how quickly a shopper should complete an order are entirely unrealistic. They make it almost impossible for a shopper to provide the level of service they advertise and when something goes wrong they just blame the shopper when it fact, they essentially punish shoppers for getting an order right and their training is basically figure it out as you go.",
            "They are both green fruits whats the problem",
            "It's not always the shopper.   I always select refund if out of stock for the items I don't want to replace, but recently several shoppers told me the system asked them to select a replacement.  So sometimes I wonder those other times when some shoppers just picked a random replacement, if it's because the system told them to.  Now I select refund if out of stock, plus putting in comment 'no replacement'.  I use the web to order not the app.   And it's the grocery store's website.  I don't know if the instacart web has the same issue.  But instacart web has the problem of not refreshing the chat message so I often thought there was no response when I chat with a shopper.",
            "Don't forget to tip extra bc it's their birthday /s",
            "I feel you OP and its extremely annoying especially when you are the one who tips 20%+ everytime. Or when they refund something that you know is definitely in stock There has been several times when I have had to have Instacart send somebody else out and they found the item.",
            "Super weird that some shoppers just pick a random replacement.",
            "I now send a message as soon as Im assigned a shopper and let them know replacements are selected, and to pls let me know if theyre also unavailable. Its still about 50% that they actually listen, many times I dont even get a response. But the other 50% the shoppers are great, follow instructions and IC is still much better than using Uber or other apps imo."

            "Once or twice i've caught myself accidentally refunding items before even seeing them. But that's only if you have. It requested a refund if they are out of stock. The way they have it set up now. Kind of screws us if we accidentally hit a button on the phone when we're not looking.. Other than that I like to find absolutely everything.

        "content": "So I placed an order today and had an amazing shopper. He got everything I asked for and when he wasn\u2019t sure he asked and took pictures of whatever was out of stock. The only problem was when I got my order. It was in one giant box. It was so heavy I couldn\u2019t even lift it. My husband picked it up and the stuff all fell out on my porch. it wasn\u2019t the end of the world we just picked it up and nothing was broken. I gave him five stars, I decided not to deduct one for packing and leave him a note instead.  I still upped his tip for being so good with communication. Also I requested him to shop for me again. I want the note that says if I ever do get you again can you please use bags instead of one big box because it\u2019s too heavy for me to lift and I\u2019ll pay for the bags. I just don\u2019t want him to get in trouble for packing wrong if Instacart sees it or do they not really care? He did a really good job and I don\u2019t want it to affect him. Thank you.",

Uber there and back costs more than ordering from instacart and I do not even think uber comes to our location for some insane reason.",
