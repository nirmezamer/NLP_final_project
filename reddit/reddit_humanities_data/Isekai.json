            "Bro has literally no understanding, I know you don\u2019t know but the old testament G-d and the New Testament G-d are the same in Christian theology. Plus you really don\u2019t understand how Greek mythology works, those gods aren\u2019t people they are natural phenomena. When lightning was striking a mountain they thought Zeus was fucking it, when they discovered mathematics they thought it was an expression of an unknown god that existed in a non physical way. Did people make stories, poetry, and plays about the Greek gods? Of course but that was separate from their religious practice and thoughts of them. Think of it like how angels are depicted in media vs the Tanakh (not that you have read it). Ancient Greek people depicted gods as humanoid because they thought was the most perfect form but their gods changed shape all the time and were thought of as something totally different from mortals. Ancient Jews have not and never depicted G-d as human or thought of him as such because they would be stoned by the community. Early Christians saw Jesus as G-d taking on human flesh so that he could be the new Adam so that His death could cover the sins of all of mankind but even they separated him from the Father and the Holy Spirit while explaining that all are G-d but they are not each other which is what the trinity is. Even this only has 1/3 of G-d as a human with powers but this is only in the New Testament.",
            "God is not like the Greek gods, nor is He \u201cbasically just human with power\u201d. He is perfect and just, His justice requires He not tolerate evil and His perfection defines what is and isn\u2019t evil. This is why Jesus came to earth. That He would save us from the consequences of our imperfection and wickedness. That is why His central message was for all to repent and believe in His name. This message is still the same today for all of us, repent and believe, be saved from sin and its consequences!",
