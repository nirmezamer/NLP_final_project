Fuck, we used to nail rapist junk to city moat drawbridge and give him a sharp knife - he had an option to cut his junk off himself to set himself free, or slice his throat. \n\nWhat changes is basically difference between \u201cno means no\u201d and \u201cyes means yes\u201d. There might been cases where someone didn\u2019t consent to sex, but don\u2019t vocalize any \u201cno\u201d or other protest, usually due to fear. New law takes care of those edge cases - it requires enthusiastic consent from all parties involved.",
