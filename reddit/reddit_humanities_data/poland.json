Thank you everyone.\n\n\nHello, an hour ago my gf sent me a text saying she is going back home but driver is creepy. I asked plate number and she stopped answering. I went to her house to check and nobody is answering the door, lights are off. I called 997 and they told me they have nothing they can do and I need to report to a police station. So far I have been to 2 different stations and both are closed.\n\nThis is Krakow. Please help me what are my options. How can I find an open police station?",

            "Contact her family and ask if they know anything, was she using uber, bolt or other taxi services? If two police stations are closed call them again and ask which one is open. They should have someone on call at them. Y oh posted this just after 3am so people are asleep. Try the family again.",
            "If it was uber or something like that maybe you should call this company and ask about any data?  I don't know how it works tho but i hope it helps.  Also for sure inform her family so they would contact you if she would come back.",

            "Dude, think straight:  \n  \n1) Do you have your GF\\`s Google / Icloud password, if yes, try using Find My phone/Device  \n  \n2) you can use said Password to login to Bolt, uber or what ever apps you use in your area to call rides and get more details.",

            "Rape was always a crime. Fuck, we used to nail rapist junk to city moat drawbridge and give him a sharp knife - he had an option to cut his junk off himself to set himself free, or slice his throat. \n\nWhat changes is basically difference between \u201cno means no\u201d and \u201cyes means yes\u201d. There might been cases where someone didn\u2019t consent to sex, but don\u2019t vocalize any \u201cno\u201d or other protest, usually due to fear. New law takes care of those edge cases - it requires enthusiastic consent from all parties involved.",

I see one problem. It's impossible to prove lack of consent if there is no violence and the intercourse isn't recorded. Testimony alone with no other evidence doesn't determine guilt.",
            "Basically now when going to a club you have to bring yourself (just in case you\u2019re lucky) not only condom but also a printed \u201cconsent to sex form\u201d which both parties would sign in two copies in the presence of a sworn notary. \ud83d\ude09\n\nOtherwise there is no way to prove that you got a verbal consent."
