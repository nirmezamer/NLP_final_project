Go to an archive website. https://Archive.md https://Archive.is https://archive.ph or one of the of the other similar alternatives\n\n3. Paste the url of the webpage you want to save in the top field (in the red) and then click save. \n\n4. The page will either start running a script that you just leave running until it has completed the archive. You will know its finished when the url in the address bar goes from archive.whatever/wip/(random numbers and letters) to archive.whatever/(random numbers and letters)\n\n5. You have now archived the site. The new url at the top of the page is the archive snapshot of the page you wanted to save. \n\nArchiving websites, social media posts and news articles is important especially nowadays with many of these avenues of information having the ability to stealth edit or delete the article. Its important to archive these sources as that captures them so that that information as it was released will be forever accessible. \n\nThe ethics of stealth edits and corrections without disclosure is questionable and something that has resulted in us putting outlets in the blacklist which you can view the list of [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/wiki/index/lists#wiki_blacklisted_sites) or in the sidebar. Posts that are not archived from these sites maybe removed as these sites have a history of stealth edits, article title changes, deletions, etc. without disclosure and have had issues with journalism ethics in the past.\n\nIf you do post an article please try and post an archive of the article as a comment so if something ever happens to the original we do have the archive to refer back to in posterity. A lot of sites attempt to memory hole information so keeping receipts is always important.",
