        "content": "How to archive:\n\n1. Copy the web address of the page that you wish to archive\n\n2. Go to an archive website. https://Archive.md https://Archive.is https://archive.ph or one of the of the other similar alternatives\n\n3. Paste the url of the webpage you want to save in the top field (in the red) and then click save. \n\n4. The page will either start running a script that you just leave running until it has completed the archive. You will know its finished when the url in the address bar goes from archive.whatever/wip/(random numbers and letters) to archive.whatever/(random numbers and letters)\n\n5. You have now archived the site. The new url at the top of the page is the archive snapshot of the page you wanted to save. \n\nArchiving websites, social media posts and news articles is important especially nowadays with many of these avenues of information having the ability to stealth edit or delete the article. Its important to archive these sources as that captures them so that that information as it was released will be forever accessible. \n\nThe ethics of stealth edits and corrections without disclosure is questionable and something that has resulted in us putting outlets in the blacklist which you can view the list of [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/wiki/index/lists#wiki_blacklisted_sites) or in the sidebar. Posts that are not archived from these sites maybe removed as these sites have a history of stealth edits, article title changes, deletions, etc. without disclosure and have had issues with journalism ethics in the past.\n\nIf you do post an article please try and post an archive of the article as a comment so if something ever happens to the original we do have the archive to refer back to in posterity. A lot of sites attempt to memory hole information so keeping receipts is always important.",

            "A few things to note:\n\n- https://archive.today is the \"main\" url, it will redirect you to whichever alt-domain is currently preferred (useful if one of them goes down again)\n- archive.today doesn't save everything, e.g. videos aren't saved. youtube _looks_ like it saves properly, but the play button does nothing\n- there have been some problems with twitter not saving properly (the page is a different \"logged out\" version which is purposefully trash in order to convince you to sign up... gotta boost those numbers somehow \ud83e\udd23) only really useful for archiving specific single tweets\n- you may wish to check if the page has already been archived first, if there's a recent archive and nothing has changed then there's not much point in another archive\n- if archive.today doesn't get by a paywall, https://12ft.io/ usually works",
            "Is it just me or is [archive.today](http://archive.today) not archiving anything? Used to work fine until now. It seems to be stuck in a loop where it can't actually properly archive any tweets.",
            "ALL THREE OF THEM ARE INACCESSIBLE. WHY YOU'RE SUGGESTING STES THAT DOESN'T WORK?",
            "Another important point to add is that since the archive only takes a snapshot of the page and not the links it directs to, occasionally a few more steps are required:\n\n* for articles spread across several pages (such as articles on Film Threat which require to click previous/ext for each page), also archive each page individually\n\n* for Reddit or Twitter threads with a picture that is too small to be read on the snapshot and requires to be open in a new tab, also archive each tab/picture individually",
            "Also mentioning https://ghostarchive.org/ as an option, since \"archive\" often simply doesn't work for quite a few people.",

            "is this subreddit pro anti woke",
            "This is unnecessary on archive.today . If the url has already been archived it will redirect you to the archive, and ask you if you want to archive it again or not. On web.archive.org and ghostarchive.org , though, this is correct."

And instead of calling that stuff out for how stupid it is, the whole DA sub thinks that's the best thing ever.\u00a0\n\n\n- Endless praise for a game that just spent 10 years in dev hell, from a company whose latest 2 titles were utter woke trash. 0 criticism in sight, even though the first 2 trailers were dogawful. Shittiest art direction and voice acting I've seen in years.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm sure there's a decent amount of astroturfed \"engagement\" in there, but still.
