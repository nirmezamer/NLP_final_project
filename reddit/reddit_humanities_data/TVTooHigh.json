        "content": "Lots of people posting lately asking \u201cIs this too high?\u201d so here is a quick guide on what is generally accepted TV placement procedure (GATPP) as seemingly defined by this subreddit.\n\n\n- If the TV is above the fireplace, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is angled down, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is mounted to the wall above a TV stand, and the clearance between the stand and TV is equal to, or greater than ONE vertical PS5, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If when standing the TV is at eye level, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some opposite GATPP use cases.\n\n- If the TV is in a bedroom and meant to be viewed from the bed, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV\u2019s only viewing position is in the reclined state, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If you are at a sports bar, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is at eye level when sitting down, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is in the kitchen it is more for listening, mounted high as to avoid any splashes or spills, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is purposely mounted higher to keep out of range of a toddler, you\u2019re a parent so your neck already hurts and IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n\nI hope this helps clear up some questions. If you have any other rules to add, please comment below.",

            "I will also add that kitchen tvs are an exception like households with toddlers.\n\nThe kitchen tv is more for listening than watching, and you want it away from splashes and spills. The only remaining space is up.",
            "Maybe everyone should start hanging their tv\u2019s high to balance out the neck strain from looking down at your phone all day",
            "This should be put in the about and adapted into rules for the sub",

            "if i can\u2019t put the TV above the fireplace i can\u2019t put it anywhere lol.",
            "The tv in my living room would definitely be considered high in this sub but the only furniture I have is a recliner. So when I\u2019m in the recliner it does end up being at eye level cos I\u2019m looking up\u2026 is that fine?",
            "the ultimate rule: if the top 1/3 line of the tv meets your eyeline, without you needing the to bend your neck up or down, it is probably a good placement. (1/3rd line is my threshold, anyone can correct what that should be)"
