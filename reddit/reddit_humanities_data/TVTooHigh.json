        "content": "Lots of people posting lately asking \u201cIs this too high?\u201d so here is a quick guide on what is generally accepted TV placement procedure (GATPP) as seemingly defined by this subreddit.\n\n\n- If the TV is above the fireplace, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is angled down, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is mounted to the wall above a TV stand, and the clearance between the stand and TV is equal to, or greater than ONE vertical PS5, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n- If when standing the TV is at eye level, IT IS TOO HIGH.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some opposite GATPP use cases.\n\n- If the TV is in a bedroom and meant to be viewed from the bed, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV\u2019s only viewing position is in the reclined state, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If you are at a sports bar, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is at eye level when sitting down, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is in the kitchen it is more for listening, mounted high as to avoid any splashes or spills, IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n- If the TV is purposely mounted higher to keep out of range of a toddler, you\u2019re a parent so your neck already hurts and IT IS PROBABLY NOT TOO HIGH.\n\nI hope this helps clear up some questions. If you have any other rules to add, please comment below.",

            "I will also add that kitchen tvs are an exception like households with toddlers.\n\nThe kitchen tv is more for listening than watching, and you want it away from splashes and spills. The only remaining space is up.",
            "Maybe everyone should start hanging their tv\u2019s high to balance out the neck strain from looking down at your phone all day",
            "Good stuff, last one made me laugh. For an actual number, the middle of your tv from the ground should often (with wiggle room) be 42\u201d off the ground. That is accounting for how high an average couch and person is.\n\nExample, a 77\u201d tv is 40.9\u201d tall so the bottom should be about 21\u201d from the ground. But it is fine to have it slightly higher if accounting for a tv stand (many are 22-24\u201d tall). My G2 is mounted with the bottom 24\u201d above floor so it\u2019s about 44.5\u201d from the floor. Not really noticeable from a \u201cis this too high\u201d perspective while it let me have the room I needed. Perfect is the enemy of good.\n\ntl;dr 42\u201d plus minus a few from middle of tv to ground is usually what you want.",

            "This was a hilarious post. But this is a weird sub.",
            "As a parent with a toddler, this whole \"but I have to put my tv up high so my kids don't touch it\" thing is no excuse.\n\nSo what if I have to wipe a few fingerprints off the tv once in a while.  Worst case scenario, mount it to the wall at the proper height using a fully articulating mount.  That way, your kid can't knock it down, and if you want to do so you can move it up and out of reach when your kids are playing in the room.\n\nAs for our house, I just have the tv sitting on a stand.  It's a ten year old 1080p so I don't really care if my kids knock it down and break it.  I've been thinking of getting a new 4k before too long anyhow.  That, I would put on an articulating wall mount.",
            "I only disagree the toddlers rule. The tv is more important. Find a way to keep chlildren far from tv.",
            "Especially No. 1 should be capitalized and fat printed!\n\nEven if it would not be too hign it should be FORBIDDEN by law!\n\nNEVER PUT A TV NEXT TO A FIREPLACE, for goods sake!"
