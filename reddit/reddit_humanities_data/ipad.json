I am pretty much using my ipad for note taking and art only, however I do dabble in 3D models only because I use apps to pose my references. \n\nSome high activity weeks I spend as much as 15-20 hours in procreate and I'm drawing a webcomic, I want to switch over to Clip studio paint to take advantage of their paneling and lettering tools, and some of their 3D assets.

            "Trying to decide which iPad to upgrade from my Mini 6 to.\n\nThe two primary deciding factors, 11 vs 13\" screen and, if 11\", Air vs Pro.\n\nThe 13\" Pro is too rich for my blood, I could afford, just don't think I could justify it, especially since I'm gonna need to buy the Pencil Pro and a case, \\~$1600 is just too much all added together. But I really like the Tandem OLED and ProMotion.\n\nI do:\n\n1. watch YouTube\n2. read\n3. take notes via Apple Pencil\n4. occasionally use it to markup students' essays since I can use the apple pencil to leave handwritten notes on digitally submitted work\n5. draw with Procreate (just a hobby I do for fun)\n\nI do not:\n\n1. film or edit video\n2. game\n3. want to replace my laptop (I have a M1 MacBook Air that I still use when I need to TYPE anything substantial and will probably replace with a new MacBook Air in 1-2 years)\n\nThe way I see these things from an uneducated perspective\n\n* 13\", a lot of people are saying they return them because they are too big and cumbersome. However, the extra surface space would be nice for digital art.\n* 11\" would allow me the option of buying the Pro (or save a couple hundred on the smaller Air). That is far more machine than I will ever need for 99% of what I will ever use it for, but the the higher quality screen would be very nice.\n* I also wonder if the M4 chip would make the Pro SLIGHTLY more future-proof, though I assume with AI stuff coming out, the 8GB of RAM will be more of a future-proofing hinderance than a M2 vs M4 chip, and they both have the same RAM anyways\n\nSo....11\" Air, 11\" Pro, or 13\" Air...",

And an 11-inch costs like 200 less than the 13-inch so that's also a big thing for me. What do you guys think?"
