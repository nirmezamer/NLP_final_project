        "content": "Some background information: Husband (33M) and I (28F) have been together for 10 years and married for 9. We have 2 young children (3M and 7M) and I have just recently graduated with my degree and will be starting my job at the end of July. We have switched off being the breadwinner while the other completes their degree.. This is relevant as he feels \u201cowed\u201d certain sexual activities  for being the main income for the family since I started school in 2019 (I did contribute some money via grants, scholarships, GI bill stipend and I worked during summer breaks).\n\nMain post: Husband and I have a decent sex life right now, though after children and during the use of some methods of birth control, I have had a lower sex drive than him. We have regular sex around 2-4 times a week depending on schedules with kids and stress levels. He says that he\u2019s happy about the frequency but feels that the actual intimacy is too quick/not as lengthy as he would wish, which is hard to accomplish with young children, his work hours, and us both having commitments to school until recently (he is currently pursuing his masters one class at a time). \n\nSo for birthday/holidays/if I want something special, his main request/transaction is to have a day set aside in which he leaves work early and we have a few hours to be intimate. He wants me to go all out with make up and lingerie and spend time really focusing on his pleasure to include having anal sex. I don\u2019t mind doing these things for him, it\u2019s his attitude that becomes a real turn off. He feels that this is expected of me and that it\u2019s the least I can do as he financially takes care of the family. \n\nHe tallies up all the times he thinks he\u2019s owed, for example I owe him anal sex two times currently for Father\u2019s Day and his birthday. He decided this Friday would be the day it would happen, didn\u2019t really ask me just said that since the children would be in daycare, we would be doing it. Fine, I was a little irritated as I was not asked but he\u2019s absolutely insufferable if he feels like I\u2019m rejecting/not following through on these things. \n\nNow, Wednesday I had some time to myself and laid out be the pool. I\u2019m pretty fair skinned and didn\u2019t apply sunscreen as often as I should and got sunburnt. Mostly on my back, thighs, and on my chest. It wasn\u2019t horrific and I\u2019ve been sunburned enough to know how to minimize pain and heal it quickly. But my husband was livid, he said the sunburn ruined his plans and we won\u2019t be having sex on Friday.\n\nAt first, I thought he was worried that it would be painful and I assured him that it wasn\u2019t that bad and I would still be up for our plans. Nope. He said that it ruined how he wanted me to look and he wouldn\u2019t get any enjoyment out of it. I basically rolled my eyes and said that was ridiculous, but he was super serious. So, Friday rolls around and he comes home from work early and just starts complaining about how made he is that I ruined his \u201cpresent\u201d and that if the sunburn turns into a tan, he will be pissed too because he doesn\u2019t like tan lines? I told him that he needs to do some self reflection on why he\u2019s so pissed about this and that he can\u2019t be mad at me for getting sunburnt. He still feels justified in being upset.\n\nThis isn\u2019t normal right? Any advice or input on how to get him to see how ridiculous this is? \n\nTL;DR: husband wants certain sexual favors/acts for presents. He says I ruined it because my sunburn makes me less attractive to him.\n\nEdited to add: after I told him he was being crazy and to self reflect, he sent me a text message saying \u201cI work too hard to not get want I want, god forbid I have preferences.\u201d \n\nEdit #2: Okay, thank you everyone for weighing in. To address some points:\n\n1. He wants anal/dressed up sex for presents or in return for buying me an expensive item because he says sex is the only way he feels loved (raised by emotionally unavailable grandparents), I don\u2019t have my own money to buy the material gifts he does want, he hated any gifts I did buy him (to the point of insulting me all Christmas Day one year and making me cry), and I should WANT to give him special sex if I love him.\n\n2. I don\u2019t actually really enjoy doing it. It feels like I\u2019m a sex worker, which is not something I\u2019m personally into. I feel used and literally have to pretend the whole time like I\u2019m enjoying it. I do enjoy regular normal sex though.\n\n3. Yes, there are many other red flags that I didn\u2019t want to include in the original post as I wanted to be fair, I guess? I haven\u2019t left because I\u2019ve been financially reliant on him, we have children, and I have no support system near by. All my friends and family live states away and I worry about getting full custody in order to move away. I\u2019m realizing that I need to be making myself financially independent and leave sooner rather than later.",

        "content": "\nI (32M) have been married to my wife Kate (30F) for 4 years, together for 9. Our relationship has been amazing, loving and supportive. We have good communication, hardly ever argue and our bedroom life has gone from strength to strength over the years. We discussed cheating in the past and I was always clear that we would be over if it ever happened.\n\nKate went home to visit her family last weekend which was fairly normal. Before she left on the Friday night, we had a minor argument about keeping the house tidy so our communication was limited on Saturday but I knew she was going out to meet some friends at a bar. I trusted her 100% so didn't think anything of it. \n\nBefore I fell asleep, I text her saying that I hope she had a nice night. When I woke up on Sunday morning I had a missed call from Kate at 4 am so I immediately called her to check if she was okay but no answer. After a few hours I tried again a few times but still no answer. Around an hour later I got a message saying she was fine and was driving back soon. \n\nKate got home late afternoon and looked awful. She had clearly been crying, was not wearing any makeup (unusual for her) and looked like a shell of a person.\n\nI knew right away something was wrong but she wouldn't let me hug her and would barely speak. I sat her down on the couch and made her some tea. I gently encouraged her to tell me what was wrong and she burst into uncontrollable tears for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to comfort her.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me, stopping every few words, that she had slept with someone last night after the bar. \n\nAt that moment, something in my brain broke. I can't describe it any other way. I immediately got up and jumped in my car and drove off. I went to a park and walked around it for about an hour. Kate was calling my phone constantly and I turned it off.\n\nWhen I got home, I grabbed two suitcases from the garage and went to our bedroom. I threw some of Kate's clothes and shoes into them and left them by the front door.\n\nKate was lying on the floor in the living room, curled up into a ball sobbing. I called her best friend who lives nearby and told her that Kate needed a place to stay and a ride to her place and that Kate could explain everything to her later.\n\nI told Kate I was leaving for an hour and that her friend was coming to pick her up. She grabbed on to my legs trying to stop me from leaving. When I returned home again, Kate was gone and so were the cases.\n\nOn Monday, with a clearer head, I answered one of Kate's many calls and told her that I needed her to send me an email with as much details as possible of that night and if she leaves anything out, there will be no hope of reconciliation. I received this email on Monday night but still haven't opened it.\n\nSince then, everyone has been trying to contact me but I have just been working, exercising and sleeping. One of her friends turned up at my house with an attitude demanding an explanation, I told her to speak to Kate and closed the door in her face.\n\nI have also been speaking to divorce lawyers, have moved money into separate accounts and blocked Kate and all of her friends on everything.\n\nEverything I have done since I found out seems like I have been on autopilot. I don't feel angry, upset or overly emotional. Just numb.\n\nKate posted a note through the door yesterday asking me to meet tomorrow but I'm conflicted.\n\nShould I meet her? Will it change anything? Is there any point in trying to reconcile?\n\nIs it normal to feel like a robot and how do I snap out of this?\n\nEdit: I just want to add that when I came home the first time, Kate confirmed it was consensual. She was drunk but knew what she was doing.\n\n\nTldr: wife cheated out of the blue and I have been going through the motions since finding out",

We've both had sex together before (we pretty much hooked up on our first date) but I've never shown any interest in anything non-vanilla.\n\nSo earlier today I had sent a google drive file to my bf. He's taking an elective class that he's struggling in, and luckily enough I had happened to take the same class back when I was getting my bachelor's degree. Plus, I'm a total hoarder when it comes to stuff on my devices so I had still kept the same notes I took years ago in a folder.\n\nSo I sent it to him thinking it was nothing. turns out my dumbass had accidentally sent him my folder of men's armpits and gay armpit porn\ud83d\udc80. I realize I had fucked up when I named the file something inconspicuous which caused my own self to mix it up with actual school notes.\n\nAbout an hour after I sent it to him he must've finally check the folder and texted me that I must've sent him the wrong one.\n\nI was so embarrassed and still am a hours later, I didn't reply and just deleted my earlier messages where I sent it to him. I haven't talked to him or checked up on him since\u2014 it's been over 8 hours. This feels worse than walking into class naked. I've never really been open about my fetish even though I knew I had it when I was dating my ex for over 4 years. And considering we haven't been together for long this might be the reason we break up. I don't know how to address this or even if I should. And the worst part is, there's no way he'll forget this since I fucking flashed him with videos of men biting each other's armpits naked. I'm mortified at what he thought when he opened the file. \n\nSo, any advice for how to apologize? move forward? explain it to him? Please I have no idea what to do here I'm at a lost for words.\n\ntl;dr\n\nI accidentally exposed my armpit fetish to my partner, now I'm very worried about what we thinks of me",
