What if you do have a boy, your existing\u00a0 daughter will be pushed aside for her brother because his dick inherently makes him better?\n\n\nHis parents *have* multiple girls and one boy!!

I'd start with never having another child with him. And I would seriously and critically observe what your child has been exposed to - as should be evident, sexism can be highly insidious, and make no mistake, she is absorbing *all* of this shit.\n\n\nI won't scream divorce... but look at what you're up against, and fight accordingly. Your daughter is the one who's in the middle of a sane human (you) and a barrage of sexism.\n\n\nIf you haven't, start *now* talking to her about gender and gender expectations (and how they're fucking stupid).

He has no way of knowing that will occur. \n\nHaving an entire child just to keep a surname going is completely selfish and ridiculous. He has no idea, can't possibly conceive of what he is asking of you by asking that you have another child. Easy for him to do, he doesn't have to carry or give birth to it. Not to mention the biggest part of this: there is absolutely no guarantee it will even be a boy. What happens then?

        "content": "My wife and I (both 38) have been married for about 12 years and have 2 kids in elementary school. She's the love of my life, and everything you read below should be rooted in the fact that I love her and I'm trying to be a good husband to her.\n\nSo basically I pulled an Abed from Community...I started becoming concerned that my wife was bipolar because she would sometimes be extremely energetic and fun and sexual and just kind was this force to be reckoned with. Other times, she would become so argumentative and standoffish and unstable but also withdrawn and depressed that I worried she might do something to hurt herself. She always chalked it up as depression symptoms.\n\nI love her so much, and it was obviously not fun for me to become her figurative punching bag, but I always had hope because of the other person she could be. So in a moment of frustration after being told that what I was describing in a fight about her behavior wasn't even happening, I decided I was going to track some of her behaviors for a year to see if I could learn anything that might help and to make sure I wasn't making this up. I didn't want a \"gotcha\", I just wanted to see if I really was remembering things inaccurately because I felt like I knew what was going on but the gaslighting about my own memory was effective.  As I've alluded to, I basically ended up tracking her cycle. From the time her period ends until maybe 10 days after, our average sex frequency is daily and hot. She gets a lot accomplished, and if anything she's too ambitious about the number of projects she takes on.  House projects, volunteering stuff, visiting a friend who's lonely, organizing family outings or extended family events...it's like she has more energy than time to accomplish everything she wants to do. She's a wonderful wife and mother, showing lots of love and affection.  I'd marry that woman twice. For the other 20 days a month, we have a sexless marriage. She's kind of just getting by emotionally, at best. She works out less and she is moodier. In the week leading up to her period, she's borderline abusive. I try to get the kids out of the house as much as possible so they have fewer hours with her and generally just stay away from her. If she was always that person, I'd divorce her, but I know that it's just cyclical now. Knowing about how she changes through a 30 day cycle has made me a better husband and better at anticipating her needs, although like Abed, I think it would be creepy to explain how I got so much more thoughtful.\n\nSo I'm not the first guy to notice that his girlfriend or wife is harder to be around at certain times of the month, and I'm trying not to be a neanderthal here.  I've got some life experience, I've been in other serious relationships, and I'm a caring and loving husband: this isn't normal. Her swings through the month are a much, much wider variance than most people experience. Your average person seems to maintain who they are from week to week with just a little change up or down, but she's like 2 or 3 different human beings over the course of a cycle.\n\nShould I be worried about her health? If I should, is there a way to make these worries known without sounding like a psycho who tracked his wife's cycle? I do think this has gotten worse as we aged and after she had our 2 kids. I wonder if becoming a mother led to some PPD and some knock-on effects, but I've never heard of \"period onset biopolar disorder\" which is what I feel like I'm experiencing.\n\nHow can I take this random information I know and be the most helpful / least off-putting about what i know?\n\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR: My wife is a good person overall who demonstrates wild mood swings.  I started tracking things to see if I was crazy...fights, times she initiated sex, times she snapped at the kids, times she did random acts of kindness, etc. and realized I was tracking her cycle and her actions line up perfectly.  What do I do with this information to be the best husband?",

            "Look up Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and see if any of it resonates with you. I have it and during the luteal phase ( the period after ovulation up until the start of menstruation)  I am a completely different person. I however have a tendency to self isolate during this time because my mood is so bad I know I will be horrible to people I care about. I get wildly depressed, anxious, irritated, don\u2019t want to be touched, can\u2019t sleep, and sometimes straight up suicidal. \n\nI\u2019m fine now after getting my hormones regulated. You wife might not have PMDD at all but it definitely is tied to the hormone fluctuations people have during their period. She needs to see someone. It\u2019s really\nCommon for people with PMDD to attempt suicide, and it often isn\u2019t picked up/diagnosed until this happens.\n\nIt\u2019s also not fair on you or your kids.",
            "I will agree that it sounds like PMDD. I will also warn you that it is difficult for doctors to recognize and therefore difficult to get treatment for. It took me doing the research myself and then going to the psychiatrist, primary care doctor, and gynecologist before I got any help. So don't be surprised if you go to your wife and she says that the doctor didn't see anything wrong. She might need your tracking before they take her seriously.",
            "I have PMDD. Exact same situation. Psychiatrist had my mom track my moods to see if I was bipolar. Mapped exactly to my period.",
            "PMDD is real and it can get worse during perimenopause, as your hormone levels drop (ask me how I know!) I can now tell when I'm two days out from my period starting because I get spikes of white-hot rage, severe enough that I actually worry that I'm going to go HAM on someone and lose my job, it's so strong and barely within my control. Then the day after my period starts it's gone like nothing happened.",
            "My husband noticed the same thing about me. he asked me to mention it to my OBGYN. Really pissed me off, but I did. My doctor ordered all kinds of blood tests. Turns out, I have high prolactin levels, which need to be monitored by MRIs and a neurologist to routinely rule out pituitary cancer. \n\nI'm on meds to lower it, and my moods have stabilized. \n\nIf you see something, say something.",
            "I can also add that at her age, perimenopause is a real struggle, she can have her hormone levels checked and at least have awareness of where she is at. Some women start perimenopause around 40! I understand you are struggling, but she is probably also struggling with the intense hormonal changes that happen to women at this stage in their life. Good news is that these things level out after menopause I\u2019ve heard",
            "The one thing I'll say here is - I (f) have always been exceptionally stable across all cycle phases. My mood or outward expression never changed. UNTIL one month I had some sort of hormonal imbalance and OH MY GOD did I have a tough time. I thought women were exaggerating, but I get it now - I cried multiple times per day over really stupid shit (like my dog won't come when I tell him to come), when normally I cry once every couple of years. \n\nI can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to live with such mood swings every month, and I think she should look into it so it can get better, both for her and your sake.",
            "Hi! I have PMDD. My doctor prescribes a low dose SSRI for me to take for 14-ish days and it helps a lot with the mood swings. I take it from ovulation until the start of my period. It\u2019s been super helpful at keeping me level-headed and it feels low committal cause I don\u2019t have to be on it 24/7 and I can skip a month if I want to be able to drink or whatever for an event or vacation.\n\nI worry therapy won\u2019t be helpful because it literally feels like you\u2019re going insane. Also, you can\u2019t really tell it\u2019s happening until your period starts and you\u2019re like OH that\u2019s what that was. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s noticing the swings as well. \n\nCome at her with kindness and understanding because that\u2019s what she needs. Give her a lot of reassurance. Men don\u2019t usually experience having 4 different moods per month so be mindful if you try to compare yourself to her. Women\u2019s bodies are complex. Ask her what she thinks could help and share other options that she might not know about.",
            "You share this information with her in a productive and supportive manner. You offer to support her in determining if these variances are beyond the range of being healthy and if she needs support. \n\nThere may be small changes that can help. Issues with diet, sleep, etc. \n\nAlso, be aware that women\u2019s health care is a sad, depressing and neglected corner of medicine. It\u2019s full of ignorant, gaslighting jerks who delight in throwing up their hands and declaring the women seeking help as hysterical, imagining things, exaggerating, etc. It\u2019s pretty daunting. \n\nShe lives in her body. She likely knows that her cycle makes her life challenging. It does for many women. This is what it\u2019s like living in a world that prioritizes men\u2019s healthcare and uses it as the \u201cnorm\u201d/baseline.",
            "Sounds like PMDD to me. Have you guys discussed her fluctuating behavior in the past? Honestly I would just tell her you notice that it comes and goes monthly, more or less, and maybe it\u2019s worth talking to her doctor about. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell her you tracked it specifically. Maybe suggest she track her mood? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy a husband would notice cyclical behaviors. \n\nYou also have every right to stand up for yourself and your kids, regardless of cause it is not okay to be mean or cruel to the family. It\u2019s okay for you to tell her it\u2019s time for her to look for some answers here."

SIL told him off. \n\nSo last night when I visited SIL now in her 80s and she asked a direct very surprising question I told her we were divorced in the 90s and he was nasty and cruel and stole from me and fooled me into lending him money and stuck me with his debts, what can I say, Im stupid and I know it. I paid his debts when I could not prove they were his not mine and lent him money so he could buy a car to get to work, never repaid of course. I got a loan for the car when I got a job.\n\nIn laws thought he was living with us and paying everything. Children never got so much as a birthday card, no presents, no pocket money from ex unless one of his girlfriends was around then he would make a big fuss in front of them and give them money.\n\nBrother in law is living in  a Retirement Home now.\n\n SIL is living alone so visiting her has been weird as I didnt want to upset her but do like her and wanted to know why they were so weird and rude to me. I never did get up the courage to  ask a direct question, thats why I like SIL, she is very forthright and did ask a question which led to this discovery.\n\nI visited last night on my own. SIL is discrete enough not to ask a question when her hubby or my children were present. \n\nMy daughter was not with me when I visited last night. I told my daughter what SIL said when I got home.\n\nWe are both reeling and so is SIL.\n\nNow my daughter wants to phone BIL and make sure he knows I am not a B\\*tch.\n\nDaughter is very relieved as now she knows it was her dead ( Freudian slip Im keeping it , I meant to write dad not dead) telling more lies and maybe her aunt and uncle might be decent people who stayed away due to her dads lies not because they didnt care.\n\nSo many years of resentment and anger due to exs lies.\n\nWaiting now to see if BIL says anything or will just brush it off.\n\nVery glad I never threw out the tapes of EXs threats. Now I have to check they work as they are ancient.\n\nBIL thinks his brother was the best thing ever on this planet so I doubt he will believe he was anything less.Writing as I needed to vent and organise my thoughts ( not sure it worked im still confused and reeling) \n\nIm in my 60s now and had a hard life. I just want to sort things out, have lies about me settled and maybe have a nice uncle and aunt for my children even if they are not young anymore.\n\nMy daughter wants my BIL to apologise to her mother for being rude to me at her dads funeral. BIL met my daughter for the first time since she was a baby at the funeral and was very weird with her, I can see why now as daughter was not upset her \"loving father\" was dead.

            "A little confused why you are surprised. This guy mistreated you and your little ones on all levels, it's in line that he also lied about his (and your) actions when you finally left. The whole point was revenge on you, including cutting off any help any family could offer. \n\nSince you are still so high up in the emotions and so are your kids, see where this goes with the ex relatives. Overall, you'd probably all be better off in counseling and finding your closure there though. Your BIL has had certain opinions for all this time, your ex is dead, your kids are now grown... it's no longer time they will want to get back. The moment to ask was when their sibling died and his kids were fatherless, and they would rather believe you were a horrible person instead of inquire. Big chance that you won't be getting any of the acknowledgement you're hoping for. So reach out to your supports and build up again from there.",

I feel like he used it to pump and then maintain the erection for someone else. \n\nTL;DR: does anyone have any experience using these devices for maintenance or is it a good chance he is lying? ",

            "Honey please.\n\n\nEven if he WASN'T lying, he took sex toys on a work trip??? Like, absolute best case read here, he's a massive idiot. But you, I, and everyone else in the goddamn world know he's lying.",
            "I mean he's had them for months and you've never used them? Have you been intimate in that time?",
            "Meh, he could just be masturbating. This isn't a smoking gun, that would be a condom. I use a cock ring sometimes by myself.",
            "I\u2019m late to this, but hopefully you still read the comments. What I see in the comments reminds me of older family members, who are convinced that someone is a drug addict if they smoke weed (once), but see no issue in drinking alcohol every day.\n\n\nThere is no way of telling what your boyfriend used a cock ring and penis pump for. But both of these objects are commonly used for penis exercises. There are a few communities here on reddit where you can read about it. The fact you don\u2019t see him using it in your personal life makes me suspect this is what he does with it. I own both things as well and never use them for sex (or what some people have insinuated, to prepare for sex). It\u2019s also slightly embarrassing. The fact you say he has a large penis is completely unrelated to how he feels about it. \nGoogle \u2018penis exercise pump reddit\u2019 and look at the results.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m obviously not saying he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, in the end you will know best. Hope you two can have a good conversation to clarify everything.",
            "It sounds like he is ashamed of masturbating with these with you - and is seeing the trip and chance to play without judgment. He may also be trying to increase the size of his junk (which is stupid, the human body doesn't work that way, but guys are incredibly insecure about penis length).",
            "I used to work out of town a lot and have brought those very things with me to masturbate. It seems weird that he wouldn\u2019t have just said that though. BTW PDE5 inhibitors work so much better than all of the gadgets.",
            "Some online medical advice says penis pumps help keep an erection. For example: https://youtu.be/fb0LCD0CXRE?si=swN_L6zKxcysJbIY\n\nBased on your comment, I don\u2019t know that this is the goal of your husband.\n\nListen to your heart.\n\nGood luck.",
            "You say you \u201cfound\u201d these devices/toys two months ago. So he wasn\u2019t even honest with you about them from the get go. You don\u2019t hide things unless you actually have something to hide. In a normal, healthy relationship they would just be like \u201chey, I\u2019m gonna get these, I think they\u2019ll help our sex life.\u201d But no, he hid it from you. There\u2019s a reason why. I would have called bullshit then and there.\n\nNow he\u2019s taking them on work trips? How long are these work trips? Most work trips are a few days or a week at most. Surely he can survive without his precious penis pump for a few days. But nope. He\u2019s gotta take them. It\u2019s very clear why. They\u2019re not for him to use solo. They\u2019re for him to use with someone else. Sorry to be blunt.",
            "Is there some reason he would be resistant to telling you he wants to wank on his rock hard penis for a few hours in his hotel room after a hard days work? Because that is most likely what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d bet money on it.",
            "So, reading the comment section, Reddit, in all it's wisdom, has condemned this man. I would like to know if any women take their sex toys with them even to a work trip? Do you suppose sexual needs don't arise while working? So, he didn't tell you about the toys. Maybe he was afraid you'd react like you are reacting. Maybe he was embarrassed as even in modernity, men with sex toys are considered an oddity. If my lady friend took her toys with her on a work trip or even vacation, I wouldn't think a damn thing about it."
