My daughter is more fussy at nighttime and it\u2019s hard to settle her down. It was late last night, I handed her over to him to catch a break and see if maybe he can soothe her. Her screaming got more intense and something felt off so I went and got her. After I got her to settle, he admitted he pinched her because he was upset. I told him to go to bed and I cared for her and slept in the living room & didn\u2019t go to bed. Now I\u2019m so sad. I told him this morning that she is unable to understand cause and effect on that level. You can\u2019t punish a newborn into a favorable behavior. \n\nI\u2019m so sad, I feel bad that that\u2019s her dad & he would do that to her, I lost respect for him, I lost the desire to be with him, & I feel like moving in with my parents. I\u2019m upset, I\u2019m hurt, and I wish things were different. I don\u2019t think I can trust him. ",

            "I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I don't understand how a grown adult man thinks pinching a two week old infant is helpful. \n\nVery concerning, but at least you're discovering this early and you can take action. Trust your instincts.",
            "My dad used to pinch me like that as a baby. It took my mom a couple of years to leave him but when she did he got to the point of literally strangling my brother who was about 10 at the time(not his son). But uh yeah itll get worse if he doesnt get help since leaving isnt always an option for everyone please force him to go to therapy.",
            "If he can't handle himself with a crying newborn how's the next 18 yrs going to go? Big red flag to me. Completely helpless baby, and he pinches her, disgusting.",
            "He hasnt even been a parent for 14 calendar days and is already harming your child. I wouldnt feel safe with him around your daughter either. Move with your parents ASAP.",
            "You have to leave. Your child is in danger. Shaken baby syndrome is real. This was MINUTES of crying that it took him to abuse her, what will happen when hes completely sleep deprived and you need to go somewhere for an hour or more? Your child is NOT SAFE.",
            "I'm so sorry OP but this is more than concerning: You should never leave him alone with your daughter, and should make plans to part ways. No sane parent would think it appropriate to pinch a 2 week old for any reason whatsoever. This betrays much deeper issues and a lack of self-control which could prove to be extremely damaging to her. Do not sleep on this.",
            "I really hope this is fake. Pinching a newborn is abuse. This would make me extremely concerned about leaving him alone with the baby and honestly I would be out of there. He would not be left alone with the baby again. Its a slippery slope into something more serious like shaking the baby to make it stop crying.",
            "He. Is. Not. To. Be. Trusted. \nHe does not have maturity or insight. \nHe is now a child abuser.",
            "If he is willing to do even minimal violence to a two week old, hes capable of more. I would be moving. \n\nFor the record, I left my own husband for similar reasons. I have never regretted it."

            "You are very young and it doesn't sound like you are equipped to care for a child. I wouldn't have been either at 15. There is nothing selfish about giving your baby a chance at a better life. Don't fool yourself that it won't be hard though. Even though logically, you know you are doing what's right, it could be emotionally difficult and it wouldn't hurt to be prepared to seek counseling if you go forward with this choice.",
            "as somoene who was adopted and has an adopted sister from birth. You arent selfish. you want to give your child a better life since you know you arent equiped to raise her properly. Your not just doing yourself  a favour but your kid. DO it. ignore what anyone else trys to tell you. Its your life take control of it",
            "You are not selfish at all for considering adoption! Adoption and parenting can both be wonderful options (though each has its own challenges), and whichever choice you make is completely valid. Sending you love as you figure things out ",
            "Actually it's the least selfish thing to do. My daughter just had a baby at 19. She's struggling. I couldn't imagine her being 15 and doing it. With that said it's not that I think a 15 year old can't do it but it would definitely be a sacrifice and allot of growing up. Only you can decide if you think you are capable. What is the arrangements with your parents? My daughter has to go to school and help around the house. That's our agreement. Do they expect you to work? My daughter wants to work and feels bad for it but at this time it's not feasible due to allot of circumstances, which is why she is focusing on school. I ask because I'm trying to figure out if your putting unnecessary stress on yourself. My daughter is this way she wants everything now ( job, car, etc.). I have to remind her everything comes in time and not to stress herself out about things that will come when the time is right. Focus on the positive and work towards goals.",

She said our niece(5 yr) was mad at her because she spanked her little brother(9 months) because he was wiggling when she was trying to change his diaper.  She was holding our 2 month old daughter when telling us this and she was crying. My partner said maybe she is crying because she\u2019s worried you\u2019ll spank her to which she replied \u201cmaybe I will\u201d I felt like my partner should have said something after she made that comment and he didn\u2019t. He claims she was only joking but I can\u2019t imagine anyone thinking that would be funny. IMO if you lose your temper about a baby wiggling and feel the need to spank them you certainly will not be watching my child no matter who you are.

Sorry but thats not normal, even for people who thinking spanking is ok.\n\nBased on her comment it feels like she was trying to assert that she has the right to hit anyone she wants to, no matter how young. Shes forgetting whose baby that is and that would make me not trust her judgment",

            "Never too early to set a boundary. Dont wait until it happens. I dont believe setting a boundary is overreacting. I know you said it was a joke, but I want to make sure were on the same page that we will not allow anyone to spank our children. How she reacts to that will let you know how to proceed.",
            "You are not overreacting. My father spanked me as a child. I hated it. I resented him and couldn't rationalize how he loved me but hit me. When he met my oldest for the first time he made a joke about spankings. It was a joke. No question. But it wasn't funny. I looked at him straight in the eye and said \"if you ever hit one of my children you'll never see us again\". And I was dead serious. That's a boundary with no wiggle room. If your husband can't handle that you need to have a fucking serious conversation about how much this matters to you. And it should matter. People who hit children are cowards with no mature parenting tools.",
            "Oh absofuckinlutely not. That is not acceptable. Spanking in general, but especially a BABY?! For *checks notes* being a baby?!!!! Nope. Thats a hard no. I would be having a serious conversation with not only your partner, but also the other childs parents. And MIL would certainly never be alone with my kids.",
