We typically reply with something that he refuses to eat because he\u2019s a very picky eater. \n2. Then he says \u201cI\u2019m hungry now\u201d (it may be an hour before dinner so I don\u2019t want to offer something that will fill him up). I reply with an offer of an apple or some other fruit. He says they\u2019re yucky. \n3. I remind him that we set the menu but he can choose what to eat. He sulks on the couch. \n\nThis is typically combined with a dialogue where he\u2019s bored and any activity suggestion I offer is rejected. \n\nWhat can I do to break this cycle of the \u201cno\u2019s\u201d? I feel like I\u2019m talking to a wall and my son stubbornly shows zero interest in working together.",

The punches are hard, like he's trying to hurt his dad, but the dad acts like he thinks the kid is playing. \n\nThis is a big kid. In a couple of years, he will start sprouting, and looking at his size right now, I would not be surprised if he ends up bigger and stronger than Dad. This is a disaster in the making. No one will talk to the dad as he's very sensitive about parenting, but there will be elder abuse coming in a few years (dad is an older parent). I am not close at all to this family member; we actually clash. So, do we just watch this all play out?"

Why you couldn't wait for your partner to be home, so they could stay with the baby?\n\nLike... yeah, okay, I'll be honest, the odds of something happening are slim. The chances of you getting into a car accident (or getting hit by a car), or someone breaking in while you're gone are unlikely. But for something that's not needed, that's not necessary, that can easily wait a few hours.... why would you run that risk? Especially given that newborns are *notorious* for waking up often, not sleeping soundly, etc. Like... even if you were only gone for fifteen minutes, imagine your baby waking up five minutes after you leave, and crying for ten minutes until you get back.\n\nAnd then ask yourself if the few hours -at most -to wait was worth it.",

Autistic men are particularly vulnerable to it. However much self control a regular man has, they have even less, through no fault of their own. Your son NEEDS therapy, and not just psychotherapy but also occupational therapy. You should probably install some sophisticated content-blocking and keystroke technology on his devices (and let him know about it). He literally can't stop this on his own.
