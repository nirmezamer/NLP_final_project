        "content": "# Welcome to PH Invest!\n\n**If you have no clue about investing and would like to learn:**\n\nPlease start by reading the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/phinvest/wiki/faq). It's written by awesome contributors of the sub. You can also try reading previous posts, particularly ones with the [\"Investment/Financial Advice\" flair](/r/phinvest/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Investment%2FFinancial%20Advice%22&restrict_sr=1). If you still want to ask questions, there's a sticky \"Random Discussion\" post and a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AxFw5Pb). If you prefer to create a new post, it helps to add details like your current financial situation, your time horizon, your goals, etc., as much details you're comfortable sharing.\n\n**If you're interested in funds and would like to compare their performance:**\n\nThis [webpage](https://r-phinvest.github.io/returns.html) shows the returns of mutual funds and unit investment trust funds on each year as well as compound annual returns. You can click on the fund names to go to their PIFA or UITF web pages. You can also graph their historical returns. Try playing with it by adding other funds, indexes and other data sets so you can visually compare them. The returns are also available in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12m0HBYB5dmVicUp9gHJ1tdSsMefaMYfWH2Mh1UIrAVc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**If you're interested in the financials of companies listed in The Philippine Stock Exchange:**\n\nI also maintain a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mj38XJrBChSAtK9vJNmrCjySV0EHbQClo-r6C8UQYfg/edit?usp=sharing) with quarterly and annual figures. I update all the data every weekend.\n\n**For other posters:**\n\nIf you're selling something, consider if it's more appropriate to post in a sub like r/phclassifieds. Here, at least create a substantial post about what you're selling that may spark a discussion. If it's just an ad, it'll be removed.\n\nPlease keep the posts relevant to investing in the Philippines or products and services readily available to Filipinos.\n\nThat's pretty much it. As long as Reddit's rules aren't violated, I'd rather not censor posts.\n\n# Good luck and happy investing!",

            "Just wanted to get your thoughts po. I don't know anyone well-versed sa ganito to consult them.\n\nBeen dying to own a house and lot. Almost 2 years ago ako nagstart magtingin online ng mga preselling and then even went site tripping.\n\nNow, almost a week ago, I paid a 5k downpayment for a house I really liked. Around 1.8M yung TCP nya. RFO na sya and reopen lang. Equity will be 11.8k for 10 months, then loanable sa PagIBIG yung 1.7M. Monthly amort will be 11.2k for 30 years.\n\nMy basic monthly income po is 40k. Side line can be the same amount monthly, if masipag\n\nI went into this prematurely. Nadala lang ng emosyon at naudyukan na rin ng nanay ko. \n\nMy worry is baka hindi maapprove ng yung buong 1.7M and then I have to shell out kung ano man yung kulang. I just depleted my savings due to an emergency so kung sakaling mangyari ito, ngayon ko pa lang tatrabahuhin ulit yung fund na yun.\n\nInassure ako ng developer na in case di maapprove yung buong amount, we can discuss the installment terms para dun sa remaining amount. I don't believe it one bit. Baka mahirapan lang ako when the time comes.\n\nJust for context din po, I absolutely have no need for this house for now. I live with my mom, I help pay the bills. NaFO-FOMO lang ako na I have to have some property under my name na pwede kong pagkakitaan sa buhay or tirhan later in life. I do want to live on my own eventually, pagawa ng sarili kong kitchen, sariling decor, yadda yadda.\n\nIdk. I'm just at a loss. Should I cut my losses and save up muna? Help an indecisive girl out \n\nThank you po.",

Hindi ko siya ginagamit so hindi ko naisip i-update phone number ko after ko magpalit ng SIM. But suddenly, naka-receive ako ng CC without applying for it. Ayaw ko na sana i-activate but realized it would be a good reference card if ever kukuha ako ng BPI Amore in the future (ito kasi talaga target ko). Kaso hindi ako maka-receive ng OTP since wala na sakin yung old SIM ko.\n\nTYIA!"

Maybe 5years max\n\nShould i take Rent to Own into consideration? Why?\n\nWhat are othet things that i need to know and take into consideration?\n\nIve read posts about basic DD that i need to do, who pays what, and would like to read more suggestions/ideas (pagibig vs bank loan etc)\n\nWould also like to know generally how much cash on-hand does one need to have in their accounts if they want to apply for loan?

            "I'vd bought a couple of properties and here are some tips lang.\n\n\nYou can usually loan up to 80% of the property valuation sa banks, so you just need to prepare at least 20% plus chattel, mortgage fees. \n\nYou can opt for shorter loan terms - 5 years, 10 years. I've always gone for 10 years FIXED RATE. \n\nIf hindi ka sa developer bibili ng house, there will be a lot of paperwork involved. Unlike pag lot lang madali. \n\nSince it looks like you got the cash naman, I would highly suggest buying a lot outright in cash tapos take out a construction loan instead using the lot as collateral. \n\nThat way you can build the house you want talaga, cheaper and better quality pa. \n\nAs always do your own due diligence when buying properties. Good luck!!",
            "Thankyou po for that suggestion, really gave me an idea of how to execute this.\n\nBuying lot in cash and then use it as collateral for bank loan to build a house sounds like the perfect idea here, do you have any idea po whats the diff or req for bank's home loan vs construction loan or they are the same?\n\nAlso usually when it comes to building our own house, if we are just aiming for standard house with quality, does it usually cost more than the lot it self? Lets say lot is 5M, will construction cost be more than this itself? Just approx lang po so i get an idea for this,but thankyou so much!",
            "Hello!\nFirst of all maraming salamat po for taking your time and write this down, this really helps and gives me alot of infos in general.\n\nFor now im thinking to buy a property for personal use as im getting older and having fomo and also parent keep saying i should reinvest some of my crypto/stock into 'real asset' as for them those are just digitals and super risky haha\n\nI still have some questions, so given my condition if lets say if i were to buy a lot that cost ~5M, how much cash do i need to prepare onhand (aside of 30% dp) to convince banks (i think bank loans are preferable here) because diba they will be doing bg check on me muna as in how much i have in bank, how much income per month etc etc.\n\nAgain,thankyou so much for helping :)",
            "Home loan (house and lot) usually hahanapin ng bank ang title, tax dec, building plans, building permit, occupancy permit etc. So they can assess the value of the property. \n\nIf construction loan naman, proof of ownership ng collateral, title, tax dec, properly drawn up construction plans, mga bill of materials, geodetic survey results etc.\n\nWhen applying for loans sa bank the collateral always needs to be under the name of the applicant, that's why masmadali na bilhin ang lot outright para under your name na agad. \n\nAs for cost, by sqm of the floor area usually ang estimate. A basic finish now may cost upwards of P20K-P25K per sqm na. So a house with a 100sqm floor area will be P2.5M at bare minimum for a basic finish siguro. \n\nSa construction loan, by % ang release ng funds kaya make sure your contractor is liquid enough to be able to construct the house using their own funds muna.",
            "Hi OP. I found your post very interesting. I hope this helps.Marami kasi talagang dapat i-consider aside from Budget. What I always confirm with my clients before investing are:\n\nNo. 1 - Ano ba ang Goal mo sa property? Investment ba or personal use? \n\nNo. 2 Browse ka ng gusto mong Property. Once may preferred ka na. You have to ask for the Total Contract Price (TCP) and year of turnover. \n\nNow, you may choose from pre-selling, RFO or rent to own? \n\n For Preselling. Depende sa developer.  Majority ng developer requires at least 20% - 30% Downpayment. This amount will be spread out to the number of months until turnover. \n\nFor example, TCP is 5M and turnover will be 3 years from now, then 20% of 5M is payable within 36 months. The remaining 80% will be payable either Cash, Bank Loan or Pag ibig before turnover on July 2027. \n\n For RFO - Cash agad yung 20% to move in. Then the remaining 80% will be either Cash, Bank Loan or Pag ibig. \n\n For Rent to own - You pay a unit for fixed monthly amount for 2 years as listed by the developer. \n\nFor example : Unit TCP is 5M\nMonthly Rent - 20,000\n1 Month Advance + 2 Month Deposit = 60,000\n2 Year Total Rent  = 480k (20k x 24months)\n\n6 month prior the end of contract mo, they will ask you if you intend the purchase the unit? If yes, only 60% of 480,000 will be deducted sa Total Contract Price. Then we can pay the remaining 4.5M to the developer either cash,bank loan or pag ibig.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of each payment options:\na.) CASH \nPros-  no long term obligation\nCons - Huge lumps\n\nb.) PAG-IBIG LOAN \nPros - No need to pay lumpsum,  flexible payment terms - up to 30 years. \nCons - Maraming requirements, Interest can go as 5.750% - 9.750% fixing period.\n \nYou can check this link below for further questions about pagibig loan. https://www.pagibigfund.gov.ph/FAQ_HL.html\n\nc.) BANK HOME LOAN \nPros - fewer requirements needed. \nCons - up to 20 years ang payment term.\nAs of today the rates starts at 5% - to 12% Annual interest depende sa term. \n\nLoan Interest depends on the bank basta aim for the lowest as possible. Please let me know if it helps somehow. "
