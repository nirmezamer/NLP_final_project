Whether it be colony planning, help with mods, or general guidance, post any questions you may have here! If you have an effort post about a game mechanic then this is also fine space for that but please consider making a separate subreddit post for maximum visibility.\n\nI am a bot, so I can't make jokes.

            "Why can't we queue psycast anymore? Maybe it's just me and mod conflicts but can anyone else queue psycast in 1.5? Or am I missing something?",
            "Rimworld of Magic question:   \n  \nSo I got a chronomancer because their reverse time spell seemed OP as heck.  But I casted reverse time four times on someone with a demolished shoulder and it didn't clear up the problem.  The shoulder had just be screwed up in a skirmish where I captured them.  Does it only work on colonists?  Did I wait too late to cast it on them?  Does it just not work like it is supposed to?\n\nTheir age went down by a year or so but their screwed up shoulder never got healed.",
            "so I'm a bit new, and is it supposed to take 6+ days of time just to do fabricator research? I even have two research benches and they're both in a clean room, it's just all these researches that take 4000+ points take ages no matter what. even got that thing you attach to the tables for faster speed.",
            "I've played off and on for years now, but since Anomaly have been playing nonstop with my first two ever successful colonies. I'm playing without mods and have all of the DLCs installed.   \nEarly on in my second colony tribal raiders kidnapped a child. When this happened I got a popup that said that there /will/ be chances to retrieve this child.   \nYears have passed and her parents and sister still have her on their social tabs. They all have feelings about her (she's apparently disfigured now, which I have no clue how any of them know that), but she has a +0 to feelings about all of them. When I hover over her name, it doesn't say she's dead- only that she belongs to the tribe type that stole her.   \nI have never gotten any opportunity that I have noticed to save her.  I've been raiding and destroying their nearby colonies nonstop in an effort to find her.  \nIs there something I'm missing here? Should I be trying to befriend this group of heathens instead of grinding them into the ground? Have I somehow just not hit the colony she's currently staying in?  \nAny help on how to find her would be appreciated. I've been putting off trying to get an endgame sequence until she is retrieved, as a bit of RP. But if there's no way to get her back, I'll just have to move on.",
            "I might be going crazy but I seem to remember that way back in the day, areas were different for humans and animals. Is there a mod that brings that back? Or introduces it if it was never like that and I'm just making it up. \n\nI've got about 6 areas for humans, 6 different areas for mechs and 4 different areas for animals and having all of them at the same time is a bit much, especially since I never want to put humans in animal areas and so forth.",
            "First time playing with Anomaly what tips would you give me with out to much spoiler?",
            "Are there any known mod conflicts that cause animal training to fail to complete? The pawn starts training, works for the usual amount of time, then instead of it saying it succeeded or failed... nothing happens. They just walk away and the animal is still free to be trained again.\n\n\nThere's nothing in the logs indicating an error. It's like it just skips the last step.",
            "Is anyone else unable to jump multiple pawns with jump packs?",
            "Is it just me, or can repeatedly reloading saves impact performance? After a few loads, my system freezes and I have to restart.\u00a0I\u2019m not sure if this is a mod issue, a Steam Deck issue, or just a Rimworld issue.",
            "Hi!\n\nI've all the things except for Biotech and Anomaly. I know a lot about Biotech from watching YT playthroughs, and I've been meaning to buy it for at least a year.\n\nDoes Anomaly require Biotech?\n\nI should probably just buy Biotech before I jump into Anomaly, right?\n\nIs it reasonable to expect a DLC bundle on steam? I don't remember, but I think I bought Ideology+Royalty as a bundle. I could wait months for a Biotech+Anomaly combo."
