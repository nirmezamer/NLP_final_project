        "content": "Flairing because I think this is one of those weird cases rule 3 goes over and I don't wanna get /killed by the mods.\n\nOk so. This is a wild story that I sorta made a comment on another post about, but as I thought about it, I realized holy hell this NEEDS to be a post because good god. I ended up talking about the whole saga on Discord with a few friends as it happened, so I have a (rough) outline of exactly how things went down.\n\nAnyway, I start out the game. Generic anomaly crash-land scenario on strive to survive difficulty, this is my first real playthrough with the new anomaly DLC and I wanted to have a good time. I don't play with many mods. I have the anthro race mod and a few quality-of-life and texture mods, but that's about it. Nothing more, because I want this first playthrough to be relatively vanilla.\n\nMy starting colonists are Keiko, Lloyd, and Albina. The first two of which are brother and sister. If you read the title, I'm sure you know where this is going. Not even 10 in-game hours after the initial crash-landing, the two got together. I still think that's the funniest thing. You crash land onto a hostile rimworld and you've gotta get yourself figured out and make camp so you survive the night, and your FIRST thought is \"Hmm ah yes I think I should ask my sister out by complimenting her leg hair.\"\n\n[My honest reaction when.](https://preview.redd.it/rulvruo7ke9d1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bff0c38c0c8958196b1d2b599b4d42c3d36fd2)\n\nNow, it could've stopped there. Things would be fine. But of course, it doesn't end there. The two end up getting married within a season, and within yet another, Keiko is pregnant. Since I wasn't too keen on the whole ordeal, I'd set the pregnancy approach to Avoid Pregnancy, but of course, if the two of them were apparently lovin' enough to get \"Got lovin' x8\" in their needs bar, of course that meant nothing.\n\nAnd of COURSE the game decided to throw yet another curveball at me, and decided that the pregnancy that I'd been avoiding would end up being twins. So here we are, Keiko and Lloyd with a set of twins, and I think I'd gotten a few other colonists through raids and such by then, but they aren't the focus of this post.\n\n[I didn't even know twins were possible. Mod thing maybe???? I don't think any of my mods did that tho.](https://preview.redd.it/me0a9ecjle9d1.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d694db8871fbe78575ced085a16a844c3a4472)\n\nAnyways. Story continues.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is the anomaly scenario and my main goal for this playthrough was to get the anomaly content. Keiko and Lloyd happen to be my lead researchers, and they've been in charge of all that. So a corrupted obelisk appears and me being completely unaware of the random chance to duplicate the person suppressing it, I simply let them research and suppress it like normal. This leads to what I can only describe as yet another step into the descent into insanity.\n\n[The clone wars.](https://preview.redd.it/mnlswxtnme9d1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f9b52fe8a0ca47c6eb99a220437ac41e20b2d6)\n\nDuring this whole time, Keiko and Lloyd are having more kids SOMEHOW and are up to like 5? The fifth of which has the inbred gene. I later looked it up and apparently the inbred gene is supposed to be 80% chance between siblings so the fact that we're up to now 5 kids and only one has had that gene is a bit insane if you ask me.\n\nKeiko ended up getting herself duplicated with the obelisk, and that clone was then dubbed Kaiko. By this point, I was fully embracing everything and was just curious to see how far things would go. The clones got together, which, honestly I don't think I was that surprised at this point because it seemed par for the course.\n\n[It continues.](https://preview.redd.it/53edod4lne9d1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=7228479486bd382dcb79fc8ecd50ebe58074bbca)\n\nNow of course it would be one thing if it was just this one pair of siblings. That would be crazy on its own. But no. We're going fully down the god damn Alabama pipeline.\n\nRemember those twins I mentioned earlier? Mhm. They're adults now. The colony is about 6-7 years old now  by this point. We've got a good number of colonists and the original Keiko and Lloyd have like 7 kids now while the clones have one of their own. Leif is one of the colony's main crafters, specializing in crafting and making armor and higher-tier guns. Lorena is the colony's main artist because our original artist got moved to construction. This is interesting because my artist bench and fabrication benches are right next to each other. Something I don't think I fully expected, but was unsurprised with nonetheless was the fact that Leif was getting \"rebuffed\" mood debuffs. Which. Goodness gracious I wonder where that's coming from. Eventually, it seems that Lorena got worn down though because welp apparently that's how things go in this colony from hell.\n\n[It CONTINUES.](https://preview.redd.it/ccf64vrwoe9d1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=7842be15fd261dc33fdb376599813e6307052515)\n\nThe clone situation as well. It certainly is going places. And by this point I'm just that idiot in the corner not asking should we do something but asking if we could. So uh. We now have 6 of them. 3 couples.\n\n[IT FUCKING CONTINUES](https://preview.redd.it/qtk1v8mipe9d1.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=2daac4b67cfef6359f14ee27b1cf01af0dcb0ca9)\n\nAs we near current day. I did some math and reflection.\n\n[Help.](https://preview.redd.it/gm16x52aqe9d1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf1d6dd35fad9c32735a99446b0e04258d038a1)\n\nSo anyway. That brings us basically to where we are now. 1 more set of duplicates of Lloyd and Keiko have been made, named Ddoyd and Kuiko, but otherwise, things are mostly caught up to where we are now. Obviously this colony has had a whole lot of other things over time, other colonists I haven't mentioned, other events and big deals like deaths and other kids, but this post is about how my colony has become fucking Alabama so here we are. I'm still playing this colony so it's just an ongoing thing, but good god this is one of the fucking playthroughs ever.\n\n[The full colony.](https://preview.redd.it/191bvj3kre9d1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=519db09a785bf872b9e75a4263df26a44a4153c3)\n\n[Keiko's relationship tab.](https://preview.redd.it/q0lc80u4se9d1.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=a749f7a750cd0806b19d125ae7db3abd1eafa40f)\n\n[Leif's relationship tab.](https://preview.redd.it/cz83suj7se9d1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ae1995e12dfacb4e7ba3a0ad40fdde6ccff46b6)\n\n[I didn't even know the \\\\\"Got some lovin'\\\\\" buff could get this high.](https://preview.redd.it/5akanx8rse9d1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde15165e40fb57d9b3ebc265bd2a95e55745754)\n\nTheir relationship bars are always maxed out. They seem relatively happy. But good god. Their family tree is just a god damn straight line. And I'm not convinced the \"Pregnancy Approach\" option does \\*anything\\*.\n\nAny questions people have I will do my best to answer. And once again, I've looked through my mod list, and read the whole of the anthro mod's XML to see if it's just something where pawns of the anthro race don't care about siblings or something, and nope, turns out the game just decided fuck you Alamaba time.",
