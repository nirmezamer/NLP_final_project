            "It's interesting to see that they're making two shows for younger audiences, I hope the movie is more as adult aimed like Fionna and Cake!",
            "Brief Synopsis from [someone who was actually at the event](https://x.com/MidouMir/status/1800899051459608617):\n> Adventure Time Movie: they set out to find a birthday gift for PB but their adventure will lead them to world changing stuff.",
            "It\u2019s crazy it took them this long for Adventure Time to get a Movie\u00a0",
            "Well, we know how it all ends. Finn & Jake die and get reincarnated.\n\nAnd Simon gets his happy-ish ending.\n\nHere's hopin the new stuff doesn't retcon anything.\n\nBut i am optimistic.",
            "AT movie:\n\nThe AT movie is the one I am most excited for. Glad to see Adam, Rebecca, and Pat all attached. \n\nI'm sure we'll be getting Rebecca Sugar songs.\n\nTwo plot synopses have been released:\n\nhttps://www.animationmagazine.net/2024/06/wb-cartoon-network-hanna-barbera-announce-adventure-time-spin-offs-more-new-shows-at-annecy/\n\nhttps://x.com/midoumir/status/1800899051459608617?s=46\n\nHappy to see PB finally getting a major role and more Finn and PB interaction.\n\nA big Finn and Jake adventure, should be awesome.\n\nMinerva and the humans have to play a role.\n\nIf Flame Princess is gonna appear it'd have to be here. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE\n\nI want lots of cameos and fan service\n\nI'm guessing it will take place about two years after CAWM.\n\nCould we see Jake's death??\n\nHopefully/probably will be TV-14\n\nAdventure Time Side Quests:\n\nThis is the only one that Muto isn't confirmed to be attached to. That makes me really worried.\n\nThis also worries me: https://x.com/midoumir/status/1800945269242015962?s=46\n\nPlease don't be a reboot\n\nA prequel that shows Finn and Jake's childhood, J and M's deaths, them meeting Ice King and PB, etc would be great\n\nI wonder if they will use Finn and Jake's designs from Distant Lands BMO\n\nI hope this is before the og show and not like lost episodes from the first two seasons\n\nClassic Ice King confirmed! I miss him\n\nAt least Nate Cash is involved I guess\n\nThis will probably be 11 minute episodes which will be cool to get again. I'm also assuming the same age rating as the og series. They are really trying to reach every demo\n\nMarceline can't really be in this if its a prequel unless its noncanon or she doesn't interact with Finn and Jake\n\nAre they gonna have to recast young Finn? I assume they'll just get Jeremy to do his best like with Together Again's dream\n\nIt being a prequel might mean they are trying to fit it into the timeline and not reboot\n\nUpdate: looks like it is canon https://x.com/midoumir/status/1800955391356158381?s=46\n\nUpdate: https://x.com/midoumir/status/1800964557441048967?s=46\n\nSet during season 1 and 2\n\nAdventure Time Heyo BMO:\n\nThe art style is cute. I don't really mind. Its just a cute fun side thing.\n\nSHELBY IS FINALLY BACK. Which means Pen Ward back as a VA\n\nWhere is NEPTR?? Especially with Shelby here\n\nI'm guessing this takes place after CAWM with BMO moving out \n\nI'm sure Football will show up\n\nI'd like to see Y5 and Moe lore but I probably shouldn't expect a ton from a preschool show.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if these are 7 minute episodes.\n\nI'm worried about BMO not having his edge in a preschool show.\n\nVery glad Muto is attached. Also Ashlyn Antsee, returning storyboard artist\n\nLooks like BMO erased his memory again like in Be More. Could be why he doesn't remember Finn's name (probably not)???\n\nI'm guessing Finn and Jake will cameo\n\nThis person worked on concept art:\nhttps://x.com/crisppyboat/status/1800906747609288849?s=46\n\nTwo plot synopses for it:\nWB, Cartoon Network & Hanna-Barbera Announce 'Adventure Time' Spin-Offs & More New Shows at Annecy | Animation Magazine\n\nhttps://x.com/midoumir/status/1800898733363875927?s=46\n\nI really hope Muto isn't stretched too thin here.\n\nWe are literally a cinematic expanded universe now.\n\nUpdate: https://www.tumblr.com/aracle/753110990252589056/how-long-did-you-know-about-all-these-at-projects\n\nLooks like they were probably greenlit at the same time as F and C season 2\n\nIn other news: Regular Show is coming back with a new series!\n\nAT, Gumball, and Regular Show all in production right now!\n\n\nu/Carrehz",
            "Wow\u2026um\u2026this sounds like a LOT.\n\nI\u2019m a bit worried that the soul of this franchise might be taken away sooner than we expect, but at the same time it\u2019s also all very intriguing. So I\u2019ll just go into everything with an open mind",
            "My headcanon is going to be that Heyo BMO is going to be from the perspective of BMO from the Extinct World after everyone died",
            "More AT is obviously a Win, but I would hate to see this turn into another situation where the artists are overstretched and forced to meet deadlines cause of these braindead CEO's. Considering this is WB we're talking about, extreme caution is adviced\n\nBut I also see no problem with these shows being not too great, since they're not really targeted towards us. And if they will be just in-betweens and source of funds to make the big bois like F&C",
            "I'm so excited for SideQuests, because I feel like Fionna&Cake was not 100% in the spirit of Adventure Time",
            "ya this not fun news for me. im excited about the movie but the rest is uhhh very concerining. i guess theyre gonna teen titans go this :/"
