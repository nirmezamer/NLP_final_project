Considering this is WB we're talking about, extreme caution is adviced\n\nBut I also see no problem with these shows being not too great, since they're not really targeted towards us. And if they will be just in-betweens and source of funds to make the big bois like F&C",
            "I'm so excited for SideQuests, because I feel like Fionna&Cake was not 100% in the spirit of Adventure Time",
            "ya this not fun news for me. im excited about the movie but the rest is uhhh very concerining. i guess theyre gonna teen titans go this :/",

Like how Craig McCracken has said he is developing a PPG revival but its not been officially greenlit yet. I don't think they would specify which projects have been greenlit if all of them have already been greenlit.",
