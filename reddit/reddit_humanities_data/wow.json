RwlRwlRwlRwl!*       \n\nThat's murloc for \"Welcome to Murloc Mondays\" - where people can ask any type of question about WoW without getting strangled by a Death Knight.       \n\nQuestions can range from what's new in Dragonflight, what class is OP, and how many Demons will it take to down Thrall?       \n\nQuestions can come from brand new players, players returning, or veteran players who never got a chance to ask the right question.     \n\nAfraid of not getting an answer? Rest assured, we know that at least 90% [of questions get answered!](https://redd.it/djsvm8)      \n\nYou may want to look at /r/wownoob as well!      \n\n***      \n\nHere are some handy guides to [start World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://www.wowhead.com/new-players-world-of-warcraft) or [start Classic World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23090134).      \n\nUnless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).",

            "I last played Wow back in Legion, and yesterday I got back to it.\n\nIs there any cool/important stuff from BFA or Shadowlands that I should look into going \"back\" to collect, or stuff that could make my life easier in Dragonflight?",

            "I started leveling an alt to test a new class to decide on my main for TWW, and it looked like MOP remix perfect for that.  After a few level with my alt, I read that you both can't pvp when doing mop (BGs), and can't leave remix at all until it ends. It might even not end before the prepatch? Is that still true or did blizz patch it?\n\nI'm wondering if i should delete my char and start on regular wow. I mostly do pvp in end game, and I need to try it with my new class before the beginning of TWW.",

            "Hi, I primarily play tank and heal so I don't have much experience with DPS. I'm wondering if there are any specs that are similarish to Demonology Warlock?\n\nI don't mean in the sense of pet focused, but more like the feeling that you get when you do a ton of damage with the press of one button (implosion in this case). I don't have the time to try out every dps spec to see if they have a one button big damage ability :)",
            "What addon shows the gems and enchants next to the appropriate gear slot in the character pane?\n\nI have both ElvUI and DejaCharacterStats, but this info display suddenly stopped appearing on some of my characters and I can't find where to reenable it :/"

            "Looking forward to it!",
            "**[Donate](https://give.thetrevorproject.org/team/588240)**\n\n**[Troll Run Info Page](https://runningofthetrolls.carrd.co/)**\n\n**[Discord & Other Socials?](https://runningofthetrolls.carrd.co/#socials)**\n\n# **What is the Trevor Project?**\n\nThe Trevor Project is a non profit focused on sucidide prevention for LGBTQA+ youth. In the simplest of terms, we believe that the youngest members of our community deserve a chance to start and truly enjoy all life has to offer.   \n\n# **When:** \n\nSaturday, June 29th, 2024 on Feathermoon-US\n\nThe run leaves the starting zone at 6pm Pacific Time/9pm Eastern Time/1am GMT.\n\n*We strongly suggest showing up earlier as there\u2019s always a bit of a beach party going on for guild invites. There will be people gathering that evening/early afternoon. We will provide notice of when we are online on social media/discord.*\n\n#**Where:**\n\nThe Running of the Trolls is held exclusively on Feathermoon-US in the Troll starting zone, right where you log in on a fresh troll on the Echo Isles.\n\nWe\u2019ll be swimming, running, and taking a zeppelin on the way to Silvermoon!\n\nPlease note: If you are on a trial account or otherwise don\u2019t have Exile\u2019s Reach finished, new characters will need to make their way to the Troll starting zone on the Echo Isles. Please keep this in mind when deciding when to make your characters!\nAdditional Note Higher level characters may be phased into \u2018present day\u2019 Tirisfal Glades. You can find Zidormi @69.4,62.8 to send you to the \u2018past\u2019 version of Tirisfal where lower level runners will be once they run out of Undercity!\n\n# **How to Join:**\n\nSimply log in on June 29th before run start time and join us! You can just roll a level 1 Troll, and we\u2019ll have invites to our 3 guilds, no need to do anything else!\n\nIf you need to make your way to us on the beach we'll be waiting for you!\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot facilitate Cross Realm invites for anyone at all. Cross Realm characters are unable to join our guilds and some of the chat channels, and we don't have the time to coordinate everyone wanting to bring their own characters via anchoring them to the realm by players on Feathermoon. Also, we worry that the lower level players could wind up phased into the wrong realm and not have as much fun.\n\nWe also cannot provide transportation or summons to the beach as the race crew will primarily be on low level characters!\n\nIt's really best to roll a new character on Feathermoon or its sister realm Scarlet Crusade and you don't have to stress about missing out on being able to say hello to everyone!\n\n# **What Hair Color Should I Pick?:**\n\nUnlike our Gnome runs, we feel that you should have a say in what hair color you decide to give to your Troll!\nPlease pick whatever color makes you most happy! Pick something from the Pride flag that means something to you, pick a color you love, pick a color that makes your Troll look great! In the end, we\u2019ll wind up with a rainbow!\n\n# **Can I be a Zandalari instead?**\n\nTroll is a Troll and all Trolls are welcome!\nDo remember that you will have to make your way to the starting point, but as long as you're respectful and kind the same as all other players, we want you here!\n\n# **What about [Lists other races here]?**\n\nWe can't stop you really, but the fun of the event is doing something together from all over in a unifying sense with a lot of other people rather than being \"that one person\".\n\n\n# **Guilds:**\n\nRace Guilds are our substitute for Raids, since low levels can\u2019t form raid groups- also, forming hundreds of players into raid groups is a headache no one on Earth wants, and someone is pretty likely to get left out.\nThe guilds exist year round, but are mostly unmanned; you\u2019re welcome to stay or to come back each year!\n\nWe ask that, even while it's hectic or there are multiple guilds, you try to join guilds that we've confirmed, for a few reasons.\nSome people donate based upon how many people show up and it's easier to guesstimate a number by looking at numbers online though some of our tools have gotten a bit wonky over the years for counting. Also, in the past, people have tried to share fake donation links or fake information.\n\nPlease understand that there\u2019s only a few of us and a lot of you! If we aren\u2019t inviting for a certain guild at any particular moment, please don\u2019t get your heart set on a certain guild name, or ask us to move you all around.\nPLEASE NOTE: Trial accounts cannot be invited to guilds!\n\nRace Guilds are our substitute for Raids, since low levels can\u2019t form raid groups- also, forming hundreds of players into raid groups is a headache no one on Earth wants, and someone is pretty likely to get left out.\nThe guilds exist year round, but are mostly unmanned; you\u2019re welcome to stay or to come back each year!\n\nWe ask that, even while it's hectic or there are multiple guilds, you try to join guilds that we've confirmed, for a few reasons.\nSome people donate based upon how many people show up and it's easier to guesstimate a number by looking at numbers online though some of our tools have gotten a bit wonky over the years for counting.

Asking to get friends invited to chat is more likely to get overlooked than a whisper directly from someone to one of us, we hate making you feel overlooked!***\n\n# **Guild names:**\n\n - Running of the Trolls\n - Troll for Initiative\n - Trollkyo Drift\n\nWe will be adding an additional guild and will update the name on all platforms and this website before the run!\n\n# **Tabards**\n\nSince we're making a rainbow with our hair, the tabards are as close to the Trans Pride flags as we can get, and we've had them that way since creation of the event in honor of Leelah Alcorn.\n\nAs a reminder, because of changes to how tabards work in Retail from Legion's pre-patch going forward, we can't trade you a tabard because they're now Bind on Pickup. You can, however, mail yourself a tabard from the guild vendor from your main! There's a mailbox right in the starting area that's super easy to get to.\n\n# **Are Toys, Mounts and Other Items Allowed?**\n\nWe try to limit some of the more spammy items like the ones that change the surface area to all fel and so on, but we think it's really fun to use the rainbow and disco toys!.\nIf you are with the pack it's more fun to run on foot but it's totally understandable to want to use a mount to check for stragglers or to catch up.\nUse your best judgment, keep the environment fun for everyone, and remember that everyone's idea of fun is different!\n\n\n# **Classic Version?**\n\nI currently don't have any plans to host this. I will update if there is one in the future.\n\n# **After Party?**\n\nIt is more challenging than the Gnome Run, but some people like to go kiss as many Alliance Leaders as possible between Silvermoon and the Stormwind Throne!\n\n\n# **Can I Stream/Post Videos/Share Other Content of the Run?**\n\nPlease share the run with your audience in whatever way you'd like! We love sharing your stuff!\nWe just have to ask: if you want to stream or make a video, we just ask that you share a link to the fundraising page, and make clear where personal/fundraiser donations are going and that you behave with respect to participants.\n\n# **Hashtag?**\n\nTrollRun2024\n\n**[Merch](https://warcraft-cares-shop.fourthwall.com/collections/running-of-the-trolls?)**"

So meanwhile testing around I found some amazing keybinds, that I want to share with you:\n\n**Shift+Left Mouseclick**: Game changer, it's direct in front of your eyes but no one comes up with it instead of side buttons or any normal keys. Its perfectly for mouseover spells, like the range spell for melees, it gives you a little feeling of shooter games that lets you also shoot with left mouseclick.\n\n**Shift+Space**: I had alot of problems to bind some spells like backjumps, so i mostly never played it until I tested Shift+Space. It's so perfect for that kind of spell, because the brain is already trained that your jump is always space. Also similiar spell fits also perfectly like walk over water or slow fall spells.\n\n**\\^**: It's direct near the key 1 and can be perfect used for ultimate spells or start spells, like The Hunt (DH), Charge (Warrior) or Wake of Ashes (Paladin) thats near your rotation spells that arent so much used, but still often used.\n\nOf course theese keybinds can be used for any spells you prefer.\n\nDo you have such secret keybinds where you think that they are amazing?
