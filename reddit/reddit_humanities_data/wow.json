Rest assured, we know that at least 90% [of questions get answered!](https://redd.it/djsvm8)      \n\nYou may want to look at /r/wownoob as well!      \n\n***      \n\nHere are some handy guides to [start World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://www.wowhead.com/new-players-world-of-warcraft) or [start Classic World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23090134).      \n\nUnless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed.

            "Possibly a dumb/silly question - seeing how many bajillion raid advertisements (Fyrakk kills, weekly awakened heroic raids, etc) there are in chat now, I wonder - what do these groups do with the gold?  The way their squawking in the chat channels is written it sure looks like some of them are essentially professional raid sellers, they tout that they run every x minutes and some even use like a brand name like \"ZakRaider\" and whatnot.  \n\nWhat in the world can they be using all of this money for?  Is there something not as illicit they can be doing or is it illicit somehow?  It feels like there's no way they're just turning around and throwing that gold for sale on a website or something since it would be pretty easy to tell that someone who just received large sums of gold is now handing them out to x other parties who are then presumably trading to even more other parties?\n\nMaybe I'm off my rocker here, but it's just startling to me how much it seems like raid clears are selling and for the amount of gold they're going for it has to be a ton, even split among a group of carriers.  Just hard to see how it could be anything but essentially a business for real money with how much they seem to be operating.",
            "remix question:\n\nso I have a +200k thread 476 ilvl dude already, but I want to try another alt at OP levels of ilvl/threads. I did the mailbox exp thing and got a brewmaster to 70 and with the bronze I got from 70 I upgraded everything to 360. \n\nis there any way to ease into raids and content without being severely underpowered and getting 1 shot by mobs, especially as a tank? I imagine it'd be doing the dailies + world bosses + try to get into normal raids, but as a low ilvl tank I assume it'd be hard for me to tank anything until I am a bit more overpowered? \n\nany suggestions?",

Would love to have them but I can't get myself to farm a 100 boxes a day for world drops and do all of the raids (not to mention getting a character(s) to the ilvl needed for the raids. \n\nArsenals would be a major help.",
            "Personally I plan on getting the mounts I'm missing and maybe a few more of the tmogs, currently I'm looking my 476 on daily, collecting the bronze caches and banking them in case they buff it again, I figure when I fill the bank I'll open everything buy as much as I can and call it a day.\n\nThe game mode is fun, I had a great deal of fun in the first few weeks, but currently it's getting a bit samey, so I'm playing a bit of D4.\n\nSo yeah it would be nice to have weapon collections, it's not something I'm going to overly stress over.",
            "I'd prefer they either tie the weapon transmogs to quests or end-of-quest chain rewards, or, alternatively, bump up the drop chance.\n\nWith the quest route, you keep players running around Pandaria, and automatically unlock the other rewards regardless of what you pick.\n\nDungeons and raids are fine, but I'd rather have a reason to visit the zones more.  1.6 million bronze is a fair expectation for someone to collect to grab what's already available.  No need to hike than number up further for weapons.\n\nRegardless, if I don't manage to unlock everything, I'll be okay. Between mounts, ensembles and everything else, Blizzard has been more than generous with this content.  I'm not going to complain.",

            "No, it was probably more along the line of him not being able to keep up and feeling like he didn't contribute to anything which is actually a thing.\n\nAnd as others have said, if someone rushes the bosses and kills them before the rest of the group gets up to the fight, they lose out on exp and/or loot.",
            "A lot of people are talking about credit and loot but also just... like, yes, some people want to actually be able to play the game. And the state of Remix right now is that only one person per instance actually gets to play (and even then \"press a button to destroy everything\" isn't much in the way of playing), and it's frustrating for a lot of people.\n\nIt's the reason I'm puttering around in Season 4 instead of playing Remix right now myself. I have all the cosmetic stuff I want, and I have no interest in spending my time trying to keep up with someone else as they run through a dungeon instagibbing everything in sight just so I can make some numbers high enough that I can then make four other people try to keep up with me as I run through a dungeon instagibbing everything in sight.\n\nIf you like that kind of thing, that's great, I'm genuinely glad that this experience is available to you.  \nIt's just not for me.",
            "Some people have wrong expectations from this event, there was someone here demanding other people go slow because they wanted to \"learn their rotation\".\n\nBUT there is an objective problem in some instances, if the group is too far behind, they don't get credit for boss kills, so locked out of loot and no mail either, that's very rude on the part of those rushing.\n\nWhich case it is for you, only you know.",
            "I\u2019m just happy when my Nth alt gets someone who obliterates dungeons.\n\nWe\u2019re here for the dailies, everything else is secondary.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a number of people learning their rotations while levelling in TWW. And that\u2019s just fine.",
            "Others have answered.\n\n\nBut it's really:\n1) you actually have some bad dungeons where folks don't get credit\u00a0\n2) you lose access to loot in some of them, though some of the boss loot is sent in mail (from what I've seen, not all of it is).\n3) feel and experience.\u00a0 This is just all feels, so matters less than the technical aspects above which actually affect someone's time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs much as going slower may be considered a waste of your time, going so fast that one locks people out of the content is a waste of theirs.\u00a0 For people who are aware of this, there's probably a middle ground which adds like 1 min to the overall run but doesn't have the negative options for anyone.\n\n\nAlso, the penalty system for dropping from an lfg locks you out for like 30 mins, which is pretty ridiculous in MoP:Remix specifically.\u00a0 So, folks who don't like the pace can't even drop to find one they like.",
            "i mean for the people who just want to level up quickly, get their bronze and toys/mounts, then it's great to have a \"booster\". for the people who actually want to play the game then it gets really boring to just run after someone and collect mediocre loot.\n\nit's not the fault of the high geared player though but rather blizzard's, in my opinion the balance should've been more like season of discovery's, you get new cool abilities but the enemies are also buffed up so it's an even match.",
            "Only time I have a problem with this, are the ones with a big \"I'm a god\" ego. Rushes the boss locking the rest of us out making the boss take longer than it should, because he isn't as powerful as he thinks."
