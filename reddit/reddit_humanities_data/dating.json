        "content": "There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.\n\nOur \"No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda\" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, \"alpha-male\" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** \n\nThis means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term \"Chad\" is unwanted and will be removed.\n\nWe can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. \n\nAt the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.\n\n**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",

        "content": "I recently attended a reunion where the conversation turned to sex and body counts, (which I was so interested about as I'm a virgin and is always being teased by my bff because of it) and I was surprised to find that most of the guys present preferred women with experience. Their reasoning was that experienced women know how to please their partners, whereas virgins require guidance, which can be tiresome. This made me wonder if being a virgin is seen as a drawback. Having saved myself for the right person, it's disheartening to hear that experience might be more valuable to men than emotional connection or other qualities. Is this really what matters most to them?",

            "its definitely the opposite. i lost my virginity when i was 23 because of personal beliefs and from 15-23 i was HOUNDED for that vcard. and i was almost raped a couple times as well for it. my frenemies would always tell guys, and guys would see it as some kind of challenge. it was super exhausting, and they just love the idea of innocent/purity. it's so icky",

            "I prefer women who allow me to be myself, it has nothing to do with sexual experience. Don't really care what your experience is. It's how do you care about my soul",
            "Emotional connection and experience are not mutually exclusive.  You can have both.",
            "The real underlying appeal I would argue is enthusiasm. Women who have had many partners know what they like, and therefore it's more likely the sex is good when you both see that your wants are compatible. But there's many 'inexperienced' people who still learn what they like pretty quickly and are just as enthusiastic as anyone, and they're awesome.\n\nI do think this makes sex with a virgin a bit against the current because you still have to learn about what you like, let alone what your partner does, but there's no guarantee that an experienced lover will be a good one, I've had many starfish lovers that prided themselves on their past experiences, and a common thread there was lack of communication on their part, which is one thing that I would expect you to be stronger than most at the beginning if you are saving yourself for 'the one' and you meet someone that clearly you both love each other enough to finally want to have sex with them.",
            "obligatory people arent a monolith statement.\n\nI personally would prefer to do something with someone who knows how to do it/ what they want.  Dead awkward starfish sex is cool and all but its not my thing.  There are some men who will value this but the overwhelming amount of people who have had sex will prefer someone who knows how to have sex.",
            "I get why that conversation bummed you out. Just because those guys prefer experienced women doesn\u2019t mean everyone does. Your choice to save yourself for the right person is personal and special. The right partner will value that and appreciate you for who you are. Don't let one conversation make you doubt your worth. Stay true to yourself, and the right person will come along!"
