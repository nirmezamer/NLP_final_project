        "content": "Ok, this is the community follow up to this post where I asked skilled players what the best and favorite ships for each resource were. I will post the charts next to each other for your comparison. The community responses are in Blue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Strongest Steel ships for competitive play.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it9o3hvn4l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=421ac71e7bac769d130a0f23de5b712333918815\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3oxopnbd4l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=433aebc01657277fcf069a3ac031c6e711bac910\n\nNot a whole big difference, Skilled players seem to like Incomparable better which is definitely a glass cannon of sorts and the community as a whole liked Mecklenberg better than skilled players liked it, lots of guns seems to be key there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the most fun steel ships to play?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uqv54lc5l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f7d7881898125b66588dc1142202e2685f49a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xvj7fab5l4d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c329342d32603448e0f821b3fb088056140fbbe\n\nNot a lot of appreciable differences. Again the community as a whole seems to Like 16 guns on the Meklenberg better than skilled players. Stalingrad falls a few places on the community list. That one is baffling as most everyone talks about how OP it is and how good the guns are on it. I'm guessing that perhaps it may be a difficult ship to not get burned down in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite steel ship?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/havp5etq6l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=8903425935d0a0642795b7eda50db06036ab8087\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5fffdlv6l4d1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6f43cdaded3669d6ecd68968be3f249c9a97c7\n\nCommunity likes the dakka dakka of Austin but not of Ragnar. Also this list has me hopeful for the community as only 2 people listed Shikishima as their favorite so there might not be as many weebs in this community as I thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the best coal ships for competitive play?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qapyqd308l4d1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e29eb6e7aae4526e21a2d87157728b06ac18b1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyq4j6i18l4d1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a9a43ef039cee9910c7ea818cd6545fe3fd733\n\nThe top end is nearly identical. Community did not like Neustra as much though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the most fun coal ships?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ignore description](https://preview.redd.it/srd9f2ok8l4d1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=517c403a165122e1308d114d53da8b35cc24fa6a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqfxmwnl8l4d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e8a97ae21fda2d62300af4e03ecc86aa7ed67f\n\nDefinitely a few changes, but not much at the top end. Salem more liked by Skilled players for sure, Groningen by the community as a whole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite T10 coal ship?**\n\n[Ignore the description](https://preview.redd.it/gf0ea90i9l4d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=430a942a87514a946d3e3513396ea32deaae404b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1dq7ycj9l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c2a739e9b24085e4446477bd8440cde14af43d\n\nTop 3 are the same, various changes amongst the lower end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite T9 coal ship?**\n\n[Ignore the description on the bottom, forgot to edit it.](https://preview.redd.it/wj6k3201al4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdbf76de0cd9bf01ea748105f0f57120fb7c49a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldt6tx32al4d1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=387ddf8bb7663f19ab97ffb681c11e24917050ab\n\nAgain, skilled players put more stock in the Neustra than the community as a whole. And the community really likes their secondaries and airplanes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the best RB ships for competitive play?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rn3a5zt2bl4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c23a4ba914622f7afd6b5a8db852473ed961bc6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmmj9uw3bl4d1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=309e75e4420591e96d4cfeb15fb12e3d037f4bec\n\nNot a whole lot of difference between the 2, Scilia falls a bit on the community list and that's about the only major differnce\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the most fun RB ships?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v198r5fmbl4d1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e9713459dfec87b1fb025b5f11728948b357a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waaa9fkobl4d1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=b546ba08596aefb5f1ba8cf60994601f7cb12bb5\n\nNearly identical, most ships within 2 places of each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Favorite RB Ship?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05tf91mzbl4d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=8991aafd1dbbbac90b2c7963d8941290a438380b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwp6drr0cl4d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d63a565bfee38cece472f1dbffeeb4530c10f37\n\nA little more emphasis from skilled players on their favorite ships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now for the Q&A\n\n>!Q: Why does it say favorite steel ship on some of the graphs that aren't for favorite steel ship?!<\n\n>!A: Too lazy to edit my graph in sheets and honestly too lazy to notice.!<\n\n>!Q: You still have Mecklenberg misspelled. It has a 'u' in it.!<\n\n>!A: That's not a question but yes, I left that there just for you.!<\n\n>!Q: Why is the order of the graphs for steel ships reversed?!<\n\n>!A: To see if anyone would notice.!<\n\n>!Q: Surely after this poll you aren't still cynical about the player base are you?!<\n\n>!A: I counted no less than 20 posts made to this subreddit about what resource ship someone should buy in the 21 days after the previous post was made and stickied. And that was 2 quick searches, there are likely more posts that were not gleaned in those simple searches!<\n\n>!Q: So this didn't stop the deluge of vague posts from clueless players asking strangers on the internet what they should do with their hard earned currencies?!<\n\n>!A: Nope!<\n\n>!Q: Then why did you do this?!<\n\n>!A: Not sure, probably some hidden trauma from my childhood manifesting itself. Either that or I've gone insane playing against subs and CV's!<",

            "I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that you should get the ship you want/like. I picked the z42 over the Ragnar. Is Ragnar busted as hell? Yeah. But I don\u2019t like the play style. This is a video game. It should be FUN. There\u2019s no point in getting a ship that\u2019s meta but you don\u2019t like the play style. Have fun.",

This community never fails",

            "This post hasn't 'solved the problem' but it's great work, and the larger part of the 'problem' with the too many too vague threads about what X to by next is that it can be difficult for a n00b to find out what the general community consensus is.\n\nThat guy who must exist can love Marco Polo all he wants, but most of us think it sucks, and that's what you want to know before you buy it most of the time.\n\nThis post lets me tell someone \"here's what most people think\" with a link if I want. \n\nAlso it's sometimes very difficult for good, players to figure out what sort of ships are good for bad players to choose, and this is a nice way to quantify that to whatever extent it can be.\n\nTL:DR(That's not a knock on the good players, bad players don't know why they are bad and probably can't explain it. I'm bad because I'm stupid, don't pay attention and used to drink a lot. I have excellent vidja game skills though despite my age, so Champagne is good for me, even though it's \"hard to play\" in the sense you better know how to aim, drive. But you can switch flanks twice and kite away and push in and then go run down a DD at the end of the game, so things like initial positioning aren't all that important.)"

            "Jacksonville's heal buff makes it identical to the ones found on ships like Austin, if it's not crippled or dev struck with citadels it'll be quite the cockroach.\n\nThe buffs to range and ballistics are questionable at best though, the ship should have the floaty arcs of all other American light cruisers. Austin and Vallejo get better arcs but their damage output is much worse (sure Austin gets the highest DPM in the game on demand but that's tied to brief bursts with MBRB).",
