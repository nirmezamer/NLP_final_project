I will post the charts next to each other for your comparison. The community responses are in Blue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Strongest Steel ships for competitive play.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it9o3hvn4l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=421ac71e7bac769d130a0f23de5b712333918815\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3oxopnbd4l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=433aebc01657277fcf069a3ac031c6e711bac910\n\nNot a whole big difference, Skilled players seem to like Incomparable better which is definitely a glass cannon of sorts and the community as a whole liked Mecklenberg better than skilled players liked it, lots of guns seems to be key there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the most fun steel ships to play?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uqv54lc5l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f7d7881898125b66588dc1142202e2685f49a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xvj7fab5l4d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c329342d32603448e0f821b3fb088056140fbbe\n\nNot a lot of appreciable differences. Again the community as a whole seems to Like 16 guns on the Meklenberg better than skilled players. Stalingrad falls a few places on the community list. That one is baffling as most everyone talks about how OP it is and how good the guns are on it. I'm guessing that perhaps it may be a difficult ship to not get burned down in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite steel ship?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/havp5etq6l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=8903425935d0a0642795b7eda50db06036ab8087\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5fffdlv6l4d1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6f43cdaded3669d6ecd68968be3f249c9a97c7\n\nCommunity likes the dakka dakka of Austin but not of Ragnar. Also this list has me hopeful for the community as only 2 people listed Shikishima as their favorite so there might not be as many weebs in this community as I thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the best coal ships for competitive play?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qapyqd308l4d1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e29eb6e7aae4526e21a2d87157728b06ac18b1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyq4j6i18l4d1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a9a43ef039cee9910c7ea818cd6545fe3fd733\n\nThe top end is nearly identical.

Salem more liked by Skilled players for sure, Groningen by the community as a whole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite T10 coal ship?**\n\n[Ignore the description](https://preview.redd.it/gf0ea90i9l4d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=430a942a87514a946d3e3513396ea32deaae404b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1dq7ycj9l4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c2a739e9b24085e4446477bd8440cde14af43d\n\nTop 3 are the same, various changes amongst the lower end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your favorite T9 coal ship?**\n\n[Ignore the description on the bottom, forgot to edit it.](https://preview.redd.it/wj6k3201al4d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdbf76de0cd9bf01ea748105f0f57120fb7c49a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldt6tx32al4d1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=387ddf8bb7663f19ab97ffb681c11e24917050ab\n\nAgain, skilled players put more stock in the Neustra than the community as a whole.

        "content": ">!this is not a real devblog, I'm just primarily having fun with numbers and parodying the actual devblogs !<\n\nIn Update \ud835\udfcf\u01b7.7 two new ships will be added to the game for testing, German Cruisers Donar and Skade.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine the O-Class cruisers, in our game represented by T9 \u00c4gir and T9 Siegfried, had been a success so that further development of their designs could have taken place. We can assume that any improvements on their designs would have likely increased displacement to allow for more anti-surface and anti-air firepower and protection, while maintaining speed for the most part. We will explore two possible designs for what could be called a \u201cSuper-\u00c4gir\u201d. One of them will be focused on improving the secondary battery, while the other will expand the main battery.\n\nBoth ships will have a similar armour scheme to \u00c4gir and Siegfried, but will receive more belt and deck armour, as well as a stretch of fore belt, similar to German T10 Cruiser Hindenburg.\n\n \n\n# T10 Donar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu8cjyeonh9d1.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc9e4a6122647028c04da44b85600490a742f13\n\nOne of our hypothetical improvements on the O-Class cruisers. This design focuses on improving the secondary and anti-aircraft battery by increasing the number of dual-purpose 128mm guns to fifteen dual mounts. \n\nShe also carries an increased torpedo armament should the fight get up close and personal.\n\nDonar is armed with 9 305mm main battery guns which deal good damage per salvo, but have a low rate of fire. The ship is also armed with sixteen torpedo tubes carrying fast, but short ranged, torpedoes.\n\nHer consumables are represented by Fast Damage Control Team, Repair Party, and Improved German Hydroacoustic Search. \n\n\\> ship's parameters\n\n* HP - 75000\n* Plating - 27mm\n* Torpedo Protection - 40%\n* Main Armament\n   * 3x3 30,5cm/56 SK C/39 \n      * Range - 18,5km\n      * Reload - 20,0s\n      * HE Shell - 30,5cm Spr.Gr.

This design focuses on improving the main battery by increasing the number of main battery turrets to 4. She still carries a torpedo armament identical to \u00c4gir to deter enemy ships from getting too close.\n\nDonar is armed with 12 305mm main battery guns which deal good damage per salvo, but have a low rate of fire.

Despite German ships usually receiving male names it is not impossible that a ship could be named after a goddess, due to her status as a deity. And this name befitting of a hunter represents what she is to do on our virtual seas, hunt those beneath her and crush any opposition. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Please note that all information in the dovolepmont bleg is utter bullshit.

That's 1.5 Schlieffens base, and probably around equal to one Schlieffen with full manual secondary stacked up, but now with no ramp up time.",

            "Yeah that's a fever dream. Germany will never get a T10 large cruiser, I am sure at this point. Maaaaaaybe at some point there will be a German CL branch, but that is it. No additional T10 cruisers."
