            "Is YouTube extremely laggy for anyone watching in 4K? I thought it was my internet connection, but even through ethernet (>700mbps) it doesn't load at all. Using Firefox on an M2 MacBook Air. If I watch through the YouTube app on my iPhone or iPad, it loads normally. Any fixes to this? Don't know much about codecs, but does the AV1 decode engine address this issue?",
            "His bad are the Thermal issue with Mac books airs? I want to get one and had order a Maxed out one and then cancel when I saw a lot about the thermals",

            "What is everyone's thoughts on the MacBook save-to-dock-as-an-app situation? I have saved many sites to my dock to use as apps and I'm starting to get a little overwhelmed by it. I'm just curious what everyone's preference is on this. Because I saved social sites like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reddit, etc. and other sites I shop at regularly like Barnes & Noble, Amazon, etc. I did this as a trial run to see if I preferred apps to sites myself and I'm starting to miss just going to the actual site through my browser. Because where does it end? Then why would I even need to use Safari after a certain point? I'm probably being dramatic and making this into a bigger deal than it is. But does anyone here find the save to dock apps useful? Or do you just use the websites? Or does it depend on the site? Would be interested to know everyone's experience with this so far.",
            "I thought I saw a crazy like $600 promo going on for a macbook air but I cant find it anyone know what im talking about?",
            "When you read online that battery life lasts 16-18 hours, how are they measuring that exactly? How long is a MacBook Air M3 battery meant to last if I use it to surf the web, stream content etc (not all the same time)? Because so far it seems like it lasts 4-5 hours like any other regular laptop, not the whopping 10+ hours?",
            "Starting to take classes again and as a working adult the only computer I \u201cown\u201d is my work laptop. I am majoring in business administration so my workload won\u2019t be that heavy (no programming or art stuff\u2014 maybe generative AI but that\u2019s it). The price differences between the M3 and M2\u2019s don\u2019t seem that bad. Anybody with experience with both what would you recommend.",
            "Hi everyone! I posted this as a separate thread a little while back, but probably makes more sense putting it here.\n\nI own a 2020 Intel MBA. For the past month or so, Safari has been quitting on its own if I don\u2019t have any Safari windows open. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a crash (I don\u2019t get any windows notifying me that it\u2019s crashed), but after 30 minutes or so of not using Safari, I\u2019ll notice it\u2019s quit on its own (ie the white dot below the Safari icon in the dock disappears), and I\u2019ll need to relaunch Safari rather than just open it, which takes slightly longer. I\u2019ve tried force quitting and restarting the computer as well as clearing the cache, but no luck. Not really a big deal, but would appreciate any thoughts or potential fixes. Thanks so much!",
            "It really depends on your own personal specific use case. How do you intend to use the machine?\n\nEg. if you are mostly using it to surf the web, watch YouTubes, do some basic word processing, spreadsheet, etc, I think this is more than fine. I think people can better help you if you are very clear about your own personal use cases.",
            "This happended to me but it stopped. Since it's so early for you, it's probably not dust/water, which is probably what happened to me.\n\nTry it with a variety of different content. Some sounds are more suited for the speakers than others. If everything sounds bad, send it in under warranty."

            "If I spend $2000 on a laptop, I want it to be perfect, opening with one finger is one of the key features of MacBooks. Also if it's too tight, it can damage the hinge itself.",
            "I think they should, but give them a call before, just to be sure.",
            "It would have to be super tight to damage the hinges, they are actually pretty beefy. But that's a good point about it being a key feature. I wasn't aware people saw it as anything more then a small neat bonus.\n\nJust as a side note, my work assigned dell latitude wouldn't open like that. But my cheaper older dell inspirion would. Never thought to try but interesting.",

After much research I went with the Air M3 16gb RAM 512SSD with a 13' display. I am beyond excited but also feel almost guilty? This is the most money l've ever spent on something in my life and it hurts in a way. I plan to keep this for as long as possible and use it to maybe go back to school and also learn programming and even photoshop or video editing. I dont know how I haven't had a half decent computer once in my whole life but this is the first time ever to own something premium. I hope this sparks my interest to learn many new things and hopefully help me get a career in working with computers like software/IT/Computer science?\nI still haven't made up my mind but now I have the tools to learn. Also If need be I may get a windows computer as well but I hope this suffice and I am excited to learn a whole new operating system! I went with the starlight color. Did I make a good choice? My mind is all over the place lol. I also own an Iphone",

The number \"14\" alone won't tell you much, because MacOS fills unused RAM with other stuff that is not really requested by the user. Try openening more programs and have a closer look at the used RAM together with the memory pressure!",
            "18 gb is well and above what is required for you. Anything above 18 gb would be needed for very specific work and would be an overkill in most use cases, including yours. Snap out of the doom you\u2019ve bought into.",

When I'm using Figma, VSC, and a couple of apps open with 33 Chrome tabs open I'm using 20 GB of memory with moderate pressure. It runs buttery smooth and I love the performance. For my use case, I don't use a lot of processing or GPU power but I'm RAM hungry. I'm really happy with what I went with and I'm glad I could find a good deal on the Apple refurbished store.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m7z1lvu7j9d1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c3548631e24ac256986324c9e683581574226ab"
