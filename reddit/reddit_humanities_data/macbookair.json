Using Firefox on an M2 MacBook Air. If I watch through the YouTube app on my iPhone or iPad, it loads normally. Any fixes to this? Don't know much about codecs, but does the AV1 decode engine address this issue?",

            "What is everyone's thoughts on the MacBook save-to-dock-as-an-app situation? I have saved many sites to my dock to use as apps and I'm starting to get a little overwhelmed by it. I'm just curious what everyone's preference is on this. Because I saved social sites like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reddit, etc. and other sites I shop at regularly like Barnes & Noble, Amazon, etc. I did this as a trial run to see if I preferred apps to sites myself and I'm starting to miss just going to the actual site through my browser. Because where does it end? Then why would I even need to use Safari after a certain point? I'm probably being dramatic and making this into a bigger deal than it is. But does anyone here find the save to dock apps useful? Or do you just use the websites? Or does it depend on the site? Would be interested to know everyone's experience with this so far.",

            "When you read online that battery life lasts 16-18 hours, how are they measuring that exactly? How long is a MacBook Air M3 battery meant to last if I use it to surf the web, stream content etc (not all the same time)? Because so far it seems like it lasts 4-5 hours like any other regular laptop, not the whopping 10+ hours?",

I am majoring in business administration so my workload won\u2019t be that heavy (no programming or art stuff\u2014 maybe generative AI but that\u2019s it). The price differences between the M3 and M2\u2019s don\u2019t seem that bad. Anybody with experience with both what would you recommend."

After much research I went with the Air M3 16gb RAM 512SSD with a 13' display. I am beyond excited but also feel almost guilty? This is the most money l've ever spent on something in my life and it hurts in a way. I plan to keep this for as long as possible and use it to maybe go back to school and also learn programming and even photoshop or video editing. I dont know how I haven't had a half decent computer once in my whole life but this is the first time ever to own something premium. I hope this sparks my interest to learn many new things and hopefully help me get a career in working with computers like software/IT/Computer science?\nI still haven't made up my mind but now I have the tools to learn. Also If need be I may get a windows computer as well but I hope this suffice and I am excited to learn a whole new operating system! I went with the starlight color. Did I make a good choice? My mind is all over the place lol. I also own an Iphone",

I usually carry a notebook, pencil pouch, and 17 ounce water bottle in my Herschel backpack. I also have loose ankle where I'm prone to sprain when I walk down the street.

And also the price gap between the two is like 400 euros at those specs \n\nI wanted for work mainly writing emails, moving around office 365 with tons of tabs open, I also will use to do my masters degree. And the fact that the air can only support two displays with the lid closed, bothers me a lot. Because my desktop at home is slowly dying after almost  12 years ( with some upgrades, obviously) and the MacBook I will buy will overthrow that.\n\nSo yea, I have exactly the same doubt.",
