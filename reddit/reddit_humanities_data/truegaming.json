            "So, Callisto Protocol does something very clever that I've never seen a game do before. It has an auto-save system (there is manual saving but it's tethered to your last auto-save), but what I really appreciate about its design is that it gives you, down the second, how long it's been since the last auto-save. I was about to quit a play session, and saw that if I manual saved, I would have lost the last eight minutes of progress (some crafting and fights I didn't want to do again). So I just played another minute or so until the next auto-save. This was SO much better than the way Dead Space 3 did it (infrequent auto-saves, and the game never communicating how much would be saved when you quit out). Granted, I prefer manual saves, but, if you're going to do auto-saves only for progress, I think this is a very informative way to do it.",

It could either or also be true that Xbox don't find him capable of leading a full studio as well. He may seem quite young at age 33 to be managing big studio. FYI I personally never think age should be a problem. I don't want to put to on him, it definitely not his fault for what happened.  \n\nAlso I am bit puzzled how they just pitching HiFi Rush 2 recently.

I know games are taking longer to make and 5-6 years are quite common but you have to wonder what the team did for that whole year besides some small patchworks and extra little goodies.\n\nI feel like some time in future we will get more information that will shed light to it. It may seem like I am trying to absolve Xbox/MS of any wrongdoing but I could care less. I am just saying to see some sense to the decision.

        "content": "I've had this concept in my mind called a \"golf game\" that once I articulated, I couldn't stop seeing all over video games. When you play an actual golf video game, it usually works something like this. You can set the angle and power of your shot, and you're trying to hit the target. The game gives you some information about where your shot will land based on the parameters you set, but it's not exact. Meanwhile, various extra variables influence your shot in hidden ways, like wind, the slope of the ground, whether it's raining, etc. In games I've played, it shows you a dotted line showing the path your ball will take, but that line reflects what would happen if there were no wind, no slope, etc. You have to account for those on your own.\n\nSo the wind is blowing west at 7mph. Okay, what does that mean? I should account for that by aiming further east than I otherwise would, but how *much* further east? The answer is there's no way for you to figure that out, you just have to play for dozens of hours until you build up a kind of subconscious intuition for how hard you should compensate for different amounts of wind.\n\nA \"golf game\" or \"golf game mechanic\" is what I call it when the outcome of a strategy in a game depends on some variables that are visible to you, but their exact impact is hidden from you and interacts with your choice of strategy in complicated ways, so the only way you can learn how to compensate for it is to just accumulate many many hours of gameplay and build an intuition. There doesn't seem to be any way to actually apply logic to deliberately take the variable into account, even if you know you're supposed to be taking into account.\n\nLots of games are like this or have elements of this. In an RTS game for example, as a beginner it's very hard to say whether your army will beat the other guy's. In principle you have all the data - okay I've got 20 knights and 10 archers, does that beat 5 spearmen and 25 swordsmen? But in practice you just play for a long time until you build up a feel for it.\n\nIs this kind of mechanic good? On the one hand it's nice that the game has depth, and you get better at it over time by building this kind of implicit knowledge. On the other hand, it's frustrating early on to know that there's nothing you can do but \"put in the time\". Obviously that's true of all skills, but something about golf game mechanics make me feel more helpless than usual. If it's just an execution skill, in *principle* I could have executed perfectly on my first try. But with golf game mechanics, I just lack the data to make the right decision, and there's nothing I can consciously do to (significantly) speed up that data acquisition phase.",

            "This happens a lot in League of Legends too. You play a champ for 500 hours and you just know how damage you can put out at any point in the game or with what items. You\u2019re not sitting there like \u201cmy ultimate does 800, my Q will do 500 but his armor will reduce it to 350.\u201d You just sort of start to get it.\n\nI think the mechanic is fine or at least a necessary evil. But it also applies something like basketball. When I shoot the ball I\u2019m not thinking \u201cokay so I\u2019m gonna do a 44 degree angle here and push with the force of 5 newtons (or whatever). I know the force I need at the FT line, 3 pt line,under the rim.

The more well known terms are games of perfect vs imperfect information and games of complete vs incomplete information.\u00a0\n\n\nPerfect vs imperfect typically describes awareness of options/moves while complete vs incomplete typically describes awareness of outcomes or payoffs. The \"golf game\" scenario might be described as a game of *perfect* but *incomplete* information (since you are aware of your options and previous moves but not fully aware of the payoffs). The wind velocity causing uncertainty in how you should play your shot.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd yeah, most games are going to have some degree of incomplete information until you have learned the rules. Especially against a thinking opponent where you could make wrong guesses about their strategy. The golf game scenario, imo, provides a far more merciful route to acquiring said information. The game allows you to repeat the exact same shot, so its simply a matter of applying that shot in different wind velocity scenarios until you've found the pattern on how it impacts its. You could probably also skip that process by just pulling the formula directly via data mining or (more likely) referring to a resource already generated by someone else. Professional chess players don't have to reinvent centuries of chess play; they build off what came before.\u00a0",

            "I think intent needs to be a factor. Because the golf game has the intent that you will learn about the other factors, like wind and slope. That intent would make it a mechanic. The RTS may not have that specific intent, but after you put 100 hours into it you can quickly crunch the numbers. And I feel like expecting the devs to assume people will play long enough to be able to do that is giving them a lot of foresight.

I would posit that this same logic underpins the reason why Game of Thrones became a cultural phenomenon \u2014 it taught you rules about its world, people learned and applied those rules to make predictions, and then those predictions were paid off (until they ultimately weren\u2019t but that\u2019s besides the point).\n\nSame with sports \u2014 not just playing them, but the entire industry that has cropped up around *talking* about sports.

I've been thinking about how these are balanced out.\n\nOn a surface level, especially in single player, the answer seems rather straight forward. If something is harder to use, it should be stronger. You get more of a reward for putting in more work, it makes sense and it is a satisfying gameplay experience.\n\nWhen considering general balance however, things get more complicated. In a PvP setting (and in some cases in single player too) you would seek a fairly even distribution of usage and should strive for balance between the available options. In this sense, harder to use options cannot be straight out better than easier ones, so what is the trade-off here?\n\nHow do you think this is or should be balanced?\n\n---\n\nI think that a lot of this comes down to the definition of \"difficulty\". It often refers to the learning curve, how in-control you feel or the risk-reward balance, not the actual skill you need to play.\n\n* A easy to pick up and hard to master character will be labelled as \"easy\" while a hard to pick up and hard to master character will be labelled as \"hard\". At the end of the day, they both are the same difficulty once mastered. Therefor, they can be of the same power.\n* A gun with high recoil and high damage will be labelled as hard, when in fact with similar skill you could expect similar damage outputs with the extra damage offsetting the missed shots.\n* A sniper rifle is often seen as a hard weapon as it often is an all or nothing weapon in head to head situations.\n\nDifficulty can also refer to how situational an option is. An all rounder weapon will be considered easy, while a close-range only weapon could be considered harder.\n\n---\n\nA teacher once told me \"something difficult is something you haven't learnt how to do yet\". While it isn't all that deep and isn't true in every situation, it stuck with me and it comes up every so often. It certainly has made writing this thread pretty complicated. I kept trying to define \"difficult\" and it just pushed back what \"difficult\" is.\n\nAfter all this, I unexpectedly fell back to thinking the first gut-feeling answer to the question is correct.

Now there is an asterix at the end of \"Things that are harder should be better\".  Because there are ton of times you could have an exception.  What if you as the game developer just don't want that thing to be very good.  Like if you are making a first person shooter you might make the melee weak because you want this to be a game about ranged combat and melee is only a last option if you run out of ammo.  You might have a vision for a PVP where each faction/character is about as good.  And that would mean even if something is harder to use it doesn't get to be better.  You don't want a situation where people master the tough stuff and than only those.\n\nLike many difficult questions the answer is \"it depends\".  In this case it depends on the direction you want to take things.  Do you want this hard to use thing to even be a major part of the game? Do you want players to abounded the easy to use things as the grow in skill to relay on the hard to use things?",
            "impossible to say definitively, the ease of use (input) to power (output) ratio is discretionary based on a ton of factors -- the genre of game, the mission statement of your team, the needs of the player base, etc. \n\nFirst Order Optimal Strategies (FOOS) or pub stomping picks are a particularly interesting byproduct of this conversation, and something that is inevitable in PvP games. Simply put, an easy to execute and somewhat highly effective strategy will become an instant pubstomping pick as the player base is immature or the skill level of the lobby is low. Stuff like the noob tube in call of duty, kirby down-B in smash bros, E.Honda 100 hand slap from Street Fighter, Zerg Rushing in sc, bastion in overwatch, etc. Things that are very easy to execute and provide devastation results simply because the opposition does not have the ability or knowledge of how to get around it. FOOS classically becomes pretty obsolete as the playerbase gets better and the lobbies become higher skill, but they can be a very sore spot for your lower skill players and could potentially harm engagement and player satisfaction if they are too polarizing. \n\nNow the developers have an interesting choice here -- do they nerf their FOOS or allow the community to figure out ways to get around it? Historically, this has ended up being answered in a multitude of ways -- game developers have gotten a lot better at creating kits/characters/moves and holistic balance is a lot more achievable, and allowing players to solve problems has always resulted in healthier play in the long run, but it's still an interesting situation that your underlying post is about. \n\nIt's really fascinating stuff, and a ton of people could probably talk for days about it lol.",
            "Hearthstone battlegrounds has an interesting solution to this that's really only viable to implement in its genre. It's a Hero-based multiplayer autobattler/deck builder, with each hero having different abilities. The thing is that some heroes abilities scale with skill very differently from most. Generally, heroes that give extra gold become much better as you improve in skill, as better players are able to leverage the resource advantage much better while unskilled players just use the extra gold inefficiently. Meanwhile heroes that lock in a playstyle or a generic buff do much better in low skill lobbies, as players there aren't able to determine a direction properly, so they tend to dominate the weaker builds of low ranked players.\n\nSo what bgs does is to simply balance heroes differently in high skill and low skill lobbies. Gold Heroes get less HP (aka Armor) in high skill lobbies, meaning they can afford to lose less fights before getting knocked out. I don't think many other games just balance high and low skill differently, but I guess few other games have HP be relatively distant from moment to moment gameplay",
            "Player-side ease of use can't be balanced. If a player becomes skilled at the concept, then using it as a balancing factor is going to falter - the extreme examples being visible on Tasvideos.\n\nIn-character ease of use can be balanced. You can have resource costs for the ability, increased activation time, and so on. \n\n> A sniper rifle is often seen as a hard weapon as it often is an all or nothing weapon in head to head situations.\n\nSnipers are actually extremely dangerous, almost guaranteeing targets getting downed without being able to do anything. When a player becomes accurate enough, the weapon is a usually-all but rarely-nothing, meaning it can dominate any 1v1 situation. If someone starts becoming \"unnaturally\" accurate with that weapon, it becomes disruptive.",
            "At the end of the day, pretty much every weapon in most games works pretty similarly, point it at your target, and press the fire button. But the difficulty of a weapon comes down to two factors, first how easy it is to learn to get good with it, and how situational it is. \n\nA standard pistol is both easy to use and can be used in most situations. Conversely, something like a rocket launcher is trickier. Yes, you can be less accurate with a rocket launcher, but you can't use it at short range without risking injuring yourself, it will typically have a small ammo capacity, and a slow rate of fire/reload speed. A rocket launcher is harder to learn to use correctly, but also is much more situational, meaning that getting kills with such a weapon is harder, requirement more skill and situational awareness than the point and shoot of a standard pistol. \n\nIt's not just about the learning curve of how to use a weapon, it's about how easy it is to kill an enemy with that weapon.",
            "I think part of this is how you're defining difficulty, as something qualitative when it's really something that can be measured quantitatively using factors such as success rate (for example the accuracy of a gun) and mastery curve (success/win rate vs. games played, possibly controlled for other factors like what else they're playing, e.g. only checking the mastery curve of a sniper rifle for players using other sniper rifles).\n\n>In this sense, harder to use options cannot be straight out better than easier ones, so what is the trade-off here?\n\nThere's not really a good answer for this because different devs are aiming for different balance goals (balancing for pro play? for beginners? average of all ranks? for high rank? nothing broken in any rank?) and each of those decisions leads to different \"correct\" outcomes. Generally speaking though, across games I played, I feel like easier options are straight up better than the harder options for most people, and it gradually gets to the harder options being straight out better at elite levels of play.",
            "I nearly scraped the whole post because it was hard to write as it is very situational and I felt like I was dancing around so many subjects that would have deserved to be more researched. Ultimately I decided to post it and hope that people would latch on to what is interesting about the topic and not where my post is lacking.\n\nI never heard of the term FOOS, though I'm aware of the concept. I adore them and hope devs don't put too much effort into getting rid of them. The utter chaos of new multiplayer games is so much fun to me. Everyone is spamming a single strategy and that tends to work against other beginners. Figuring out how to counter them is extremely rewarding, I love it. As a non-pro, it's really the only opportunity you get to participate in figuring out the meta.",
            "> E.Honda 100 hand slap from Street Fighter\n\nThis is an interesting example you brought up as this hasn't been considered FOOS in forever, not even if you go back and play SF2. Simply put, people have long figured out the counterplay to it.",
            "Interesting. I've never heard of games having different balance at different skill levels. Do you know if it was there from the start? I wonder why it was necessary. Wouldn't players who win just move to better opponents that would be able to counter them? Were there too many one-trick ponies in high rank?\n\nHow is transition between low and high rank handled? Say you are in between ranks, are you changing between different \"versions\" every few wins/losses?",
            "yeah i think devs across all of competitive pvp gaming realized that most FOOS is something to be left alone. It's only once that FOOS ends up dominating even at the highest levels of play that it might be time to move some sliders."
