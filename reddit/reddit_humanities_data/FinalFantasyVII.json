            "I think youre totally fine jumping straight into Remake. If youre curious about the original VII, you can check that out, but certainly not required. \n\nI got into Final Fantasy late as well. My first game was FFXV. I then played the original FFVII (loved it btw), Remake, FFXVI, and Rebirth. Ive enjoyed myself along the way, so dont feel bad jumping straight into Remake. It was partly made for people like you that dont want to go back to the original.",
            "Remake is a great introduction to the franchise. But after Remake, you should check out the original FFVII. It's still the best game in the series, IMO. And Remake and Rebirth will make more sense after playing OG FFVII.",
            "I beat ff7 remake a few days ago and it was my first time playing it. I never played any ff games before. Get it, its incredible",
            "FFVII is my favorite FF game and I absolutely love VII Remake/Rebirth.",
            "It's not tied to any of the older games except the original FFVII. So, there is no need to play anything else. That said, there are some weird tie-ins to the original in Remake and Rebirth we have yet to see the results of. But you can play Remake just fine on its own.",
            "My first FF game was 16 and I thought it was so good. I had FF7 remake on my ps5 for free, it must have been a free game at some point so I tried it and absolutely loved it. Then I bought FF7 Rebirth and after 5 hours or so I thought to myself how this would probably be my favorite game of all time.",
            "I say go for it, this was my second FF game, I had only played FF15 before this one, and i thought it was amazing.",
            "Each FF game is a standalone story, you dont have to have played any of the previous games.",

            "Get the complete version, it's like a director's cut that adds in several scenes and its just better overall.

After playing rebirth, remake and reunion, I have to say I much prefer Tyler. \n\nTyler is how I imagined Sephiroth sounding when I was a child. A calm, cold, calculating psychopath. No offence to George but when I went back to advent children I just couldn't stick his voice.\n\nTo me it sounds a bit anime villainy to me. I just feel Tyler portrays the calm, confident, narcissist more.\n\nEverything he says just oozes charisma. I came onto this board and see an outpour of hatred and I have to say I'm surprised.\n\nI really, really enjoyed the performance of all the voice actors.

            "I have to give him credit for the flashback scene. The way he voices \"sane\" (for lack of a better term) Sephiroth with such effortless warm charisma you can see why so many young SOLDIER's (Cloud included) hero worshipped him. Then when he does go mad his voice subtlety changes to the cold ruthless Sephiroth from the rest of the game. I feel Sephiroth is overused in these games but that's nothing to do with Tyler",
            "I still think it's crazy that George and Tyler both played Superman, as well",
            "I like his performance as well, although I didn't mind the more animeish George's performance before.\n\nFor me the gigachad of voice acting in this is Cody though. He nails Cloud so perfectly with all the different personalities he has to fit, from the cold badass SOLDIER through the goofy Zackalike to the descent into madness, there are so many sides to Cloud and he manages to show us each of them so well. I love it!",
            "For me George sounds more \"sharp and cunning\" while Tyler sounds more \"creepy and ethereal\". Both fit Sephiroth in different situations. Ultimately I prefer Tyler's voice for this character.",
            "He's not bad but they need to TURN THE VOLUME OF HIS DIALOGUE UP FFS. I literally can't tell what he's saying most of the time if it wasn't for the subtitles.",
            "When I first heard the news I was like \"really? Superman is gonna do Sephiroth? Who made that decision?\" \n\nBut I ended up absolutely loving Tyler's Sephiroth. The way he can sound calm but you can still tell there's a madness behind it is awesome to me.",
            "Theres a weight to Georges voice that Tyler cant match, but the spirit is still there.\n\nSephiroth just sounds like a coy bitch nowadays and I can appreciate that, sliding into Clouds DMs like hey wanna commit crimes against humanity, get ventriloquistd, idiot and it all just works.",
            "I slightly prefer George but find Tyler to be frankly a fantastic fit and a wonderful equivalent as Sephiroths VA. Both are amazing.",
            "Its funny that they went from superman voicing sephiroth to superman voicing sephiroth.",
            "I also love him in the role - I wish that hed comment about it or talk about the character like all the other voice actors do, but I know that hes busy. I also think there might be some component of keeping Sephiroth mysterious - pretty much anything Tyler could say would, in some way, spoil a little bit of Sephys motivations. Hes got to have thoughts on the character - he usually plays Superman, and Sephy is basically Superman gone very wrong.  Its probably copium but Im hoping hell talk more about it after the trilogy concludes."

Last Order and Dirge are entirely skippable IMO (although there are a couple of cameos/references to characters from Dirge in the remakes, a plot summary is more than enough at this point, Dirge is just not worth the hassle of seeking out a copy). \n\nFor crisis core, either version is fine. Advent Children complete is definitely superior, although these days it's kinda a moot point, since afaik complete is the only version available on streaming etc.",

            "I'd recommend release order. Ff7, ff7 advent children complete (though this version came after crisis core it is the definitive version that you're expected to watch), dirge of Cerberus, and crisis core.\n\nThere are some books that are supplemental and fans would recommend consuming but fans of the OG have the most part are having absolute blast playing the remakes. \n\nThe only game I didn't play was dirge of Cerberus. I don't feel like I've missed out at all. The remakes have done an absolutely wonderful job implementing their past titles as little nods and Easter eggs into the remakes that don't detract from the original story that remake is telling much at all. Probably enhance your enjoyment of anything. Unless you happened to dislike an entry in the compilation. \n\nHope you have fun and become a fan!"
