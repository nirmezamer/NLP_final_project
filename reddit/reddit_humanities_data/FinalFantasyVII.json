After playing rebirth, remake and reunion, I have to say I much prefer Tyler. \n\nTyler is how I imagined Sephiroth sounding when I was a child. A calm, cold, calculating psychopath. No offence to George but when I went back to advent children I just couldn't stick his voice.\n\nTo me it sounds a bit anime villainy to me. I just feel Tyler portrays the calm, confident, narcissist more.\n\nEverything he says just oozes charisma. I came onto this board and see an outpour of hatred and I have to say I'm surprised.\n\nI really, really enjoyed the performance of all the voice actors. (I usually hate jrpg voice actors because they have a tendency to ham it up.) Tifa especially.\n\nAnybody else?",

            "I have to give him credit for the flashback scene. The way he voices \"sane\" (for lack of a better term) Sephiroth with such effortless warm charisma you can see why so many young SOLDIER's (Cloud included) hero worshipped him. Then when he does go mad his voice subtlety changes to the cold ruthless Sephiroth from the rest of the game. I feel Sephiroth is overused in these games but that's nothing to do with Tyler",
            "I still think it's crazy that George and Tyler both played Superman, as well",
            "I like his performance as well, although I didn't mind the more animeish George's performance before.\n\nFor me the gigachad of voice acting in this is Cody though. He nails Cloud so perfectly with all the different personalities he has to fit, from the cold badass SOLDIER through the goofy Zackalike to the descent into madness, there are so many sides to Cloud and he manages to show us each of them so well. I love it!",
            "For me George sounds more \"sharp and cunning\" while Tyler sounds more \"creepy and ethereal\". Both fit Sephiroth in different situations. Ultimately I prefer Tyler's voice for this character.",
            "He's not bad but they need to TURN THE VOLUME OF HIS DIALOGUE UP FFS. I literally can't tell what he's saying most of the time if it wasn't for the subtitles.",
            "When I first heard the news I was like \"really? Superman is gonna do Sephiroth? Who made that decision?\" \n\nBut I ended up absolutely loving Tyler's Sephiroth. The way he can sound calm but you can still tell there's a madness behind it is awesome to me.",
            "There\u2019s a weight to George\u2019s voice that Tyler can\u2019t match, but the spirit is still there.\n\nSephiroth just sounds like a coy bitch nowadays and I can appreciate that, sliding into Cloud\u2019s DMs like \u201chey wanna commit crimes against humanity, get ventriloquist\u2019d, idiot\u201d and it all just works.",

Played it on the Switch, played it on my Steam Deck.\nWhat I'm saying is I've played a lot. \n\nEvery time I played, I get a gold chocobo so I can get KOTR.\n\nI have never gotten 7777s unless I deliberately maxed out hp and then had 2 materia assigned fighting emerald weapon.",

            "Stick with that order",
            "I'd recommend release order. Ff7, ff7 advent children complete (though this version came after crisis core it is the definitive version that you're expected to watch), dirge of Cerberus, and crisis core.\n\nThere are some books that are supplemental and fans would recommend consuming but fans of the OG have the most part are having absolute blast playing the remakes. \n\nThe only game I didn't play was dirge of Cerberus. I don't feel like I've missed out at all. The remakes have done an absolutely wonderful job implementing their past titles as little nods and Easter eggs into the remakes that don't detract from the original story that remake is telling much at all. Probably enhance your enjoyment of anything. Unless you happened to dislike an entry in the compilation. \n\nHope you have fun and become a fan!",
            "Best order imo is Ff7, Advent Children, Crisis Core, Remake, Rebirth. Last Order and Dirge are entirely skippable IMO (although there are a couple of cameos/references to characters from Dirge in the remakes, a plot summary is more than enough at this point, Dirge is just not worth the hassle of seeking out a copy). \n\nFor crisis core, either version is fine. Advent Children complete is definitely superior, although these days it's kinda a moot point, since afaik complete is the only version available on streaming etc.",
