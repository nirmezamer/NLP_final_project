However, we were a bit mixed on this, a few wanting to enforce them more, and a few wanting to be a bit more lenient. We would like to hear your thoughts on this through a few questions.  \n\\* Do you like the state of post removals?  \n\\* Is the QNA helpful at all? If it is, to what extent?  \n\\* What would be the line between keeping and over removing posts?  \n\\* A proposed solution was to change the post removal policies. What do you have to propose?",
