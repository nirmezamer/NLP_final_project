A 19-year-old hotel employee accused Bryant of raping her in his hotel room on July 1. She filed a police report and authorities questioned Bryant about bruising on the accuser's neck.

The combination of that, the alcohol, and the smoking, made him pass out from low blood pressure. He was out out, and we had to call 911. He came to before the ambulance arrived, but we had to keep his head above water, he was unable to do that himself. Later at the hospital, the ER nurses said that this happens a lot and to never ever get in a hot tub alone. If he had been alone, he would have died. None of us were drunk or partying hard. Just relaxing like regular folks in their 30s. Never get in a hot tub alone.",
