            "Almost 20 years ago, I worked for a place that had several insane uptime servers.  Several years on them.\n\nUseful enough to take pains to keep them running, but also in the territory of \"if it dies, it dies\".   We knew that they wouldn't come back up from a reboot, had lost a few servers that way.  Even with some crazy smart sysadmins, who produced amazingly detailed reverse-engineering docs, some stuff was just really really weird.\n\nWe had to close down the colo room that the servers were hosted in, had some racks in another room in the same large facility.   Each server had dual power supplies, so we set up a trolley with 2 large-ish UPS devices on the bottom shelf.  Removed all cables except power and did prep work.\n\nUnplugged one power cable, plugged it in to the UPS.  Unplugged the other, plugged that in to a separate UPS.   Transferred the server to the trolley, trundled it to the other colo room and reversed the whole process.  It worked amazingly well.  No idea how long they kept those servers running afterwards.",
