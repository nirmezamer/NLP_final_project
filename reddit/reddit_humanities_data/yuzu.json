Topics which commonly fall under this label include:\n\n* Roms\n* Keys & Firmware\n* Finding Updates and other Files\n* Non-Legitimate Yuzu Copies\n\n# 1.1) No Prerelease Game Talk\n\nIn the most recent situation with Tears of the Kingdom, any discussions related to running and playing games which haven't been officially released is also prohibited. As the only way people will have access to the game is via Piracy. \n\nSince this is a subcategory of Piracy related matters, it also adheres to similar actions.

            "hi, my pc is a laptop with 16 gb ram, intel i7 core, and an rtx 3060 graphics card. ive never had lag issues on yuzu before, but im trying to play the great ace attorney chronicles and for some reason it keeps doing these weird incremental lagspikes even though nothing graphically intensive is happening on screen. ive made sure yuzu is set to use my graphics card but i cant think of what else to do other than that. does anyone know  what might be causing this? thanks!",
            "just tried running it on ryujinx and its not giving me the issue at all so its a yuzu only thing, i guess ill just play it on ryujinx instead of yuzu but i would still really appreciate if someone could answer just for anyone that might be having the same issue or so i can understand why this is happening in the first place"

After changing the date, saving the game and heading back to menu, then playing the game again, my game would randomly skip to another day and the Isabelle cutscene starts as I'm playing. What's odd is that it skips my game 2 days ahead instead of 1. I wanted to make this post because I've been browsing the subreddit and it seems like this is a situation very unique to me. ",
