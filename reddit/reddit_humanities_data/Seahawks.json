            "lol I get what you mean but I can promise you this is my uncles real art, he did this back in 2013 before ai art was around. He told me he used pics from the sports pages when hed draw this type of stuff since he lived there",
            "Proudly hung up on my wall now",

            "Just as good? Absolutely not. I mean there are no real stakes, and half the players you see wont even make the team.\n\nTHAT SAID preseason games are super fun to attend in their own right!",
            "If youre semi local, Preseason games are fun and wayyyy cheaper than the regular season games. I snagged $25 tickets to the preseason home opener last year and had a blast. Heck, if youve never been the stadium before, what better time to check it out than when youve got cheap tickets for a preseason game? \n\nThat said, the atmosphere is nothing compared to a regular season game. Id say a preseason game is more like a day of watching baseball in terms of vibes. A lot more casual.",
            "Save your money and come for a regular season game.",
            "No. No, man. Shit, no, man. I believe you'd get your ass kicked sayin' something like that, man.",
            "The first preseason game is okay because everyone is jonesing for football. The third preseason game has historically been a decent one because the starters typically play an entire half and the first drive of the second half. Now that theres only 3, its not guaranteed who will play. It will never be as hype as a regular season game, but by all means come and enjoy the game, our city and stadium. Its still loud and pretty energetic",
            "Went to one last year. I had fun. Not as good as a regular season game but if its all you had time for or can afford I think its worth it.",
            "No. Especially because they dont play starters. They dont want injuries before the season begins.",
            "Enjoy a day out. Just don't expected too much. It's always fun to be at the stadium",
            "No. The best players sit out most of, if not all of the game and the games are meaningless to the season. It's just a way to basically get game reps before the season officially starts and figure out which players you wanna keep on your roster.",
            "There is a very noticable difference in the feeling during a preseason and a regular season game.\n\nI have had a lot of fun at preseason games though, so if you're in town during one it would absolutely be fun to go"
