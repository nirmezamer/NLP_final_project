Their automated process to suspend an account can end up flagging many people with legitimate accounts.  So when you post looking for help here, there will be some people that will take advantage of this fact and reach out to you here at Reddit.\n\nI can assure you, anyone telling you they can help \"hack\" their way into getting your service back are not here to help.  They are here to get your personal information, period.  **DO NOT FALL FOR THIS**.
