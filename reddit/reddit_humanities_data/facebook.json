My old phone is currently used by my husband and we checked, I logged out of my account many months ago and he is only using his Facebook there. Plus devices logged in only show my current device, I checked each and every session updates for the last few month. Nothing, no any new logins. How is it possible that mobile devices section still shows my previous device with today's date?",
