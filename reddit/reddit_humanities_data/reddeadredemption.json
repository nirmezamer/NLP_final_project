            "Why is my dead eye different? It doesnt do the original deadeye effect where you can shoot different people at the same time.",
            "Hey guys, I'm on my first playthrough of RDR2 and I'm near the end of the chapter 2 mission where you take out the O'Driscoll camp and have to search Colm's cabin for money in the chimney. The game prompted me to pick up a shotgun on the mantle, open the weapons menu, maintain the shotgun, and clean the shotgun. I can't clean the shotgun. I don't have any materials to do that, and the gun also says it's already clean. Now I'm physically locked in place (cannot walk anywhere or interact with anything) until I complete this seemingly impossible task? Am I missing something obvious here? \ud83d\ude05",
            "Hey I am playing after American venom and there\u2019s a drought of missions and bounties is there a way to get more missions as John after American venom besides the farm chores\u00a0",
            "I bought the game back in 2020, played it once and didn't go back. Picked it up again a couple of days ago, really enjoying it then something happened that made me recall why I hadn't played it. The save game mechanics suck, unless I'm doing something wrong? What is the best approach to saving the game to minimise disappointment and frustration. Appreciate any pointers.",
            "I started playing the online version with a couple of friends. Any suggestions on activities that we can all do to make $$$? we already finished the main missions.",
            "is there a main story? Im not far into it-maybe 2 or 3 chapters-but a lot of the missions seem to be bullshit fetch quests or just an excuse to roam around. Some of them seem like main story type of missions. And if you just want to do the main story without bullshit side missions, can you? is there a way to tell them apart? One mission was dumb as fuck, i just had to take a bag back from a coyote. It took 2 seconds.",
            "You're only in chapter 1 or 2 probably. Keep going.",
            "There are 5 levels of deadeye, each has different or additional game mechanics.  They are unlocked during certain story missions.   There's also a one-shot free-aim quickdraw dead eye mode, different than normal deadeye.  The game mechanics in this game can get a little complicated.",
            "reload the game go to gun smith buy gun oli loot chminey trust",
            "This is wild. Never considered this as a possibility. Either try and reload an old save to do it again after buying some gun oil, or (and you should do this anyway) loot all the O'Driscols after the first assault, but BEFORE going to the cabin door. Either someone will give you gun oil or it can be found somewhere near that camp fire"

My headcanon for that is that John's mother who died giving birth to him might've been a mexican prostitute.\n\nFor one,  John is very unique looking, ignoring the scars he's has very bold facial features with jet black hair. He mentions his father being Scottish which I would have never imagined John being based just off looks.\n\nThere's not a lot to prove this theory but I'm Brazilian and we are very mixed. And even as a kid I always thought John looked like a few of my uncles.\n",
