            "I am currently trying to get the bear hunter outfit and when looking at the required pelts I need, I notice several of those required are larger hides and pelts which I can only fit on the back of my horse one at a time, I'm aware that legendary pelts can't really be lost, they are just stored at the trapper, but what about the generic large pelts? Am I safe to hunt all the necessary animals and then go to the trapper or do I have to go back and forth to him everytime?",
            "I have red dead on cd for playstation 4. For an evening i deleted red dead because i wanted to try out another game and didnt have enough space. Next morning, when i tried inserting the CD to download red dead back and noticed i had scratched it. It stopped copying after 21 percent of the game disc. And this got me thinking. I have been wnting to upgrade to a ps5 and since my cd is not working anymore, can i buy red dead ultimate edition directly from playstation who is currently on discount(i didnt have the ultimate edition before) and keep my story mode progress on story mode?",
            "whenever i use a white horse, it gets this obnoxious glowy aura effect(best comparison i can think of is like the bloom lighting in TLOZ Wind Waker that was always a big complaint by fans) around it whenever the sun reflects onto it. i've tried adjusting some graphics settings(im on pc, if that info is helpful at all) and nothing seems to make a notable difference. does anyone know if there is a setting i am missing to fix it(or any graphics mods even)? \n\nit shouldn't bother me so much but i guess it just does. my brain just focuses in on it. i had finally decided to track down the white arabian to see what the hype is about and i do really like her but i just can't stand to ride with her because of that glowy effect. i've always avoided horses with any white on their backsides because of this. i might just keep a wolf pelt or something on her booty to prevent the sunlight on her white coat from blinding me, but if there is an alternate option i'd love to try that first",

            "is it normal that shadow casting from the sun is dependable on the player position ? Shadows moves as I moved with the camera in the game? That's how rdr2 engine works? or something bugged at my end?",
            "I played Red Dead 1 when it first came out for about a year and then sold my copy of it and have since forgot about most of the story. Im looking to get back into the game and give it another shot now that Im getting back into single player games. Should I start with 1 or jump right into 2?",
            "how much would a working xbox 360 promotional disk go for?",
            "You have to take every non-legendary pelt to the trapper, which means going back and forth a lot. Having a secondary horse helps with this since each horse can carry one large pelt.",
            "Once you sell a perfect pelt to the Trapper, he keeps it forever.\n\nAlso, capture or steal an extra horse as a temporary horse when you go hunting, and you can carry two large pelts at once."
