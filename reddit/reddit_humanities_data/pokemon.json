            "Around 2016 I remember finding out that I could transfer Pok\u00e9mon from an online site called PokEdits. Going onto it today, though seems to bring up some dork who I assume must've taken the domain name to sell people used 3DS and Nintendo products I remember using the site once or twice just to be able to make a cute little Pok\u00e9mon and then I would be able to trade it to myself so I guess the best thing l'm looking for is something that is a Pok\u00e9mon generator and saves to a .PKM file so I could put it in Shiny 2-1/2 and traded to myself. I'm sure if you look it up you can see they had a pretty nice interface that made it pretty easy for someone like me who doesn't really know that much about the inner workings of Pok\u00e9mon (like IVs or EV's).\n\nDoes anyone know if there are any other sites like this or better yet if PokEdits is still up because l've tried looking at the wikiHow page that sends you straight to the page and I seem to always get the message saying that the site took too long to respond. I've even tried looking through some YouTube videos, a would get the same response when I tried click on their link to the site. Archive did not work either.\n\n(if this looks familiar because I posted this as a regular post and it got taken down and the moderators told me to post here)",
