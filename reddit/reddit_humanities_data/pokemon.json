            "What is the current situation with the 3DS eShop? I am very out of the loop with Pokemon right now but want to jump back in with those games. \n\nI remember the eShop shut down and, if you didn't already own something, there is no way to buy it now. But now I'm hearing that downloading from the eShop is also disabled? If that is the case, are eShop games that I purchased totally inaccessible now?",
            "When can you catch swinub in pokemon platinum? I've never played platinum, but will be getting it soon and am planning a team for it. Right now I'm looking to get my hands on a ground type for the canalave gym, but I don't know if route 217 is inaccessible until after the canalave gym or not.",
            "So i have a question about Sword/Shield and its a interesting one. so i have been trying to shiny hunt all possible roaming pokemon in the wild (so no random shaking grass encounters mons i will be breeding those) which means seeing Brilliant Pokmon spawning is really good. though i CAN'T seem to find a list of all possible \"roaming pokemon in Sw/Sh\" or \"Pokmon that don't show up as roaming\" i know Pumpkaboo is one of the roaming pokemon BUT here is the thing. i have a small (need another small) and Average (got both it and evo), i need large and Extra Large; my question is does knocking out small and Average versions of Pumpkaboo spawn Brilliant versions of the Large and Extra Large or would i have to knock THOSE ones out instead? also before someone says that i could look at each page of pokemon Sw/Sh and note down what pokemon roam and ones that don't... there is over 300 locations AND there is weather depending ones too",
            "How do critical captures work? I'm trying to catch Miraidon in a beast ball and so I wanted to know about the chance of them happening and the capture rate of one.",
            "Is there a tool that will take a save file from Red and \"translate\" it to an equivalent FireRed save? \n\nI recovered a save from an old computer and would like to pick back up playing it, but with the better graphics.",
            "Playing FRLG for the first time. I know that when you progress through gyms more items become available in the pokemart. So right now, I'm 5 gyms in and can now get hyper potions. However, I'm noticing that potions and super potions are no longer available. Why would they do this? Potion and super potion still have uses IMO.\n\nAm I missing something?",
            "What's a good spot to grind for levels in Ruby/Sapphire before E4? Obvious answer is Victory Road, but the pokemon there are only around lvl40. The rematch feature in gen3 Hoenn is extremely inconsistent and slow. Sky Pillar has amazing wild levels but is only accessible after E4. My only other idea is chasing around Gabbi and Ty and fighting them infinitely?",
            "How is the order of the TMs determined in each generation? Why was Mega Punch the first TM?",
            "I can't get the Celebi event in Soul Silver to work. The Celebi says it was a fateful encounter and has GAMESTP as the OT. I walk up to the shrine, and nothing happens. Is there anything I'm missing?",
            "Question:\n\nCan you use humungo sandwich power to get a giant gimmighoul from a tower, the ruins or any other of the places where it appears? Either in the main game or dlc areas."

The Chain Ball has a great design too, though I think it gets in the way of the Timer Ball. And the Dubious Ball should get in provided there is some kind of quest that introduces it first."
