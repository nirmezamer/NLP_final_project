            "Anyone have any examples of coherent and cool looking work + play battle stations? I work from home and have a standing desk for my work setup, I'm also looking to have a standing desk setup for my gaming desk setup. I'm leaning towards using a standing L-shaped desk and having my work setup on one side, gaming setup on the other, but open to using two separate standing desks as well. Any suggestions are appreciated!",
            "Meta: Why do so many people ask for \u201csuggestions\u201d? Or ask questions like \u201cis this okay?\u201d.  A setup is completely subjective to that person. If it works, it\u2019s a good setup. Has always bugged me for some reason. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval lol"

            "I'd do what you like and feels right to you \n\nCatering your setup to other people when you're the only one using it is weird. Not saying you can't take others opinions but your line about it being too distant and getting bashed for it kind of shows what I'm talking about.",

            "This is nice, stacked monitors should really be an option only when space is limited. The gap looks nice but I personally wouldn't do it, but as long as you like it it's good",
