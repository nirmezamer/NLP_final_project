            "Anyone have any examples of coherent and cool looking work + play battle stations? I work from home and have a standing desk for my work setup, I'm also looking to have a standing desk setup for my gaming desk setup. I'm leaning towards using a standing L-shaped desk and having my work setup on one side, gaming setup on the other, but open to using two separate standing desks as well. Any suggestions are appreciated!",
            "Meta: Why do so many people ask for \u201csuggestions\u201d? Or ask questions like \u201cis this okay?\u201d.  A setup is completely subjective to that person. If it works, it\u2019s a good setup. Has always bugged me for some reason. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval lol"

            "Vertical second monitor > stacked. it wont mess with your neck and you'd have 2 tablet-size screens for Spotify / chats / videos."
