            "I've read your White Paper, and I understand your decentralization is adaptive and works on different scales, and lies on different L2s. Whereas the L1 is purely taking care of the security. \n\nAnd if I understand right, you have L2s that specialize more in speed and scalability priority, are more efficient at dealing with things like smart contracts, but you have L2s focusing on stronger decentralization. \n\nWhat mechanism is in place to ensure an L2 has stronger decentralization priority? Realistically, what is the level of decentralization we can expect from the more decentralized L2? How would that level of decentralization stack up against other major decentralized chains?",

Not too shabby. With [users being able to earn Karma towards Moon Distributions in just a few days ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1diuurj/an_update_from_the_mod_team_of_rcryptocurrency/)I have to wonder, if we'll see an uptick in special members as users look to be able to comment Gifs.\n\n**----------**\n\n**Since Special Memberships returned we've been busy brainstorming ways to make an rCC Special Membership.... well more special.**\n\nThe first idea coming up for a vote on this MoonWeek will be allowing Special Members to post high quality images on r/CC as a perk of Special Membership. Image posts tend to get a lot of engagement on r/CryptoCurrency which would increase participation on CC - and risk a slight decrease to sub quality.\n\nThe second idea that's been discussed is the return of Memes for special members, this one is not coming up for a vote and needs further discussion in Meta. If this comes up for a vote it will likely include a topic limit of 2 in the top 50, so the sub wouldn't be overran with Memes. Again this comes with the cost of decreasing quality but increasing participation. (2 out of the top 50 posts being Memes isn't a huge decrease in quality)\n\n**----------**\n\nThe amount of Moons you are required to burn to purchase a special Membership will be updated around MoonWeek 50 in just a few days, based off of the current cost of Moons it will probably increase slightly. (burn cost of monthly special memberships is repegged to $5 each MoonWeek)\n\nIf you have any feedback or further ideas on how we could make Special Memberships more Special, leave them as a comment on this post!",

            "I\u2019m curious what people think about the current price of 24 moons per months. Should it be higher? Lower? \n\nMy first thought is more usage would be great, even if it means fewer moons burned",
            "My only regret for getting an annual membership is having to wait a year to see what color square I have.  \n\n\nThese first world problems are brutal.",

            "More people creating a wallet and using them, beats burning larger amounts of Moons. \n\nMoons are deflationary now and are not getting minted and only getting burned. So burning them isn't as necessary.",
