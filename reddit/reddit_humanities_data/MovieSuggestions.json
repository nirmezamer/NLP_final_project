Reddit's universal \\>!Spoiler Tags!< are mandatory when discussing plot details of movies.\n\n3. If you wish to be banned, do any of the following: Be rude, harass, ignore the subreddit's rules, promote your site/blog/article/channel/etc., promote your app/company, or post about a movie you worked on. [This subreddit isn't your link farm.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion#wiki_guidelines_for_self-promotion_on_reddit)\n\n4. Due to Administrators' past actions against this subreddit, we have a ***ZERO*** tolerance policy regarding piracy. You will be banned if you request or share links to full features, if you ask or inform how to pirate, or if you mention a pirating site/app/etc.\n\n5. For Requesting posts:\n  * Use a descriptive title that lets people know if they might be able to help or not\n  * Double check that your request wouldn't be more suitable in one of the subreddits outlined in Rule #8\n  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality requests and suggestions\n\n6. For Suggesting posts:\n  * Suggest a single film, and no more than one every 24 hours\n  * Mandatory: Include the Title of the Film in the Title of the Post\n  * Encouraged: Using this format: *Film Name (Year)*\n  * Whet the appetite, don't go into detail\n  * Do not repeat a Suggestion that has been posted in the last 3 months\n  * Don't suggest a Barred Film (listed in the sidebar/wiki)\n  * Only suggest a film you've seen and enjoyed\n  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality suggestions\n\n7.

Participate!\n\n---\n\n# Barred Suggestions\nBarred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.\n\nBarred Suggests| | | |\n---|---|----|----\n12 Angry Men (1957)|Coherence|Donnie Darko|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|\nEverything Everywhere All at Once|Knives Out|The Man from Earth|Oldboy (2003)|\nParasite (2019)|The Prestige|Whiplash|\n\n**Pro Tip**: This means these movies are *really* good and you should probably check them out.\n\n---\n#Optimal Use\nThis subreddit shouldn't be used for reviews, blindly suggesting lists of movies or just asking for generally universal acclaimed films. Google can easily supply all of those answers. The best way to use this subreddit is understanding that you're leveraging crowdsourcing to identify an itch to scratch. If you don't know specifically what you're looking for, then a Googled question will answer you.\n\nYou can easily find top Sci-Fi, Horror, Drama and all of the genres with a search. Someone has already asked and answered so many common requests: Top Korean New Wave, Grounded Science Fiction, Universally Acclaimed Movies, Specific Types of Horror or Thrillers; and so much more. The optimal use of this subreddit is when your question requires a human intelligence. Each time you ask for a movie to watch, the replies will be tailored *exactly for you*. Give as much detail as possible for what you're looking for and you'll be surprised at some of the answers.\n\n#If you think you have a generic question, check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index#wiki_faq).\n\nIf you've begun to trust this community with their picks, we do have plenty of Monthly Round-ups of Best Movies:\n\nTop Movies|

I haven't had my hand on the pulse of the subreddit for the last little while, so I don't know which of these should still count or what should be added.\n\nHidden Gems| | | |\n---|---|---|---|\n[Aniara (2019)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/496743)|[Bad Genius (2017)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/455714)|[Border (2018)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/517839-grans)|[Brawl in Cell Block 99 (2017)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/398175)|\n[Frailty (2001)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/12149-frailty)|[The Guilty (2018)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/486947)|[The Invisible Guest (2017)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/411088)|[It's Such a Beautiful Day (2012)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/489412)|\n[Killer Joe (2011)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/73567)|[The Limey (1999)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10388)|[Never Let Me Go (2010)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/42188)|[One Cut of the Dead (2017)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/513434)|\n[The Quiet Earth (1985)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10176)|[Revenge (2017)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/467938)|[Riders of Justice (2020)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/663870-retfaerdighedens-ryttere)|[Session 9 (2001)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10972)|\n[Turbo Kid (2015)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/310135)|[Wake in Fright (1971)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/26405)| \n\nBasically, a Hidden Gem should fall off of this list if it becomes too mainstream, an example that I can think of would be Bone Tomahawk being mentioned in any thread even tangentially related to a Western. It, Coherence and Man from Earth are examples of films that have hit full saturation on the internet as far as I am concerned. \n\nA Hidden Gem should be added to this list if it is a flick you only really see mentioned in this subreddit; something that is probably too weird and different to be something you'd spring on a Rando but definitely an incredible pick for someone who is looking for something specific.\n\nI almost want to add Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky with how much of a surge of suggestions it's had but that could be because I watched that ridiculous monstrosity a few months ago.\n\n## Moderator Line-Up\n\nMore moderators would be nice but I guess people are fine with how this dumpster fire dumpsters.\n\nAgain, I would like to thank everybody on the list; you've made this subreddit what it is today.\n\n## Quality Posters\n\nYou may have noticed that some users have a 'Quality Poster \ud83d\udc4d' Flair. This is to honour those who spend time to make the Subreddit work with their frequent on-topic Suggestions. It's a way to recognize their work and it's a nice way to know if someone's Suggestions are good. These are users I've noticed contributing to the subreddit and so they get their Quality Poster Flair:\n\n- /u/christofh88 \n- /u/cyrano_no \n- /u/jeanmorel \n- /u/joelypoely88 \n- /u/nesquik44 \n- /u/philhelmscream \n- /u/silent1900 \n- /u/wolver8ne \n\n\nThe rough methodology I use is that I Upvote good comments and the Reddit Enhancement Suite keeps track of Upvotes. Once I've noticed someone has accumulated 10 Upvotes from me, I Tag them for evaluation in the next Town Hall. When I evaluate someone, I check to see if the Upvotes came from /r/MovieSuggestions Subreddit instead of perhaps from somewhere else - I do believe in courtesy Upvoting so people get their pluses from me. If they've been active for the last few weeks and the upvotes I gave are from this Subreddit, I apply the 'Quality Poster \ud83d\udc4d' Flair in the next Town Hall.\n\nSometimes other Moderators will mention a name or two when I do a 'pulse check' before putting up this Sticky. I ask if there are any topics they want hashed out or if they want to nominate anyone for being a QP. Most of the time, when they have a nomination for someone they see doing excellent work, they are already on my 'To Be Flaired' list. But not all the time, hence why I try to do the pulse check.\n\nBy the way, as an additional Thank You for Quality Posters is that they get to participate in a 'Critics Choice' voting thread for End of Year Best Movies. Unfortunately, some of you had DMs blocked and so I couldn't ask what you wanted. If you'd like to participate in End of Year Critics Choice, Whitelist my account.\n\n## Sidebar\nWe've added these to the sidebar due to their utility:\n\n- www.chronolists.com\n- www.doesthedogdie.com\n- www.kids-in-mind.com\n- www.movieguide.org\n- www.runpee.com\n- www.familymoviedb.com\n\nShould there be any other useful websites you can think of that we can cram there?\n\n## State of the Subreddit\n\nThe subreddit has grown to 1.4m subscribers from 1.3m four months ago.\n\nTop 100 now has over 10,000 votes, with 11 votes being the minimum to show up in the Top 100. I had thought it was 10,000 before but I screwed up the giant Google worksheet. It's fine now. We're two shy of 12 vote minimum. It's also nice to see that older movies are peppered in, instead of flavour of the month.\n\nParasite sits head and shoulders above every other movie in the Top 10; Parasite has 38 Votes compared to Everything Everywhere All at Once's 2nd place of 28 and Minari's tenth place of 19. While Dune: Part Two had a meteoric debut, it still did not beat Another Round for highest debut. I suspect Dune: Part Two will probably hit the Top 10 by the end of the year, especially with the Top of 2024 Votes.\n\n**********\n\n# New Business\n\n## Anti-LGBT Requests\nIt has been a long standing policy to not police what people request. I don't know why nor do I care about what filth you want to watch; whether that's revenge porn, effectively what is porn, gore, hand holding or whatever perversion you want to consume in your media. You have a particular itch and this community is used to find the scratch. If you find the person or content objectionable? That is easily solved too - don't help them. If you want extra vindication, downvote and block.\n\nUnfortunately, there's been a lot of vitriol towards people asking for movies without any LGBT content. On one hand, I do not want this subreddit to be a safe space for Nazis especially with the rise of facism. On the other, I don't want to constantly go into the comment section and nuke everything because otherwise they'd continue their flame war. Once we start curtailing one flavour, we then need to start thinking about others.\n\nWe do not have the bodies to moderate this effectively. I have been a proponent for moderation is best done like golf; the least possible. That means the only solution I can see is have a post be removed if anyone reports it. Does that sound easily abusable? Absolutely. Are movies that request eroticism or non-traditional relationships reported by trolls? You bet. Could we get more moderators? Sure, but we're volunteers, we shouldn't be making morality calls as that differs from region to region.\n\nFurthermore, 'Need More Mods' has been hammered as a subject ever since I've started doing Town Halls. Hell, the most staffed we've ever been still needed non-North American mods, otherwise we'd awaken to an evening of shitpostery from people who live on the upside down part of the world.\n\n## Modifying Post Flairs\nI'm sorry I don't have the person's name in my notes but they've come up with a decent solution for the Wrong Flairs. Instead of \"Requesting\" and \"Suggesting\", their suggestion was \"I'm Requesting\" and \"I'm Suggesting\". I can see it kind of be ruining from an aesthetic point of view, but damn, it should cut down on people wondering why they're not getting Suggestions when they've selected the 'Suggesting' Flair.\n\nAny objections? Thoughts?\n\n## Overzealous Harassment Filter\nIt's not often I enjoy a change Reddit makes because everyone knows how you find something is its peak and change is scary but I am enjoying the deployment of the Harassment Filter. Most of the time it filters people because they're quoting the movie which isn't even a constructive addition to a conversation. For example, if someone mentions Pulp Fiction, there's a litany of quotes from that movie that would get Auto-Removed as a form of harassment due to its content. From what I understand, if you get too many of these, your account gets dumped with a sitewide Shadowban.\n\nI figure I should ask, should we be approving these pointless, potentially offensive quotes or let the user rot? We have removed reported replies in the past to which the person says \"It's a movie quote!\" I, for one, like to not have to deal with their indignation as Reddit has decided to systematically remove their inanity.\n\n**********\n\nThat's all I can think of that were problems over the last couple months. If you can think of anything else, post 'em below. Respond to any of the topics you feel comfortable talking about and your opinion. We'll hash something out. Thank you.",

            "That still falls within Requesting.\n\nHell, I think the sub (at least those who bother to post in these) don't like these types of posts. It reduces their ability to vomit out lists which is what they prefer to do.",
            "That's why I am contemplating the suggestion of changing the Blue and Red Flairs of Suggestng and Requesting to \"I'm Suggesting\" and \"I'm Requesting\". An eyesore, but hopefully easier for people to navigate; i.e. when they want to roll the dice on a pick, they can click on the I'm Suggesting Flair.",
            "The problem isn't so much that it's not descriptive enough, it's that there's a post with the exact same request every 3 hours. Right now there are three posts asking for mindfuck movies in the top 10 of Hot, and another two in the top 15 of new.\n\nI don't have a solution besides yelling at people to search first on the New Post page (which isn't a solution because it doesn't work anyway). I just wanted to second that I think it's a problem.",
            "Shit, at this point we should just sticky the larger threads like that and make any repeated requests for the month reportable or something. Because honestly not only are the posts the same, but the suggestions are always the exact same handful of movies with maybe one diamond in the rough.",
            "True. Like I'd say put it in the FAQ/Wiki or the sidebar but it's not like those people are every going to look there before posting anyway lol\n\nBut yeah maybe just have to add some sort of reportable rule for it.",
            "You could just say it's a sort of \"quality control\" to word it a bit nicer while conveying the same message. But yeah it's not like reddit has been helping.",
            "I understand about not wanting to police what people posts, but there has been so many posts of I want a mindfuck movie/I want to cry/I want to laugh/etc. Which is fine, but too often they don't list any examples of what they've seen.\n\nIs there a way to get the AutoMod to share resources? Share the Community Favorite's that fit whatever the person is looking for. Share the subreddit's search engine with the crying/laughing/mindfuck (whatever it is that they're looking for). \n\nJust an idea.",
            "I have a Suggestion that There should be another Flair that is ShoudIWatch along with Suggesting and Requesting I think it fits this Sub as well a most common question in People's mind is Not Only which movie should I watch but also should I watch this Movie \n\n\nFor example I've heard a lot about this Xyz movie this is what I'm expecting from this and this is what I Like should I watch this Movie?",
            "It definitely is but until I figure out some kind of reasonable test, I rather not act.\n\nFor example, when it comes to generic titles, the stipulation is a title that attracts and repels. You need to be attracted to the title to help the perrson, you need to be repelled if they clearly state what they're looking for which you know you cannot help. Usually that includes a specificity towards a particular genre; a 'mindfuck' is a Twisty Thriller. That's precise enough to include two genres, you can understand them and you know if you're able to help or not.\n\nI don't know of a good policy to set besides \"Stop being such a basic bitch\" which we've already done by making our generic titles rule as onerous as it is."
