            "hello! my boyfriend is a train enthusiast and id like to get him a railway map of europe (or many individual maps of each country). my idea is to get it printed big and nice but in such a way that he can color in the journeys he has taken. if someone sells something like this thats good, but if i have to just find maps and then have them printed myself that is also okay. maybe i can make a binder with each country map printed separately.  \nso i guess the question is: does anyone know very nice, rather minimalistic railway maps of european countries that I can buy, digitally or phisically? thank youuu",
            "Always been *kinda* into trains, but now that I'm getting into things like electronics and such, it's the *perfect* excuse to go crazy about train history, *especially* the designs. Already found things like the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard and the [Chesapeake and Ohio No. 490](https://redd.it/17twlnr). What's some good reading material to go over the history/development of trains & train designs? \n\nI'm a Canuck from Montreal, so if there are some great books in French you weren't sure could be suggested, definitely send them my way! Not that I won't take the English books...",
