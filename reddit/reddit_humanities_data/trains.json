            "Press the button to recline the seat, press it down then sorta push yourself forwards",
            "Thats the eject button, press it in case of emergency to be flung out of the train into the nearest field",
            "Haha we just rode the LNER to Edinburgh for the first time last night and were scared to touch that button too haha.\nThe first class service was awesome. They kept us in beer from start to finish!",
            "Everything you press it, it raises the cost of your next train ticket by 5%",
            "Everytime you press it a 'taillie' gets a hand frozen off.",
            "Nothing harmful. You wouldn't be able to push it. It's the seat recline.",
            "Click the button and it'll let You drive. The train driver will come out of the locomotive and ask You to drive.",
            "youre a genius, i was scared to press incase it contacted staff lol now comfily reclined! thanks!",
            "This. It is also sensitive to intelligence, if you need to ask on reddit what does such a button do, you're ejected immediately.",
            "Grear answer. Even more likely if your fellow passenger introduces himself thus: \"Hello. My name is Bond. James Bond\"."

            "You can see a BNSF version pretty much every day on the Trains.com New Rochelle IL webcam. An extra run happens to and from the UP yard and it typically has an old BN caboose as a shoving platform.",
            "That's a shoving platform,  not a \"real\" caboose.",
            "I love seeing them on the LIRR, they use them as work site offices as far as I am aware on the LIRR. Likely MNRR too but I don't take that as much as I would like to.",
            "Is this Milwaukee? I gotta see if there's a caboose in the yard there",
            "It be.  However this was a few days ago, but also not the first time I have see it go by.",
            "Why would DOD be in a caboose?",
            "I'll have to message some people in the area to see if anyone knows anything",
            "The US department of defense/department of energy does occasionally move things by rail. This is generally stuff they don't want people randomly touching. The most talked about cargo in this category is generally spent nuclear fuel and/or high level radioactive waste. That's not the kind of stuff that you want people walking up to and also the kind of stuff you want people on site for IMMEDIATELY if the train derails. \n\nThat's why the DOD has cabooses.",
            "TBH if you see a real caboose these days it's probably a DOD load and the caboose isn't full of friendly crew, but DOD peeps with fully automatic weapons and the burning desire to use them.",
            "What an honor"
