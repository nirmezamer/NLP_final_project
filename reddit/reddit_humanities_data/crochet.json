            "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is my first time posting to reddit (I've been a silent watcher/reader for years, though).  \nI have a small little handknitting/crochet page on Facebook ([Rae's Knitting Corner](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556576906249)) and TikTok (@raedellart) that I'm slowly growing and working on to help pay medical bills and make ends meet. I primarily make pet beds (perfect for cats and small dogs but I do accept custom orders for medium/large dogs, too). I also make soft chunky blankets and throws and the occasional plushie.\n\nThis month I wanted to do some special for Pride and created a Pride themed collection of pet beds and their matching turtles. I think they all came out absolutely adorable. The pet beds are $65 and the turtles are $25. If purchased together as a set (1 bed, 1 turtle) you'll get a $10 discount, so the total would be $80 (plus shipping). Payments can be split when paying via PayPal.\n\nVery limited supply but pre-orders are accepted (there may be a 2 week delay for any orders that need yarn re-ordered for the project).\n\nI greatly appreciate any sharing, comments, and support! I've been unable to work for the past 6 months due to complications from a surgery in December, so crochet and handknitting has been a way for me to try and help reduce some of the financial burden.\n\nFeel free to message me directly here or via my Facebook/TikTok pages to place an order.\n\nThank you! \\^\\_\\^\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4340x4durm8d1.jpeg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbdf290247a7bec3fd02b8318d1da998130feefe",

Sometimes life gets in the way; what, with taking care of our deck, trying to climb the corporate ladder and making attempts at keeping myself and my wife sane and grounded, sometimes things slip. But, I am back at it and we have some more selections to look through.\n\nThis month we have a ton more outdoors and food related days, seems to be a common theme in the summer when we, in the northern hemisphere at least, have warmer weather to enjoy the outdoors. We obviously have the 4th of July in the states, and as such I expect to see a few red, white and blue choices; and while it is a major holiday, it is a US holiday. So, instead, I\u2019ll focus on the other \u201cnational days of\u201d choices we have. We had repetitive patterns in June, we can see that same similar repetitive feature in July. So, I think we are going to go with food and clothing patterns; essentially, something you need to for eating outdoors aka Picnicking.\n\nWith the preamble out of the way, onward towards the selections:\n\n1) [Summer brimmed hat](https://www.handylittleme.com/crochet-summer-hat/) by [Louise](https://www.handylittleme.com/)\n\n2) [Summer Bucket Hat](https://www.hookedonhomemadehappiness.com/beach-day-bucket-hat-crochet-pattern-cal-for-a-cause/) by [Breann](https://www.hookedonhomemadehappiness.com/)\n\n3) [String Shopping Bag](https://www.mamainastitch.com/how-to-crochet-a-string-shopping-bag/) by [Jessica](https://www.mamainastitch.com/)\n\n4) [Farmers Market Bag](https://jewelsandjones.com/crochet-farmers-market-bag-free-pattern/) by [Nicky](https://jewelsandjones.com/)\n\n5) [Al Fresco Picnic Set](https://undergroundcrafter.com/2024/06/07/weekend-mystery-cal-12/) by [Marie](https://undergroundcrafter.com/)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1do6nw6)",
