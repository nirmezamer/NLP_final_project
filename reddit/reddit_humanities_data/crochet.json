Sometimes life gets in the way; what, with taking care of our deck, trying to climb the corporate ladder and making attempts at keeping myself and my wife sane and grounded, sometimes things slip. But, I am back at it and we have some more selections to look through.\n\nThis month we have a ton more outdoors and food related days, seems to be a common theme in the summer when we, in the northern hemisphere at least, have warmer weather to enjoy the outdoors. We obviously have the 4th of July in the states, and as such I expect to see a few red, white and blue choices; and while it is a major holiday, it is a US holiday. So, instead, I\u2019ll focus on the other \u201cnational days of\u201d choices we have. We had repetitive patterns in June, we can see that same similar repetitive feature in July. So, I think we are going to go with food and clothing patterns; essentially, something you need to for eating outdoors aka Picnicking.\n\nWith the preamble out of the way, onward towards the selections:\n\n1) [Summer brimmed hat](https://www.handylittleme.com/crochet-summer-hat/) by [Louise](https://www.handylittleme.com/)\n\n2) [Summer Bucket Hat](https://www.hookedonhomemadehappiness.com/beach-day-bucket-hat-crochet-pattern-cal-for-a-cause/) by [Breann](https://www.hookedonhomemadehappiness.com/)\n\n3) [String Shopping Bag](https://www.mamainastitch.com/how-to-crochet-a-string-shopping-bag/) by [Jessica](https://www.mamainastitch.com/)\n\n4) [Farmers Market Bag](https://jewelsandjones.com/crochet-farmers-market-bag-free-pattern/) by [Nicky](https://jewelsandjones.com/)\n\n5) [Al Fresco Picnic Set](https://undergroundcrafter.com/2024/06/07/weekend-mystery-cal-12/) by [Marie](https://undergroundcrafter.com/)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1do6nw6)",
