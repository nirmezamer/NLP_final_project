I'm running a Sapphire Pulse RX 580 and a Ryzen 5 3600 with 16GB of ram, which I purchased in 2019, right before Covid hit.\n\nNow I'm wondering, should I go all out and build a whole new PC, or should I take what I can from my current PC and just upgrade the GPU and probably the CPU as well? I'm stuck on a B450, which iirc should be capable of running a Ryzen 7 5800X3D.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?\n\nEdit:   \n[Part List - AMD Ryzen 5 3600, Radeon RX 580 - PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4CWmt7)",

You seem to be booked up right. \n\nThe cooler is either not mounted right or the peel of sticker is still there.\n\nGet some good thermal paste is your out. Remove your cooler and clean cpu and cooler base of all thermal compound.\n\nUse a modest amount. While too little is bad, too much can cause other issues down the road.\n\nA good X with a few dots in the gaps works for me.\n\nMost coolers use spring tension. You shouldn't be able to move the heatsink at all if it's mounted right.\n\nYou are almost there, and the cpu mobo is doing what they should in this case, so don't worry if they are damaged. They should be fine.",
