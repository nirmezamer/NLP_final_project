            "Anyone got any tips for building a dirt cheap PC? I'm trying to build a functional tower for as low as possible, to get away from my old potato laptop. Thanks in advance for the tips! ",
            "Recommend CPU cooler for i5-12600kf. NO overclocking. budget 25 euro",
            "cervvo or aisurix? (both rx 580s, new and legit)",
            "How much would it cost to build a PC that's capable of playing stuff like Elden Ring, World of Warcraft, FFXIV, maybe a few other games but nothing hyper resource intensive. I haven't built a PC in about 10 years so I imagine a decent amount has changed",
            "I used to have dual monitors, one on HDMI and one on DVI. This worked perfectly for many years. I recently decided to upgrade both to newer monitors, and now my only choice is to use HDMI on one, and Displayport on the other. Now when I wake my PC from sleep, it seems to dump everything I had open onto the first monitor, meaning I need to manually drag everything back over to the second monitor every time. It's so annoying. I am assuming it thinks the 2nd monitor is disconnecting, instead of just turning off, and therefore puts everything onto monitor 1.\n\nIs there some way around this?",
            "hey guys, i want to buy a rtx 4070 but i only have a 600W power supply, will it be fine?",
            "Looks very good overall.. few questions why not looking at i7-13700kf instead since you have dedicated gpu, and second does the mbo have wifi(if not could look to get one with) very similar to what i am planning to buy as well.. though still cannot justify such a spent and contemplating if instead i should get a pa5",
            "I'm happy playing stuff on medium graphics, I currently play everything on a laptop so I'd like something with just a slightly bit more oomph than that :) thank you, ill look into AMD for budget.",
            "Good luck with your build - I'm about to build a \"mid-range\" AMD build and our bill came to around 1200 including a cheap 1080p 240mhz monitor but we went a bit OTT on things like cooling, ram and storage. I think I could have reasonably done this for about 1000.",
            "It really depends on what your expectations are. Do you want to play 4k, ultra quality at 200fps? You're going to need to put more money in. On the otherhand, if you're ok playing at 1080p medium/high settings you can spend a lot less. There are loads of PC build videos on YouTube from the likes of zach's tech turf where he builds pretty capable machines for around $800. \n\nI think the general rule of thumb is that you should spend around half the total cost of your PC on the GPU. So if you want that top-end 4k gaming experience you may to want a 4080 GPU which runs about $1000 so your total PC cost is going to be around $2000. If you're willing to go lower (maybe 1440p) then you can go with a lower spec graphics card like a 4070 GPU for around $800 and your PC total will be more like $1600. \n\nThese are based on Intel/Nvidia based setups but you can often get more bang for your buck by going with AMD based processor and GPU."

            "Thats not a 3090 Ti. Ask what i7 that is. I wouldnt want to meet with them and just let the offer go since they sell their PC on snapchat. Sounds like a serial killer to me.",

            "Definitely not a 3090 TI. Way too small. And the processor being an I7 is super vague. Same goes for the 32gb ram. Whats the clock speed/brand? What kind of SSD? How many gb for the ssd? All of that looks like a prebuilt honestly. I think youre better off building your own if youre ready to drop $1K on a PC. Theres tons of tutorials and especially if you use the pcpartpicker website.",
