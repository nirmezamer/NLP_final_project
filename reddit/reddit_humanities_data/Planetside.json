Initially, we spent a lot of time playing the game and reading through player feedback on the forums and Reddit.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ap7rs2r34l8d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=846977f7c3f597e20d4b90f839a24e2a41da5799\n\nThis turned out to be very helpful in both establishing what we would value ourselves, while also learning what you, the players, would like to see happening to the game. At the end of this dev letter, we have also provided a survey which if answered would help us to work even more toward what our player base wants.\u00a0\n\n# Bug fixes and optimization\u00a0\n\nOur focus so far has mainly been on bug fixes and carefully updating existing sounds. This has resulted in updates like fixing audio/animation desynchronization issues, and a larger fix for weapons that would spam multiple sound cues when tapping quickly.\u00a0\n\nOur most recent submission is a\u00a0*potential*\u00a0fix for the big audio dropout issue. This has been on our radar since the beginning, but since the issue has no clear reproduction steps and the only place we seem to encounter it is on a large and populated live server, this has been especially complex to debug and test.\u00a0\n\nSo far we have increased the channel limit, which allows for more sounds to play simultaneously, and we just made a system that resets the sound system on every loading screen. Hopefully this will help, but if not, we will continue trying what we can to solve it in future updates.\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/K5dpgdYnCCE](https://youtu.be/K5dpgdYnCCE)\n\n# Music Updates\n\nWe take part in working on the regular updates with the rest of the team, so we\u2019ve had our hands on every new weapon or skin that gets added with new sounds. But one of the inspiring elements for us is adding new music to the game.\u00a0\n\nOur latest work was for the franchise anniversary, but we have also tested the waters with various Sanctuary themes, including the updated Halloween and Auraximas versions you might have heard of in the last 6 months. Next, we are also trying to produce something nice for the November anniversary!\u00a0\n\nIn the coming period, we are working on getting our new soundtracks up on YouTube, with the first example being the PlanetSide Anniversary Remake:\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/8AefSwtisyI](https://youtu.be/8AefSwtisyI)\n\nOne additional area we are considering looking into is the NC music, also potentially tweaking some in game tracks. There is more to come in this area, and depending on your feedback on the matter, we have a few different paths ahead we might choose.\u00a0\n\n# A modern homage to the early days\u00a0\n\nOne of our philosophies on this project is to look back with respect while taking advantage of modern technology and techniques. One element we really like from the early days of PS2 audio was some of the unique sounds of weapon firing and vehicles for each faction.\u00a0\n\nWe have done some initial research, and in the future we hope to make certain elements sound more like they did several years ago.\u00a0\n\nThe modern aspect we want to make use of here is more complex with immersive acoustic technology and mixing techniques. Making busy combat scenarios sound a bit cleaner, while giving the player some more strategic elements for navigating the world through sounds.\u00a0\n\nThis will of course not be made in a hurry and is quite complex to dig into, so expect minor updates to begin while we monitor your response on the matter. Our goal is to improve your experience while maintaining that great PlanetSide feeling many of us enjoy.\u00a0\n\n# General improvements\u00a0\n\nBesides the points above, our day-to-day also consists of many general improvements. When working on these, we choose an area and try to work on it systematically. The first step is to break it down into categories, start testing and make a list of improvements containing both creative and technical fixes.\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/oY6h8FtOF34](https://youtu.be/oY6h8FtOF34)\n\nAfter doing this with weapons for a long time, submitting various updates you might have seen in patch notes, we have just started to move our focus over to vehicles.\n\n[https://youtu.be/IyOlo3Yg6Gs](https://youtu.be/IyOlo3Yg6Gs)\n\nIf you have any thoughts on areas that could benefit from projects like this, never hesitate to let us know on the forums - we try to account for as much data as possible when we make these decisions.\n\n# Conclusion and survey\u00a0\n\nAs we learn more, both from our own experiences and hearing what you, the players, write and how you react to our updates, we hope to be able to provide some great updates that will make your experience on Auraxis as good as possible. Below you can find the mentioned survey, and it would be very helpful to us if we could get your input submitted in this!\u00a0\n\nThe first part of this journey has been very exciting for us, and we thank you for continuing to be engaged in the game, both on the battlefield and with keeping the community active.\u00a0\n\n[PLANETSIDE 2 AUDIO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf95Vcoen1RSW2RH_0m4cQ0EibwpurY4w8FC_2RTVYt6YNUeg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\u00a0  \n  \n- PlanetSide 2 Team\n\nDevelopment Letter: [https://www.planetside2.com/news/audio-letter-jun-2024](https://www.planetside2.com/news/audio-letter-jun-2024)",

Everybody on the audio team deserves a blowjob if they actually fix this one, I sincerely don't care if the fix is just re-initializing the audio engine.",

I'm not talking about the 3 seconds clip that plays right now, play a lengthy portion of the theme of that faction, making it feel more epic.\n\nAnyway I'm happy with any news from devs at this point. But I hope they don't change the music we know and love, Vanu music is one of the reasons I still play the game. I'm all for fixing audio.",

This game has so much audio that it's easy for stuff to get lost in the shuffle and it can really impact how things feel to use (one such example being the automatic scout rifles that had weird desynchronized firing sounds and it made them frustrating to use as a result)\n\nI think the rationale for the MCG changes in particular make sense now that I can tell they were meant to sync up with the actual fired rounds."

            "This is what I meant. Half of these buildings are pointless because no one wants to babysit them just because there's a prowler chipping away at them from outside of render distance. I would never use a blast wall just because it will be mysteriously gone by the time I'm back from doing a cortium run.",
            "Blast walls work great as temporary cover for other construction, infantry, or small spaces. They have a very low profile and footprint and can be placed almost anywhere.\n\nThey work pretty well if you spam them while in an active combat zone. Either the attacker gets bored with shooting at walls and moves on, or that location is too hot to build and you need to re-assess.\n\nI often use them to act as a buffer for the vehicle gate soft points, around the silo as a last resort if the outer walls have fallen, or to plug wall gaps when you cant fully enclose due to terrain.\n\nTheyre also good at blocking infils sniping the silo terminal.",
            "Don't mistake my reply for defending what Wrel did to construction out of spite before ragequitting his job, but they removed base \"tick\" damage and building decay.\n\nI built up a base yesterday and it was fine, didn't need any repairs until they attacked it.\n\nBuildings only decay when they are placed beyond the range of the silo, if the silo runs out of nanites, or if the silo is destroyed. The Silo range is that big yellow circle you see when trying to place buildings, the ones from the bases which have silos are especially small in my opinion, easy to accidentally place a wall beyond it.\n\nI don't know what situation you encountered so I don't know what specifically was happening so maybe you found a bug or something. I have placed walls, and found them to be mysteriously \"decaying\", only to realize they were being shot by a Prowler from beyond my render range, so the round is invisisble, nor do I hear it, but it damages the walls. This was on Oshur."

The model hit box is is huge and it doesn't allow for the gunner to shoot when there are hills. The mag rider is also in weird spot IMO. It's unique in way that the vanguard and prowler are not. The Maggie has such a small hitbox when using hills and it can reach spots other tanks can't. It's also very good at fighting infantry since rockets are easier to dodge. Another thing is the ability to shoot while traveling on water at Oshur. Other tanks are sitting ducks moving slowly underwater.",

Only after capturing such points will it be possible to capture the base in the center with the help of infantry. It is possible to make such sectors without infantry bases at all.
