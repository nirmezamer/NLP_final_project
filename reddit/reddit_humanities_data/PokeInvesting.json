        "content": "Having visited most of the Pokemon Discords, the PokeInvesting Discord is one of the best by far. We have the friendliest and most respectful community. Our channels are more organized with members interacting who you'll actually recognize. It's not a sea of random people like other discords. Staying small is our key to remaining high quality. So here's 3 reasons to consider joining.\n\n1. Four Game Store Partners. - We have two vendors in Japan (ship worldwide) and two vendors in North America. They each have their own store channel to answer questions. One of our Jpn vendors only sells singles and can source anything you need. The whole idea is to be able to easily preorder, buy and ask questions with game stores from different regions with ease.\n2. Deals and Card Call Outs. - There are deals channels categorized by region, members post the deals they find online. The difference to other Discords is we don't allow discussion in these channels. So you can set your alerts, then find online deals and call outs from vigilant PokeInvestors on the lookout. We also monitor the largest game stores for restocks and drops, aside from having retail deals callouts on Discord from other sources.\n3. Space Is Limited. - Some Discords have thousands of members but then keeping up becomes difficult cause there's so many people. The PokeInvesting discord will never have more than a few hundred people if that, we will have to close off to keep a healthy state and good flow. The goal is to have a tight knit community of dedicated PokeInvestors who's voice matters and is heard, to avoid overcrowding we have to keep space limited.\n\nAt the end of the day it's an active community discussing every aspect of Pokemon finance. If you want more Pokemon investing, daily content it's a good place to be. There is paywall but it's a natural filter because people who hate it won't make it there, and those who do truly want to join do-so, it creates the positive energy our community has which is why it's in place.

            "An unbelievably cool community for sure. My favorite part of the community is the VAST knowledge possessed by the members. I've learned so much. About grading both vintage and modern, safe buying and selling, what products people are investing in daily, and just tons of other various on-the-spot knowledge like what packs come inside specific tins to talking about what's a good value for a certain sealed product at the moment - it's all so incredibly helpful.",
            "+1 for discord. Got me 11 SF preorders, skateboard preorder, a few rare cards from trade or members in other countries, and some good deals from lgs. Some of the bigger topics make it to here, but there are a ton of things that dont. There is 0 negativity on the server which is pretty rare from any other server that I have been on and everyone is willing to help out with any questions.",
            "Do I need to keep being subscribed each month to be in the discord? Or can I support for one month only but still be in the discord, I love the community but I don\u2019t have too much money on my hands.\n\nThank you in advance:)",
            "Are the partner stores actually providing products around MSRP? Honestly, if I can guarantee a few ETBS on release for close to MSRP, it would be worth the price. Even my LGS is starting to push prices up a pretty good amount.",
            "Can someone DM me the link to the discord?",
            "I\u2019ve really enjoyed being part of the discord and it has been a non stop conversation in my pocket. I\u2019ve been able to make some decent purchases from other members to help with my base collection. Its also nice to be able commiserate in real time with a bunch of people as PC blocks everyone. \n\nAppreciate all the effort and time people put into the group."

            "Between those two? Lugia, no question. \n\nThere are so many Charizards, but beyond that- Lugia is in the heart of the SWSH era poke boom that will be remembered fondly. I would value SWSH alts above pretty much any other modern cards.\n\nFill disclosure: I don\u2019t own either card.",

            "Whoever can bring a championship to their hometown first. Both seem pretty durable, so you want have to worry about any injury issues. Just hope they are surrounded by a good supporting cast.\n\nBoth are star players, but they just need to get over the hump. Going to be hard to make money if neither win a ring.",
            "As a casual fan who just re-entered, 151 is ridiculously popular. Feel the Zard will rise well as it's also part of a cool art set with the Charmander and Charmeleon.\n\nBoth will rise tho for sure.",
            "Yes",
            "Hopefully the Zard since I have that one lol",
            "I'd go with Lugia, but it all depends on how much 151 gets printed. Artwork is better, it stands out amongst the rest of the cards in the set, and Charizard is about 3x easier to pull (1/674 vs 1/225).\n\nI own both and pulled the Charizard myself. I personally wouldn't buy the Charizard when I can get the Venusaur, Zapdos, and Alakazam for the same price (which all look better imo).",
            "I would go for the Lugia. I have both cards, pulled 2x Charizard myself. It\u2019s so much easier to pull  compared to the Lugia so I think its value won\u2019t hold in the short to mid term. Especially when 151 reprints will be here."
