        "content": "Having visited most of the Pokemon Discords, the PokeInvesting Discord is one of the best by far. We have the friendliest and most respectful community. Our channels are more organized with members interacting who you'll actually recognize. It's not a sea of random people like other discords. Staying small is our key to remaining high quality. So here's 3 reasons to consider joining.\n\n1. Four Game Store Partners. - We have two vendors in Japan (ship worldwide) and two vendors in North America. They each have their own store channel to answer questions. One of our Jpn vendors only sells singles and can source anything you need. The whole idea is to be able to easily preorder, buy and ask questions with game stores from different regions with ease.\n2. Deals and Card Call Outs. - There are deals channels categorized by region, members post the deals they find online. The difference to other Discords is we don't allow discussion in these channels. So you can set your alerts, then find online deals and call outs from vigilant PokeInvestors on the lookout. We also monitor the largest game stores for restocks and drops, aside from having retail deals callouts on Discord from other sources.\n3. Space Is Limited. - Some Discords have thousands of members but then keeping up becomes difficult cause there's so many people. The PokeInvesting discord will never have more than a few hundred people if that, we will have to close off to keep a healthy state and good flow. The goal is to have a tight knit community of dedicated PokeInvestors who's voice matters and is heard, to avoid overcrowding we have to keep space limited.\n\nAt the end of the day it's an active community discussing every aspect of Pokemon finance. If you want more Pokemon investing, daily content it's a good place to be. There is paywall but it's a natural filter because people who hate it won't make it there, and those who do truly want to join do-so, it creates the positive energy our community has which is why it's in place.

            "Interested, signed up to try it out.",
            "An unbelievably cool community for sure. My favorite part of the community is the VAST knowledge possessed by the members. I've learned so much. About grading both vintage and modern, safe buying and selling, what products people are investing in daily, and just tons of other various on-the-spot knowledge like what packs come inside specific tins to talking about what's a good value for a certain sealed product at the moment - it's all so incredibly helpful.",
            "Are the partner stores actually providing products around MSRP? Honestly, if I can guarantee a few ETBS on release for close to MSRP, it would be worth the price. Even my LGS is starting to push prices up a pretty good amount.",
            "+1 to everything said so far. Ill add that its been incredibly fun to see what others are investing in, collecting, and finding locally as we all enjoy the hobby together.",
            "Im from Malaysia , can I really find good deals/trades considering the shipping and all that",
            "I think Im going to sign up. Im not a hard core investor like a lot of people (been leaning on some of my vintage cards), but there are a lot of 25th anniversary items that Im afraid of missing out on. \nThank you!",
            "Hey, I signed up a couple days ago and still haven't received the invite (I sent a massage through Patreon too). I'm sure I'm timed it wrong with the holiday weekend, but I'm hoping to get it soon. Thanks!",
            "Just signed up to check it out! Do I get an email with the invite or how does this work?",
            "Are spots still available? I would be interested in singing up :)"

They've seemingly been untouched for 25 years, but there are thousands of cards. What is the best way to approach selling them? Is it to bulk the cards? Have everything graded?"

            "As a casual fan who just re-entered, 151 is ridiculously popular. Feel the Zard will rise well as it's also part of a cool art set with the Charmander and Charmeleon.\n\nBoth will rise tho for sure.",
            "Ive never cared for this lugia. I think both cards will do well though",
            "I think Lugia. There are so many Zard cards out there and dont get me wrong the 151 is amazing. But there is only one Lugia we really all refer to.",
            "I'd go with Lugia, but it all depends on how much 151 gets printed. Artwork is better, it stands out amongst the rest of the cards in the set, and Charizard is about 3x easier to pull (1/674 vs 1/225).\n\nI own both and pulled the Charizard myself. I personally wouldn't buy the Charizard when I can get the Venusaur, Zapdos, and Alakazam for the same price (which all look better imo).",
            "I'm betting on myself that I would choose the wrong one",
            "I would lean more towards the Zard, scarlet and violet is still new and cheap the lugia has peaked for a little while.",
            "Art wise that Lugia slaps the charizard left and right every day of the week and twice on sunday.",
            "151 Charizard jusr because long term the Pokemon community always chooses Charizard",
            "I would go for the Lugia. I have both cards, pulled 2x Charizard myself. Its so much easier to pull  compared to the Lugia so I think its value wont hold in the short to mid term. Especially when 151 reprints will be here.",
            "I own both in English and the charizard in jpn. I think they both will be solid bets down the line as unique art designs. The lugia had a massive dip and has pulled back up, and I think it will continue to climb. Charizard will do the same in another year and a half. Long-term holds that are for sure solid!"
