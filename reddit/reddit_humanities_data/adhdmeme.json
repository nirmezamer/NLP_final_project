            "If you study suicide in an attempt to prevent it, you'll be thinking about the **subject** a lot. But your therapist isn't wondering about your latest fixation, they're asking if you are *considering* suicide.\n\nAny such considerations mean you are suffering from serious problems.",

            "Maybe I've just been extremely lucky, but I've genuinely been honest with previous therapists and even my current doctor about this exact thing and never had any issues.\n\nJust explained that I've had passive suicidal ideation since middle school, but never have had the urge to act upon those thoughts. Sometimes they are just fleeting, while others stemmed from trauma and telling my therapist about them helped us figure out more about my C-PTSD. I'd definitely say it largely depends on your therapist/doctor, as well as how long you've been going to them. It's something I didn't immediately open up about until I knew that it was safe to do so.",
            "Never say the S word in front of a medical professional unless you feel you're in real danger and that a bad experience in a psych ward is a better option than going home. They're not safe. They cooperate with cops and they're part of the carceral system. There's no way to be sure if the one you're talking to understands the difference between random thoughts about suicide, suicidal ideation, and actually making plan.\u00a0",
            "I am 56 years old. I am a dialysis patient for fourteen years. I have buried two children and been through other equally traumatic experiences. I have been suicidal so many times it's ridiculous.\n\n(Disclaimer: Absolutely none of this applies if you are actually suicidal. Tell your therapist/get a therapist/call the hotline.) \n\nI learned at the age of eight that mental health professionals are *never* to be trusted with that kind of information. It's one of the (many) reasons I will never list for a transplant. You do *not* give someone who has the power to upend your life/have you committed that kind of information.\n\nIt will also stay in your *electronic* medical record forever. Literally forever, it will follow you everywhere. And no matter what is medically wrong with you, it will hereafter form the basis of every diagnosis you get.\n\nThat is why I have never spoken to a mental health professional since I turned eighteen. And when regular doctors ask, they do not need to know and are not told. I've learned over a lifetime how to deal with and learn from my own shit. I have my husband to talk to. \n\nSorry, I know that will probably be a deeply unpopular opinion. But if they're just casual thoughts? Intrusive thoughts? You're not actually suicidal but you like contemplating death a lot? Absolutely fucking not.",
            "So one thing to keep in mind is some therapists and doctors are better at handling this than others.  A good therapist will be ok if when you are first meeting with them you ask about what they do and don\u2019t have to do or report based on how you are doing. Ethically, they should explain what would trigger them needing to report the situation or involve authorities (generally if they think you\u2019re at immediate risk of seriously harming yourself or others). \n\nHowever some are not good at handling it and they will somewhat panic if a person even mentions being suicidal.\n\nA lot of doctors (like, GP/primary care doctors especially) don\u2019t have extensive training in mental health. They are taught to do very basic evaluations or screenings so if you say you think about that to them they will likely be very concerned and might think you\u2019re a risk to yourself.\n\nGenerally, a good mental health provider is more likely to want to kind of get to know you and assess where you are at normally and what is a sign you are actually in danger. Unfortunately right now there\u2019s a shortage of providers in general, especially the good ones. \n\nJust sharing this because it is definitely true you want to be careful about disclosing stuff like that to avoid potentially harmful situations.  *And* there are some mental health professionals who are not trying to hospitalize everyone against their will (also laws around this vary from place to place as well significantly so that\u2019s another thing to keep in mind). \n\nBut to answer your original question, no, not everyone thinks about that all the time. But adhd does seem to have a higher incidence of having intrusive thoughts or thinking about stuff a lot that other people don\u2019t really. Also you can have adhd and be depressed",
            "They don\u2019t really mean \u201cthinking *about* suicide\u201d in a general sense, like having a thought concerning the subject of any sort. They mean considering doing it, but more people will say no if they ask that way \n  \nThey\u2019re supposed to ask follow-up questions if you say you think about it, not just assume what state you\u2019re in based on only that. Unfortunately a lot of people are not actually equipped to assess and definitely do assume based on very little"
