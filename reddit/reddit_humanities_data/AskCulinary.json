Outside of that go wild with it - brand recommendations, recipe requests, brainstorming dinner ideas - it's all allowed.",

            "Hello! I need help with a banana bread recipe. I had this ridiculously moist (more like wet) banana bread while I was on vacation on the opposite side of the US. I do not know the portions but I do know the ingredients. Can someone help me with portions? \n\nIngredients in order: BANANAS, FLOUR, BUTTER, SUGAR, PECANS, BROWN SUGAR, EGGS, CREAM, BUTTERMILK, MILK, BAKING SODA, VANILLA, SALT.",
            "Taste is obviously subjective, but parmesan cheese from those shakers has (to me at least) almost no flavor other than vaguely salty and umami.  Add that to a dish that's already sweet and umami heavy and you're basically just adding more \"tasty\" to a dish already designed to be tasty.",
            "Because you're adding salt and glutamates, which, within reason, make any savory dish taste better\n\nIf you'd have tried it with \"the good stuff\" it would be a very different final result",
            "If you've only got two pans and you don't want one to be a cast iron, than I agree with your two choices - a non-stick for eggs and other things that tend to stick easy and don't require high heat; a stainless steel pan for everything else.\n\nAs for brands, I love my tri-ply Cuisinart stainless steel pans.  They heat up really quick and maintain that heat and I like the handles on them better than the All-clads.  I've had my set for 10 years and occasionally hit them with barkeepers friend, but that's all the \"maintenance\" I've done to them (besides always hand washing them - no dishwasher for my pans).  For non-stick I don't have a brand to recommend.  I go to the discount store (TJ Maxx or Marshalls if your US based) and just buy a cheap $15 non-stick.  The coating on any non-stick pan will degrade and fall off after a year or two and you'll have to replace it so you might as well make it a cheap pan since you need to rebuy it in a couple of years anyway.",
            "I'm a professional so maybe biased to the side of simplicity lol. I use a cheap ass non-stick from the grocery store that I replace when it gets manky [British for gross] and a solid as hell 10in tri-ply All Clad stainless fry pan for browning things that was stolen from five jobs ago. A D3 8qt stock for almost everything- rice, ragu, rendang, risotto, you name the long/boring cook and thats all I bother with half the time. I've almost always used All-clads in pro kitchens because you can beat the tar ouf of them, use them in the oven, and the things last.\n\nI usually cook for two. And just about every pro cook I know uses a cheap ass non-stick at both work and home for eggs.  Though if I'm frying them in quantity, out comes the wok- which I've been known to use for lots of deep frying.",
            "As long as it's not a food safety question, it can be asked here.",
            "It would be easier to find banana bread recipes and make them and then adjust as needed to get the moisture/consistency you're looking for than it would be to try and come up with ratios for the listed ingredients.",
            "wraps! Melt cheese on them & wrap it...It doesn't have to be all about Tex-Mex, either. And you can layer them like a lasagna, too..",
            "carbon steel shill here to say 1 SS and 1 CS is all you need! I live off a 15 dollar Tramontina SS skillet and a 70 dollar Matfer Bourgeat CS skillet. Nonstick when given some occasional TLC, lighter than CI but heavy enough to give your arm a workout. Also good if you're concerned about PFAS and PFOAs in your nonstick (which is not something I care particularly much about)",

We are working on implementing these tools and would like your help (and patience) as we roll them out. For the first phase, we're going to use a tool to give you a gentle reminder that your post may be in violation of the rules before you even post it. This certainly won't catch everything and we expect a false positive every once in a while and that's where we need your help! If you find your posts keep getting a notice and you don't think it should, please [shoot us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskCulinary) containing as much info as you can about what went wrong so we know to adjust the rules. This is a learning process for everyone involved and we thank you for your patience.",

            "all the reasons mentioned above, it\u2019s to create a mass for more even cooking, also to create a prettier curry Ives kind of picture for the bird. In actuality, I found both with turkey chicken and duck be careful with duck, that the best way to evenly cook it is dispatch cock.",
            "So it cooks more evenly. Holding the legs and wings close to the breast means they all rise to temp at about the same time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If the legs and wings were allowed to splay out, the heat would penetrate them faster, and they\u2019d overcook by the time the breast is cooked through.\u00a0",
            "Thank you everyone for the info. Feel like I learned a lot here. My plan it to dry brine it with salt and then add minced thyme, oregano, and a little bit of white wine before I roast it? Any thoughts on that?",

You get discoloration and difficult-to-cook final product. \n\nThe shredded potatoes you see in the freezer section are shredded and blanched before freezing.

Is there any way to get a nice crispy skin using this recipe, or is this kind of recipe simply best suited to a piece without skin?\n\n---\n\n# Ingredients (4 servings):\n\n* 4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1-inch thick\n* Kosher salt\n* Freshly ground black pepper\n* 4 teaspoons maple syrup\n* 1 tablespoon white or brown miso\n* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar\n* 2 teaspoons soy sauce\n* 1 garlic clove, grated\n* 1 pound green beans, trimmed\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)\n* \u00bc teaspoon toasted sesame oil (optional)\n* \u00bc cup roughly chopped cilantro, both leaves and tender stems\n* 4 lime wedges, for serving\n* Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)\n* Cooked white rice, for serving (optional)\n\n# Preparation:\n\n1. Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Season the salmon fillets well with salt and pepper, and place them on a plate or in a large shallow bowl.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, miso, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and garlic. Pour the mixture on top of the salmon and gently massage the marinade all over the fish. Let marinate while the oven comes to temperature.\n3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss together the green beans with the olive oil, red-pepper flakes and sesame oil (if using) and season generously with salt and pepper. Lay the salmon fillets on the sheet pan skin side down and spread the green beans out surrounding the fillets.\n4. Arrange the salmon skin side down on the sheet pan and bake until the salmon is opaque and the green beans are cooked through, about 12 minutes. Right before serving, scatter with cilantro and a good squeeze of lime. Season with flaky sea salt and serve with rice, if desired.",

            "Put the marinade in a wide shallow bowl, roasting pan, tupperware, whatever. Place the salmon flesh side down in the marinade so the meat marinates but the skin stays dry above the marinade.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEither pre-heat your sheet pan in the oven so it\u2019s nice and hot and will crisp the skin when you place it on it. Or pan fry the salmon skin side down in a hot skillet for a minute and the \u00a0transfer into the oven or under a broiler to finish off. Either way will require less cooking time than starting with a cold pan per the original recipe.\u00a0",
            "Pre heat the sheet pan, with a little bit of oil in it. So when you put the fish on the pan you are putting it skin side down into hot oil on a hot pan",

            "There's no need to marinate the salmon with that recipe. Cook salmon normally and then baste/glaze the salmon with the sauce. Skin should come out crispy if you do it properly and it'll still have all the flavor from the marinade.",

            "Do you have to do anything to the skin to keep it from curling up into weird shape in the oven? I will usually take the skin off and crisp it on a pan but if I don\u2019t use a bacon press it shrivels and curls into a pretty unappealing shape."
