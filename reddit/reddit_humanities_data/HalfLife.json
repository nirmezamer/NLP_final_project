            "This is real good! Captures the look and feel, were it not specified as being one I would still be able to tell it was HECU.  \nWas a shame the original model ingame was never updated to the standard of the other human characters, it does look so primitive by comparison being obviously from an earlier time in development. Although a drawing, work like this gives me a good idea of how they could have been, white helmeted head and all!",
            "True, the original models did look goofy and not very human in comparison to the scientists and security guards. This is my head canon but I think its because Half Life 1 is from Freemans perspective. And from his point of view, the marines are the bad guys and are inhumane. So it would make sense why they look menacing and non human. Whereas in Opposing Force, we see the incident from Adrians point of view, where the marines are on his side. Thats why they look a lot more human in op4"
