            "You could add a `file:///` in as an ad list and Pi-hole would read the contents of the file. If the contents were not domains then the non-used lines were printed to the terminal to show a sample of what lines were not being used, exposing the contents of the file. Now any files being used for lists need to be world-readable so sensitive files can not be accessed.\n\nYou would need admin access to exploit this, you'd have to be able to add a local file as an adlist and then view the output from `gravity` but it was not a good situation. It also only really became an issue when we added in the process to display a sample of unused lines from list sources. \n\nPossible solution was to remove the display of unused lines but that would remove what some users found to be a good thing, the better solution was to just limit what can be seen by Pi-hole/FTL.",

            "It might help if you provide a network diagram including IPs and VLANs. There's not really any information in this post for anyone to give you good advice.\n\nI'm going to assume your PiHole is using a static IP of a network that isn't associated with a network in your UDMP. Your previous router probably used a different cidr range and your pihole is probably using a static IP on that range.\n\nIf I am correct, set the static to IP for your pihole to fall within range (but out of the DHCP range) of the network it should be part of. You can find this information in the unifi network application.",

When you open the querylog in the Pihole interface, do you see queries coming in from that device?\n\nYou should provide a lot more details of your setup. I would also suggest you read the documentation and the sticky FAQ thread here."
