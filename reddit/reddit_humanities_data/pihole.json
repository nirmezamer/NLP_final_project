Now any files being used for lists need to be world-readable so sensitive files can not be accessed.\n\nYou would need admin access to exploit this, you'd have to be able to add a local file as an adlist and then view the output from `gravity` but it was not a good situation. It also only really became an issue when we added in the process to display a sample of unused lines from list sources. \n\nPossible solution was to remove the display of unused lines but that would remove what some users found to be a good thing, the better solution was to just limit what can be seen by Pi-hole/FTL.",

Can I still use pi-hole as my DNS server across all the other APs and the main router or is it limited to just this one AP I have it hooked up to? \n\nMy limited knowledge on networking tells me that the answer is yes, but I needed to know for sure.

            "Either the PC or the router gets configured with the DNS server address, or both.  So, whoever uses the DNS server address uses the pihole and it's features.  The AP itself isn't handing out the DNS server, unless you specified that somewhere, but they don't usually do that.  APs just provide access to the network.  But the router will hand out the DNS server address, and you can still specify on the machine a DNS server to use or bu default it will generally use what is configured on the router.",
            "Can the devices on all of your networks ping the Pi-Hole and port 53 hasn't been blocked? If so, it should still work if the Pi-Hole is set as their DNS.",
            "So it would be more suitable if the pi-hole was hooked up to the house's main router right? The same router feeding all the other APs?",
            "Yes, though it shouldn't necessarily be a requirement.  Usually an AP provides a wifi layer to your home LAN, so it can be connected directly to the router, or through an access point and still receive DHCP from the same central router.\n\nWhat is important is that you configure the DNS server address that your router hands out to the rest of the client on your network to be the local address of the pihole.  That way everyone is directly to that machine.  If you do a wifi DNS server, whenever that wifi has issues all of your network might experience DNS issues.  So yes ideally using a wired connection is recommended."
