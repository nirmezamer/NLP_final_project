        "content": "Hi progresspics! We always strive to keep the subreddit as safe as possible, however, unsolicited/inappropriate Direct messages are always a possibility and unfortunately not one we can 100% prevent. While we hope people never receive anything that makes them uncomfortable, here are the steps you can take to report anyone who gets creepy in your DMs:\n\n1. report the user to us!\n\n \\-take screen shots of the messages, it doesn\u2019t have to be the whole conversation, just make sure we can see their user name, and the inappropriate part. \n\n\\-upload the screens to imgur and send us a link via modmail.\n\nall users reported to us for acting inappropriately will be permanently banned, however, this doesn\u2019t stop them from viewing the subreddit, or continuing to dm you, so..\n\n2) report the user directly to reddit at reddit.com/report\n\n3) block the user! Simply go onto their profile and click the three corner dots (mobile) or the \u201cmore options\u201d button (desktop) to find the option.\n\nTo prevent ALL DM's you can disable the DM and chat request options like so:\n\nMobile: settings > account settings > blocking and permissions.\n\nDesktop: User settings > chat and messaging.\n\nAs an aside, a note on image theft:\n\nit's been brought to our attention multiple times over the last month or so that a few content farm websites and social media accounts have been reposting pictures from here, while there isn't much that we can do to stop that we do want to remind everyone that it is a potential outcome to posting your images online, especially in areas with a large pool of specific content to farm from, while we do not allow users to promote their social media, including the use of watermark handles, you may watermark your posts with your REDDIT user name if you so wish.\n\nWe hope you all stay as safe as possible and know that any problems or questions can be sent into our modmail. Keep it clean, keep it safe, and read the rules before posting!",

            "Can we have a rule that before-after pics should go in the left-right order? The amount of pics in after-before order is too damn high.",
            "Hi mods! I wanted to ask about safety in another aspect. If someone drastically loses say 100lb in half a year and wasn't morbidly obese to begin with, would you still allow the post to be up despite how unhealthy it usually is? I don't mind reporting a post I found like that, or just ignoring it, depending on what rule you have about it.",

            "This may be random but as a minor (under 18) how can you show yourself looking stronger being fully clothed? I want to show my progress but I am afraid it will look the same or extremely similar being fully clothed unless I look completely different. Abs are hard to see under clothes, and biceps are still somewhat hard to see unless you wear a tanktop or something.",
            "Are we not allowed to post pics in a bikini if tagged NSFW? I\u2019ve tried multiple times to post (with proper subject line format) and not getting approved.",
            "Didn't see this! We'll discuss it, thanks for the suggestion!",
            ">this seems like a good idea",
            "The number of these posts does seem to be growing. I don't see why they wouldn't make this a rule.\n\nAs it is now, there is a possibility that someone has worked really hard and wants to show off their progress, then someone innocently asks \"have you put these the wrong way round\" which accidentally hurts their confidence. With smaller changes accompanied by different poses and lighting, it isn't always obvious."
