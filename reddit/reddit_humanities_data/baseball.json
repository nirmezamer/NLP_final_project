            "After a blow out win against the Yankees, the Orioles faced the same; but wow, how cool that they made it close in the end. A loss is a loss, and it\u2019s not what anyone wants\u2026but I love seeing the offense fight back. Now, with the devastating injuries and shaky outings of late, the pitching staff is going to need some work\u2026but at least the offense is hot.",

            "Adley 5 for 5, Gunnar trying to homer the team back into the game, a tiny victory for the Birds burning the good Abreu in a game with an eleven run lead. Likely Bryan Abreu won\u2019t pitch again in the series now. Birds won\u2019t have to face bad Abreu either, as he is at home in Florida earning his $30 million dollar salary for not playing.",
            "Oof\u2026those retained and injury payrolls always sting a bit. The Astros definitely had a good game against one of our best pitchers this season. I know their record doesn\u2019t show it yet, but the remain a threat. Adley, Gunnar, and Santander are definitely on fire lately. Let\u2019s see how the rest of the series unfolds. I swear I am always shaking my fist at Altuve when we face the Astros. Last game I was able to go to in Baltimore, he was also the one to make me groan in frustration. \ud83d\ude02"
