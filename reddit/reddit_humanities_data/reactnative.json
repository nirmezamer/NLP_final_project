            "It's Amazing and looks clean, never knew there's a library for this, so you are just stitching the images and making a time lapse? Did you manually add FPS and speed rate or is it provided by FFMPEG?",

The user can select a bunch of photos from their device (or generates selections from a given time range) and the app stitches them together into a slideshow.

I'm facing the same hurdle as you \u2013 the new Play Store policy requiring a closed beta test with\u00a0**20 testers for 14 days**. I built a simple app to solve a personal problem, but I think it could be helpful for others too. The problem? Launching it as a new dev (post-November 13th, 2023) requires this test, and paid services seem expensive or unreliable, with some even using automated testing that might violate Google's policy.\n\nHere's my idea: a community of developers who can\u00a0**test each other's apps**! This would not only fulfill the 20-tester requirement but also provide valuable feedback from developers who understand our struggles.\n\n**Does this sound good?**\n\n**I have identified, a community like this already exists!**\u00a0Check out\u00a0[Android Closed Testing Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JGqRGOO48ka69JkRrmv8d3).\n\nPlease let me know if you find it helpful.\n\nTogether, we can help each other with this new policy and launch our apps to the playstore.",
