            "I read somewhere that the west sold the idea that the Sovs wanted to be in Paris next in order to preserve the drive to spend on Military. The Sovs had their eyes on Nice slices of Europe but were probably as tired of the war as the British and French were. The hawks in the west probably had an old \u2018chance to destroy the bolsheviks\u2019 drive but practically what would you do with a Russia you had  just dropped a nuke on? Occupy it?

            "Basically beginning in 1948 President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Secretary of Defense Forrestal deliberately deceived Congress and the public that the Soviets were about to immediately start world war 3 in order to get approval for the Marshall plan, initiate a massive military buildup to jump start the economy before the 1948 election, and to save the aircraft industry. In doing so they created the modern military-industrial complex. They did this despite almost all the intelligence reports they got saying that the Soviets were our of resources and had too many internal problems to start WW3. They terrified the public, demonized former allies like Henry Wallace and successfully turned public opinion strongly towards financing the military-industrial complex.\n\nA good book on the topic is *Harry S. Truman and the War Scare of 1948: A Successful Campaign to Deceive the Nation*",
            "No. I don\u2019t think that at any time between 1945 and the fall of Communism that the USSR and its slave states of Eastern Europe could have won a war of conquest in Western Europe. An attack would have provoked a response from all of the NATO countries led by the USA and Britain, who actually had something of a fighting force back then. France, being France, might have tried to stay out of it. Germany was divided and West Germany was not strong at all. The Eastern Bloc satellite states appeared to be pretty strong, but how loyal would they be to the USSR, whom a number of them secretly hated? It would have been carnage\u2014 and perhaps a near thing, but the West would have prevailed.",
            "One of the think I have heard about why the allies did not want to go war with the Soviets, was also because the USSR could have invaded Iran, whose oil was key to the war effort. I think it is often downlooked upon, but a war with the USSR would not have happen just in Europe, but throughout the world. Many communist party members were still armed and organise in country like France and Italy. Those country would probably have been through a civil war if the allies attacked the ussr.",

            "Do you mean family farmers growing food (instead of cash crops) and not employing slaves?  It varied from one area to the next.  In areas with cash crop plantations, they had an interdependent relation with plantations.  They sold food to the plantation, and the plantation would often hire people from local farm families to work on the plantation, e.g. as slave drivers.  They could do pretty well, so long as they stayed in the good graces of the plantation owner.  \n\nFarmers in places such as northern MS and the Appalachians were not part of the plantation economy, and they were not eager to secede from the Union.  This helps to explain counterrevolutionaries such as Newt Knight, and WV's secession from VA.  I am not certain, but I think that economically, they were not as prosperous as farmers in the plantation regions, or their counterparts in the north.",
            "Yes and no. The people in mind, one of my ancestors, grew a cash crop, but did not own any slaves. I've checked census records thoroughly, and can find no evidence my ancestor profited off of any slave labor. He still grew mass amounts of cotton and corn, and fathered 10 children, who I presume helped on the farm. Even still, he fought the full three years under the confederacy. Would you consider him a planter or no? He definitely didnt own any slaves, i know that much.",
            "Well, he certainly wouldn't be considered part of the planter class.  He may not have owned slaves, but is it possible that he employed slave labor?  Plantations sometimes leased out their slaves.  I am certainly not trying to badmouth your ancestor, but I would need to know more before forming an opinion about the matter.",
            "well that is entirely possible, although i have no proof of or against it. Guess i can only hope he didn't. He had about a 1000 acres, so it is more than possible he still employed slave labor."

            "Heavily deppendent on mission and equipment and I know that isn't a really good answer but a cartridge box for the 1861 springfield musket could carry up to 40 cartridges, sometimes soldiers would have less ammo on them because of shortages, i've seen raiders and skirmishers in photos with multiple cartridge boxes. A soldier in WW2 for the garand usually could carry 80 rounds in his kit but you see tons of photos of guys carrying multiple bandoleers including adding more loose clips to their slings and uniforms. Even today with the m4a1 its not uncommon for guys to carry more ammo deppending on what they are doing. \n\nTL;DR it deppends a lot on mission and resources. But as ammo gets more compact and smaller the ammount has increased.",
            "Thanks for the response! I put the M16/M4 as a frame of reference as I'm actively serving U.S. military, I was mainly curious about the older firearms. I didn't know they had a 40 round cartridge box - how much ammo could you possibly go through in an engagement with muskets that take 15-20 seconds to reload?",

Running out of ammo didn't take them all day, it took them *two hours*.",
            "Deppends tbh as much as you probably hate that answer. Prolonged firefights of course burnt through ammo slowly while assaults and defending against them burnt through them quicker. Some guys never even got to fire shots off in some battles because there was little or no fighting where they were in the field and instead chose to conserve ammo. So for a pitched battle 15-30 sounds about right but again could be more, Joshua Chamberland's men famously ran out of ammo fighting on Little Roundtop at Gettysburg after fighting for a day but repulsed Confederate troops with a bayonete charge."
