            "The British conducted a study in May 1945 to see the feasibility of attacking the Soviets. British and American forces would have been severely outnumbered. The study estimated that Anglo-American forces could get about 80-100 divisions together, while the Soviets had over 200 available to fight. The Soviets also had more tanks, and more aircraft (although of a lesser quality). They were a substantial threat, to say the least. \n\nHowever, the Soviets absolutely could not have beaten the other Allied forces immediately post WW2. America had atomic weapons, and were the only country on Earth that had them for ~4 years. They could have decimated any country just based on that alone. But, like you pointed out, the Soviets were also reliant on Lend-Lease for a lot of vital resources. If you cut that supply off, they\u2019re weakened substantially. \n\nI think people get hung up on trying to argue who was the best or the most powerful during WW2. Each major military had strengths and weaknesses. And the big 3 Allied nations all contributed in ways that were essential and unique to their capabilities. No single Allied nation or combination of two could have categorically defeated the Nazis. It was a cumulative effort.",
            "In no small part, because for a long time it was useful propaganda for a lot of parties.\u00a0\n\nIt was useful for NATO to present the Soviet Union/Red army as a vast hode that was just waiting to crash down on Europe to help solidify the alliance.\u00a0\n\nIt was useful for the Soviets as it presented them as the grand army emerging out of WW2 after defeating the Nazi\u2019s.\u00a0\n\nIt was useful for ex-German officers (many who would be writing memoirs and looking for employment post war) to present the Red army as this massive force of nature that no one could have stood against. It didn\u2019t matter that they were \u201cmilitary geniuses\u201d (in their own opinion/their marketing), no one could have stood before those numbers.\u00a0\n\nThis held true for pretty much the whole cold war which helped cement it into pop history, and after the cold war there were a few years of more open investigation and the Soviet/Russian archives were open for research, but with the rise of the modern Russian state the archives are closed again, and and the ideas have been pretty well set into pop history, leaving more modern historians with the hard work of trying to establish a more clear view of history without access to the import source information (which is sitting somewhere untouched in a Russian archive from fear of discrediting the russian armed forces, which is a jailable offence).",
            "The whole thing of \u201cinfinite Soviet manpower\u201c is a myth. They lost so many soldiers in 1941 and 1942, and they continued to throughout the war. If you watch some of the specials on the Discovery Channel or history channel, they interview Russians who were pulled into the Soviet army when they were 15 or 16 in late 1942 and fought at Stalingrad.  That is also about the time that they begin to seriously draft women.   \n\nAmerican officers who flew to Kharkov in the summer of 43 mentioned how the airbase was guarded by 14-year-old girls with PPSK.  And driving around that region, they saw no one except for children and people with gray hair. Yes, the summer of 1943.   \n\nAnd, as many Soviet leaders later quietly admitted, without lend lease they don\u2019t make it.",

Even though Stalin basically begged for the opening of the Western front.\n\n He even refused  to start Operatoon Bagration until **three weeks after** D-Day..",
            "Because both the Soviets allies and former axis all hyped up the red army as this unstoppable force.\n\n When in reality by 1945 had lend lease been cut off and war between the Soviets and allies began, although the Soviets would have initial success. Their logistical situation would begin deteriorating rapidly and with them already having severe man power issues they would find it very hard to replace manpower and equipment lost in these early offensives especially as most of eastern Europe still hated them and their own industrial situation was extraordinarily poor when compared to the US so unless the Soviet Union manage to completely push the allies out of Europe and Asia within the first year or two of the war. They\u2019d begin to collapse under pressure as the numbers advantage began to faulter, and as the US simply outproduced the Soviet and destroyed, any possible industry they could salvage from Eastern Europe and as more and more pressure built on the Soviets It\u2019s highly likely they\u2019d begin to collapse, especially as many parts of their army would begin to surrender as supplys runs out and as allies bomb every vehicle in range and begin to slowly, but surely push the red Army back.  And the further back the red army goes the stronger, the allies get in the weaker the Soviets become as they\u2019re unable to replace their losses and equipment or manpower and as occupied territories, continue to resist Soviet occupation and support the allies as they enter their regions.",

People in the Middle Ages would be used to almost exclusively interact with people they know, at least outside of the bigger cities.

On the plus side, no plague, and infectious diseases weren\u2019t very common in the small groups of the time. \n\nSo based on disease risks, I would go with Stone Age living. None of my skills would be useful in any place, so not dying of plague would be the better option.",
            "The whole answer I think here comes down to high variance, higher life expectancy (middle ages) or low variance, low life expectancy (Paleolithic). The low variance is mostly a function of things killing people quickly. \n\nIn the Paleolithic, you got to 20-25 as an average life expectancy. You're between 33-42 by 1500, which doesn't seem like much but is basically a 33% increase (I don't need to do to the math on low and high end of range, you get the point), which is a huge deal. Especially since many of those changes happened related to childbirth - dropping dread and/or having an infant die was catastrophic at one point, and in most countries today happens infrequently (obviously, it can happen). \n\nBut disease and plague happen much easier in concentrated societies, which 1500 certainly was. The likelihood an event that even a modern, intelligent, risk-avoiding human could avoid something like the plague is near zero, but I can certainly say when it's a dumb idea to chase a lion. \ud83e\udd37 The problems to solve in the Paleolithic are simple, if unpleasant, but confined to smaller groups of people. The problems of 1500 are societal in nature, and not as directly under your control."
