        "content": "Hello /r/greysanatomy!\n\nAs the stewards of this subreddit, we want to take a moment to remind all users of the importance of using the report button responsibly and appropriately. Recently, we've noticed an increase in reports for posts and comments that do not violate either subreddit-specific or site-wide rules. This misuse of the report button disrupts the moderation process and diverts our attention from addressing genuine issues that require our immediate attention.\n\n***\n\n**Using the Report Button:**\n\nThe report button is an essential tool for maintaining the quality and integrity of our community. If you come across content that violates subreddit rules or goes against the Reddit guidelines, please don't hesitate to report it. Our team of moderators will carefully review all reports and take appropriate action when necessary. Remember, reports are anonymous, so don't be afraid to speak up when you encounter genuine problems.\n\n***\n\n**The Report Button is Not a \"Disagree\" Button:**\n\nIt's important to emphasize that the report button should not be used as a \"disagree\" button. Just because you may disagree with someone's opinion or find a post you don't particularly like, it doesn't automatically qualify as a reportable offense. The report button is meant to address content that is genuinely in violation of the rules, such as harassment, spam, or explicit content.\n\n***\n\n**What if something doesn't break the rules but I'm tired of seeing it or too much of it and I think it's spam?**\n\nWe understand that not every post or comment will resonate with everyone. Reddit is a platform that relies on community voting to determine what content is popular and what isn't. If you come across something that you find uninteresting, repetitive, or spam-like, please use the upvote and downvote buttons accordingly. This system allows the community to have a voice in shaping the content they want to see more or less of.\n\n***\n\n**False Reports and Consequences:**\n\nMaking false reports not only clutters the moderation queue but also creates unnecessary work for our team. This behavior is against Reddit's site-wide rules and can lead to serious consequences for the offending user. We want to foster a positive and welcoming environment for everyone, and that starts with using the report button responsibly.\n\nWe encourage everyone to engage in respectful discussions, share valuable content, and participate in the voting process to influence what gets more visibility in our subreddit.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community and helping us maintain a healthy environment for all members. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to the moderation team.\n\n***\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Grey's Anatomy Moderation Team",

            "She doesn't necessarily have to have alzheimer's, but an ending that would make sense is that later in life she goes on to write a book about becoming a surgeon and how the experiences she had are what led her to become the \"great Meredith Grey.\" Final scene could be her at a book reading, finishing her last monologue, big applause, and then last shot is of her closing the book titled \"Grey's Anatomy\"\n\n(as for the other character voice-overs, maybe Meredith let them have some of their own chapters lol)",

            "I think it\u2019d be such a disservice to the character to have the whole show framed around her getting Alzheimer\u2019s and forgetting people. \n\nAnd honestly with the breakthrough she just made on Alzheimer\u2019s research in season 20, I really don\u2019t see the show going in that direction.",
            "No absolutely not. Meredith the woman who survived quite literally everything deserves a way better ending than ending up in a nursing home just like her mom. It would feel so cheap to bring it full circle in that specific way.",
            "I don\u2019t understand why anyone wants Meredith to end up like Ellis. The whole point was Meredith working so hard not to turn into her mother. What a depressing way to end a show. \n\nHow about she wrote the journals out of fear of getting Alzheimers but instead their a record of her journey to curing it. Maybe it\u2019s part of a lecture she\u2019s giving. But I will be really pissed if the show ends on such a downer."

            "> When Shepard, 49, noted the actor was \u201cstruggling\u201d with drug and alcohol addiction at that point, Dane responded, \u201cI was struggling. They didn't let me go because of that, although it definitely didn't help.\"\n\n> \"I was starting to become \u2014 as most of these actors who have spent significant time on the show \u2014 you start to become very expensive for the network,\" he claimed. \"And the network knows that the show is going to do what it's going to do irrespective of who they keep on it\u2014as long as they have their Grey they were fine.\"\n\n> Dane went on to praise Rhimes\u2019 handling of the situation, saying, \"She protected us fiercely. She protected us publicly, she protected us privately... I love Shonda Rhimes and she protected me but I was probably fired. It wasn't ceremoniously like, 'You're fired,' it was just like, 'You're not coming back.'\"",
            "I really wish they\u2019d picked ways to fire people without always killing them. With the show having gone this long, they\u2019ve built so much history that they can\u2019t even use because they killed so many characters. Imagine if they\u2019d just let George go into the army. People change jobs all the time.",
            "IMHO, letting him go was a mistake. He really helped with the comedic moments on the show. He had very believable banter with Derrick. You could really see the non sexual chemistry they had not to mention the dynamic with Callie. I'd give them 10 Maggie's to get back Mark and Lexie. I get that the man whore stuff doesn't play as well to younger audiences but stuff was sadly like that back then. Nothing they showed or said at that day and age was unrealistic as far as him being so gross now.",
            "why did they photoshop mark\u2019s hair to look ginger like owen\u2019s in that picture?",
            "Honestly, his character just doesn\u2019t survive after Lexies death. Like I can\u2019t imagine a version of Greys where Mark ever really recovers from that. Even though they had broken up, he clearly still loved her (I mean he literally says it to his gf lol) so he would have been forever changed by watching her die",
            "Well I appreciate him taking responsibility for his own mistakes it's unfortunate that he is one of the few all time great characters with a definitive not moving back exit obviously because his character died. Sucks I'd love to see more Sloan he and Lexie were a welcome surprise during season 17.",
            "Seeing Mark go on with Lexie being dead would've been more painful",
            "I hate that we were robbed of seeing where the characters could have gone for the sake of drama.",
