        "content": "So, as the BHJ community has been somewhat rehealing itself after the GREAT COMMUNIST TAKEOVER i've decided to ask Kirbizia about partnering the BHJ community with the OkBR discord server, this is due to the past BHJ servers not really performing well when it came to having a lot of members, they would die and nothing would ever happen! So now instead what will happen is BHJ, just like the shared minecraft server will gain its own share within the OkBR discord server, with a subreddit stream channel, subreddit discussion channel, etc.  \n\n\nCurrently there's a pretty fine and dandy VALENTINE'S DAY seasonal event, you can grind coins and gain lots of cool rewards, get a custom flair, custom vanity roles, and even BAN users!!! (WHAT??!?!)  \nThus, what are you waiting for...  \n[**https://discord.gg/4avADksSYU**](https://discord.gg/4avADksSYU) **(The server is already fairly active with around 2,000 users, come join us and talk talk TALK!!!!!!**  \n\n\n[https://steamcommunity.com/groups/okbrgroup](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/okbrgroup) Don't forget to also join the shared steam group too if you want! (And our friends' TF2 server.) \"Nailgun World\" which tries to make the game feel like its 2007 again!  \n\n\nAll BHJ users will be able to get a pat on their head and maybe a little cool role for being BHJ users? (Maybe haha)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

        "content": "It seems I don't formally have permissions to edit the rules in the side bar (that I am aware of) so I'm going to describe clarifications on the rules implemented.\n\nBased on the recent survey conducted WokelyCorrect will be banned. There was consideration for leaving other edits of bigoted sources, but the posts this past week have not put this in a good light: discriminatory caricatures of minorities cannot be changed through text alone. Posts that include discriminatory imagery will be removed, effective after this post.\n\n- Rule 1: No antimemes. When the text is changed to describe solely what is in the image. Does not apply when the image was reinterpreted and the items described are not what was originally represented by the source image.\n\n- Rule 2: No Reposts. Self explanatory, do not repost others' BHJ from this sub. If obtained outside this sub use the \"Found\" flair, and source where you found it preferably via link.\n\n- Rule 3: Edit text, not the base image. Some of you are really pushing the limits of this rule with musical notes, Jojo menacing effect, adding rectangles/circles and calling them dashes and periods, etc. If the text is functioning as text it is text, if it is representing imagery (I's and L as loss, musical notes not on a staff, blushes on cheeks) it is not text. Small image edits are okay but if your joke/new context does not work without the edit it breaks the rule. Effective only to posts after this one due to lack of clarity in the rules.\n\n- Rule 4: No title based jokes. This also applies to screenshots where the title, comments, or caption (outside of image like Reddit captions) contain the joke.\n\n- Rule 5: Random. Refers to when the edited text has nothing to do with the base image. Putting a generic joke, generic song lyrics, game/literature/movie reference or anything otherwise completely unrelated to the image is against this rule. Again, effective only to new posts due to lack of clarity.\n\n- Rule 6: On-topic. Posts should consist of edited text of a base image (that is not primarily text like a Twitter/4Chan post etc) that changes the meaning and/or context of the source material. For discussions of the state of the sub use the \"Meta\" flair.\n\n- Rule 7: Do not advertise. Applies for both posts and comments.\n\nSome more rules are in effect but are not currently listed in the sidebar:\n\n- No joke other than a reference to BHJ: a screenshot or post that says only says something to the effect of \"Bone Hurting\", \"off\", \"Eh?\" \"HA!\" or \"Hehe\". Most edited panels would fall under Rule 5, this primarily applies to screenshots.\n\n- Self Watermarked: an edit to a panel does not give you rights to the art. Exception is juicing one's own comic/artwork and leaving the existing watermark intact.\n\n- Banned Source: Stonetoss and WokelyCorrect are banned sources.\n\nSome common reports are technically not rules but can be added depending on public opinion:\n\n- linking or adding source image: it is common courtesy to source the artist. If you do not feel comfortable sourcing the artist due to the artist's \"opinions\" it may be a better idea to juice a different image. When people are asking words that begin with O on your post they are asking for the source material.\n\n- Speed of Lobsters: if the meaning is changed solely through removing portions of the existing text it may be better suited for r/SpeedOfLobsters.\n\nEdit: new rules should now be up. Let me know if they're not displaying correctly\n\n\n",
