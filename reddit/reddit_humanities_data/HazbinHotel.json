            "But wouldnt they be able to die of bloodloss if someone damaged them enough? Ik they cant kill them without angelic steel but are we sure about that? If they can rip their arm off shurely they could rip all their limbs off to a point of death by bloodloss or rip their heads off right?"

            "Depends like we have seen Valentino be horrible to angel dust and by extension probably every other sinner he has working in his porn studio, on the other hand alastor has committed atrocities against the previous overlords and tortured them for years on end and has husk terrified when he is angry so I'd say they are both terrible people but in completely different ways",
            "Alright well one\u2019s a manipulative rapist\u2026 probably worse\n\nAnd the other is a manipulative serial killer *and* a cannibal\u2026\n\nYeah they both aren\u2019t very nice",

            "Equally bad for different reasons",
            "From the little info we have... Val\n\n\nAlastor has alledgedly tortured other overlords for power. I say alledgedly because it could be a folk tale to drum up fear of him.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, vivz has stated and released side material showing him to have a sort of base code. I don't like to call it a moral code, but yes.\u00a0\n\n\nSo it's possible that all the overlords alastor tortured were...very bad people.\u00a0\n\n\nNow for the people under him: Alastor treats Niffty like a daughter, and he was pretty fine with husk most times\u00a0\n\n\nHusk outright said to folks, with alastor nearby he was forced to be there and alastor did nothing. He even offered husk a bribe to work even though he could've just threatened him\n\n\nHe still threatened husk with grievous harm though. That's not okay. But it wasn't at random, but when threatened. Not that that makes it okay... but it's better than Val\n\n\nVal is shown to be worse to be people overall. He killed an innocent person to blow off steam, he sexualy and physical abuses people for the fun of it and on the regular\n\n\nSo, underling wise: you have a guy that will sexually and physically abuse you at any moment, and a lot...versus a guy that won't do anything to you as long as you don't try threatening him\n\n\nThetes no contest here: Alastor is the better boss. Not a good one, but certainly the better choice between him and Val\n\n\nHowever, non boss wise. Alastor is more dangerous as an enemy than Val",
            "I mean, they are different kinds of bad",
            "both are bad in different ways,do not compare a serial killer to a rapist",
