        "content": "I started this sub 10 months ago in order to create a space to make fun of, criticize (yes that includes shitposts), and generate legitimate discussion regarding r/AmITheAsshole. We criticize their censorship on their sub, and mod decisions we disagree with. That however DOES NOT mean we will censor them or those that agree with their mod team in return (though we fully recognize that they would likely ban a user criticizing them on an AITA post). I stand for free speech in its entirety, and will protect it just as vehemently on this sub for those that disagree with the views of the majority here, as the views of the minority (regardless of their status on this sub or any others).\n\n\nThe reason I'm stating this is because a member of our mod team made a decision that mirrored censorship, and for reasons that I felt were misguided. Yes their action was directed at a moderator on r/AmITheAsshole commenting on here, but their views/comments are welcome here so long as they do not violate sitewide rules. I tend to tread *very* lightly on moderation here. I prefer to allow the system of downvotes and upvotes to allow users to decide which posts/comments the majority agrees should be on top. Yes, that allows shitposts to sometimes consume the feed but it's your choice to decide, not mine, nor anyone else's on the mod team. If a mod from AITA says something stupid on this sub, downvote them and call them out on their bull shit, I encourage it. But neither me nor any member of this moderation team should take any removal, muting, or banning action against them unless they violate the subreddit's rules or sitewide rules. \n\n\nOn top of this I would also like to state that I will *never* allow the moderation team of r/AmITheAsshole to have any real influence or power over this sub. We are completely independent of them, and I will not allow them to censor or silence us in any way. Though they have reached out many times and voiced their opinion on our sub and their disdain for it, asking us to make changes on occasion that would compromise what this sub is, I have never, and will never, give in. \n\n\nOn top of this, I would like to remind everyone that there should be no brigading/trolling on r/AmITheAsshole. So far from what I can tell we've done an AMAZING job so far and have not had ANY complaints from r/AmITheAsshole moderation team (which to me, sounds pretty good). But I also want to remind that it means:\n\n\n**Don't comment or post on an r/AmITheAsshole post that is crossposted here**\n\n\n**Don't post/comment criticisms of their sub/moderation team on their sub, keep it to this one** (if you're subscribed here that is, if you're a passerby that happens to find this you're not my problem lmao)\n\n\nAnd as always... **Follow reddiquette**\n\n\nAnd so long as we do this and keep it up we won't have to worry about anything or any sort of retaliation against this sub. Again though, y'all have done an AMAZING job of behaving and following the rules, and this isn't a warning to any of y'all in any way (this is more geared towards new subscribers). \n\n\n***ALSO I KNOW I'M REALLY REALLY LATE AND I DIDN'T MAKE A POST, BUT HAPPY 10, NOW 11K!!!!***",

Our mods are North America based so we'll take time zones into account.\n\nBut what does \"of quality\" mean? It means that your shitposts must now reflect an AITA post, or a grouping of them, and the AITA post(s) must be linked **at the bottom of the shitpost.** If no AITA source is provided, **your post will be removed.** Shitposts must have substance to them too. They can not be general one-liners that cover the tropes of AITA for some karma grab.\n\nHere is a refresher of rules of the sub:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/yy0b7h/aita\\_for\\_explaining\\_some\\_rule\\_clarifications/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/yy0b7h/aita_for_explaining_some_rule_clarifications/)\n\nReport all shitposts you see outside of weekend hours so we can remove them.\n\nThanks,\n\nFluffinn (20F, 28G, *hot*)",
