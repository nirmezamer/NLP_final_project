        "content": "I started this sub 10 months ago in order to create a space to make fun of, criticize (yes that includes shitposts), and generate legitimate discussion regarding r/AmITheAsshole. We criticize their censorship on their sub, and mod decisions we disagree with. That however DOES NOT mean we will censor them or those that agree with their mod team in return (though we fully recognize that they would likely ban a user criticizing them on an AITA post). I stand for free speech in its entirety, and will protect it just as vehemently on this sub for those that disagree with the views of the majority here, as the views of the minority (regardless of their status on this sub or any others).\n\n\nThe reason I'm stating this is because a member of our mod team made a decision that mirrored censorship, and for reasons that I felt were misguided. Yes their action was directed at a moderator on r/AmITheAsshole commenting on here, but their views/comments are welcome here so long as they do not violate sitewide rules. I tend to tread *very* lightly on moderation here. I prefer to allow the system of downvotes and upvotes to allow users to decide which posts/comments the majority agrees should be on top. Yes, that allows shitposts to sometimes consume the feed but it's your choice to decide, not mine, nor anyone else's on the mod team. If a mod from AITA says something stupid on this sub, downvote them and call them out on their bull shit, I encourage it. But neither me nor any member of this moderation team should take any removal, muting, or banning action against them unless they violate the subreddit's rules or sitewide rules. \n\n\nOn top of this I would also like to state that I will *never* allow the moderation team of r/AmITheAsshole to have any real influence or power over this sub. We are completely independent of them, and I will not allow them to censor or silence us in any way. Though they have reached out many times and voiced their opinion on our sub and their disdain for it, asking us to make changes on occasion that would compromise what this sub is, I have never, and will never, give in. \n\n\nOn top of this, I would like to remind everyone that there should be no brigading/trolling on r/AmITheAsshole. So far from what I can tell we've done an AMAZING job so far and have not had ANY complaints from r/AmITheAsshole moderation team (which to me, sounds pretty good). But I also want to remind that it means:\n\n\n**Don't comment or post on an r/AmITheAsshole post that is crossposted here**\n\n\n**Don't post/comment criticisms of their sub/moderation team on their sub, keep it to this one** (if you're subscribed here that is, if you're a passerby that happens to find this you're not my problem lmao)\n\n\nAnd as always... **Follow reddiquette**\n\n\nAnd so long as we do this and keep it up we won't have to worry about anything or any sort of retaliation against this sub. Again though, y'all have done an AMAZING job of behaving and following the rules, and this isn't a warning to any of y'all in any way (this is more geared towards new subscribers). \n\n\n***ALSO I KNOW I'M REALLY REALLY LATE AND I DIDN'T MAKE A POST, BUT HAPPY 10, NOW 11K!!!!***",

            "\n*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**I accidentally got my sister pregnant and we aren\u2019t telling anyone to make her rich husband believe it\u2019s his.**\n\nMy sister and I grew up very close. We are close in age (I\u2019m 22 and she\u2019s 25), so we got to experience a lot of life things around the same time. Because of that, we became best friends super early on. \n\nGrowing up, I was absolutely never attracted to her in any sort of way. I also believe it\u2019s worth stating that I have never had any sort of brother/sister fetish or any sort of incest fetish either. And after everything that\u2019s happen, I still don\u2019t.  \n\nThree years ago, I started college and moved to a different state. A few weeks after, my sister\u2019s long time boyfriend asked her to marry him. It\u2019s the first time I was ever really super far away from my family and it bothered me really badly. I got super bad depression and became really homesick. Around 7 months later, I got to fly back home and see my family for my sisters wedding day. It was one of the biggest days of my life seeing my best friend marry the man of her dreams. \n\nNow, a tiny bit of backstory here...Her husband\u2019s dad is insanely wealthy. A really big name in the pharmaceutical business. He not only paid 100% for their huge wedding but also bought them a gorgeous house in full (apparently with a check) as a wedding gift from the dad and mom. \n\nI went back to college and life back home went on normally. I was still really depressed and homesick but decided to do what I had to do and just push on. I was able to visit back home a few more times because of holidays. The one time I went back home other than for a holiday, was a surprise party for my parents 30th anniversary. Usually when I went home, I would get picked up at the airport by my dad and I would stay at their house in a spare bedroom. But because this was a big secret, my sister picked me up and I was staying at her house for the five days I was in town. \n\nThe party was great and everything went wonderful. There was a lot of alcohol there and I definitely drank my fair share. The party ended around 10pm. My sister and I were both pretty drunk and took a Uber back to her house about 15 minutes away. Her husband works long hours and was unable to take off work this day and by the time we got home he was already asleep in their bedroom. We decided to go into the spare bedroom that I was sleeping in just to catch up and talk. \n\nWe chatted for around an hour and a half. Just talking about life and shit. We were both pretty drunk at this point and it was getting pretty late. I had to pee and told her I would be right back. So I got up and walked into the bathroom attached to the bedroom I was staying in and started to pee. Didn\u2019t think anything of it. When I walked back into the room, my sister was laughing. I asked her what was so funny when she admitted, \u2018I somehow managed to go 22 years without seeing your dick!\u2019 I was super confused and sort of embarrassed. I asked her what she was talking about. She told me that she could see into the bathroom mirror which reflected where I was standing to pee. \u2018Well was it worth the wait?\u2019 I said drunkenly laughing with her. Just like that the mood of the room completely changed. It was like someone flipped a switch. We kept bantering back and forth for a few minutes when out of absolutely nowhere I started kissing her on the lips pretty aggressively. I immediately realized what I was doing and started to pull away when she grabbed onto my head and pulled me back. \n\nI got extremely turned on and she did too. It didn\u2019t feel like we were brother and sister at all. It felt like we were long time friends who finally gave into each other\u2019s lust. Things got heated quickly and before we knew it, we were having sex. It lasted for around 10 minutes before we both finished. We laughed it off nervously and got dressed quickly. We chatted for just a little bit longer before finally deciding to call it a night. It felt so wrong and weird afterwards. The rest of my trip was super awkward. Us having to pretend that everything was normal with this being the biggest thing on our mind was challenging. But before I knew it, my trip was over and I went back to college. \n\nWeeks later I received a text from my sister asking if I had some time to talk alone. My heart sank because I knew it was going to be about that night. I put it off for hours before finally calling her. She called me to tell me that she was pregnant and she\u2019s 100% certain that the baby is mine. I was speechless. I wasn\u2019t expecting something like this at all. We talked and tried to figure out what we should do. We were cornered in a situation that was so above our heads we couldn\u2019t even figure out where to start. Abortion came into discussion multiple times but neither of us wanted that. We decided that it would be best to act like her husband is the father and raise it like so without ever telling anyone ever because of how wealthy his family is. \n\nShe is due the week of June 10th. Absolutely no one knows or has even the slightest clue. This is a secret that my sister and I put our life on to protect. Things will never be the same between us. The last handful of months I have become a heavy drinker and party goer and failing almost every one of my classes. It\u2019s messed me up a ton. It\u2019s going to be super weird whenever I have kids now too. It\u2019s so weird how a quick dumb decision could change the rest of your life.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "\n*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**AITA for refusing to push my obese cousin around in a wheelchair for a day?**\n\nMy cousin is approaching six-hundred pounds and requires a mobility scooter, as walking even short distances is very painful for her.  In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open.\n\nUnfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history.\n\nI did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either.\n\nThe distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that.\n\nMy cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.  My cousin has done a lot for me in the past, so I do feel bad saying no, but I feel like I've looked into every option at this point.  AITA for not being willing to just go and give it the college try?\n\nAlso, please don't degrade my cousin.  I know I can't stop you, but it's all been said before.

But on to the story:\n\nOh, yes, this is exactly what someone who is morbidly obese wants, the spectacle of someone who isn\u2019t strong enough to push her in her wheelchair over a bumpy path struggling to do it and possibly getting stuck and maybe even tipping over and then getting a bunch of people to carry her or even having to call fire and rescue to get her back to the car. That wouldn\u2019t draw any attention at all.\n\nThat would be far worse than riding on the back of a flatbed truck for 40 yards. Everyone would absolutely understand and be sympathetic.
