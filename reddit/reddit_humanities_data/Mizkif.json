            "Rob should be at the top of your list. It'd be nice to explore the dynamic as co-owners of a business.\n\nPeople behind the scenes at OTK Productions for their insights/perspective on events.\n\nPopular Collectors that can give more insight on the hobby (Leonhart might be a good one as I think he's in Texas. Maybe Island?).\n\nMMA people \n\nWhomever are the leading forces in creating Unrooted once that releases. \n\nKoaster/Sordiway\n\nMaybe some eSports players or legendary speed runners. They might stream, but you can talk about the competitive gaming side of things instead. Should be players for games  that Mizkif would know (Suigi, Doublelift, mang0, hungrybox)\n\nDave.\n\nSimpmom and Simply at the same time would be funny af.\n\nPlease don't get Stand Up comedians. They're on enough podcasts. Instead, use streamers like Comedians have used other comedians to build their podcast. They were able to do that because comedian hosts were able to relate to their comedian guests as peers and have stuff to talk about while (at least trying) to be funny.\n\nI'd suggest getting people that are around your hobbies/interests that aren't necessarily streamers at first. Gives you something to talk about. As y'all do more podcasts, expand to other topics. Even big podcasters who have all types of people on have a core set of topics that they can lean back to.",

            "would love to see people outside the streaming sphere, maybe some guys from youtube you wouldn't normally expect like Magnus Mitbo - a climbing youtuber, or maybe MPMD for fitness, supplements, and gym-related stuff. \n\nwould even be great to get people completely away from content creation like that time miz brought that tattoo artist on stream. \n\nthe most important thing for me is to bring in ppl miz hasn't interacted with much to get newer conversations and not repeating topics.",
            "For just chatting guests, you should use the natural resource of stand up comedians in Austin to increase your guest pool. They'd find it attractive as they value live audience and yours interacts primarily live. Your comedic style would create good chemistry and highlight your strengths in the podcast setting. Could provide a lot of new exposure on both sides. Might not be as hard as you think, there's already overlap.",
