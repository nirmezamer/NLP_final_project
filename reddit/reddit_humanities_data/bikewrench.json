Breaking this rule is a good way to get banned. \n\n2. Stay on topic - if your reply isn't about how to help OP, we don't want it. This is not the place for jokes, sarcasm, or obviously wrong answers. People reading this may not realize you thought you were being funny.\n\n3. Questions Only - Unless your post is a question about bike repair, it doesn't belong here. We don't need to see pictures of your latest build, or that funny bike that rolled into the shop. There are other subreddits for that. \n\n4. \"Is this cracked / safe to ride?\" posts are not allowed. - If you have to ask, don't ride it. We probably can't tell from a picture just what condition your bike is in. Take it to your Local Bike Shop and ask them. If it's carbon, they're probably going to tell you to replace it.",

It makes more than probably just me afraid to ask those things sometimes.\n\nI know you're a bunch of volunteers and may not have the time, but maybe you could piece it together over a period of time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: if you delete this because maybe I accidentally open the floodgates, I also totally get it",

            "I'd like to suggest that rule number two, no jokes, be framed or enforced loosely. Certainly, if someone's making fun of OP or posting a wrong answer, that's contrary to the spirit of the sub.  But I think that a little bit humor along the lines of casual chatting helps make this sub feel more like a friendly community.",

It also makes me wonder how they like it, where they got it and so on. Useful information arises from the ensuing discussion.\n\nSimilarly, pictures of workshops inspire discussions about keep things organized, caring for tools and so on."
