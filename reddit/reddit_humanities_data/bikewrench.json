Breaking this rule is a good way to get banned. \n\n2. Stay on topic - if your reply isn't about how to help OP, we don't want it. This is not the place for jokes, sarcasm, or obviously wrong answers. People reading this may not realize you thought you were being funny.\n\n3. Questions Only - Unless your post is a question about bike repair, it doesn't belong here. We don't need to see pictures of your latest build, or that funny bike that rolled into the shop. There are other subreddits for that. \n\n4. \"Is this cracked / safe to ride?\" posts are not allowed. - If you have to ask, don't ride it. We probably can't tell from a picture just what condition your bike is in. Take it to your Local Bike Shop and ask them. If it's carbon, they're probably going to tell you to replace it.",

Certainly, if someone's making fun of OP or posting a wrong answer, that's contrary to the spirit of the sub.  But I think that a little bit humor along the lines of casual chatting helps make this sub feel more like a friendly community.",

Why even allow comments and just have an automod that reads the OP question and links them to a site with the relevant information? Cut the middle man out and avoid even needing to enforce rule 2 at all.."

It has seen better days, but I was able to trade it in and not have to pay extra (I traded in a Schwinn that was made for a literal giant lol) so I was happy. Now that I have it home and cleaned up some, it needs a few things. Like a kickstand, a reflector for the back, a lock, and the MOST important, a bell and basket. Haha. Ok, those last 2 I can do without for now. My question is, in general, is it worth paying money to fix up an old beat up bike, or get a new one? I just have no idea what to do, and where to begin in any research or education. I would absolutely appreciate some guidance or opinions, please. Much love to all of you!",

            "Generally the pads should be toed so that the forward side is slightly closer with the rear angling outwards. I do this by getting the pads aligned correctly with the rim, hand tighten them. Then grab a wide rubber band and put that over the rear of one of the pads. With the brake lever depressed, i'll loosen then retighten the bolt on the brake pad. Repeat for the other side. If all looks good, torque down to 6nm making sure the pad doesn't rotate any while tightening"

            "Nope. I don't know why people say you can use those pads on chrome.  I would have told you in 1983 that it's a bad idea yet people STILL say it works. Autosol or a good metal polish will help. Good luck.",

Then, while building that wheel, I realized I rounded down on spoke length when rounding up would have been better (initial tightening of nipples with the nipple driver actually added tension so I didn't have a lot of room for adjustment). Overall, I loved the process and have been hunting for a reason to do another build. I have rims and hubs, but they're incompatible...",

You have to check everything yourself and use a spoke calculator to determine the right spoke lengths for your specific build. \nSecond: It doesnt look 2-cross. Wheelbuilding has a learning curve.
