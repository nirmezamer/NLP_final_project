It's explicitly stated in the rules.\n\nFor a while now we've been temp/perma banning people for breaking said rule.\n\nEffective immediately, any and *all* posts regarding politics, no matter how relevant, will result in an immediate 4 week ban. You may appeal this if it happens to you. But it's pretty straight forward. \n\nWe will no longer perma-ban first time offenders but multiple offenders will be perma banned, including those who post multiple politically fueled posts in one sitting before we catch it the first time. \n\nCovid-19's affect on business is not included in this.\n\nJust remember, r/business is a pro-business subreddit. We hold the right to remove anti-business propaganda, and bad company behavior belongs over at r/greed, not here. We will not ban people for these posts, however.",

        "content": "Hey!\n\nMy family owns a small business in the premium aromatherapy niche, and we've been fortunate enough to secure distribution at 60+ Whole Foods stores across Canada and the US, along with a few independent boutiques. Whole Foods is our biggest customer by a mile, and I want to expand.\n\nMy mom built the brand, my dad handles the logistics, and I handle marketing. I want to retire my parents off of this business while they're still in their early 60s, and I think we've got a solid foundation.  \n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* High shipping costs in Canada make B2C Shopify sales far less profitable than wholesale.\n* I've reached out to stores like HomeGoods, Anthropologie, Indigo, West Elm, and Free People but haven't made any progress.\n\n**What We've Tried So Far:**\n\n* Exploring platforms like Faire for wholesale orders.\n* Contacting buyers at local co-op groceries and boutiques.\n* Built a dedicated wholesale section on our website.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* Does anyone have experience with successful wholesale growth in the health and wellness sector? We're a home/lifestyle product, not a food or drink. \n* Are there specific distributors or brokers you recommend in the wellness niche? This is something new to me, and could be our key to success.\n\nWe charge $15USD retail per product, and selling 1000 units a month would be enough for my dad to quit his job and focus on this dream full-time.",
