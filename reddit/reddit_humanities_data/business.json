It's explicitly stated in the rules.\n\nFor a while now we've been temp/perma banning people for breaking said rule.\n\nEffective immediately, any and *all* posts regarding politics, no matter how relevant, will result in an immediate 4 week ban. You may appeal this if it happens to you. But it's pretty straight forward. \n\nWe will no longer perma-ban first time offenders but multiple offenders will be perma banned, including those who post multiple politically fueled posts in one sitting before we catch it the first time. \n\nCovid-19's affect on business is not included in this.\n\nJust remember, r/business is a pro-business subreddit. We hold the right to remove anti-business propaganda, and bad company behavior belongs over at r/greed, not here. We will not ban people for these posts, however.",

Whole Foods is our biggest customer by a mile, and I want to expand.\n\nMy mom built the brand, my dad handles the logistics, and I handle marketing. I want to retire my parents off of this business while they're still in their early 60s, and I think we've got a solid foundation.  \n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* High shipping costs in Canada make B2C Shopify sales far less profitable than wholesale.\n* I've reached out to stores like HomeGoods, Anthropologie, Indigo, West Elm, and Free People but haven't made any progress.\n\n**What We've Tried So Far:**\n\n* Exploring platforms like Faire for wholesale orders.\n* Contacting buyers at local co-op groceries and boutiques.\n* Built a dedicated wholesale section on our website.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* Does anyone have experience with successful wholesale growth in the health and wellness sector? We're a home/lifestyle product, not a food or drink. \n* Are there specific distributors or brokers you recommend in the wellness niche? This is something new to me, and could be our key to success.\n\nWe charge $15USD retail per product, and selling 1000 units a month would be enough for my dad to quit his job and focus on this dream full-time.",

            "We live in a global unevenly regulated capitalist world. If you want to offer game services or game products, you compete with whoever is on the market, regardless of your troubles.\n\nThe business doesn\u2019t care if you come from a war place, if your people have ASD or anything. If you manage to offer a good product/service you will be fine. Otherwise you\u2019re out.\n\nSo we scratch the whole part of your post with complaining about your shitty situation (sorry about that, but you\u2019ve asked how to make a game business, not for shoulder to sob on). What\u2019s left? You\u2019re in a poor and troubled country where people make very low wages and there are sanctions in place that prevent you from easily opening a licensed business that would offer services internationally.\n\n1. Learn to use VPN to get access to what you need. The fact you don\u2019t use one already hints that you\u2019re likely not that well technically speaking.\n2. You could leverage the low wages in your country as a good starting point for a business. If you\u2019re any good, you could be the cheapest outsourcing provider out there. Meaning that instead of trying to open a legally setup game studio, you start looking for freelance game dev jobs. You should be attractive with the extremely low wage you need. Then you grow this with adding new people.\n2. You could try building a product (full game) and then release it via a publisher. I wouldn\u2019t advise for this as it takes a lot of time and bears high risk of failure.\n\nAs for how do you exit the country and start a game dev business elsewhere - these are two very different questions you\u2019ve mixed together. Split your goals into smaller steps, order them and work one by one.\u00a0\n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40\u00a0",
            "I guess all the details came off the wrong way.\n\nto clarify: I ALREADY have experience in game dev and starting a business there,  \nbut all the details are to ask about the legal side of things, since it's very hard to find any legal matters regarding Syria online.",
            "I have ones who might help with stuff that don't require financial backing  \nbut asking one person to fund my entire leave is a bit unrealistic, so I gotta do that myself\n\ncan i make use of that? while keeping it legal.",
            "I think it came off as a rant by mistake, I always had issues with communication.\n\nNo, my question isn't how to start a game business, I've been around that for 10 years, I'm more or less experienced enough to start it, I briefly mentioned getting the Steam fee and my computer which while relatively easy outside, are near impossible here, and are the minimum required entry for such a field.  \nI'm aware of the situation, I'm not using it as an excuse.\n\nI'm asking how to LEGALLY start a business exactly because it IS a global requirement, I can't just use VPN then get legally questioned and say \"oh but I was poor in a sanctioned country!\"  \nit's me an the law there, and the law won't make exceptions, especially for something it considers illegal.\n\nI can leverage what I have (and I'm already doing it), I can sneak, I can do what's required to make the game, but unless it's legal, it would be the exact same situation as ripping assets off copyrighted games, and selling a game claiming it my own. that's how the law outside sees it.\n\nSo, any ideas how to manage the legal side?  \nthe other information were to skip through common questions I often get asked, and are usually a no brainer outside but a problem here.\n\nBTW, thanks for commenting, an I'm glad you're not trying to pat my shoulder.",
            "I figure if you establish in another country you can have them get you access to tools/ release things there to help fund your leave. Maybe you could get a startup grant or loan in that country that covers your exit from your country. I think for sure you could make use of it, I'd just do a little research on it to make sure there's no laws where you're at that are specific to those situations."

        "content": "**The Problem**\n\nResearch shows that a staggering 43% of pepople give up on their fitness resolutions within the first month. It seems like everyone wants to get fit, but many are unable to commit to doing so. On the other hand, from personal observation, some of the most committed people have been gamers working on building up the stats or skill level of their video game characters.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nWhat if there was a way for those aspiring to get fit to tap into the same level of commitment that gamers feel when developing their in-game characters? One solution would be to develop a training app that assigns the user video game-esque stats.\n\nEveryone with the app would create an in-game character that resembles the app user. Each user would then choose their fitness goals on the app, which would inform what attributes the in-game character would focus on highlighting. The in-game character would start 0 skill points for attributes such as strength, agility, speed, stamina, etc. As the user logs their training, the skill points per attribute would increase according the types of workouts, number of sets and number of reps completed.\n\nIn essence, the user\u2019s real-life fitness journey would be mirrored by the development of their very own video game character in the app. As the user progresses, their character develops as well (as shown through an increase in skill points). Skill points should also be prone to going down if the user does not stick to and log their workouts on the app over a set period of time, so as to create an incentive to commit to their fitness goals.\n\n**Social**\n\nThe app should do more than just track the user\u2019s progress, it should turns fitness into a social game. Users should be able to connect with friends and form in-app friend groups to compete on stats and encourage each other along the way.\n\nWith built-in accountability and friendly competition, this should reinforce commitment to said fitness goals.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Personalized Tracking:**\u00a0Everyone\u2019s fitness goals are different. The in-game character should primarily track the progress of attributes and skills you aim to develop. Whether you\u2019re into weightlifting, running, doing yoga, or something else entirely, the app should adapt to your preferences.\n2. **Game-like Progress Tracking:**\u00a0The in-app character should level up with each workout early on. However, as the user becomes more experienced, the rate at which they improve should often start to plateu in real life. The time it takes to level up should reflect this reality over time.\n3. **Social Interaction:**\u00a0Users should be able to share their achievements and join communities of like-minded individuals. The app should foster a supportive environment where everyone is working towards their fitness goals together.\n4. **Freemium Model:**\u00a0While the basic features would be free, the freemium version would offer additional perks such as advanced stat tracking and enhanced social features (or the social feature may be part of the paid experience entirely)",
