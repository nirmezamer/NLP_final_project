Nothing is really private on the internet, but it feels distinctly wrong to share pictures that may have been taken without permission or \"just shared with a few friends\".\n\nI've tried to condense what we really don't want to see into 500 characters.\n\n___\n\n##11.No Pictures of Children from social media\n\nWe can laugh at ridiculous clothing and other products, and other ways in which the straights are weird, dysfunctional and heteronormative about children.\n\nPictures from social media may have been used without consent or have been posted with an expectation of privacy.\n\nAny images of children, real or illustrated, must originate from Film, TV, Billboard or other Print media that is of an SFW nature and not intended to arouse.\n\nThis is not the place to document disturbing acts of sexualisation.",

            "On the note of dysfunctional heteronormative behaviour, there\u2019s this huge influx of stuff that really has *nothing to do with being straight* that people are posting because they *assume* the individuals behind it are straight. It\u2019s always the same: \u201cI\u2019d bet (deliberately obtuse amount of money) the person who did this is straight.\u201d\n\n\nThe content has nothing to do with heteronormativity, and more often than not is just something sexual that more and more people seem to be taking issue with. Sometimes not even that.\n\nAre posts here valid if the only straightness is in assuming the heterosexuality of the offender, or is this something we can start being a bit more selective about and perhaps reporting? I didn\u2019t come here to regress to puritan levels of \u201csex bad.\u201d",

            "> Pictures from social media may be being used without consent or be posted with and expectation of privacy.\n\nThis sentence doesn't parse. I think that \"and\" is supposed to be \"an\"? It still ends up a rather odd sentence though. I can't tell if it is part of the rule, or trying to explain the rule.\n\nAlso, the sidebar on old reddit has no rule #10 or #11.\n\nAnyway, seems like a sensible rule change.",
