Nothing is really private on the internet, but it feels distinctly wrong to share pictures that may have been taken without permission or \"just shared with a few friends\".\n\nI've tried to condense what we really don't want to see into 500 characters.\n\n___\n\n##11.No Pictures of Children from social media\n\nWe can laugh at ridiculous clothing and other products, and other ways in which the straights are weird, dysfunctional and heteronormative about children.\n\nPictures from social media may have been used without consent or have been posted with an expectation of privacy.\n\nAny images of children, real or illustrated, must originate from Film, TV, Billboard or other Print media that is of an SFW nature and not intended to arouse.\n\nThis is not the place to document disturbing acts of sexualisation.",

            "Glad to see this move honestly. Was getting a bit sick of everything in my feed from here being screenshots of gross pedo comments rather than the weird/forced heteronormativity that I used to chuckle over.",
            "I don't post here, but does blurring faces count?",
            "So for clarification - are pictures of kid's shirts that say stuff like \"Future Lady Killer\" or \"My Heart Belongs to My Daddy\" now verboten? I'm cool either way; this rule makes sense and probably should have been made long ago, I just want to know what I can and can't post.",
            "Okay, so, clarification: absolutely no pictures of kids from social media. Images can come from film, tv, magazines, etc. as long as its SFW.\n\nWhat about content that doesnt include images? I assume thats still allowed?",
            "Are we allowed to post if the pictures are censored for the protection of the people in the picture? Or is it non-negotiable. And Im thinking American censorship, not anime hentai censorship lol.",
            "So we can't post a SFW illustration someone made of a kid or kids, if that illustration is their original independent work and isn't taken from TV, movies, or other official sources? That seems a little silly.\n\nEDIT: My question is about why it can only be content from print media. Why can't I post content some guy on twitter drew that wasn't ever published anywhere?",
            "No. It's not about anonymity, it's about a type of content we don't want to see on the sub.",
            "use report reason \"doesn't belong\" to bring this to our attention. I know there has been a backlog in recent months but we're on top of it now.",
            "That's the type of thing they are saying is okay to post. \n\nWhat would not be okay is if you see your friend post a picture of let's say a woman with cleavage holding a baby and the baby like places his hand on the woman's chest or something like that and the caption is \"Little man knows what he wants! \" and you posted it here.",
            "Yes, posting the shirt itself is still okay! What is now disallowed is posting a picture of a child wearing said shirt"
