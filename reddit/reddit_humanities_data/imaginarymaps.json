            "I had a random thought about there being a triangle shaped state and I thought it was funny so I made it. \n\nSohcahtoa is a state in the West named after a Native American tribe with the same name. They were originally part of Mexico, but after the Mexican-American war, the U.S. acquired the land. Over time, it became the most populated state in the U.S., with Los Angles becoming the 2nd largest in the nation.\n\nSohcahtoa is known as the Tri State, due to it containing 3 large metro areas (Angles Coast, Sin City, and Pythagopolis), which contain most of the population and form a triangle across the sparsely populated deserts. Oh and also because the state looks like a triangle...\n\nSohcahtoa host teams for the 4 major sports, and the fan base for each of them have an intense rivalry with Colorado. Colorado is the least popular state in Sohcahtoa, only beating Wyoming slightly since no one lives in Wyoming either way.",

King Harold led his loyal men to the Eastric, where he pledged loyalty to Caesar Alexious and was granted land in what was then named Tauricland. Harlod's legendary might and wit as a warrior led to a fast exeouting of his ric.\n\nAt the height of its land, New Englaland ringed the W\u00e6rgengan S\u00e6. When the Osmans umbset Micelgard in 1453, the Niew Englisc warriors of the Roomany \u00c6\u00fetokratora helped turn the tide. The Niew Englisc King, Harold V, then handelened with the Roomany for the selfstanding of the Niew Englaland, becoming the Niew Englisc Kingric.\n\nSithen the Niew Englisc Kingric has remained selfstanding, notwi\u00f0standing the trying of the Keevaric and Osmanmong \u00c6\u00fetokratoras. Today it has a good sibred with Angers.\n\n(The New English Kingdom was established in the early 110s following Harold Godwinsons's escape from England in 1066. King Harold led his men to the Byzantine Court, where he pledged loyalty to Emperor Alexious and was granted land in what was then named Taurica (Crimea). Harold's legendary might and wit as a warrior led to a fast expansion of his realm.\n\nAt its territorial height, New England encircled the Sea of Azov. When the Ottomans beseiged Constantinople in 1453, the New English warrioes of the Roman Empire helped turn the tide. The New English King, Harold V, then negotiated with the Romans for the independance of New England, becoming the New English Kingdom.\n\nSince then the New English Kingdom has reamined independant, despite the efforts of the Ukrainian and Ottoman Empires. Today it has a good relationship with Franco-England.)",

            "There's a conspiracy theory that Harold survived Hastings, and went on to become a hermit. Pretty obviously not the case. I dont think a man as bold and as skilful of a tactican that he was would just go be a hermit.\n\nBut I thought why not combine that with Anglo-Saxons in Crimea for some fun. We don't quite know what happened to them. But I figured if they had a good general to lead off to a good start (and a fair amount of ASB) they could still around."
