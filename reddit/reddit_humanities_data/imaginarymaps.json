Been really into this idea and have been coming up with a bunch of ideas around it. If you have any questions please ask!\n\nWhat if Genghis Khan never united the Mongols and conquered half the world? With no devastating plagues and the wars against Batu Khan Hungary is able to continue on its original path. It has developed into a prosperous and diverse land nestled on the crossroads between east and west. Under rpd rule Hungary has been the acquisition of new lands, titles and many great building projects.\n\nContinued Halychian expansion as well as Russian migration into the region of OTL Moldavia has resulted in Vlach groups to move south into Wallachia or West into Transylvania. This has caused an ever increasing population of Vlach in Hungary. In 1483 the Sultanate of Rum would twice be repealed from conquering Belgrade. The second time they would be stopped just outside at the gates of Belgrade, preserving the array of Hungarian border vassals. King Stephen VI would successfully dislodge the Wallachians from Rumian influence in 1503 and lead campaigns in the Balkans.\n\nStarting in the later half of the 13 century a clan of Oriats would consolidate their rule over the tribes of the Mongol Steppe. Leading to many prolonged conquests west. By this time the Cumans around the Black Sea and Pontic Steppe had long converted to Christianity, by the 1300s. In 1483 a small clash between Cumans and a band of Oriats in the far east of Cumania would lead the Oriat Khan to move his army west for revenge. The nomads would lay siege to many Cuman fortresses using northern Chinese engineers. The Oriati campaign in the Pontic Steppe was the most destructive of the Khans. Fleeing this devastation west around 95,000 Cumans were welcomed into several eastern European states as settlers and especially as soldiers serving only the crown. Most of the Turkic peoples who settled in the Pannonian Basin throughout this time would eventually assimilate into the wider Hungarian culture. Most besides The Mehds who would go on to thrive in their new homeland. Leading many to migrate further south to join them.\n\nFollowing the 13th century Europe faced several large debilitating plagues and growing economic crises this led to the founding of several new popular Cristian sects viewed as heretical by the church. One of the most popular of these movements was in the border regions of Bohemia and Austria and in 1518 the pope would task the Holy Roman Emperor with eradicating the heretics. The Emperor would enlist the help of the Hungarian Crown this would lead to the quick invasion of Moravia and most of Austria. Hungary would annex some of these new lands leading to centuries of strife between the rpds and the house of Luxembourg."
