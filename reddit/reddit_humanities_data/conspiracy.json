Misstatements, misunderstandings, speculation and rumors are often reported in mainstream media, and become accepted by the public as factual, while later reports correcting misconceptions often go unnoticed.\n\nMoreover, this article is now four days old, yet surprisingly, it has received only scant attention [elsewhere on Reddit.](https://archive.is/2xmGj)\n\n**Associated Press** - By  Tia Goldenberg and Julia Frankel May 22, 2024\n\n[**How 2 debunked accounts of sexual violence on Oct. 7 fueled a global dispute over Israel-Hamas war**](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-sexual-violence-zaka-ca7905bf9520b1e646f86d72cdf03244)\n\nArticle archived here: https://archive.is/H2aay",

The other SA narratives got traced back to a man who didn't witness them but was told them by a single woman who claimed to witness the events.",

Meanwhile, in 2000, the CDC came out with a central repository/database for cancer statistics, likely in response to the upcoming bill ahead of time. It stands to reason that companies involved in the burgeoning big data management used this massive headache of an upcoming problem to their advantage and devised a solution as a selling point in their software which would have included regular cancer statistics- other companies likely caught on. Obviously this is speculation on HOW it happened, but it does stand to reason that a bill passing could cause a shift like that.\n\nIf you look at the Breast and Colon Cancer slides you can see a change in trends around 1990 also- right when the CDC first began collating statistics from the states that had any form of \"central\" repositories.",
