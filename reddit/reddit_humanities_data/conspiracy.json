Do and believe the opposite of what that guy says because he's probably the most horrific human in politics which says a lot. If you're wondering why - Unmasking citizens and doubling down saying it's justified. Faking surveillance FISA warrants. Reading a fake transcript as if it's real to congress. Hiding witnesses, then suddenly burying testimony some apparently consider exculpatory. Lastly his best friend and mega rich donor (Ed Buck) had not one, but multiple young black (barely adults) die at his home from overdoses and Adam didn't say a word.",

        "content": "A couple of years ago I was walking along my back deck to throw a bag in the trash bin. It was around 2 in the morning and it was dark out. I 'felt' something standing beside me so I stopped and turned and what I saw was what people call a shadow person, like the 'Hat Man' but no hat. It was about 7-8 feet tall, darker than the night sky and had two little white dots for eyes. It was in a solid form as I couldn't see through it. I freaked out, dropped the bag and just started blurting out \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...\" It immediately vanished and 4 feet behind where it had been, standing on the top of my neighbor's fence was a black cat glaring at me, it hissed before jumping down and running away. Ok, the cat being there can be easily dismissed as just a cat that happened to be there. I'm not saying it shapeshifted or anything like that. But, I know what I saw as far as the dark figure. It scared the shit out of me and probably the cat and I haven't found any logical theories as to what else it could have been. Anyways, that's one of my bizarre encounters. Anyone else experience this or something similar? - Edit grammar.",

            " A few years ago Glass exploded up out of the entire floor in a few rooms of my house .

I still have a grocery bag full of it",
            "When I was working as a nurse in the ER, I had a patient that was from a local mental health facility. She was a ward of the state and appeared to be a sweet, old lady. She had a staff member who was with her the whole time, some youngish guy. For whatever reason, I was getting weird vibes from her and made a mental note to be guarded around her. Kinda strange. I did my care for her in the room and left to sit just outside her room to document. I heard a growl come from the room, like a deep, menacing. All the hair on the back of my neck went up and I peeked into the room. The sitter guy was asleep and the lady was just staring blankly into space. I asked if she was ok and she said she was fine. Okayyyy, maybe I heard something else? I went back to charting outside the room and a few minutes later, the lights flickered and I heard another deep growling coming from her room. I got that gut feeling of fear and looked in again. The guy was awake at this point and looked terrified, the old lady was still spacing out. He heard it and said that she does that on occasion. I noped out of there. Pretty sure she was possessed. Thats the ONLY time Ive felt that kind of fear around a patient.",
            "When I was about 16 or 17 years old, I was playing video games in the living room by myself. It was late at night, not sure what time exactly. While I'm playing, my cat walks up to the glass patio door to be let outside. I get up and open the door for him and he hops outside. A few minutes later, he was sitting outside the door to be let back in, so I opened the door for him and he hopped back inside. I continued to play video games. About 5 minutes later, he's back outside the glass door meowing to be let inside. I could not believe what i was seeing. We lived in an apartment on the second floor and there was no way for him to be back outside on the patio. I just gazed at him for a few seconds, got up, and opened the door for him. He hopped back inside in the same exact way as he did the first time. Still to this day I have absolutely no idea how that happened.\n\nAlso, in this same apartment, I abruptly woke up at 3am for no reason at all. Just woke up, was immediately lucid like I wasn't even sleeping and sat straight up in bed. At the exact moment I woke up, my guitar across the room fell forward onto the floor, as if it was being lowered slowly. It was leaning against a chair, and literally fell forward -- it didn't slip or fall over like things normally would. I also have no idea how this happened or why I woke up out of nowhere to see it happen.",
            "Yep. When I was 8, we lived in a very run down apartment complex, surrounded by several other run down apartment complexes, in Jacksonville, FL. This was about 1984-1985. It was the end of Summer, school was going to start soon. It was hot, and there wasn't any air conditioning, and the apartment would be stifling at times. Because of this, many afternoons our family would sit outside on the stoop since it was in the shade. One afternoon we were outside playing football in the parking lot and my mom said, \"It's getting dark. You and your sister go inside.\" We did and started playing in our room. Everyone else stayed outside. As we were playing, I look up and see what I can only describe as a shadow man walk into the room and then physically turn off the light. My sister and I freaked out. I turned it back on, and it was gone. I went outside to see if anyone had just returned from being in the apartment, but everyone was exactly where we left them. In fact, my mom was sitting crossways in the stairwell, so no one could have gotten passed her without her knowledge. She said that no one had been inside but us. This was the only way inside the apartment because the back door was broken somehow, and it was a 2nd floor apartment so no one could have climbed through the window and escaped that quickly without making all kinds of racket. I still remember this vividly 40 years later.",
            "one time i was walking along lake erie early in the morning, and i almost stepped on a lobster looking thing, except it was completely transparent which is why i almost stepped on it to begin with. i walked around it looking at angles to make sure what i was seeing was actually there. i shouldve taken a photo but was more terrified than anything and continued my walk.",
            "I saw a UFO out in the California desert south of Barstow. I was a truck driver making a run at like 3am and I was sick of driving interstates so I got off and cut out on back roads. It was dark but there was a line of hills silhouetted against the stars on my right. Over those hills I saw a green light rise then fall. Then another. Then another. \n\nGiven the area, it was probably artillery at Twentynine Palms or military aircraft or something but I cant actually say. And holy FUCK is it unnerving when youre out there all alone in the dark. All I could think of was that movie *Fire In The Sky*.",
            "Don't know if it's what you're asking but I had an outer body experience once. Could see me and my two friends from about 1m behind and above for a few seconds. I wasn't in control of my physical body or the viewing angle so it was just like watching a live video. My friends didn't believe me",
            "This story happened back in 1985 in Akron, Ohio. My younger brother and I were using my tape recorder. We had a cassette tape that was blank as it was brand new. We decided to make fun of our pastor whenever he gave the Sunday sermon by imitating his cadence. After about 15 to 20 minutes of goofing off on this tape cassette player, we decided to listen to ourselves by playing it back. When we played it back, our voices did not sound like our voices and everything that we said was playing backwards along with this weird static sound. This scared the shit out of both of us so much so that we tried to beat each other running down the stairs hollering to tell our parents. When we went back to play the cassette to our parents, our voices were on the tape. After that, we never spoke of it again. To this day, this occurrence makes my hair stand on end. There is no explanation.",
            "I was in an old growth rainforest along the California coast. Me and my buddies went for a walk, nice sunny day, birds chirping. Super nice. Suddenly everything turned off, all the birds became quiet, bugs shut up. Me and my buddies stopped and were like wtf? I looked ahead of me and I shit you not I saw a black shadow coalesce and then like some kind of amorphic goo scoot along to another tree and go inside of it. After this, all the birds and bugs started chirping again. I was tripped out. They didn't see it either.",
