        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nWe've been doing our best to keep this subreddit as safe as possible, and making sure that our team is as healthy and happy as possible. However we've noticed that there are a few gaps in our team and we're looking to do our best to fill those in as best as possible. If you're interested in helping us out as a moderator, we would love to have you! To give any prospective moderators an idea of what to expect, here's about what we see on any day:\n\n- A modqueue (what we use to quickly access comments) that gets about 100 items in an hour, give or take, most of which is easy to approve, but we get a lot of trolls as well.\n- A ModMail that gets ~5-10 messages in an hour, most are quite kind, though we do get our fair share of people who are trolls or like to argue a lot.\n- A team that genuinely holds a lot of love for each other and does it's best to help each other out when we can.\n\nThe only real requirements are that you're transgender, you're active on Reddit and/or on our discord, and that you're a good fit for the team, however we are really looking for applicants that fit any of these criteria above anything else:\n\n- Able to look through the modqueue during the US evening hours (9PM EST - 7AM EST, or 1AM UTC - 11AM UTC)\n- Able to look through the modqueue on weekends (Saturday/Sunday)\n- If you're a Trans Person of Color we would love to have your perspective\n\n# [If you think you'd be a good fit, or if you think you'd be interested in helping out, please fill out this relatively simple google form and if we think you're a good fit you'll hear from us soon!](https://forms.gle/hK6SvtTBBi36Jdk19)",

            "After something I saw this morning, remember only voting for the president doesn't do enough. You have to vote top to bottom. From the president all the way down to your local constable. They all matter and they all have vast potential to make our lives worse. Find out your states elections make sure you're registered well before",
            "Here is a quote from Project 2025, a conservative plan for what to do after the 2024 election.\n\n  \n\u201cPornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered\u201d (5).\n\n\"Pornography\" is a dog whistle for any material with any mention of LGBTQ+ people.",
            "How long will I have to get out of here after the election? I want to go to college, kind of need my parents' support, and I'm really scared for the future. I live in Georgia too. I'm fine with not being able to medically transition during that time I guess, but suspect even socially transitioning is going to be targeted eventually. What can I do? Can I do a year of college here then do the rest in another country? I'm so scared.",
            "Please vote for Biden \n\nTrump would not only make you illegal and start a genocide of the entire LGBTQIA+ community but also whatever democracy you have left \n\nYes he is being pretty shit right now but think about yourself first and save yourself",
            "Don\u2019t forget to vote for local offices that actually control your day to day lives on April 2! I\u2019m running for my County Board which also oversees public health. We need to do what we can to be in the room when people are making decisions about us. If I get elected I\u2019ll be the first out queer person elected to that body. (I identify as a trans-nonbinary bisexual polyamorous person.) I\u2019m hoping I can pass some ordinances to ban conversion therapy from county health services and hire trans affirming therapists to our county mental health program. \n\n\nMany of us trans folks really struggle to fundraise because we do not have the same access to people with money as others. Unfortunately everything from mailers to printed information to hand to people when we knock on their doors to Facebook ads all cost money. If you have the ability to donate to get a local to you trans person elected, you should! \n\nIf you\u2019d like to make a compaign contribution to get a trans nonbinary person elected in Wisconsin here\u2019s my act blue! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gloria-eastman-1\n\nETA: Also if you think you might be a good choice to run in your districts (hint, you are. This is a country by the people and for the people.) You should visit this website and start planning a run for your next election cycle. Start going to your local board, committee, commission and council meetings. Here\u2019s where to start. https://runforsomething.net/run/ \n\nreach out to your local activism orgs like whatever the [people\u2019s action](https://peoplesaction.org/) group is for your state, since they are expressly wanting to help trans people run for office. Working Families Party is also a good option.",
            "Because I'm tired of people saying that voting third party is a solution, I'd like to break down why it wouldn't work. So, as I understand it, the popular vote in presidential elections exists to elect electors in the electoral college. Some states go by majority vote for the whole state while others do majority per district. The reason why voting third party will not work without considerable reforms is that a third-party candidate would have to win the support of a majority in a lot of states. Now, putting aside registered Republicans and Democrats who are unlikely to vote third party, that leaves independents. Independents span such an incredibly large political spectrum that courting enough to make any meaningful change is unlikely. \n\nJust to show why even with popular candidates what I'm saying is true, look at Ross Perot. He got roughly 20% of the popular vote and I believe he was the most popular third-party candidate of all time. He didn't get a single vote in the electoral college. If you need any more proof that only the electoral college really matters look at the 2016 election. Trump lost the popular vote but won the electoral college by a landslide.",

            "I have a couple family members who have been very supportive of my transgender teen, but now they are saying they don\u2019t know if they will vote for president at all or might just vote third party. We live in a red state (R +5) so it probably won\u2019t matter anyway, but am I overreacting by being hurt and angered by this?",
            "Okay, so (for the sake of argument, let's say) you're voting for Biden because the system sucks and you have no other option. I can respect that. However; why aren't you trying to change the system? I swear if even half the people who said \"you have to vote for Biden; he's better than the alternative\" started working on things like primaries, ballot proposals (ranked choice voting?), or really doing any politics other than just voting once every four years, Biden would never have happened in the first place. Go vote for Biden in November, I know I will too, but *please* recognize that you've made the bed you're lying in.",
