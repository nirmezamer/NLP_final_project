        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nWe've been doing our best to keep this subreddit as safe as possible, and making sure that our team is as healthy and happy as possible. However we've noticed that there are a few gaps in our team and we're looking to do our best to fill those in as best as possible. If you're interested in helping us out as a moderator, we would love to have you! To give any prospective moderators an idea of what to expect, here's about what we see on any day:\n\n- A modqueue (what we use to quickly access comments) that gets about 100 items in an hour, give or take, most of which is easy to approve, but we get a lot of trolls as well.\n- A ModMail that gets ~5-10 messages in an hour, most are quite kind, though we do get our fair share of people who are trolls or like to argue a lot.\n- A team that genuinely holds a lot of love for each other and does it's best to help each other out when we can.\n\nThe only real requirements are that you're transgender, you're active on Reddit and/or on our discord, and that you're a good fit for the team, however we are really looking for applicants that fit any of these criteria above anything else:\n\n- Able to look through the modqueue during the US evening hours (9PM EST - 7AM EST, or 1AM UTC - 11AM UTC)\n- Able to look through the modqueue on weekends (Saturday/Sunday)\n- If you're a Trans Person of Color we would love to have your perspective\n\n# [If you think you'd be a good fit, or if you think you'd be interested in helping out, please fill out this relatively simple google form and if we think you're a good fit you'll hear from us soon!](https://forms.gle/hK6SvtTBBi36Jdk19)",

However; why aren't you trying to change the system? I swear if even half the people who said \"you have to vote for Biden; he's better than the alternative\" started working on things like primaries, ballot proposals (ranked choice voting?), or really doing any politics other than just voting once every four years, Biden would never have happened in the first place. Go vote for Biden in November, I know I will too, but *please* recognize that you've made the bed you're lying in.",

            "Hope everyone is doing fine. I have a question that got me embarrassed a few days ago. I was visiting a friend who transitioned 4 years ago. He was with me and my brother by the pool while our parents where looking to old photos (they are friends since college, about 30 year ago). On some of those photos my friend was really really young and on our collective memory still remembers him as a little girl, I even heard my parents referring to him on those photos by his old name while I was walking to the kitchen for some beers. His parents said nothing and the conversation was fun and full of good memories as far as I noticed, but that got me thinking what is the best thing to say on scenerios like this? Should I never used the birth name after transitions, even when referring to a trans person when they where a toddler? Since my friend wasn't inside and it seems to not be a problem to anyone I decided to not even ask him what he thinks of this and just enjoy the day.\n\nI should add, there is no pre transition pictures of him hanging on walls or anything, only at family photo albums. Nobody calls him by his female name anymore, outside of this scenario.",

            "(SLIGHT TW: mention of d3@th and t@nsphobi@.)\nI'd say yes, but the only time I'd heavily suggest having that conversation is if you persue a sexual relationship with someone OR if you suspect for any reason a person you know could be transphobic (if you can safely ofc, I'd also suggest just cutting them off if you can) I only say this not beacuse I don't want anyone to live their life how they want passing as cis or not, I say it because I want everyone too be safe. Sadly many trans people have been hurt and/or k-lled because a partner didn't know they were trans. But in everyday conversation and just friends no one should give a shit and you're completely fine :]",
            "you dont have to tell them if you dont want to.",
            "Its not odd. Id say if thats what you wanna do then by all means, do it. Hell, even before I passed I used to say I was a late bloomer, or I had some testosterone deficiency. Even now, unless I feel comfortable telling someone, I dont mention the fact Im trans. \n\nIt all just depends on how you feel and what you think is the best for you.",
            "I'd say the only people who need to know are those you are in a romantic/sexual relationship with and your healthcare provider (healthcare only when it's medically relevant). The only reason why I think it's important to tell the person you're having a romantic/sexual relationship with is often times, if the partner finds out later either from you or by someone else, it puts the trans person in immediate danger. I don't want more of our trans brothers and sisters to die. If you don't want to flat out tell the person, you can always just ask how they feel about the trans community and then assess it from there. But please, disclose that to them as soon as possible preferably before the first date/meet up. However, for people you meet out and about? They don't need to know you're trans.",

Staying stealth in your day to day life with people you meet on the street is one thing but there are some people you should tell: medical professionals and people you have a romantic relationship with and are considering sex with. Other than them, it's entirely your call but medical professionals need to know so they give the proper treatment and people you're going to have sex with should know (I'd even argue the moment a relationship starts to form and before even a kiss, they should know). This second one is for your safety and multiple other reasons.",
            "I so wish we lived in a world where being trans was just an interesting piece of trivia about you. Where some of us might bring it up if it was relevant to the conversation, and some of us wouldn't.
