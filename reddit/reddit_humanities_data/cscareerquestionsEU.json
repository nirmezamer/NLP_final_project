If the companies main competences are not around SWE you'll not get to 140k + because they don't require such highly skilled people\n\n2) You go into tech where SWE is part of their main capability.

I only have 3 years of experience, I never leetcode, I can barely solve an algorithm to save my arse and I'm just an average developer. \n\nI got fired because of lack of work on Wednesday, luckily I was already applying since Monday as I saw it coming. I managed to send 10 applications, I had 4 interviews, 1 offer I accepted and was in a position to decline the other 3 offers.\n\nSome of you may be struggling, but there's definitely hope.\n\nI managed to get most of the interviews done within the same week because I always told the recruiter that I have already had offers from other companies. All of them suddenly managed to make time for me. The company I accepted the offer from managed to interview me in just 3 days time all of sudden. (3 rounds). The quicker this process is, the less chance you have of a better candidate coming by and the less chance they have to consider you.\n\nI managed to get a 30pct salary increase in 1 year just by lying about my current salary. Technically I didnt lie, its just the way I calculate things. They couldnt match my \"current\" salary but I still managed to get a 30pct increase.\n\nDespite being an average developer, I managed to gather a very broad skillset outside of my comfort zone to market me, in just 2 months. I learnt front-end frameworks, Kubernetes, Operations, etc. I never mastered them but knowing 20% seemed to make me 80% more attractive.\n\nI asked for feedback from every one of them, and my number 1 response was my enthusiasm. I always end the meeting with: \"Thank you for your time, I found this really interesting, especially XXX\". This one I always kept in mind because as a consultant, I had interview-training about every month or so, and all of them said the same.\n\nUse this bit of hope and these 2 tips I have found very effective and send your resume now.",

            "Congrats!\nCan you tell what\u2019s your stack, YOE and new salary?",
            "You are right, finishing with enthusiasm can be super important. \nWe rejected a Harvard Physics PhD because it was so obvious he didn't care about the topics of the job at all. He just answered yes/no on everything. That also explains to me why some interviewers always ask \"tell me about a time where you worked with X\" instead of \"Do you have experience with X?\" and assuming they would elaborate instead of just saying yes or no ;).\nIt was almost impossible to get any discussion started except when we asked about his hobby passion, then he didn't stop talking (but that wasn't related to CS at all).\n\nAt the same time we all agreed upon a person who had a different background but was obviously so enthusiastic about the topic she'd be working on, gave a super polished presentation about a hobby project she did and ended with how interested she'd be in this job. And it really seemed sincere.\n\nMy actual favorite was a guy from ByteDance who I had really deep conversations about our topic with and it also goes the other way round - he wanted to continue the process even though it became clear that he probably earns more than 2x or 3x (seems the recruiter wasn't clear about base salary vs total comp...) because he enjoyed our discussion so much lol.\n\nStill feeling bad about for the people though because after we put so much effort into interviews \"all open positions were re-evaluated\"",

            "Thanks for sharing your experiences. I would say the market is not terrible for engineers with some experience. Also, reading what you've said above, you seem like a good candidate. Unfortunately, I can't say this for a lot of candidates. I've taken part in hiring rounds before, and so many candidates are just unemployable. \n\nCongratz and good luck",
            "It's just luck, but I think you can raise your chances a lot.",
            "The interview trainings were always from specialized companies and recruiters that my company provided. They invest this time because they get a bonus if I get hired, this is usually higher than the bonus you get from regular employees, so some of them take the time to do some training.\n\nSome lessons:\n\n- Constantly ask questions\n- Do keep some questions for the inevitable \"do you have any questions?\". You never want to say no to this question.\n- Ask more questions\n- If you're in a technical interview, ask even more questions because interviewers are time restricted, the less time, the less questions they can ask. This can work both ways though, beware.\n- Never shoot down small talk, always go for it when the opportunity arises. Personality is a huge deciding factor. It does not matter if they hire you as the personality hire.\n- Try to schedule interviews right after lunch time.\n- Answer every question in a way so they know it can benefit the company. Try to sell yourself.\n- If you don't know something. Just say you don't know it and ask them to explain it. If they explain, you can always twist it in a way like \"ahhh, we had something similar in my company, it was of yada, yada and yada.\" Most of the times I was not familiair with the name of a concept until they explained it. Then I explained that I knew the concept but I didnt know the name and show them some examples of where I had used it. Free technical interview points.\n- Always show ambition, but be realistic. In the past, I got turned down because I had lots of ambition and I wanted to get to management. Unfortunately they understood that 2YOE me wanted to be a manager soon, even though I told them that this is a goal in 10 years from now.\n\nThese are the common tips I always got from them.",
            "Located in NL.\n\nI had lots of LeetCode questions during my consulting times, but I always had someone internally leaking me which question it would be, so it wasn't really fair.\n\nThe last 4 interviews as a non consultant, I just had theory questions, I also had one time where they asked me to pair program one user story. I loved the last one because everyone on the team tried to guide me, but of course I had to start by saying my general process. (I would look where the request would go, then dive into the code, look into the tests and adjust the code accordingly. For example). I also took the time to have a chat about current events with the team beforehand, so that could be why they helped me so much because we both enjoyed each others company.\n\nThere is a way to avoid highly technical interviews, and I have yet to crack it. Maybe I am considered a personality hire. I do come across as very enthusiastic (fake it until you make it, I'm really introverted, trust me). Maybe its because most companies don't ask LeetCode here, unless you're applying for top companies. If you apply for top companies, you may be doing it for top pay, but there are still lots of companies that pay very well and barely do any technical interviews (Go for global, HUGE, companies not listed on levels.fyi or whatever site. They have the budget.). The offer I got, had a technical interview planned today, but instead I asked them if I could see their warehouse during this interview (I was really interested in it tbh), we went there and had no time for technical questions at all. I got hired 2 hours later."
