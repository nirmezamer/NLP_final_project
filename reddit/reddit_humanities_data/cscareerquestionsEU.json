        "content": "Hi all, i have a question about work culture in Germany (specific reference to IT, and startups etc). I am currently working at a company , and it has been rocky. I am facing some communication challenges with the team. However, I am held accountable for not doing the work exactly as they wanted it, when in fact I do it and give suggestions how something could be done instead.\n\n1. It seems as though an instruction is given- with limited room for debate and conversation and I'm expected to follow it exactly they want it. This feels controlling and I'm not used to this. Add the communication barrier and now we have it harder.\n\n2. The culture seems a bit punitive. i got scolded when my work was not exactly the way they wanted it - when in fact it was supposed to be for feedback, and I was told I am holding up the project.\n\n3. They don't appreciate too many questions and I cannot challenge the ideas in the face of new data coming in, dependencies or constraints. When I raise this, it is not addressed correctly and the impression is that I am not doing my work correctly.\n\nSo, am I just working with a difficult person (this seems to be the tone at the company however), or do companies in Germany follow a hierarchy? I'm used to working with British/American/etc companies and there is room for debate and ideation. I feel like a misfit here and it's getting difficult to operate like this. Is there a cultural nuance I am not aware of here or maybe I should communicate differently? This is taking a toll on my mental health. Thanks all.",

Besides all of this I feel a huge hesitation around me having a more visible role even when I\u2019m doing all the technical work of the team. Another thing is that the Germans of the team are in a closed group only calling the shots\u2026",
            "Im sick of this German behavior of gaslighting people washing up bad business behavior from other Germans. It is your responsibility as German to acknowledge what your people is doing in order to change things, otherwise it\u2019s same old same old\u00a0",
            "I don\u2019t intend to gaslight but find examples that would encourage a certain behavior while being clear that I have no clue what\u2019s up in this company. I didn\u2019t justify it either. But if you understand why people act a certain way you can try doing something about it, if you want to. Of course people can just be dicks but I find these everywhere. If someone wants to rule out certain companies, like Germans, because of bad experience go for it - who am I to judge. I just shared that my experience was different.",
            "What you're describing is company specific, not Germany specific. It's a toxic company culture you can find in companies around the world.\n\nThankfully, there are also companies where working culture is great, also in Germany.\n\nAnd dude... as soon as I've read that you \"got scolded\" I'm like, GTFO out of there. Scolded? WTF is this, kindergarten? That's not okay.",
            "Sorry to interject, but OP's experience describes parts of my experience... Except that I'm Greek and worked in Greece for a Greek company.\n\nI wouldn't exactly claim that sociopaths or ego tripping boomers who think they know it all and trying to understand them by asking questions is evidence that you're clearly not intelligent enough to agree with them. \n\nI also don't think this is \"German behavior\" or w/e.",
            "There might be so many factors at play it\u2019s hard to say why you experience this situation. It might be culture, e.g. if it\u2018s an old German company and/or IT is maybe just a means to the business. Or maybe if it\u2019s an early startup there are founders with very strong opinions and limited runaway.\n\nI worked at two German companies, both around 8 years old when I joined. I did not have that experience, but I\u2019m German myself.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a culture thing and I wouldn\u2019t rule out German companies going forward yet. I think you might be looking for a more modern work environment?\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s sounds like you should start looking for something new that you\u2019ll enjoy again. Try to think about your interviewing at this company and how you could spot such environments early on. Good luck!"

I only have 3 years of experience, I never leetcode, I can barely solve an algorithm to save my arse and I'm just an average developer. \n\nI got fired because of lack of work on Wednesday, luckily I was already applying since Monday as I saw it coming.

All of them suddenly managed to make time for me. The company I accepted the offer from managed to interview me in just 3 days time all of sudden. (3 rounds). The quicker this process is, the less chance you have of a better candidate coming by and the less chance they have to consider you.\n\nI managed to get a 30pct salary increase in 1 year just by lying about my current salary. Technically I didnt lie, its just the way I calculate things. They couldnt match my \"current\" salary but I still managed to get a 30pct increase.\n\nDespite being an average developer, I managed to gather a very broad skillset outside of my comfort zone to market me, in just 2 months. I learnt front-end frameworks, Kubernetes, Operations, etc. I never mastered them but knowing 20% seemed to make me 80% more attractive.\n\nI asked for feedback from every one of them, and my number 1 response was my enthusiasm. I always end the meeting with: \"Thank you for your time, I found this really interesting, especially XXX\". This one I always kept in mind because as a consultant, I had interview-training about every month or so, and all of them said the same.\n\nUse this bit of hope and these 2 tips I have found very effective and send your resume now.",
