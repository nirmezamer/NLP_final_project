        "content": "my opinion is that FSD should be bound to your Tesla account, and always yours on your account, this way there are no \u201cdifficulties\u201d on the sale process as stated by Elon on last call. You log in with your account, and bam, it\u2019s unlocked. Log out? Disable. Log in in another car? Unlock, simple. Also should be available in my opinion to all cars in your account, but ok, allow to transfer from car to car inside the account, activate in only one car (or 2 or 3, how many fsd licenses you bought), lock to the car for a month or 6 months or so, if they don\u2019t want people to keep changing it.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

            "This kind of post has been made before. Why does tesla not do that? Because they can profit more from the gimick of FSD by locking it into one car instead of one account.",
            "No it should be locked to neither and be transferred as simple as a form. \n\nWant to transfer it to a new car? Great. Want it to stay with the car your selling and don't have another Tesla? Done. Want to sell it to someone else and keep the car. Done.",
            "Then the price would be higher.",
            "What if you have more than one car on your account? FSD is hardware dependent. By making it tied to a car that has the proper hardware, you avoid confusion about where you can or can\u2019t apply the floating credit. \nI think it makes sense as an upgrade on the car just like any other software or feature upgrade. But I do like the ability to transfer it in the future.",
            "All other features on any other car have always been \u201ccar locked\u201d. Hardware like a moon roof for example. Also, what if a different car doesn\u2019t have the right hardware? Not saying I disagree, but I think those are the reasons.",
            "Tesla, in all likelihood, is probably going to kill off the option to purchase FSD outright and just make it a $100 a month subscription, like a phone bill.  There's more profit in it in the long run, and less people bitching about transfers.\n\nElon made a statement during the shareholder meeting about how \"for a low monthly fee, these cars will drive themselves around\", which tells me, in his mind, FSD isn't a package that's bought, it's a service you pay extra for, like a cell phone plan.\n\nPeople wanting FSD to follow the *person* are stupid.\n\nFSD has *massive* on going R&D costs.  It's not something you crank out and say \"Ok, we're done here\".  It is going to continually evolve and improve over time.\n\nIf you sold FSD once and tied it to the user, wherein they could use it anywhere they wanted, then there'd be an upper limit as to how often they could sell it, and they likely wouldn't be able to keep funding the R&D anymore.\n\nLet's look at Microsoft as an example, because honestly they're the most comparative.\n\nWhen you buy a computer from the store, it comes with a copy of Windows.  That machine has a Certificate of Authenticity (COA), and the license *cannot* be transferred to another computer.  When a new version of Windows comes out, you're typically offered an upgrade discount, where instead of paying $120 for Windows, you can pay $80 or something.\n\nEventually, however, the hardware on the computer ages itself out of being able to run newer versions of Windows, and you need to buy a new computer.  When you buy the new computer you get another copy of Windows that cannot be transferred, and the cycle starts anew.\n\nThis is, in effect, the position that Tesla is in.  Every time they release a new FSD hardware version, they can release a newer/better version of FSD software to run on it, but at some point the older hardware is going to stop running the newer software.  For HW3 people, that moment is coming up at the end of this year.  We'll still see some improvements, but once they start working on HW4, it'll start doing shit better than HW3 can.  Not right away, might take a year or two, but it will.  Just like when they're ready to start doing HW5 the HW4 folks will slowly stop getting cool shit.\n\nIt's going to be a never-ending cycle.\n\nIf they allow free unlimited FSD package transfers, they'd never properly fund the initiative.\n\nVarious holes can be poked in my analogy above, because Microsoft *does* sell a retail license, where if you buy a barebones computer, you can go to the store and buy a copy of Microsoft and slap it down on the machine, and *that* license is transferable to a new computer, however, it doesn't let you upgrade to a newer copy of Windows for free, but you can buy an upgrade license for a discount.\n\nAnother hole that can be poked is that the upgrade from Windows 8 to 10, and 10 to 11, were both free, however, Microsoft was effectively doing **a lot** of damage control from how bad Windows 8 was, and they're also trying to encourage people to stay on a current release of Windows for security purposes.  That said, going from Windows 10 to 11 isn't always easy.  There's a hardware restriction in that upgrade path in that your computer has to have a TPM 1.2 chip so that Windows 11 can properly leverage its security features and such, so for some people their only option to go from Windows 10 to Windows 11 *is* to buy a new computer, even if they have a retail copy of Windows and an upgrade license, there's a hardware incompatibility.\n\nSo, I get where people are coming from about wanting FSD to follow the user, however, in the long run, there's no profit there, and the profit is important to fun R&D to make FSD better.\n\nAnyone who bought the FSD package, myself included as I've bought it twice, needs to accept the fact that it's tied to car you bought it for, and when you trade the car in, or sell it, FSD needs to be purchased again.  I've been fine with it the entire time, *because* I'm aware of the development costs and such.  I've bought FSD at $6,000 and $12,000.  In retrospect, I regret not getting the monthly subscription on the $12,000 car.\n\n*All that said*, I do believe that there's a path for Tesla to offer \"upgrade discounts\", much like Microsoft did, where if FSD is currently $8,000 a person who already owns it and is buying it again can buy it for 50% off or something as a \"loyalty discount\", or if they *do* make it subscription only, then the person can convert their $8,000 FSD license to say four years of FSD on a new car, then $100 a month after that.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my rather lengthy thought on that.\n\nStop bitching about a lack of license transfers, they need to pay for the development of the software somehow, and this is *very* common in the software industry.  The only \"perpetual software\" licenses that you see now involve paying monthly fees to get at the newer versions.",
            "It should be treated as a license like most other software. You own the license to use it on one device at a time but that can be any device. \n\nTesla has the mistaken belief that they will make more money if it is tied to a car. I disagree as we all see how many people refuse to buy it not knowing they can keep it.",
            "I\u2019m another that would move up to an X if I could transfer FSD to the new one. I only had EAP but would pay the $2000 to get FSD before purchasing the X.",
            "I don't disagree -- Tesla is basically using the money for R&D.\n\nThe true Full Self Driving feature that works the way we want it to (and the way Tesla implies how it will one day work) will never appear on any Tesla on the road today.\n\nBut keep dropping the cash for \"FSD\" to play with a shitty beta.",
            "It would be too easy to pirate if they did that. You could just let other people log into your account and people could sell fsd. Keeping it var specific makes more sense ."

I just bough another Model Y with diff. specs and whole experience was bad as well. It looks like Tesla is critically understaffed.
