I need some advice on:\n\n**Model Year Differences**: Any significant updates to know about from one year to the next? Like, is there any year you'd recommend not buying anything older than?\n\n**SR vs. SR+**: Is the price difference worth it? My thought is I don't want the \"cheapest\" Tesla\n\n**General Tips**: Any buying tips or things to watch out for?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

My haven't gotten an update to my car since 2021 (and even the Tesla service centers can't do it - I've been to 4 different ones in 3 different countries); I can't use maps or plan where/when to charge. I did find an adapter that lets me charge at ONLY the Tesla Stations that have the slower 150kw charger, and I'm thankful for that (even though it takes an hour to charge for every 3 hours of driving - not great). I feel like there's got to be a way to get a US Tesla to work overseas. Right?? \nEven with both arms and legs tied behind its back, it's still the best thing in the world to drive. Especially here in Europe. (And selling it won't help. It's paid off and no one here would buy it.) ",
