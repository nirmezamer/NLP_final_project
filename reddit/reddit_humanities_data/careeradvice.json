Although the salary covers my living expenses, it doesn\u2019t leave much for savings.\n\nI've just received a remote offer for $42K/year from another company. While the pay is much better, I know I won\u2019t enjoy the job as much.\n\nShould I stay at the job I love or go for the higher salary? What factors would you weigh if you were in my situation?\n\nEdit:  \nJust to clarify, I live in Egypt, The average annual salary here is $5K/Year. People consider $24K/Year to be a shit ton of money over here.",

            "$18K can buy a lot of enjoyment for the 120 hours you don\u2019t have to work.",
            "$42k, but that\u2019s still way low for a salaried job, that\u2019s only the equivalent of a $21 an hour job",
            "If you earn 5 times a typical salary, why is there no room for savings?",
            "You have to give yourself a raise and a cost of living increase and take that damn job !\n\nKeep it for a year, and start looking for your next job/promotion now as you transfer into that new job\n\n. Sadly the only way to make more money is to move up from within or leave and take another job elsewhere.",
            "What I have realized is that you will have peace with the job you love and then burn out with the one you don\u2019t love. When you love a job you will do it effortlessly and get frustrated with the one you don\u2019t.\n\nWhat about you go for the one you love and then look for another job that wouldn\u2019t stress you out. That way you work on jobs you love and would do rejoicing, and at the same time make more money.",
            "Spend your money on your values. That goes with the opportunity costs as well.\n\nStashing that $18k away per year would give you a lot of freedom in the future. But having puece of mind and enough free time to enjoy your 20s is also very valuable (and you'll appreciate the memories your entire life).\n\nOnly you can answer the question of value though. Is the joy from your work worth $18k/yr? Both options sound like winners to me.",
            "That edit was the most important info.\n\nWhat are your life goals?\n\nIs there anything you need to accomplish that you'll never be able to without doubling your pay?\n\nIf not, stay where you are.\n\nBut ask for a raise. Maybe mention that offer. **Tactfully.** I don't know how things work over there. Don't get yourself fired.",
            "one question...how soon will you get a raise at your current job to match your new job?  I have a sneaky suspicion a very long time to never.  \n\nYou're barely making ends meet.  Even when you get the $42k job, you'll need to still look to grow and probably change to a job where there is room to grow and make more money."

I changed roles or jobs regularly, sought out the jobs or projects I wanted, networked, did a lot of professional development, earned new credentials, etc. \n\nHowever, now I find myself at 60 and I feel mostly tired and not interested in climbing the corporate ladder any further. When I am in annual performance reviews or discussions about the future/next steps I am honest that I am content doing what I do at the moment and my goal is to retire from full time work within 3 years. \n\nMost of the time when I speak to senior management about this I get shock and surprise. They can't believe I don't want to push towards a job as a VP or something.  And I wonder sometimes if its because people who are driven towards \"the next step\" will do more, put in more hours, push to increase their profile, volunteer for extra tasks, etc. These are those things that many of us end up doing to be seen as that person who will go above and beyond. However, at this point in my career I just want to work my regular hours, meet all my job expectations, take my vacations, get paid and just... ride it out. \n\nAs I do so it will be interesting to see whether my employer will be ok with that. After all I'm not donating a bunch of extra work and time for no extra pay lol. ",

Yeah, sure, high performers are nice for a little while, but then they move up and move on and I'm left with a hole in my team.  If I knew I had you on my team for 3 years to be focused on your work and not worried about your next role, I'd be happy that you've chosen me as the boss to ride out the end of your career with.",
            "NOT AT ALL. I think it\u2019s super healthy. \n\nIve also been ambitious and driven my whole life, and recently challenged the idea that working your way up in a company is what success looks like. Success should be framed as being happy and healthy. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more to life than working your way up in a company. You trade so much more of your time, health and peace for more money, more stress, more taxes and more expenses like outsourcing house or other work. Also the return on stepping up for extra work is often so incremental, so why bother.\n\nWhen I see people in senior leadership positions, I think you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to do that shit.",

            "Most businesses today wouldn\u2019t dream of making someone a VP at sixty if they hadn\u2019t already held that role somewhere else. The assumption is often that if you haven\u2019t made it by 45 you probably just aren\u2019t up to it. It\u2019s bullshit of course, but that\u2019s the tyranny of youth.\n\nIt\u2019s sensible to drop down a gear when you get towards retirement age (if only for the sake of your health) and nobody should feel guilty about it. I\u2019m heading towards retirement myself and see my main value to the business now as mentoring, coaching and training the next generation rather than trying to scrabble up an ever shortening ladder. Kick back, relax, enjoy your success, and start planning holidays.",
            "The way I have put this is this:\n\nI'm still engaged in my job. I enjoy the work and my coworkers. I'm committed to helping solve <this company's> problems.\n\nBut I'm past the point where I'm worried about career development. \"Where will I be 5 years from now\" isn't commuting to an office.\n\nBut right now, I'm here and I'm working.
