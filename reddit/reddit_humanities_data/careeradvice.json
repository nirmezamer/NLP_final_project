        "content": "Hi all,\nI\u2019ll try to be succinct. I\u2019m at a severe crossroads in deciding whether leaving a toxic boss for a potentially other toxic boss is worth it. I\u2019m in a true \u201cdevil you know\u201d dilemma. \n\n- Had a really hard week at work a few weeks back. I hate-applied to a few roles. \n\n- within a couple weeks I found myself having a 2nd interview which has now led to an offer. This new role would come with a $12k increase and I\u2019d be making $94k. The role would come with a pension if I stay in the sector 5 years. This is the incentive for me going. \n\n- my present role pays $82k. It has an amazing 401k match (higher ed). I am beloved in the role and am doing meaningful work. However, my boss is truly unsupportive and seemingly personality disordered. It\u2019s a walking on eggshells situation. \n\n- I love my coworkers for the most part, but they are VERY intense. It\u2019s sort of due to the field (social work). Every week there is drama and fires. I am very adept at choosing peace and staying out of it all, but it\u2019s a lot emotionally. So much so that a third party is helping with the organization and culture. \n\n- I have hesitation to take the new role due to red flags in the process, and tepid interest in the role. New boss emailed several times on weekend and at night during the interview scheduling. When I asked about work life balance (what I value most) - they had a pretty crappy answer which could be summed up as \u201cmost people take\nAn hour lunch.\u201d This, coupled with her time stamps on emails has my gut saying she\u2019s intense. She also is coming off as a micro manager. When asked for references I was given 24 hours to provide 5 heading into a holiday week where most of my references wouldn\u2019t even be in town. The speed by which they\u2019ve moved is something I\u2019ve never seen in public sector.  \n\n- even though my present role is a shit show, I\u2019ve now dialed in exactly what I need to do and I have the respect of my directors to the point where my boss basically leaves me alone. \n\n- I actually turned down the offer for this new role. But the hiring manager wanted to talk about it and max-offered me\nOn the role. She described some of the challenges of the predecessor and it included them asking other people too many questions and that whomever is in this new role will need to go through her as a middle man. \n\n- realistically I can do my current role at about 30 hours a week. And I have the fog of war to take my time. I\u2019ve done great work there and I don\u2019t need to grind anymore. \n\n- new role is not exciting. I would have zero colleagues that do similar work. I would most work in isolation aside from daily check ins with my new boss. \n\n\nLong story short, my close people advise to stay put. I don\u2019t have the energy or spirit to want to hit the ground running in a new role - but getting into the state has been a long term goal of mine. \n\nDo I take the opportunity , or do I trust that I have the equity and skill set to wait for when it feels right? Is $12k and the chance for a pension enough to take a role with a boss that could be tough?\n\nI am sick with worry. ",

I have a history of running from situations into other bad situations - frying pan to the fire. I am only walking peacefully to new roles and picking carefully. I will never intentionally work for another person who shows traits of PD (poor boundaries, responses or humor that is cruel, lack of compassion/empathy). Could you stay and continue to apply for positions intentionally and focused on what matters most to you?",
