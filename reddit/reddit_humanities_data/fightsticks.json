        "content": "Old one was getting pretty daunting, so here's a new megathread\n\n# WHAT\u2019S A FIGHTSTICK?\n\nIt\u2019s a controller reminiscent of the controls used in an arcade cabinet, generally featuring a joystick and multiple buttons. Most can be played on a lap, while some are heavy and large enough to warrant a table or platform underneath them. Using one over a standard handheld or console controller won\u2019t magically up your game and they are largely preference. They are most commonly used for fighting games, shmups, run \u2018n guns, and classic arcade titles. At their simplest, a fightstick requires an enclosure (usually made of wood, acrylic, or metal), buttons, a joystick, a PCB, and a wiring harness to connect everything. Additionally, all-button fightsticks that don\u2019t utilize joysticks are becoming more commonplace on the scene.\n\n# WHICH STOCK FIGHTSTICK IS BEST?\n\nThis is largely a matter of taste and budget. Here are just a few options to get you thinking.\n\n***ENTRY LEVEL:*** Qanba Drone and Mayflash F500\n\nIf you go much cheaper than these options, you may sacrifice quality and durability. DO NOT GO CHEAPER THAN THESE OPTIONS.\n\n***SOLID LEVEL:*** Hori Real Arcade Pro N/4/V, Razer Panthera, Qanba Obsidian, Qanba Pearl, Hori Fighting Edge, Nacon Daija, 8BitDo, Mad Catz TES+ (and Razer Atrox for Xbox One players)\n\n***SOLID BUT $$$ LEVEL:*** Qanba Dragon, Victrix Pro 5, etokki Omni\n\nAt the end of the day, go with what feels right and fits your budget. There are lots of awesome sticks out there. If you *really* can't make up your mind, go with an Obsidian/Pearl. Really though, if you're still that on the fence, then you can also consider building your own. They come together fairly easily these days and it's super fun (though they will usually run at a higher price point than a stock stick unless you can easily get or make a suitable enclosure). Just more food for thought.\n\nFor more in-depth reviews: [Jeux Arcades](https://jeuxarcades.com/best-arcade-fight-stick-for-fighting-games/), [ConsumerExpert](https://consumerexpert.org/best-ps4-arcade-sticks/), [Tom\u2019s Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1295-best-fight-stick.html), [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/356446/how-to-choose-the-best-fight-stick-no-matter-your-budget), [bestarcadesticks](http://www.bestarcadesticks.com/), [thearcadestick](https://thearcadestick.com/)\n\n# WHERE CAN I BUY NEW, STOCK FIGHTSTICKS?\n\nPrice the sticks accordingly across the following websites.

Most buttons on the top face of fightsticks are 30 mm. If you have smaller hands or want that Hitbox vibe, then 24 mm might be appropriate, but most of the time, people go with 30 mm. Auxiliary buttons (home, share, PS, etc.) are generally where you find 24 mm. All buttons have a unique feel, but some common brands include Sanwa, Seimitsu, Crown/Samducksa, Hayabusa, and GamerFinger. Here's a helpful page about button and joysticks: [Joystick and Button attributes](http://slagcoin.com/joystick/attributes_brands.html)\n* When you\u2019re ordering your buttons, you\u2019ll also notice that there are generally both snap-in and screw-in button types. Most of the time, it won\u2019t matter which you choose; however, as a general rule of thumb, if the top face of your enclosure is on the thicker side, go with screw-in buttons.\n* Make sure your layout lines up with your art. Some printing shops won\u2019t print art with existing licensed characters, so you may have to visit more than one if you\u2019re trying to get it done locally.\n* You\u2019ll need to keep in mind the games you\u2019d like to play and on which platforms they are found. Look to see which consoles the stick actually supports when you\u2019re buying. If you\u2019re building your own, then make sure the PCB you choose is compatible with your console/PC. The PCB most common to this generation of custom sticks are the Brook brand PCBs.\n* Most stock retail sticks come with Sanwa parts (besides Hori which comes with Hayabusa).\n* American style parts will most likely not fit a Japanese stick due to height.\n* Korean levers with collars won't fit a traditional Japanese stick due to the size of the joystick hole.\n\n# QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE POSTING A \"HELP ME DECIDE\" THREAD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Is a fightstick even right for me? For some of you a fightpad or other device might be      better for you. This is fine! I don't care if you play on a [Roll n' Rocker](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Roll_%27n_Rocker) on top of a [Power  Pad](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pad) if it works.\n2. What's my budget? This may quickly cut out a lot of options for you.\n3. What systems do you want to be able to play on? (PC, XBox, Switch, PS, etc.) This should      reduce your list even further, though you can (conceivably) get adapters for other systems if need be.\n4. Do you want a lever, stickless, or all of the above? (that last option will almost certainly need a custom build)\n5. What button layout do you prefer? Vewlix, Noir, American 6/8, Sega 2P, custom? [Slagcoin carries a lot of these](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html). If you're not sure, see if you can demo some in your local area. (Used) game shops, arcades, LAN centers, video game conventions, and pawn shops are possibilities.\n6. If using a lever, what kind do you prefer? Generally this will be Korean (Fanta, Crown, etc.), Japanese (Sanwa, Seimitsu), or American (Happ, iL)? Most sticks will use Sanwa or Sanwa clones.\n7. How \"moddable\" do you want things to be? This isn't just important for upgrades, it's also important for repairs. Consider how easy it is to access the internals and to change them.\n8. What features are a must have (and yes, it can be as \"trivial\" as artwork you like or a turbo button, hey, it's your stick)? You can then eliminate sticks that don't have them.\n9. What features are a \"no go\" for you? Now eliminate sticks that do have them.      This could be something as simple as \"don't want sticks that weigh      over X pounds/kilos because I'll be traveling with this\".\n10. You should have a fairly narrow field by now, with any luck. Next consider your \"nice to haves\" and \"nice to not have\" features. For example, you might consider \"removable USB cable\" a nice to have (but not essential) and \"width of greater than 16 inches\" a \"nice to not have\". Then just see which sticks have the most positives and least negatives.\n11. If you're still having trouble, please list your top 3-5 options after running through the      process above, with your comments on each. This will help us help you make a decision.\n\n# LINKS/YOUTUBE\n\n[Core-A Gaming](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg)\n\n[Scanline City](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC95ay1z3kKNTPo6Prjsz2Dw)\n\n[NihongoGamer](https://m.youtube.com/user/NihongoGamer)\n\n[Alex Nostalgix](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UChXa1coCGkJsFTChIg9K0Mw)\n\n[HurtboxTV](https://m.youtube.com/user/HurtboxTV)\n\n[JasensCustoms](https://m.youtube.com/user/AngryJasen)\n\n[Hit Box](https://m.youtube.com/user/HitBoxes)\n\n[JoyStickNY](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCcMXeGTcdFkIrY-IxiBLr5g)\n\n[WoolieVersus (Scrubguides: Arcade Sticks 101 video)](https://youtu.be/6Oexnpq3HKI)\n\n[JonyFraze](https://m.youtube.com/user/soulfunknjazz)\n\n[Mr. Sujano](https://m.youtube.com/user/2007silverado4x4)\n\n[Chanchai](https://www.youtube.com/user/SaintChanchai)\n\n[JUANminiDIY](https://www.youtube.com/c/JUANminiDIY)\n\n[The Arcade Stick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWiT6NUZk4pQMvpxOa4ZMw/videos)\n\n[butteroj](https://www.youtube.com/user/butteroj)\n\n[Mr. Arcade Fox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVq_gsXV8OqvvgkUqwLarg)\n\n[Hush My Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/c/HushMySweet1)\n\n# DISCORD\n\nOur vision is to continue to grow and be a hub for fighting game controller tech as well as a safe space for trades and sales, something like the spiritual successor of SRK\u2019s Tech Talk and Trading Outlet.

Please no price flaming and remember that it\u2019s always a good idea to pay with the PayPal Goods and Services option so you are covered if the deal falls through. Any questions, ask one of the Discord mods. Also, if buying and selling fightsticks is your primary interest, consider visiting [r/Fightsticksforsale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fightsticksforsale/) since that is their main area.\n\n**Huge thanks to hugs\\_n\\_giggles & Zevaeros for helping with this FAQ.
