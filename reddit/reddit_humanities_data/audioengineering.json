            "Hi there! I'm using a Behringer U-Phoria UMC1820 with the purpose of recording on PC me and my friends chatting (I use Windows 11). I plugged the microphone, I downloaded and installed the drivers, I turned the Audio interface ON (of course), but for some reason no sound comes out of it from the headphones. I selected the mic output correctly because I can clearly see from the settings that the audio is coming out of it (the audio bar receives sound), and I tried selecting the playback as an OUT of the interface, but even if I select my own monitor as an audio output, I can't hear anything. I even recorded it thinking that perhaps I can't hear the sound at the same time, but nothing comes out of it, only a distant and very faint whistle. Any help..?",

The roof is trated with panels and the walls too, but it has some empty spaces that are producing reflexions.\n\nI'm trying to make an space for people to be able to record music or produce a podcast.

            "I've always had issues with lots of noise when using my Shure SM7B. It's never really been too much of an issue since I would just use the noise compressor filter with OBS, but l've recently started using it more for singing and the noise compressor filter loves to cut out a lot when holding notes. Because of this, I can't record with it, but if I don't use it I get constant and very noticeable noise. The microphone is quiet so l have to bump up the gain to 26 (which is the most OBS lets me) but ofc that bumps up the noise as well. I've tried combatting it in Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition with various filters and effects but they all have some very noticeable draw back like making me sound like I'm underwater or making the audio scratchy bc its too loud. A few months ago I saw something about the mic not being plugged in right, so I fiddled with it and plugged it into a few different USB slots in my desktop which helped but only the tiniest bit. My microphone also seems to be a lot quieter ever since then for some reason; I used to be audible but now every quiet sound effect like opening up a new tab seems to overtake my voice. I've tried using a cloud lifter, and maybe I didn't use it correctly, but it didn't seem to work. I haven't seen almost anyone with this same issue, and every video I see on it seems to work extremely well with no noise right out of the box. If anyone can help me, please explain your solution to me like you're talking to a 3 year old, as I have next to know knowledge about audio and different audio terms. I'd send a clip of what it sounds like but it won't let me attatch a video :/",
            "Hi friends, the time has come for me to expand the studio. I am currently doing 2.1 with KRK Rokit 5's and KRK 10S. I'm considering 5.1.2 or 5.1.4. I have questions. If you are kind enough to reply, please feel free to reply to any combination of these.\n\n1. Are there other brands of speakers that compliment the KRK Rokit's or ones that I should avoid due to different tonal characteristics? I've read I could just get an additional Rokit5 and turn it sideways for the center?\n2. Is there practical arguments to be made for or against in-ceiling vs on-ceiling speakers?\n3. My home office is 14' x 8.5' with 8.5' ceilings. Does this make it impractical to go for 5.1.4? FWIW, I will be here for at least 5 more years, if not more, and we own the space so holes in the ceiling are A-OK.\n4. I have an Audiobox 1818VSL I purchased in 2018 that I'm pretty sure is going to do the job here, but I'm open to looking into any other recommendations from y'all for a newer audio interface. I constantly switch between my Macbook (with 2 OP docks lol), PC (has SPDIF out, and 3.5 inputs for Rear, C/Sub, Mic in, Line out, and Line in), and my LG C3 42\" for reference and casual media watching.\n\nI am currently using a 15-year-old Audiobox USB and just moving the USB between PC and Mac when needed - it's not compatible with my TV but looking forward to better mixes when I finally get this 1818VSL set up in this space! That said, if there's an interface that I can just connect EVERYTHING to, I may decide that convience is worth the extra $$$.\n\nI'm probably forgetting a bunch of things but I'll leave it at that for now. Please help alleviate my GAS so I can start properly mixing for theaters and VR stuff. TIA!"

It's either too harsh or too dark\n\nIt's also pretty noisy IMO (surprisingly because it's supposed to only have 9db (A) of self noise using an RME UCX II preamp and I often find myself in RX trying to remove some of the hiss so it doesn't pump up with compression \n\nAny recommendations on other mics that have a modernly bright but not harsh high end? \n\nAnd for those owning an OC818 have you noticed the same things?

            "ultrasonic is over 20k. \n\nThe OC18 is known, like the C414, for a detail peak. \n\nIt sounds like the noise issue you are fighting is your room noise, it doesnt have a very tight pattern.\n\nMy recommendation would be treating your space. (Though you might find the warmer sound, presence peak, and extremely tight pattern of the BeyerDynamic M90X more pleasing, its $150 down form $380 on amazon atm, made for poor spaces).",

I have 40 cm thick bass trap clouds, panels on the sides, corners, and in front of my desk + a few at the back: I'm talking about hiss in the background of the recording (not sure that comes from ambient room noise)  \n\nYeah I was wondering about people who have both the oc818 and C414 about their experiences \n\nI just listened to Lewitt's pure tube audio examples and it's also pronounced in that area, maybe a tad smoothed but still to bright IMO\n\nwhat's your favorite vocal mic?",
            "Yeah i'm sure",
            "Yeah white noise is everywhere, when you take all the noises and all their reflections that everything makes in a city, it all blends together into white noise. Being in a shared building ith whooshing ventilation etc will make things worse. Theres not a great deal you can do about that without building a suspended room in a room (ie an isolation booth) and even that will only do so much (literally be cheaper to rent a room in the country, too).\n\nThe one thing you can do is use pickup pattern and the inverse square law to your advantage. Make sure you (emitting the signal and blocking the noise) cover as much of the pickup angle of the mic as possible by using a mic with as tight  as pattern as possible, and being as close as practical. \n\nMy favorite mic is probably the C414 XLII, my fave vocal mic is probably the Electrovoice RE20, but theres no mic thats going to be right for everything, and honestly i dont own either as my home studio just isnt good enough for the C414, and i dont need the Re20 sound (and modular synths cost too much lol). Honestly my fave mic on \\_my\\_ voice is an AKG D5, had it a long time and know how to use it. I have technically better mics, it just suits my boomy, somewhat nasal voice.",
