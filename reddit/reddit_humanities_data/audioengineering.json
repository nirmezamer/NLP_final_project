            "Are there any good mics out there in the lower-mid range budgets that are similar sounding to the Sony C-38b? Specifically for drum overheads. I did a session over the weekend at an actual pro studio for once and the engineer used a pair of these for overheads, and I absolutely *love* the way they sound. Then I found out how much they cost lol.\n\nIt's not so much that I *mind* spending used-car amounts of money on a pair of good microphones, it's just that as a non-professional it's a bit hard to justify considering the rest of my signal chain being nowhere near the same league (and my skill set, too). I suppose they would probably retain their value pretty well, but I think I would feel crappy about it anyway. Like buying a vintage Ferrari when you don't have a garage and can't drive stick.",
            "Rodecaster pro 2 + shure sm7b + win 11 + audition\n\nHi I have the setup mentioned in the title. When I record to a single track using MME the microphone's volume is high enough. But when I use ASIO to record multiple tracks the volume is super low even when win 11's mic input is set to 100 and the fader is set at the highest position on the rodecaster. Why is this the case? And what settings should I use to make the audio sound louder from the source without editing?",
            "Hi. I am using passive speakers. I connect them using speakon cables to amplifier. Could you please tell me if I can use XLR TRS balanced microphone cables to connect amplifier with mixer?",
            "Hi All! I have a Tascam X6 that I use with Roland CS-10EM Binaural Microphones/Earphones. The mics work great on the 3.5mm input jack when PiP (Plug in power) is turned on, but I'd like to use these (and DIY PZMs) with the XLR inputs but I'm pretty confident turning phantom power on for these inputs would zap the Roland CS-10EM.\nIs there a simple circuit to turn 48V phantom into something the mics could use? Do i need an inline preamp?\nThanks in advance, everyone! :)",
            "Hey, I cant decide between the SSL2+ and the Scarlett 2i2 Gen 4, my primary use is for recording and playing guitar (with some plugins not just clean di monitoring) so low latency is my priority. I also need the midi for keyboard and drums but thats about it.\nany advice and are there any other recommended options?",
            "Hi guys, I recently acquired a Zoom R16 Audio Interface second-hand in very good condition and I have been attempting to use it. First, I installed the appropriate drivers and updated the firmware on the R16 following the company's guide. After that, I attempted to connect the audio interface via USB, but I kept just getting connecting and disconnecting audio from the USB. After about 30 minutes of this, it just randomly worked perfectly, and I have no idea what did it. After turning off my computer, though, and then turning it back on, we were at square one again, and it has since not connected. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers several times, scoured forums, checked my USB drivers, and used different cables and all of my different USB ports. At this point, I don't know what to do. I have contacted customer service, but they have not responded yet.\n\nI have a Legion Pro 7",
            "This might be a dumb question, but if Im recording my bass D.I. with a JHS Colour Box V2 using the XLR output, do I need to have the Hi-Z switch toggled on my interface?",
            "Any good recommendations for good quality Lavalier Microphones on a budget (<$100)? \n\nIm planning on doing content creation and filmmaking. Let me know if you know a good one!",
            "Ive been, relatively, inactive in the professional audio world for some time now. I used to work professionally, but its been a long time since Ive recorded anything but myself. In a recent effort to downsize Ive been really trying to consider what I actually need. Ive used a pair of NS10s for about two decades now, but Id really like to move to something powered, and maybe something a little less NS10-y. I mix mostly in headphones now (I travel a lot and use the Slate VSX headphones). Something that sounds good when I want to show my wife what Im working on, but is also usable from a mixing standpoint (maybe with a sub?). Powered is important - would love to get rid of the power amp. I dont need the best, but I also dont want the worst.\n\nBudget is a couple grand, but Id prefer to spend under a grand if thats realistic. Im not doing professional work anymore so it really doesnt need to be the best of the best. But Ive been out of the loop for so long, I dont really know whats out there. I was looking at the Yamaha HS-7/8, maybe paired with a sub. But am I too far on the consumer side? Is there something else I should be looking at?",
            "Hi! I am soldering my own XLR cables using Canare Starquad 4-Le6s wire and NC3M/FX XLR connectors, however, I havent been able to find any information online about the maximum length cable I can make with my specific wire. From what I can find about similar cables, the recommended maximum seems to be approximately 100m (200-300 feet). If anyone knows what is the best range or where to find that information, that would be very much appreciated! Thank you for your help!!"

            "Being acoustic instruments, I am not sure this is as much a baby grand vs. grand issue, is it is this specific baby grand vs. this specific grand.  So many possible variables that will contribute the the final sounds when you are talking about different tone woods, wood ages, construction methods, etc.  All that said, I've used a couple mics, set up very close to the hammers.  I usually like to capture something a little more distant too, even if I eventually decide to not mix anything in when I get right down to it.  Which ever you go, there are quite a few different mic techniques you can use with a piano, and it may just be a case of trying different mics in different spots to find what works best with each one?",
            "Obligatory I dont know what Im really talking about so take this with a grain of salt but In my experience having a lot of booming bass sounds kind of muddy. Having tight and focused bass sounds punchy and clear. Perhaps the extra size of the grand doesnt offer the same punch and clarity as the baby grand.\n\nIve noticed this with kick drums. A huge 24 inch kick drum is super boomy but a an 18 inch kick with a shallower depth cuts through the mix and punches just right.",
            "Its does depend a lot on the piano. There are some really nice sounding baby grands but there are also some really nasty brittle ones that sound like someone hitting your skull with a rock hammer.",
            "We have a Steinway model s and model d, the model s sounds better in every single recording. Weve tried ~10 different ways of micing and Ill take the baby grand every time",
            "Its similar to how 1x12 and 2x12 guitar cabinets usually sound better than 4x12s. Or how DI bass is usually what gets used over bass amps. Theres a magic to 60Hz through 5-10kHz that the extended ranges cant capture. 16Hz can be fun but 65Hz is far more useful.",
            "Depends on the piano it isnt a baby grand vs grand thing also depends how it was recorded.",
            "Different pianos work with different arrangements.  A Yamaha C7 is more or less the standard in studios working in pop, rock and jazz.  A 9' Steinway D (at 3-4X the price of the 7' Yamaha) is what most solo performers request for classical pieces.  Longer bass stings reproduce a lower fundamental.  Shorter pianos' low notes are just a series of harmonics of the fundamental.  The harp matters, the strings matter, the pinblock, sound board and case matter.  The player and the room matter.  There are just too many variables that factor in to a piano's sound to judge it solely on its length.  The only guaranteed difference is how much of the fundamental frequency the strings can emit.",

I tried finding some of baphometrix\u2019s music but all I could find were two songs from 6 years ago. No hate on her, mad respect for putting that much content for free, but does this technique expand beyond just hitting lufs targets for tearout edm?

            "Its absolutely worth learning, you dont need to apply this technique on every project but it is very useful when needed, you can achieve massive drum sounds with it",
            "Short version is clipping your master sounds nasty because you get a lot of inter modulation distortion which does not sound good in equal temperament. So you wanna clip each of the drums separately.",
            "I tried watching the playlist but honestly could not endure it. The content seems mostly inapplicable whenever live instruments and/or analog gear/emulations are central to the workflow and zero seems arbitrary. Baphometrix actively disregards certain tools and workflows and, in doing so, seems unwilling to extend the branch to other fields. \n\nThat said, it has made me less fearful of clipping and I think a lot of the ideas _could_ apply to organic music but Im not keen on adapting it myself.",
            "Clippers are extremely useful for managing atonal transient peaks, allowing you to push your tracks louder and get a good balance between peaks and RMS volume. They are in these specific scenarios vastly more transparent than limiters. This knowledge is useful for any style of music, even when not pushing stuff massively loud, as transients and knowing how to shape them is incredibly important for getting mixes with clarity and definition for each instrument. \n\nThe Clip To Zero method specifically is intended for very loud stuff, but the general knowledge on the usefulness of clippers is universal. I would recommend sitting through the whole series, as it is very well articulated free knowledge right at your grasp, but you can also just take the time to experiment with clippers on your own.",
            "So turns out I have actually been doing this with drum busses and bass busses the whole time lol. However, those two busses are usually sitting anywhere from -8 to -12 each. Also I never do this with other groups though, I cant imagine clipping piano strings or acoustic guitar haha. Also I think its worth mentioning that I DO make dance music but its on the more minimal side of uk 140 dubstep so the only thing I canter about is loud bass and drums with dynamic range. I cant stand the overcompressed 150hz snare drum, I need groove, swing and volume changes in the hats/ percussion. Some reference artists for this style are hamdi, hypho, dmvu etc",
            "Concept has been around for a long time. I found myself experimenting with it before clip to zero came about. \n\nClippers have been useful to train my ear to hear dynamics better. Try using them for a while and see what you discover.",
            "CTZ is a technique to control dynamics and thats all it really is, it goes around the idea to applying little clips and limiters across your entire chain instead of slamming everything hard into a final limiter is better, and it is. So, its a method to work and think about dynamics at your reference loudness (whatever that may be). It will make you consider your arrangement and sound design choices at reference loudness.\n\nIts not necessarily just for loud music. Just helps one think and control dynamics through their workflow.",
            "Have you read the Google doc she posts in the comment section of every video? It summarizes the series really well.\n\nOne thing she demonstrates in the videos is a way to reduce all clippers simultaneously, and she shows how less dynamic range really does sound worse. You'd still use the technique because it often sounds better than only limiting the 2 bus, but the only reason she slams her music that hard is to not be jarringly quiet compared to other artists in her DJ sets",
            "It's really helpful. Even for music that doesn't require crazy loudness units. I think transparently clipping unnecessary peaks is always worth it, even if it's only a db, you basically get free loudness when only clipping a little amount. Your waveforms will be more consistent and also prevent downstream processors like compressors from overworking. And when mastering, I will almost always want to pre clip before the final Limiter (and before mastering compression).",
            "It's basically a version of the \"make it loud first then fix whatever needs fixing\" strategy. Works great for loads of people"
