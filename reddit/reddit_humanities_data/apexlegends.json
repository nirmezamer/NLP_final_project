        "content": "This post is for feedback regarding matchmaking in all modes. \n\nPost thoughts, criticism and suggestions you have on matchmaking.\n\nTo make this constructive and not just be \"matchmaking bad\"  (which everyone \"agrees\" on but everyone else means a different thing by) or \"why am I facing three stack preds?\", make sure you explain in as much detail as possible what you mean. Here's some questions that help with that, so go over them and see if you can add information to your comment:\n\n- What mode are you talking about?\n\n- What do you consider good/bad/fair matchmaking [in that mode]? What do you think is healthiest, individually and/or for the player base as a whole (across skill levels)?\n\n- What kind of matchmaking do you want for ranked/pubs/mixtape/solos? [possibly: completely random matchmaking; loose skill based matchmaking/tight skill based matchmaking; loose rank based matchmaking in ranked/tight rank based matchmaking; something else]\n\n- What kind of matchmaking are you experiencing (vs what you want from that mode)? In what ways is it a problem?\n\n- How do you assess the strength of your lobby / strength of players you are facing? Badges (which ones) / trackers / current rank / ...?\n\n- What is your current rank?\n\n- What is your skill level (highest previously achieved ranks)?\n\n- How should matchmaking deal with parties of varied skill (or rank) / how does it deal with it / how good/bad is the experience (and again it's important to distinguish whether you're talking about ranked or pubs here)?\n\n- With regards to smurfing: How much of a problem is / how does it affect your experience / how easy is it to do/how common is it / What to do against it?\n\n- Thoughts on ranked resets (their effect on matchmaking)\n\n- What is your experience of matchmaking in high ranks / matchmaking in low ranks? How does it match with what you expect from ranked?\n\n- The above mostly focuses on \"skill\", but since it's come up recently from time to time (with XDefiant as well), what are your views on input based matchmaking (including potentially negative effects it might have on all of the above). Remember to please keep it civil as this is a topic that constantly leads to toxicity and incivility / personal attacks, rather than level-headed discussion of arguments.\n\n- Related to the previous point, what about cross play between PC / console?\n\n- [I might add more points here if anything comes to mind.]\n\nYou can also post proof of the situations you're encountering (links to screenshots / clips, you can upload them on imgur or similar).\n\n---\n\nFor reference, here's some old articles posted by respawn on the principles of matchmaking in the game\n\nJan 2023 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/matchmaking-2023\n\nsome of the ranked dev blogs on the old systems and current system which also contain some information on ranked matchmaking\n\nS13 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/saviors-ranked-update\n\nS17 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-ranked-2023-update\n\nS18 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/july-2023-ranked-dev-blog\n\nS19 https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/17a41s1/dev_team_update_ranked_october_2023/\n\nS20 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-patch-notes and https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1ajjwff/apex_legends_season_20_breakout_early_information/\n\n---\n\nAt least for the time this thread stays stickied (~ this week), discussion of these topics should be concentrated here rather than individual posts (as per our rules).",

            "input based matchmaking is literally the one and only thing i want for this game right now, at the very least in ranked mode which is supposed to be competitive.",
            "It feels like they did the same thing to matchmaking, which made a lot of people quit the game at season 18-19. Every enemy in lobby was back then, and at the beginning of this season - is an ALGS multiple predator XTTV Aceu level opponent. I die to either one clip, 2 pump, or, the cherry on top this season - 3 tap by wingman. By almost every enemy. Before i would consider a good game with 5-9 killz, and with randoms i was able to get at least 1 win per 2 hours. This season getting even one kill is a miracle, and ive gotten one trios win in 5 HOURS! Because of that, i decided to stop playing again. No point of \"playing\" when all you are doing is dying to impossible enemies. Because of how competitive they are, everyone is playing super safe, hiding, camping, not pushing. Fights turn into ALGS stalmates untill one side run out of med through constant poking. Often intead of fighting, we decide to rotate to zone safely. IN PUBS!!! Because as soon as you approach any fight - you instantly die. And i havent even tried solos, because have seen multiple clips of enemies there being even more horrendous, and even teaming. Respawn should revert their SBMM changes and make lobbies actually playable again. Untill then, theres no point in suffering.",
            "I would very much like to have input based matchmaking for at least a few weeks to see how the queue times and games go. Could finally implement input lock as well while were at it",
            "Mixtape matchmaking is so insanely strict, it's genuinely unreal how every lobby I play is just controller stackers... I guess this is my reward for being decent at the game. Surely IBMM is feasible in mixtape atleast, as you only need 12/18 players.",
            "Add the option to enable/disable Crossplay and enable/disable Input-Based Matchmaking.",
            "Gripe 400: blocked a guys EA account one game because he was a terrible teammate get him as a teammate the next game lolll. Are these things on my screenshot just colors for show? Or do the words actually mean something?",
            "Currently the biggest issue is that massive bottleneck in plat 4. Soloing out of there is a pure hell. You will get all kind of players because of how easy it is to get plat, but there is that -60 showstopper. And your randoms will just hot drop you with 5 other teams, becasue they have completely given up on the climb and are just bouncing between gold 1 and plat 4 the entire season. I got to plat 2 today and the games have been unironically easier, because all of a sudden I am matched with good players that use mics and play for rp. Sure, some cheaters and some cracked premades, but having actual teammates that don't troll drop, use good guns and talk is a huge difference.",
            "Matchmaking is a pile of garbage. It throws you into the hardest lobbies and then it seems to adjust your next 20 games based on how bad you get shit on each game. Eventually you end up in a bot lobby and win the match. Then its back to awful lobbies again. It's 100% retention based matchmaking and its complete shit. You play to get better but the more you play the more you get put in unfair lobbies. You are literally punished for queuing up again.",
            "I was thinking of posting an alternative ranking system as an idea struck me yesterday. The main problem with Ranked is rank does not represent ability. You can get people at almost any level who can't play the game. You have teammates who run and rat and leave you a two man squad. It was extremely frustrating the other day where me and a capable random second were paired with a clear novice (in terms of ability) twice in a row. In one match, we landed sensibly with one other team, he and I took down two of them and messed the third up, and our unscathed third was slowly looting instead of running in to finish them. They reset and crushed him. \n\nA different approach is needed to awarding points so that people who can't play don't score many points and don't progress to higher ranks, and the way to rank up is to get good. Those who struggle with loot choices and combat will find challenging and rewarding matches fighting against like able players, while those of us who can play but aren't god tier get teams that play together, and those who can play god tier aren't left feasting on lower abilities. There's Trios for that wider level of competition.",
            "SBMM needs fixing, even in mixtape i face 4k 20 bombs. Mixtape is supposed to be fun and for warming up to some people. Personally it feels more competitive then ranked right now"

You may even have a small chance to obtain a Blue or Purple kitted weapon! Unfortunately, Tridents are too small to squeeze a fourth on board, but let \u2018em walk. If you\u2019re more of a team player, there\u2019s always Evac Towers or Valkyrie\u2019s Ult. And Skyward Dive, along with other Legend abilities, have also been updated to support a fourth.\n\n\n#COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS\n\nhttps://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/double-take-collection-event/double-take-skins-blog-v1.mp4\n\nFirst things first: direct unlock is back.

No need to opt-in. Everyone who has already achieved a rank this season is auto-eligible.\n\nYour Ranked Rumble placement will have no impact on your RP or Ranked Season placement or rewards. Those are locked in before the Ranked Rumble becomes available. How will YOU stack up against everyone else in your Rank?\n\n\n#PATCH NOTES\n\n**BALANCE UPDATES**\n\n**Care Package**\n\n- Purple light mag added\n\n**Gold Weapons Rotation**\n\n- Nemesis Burst AR, Triple-Take, Peacekeeper, Prowler PDW, Longbow DMR\n\n**End Rings**\n\n- End rings now have more even distribution through the map\n\n- Each quadrant of the map now have roughly 25% chance of getting selected\n\n**Survival Slot Items**\n\n- Survival slot items have been redistributed to low tier loot zones\n\n*Dev Note: Survival slot items were not spawning in all our loot quality zones. This adjustment maintains a similar number of survival slot items in a match but more evenly distributes them across the map.*\n\n**WEAPONS & ATTACHMENTS**\n\n**G7 Scout**\n\n- Damage increased to 33 (was 32)\n\n- Rate of fire increased\n\n- Adjusted recoil to be more consistent when firing at max fire rate\n\n*Dev Note: The G7 has felt a little underwhelming and our data backs that up. When we were evaluating its rate of fire we realized its recoil could use a pass as well so we\u2019ve smoothed out what we think the roughest spots are and given it a little more damage. This should help the G7 be competitive with the rest of our marksman and sniper roster.*\n\n**Havoc Rifle**\n\n- All mag sizes reduced\n\n    - No Mag: 20 (was 24)\n\n    - White Mag: 24 (was 28)\n\n    - Blue Mag: 28 (was 32)\n\n    - Purple Mag: 32 (was 36)\n\n*Dev Note: The Havoc is a force to be reckoned with, even without all the bells and whistles of mags and turbochargers it still puts in work. However, 36 rounds in a kitted Havoc, even with the firing delay, represents high damage up time and forgiveness for wasted rounds (often experienced during prefiring). Pulling back on mags allows it to remain deadly, but requires a little more precision.*\n\n**Longbow DMR**\n\n- Headshot multiplier increased to 2.25 (was 2.15)\n\n**R-99 SMG**\n\n- Reduced hip-fire randomness \n\n*Dev Note: Over the last few patches we nerfed the R-99 because it was a significant outlier, performing well above the rest of the pack. Those nerfs were substantial and the R-99 has fallen a little too far for our liking and is feeling unreliable. These adjustments intend to bring up its consistency without directly increasing its damage potential.*\n\n**Rampage LMG**\n\n- Firing animation has less vertical movement while in ADS\n\n**Weapon Rarity Sets**\n\n- Peacekeeper (Blue and Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 1x Hcog (was 2x Bruiser)\n\n- Charge Rifle & Sentinel (Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 4-8x (was 2-4x)\n\n    - Gunrun will keep a 2-4x\n\n**4x-10x Digital Threat Scope**\n\n- Will no longer provide threat vision through smoke or gas\n\n**LEGENDS**\n\n**Alter**\n\n- Void Passage: Crypto EMP will now affect all players phased by the Void Passage\n\n**Bangalore**\n\n- Smoke Launcher: all players within smoke will now have a white highlight visible to other players in smoke within 20m\n\n*Dev Note: Fighting inside Bangalore's smoke has never been a pleasant experience for players or viewers (aside from you Bloodhounds) as it makes fights messy and hard to read. We are leveling the playing field now by making all players inside smoke clearer targets to one another with a white highlight. This highlight is not visible from outside the smoke: all of the rotational and sight-blocking gameplay are kept in-tact. However, while playing inside the smoke will be more clear, it will also be more risky and resets will be much harder if the smoke is challenged.*\n\n**Bloodhound**\n\n- Beast of the Hunt: threat vision is no longer visible through smoke or gas\n\n- Upgrade: Level 2\n\n    - Raven\u2019s Blessing: Ult charge reduced to 20% (was 25%)\n\n- Upgrades: Level 3\n\n    - NEW Sighthound: reduced Tac cooldown by 50% while Ultimate is active\n\n    - NEW Flock: remove enemy range requirement for White Raven spawns\n\n*Dev Note: Sometimes even the best teams break up and go their separate ways. Bloodhound's Ult has always had a strong synergy with Bangalore\u2019s smoke, but the pairing has recently become dominant and a singular answer to the \"can't see stuff\" meta. With the removal of threat vision through smoke, Bloodhound will need to rely on their Tac scan like other Recon Legends. This should remove the necessity for the dynamic duo to pair together and allow for new roster compositions to form in its wake.*\n\n*We were noticing how much the White Raven passive would fall off in the late game as enemies are naturally closer, making Raven\u2019s Blessing upgrade much less valuable after the first ring. The new Level 3 upgrade will allow players to play off White Ravens across the match and fuel their Ult more effectively.*\n\n*Alternatively, players can now tap back into some of Bloodhound\u2019s old scan potential while in their Ult. These changes aim to shift power away from simply securing knocks for late game benefit and into more opportunities to use the Ult or the Tac through new upgrade choices.*\n\n[see full table of updated perks on original article]\n\n**Pathfinder**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Down & Away: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**Revenant**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Grim Leaper: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**MAPS**\n\n- PUBS: Broken Moon / Kings Canyon / Olympus\n\n- RANKED: Broken Moon / Olympus / World\u2019s Edge\n\n\n**MODES**\n\n**Quads**\n\n- Replacing Duos Playlist for S21.1\n\n- 15 Teams of 4 Players\n\n- Loot Improvements\n\n    - Chance to find Blue/Purple kitted weapons\n\n    - Increased ammo in Light, Heavy, and Energy ammo boxes\n\n    - Increased chance to find ammo, health, shield, scopes, and deployable items\n\n    - Increased Replicator starting count 12\u219215\n\n- Lobby supports a 4th player for inviting and \u2018Previous Match Squad Members\u2019\n\n- Legend Ability updates to support a 4th squad member\n\n    - Mirage Decoy shows 4 squad members when dropping from the dropship\n\n    - Valkyrie\u2019s Ult allows for up to 3 additional squad members to attach\n\n    - Vantage Passive can spot the armor on all enemy teammates when in ADS\n\n    - Loba\u2019s Ultimate has UI to support a fourth player\n\nNOTE: Quads is the only mode that supports queueing with 4 players. All other modes will be locked\n\n**Solos**\n\n- LTM - 7/9-7/22\n\n**Mixtape**\n\n- Lockdown: added The Core, Estates\n\n- Mixtape Map Rotations\n\n    - 6/25-7/8 Control: Caustic, Labs, Thunderdome / Gun Run: Estates, Fragment, Zeus Station / TDM: Habitat, The Core, Estates\n\n    - 7/9-7/22 Control: Labs, Caustic / Gun Run: Estates, Fragment / Lockdown: The Core, Estates / TDM: Habitat, Phase Runner\n\n    - 7/23-7/29 Control: Labs, Caustic, Production Yard / Gun Run: Estates, Fragment, Zeus Station / Lockdown: The Core, Thunderdome, Estates / TDM (removed during 1st week of LTM)\n\n    - 7/30-8/5 Control: Labs, Caustic / Gun Run: Estates, Fragment / Lockdown: The Core, Estates / TDM: Habitat, Phase Runner\n\n\n**RANKED**\n\nRanked Rumble takes over the normal Ranked League at the end of the season as the singular Ranked offering. Ranked entry cost, placement, and KP tuning updated to:\n\n- Lower entry cost above Bronze Tier\n\n    - Gold: 35 (was 40)\n\n    - Platinum: 55 (was 60)\n\n    - Diamond: 75 (was 80)\n\n- Placement RP Tuning now follows ALGS rules that all Top 15 will gain points\n\n    - 15th: 5 (was 0)\n\n    - 14th: 5 (was 0)\n\n- Kill Point Tuning\n\n    - 8th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 7th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 6th: 16 (was 12)\n\n*Dev Note: we have received valuable insights from last season's data and community feedback and made slight adjustments based on both. The entry cost above Bronze has been lowered slightly, all of the Top 15 players will now receive corresponding placement points, and increased the KP for players in the top 6th-8th positions. With the potential for more updates to come as we continue to monitor.*\n\n*We reward players for excellent strategic choices in placement and for outstanding combat performances in Kills. Achieving Top 5 placement in many ways is your strategic choice, but we won't reward you with additional points; you must validate your placement with eliminations.*\n\n\n**BUG FIXES**\n\nLooking for something else? Check out our public Trello board. It\u2019s updated weekly with the status of bugs that we can talk about ahead of the patch note drops. We also update our game status here for those of you not on other social platforms.\n\n- 3030-Repeater will no longer swap to a different reticle when reloading\n\n- Evo Harvester icons will no longer appear incorrectly for those who reconnect/connect late to a match\n\n- Firing Range: Dynamic Stats will now record some weapons properly\n\n- Fixed exploit that allowed players to move faster than normal\n\n- Mythic Melee items will now display their respective names in Death recaps\n\n- Nessies will no longer be occasionally extremely bouncy\n\n- Players will no longer be able to shoot enemies while safe behind cover\n\n- Resolved instances where some text displayed the old Replicator icon\n\n\n**GRAPHICS**\n\n- DX12 PC: Fixed many bugs that to help resolve crashes\n\n- Fixed an issue with flickering FX on Xbox One, especially lens flares and glows\n\n- Fixed bug that caused high polling rate mice to occasionally encounter high frame stutters.

It'd be perfect if it was a 2-6x or 2-8x, becoming the only scope to useable at two extremes... it has to the most useless legendary pick up in the game, 10x vs 8x makes no difference and I prefer the blue 6x or basic 2x compared to 4-8x.",

If smoke still disables Aim assist, then we now have Bang with wallhacks on her smoke, with double time to make it harder to hit at close range and enemies with diminished aim on controller. while a MnK Bang has literally all his aim plus wallhacks.... This sounds like an incredible unintentional buff.",

            "Believe it or not, the very first collection event did actually make you buy all the collection cosmetics *and* then spend *more* coins on unlocking the heirloom as the final item!",
            "I just dont get why they cant throw players a bone. Not getting even a single free event pack is just crazy to me. \n\nThe whales are gonna buy it all regardless, and most average players are not gonna spend $20+ on more coins to purchase a single pack from these events if they dont already have the requisite metals/coins. Theres no secondary market for skins like there is in a game like Dota or CSGO, so theres not even an argument for restricting supply.",
            "The word \"**free**\" is just a marketing tactic to bait people.",
            "This has always been the case. And yes its free because you only pay for the 24 event items, after the event its 150 shards",
            "They could easily make heirlooms actually earnable. Get 1000 kills with bloodhound get the bloodhound axe useless devs as always",
            "I understand that. It's just the wording of is humorous. Like respawn is doing you a favor after you pay for all of that.",
            "Can't discern whether this is satire or sarcasm."
