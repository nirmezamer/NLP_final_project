            "I\u2019m not a too big fan of it. Some good sections but it lacks an actual melody at all. Like not everything needs to be melodic but this could certainly use one.",
            "im surprised this has a worse reception than ice age. I luv rappin trav but ice age didn't do it for me he went on & on & on & nothing notable happened, i was happy others liked it tho\n\nThis however has him switchin it up, cool flows & i luv the part (is it called a bridge?) at 2:05\n\nIs there no music vid? I thought there was.",
