            "Ya now that you mention it I can kinda see that. There is definitely a possibility he likes coyote brown but we might need more information to know for certain. (Coyote is sick)",
            "Good luck with that man,\nThe only thing i would change about the magnetix belt however is flip one set of the magnets so they dont attach to the wrong one.",
            "I do indeed like coyote brown but it is ranger green. The lighting does make it look different in the picture however. (Coyote is still sick though)"

I have several rifles but this is my baby that I\u2019ll put thousands of more rounds through than anything else I own. I\u2019m gonna put more time aside to train. Right now I only train 4 hours a day 3 days a week (I\u2019m a busy civi). Also thx @ the people in this sub who helped me learn about rifle lights. Went with the Arisaka 18650, PLHv2 head, & DS-SR07 tail cap with modbuttons. Waiting on approval for my 30 cal hux can since June 5th. Sly tactical slings are amazing btw. \n\nAlso this aero precision 45 safety is the most tactile safety I\u2019ve ever had. U can switch to 90 if u want. \n\nALSOOO IF THINGS LOOK WEIRD ITS BECAUSE IM A LEFTY :(",

So here it is. \n\nPC: condor(what model I\u2019m not sure)\n\nPlates: Ar500 with premiere body armor spall liners\n\nSmall horizontal pouch on PC: Onetigris tactical pouch \n\nLarge pouch on plate carrier: wynex? (Off of Amazon)\n\nJacket: UFpro tactical winter jacket(the model shown I don\u2019t believe is available anymore)\n\nPants: UFpro ULT combat pants ATACS\n\nBoots: salmon x forces \n\nI wish I would have invested in a better plate carrier. I saw some really boujie ones out there and they def looked a lot more user friendly and comfortable. Overall all my gear worked out well. I don\u2019t recommend using tourniquets off amazon though. That cheap shit from china is crap. Just spend the money and get a CAT. Especially if it\u2019s for your family. Also I really don\u2019t have much else people to show these pictures too that I think would truly appreciate so I thought you guys might. Thanks for all your comments and love. Doing what I did had a huge impact on some people I loved so getting the good graces from you guys eased the demons a bit. Thank you all and Godspeed. \n\n",
