            ">Gosnells Mayor Terresa Lynes released a statement saying the city was acutely aware of the importance of protecting the wetlands, which were viewed as the \"jewel in the crown\" of the area's natural environment.\n\n>Ms Lynes said the state government had zoned the land surrounding the wetlands for industry **and the city was just trying to bring its local scheme into alignment \u2014 which was a legal requirement.**\n\n>She said rezoning the land would enable effective planning control to be put in place, and this would include significant buffers to protect the wetlands.\n\nWhat's the legal requirement? \n\nMy understanding is that the state can basically put a wet towel over any development by placing a restriction on the land use, but that's not some sort of suicide pact with the local government saying that they have to use it - its just that the state doesn't have a restriction for its use.\n\nAm I wrong?",
            "Well it's either industrial or housing, the land will never be let idle when they can collect rates on it.",

            "We had no rain for months, dead trees everywhere, climate change is going to hit us like a brick, and yet government is filling in wetlands. We\u2019re so fucked.",
            "The other way around actually, the WA Planning Commission can bypass the need for council approvals or restrictions for developments that the state feels will be a long-term benefit. e.g. local jobs, growth, housing, money etc. so it would behoove the city to rezone the area for development rather than making more red tape for the state government in case they change their minds.",
            ">This is one of the precious few ecosystems like this in Perth. Easily up there with the likes of Kings Park but very different.\n\nNot to hate on Kings Park (because it is lovely), but from an ecology standpoint its not that precious. The restoration works on it have been a \\~30 year affair, up until that point it was 'just' an urban park. There was even a proposal to build a friggin' Olympic sized swimming pool in it (although that was in the 50s).\n\nProbably a comparable area to the wetlands would be Bold Park, which has pretty much always been managed urban bushland (and also a quarry for a bit). It also has the advantage of being less frequented and with better closed off pedestrian areas.",
