            "I lost my orange baby a few days ago and I'm  upset over it, he was my world. It still doesn't feel real he was such a loving cat\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvegsfmw73xc1.jpeg?width=972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e719bd7a707c3f5feefdac965992ccc88362ff7b",

He's unfortunately reached the end of his road as of today. He's lost use of his hind legs, and cant hold food down. Were gonna miss the old man around here.",
            "I have a question for the mods. What if my cat passed away 3 years ago? My cat Sephy was a white cat with orange spots who was in my care from 2012-2021. Can I still post pictures of him here? If not, it's okay.",

I'm still heartbroken without him, and I still find myself doing things automatically as if I still have a cat (shutting doors, looking for him when I open my door, expecting him to find the one plastic bag in the entire place for him to nestle inside of, etc). ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",
            "My orange babygirl will be cross the rainbow bridge tomorrow. She's such a unique sunbeam. I'm going to miss so much, I'm so heartbroken. She's a tripawd kitty and that has done so well to live to 13 after being run over at 5. She has a scratchy meow, and biggest 'puss in boots' eyes. She's been so pampered and loved that she has been an absolute sasssssball with me her whole life. From waking me up by tapping my eyelids to meowing more than any other cat I've known. The last few weeks have been so hard as she was diagnosed out of the blue with cancer, and I know after tomorrow there's going to a loss that will never leave. But I also want to make sure celebrate what a cat she's been. Please send lots of love.

            "I don\u2019t know when it will happen due to the holiday weekend, but soon my lifelong friend, Bernard, who I have had since I was 10, will be departing this world. It hurts like Hell. I\u2019ve had him since I was 10, and now I\u2019m a week from 25. His body has started failing him recently. He\u2019s limping, having trouble using the litter box, he\u2019s blind in one eye, and starting to lose his appetite. I hate the fact vet clinics are closed on weekends around here. I don\u2019t want him to be in pain. Dammit Bernie, this is the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done to me. Please send your prayers, both he and my family need them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jyv1dio9ng2d1.jpeg?width=785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd1b7ca572e144e445a322efbfc34b07ad9c5195",

I really cannot imagine being without him. He maybe didn\u2019t ever fully utilize the orange braincell, but he is and shall remain a good kitty.",

He was found on the streets, running with ferals, and taken in to a shelter at age 13. I asked for the cat who needed a foster home the most, so he came home with me. After three placements fell through, I adopted him myself. He had kidney disease, needed his teeth taken out, and his immune system was wonky because of FIV. They told me he might be a hospice foster, but he lived three happy years with me. He was just so determined to enjoy life. He loved eating, he loved snuggles, he loved everyone. He climbed up to our shoulders and purred in our ears. He charmed the vet, he charmed people who said they didn't like cats, he even charmed my grumpy old lady cat Christy who never liked another cat in her life. He lived to be 16 years old. He was euthanized a week ago today, because his immune system was attacking his bone marrow, causing severe anemia. It happened quite suddenly. I almost think he held on as long as he could, because he wanted to enjoy life and stay with us; and then when he couldn't, he just let go. A life well lived. I have so many happy memories.",

He was the absolute best boy. He loved to roll on his back for belly rubs and would give me endless kisses while we sat in the front yard. I\u2019m lucky and honored to have been chosen by him. I tragically lost him 2 years ago and I never got to say goodbye \ud83d\ude14 I miss him so much and I hope he knows how much I loved him."
