Complaints, criticism, and snide remarks are also on the table, so have at it!\n\n**Topic starter ideas:**\n\n* What do you want to see more of/less of on r/electrical?\n* Are there any rules/enforcement you think would be helpful?\n* Ideas for better organizing posts/tags/user flairs?\n* Are there any weekly/monthly megathreads you'd like to see? Maybe a \"Dumb Questions I'm Afraid to Ask,\" \"Ask About Careers,\" or something similar\n* We've always been quick to remove *overtly* vulgar or attacking comments, but other than those, SPAM, and any deadly recommendation comments that get mass reported or a mod happens to see, we've mostly let the community self-organize. Is that working?\n* Do you prefer a fun/entertaining/light-hearted vibe in the sub, or do you want a more serious and no-frills approach?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/1dr8mt1/question_about_a_supposed_generator_setup/",
        "content": "So, bought this house a couple of years ago, past homeowners told me that this panel was meant for a generator plugged on a cable that is in the garage. Never thought too much of it, but now I've got a generator and want to make it work. However, I'm not sure how this thing is supposed to work, and if it does work like I think it does, it seems really dangerous..\n\nThe generator is going into a small panel with two 30amp breaker with an interlock, both can't be on at the same time ( Although, for current to flow through they would need to be ?? ), One breaker has the generator, the other is labeled as main source and is going inside of the main panel on a breaker that has no interlock with the main breaker, again, this seems like it could be a bit dangerous if both are on at the same time..\n\nHow's that supposed to work ? If I turn on the generator and open the right breaker in the small panel, the current still wouldn't flow to the main panel anyway since the other breaker will be off because of the interlock..\n\nThey told me it was installed by a certified electrician when we bought the house, but I'm having lots of doubt as of now to be honest. Can someone clear that up for me ?\n\nHere's a pic of the setup:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2qvflz7ath9d1.jpg?width=3648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0495695ca0c7880167a76d0a04b844b05ee2a7f9\n\n",

            "So its set up to power the whole panel which is the way I have mine. I turn off big amp draws  before I start my generator",
            "Wouldn't that require both breakers in the small panel to be on at the same time ?",
            "The way it is wired now, no circuits will be powered from the generator.  Change the small panel to another Square D type QO panel and you can use the same interlock and breakers in the new panel.  Move some circuits from the main panel into the new generator panel.",
            "Sorry I missed that. Yes thats the intention. The interlock should be in the main panel for this to work  if it is a hook up for the generator with the intention to power the panel. The generator breaker should be up near the main so you could have that interlock set up. So that sub panel makes no sense as it will never be able to send power to the house panel box   I ran my gen wire straight to my panel without the disconnect. I will change that one day. I take the breaker in the off position. My way is the wrong way",
            "And if i'd rather power the whole panel, I would need to move the 30 amp breaker in the main panel up top, add an interlock between the 200amp and the 30 from the generator and either remove the interlock in the small panel and flip both on when needed, or plug the generator cable directly in the main panel to the 30amp that was moved up top, right ?",
            "Yes.  Check out Interlockkit.com for a kit for your panel if the manufacturer doesnt offer one.  Look on the label inside the main panel to see if a part number is given for an interlock kit.",
            "That would make sense. However the past homeowners told me they used this panel to power the main one, which lead me to think they might have added the interlock in order to pass inspection when they were selling, but could've been using it without it and bring current straight to the main panel by flipping both breakers on, which seem a bit dangerous. Maybe worth mentionning, every time I touch something electrically related in this house, I find stuff that should never be done but they did anyway... I wouldn't be surprised if that's how they did it really.\n\n  \nThe front panel of the small one does not allow more then those two 30amp.. which leads me to think I can't really put separate circuits in there ?",
            "The wiring for the generator panel seems okay with the interlock.  However, there doesnt appear to be any circuits in the generator panel to be powered by the generator.  In addition to the two main breakers in the generator panel, there should be some branch circuit breakers for circuits that you want powered by the generator such as the heating system or a well pump.  Circuits such as those would get removed from the main panel and put into the generator panel.\n\nI have installed this generator panel a few times and wrote an article about it with photos.",
            "So I was right to assume that, if the past homeowner did use it to power the main panel, they probably removed the interlock in the small panel and ran in it an unsafe way as it would work, but could be a problem if both the main and the generator were to run at the same time. I'd rather do it safely than take the risk, I'll look into an interlock kit and getting someone qualified to move the breakers around."
