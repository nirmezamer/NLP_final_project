Complaints, criticism, and snide remarks are also on the table, so have at it!\n\n**Topic starter ideas:**\n\n* What do you want to see more of/less of on r/electrical?\n* Are there any rules/enforcement you think would be helpful?\n* Ideas for better organizing posts/tags/user flairs?\n* Are there any weekly/monthly megathreads you'd like to see? Maybe a \"Dumb Questions I'm Afraid to Ask,\" \"Ask About Careers,\" or something similar\n* We've always been quick to remove *overtly* vulgar or attacking comments, but other than those, SPAM, and any deadly recommendation comments that get mass reported or a mod happens to see, we've mostly let the community self-organize. Is that working?\n* Do you prefer a fun/entertaining/light-hearted vibe in the sub, or do you want a more serious and no-frills approach?",

        "content": "I live in an older apartment. Not quite sure how old it is exactly but everything in my area is historic. A couple of weeks ago, an apartment two floors down from me caught fire. There is a video showing the breaker box smoking and little balls of fire falling from it. We\u2019ve been told it could\u2019ve been caused by an overloaded outlet or exposed wires touching in the wall. The fire spread to all four apartments below us and now we\u2019re the only ones left in the building. I heard from a neighbor in the building next to us that the head of maintenance asked them to feel their breaker box once in a while to see if it\u2019s getting hot. I don\u2019t know how anything electrical works in buildings so I have no clue what to even make of that. I noticed when we moved in that the lights would flicker when I use my bathroom outlet. I know hair dryers can have some issues with flipping breakers and making lights flicker but the strange part to me is it isn\u2019t just from plugging it in. It flickers when I move the hair dryer (or whatever is plugged in) around. Besides when Im plugging it in, it doesn\u2019t flicker unless I\u2019m moving it. As I was plugging in my tv just now in my bedroom I noticed the lights flickered when I plugged it in, which I hadn\u2019t noticed before but I started unplugging everything every time I left my apartment after the fire happened. I guess this is the first time I\u2019ve plugged it in since then. An electrician came and inspected our beaker box. He said he didn\u2019t see anything serious but had pictures he needed to send with a report to maintenance. This was a few days ago and I haven\u2019t heard anything since. I\u2019m going to let maintenance know but it\u2019s Saturday so I don\u2019t want to bother them with something that may not be a problem. I\u2019m really worried and stressed about the safety of my pets while I\u2019m away. Is this something I should take seriously? ",
