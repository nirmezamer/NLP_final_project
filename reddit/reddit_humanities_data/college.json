        "content": "**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread.**\n\nIf you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.\n\n2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.\n\n2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.\n\n**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**\n\n* Create an [FSA account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.\n\n* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.\n\n* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.\n\nDo not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",

            "My parents refuse to submit information for their portion of Fasfa so I put extenuating circumstance/can\u2019t provide information. When I submitted, it said I needed to contact my school. My school isn\u2019t being helpful whatsoever, they\u2019re actually being very rude. They said they will not consider helping me because my parents refusing to provide information isn\u2019t their problem. What do I do?",
            "I did the FAFSA this year and my EFC is like $176,503. Without my rich step-dad, my EFC would be around $9,873. The problem is that my step-dad won't help pay for my education (which after scholarships it's like $2,700) a semester because he straight up said to me \"Because I'm not your father\". Meanwhile me and my mother had to scrape almost all of our savings (and our money mind you) to pay my tuition bill, and if I drop out for a semester my tuition jacks up to $5,700 a semester. How on earth am I gonna get the financial aid I need? \n\nI'm in the state of Ohio and I attend Cleveland State University if that helps.",
            "I've been very sad and depressed for several months. My grandma died, I feel tired all the time, I find it difficult to speak with my friends, my body feels disgusting. All I have been doing is waking up, going to work, and immediately going to sleep or staying in bed. I signed up for the current semester a month ago. I've been going to classes for 2 weeks. I've been doing homework but have stupidly been neglecting my emails. I logged in to do homework today and found out that my schedule was deleted. I noticed I got an email from the business office Wednesday telling me that my schedule was in danger of being deleted because of my account balance. But the problem is that I can no longer find out what I needed to pay (I've never been knowledgeable about understanding financial aid stuff). I would probably be able to afford it though. I have a ton of homework to do but I can't even access it. What do I need to do to figure this out?",
            "Hello! I'm simply asking this on the behalf of my sister. \n\nShe is planning on moving in with her girlfriend after high school, who also lives with her own parents. When filling out FASA is it weird if her new address doesn't match the address of her mother/stepfather when it comes to the income aspect of things? I know this may be poorly worded, but I thought I'd give it a shot.",
            "Can you qualify for Pell grants if your are going less than part time?",
            "I accidentally started the 2021-2022 fafsa instead of the 2022-2023. Will that affect anything?",
            "My parents said if I move out they won't help me pay for college and they make too much so now I can't get any money for fafsa, and I've been filing taxes as an independent since I was 18 i am 22 now. What do I do?",
            "My pell grant has been reduced from around 10k to 872$ for this semester and next semester. I got unemployment last year due to the pandemic, is this why I am getting such a small amount from FAFSA? What can I do to obtain more financial aid?",
            "Does SAP (satisfactory academic progress) transfer to University after community college? I started college a while ago before I knew what I wanted and as a result I now have too many units so I don't meet the SAP requirements. I am transferring to a CSU next fall, will my SAP be restored since I meet all the other requirements and my unit requirements will change?",
            "My parents are unable or are completely unwilling to help give me their information so I can file fafsa. I have been asking them for years, they never budge. What can I do to get FAFSA? I am currently a dependent and have no way in hell of leaving any time soon due to my current income and bills. Are there any options for me outside of FAFSA if theres no way? I currently have a 3.85 GPA in Computer Science. I have tried applying for scholarships but I never get any response."

One day there was a natural disaster and most of the streets were flooded in the area. Turn up to class and there's less than 20 in the lecture hall. (Understandable given the flood) Prof come in, have a small, discussion like class instead of the usual, then writes down all the names.

One day I brought in big jugs of primary paint color and a toilet plunger. I set up in a corner of the studio and spend the rest of semester hurling the plunger at canvases as hard as I could.

            "Took my senior seminar class with only the professor and one other student! Usually senior seminar is all about turning in a big paper at the end of the semester but this professor argues that we already know how to do that, so we got to pick a topic (as long as there hadn\u2019t been a class on it already during our time on campus) and teach about it for a few weeks. I talked about policing in schools and my classmate talked about religion in schools. It was really fun and we always spent the first bit of class just talking since there wasn\u2019t too much to do. We still text and recently got coffee together!",
            "I had an Introduction to Computer Science class my first semester of college that was run by TAs; we were almost always dismissed earlier than the ending time for the course. My second semester of college, I had this education history class that never gave out any tests or quizzes. We basically had a chill class discussion with the professor each class session and completed a few simple assignments outside of class, easiest class I've ever taken.",

He also weirdly brings up child pornography or some weird addition of child talk into communication topics/theories. Also his exams are insanely difficult and about 90% of people in the class fail or do average.

And honestly, the college students don\u2019t really care that you\u2019re in high school, they just think you\u2019re smart. Besides, they\u2019ll probably be able to tell that you\u2019re high school age. Hope this helps",

            "I was in a dual enrollment program is high school so I totally understand where you are coming from! I agree with what others have said: You have just as much of a right to go as anyone else in the class (as long as the invitation was extended of course!) and if it comes up, don\u2019t feel pressured to lie. As long as you are friendly and all that, no one should have a problem with it, and they might think it\u2019s cool that you are getting ahead on college stuff. I found college to be a lot more welcoming than high school if that helps at all, and I never had any issues in any of my dual enrollment courses. Community college attracts all kinds of students on many different paths. You got this!",

I\u2019ve never had a poor encounter with my college peers and as long as you\u2019re not parading around the fact that ur a high schooler taking college classes you\u2019ll be treated like any other college student since you technically are one now!
