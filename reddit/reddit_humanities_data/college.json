        "content": "**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread.**\n\nIf you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.\n\n2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.\n\n2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.\n\n**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**\n\n* Create an [FSA account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.\n\n* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.\n\n* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.\n\nDo not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",

            "My parents refuse to submit information for their portion of Fasfa so I put extenuating circumstance/can\u2019t provide information. When I submitted, it said I needed to contact my school. My school isn\u2019t being helpful whatsoever, they\u2019re actually being very rude. They said they will not consider helping me because my parents refusing to provide information isn\u2019t their problem. What do I do?",
            "I did the FAFSA this year and my EFC is like $176,503. Without my rich step-dad, my EFC would be around $9,873. The problem is that my step-dad won't help pay for my education (which after scholarships it's like $2,700) a semester because he straight up said to me \"Because I'm not your father\". Meanwhile me and my mother had to scrape almost all of our savings (and our money mind you) to pay my tuition bill, and if I drop out for a semester my tuition jacks up to $5,700 a semester. How on earth am I gonna get the financial aid I need? \n\nI'm in the state of Ohio and I attend Cleveland State University if that helps.",
            "I've been very sad and depressed for several months. My grandma died, I feel tired all the time, I find it difficult to speak with my friends, my body feels disgusting. All I have been doing is waking up, going to work, and immediately going to sleep or staying in bed. I signed up for the current semester a month ago. I've been going to classes for 2 weeks. I've been doing homework but have stupidly been neglecting my emails. I logged in to do homework today and found out that my schedule was deleted. I noticed I got an email from the business office Wednesday telling me that my schedule was in danger of being deleted because of my account balance. But the problem is that I can no longer find out what I needed to pay (I've never been knowledgeable about understanding financial aid stuff). I would probably be able to afford it though. I have a ton of homework to do but I can't even access it. What do I need to do to figure this out?",
            "Hello! I'm simply asking this on the behalf of my sister. \n\nShe is planning on moving in with her girlfriend after high school, who also lives with her own parents. When filling out FASA is it weird if her new address doesn't match the address of her mother/stepfather when it comes to the income aspect of things? I know this may be poorly worded, but I thought I'd give it a shot.",
            "Can you qualify for Pell grants if your are going less than part time?",
            "I accidentally started the 2021-2022 fafsa instead of the 2022-2023. Will that affect anything?",
            "My parents said if I move out they won't help me pay for college and they make too much so now I can't get any money for fafsa, and I've been filing taxes as an independent since I was 18 i am 22 now. What do I do?",
            "My pell grant has been reduced from around 10k to 872$ for this semester and next semester. I got unemployment last year due to the pandemic, is this why I am getting such a small amount from FAFSA? What can I do to obtain more financial aid?",
            "Does SAP (satisfactory academic progress) transfer to University after community college? I started college a while ago before I knew what I wanted and as a result I now have too many units so I don't meet the SAP requirements. I am transferring to a CSU next fall, will my SAP be restored since I meet all the other requirements and my unit requirements will change?",
            "My parents are unable or are completely unwilling to help give me their information so I can file fafsa. I have been asking them for years, they never budge. What can I do to get FAFSA? I am currently a dependent and have no way in hell of leaving any time soon due to my current income and bills. Are there any options for me outside of FAFSA if theres no way? I currently have a 3.85 GPA in Computer Science. I have tried applying for scholarships but I never get any response."

The stereotype that polisci majors are stuck up has been half true for me. Some people are just rude and convinced they have the best and hardest major ever. A lot of them also voice very strong political opinions which is not really the point of political science. However, I've also met people who are the complete opposite of this stereotype. I find the people who are actually passionate about polisci are actually super down to earth and it's the people who only care about getting into high-paying government positions or law school that are condescending.",

            "I go to a nowhere university so this isn\u2019t from personal experience, but one downside I hear about a lot is how competitive extracurriculars can be at prestigious schools. At my school I basically had a research opportunity fall into my lap and became a club president because nobody else wanted the position. Sure, it\u2019s not as impressive on a resume coming from my school as it would be coming from Harvard, but at least I get to do it.",
            "What's a gir?",
            "It's harder to stand out in class as a small fish in a big pond. You are surrounded by a lot of smart people you can learn from, but as a result, there is a lot of competition when it comes to doing research with professors, who are also at the top of their field and less willing to work with average students as they see it as an inefficient use of their time.",
            "I went to an Ivy. First, the competitive nature was legitimately too much, most everyone I know was on drugs (prescription and otherwise) to deal with the stress/anxiety as well as uppers to stay up and study for longer. The expectations were just completely unreachable and unrealistic. It\u2019s just that the highly competitive nature of the whole school made it seem that unless you had a perfect gpa and the perfect internship you weren\u2019t good enough to be there.\n\nSecond, the entitlement from a lot of people going there was horrific. I came from a severely underprivileged high school where the school didn\u2019t even have the resources to buy textbooks, so going from that to an Ivy was jarring. Most people at Columbia were relatively wealthy, and if you weren\u2019t, the school admin did not know how to help you. For example, my fianc\u00e9e, who was also a Columbia student, was working at a lab over the last summer and was paid in the form of a stipend. (This is a specific example of an issue that unfortunately reared its head over the course of my time at Columbia) The university gave her the run around every time she was supposed to get paid and did everything in their power to not pay her. It was ridiculous. It got to the point that we had to lawyer up for the university to actually pay her, and even then, the stipend was always at least a month late. When she called the university\u2019s financial department for the billionth time and insisted she needed the money for rent or she\u2019d be evicted, they just said \u201cOh.\u201d I ended up having to cover her rent with money I didn\u2019t have so she wouldn\u2019t be super late on rent (she later paid me back ofc) but the fact that something like that had to happen was ridiculous. We just figured that most people getting paid on a stipend might not necessarily need it, so when the university was met with a student that actually needed the money to live, they were genuinely surprised and didn\u2019t have anything in the way of help.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can tell from my rant I have a lot of grievances, but the ones I listed above are definitely the ones that bothered me most. I\u2019m glad to be graduated and away from that hell.",

What you actually get to experience is how mature students are when they opt to network with other fellow students.",
            "My friend goes to Stanford and I lived with him for a week so I feel I can say a little something. 99% of the conversations I\u2019d hear in passing were about classes or internships or some other way of  furthering their future careers. Which isn\u2019t bad but as an outsider it just seems like all of them are superficial on the surface and only think about that kinda stuff."
