There'd be nothing to learn from.\n\nJust because the headline of an article posted says security update is bogus or company name was hacked doesn't mean it's not a privacy issue. For all you know you just installed boot level signed malware so now you're never going to be secure **or private**. Or that the company did in fact lose a large portion of plaintext data even though the article says it was hacked.\n\nI agree on a case by case basis safe, secure, hacked should be removed, but generically categorizing and removing without context just hurts the end redditor. If the algorithm for a widely used 2FA was hacked tomorrow, I'd want to know about it because it affects privacy directly and even if you roll your own, you're no longer as private as you thought you were.\n\nI'll adhere to the sub rules obviously, but just my two cents on why just generically saying safe, secure, hacked shouldn't mean it's not about privacy.",

        "content": "My post relates very much to [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1cn6ps5/should_i_use_googles_find_my_device/) which is a month old. Like their Samsung device, this feature is now coming to my Redmi device also. Today only I received the email with subject, *\"Your Android devices will soon join the Find My Device network\"*.\n\nAs always, the **real** privacy nightmare stuff is always hidden in between the large boring paragraphs or the fine print as they say. Here is the part which I think is the most problematic: \n\n> How it works\n> \n> Devices in the network use Bluetooth to scan for nearby items. If other devices detect your items, they\u2019ll securely send the locations where the items were detected to Find My Device. *Your Android devices will do the same to help others find their offline items when detected nearby.*\n\nSo, your devices are also supposed to co-operate by sending data to other devices which may want their location detected while offline. We are made to believe here that this data pertains to only our location and nothing else but once this thing becomes too ubiquitous, one can easily see the scope for surveillance capitalism by the powers that be?\n\nThis is very much like the Microsoft's recall scenario, I don't see much difference between this and that. At least there the data is still on the user's device and doesn't leave its shores, this is arguably even worse. For such technology to be palatable to the power user, they must at the very least, be prepared to open source this code. I think recall would have still got some acceptance had Microsoft made the code open source. This whole \"you trust me bro but I won't trust you\" business is highly cynical and doesn't usually have a long shelf life.",

            "\n\nThere are two viewpoints:\n\nEither you trust Google enough that they don't use that data for tracking but just want to compete with Apple.\n\nOr you don't trust them, then you should at least opt-out but tbh should have switched to something like the popular alternative OS that exidts for Pixel Phones long ago.\n\nOh, and no, in no way near as bad as Microsoft Recall. Not even close.",
            "I just want to add a bit of nuance here. To start with, yes, Google is processing your location. If Find My Device is available to you, then you have a device with Google Location Services turned on. If you have that, then your device is already constantly talking to Google about everything it sees to provide you with a more accurate position. Find My Device does not change anything about that.\n\nNow the way this system works has actually been designed with privacy in mind. I'm talking from the finding perspective here. Obviously the trackers themselves are a privacy nightmare. But Google did put in effort to ensure that it's hard to track passive participants in the network.\n\nThat's because it will only show the location of a tag once it's been reported by a sufficient amount of different devices. It then shows an average of all those pings. That means you can find the location of the tag, but it's going to be very difficult to find out who was near it, where they were exactly or when. This does strike a balance between privacy and usefulness.\n\nNow you may not trust Google at all, in which case you should probably at the very least turn Google Location Services off. That is entirely fair. They've not exactly shown themselves to be particularly trustworthy. But if you do think that the trade-off is a fair one and you trust that it's implemented the way they say it is, then I would argue that this is a pretty solid design. And while it can be abused, it can also be very useful.",

I\u2019m not defending the product itself.",
            "Google already knows your location. Now it just also knows that devices that want to be found are nearby. It doesn't change anything for you as a user of Android.",
            "We can avoid *all* of this silliness by *not* having a google acct for starters.

We ask to have our privacy respected, instead we get (Sigh)*another* tracking vector because we *may* lose our effing phone? \n\nAll devices *interconnected*...to find *one*. 7 years ago, that would be cute. Now it's just creepy.\n\nSmarten up, keep bluetooth off...stop re-contributing to some strangers' server and yacht payments. Leave some mystery to who you are.",
