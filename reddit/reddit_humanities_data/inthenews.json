            "If immigration is so bad, why did they vote against the best solution to date?  So Biden can\u2019t get credit? Sounds like the orange turd has blood on his hands.  That\u2019s what the response should be. Don\u2019t hold back , be aggressive!",
            "Considering his many many many MANY many malfunctions when speaking solo with a teleprompter lately, I'd be absolutely shocked if he shows up. But hell he's managed to barely grit his teeth through a debate in the past by snorting just enough of something to keep his brain focused for at least part of it. It's obvious he's high as a kite when he does it but the network can't say that unfortunately. \n\n\nBut even if he shows and even if he's high enough to not babble about how hard it is to put in pants and which sharks he doesn't want to pet or whatever, Biden is going to be prepared for his basic level debate tactics. Oh no you plan to point out something bad happened during Biden's presidency? Hmm now is there anything bad that happened during convicted felon Trump's presidency? Maybe something that WAS actually a direct result of his decision that led to a million and counting unnecessary American deaths? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f If he wants to cherry pick negative consequences I'd be willing to bet Biden can play that game all night. Certainly can play it longer than whatever the felon snorted lasts.",
