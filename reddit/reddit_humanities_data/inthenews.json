            "I think part of this is due to the fact that the threat of trump becoming president again got very real during the debate. I think some undecided folks had a oh shit this is real moment.",
            "Trust no polls. Vote like its the last Presidential election well ever have, because this time theres an overwhelming chance it actually will be.",
            "I already knew Biden was old and Trump lies nonstop.   The debate didn't change my mind.",
            "Im still flabbergasted a convicted felon can be POTUS",
            "Who the fuck was still deciding?",
            "Remember 2016. Believe nothing any press says. Go vote blue.",
            "One thing I liked about this is that the expectations for the SECOND debate are extremely low.  If Joe shows up and can speak without freezing, he will get a boost.",
            "100% I'm taking sleepy grandpa with good ideas over deranged con man that wants to plunge the world into chaos.",
            "The thing getting lost in Joes stumbles is that all Trump did was energetically lie a fuckton again and do his normal brand of word salad bullshit. If people were looking for something new out of Trump to vote for him, they didnt find it either. Theyre back to either not voting at all or decided theyll go with Joe despite his faults, one of which is that he is not a CONVICTED FELON like Trump is now. This was a disaster for Biden but that just means he looks bad against the backdrop of being next to one of the worst candidates in the history of the country.",
            "They even abort babies after birth -Trump\n\nTells you everything about how Trump feels about women."

            "Me: I cant with a straight face say, Biden definitely has another four years in him.\n\nAlso me: Of course, Im voting for Biden in November.",
            "We keep normalizing Trump as legitimate and thats the first mistake. Hes committed so many crimes he should be in prison and barred from office, not made the frontrunner of a major party and given a free platform to spew his lies.",
            "I'm watching his campaign rally in NC...where was this guy last night??   Wtf",
            "I read the transcript first and was completely shocked when everyone said he did badly. Really shows how much delivery matters. It isnt just what you say its how you say it.",
            ">  But, reading the cold transcript, we get a very different picture of Biden. Substantively, he ably and forcefully made the case that that Trump should not be allowed back in the Oval Office.",
            " I'm realizing it is not about these two candidates but the VPs, the cabinet, and the Supreme Court that I am voting for.",
            "Exactly. Trump didnt even complete a single coherent statement.",
            "As old and frail as Biden appeared last night i dont think its going to make much of a difference come election day.\nIt certainly isnt going to change my mind.\nIt wasnt as if it wasnt obvious that everything that came out of Trumps mouth was a lie.",
            "This is the point Ive made repeatedly. If you actually listened to what he said and ignore the verbal stallouts, Biden talked about policy and made good arguments about why Donald Trump should not be President.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald dodged questions and ranted non-stop about the border."
