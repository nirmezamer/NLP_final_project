            "Hi, I'm going to be in Seattle next month from Monday around 430pm til Friday morning. It's a work trip so I have stuff going on during the day Tuesday and Wednesday, but I'm staying Thursday in hopes of making some fun memories with my 10 year old. She loves animals so I was thinking the zoo or the aquarium, and I was wondering how much time I should plan to do those. Hoping to fit something in Monday, but we'd be arriving too late for both those options. I was looking into CityPass, and I don't think we'll have time to utilize that, but the C3 Pass may be a good option.  Any recommendations for or against going on the harbor tour? That seems like the one option on there for Monday that fits my schedule. This is my first time planning a vacation on my own, so I'm pretty anxious I'm going to overlook some major details and I'd love some recommendations. Thanks in advance!",

Wondering if anyone has done this (regardless where from)?\n\nWanting to know if I get the dog before immigration/ customs? From the maps and memory there's a dog rest point upstairs before the baggage claim, so maybe I can take her there to let her out for a few minutes before queueing. Then assume she will be caged again to queue through immigration?\n\nI tried emailing SeaTac, possibly to no surprise there's no reply after a week.\n\nAnother question, is it ok to bring unopened dog food into US in checked baggage? I keep getting the tsa page which seems to be for domestic.",
