            "Looking for coffee shops or cafes between Seattle and Tukwila area to sit down and build some legos and catch up with a friend (so we need a table). TIA!",
            "Hey did you guys know that the CEO of Woodland Park Zoo (a non-profit) nets a half-a-million dollar a year salary while the people responsible for the care and health of the animals themselves make near poverty wages for the city of Seattle? That the keepers are understaffed and overworked, taken advantage because of their love and dedication to the animals by the administration? \n\nDisgusting",
            "Is there anywhere in the city that does professional hat cleaning/re-dyeing for baseball caps? I have a few irreplaceable hats that unfortunately my sweat seems to have permanently damaged. I tried the hat store in Pike Place but they told me they only do fedoras and the like.",
            "Anyone know any Seattle kids driving I90 out to the east coast (or Midwest) on their way back to college this fall, that have a roof rack? If so, please message me!",
            "Downtown is a 17 minute drive to there. Lots of options.\u00a0",
            "TSA doesn't care. Gummies would be pretty low risk unless you are flying internationally.",
            "No. Weed is still federally illegal.\u00a0",

            "You can say this about a lot of non-profits. Write to the Zoo's Board of Directors. I will say he's done a really good job...I'm not saying it's okay but at least he's not worthless."

            "they just ripped out a bunch of really beautiful old trees on washington street in pioneer square....   it looks so bleak now",
            "Hey now that land was cleared to build my house I don't want any more trees cut down or new homes or anything built dammit!",
            "What is the point of removing these trees?",
            "whoever doesnt fuck with trees in urban scenarios doesn't appreciate it until its HOT AF out. Trees can't speak for themselves, imagine dissing on a group of people (and other individuals) because we don't hear that some trees are getting killed.",
            "Someone drew a dick on this.",
            "I mean, it could also be due to it not being a residential area people weren't aware/ there was no one person to spear head the resistance",
            "Living out in the suburbs this is 100% true. You want to expand a road to give it a dedicated bus lane, but that requires someone to give up 5ft of land they'll complain about the trees you're chopping down. If they want to remove those same trees to have a better lake view or whatever and it's suddenly their property and they should be able to do so regardless of regulation.\n\nIf they actually cared about trees and the environment they'd be planting native plants and not having a huge green lawn that needs tons of water and chemicals to keep looking \"perfect\" as well as native trees in good locations around their homes.",
            "Over shitty cultivar landscape trees?  Go fight for the Davis-Meeker Garry Oak.  400 years old and on the historic register and the mayor of Tumwater wants to remove it.  Oh and it\u2019s got a mating pair of kestrels in it!",
            "I think that the tweeter should be expressing concern or opposition themself instead of saying that other people are ideologically inconsistent.",
            "I mean, I would be 100% down with the idea that any building project can get permission to tear out regular trees (within reason, certain historical trees should obvs be protected) so long as they are required (and actually fricking forced to follow through) to use native plant species in the landscaping (if that\u2019s part of the design) and to plant native tree species in a way that contributes to reforestation (it doesn\u2019t have to be on their property). Most of the new buildings have SOME sort of landscape architecture included in the project. Incentivize drastically reducing invasive species use and streamline the approval process (since you just look at the plan and go \u201cnative species? Plan for planting trees? Good to go here\u2019s your permit\u201d instead of bickering over specific individual trees). \n\nYOU CAN LIKE BOTH TREES AND EFFICIENCY"

That being said, I\u2019d like Seattle/ King County to take notes from NYC and get a decent metro system together before I die. Also more eateries, and late night stuff.\u00a0",

            "this is thrilling news for people who live in snohomish and drive into seattle once every three years",
            "So if it\u2019s illegal to be homeless, surely the government will ensure sufficient and affordable housing, right?",
            "As economic disparity increases so does the criminalization of poverty...",
            "This is just going to push more homeless people away from smaller towns and suburbs and toward larger cities that couldn\u2019t possibly enforce it. It will just create a bigger burden for cities like Seattle",
            "People in this thread are acting like it\u2019s some conservative conspiracy or the end of the world. This is great, if only because it\u2019s a change that maybe can drive things to get better. San Francisco, LA, and the Biden administration advocated for this to be overturned. They wanted greater flexibility in their ability to respond to homeless camps. I don\u2019t understand how anyone could look at the squalor or third world conditions of many of these homeless camps and convince themselves what we are doing is humane or just. To both the citizens in our region and the homelsss themselves.",

            "The handwringing in this post about this decision is interesting. Have you guys actually been paying attention the last six years? The 9th circuit has absolutely hamstrung West coast states. We had a world where West coast states had one set of rules and everyone else had another. Many larger, liberal cities tended to interpret Martin v Boise as \"you can never remove a homeless encampment unless you have shelter space for everyone\", which if you read the ruling itself, was clearly not what was intended, but oh well. So Seattle and King County just get to endlessly pour money into this out of the goodness of our hearts? How's that been going so far for us? At what point do we admit that our intentions aren't exactly lining up with actual outcomes?\n\nThere has to be some middle ground between \"we can't do anything\" and \"camping is illegal, go straight to jail\"."
