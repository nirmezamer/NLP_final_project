            "OP I will sticky this post to save us during the next days from daily posts asking the same question and also because in the top threads there are some good explanations on what the clubs are actually going to do and what not.",
            "Asking this question on Reddit is kind of cute.",
            "Couldn't care less as it has no consequences on my life.",
            "De-criminalization was long overdue. Although I enjoyed smoking weed time ago, it doesn't really fit my schedule nor lifestyle.\nLater on, when I can get my hands on some, I'll definitely enjoy not having to look over my shoulder not to alert anyone.",
            "I mostly enjoy the drama it causes among the conservatives but other than that I don't really care. Tried it a few times, wasn't for me so for myself there won't probably be much change. On the other hand it makes me happy for those who want to consume or grow because I really don't see a valid reason for banning it.\n\nSo overall I think it's a positive development, although we have much bigger issues to take care of.",
            "I can finally smoke without fearing for losing my career or driver's license. It's good to not be a criminal for choosing THC over alcohol.",
            "A) it was overdue, they should have legalized it long ago, finally they gained some sense \n\nB) it was done a typical german way which means the regulations are complicated and annoying and comical. Why cant we never do anything the simple way?",
            "I didn't expect a huge party bc those who smoke weed already do it. It's like the pineapple on a pizza: If you don't like it then don't eat it but don't ruin other people enjoyment.  \nThe Prohibition has failed miserably and just gave rise to a black market. By enabling people to supply themselves you are ruining sellers bc they are losing dedicated customers who are their main income source. It won't disappear completely but will take a massive hit.  \nI smoke some here and there but don't mind people doing it. Painting them as criminals is a very conservative take on society and it does not surprise me that the Bavarian government is so hardcore fighting this.",
            "Personally, I don't have the time to be high anymore, but I'm glad for the people who smoke a little weed every now and then to no longer be considered criminals. It's also cool that small time users can now generate their own supply rather than having to buy hopefully uncut weed from seedy people.\n\nHowever, I also see that the current model is lacking on several ends, not fixing enough problems (black market trade for example) and not taking enough opportunities (taxation for example). I hope it's more of an interim solution rather than a half-measure which will simply be repealed by a conservative administration at the end of the probational period in four years.",
            "Sehr gut. We don't need to criminalise people for the use of a (by comparison) harmless drug. Therefore I particularly like the amnesty for already existing criminal convictions. Sure, there'll be an initial additional work for the judicial system to work through the amnesty cases, but in the mid to long run we're not congesting the system with cases of people who just want to smoke a bit of cannabis by themselves/in an environment where it harms no one else."

            "In Germany, when we stub our toe, we don't say \"ouch\" we say: \"FUCK VERDAMMTE SCHEIE, WELCHER WICHSER HAT DAS SCHEI DING HIER HINGESTELLT?!\" and I think thats beautiful.",

            "I say \"Autsch\", which sounds almost exactly the same",
            "In addition to the other replies you can say \"Aueeee!\" When somebody caused the pain and you want to transfer a \"why did you do this\" into your ouch",
            "\"Au!\" Sounds very similar to \"Ow!\" or just an \"aaah\" sound\n\n\"Auaaa\" is the cry that German children make when they have been hurt and need consoling. It's also what you ask children: \"Hast du ein Aua?\" It's like the \"ouchie\" in English. \"Aua\" can be used by adults too but they'd pronounce it in a short, quick way, while children say the word in a \"wailing\" way. If you pronounced it in a way a child would pronounce it, you would be doing so in a humorous way.",

            "Straburg, Weienburg etc, Look exactly like German cities but with French street signs.",
            "Honestly, if you asked someone from Marseilles, they'd probably say Strasbourg looks suspiciously German and someone from Hamburg would rate Saarbrcken as almost French. Dresden looks more like Prague than like Cologne and Mnchen is the annoying little sister that tries on Vienna's clothes but just can't quite pull them off as well. The architectural zeitgeist and culture in central Europe was always a bit fluent so I couldn't really tell you if Ljubljana or Bratislava look \"German\" just because they were part of one of the German Empires, or whether it just looks, well, central European with some recognisably Habsburgish buildings.",
            "Lithuanian here but living in Germany. Klaipeda has few buildings that look completely German. There is also some building with plates saying hitler was here on. Other smaller cities on the side have some streets in German names or some of the houses (school for example) have Lithuanian and German name.",
            "Was in Qingdao about 15 years ago. They were kinda proud about their German heritage, but mostly as a distinction from the following Japanese occupation. The architecture from that period can clearly be identified. Tsingtao beer was founded by Haake Beck, but is no longer brewed as per German beer purity laws.",
            "It depends on what the conquerors have made of the city. Brnn for example is beautiful and appears to honor its heritage - apart from the murderous episodes at the end of WWII. The same is true for some cities in nowadays Poland - but Knigsberg and Eastern Prussia are just gone and eradicated.",
            "I've been to Prague, wich was a german city surrounded by czech villages up until the 19th century. In the old town you can clearly see the austrian influences still. I even saw an old pharmacy that was restored with golden german lettering. And since the czechs are culturally close to us the supermarkets and restaurants really reminded me of traditional german restaurants and shops. Good beer and an emphasis on potatoes and meat in the meals. Needless to say I enjoyed it.",
            "Windhoek, Swakopmund and Lderitz in Namibia still have a lot left from the former colonization period.",
            "Straburg looks pretty German from an architectural perspective, but people mostly speak French there. Yes, there is still lots of German influence of course and especially in the smaller villages near the city you can still find native German speakers. It felt good being there since Straburg is a beautiful city with a great food culture. It's a French city now and I am okay with it.",
            "Been to Szczecin (formerly Stettin) and it was pretty cool. It doesn't look entirely like a german city, especially their train station didn't. I guess that was the almost 80 years of polish and soviet influence to the infrastructure. But there was a lot that reminded me of cities in Northern Germany. \n\nI still liked it a lot."
