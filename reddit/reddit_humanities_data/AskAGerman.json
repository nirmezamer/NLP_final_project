            "OP I will sticky this post to save us during the next days from daily posts asking the same question and also because in the top threads there are some good explanations on what the clubs are actually going to do and what not.",
            "Mostly, they don\u2019t care, afaik. \nWeed is kinda legal now, but not for sale. You can own some, grow some, or join a weed club to gain a right to get weed from a club.",
            "Asking this question on Reddit is kind of cute.",
            "Couldn't care less as it has no consequences on my life.",
            "De-criminalization was long overdue. Although I enjoyed smoking weed time ago, it doesn't really fit my schedule nor lifestyle.\nLater on, when I can get my hands on some, I'll definitely enjoy not having to look over my shoulder not to alert anyone.",
            "I mostly enjoy the drama it causes among the conservatives but other than that I don't really care. Tried it a few times, wasn't for me so for myself there won't probably be much change. On the other hand it makes me happy for those who want to consume or grow because I really don't see a valid reason for banning it.\n\nSo overall I think it's a positive development, although we have much bigger issues to take care of.",
            "I can finally smoke without fearing for losing my career or driver's license. It's good to not be a criminal for choosing THC over alcohol.",
            "A) it was overdue, they should have legalized it long ago, finally they gained some sense \n\nB) it was done a typical german way which means the regulations are complicated and annoying and comical. Why can\u2019t we never do anything the simple way?",
            "People seem to forget that weed is a very potent medicin. I dont give a dim if people are smokin a joint or two. You cant die from using it. But we have 50 k people drinkin their asses to death. In Germany alcohol is and was glorified without end. I remember being drivin by schoolbuses with Oldesloer Korn (booze) commercials on it. A lot of sick people depend on cannabis as a medicin. It starts with sleeping problems and back ache and goes as far as cancer care.",
            "I didn't expect a huge party bc those who smoke weed already do it. It's like the pineapple on a pizza: If you don't like it then don't eat it but don't ruin other people enjoyment.  \nThe Prohibition has failed miserably and just gave rise to a black market. By enabling people to supply themselves you are ruining sellers bc they are losing dedicated customers who are their main income source. It won't disappear completely but will take a massive hit.  \nI smoke some here and there but don't mind people doing it. Painting them as criminals is a very conservative take on society and it does not surprise me that the Bavarian government is so hardcore fighting this."

            "Stra\u00dfburg, Wei\u00dfenburg etc, Look exactly like German cities but with French street signs.",
            "Honestly, if you asked someone from Marseilles, they'd probably say Strasbourg looks suspiciously German and someone from Hamburg would rate Saarbr\u00fccken as almost French. Dresden looks more like Prague than like Cologne and M\u00fcnchen is the annoying little sister that tries on Vienna's clothes but just can't quite pull them off as well. The architectural zeitgeist and culture in central Europe was always a bit fluent so I couldn't really tell you if Ljubljana or Bratislava look \"German\" just because they were part of one of the German Empires, or whether it just looks, well, central European with some recognisably Habsburgish buildings.",
            "I've been to Prague, wich was a german city surrounded by czech villages up until the 19th century. In the old town you can clearly see the austrian influences still. I even saw an old pharmacy that was restored with golden german lettering. And since the czechs are culturally close to us the supermarkets and restaurants really reminded me of traditional german restaurants and shops. Good beer and an emphasis on potatoes and meat in the meals. Needless to say I enjoyed it.",
            "It depends on what the conquerors have made of the city. Br\u00fcnn for example is beautiful and appears to honor its heritage - apart from the murderous episodes at the end of WWII. The same is true for some cities in nowadays Poland - but K\u00f6nigsberg and Eastern Prussia are just gone and eradicated.",
            "Stra\u00dfburg looks pretty German from an architectural perspective, but people mostly speak French there. Yes, there is still lots of German influence of course and especially in the smaller villages near the city you can still find native German speakers. It felt good being there since Stra\u00dfburg is a beautiful city with a great food culture. It's a French city now and I am okay with it.",
            "What would a typical polish or Czech city look like to you? Is Dresden German or does it look French because of the baroque influence? Freiburg and L\u00fcbeck look nothing alike. You could argue that Strasbourg looks German. But you could make the same argument that Nordhorn looks Dutch. You can argue that Krakow looks German. But Krakow and Strasbourg don\u2019t really look alike. What about Basel? Or Tours? Or Copenhagen? If you would want to, you could go all over the place and make the same argument. Does Frankfurt look German to you? It\u2019s just a load of chauvinist bullshit, because in essence it just means that people are walking around and saying \u201eThis used to belong to us.\u201c Not cool.",
            "I'm from Berlin, and I studied and worked in Breslau/Wroc\u0142aw for 3 years. \nIt's a tough question. \nNot many people I met in Wroc\u0142aw think about the German past anymore. People are aware of the city's history, but it doesn't have much influence on their daily lives. Many Wroc\u0142awians have a family history of forced relocation from former Polish territory that is Ukraine today, so that is part of their history, too. \nIn the past, an effort has been made to make the city Polish. There are only a few places where one can still see signs of the fact that the city was once German. For example, there are still German letters and words in some old churches.\nI was never a victim of anti-German sentiments. Quite the opposite. Polish people were happy to see a German learn their language and study and work in their city. \nI never really thought about Wroc\u0142aw as a German city, even though I was really interested in the history of the city. \nSome Germans stayed in Wroc\u0142aw after the Second World War. They are a minority now. They still have their own services at Church. \nI asked some Wroc\u0142awians if it is ok for Germans to call the city Breslau. Nobody ever had a problem with it. Wroc\u0142aw is really hard to pronounce for non-Poles :D",
            "Lithuanian here but living in Germany. Klaipeda has few buildings that look completely German. There is also some building with plates saying \u201chitler was here on\u2026\u201d. Other smaller cities on the side have some streets in German names or some of the houses (school for example) have Lithuanian and German name.",
            "Wroc\u0142aw and Gda\u0144sk were not renamed, they were known as such in Polish since medieval times.\n\nOn the topic of the thread- my wife who is German says that if we ever move to Poland she\u2019d like to live in Wroc\u0142aw, which runs me the wrong way since I\u2019m from Cracow (which is obviously a lot better duh)."
