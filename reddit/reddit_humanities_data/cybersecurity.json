            "Hey guys I managed to get two referrals for entry level roles but not sure what to do now. How would you guys approach this? Do i follow up somehow or? Suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",
            "Hello I\u2019m getting my bachelors in computer science but I hope to work in cybersecurity, what qualifications and certifications do I need?",
            "Hey all, I'm 31 and I've just recently finished a cybersecurity program at a local University. Looking to start my cyber career but having some trouble due to my lack of any IT experience. Did several labs and a cyber sim during my program but the lack of practical experience is holding me back.\n\nJust curious what projects/activities I should be looking at participating in to boost my resume given my lack of cyber/IT experience. Still looking for positions but this can be something I can work in the meantime. Thanks!",
            "I\u2019ve got 11 years xp in helpdesk and network engineer at an ISP. I just graduated with a cybersecurity degree with a bunch of certs. I haven\u2019t even come close to getting an interview anywhere. Unfortunately I live in a rural area (willing to relocate) and no direct xp for cybersecurity on my resume. Would pursuing a masters in cybersecurity help? I feel like without xp in the field it won\u2019t help at all. \nSide note, would there be any suggestions for someone in my position for getting an interview?",
            "I'm coming up on a due date to use a voucher for the GCP Architect exam.  Even with the Google training, Cloud Skills Boost, I'm not feeling confident.  My wife thinks it is because I failed a cert for the OWSP a few years ago and have lost my confidence.  \n\nAny suggestions on items to use to study, books, Udemy courses (work has a subscription). Then I trust my wife, anyone have any tips on dealing with loss of confidence?",
            "I have an issue and I\u2019m turning to the hive. I have a BA in CJ and my Master in Public Administration.  I\u2019m currently employed in the security world (non tech) for a large organization. I  have a budding interest in information technology and cybersecurity. I\u2019ve been self studying at a very basic level, A+, AWS Cloud foundation, learning Python.\n\nI have been researching second IT degrees and/or IT master degrees to get a foundation in IT and then move into the cyber career field at my organization.  I don\u2019t plan on leaving my employer, I still get a pension, so I\u2019m stuck with their rules. My employer requires some type of IT degree to even get an interview. I found a couple of programs that I was interested in and I approached my employer about paying for them. They agreed but with the exception that it must be cybersecurity related. Literally, they will pay by the course but the course title has to have security in it. So\u2026I need a cybersecurity degree but one that lays out a good IT foundation.  Any suggestions?",
            "Recently laid off from tech. I was a test engineering technician, working in automotive. Been doing cyber for 4 years just self learnings \n\nI\u2019m looking for internships in the Denver metro. Does anyone have any clues on where to look?",
            "Hi. I just recently graduated with a masters in criminal justice with a concentration in cybersecurity. My bachelors is also in criminal justice but with minors in computer science and geographic information systems. I\u2019m wondering what jobs I can/ should go for? \n\nI work in the cj field now and have been at my job for about 3+ years and I\u2019m constantly being told I\u2019m over educated and under paid. I made more money at my previous job(s) but figured my current role was a stronger resume builder. I\u2019m 24 y/o now and I understand that is young but I just cannot help but feel discouraged when looking for jobs. I appreciate your time and advice! Thank you \ud83e\udee0",
            "Hi everyone, I recently graduated with a biology degree, but it is something I no longer wanna pursue. I've been looking into cybersecurity and want to know what I should do to get my foot in the door as quickly as possible. I was thinking of getting comptia securtiy+ and network+ certs and maybe some lab work to try and land an entry level job. Anyone know a good general pathway for someone self-learning?",
            "Student here trying to decide which certification to got for. I know CEH has a reputation of being kind of a dud, and is generally considered to be not difficult enough to verify anyone's skills, but what about CEH Practical?"
