            "Essentially, the resulting metagame after a Lax ban would require too much clean-up. Zapdos is a candidate people point to that might need a ban afterwards, some say Jynx to follow, then Bliss etc.. This would be sweeping changes to a meta that people have been playing for 20+ years and no one really wants to deal with the headache, since tiering shifts in legacy metas are usually quite slow and historically mired in bureaucracy. This isn't helped by how unpopular gen 2 ou is in general, possibly dragging out this process even longer. \n\nSnorlax wasn't banned the first time because tiers weren't usage based back in the day. Since then, it has shaped the surrounding meta. Some would even argue that while Lax is undoubtedly op, it's not too restricting, because Lax being on every team gives them an automatic check to many threats while also grants them a wallbreaker against most opposing structures, which many considers a positive presence in the tier.",
            "Having mons witg really high usage is not necessarily restricting. As long as they both fit on multiple different teams and can be beaten by multiple different teams. And having very common mons is good for a stable metagame. If hypothically all mons in a Tier were equally viable them noone could reasonably predict any team they might face. The tier would be chaos and matchups would be highly luck dependant.",
            "Let me put it this way. Pre-Gen 7 in Doubles, Lando was everywhere. Was it far too common? Yes. Was it restricting? No. Gen 2 Lax is the same way. Without it, the Gen would collapse into Blissey-mania and Stall hell. Lax is the glue that keeps everything together in both OU and Ubers",
            "Snorlax + 5 is more diverse than Blissey + Golem + Electric + Skarm + Spiker + filler (if you run a stall team that is) \n\nFor offense, they'd need to run some very frail mons together like Champ, Vaporeon, Wak,... That'd just make them completely collapse to Jynx. Or you can run dumb non Spikes stuff like Belly Zard or Quag if you're that desperate. \n\nNot to mention the repercussions of booting Snorlax to Ubers, you'd need to ban at least 5 other mons to make the tier playable.",
            "because it just isn't banned\n\nYou could write paragraphs about how it's actually not that busted, how it keeps the meta together or how having mandatory mons is totes cool actually and not a sign that this mon might be busted to hell and back...\n\nbut really, the reason is back then ppl just banned the box legendaries and some obviously unfun stuff like evasion or the low accuracy OHKO moves and called it a day. Different ban philosophies and all of that",
            "OP yes, restrictive not-so-much. While Snorlax is undoubtedly the most important piece of any Gen2 OU team, it\u2019s not one you can just send out and win the game with on its own. Lax has many viable sets in OU and Ubers, and so has many different ways to counterplay, so how you build and use your Snorlax is a vector of skill expression in its own.\n\nTo use a popular analogy, Gen2 OU is like chess, and Snorlax is like the queen.",
            "i remember watching a video about this, and basically the Gen 2 meta would be way worse if Snorlax wasn't there, as it keeps in check other threaths like Zapdos",
            "Snorlax is overpowered, but in a way that\u2019s healthy to the meta",
            "I think about that too, how that would change the meta?",
            "Honestly, I don\u2019t mind a Pokemon like Snorlax in Gen 2.\n\nIt gives you a Pokemon to build around, simplifying teambuilding without being too difficult to deal with.\n\nSnorlax is good, but it\u2019s not the kind of Pokemon which wins after one turn of setup or that 2-hit KOs anything with choice specs."

        "content": "Early this generation, everybody called Mega-Banette the Noob-Trap of National Dex OU because it lured in inexperienced players with its Base 165 Attack and access to Poltergeist as well as its incredible utility movepool, but was in reality dogshit due to its poor speed, frail defenses, and lack of coverage. \n\nHowever, it's since risen to C- in viability in the [Natdex OU Viability Rankings](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/national-dex-viability-rankings.3714511/post-9990767) and is OU by usage. Discussion [(1)](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/national-dex-viability-rankings.3714511/post-9808747)[(2)](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/national-dex-viability-rankings.3714511/post-9951925) in the VR thread reiterates the same points that Mega-Banette users always make, namely its Base 165 Attack and access to Poltergeist as well as its incredible utility movepool. \n\nNone of this has changed, so why has it now become something on the same level as Mega-CharX, Mega-Gyarados, and Enamorus? Is it due to the lack of ghosts in the format? Apart from itself, the only other ghost type by usage in OU is Ceruledge. The only other ghosts types, Dragapult and Gholdengo, were banned in September and November, respectively, so why has it taken so long for Mega-Banette to rise to C-(February)?",

            "Team USA used it so good success during SPL which meant people had to admit it does have a niche in the tier.\n\nThe issue mega Bennette had in OU was it being OU by usage, not it having a niche at all, it has always had a niche on certain types of offense, but you'd see it on teams that would be better off with a Lop more often than not. I still don't think it deserves OU by usage but it definitely deserves a slot on the VRs like it has.",
            "To be honest, I still think it's complete ass and a nooptrap.\n\nJust use Ceruledge instead.",
            "I mean I don't know natdex but C- is infact dogshit",

Unless you want to specifically build your team around it (why) it's recommended not to use it still. Don't even think it got any relevant tour results since the ones that got it ranked, frankly.\u00a0",
            "\u201cSince\u201d is generous and it was largely out of respect for some good players who got some success with it during SPL but it\u2019s since just been a flop and as time has gone by, it\u2019s only revealed more why it\u2019s just bad.\n\nTo start, it has awful 4MSS which makes it have nasty flaws no matter what moves it runs. It should be able to act as a Mon that can disrupt opposing offense but actually thuds badly into offense because those pack booster energy users which blank Poltergeist, as well as numerous dark types that eat its hits well. Even Pok\u00e9mon like Ursaluna sees use on screens teams and some specific offense in addition to its place on BO teams and Banette gives that beast endless free turns.\u00a0\n\nHow about other playstyles? Well Stall sits on it forever with Blissey alone, and Dondozo often is able to handle it well while Corv can drain its meager 8PP. Balance has Garg which is an obvious as to why that\u2019s an issue, but also tend to have defensive cores Banette can never get past. Mega Lopunny is often seen on these teams too, and the many Dark types of the tier also give it grief.\n\nSpeaking of that, MBanette fails harder because it can\u2019t even cripple its Dark checks like Dragapult could or Darkrai can. Because Prankster is blocked by them meaning they get free entry on it. Mega Tyranitar gets free rocks or a chance to DD, or threaten a Pursuit. Ting-Lu does not give a care and gets free spikes or clicks ruination on random switch ins.\u00a0\n\nWorst of all is that it\u2019s a Mega which means it takes away that use when there are far better Megas for any role you\u2019d want it to fill. There are better ghost types and there are better disruptive Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, it\u2019s not worth using and if ladder has any sense of reason (lol) they\u2019ll finally let it die and return to RU where it might fit in (I say hopefully because it was UU before OU and was equally terrible there).",
            "Because smth ranked often times gets way more experimentation and smtgg like enamored often is outclassed while mega ban is still crap in the one thing it does well\n\nAlso usage means jack in nat dex",
            "It's a massive matchup fish. It has always been pretty good into offense, but it just blanks into bulkier playstyles.",
            "I mean it\u2019s still a massive noob trap: C- is nothing to write home about, and definitely not justified in calling it \u201cgood\u201d. Does it have a niche? Sure, but it\u2019s minuscule, way overrepresented on ladder, and a good amount of Natdex players disagree with it being ranked at all.",
            "C- is a giga stretch and it's probably going to drop now because Zamazenta being banned means this is peak Dark-type season so Mega Banette gets destroyed more often and more easily by more teams.",
            "It was never bad, but quite literally overused for no good reason, similar to Regieleki, mimikyu and conkeldurr in some previous metas."
