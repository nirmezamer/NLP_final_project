        "content": "I can't fucking take it anymore. This pokemon needs to be fucking gone. EVERY GOD FORSAKEN GAME HAS ZAMAZENTA. Out of your 6 pokemon, you need like 3 dudes just to beat one dog. It's too bulky to be killed by most special moves, even some that are super-effective, and its blistering speed allows it to get Iron Defenses so fast your head will spin. preventing any physical attacker from KOing it. This doesn't even address the fact that its uninvested attack stat allows it to bypass should-be counters with coverage. There's such a small selection of things that actually beat it one on one that it's so goddamn frustrating.\n\nHow is it that all the ban conversations I hear are about Darkrai, Kyurem, and Raging Bolt when all of these pokemon straight up lose to this dumb dog? \"Oh, Kyurem runs a mixed coverage set that has loaded dice, icicle spear, and scale shot, that's the real problem!\" Those pokemon at least have counter-play. I'd rather play against Unaware Dozo Clod Clef stall every matchup than play against one more drooling ladder player with that dumb Iron defense set where I have to guess if it has Heavy Slam to beat my Fairy type, Crunch to beat my ghost, or fucking Stone Edge to beat my Moltres. This all ignores the fact that no pokemon abuses Tera half as well as this obese bitch. Oh, how quaint, your Valiant outspeeds and has super effective moonblast? Tera Fire Iron Defense go brrrrrrrr. Don't even get me started on those Life Orb attacker sets that have been popping up.\n\nIt's enabled the most obnoxious, low IQ teambuilding. Now every damn team is Zama + Glowking + Twave spam. How is one team style running the meta healthy? How is it that Stall sucks? Why I am I running into niche pokemon picks that are chosen just to beat one pokemon, and how come it's never enough? Did everyone forget how boring Gen 8 was? Are we all content to go back to that, where the fat legendary comes in and wins you the game?\n\nEveryday we stray further from Arceus and the beloved Son he sacrificed 'pon the cross, and when the day of reckoning comes, we will all deserve the damnation he will bring upon us. Do you think the creator of everything is happy when he looks at OU and sees that they unbanned this stupid boxart so that everyone can click Iron Defense in unison? Thou shalt not worship false swipe idols.\n\nZamzenta needs a suspect yesterday. If I'm wrong and the people choose to keep his dumbass in, fine, whatever, but there at least needs to be a vote. This isn't healthy or fun. It's macabre, sick, twisted, and perverse. If there's any justice in this world, the Holy Smogon council will take swift action against this monster, and we'll be better off for it.",

        "content": "So I've been looking at the old gens OU meta and noticed that many pokemon that ended up unbanned initially for bringing positive stuff and not being broken in that moment eventually end up becoming controversial down the line. We have multiple concrete cases of this.\n\n1. Excadrill (BW OU) - unbanned to help against Jellicent and bring one more rapid spinner to the tier, banned sand rush, people still complain about it.\n\n2. Kyurem-B (BW OU) - unbanned because it proved to be balanced, nowadays people say we shouldn't have bothered with it and instead ban stuff.\n\n3. Hoopa-U (ORAS OU) - allowed because initially it didn't prove to break the tier, then its specs set was discovered and was booted (though some people want it back)\n\n4. Darkrai (SV OU) - unbanned initially because everyone wanted it to, at first proved to be completely welcome in the tier, then sleep got banned and many people were saying darkrai was the issue, now there's more and more evidence for an upcoming darkrai test\n\n5. Zamazenta (SV OU) - unbanned because it was initially balanced, provides great speed control, decent blanket check, nowadays more and more people are frustrated with its body press set and it was banned from natdex OU already\n\nThere's also Keldeo and Latios which survived a couple of suspect tests back when BW OU was the main gen, now many people keep complaining about them 10-12 years later.  There's also Kyurem in SV OU which barely survived a suspect test, yet many people keep complaining about it.",

            "The BW Excadrill paragraph is a gigantic oversimplification of an issue that has been such an integral part of how BW OU has worked since day 1. Drills influence is so deep-rooted in how the BW metagame operates and has operated in the past that saying that it was to help against jellicent is a very misleading way to show how Excadrill was and still is a very controversial mon.\n\nOther than that yea unbanning a mon just because it doesnt break the meta doesnt mean it doesnt make it more toxic, which is often the case.",
            "there's plenty of examples of unbans proving to be perfectly balanced too, which is why they still happen. people nowadays seem really against retests of ubers which i can understand to an extent but you can't really know if something is broken until you play with it again, and you can always go back and ban if it's still busted. also idk if kyu-b is a good example, it's more of a situation of bad suspect timing than actually being busted afaik",
            "I mean yeah you're right but these mons are so much fun",
            "I feel although some examples are really spot on, the banning/unbanning of a mon has to do more with what the tier is expected to play as, all things considered.\n\nAn easy example of that would be with Gen 2 Snorlax.\n\nThat pokemon is nowhere near balanced. it is without a doubth the best mon in OU and arguably UBERS of that gen, however, as gen 2 games are expected to play methodically and \"slow\" his pressence is also what single handledly holds the tier from being barraged by special attackers and turning into a offense fest (or needing quite the number of bans)\n\nAnother example is Gen 5 Stall. I feel that with a tier as offensively oriented as Gen 5 you cant really have all playstyles fit into the meta, not even in a rock-paper-scissors situation where HO, stall, and balance counter each other somewhat, as dragons are wildly unchecked (barring themselves) and spamming dragon type attacks + magneton was a somewhat usable strategy.\n\nThat being said, what i think gen 9 will be known in the near future as a \"pseudo gen 5\" in the way that its more offensively oriented, seeing its wild moveset restrictions on status moves and, in general, moves like scald, that would slow down games significantly, and the absurdly complementary nature of setup sweepers and Terastalization, along with the feeling of having a Once-per-battle get out of jail card (defensive tera) that has literally forced VGC high-level play to be open sheet format so it doesnt become a guessfest.\n\nThe threats in gen 9 would be way easier to check if a light version of an open sheet format allowed both parties to see the tera type the foes pokemon are running, so as to be able to take more stimated guesses and so it doesnt turn into the rich-get-richer mechanic that is proving to be, seeing as the best pokemon in gen 9 were able to run a multitude of different tera types.",
