        "content": "Natalie Holloway was 18.  In 2005 she went on a school trip to Aruba.  After a night of drinking and partying with her friends, things took a turn for the worse.  She was seen getting in the car with 3 men. After that she was never seen again. Joran Van der Sloot, the murderer is the son of a well respected judge on the island.  Now after 18 years he confesses.  He also murdered the daughter of a prominent political figure from Peru.",

            "I dont believe in capital punishment, but Joran van Der Sloot makes a great case for it.",
            "Words cannot express the hate I hold in my heart for this guy.",
            "I don't believe he just \"pushed her out to sea.\"  She was dumped out at sea and he had help. I always felt they shoved her in a weighted crab trap, took her out by boat,  and sank her",
            "Wild, when this happened I thought this was just another woman who went missing because I was a little girl. Now Im an adult myself and seeing she was only 18 when she went missing makes me so sad, she was just a girl.",
            "In addition to him murdering women, he also was arrested for drug smuggling in Thailand and embezzlement  of the Holloway attorney.",
            "I dont believe in capital punishment, but Ill make an exception for this case\n\n-Redditors on every single case",
            "He was involved in criminal activity from way back in his lifetime.",
            "They think his father was involved some how with the coverup of the murder as his son Joran went to his father for help.",
            "I agree. I think she would have been found if that was the case. He wouldn't have taken her far out if he only waded out till he was knee deep as he claims. I just don't think it's plausible. Whoever helped him dispose of her body is almost as much of a monster as him - how could they watch the torture Natalee's family has gone through?",
            "Desperation is a hell of a feeling. Because the only reason he got himself in trouble in the US is because he was broke and needed money, and figured a great way to get money was to extort the family of the woman you supposedly didnt murder. \n\nI rarely think criminals are as dumb and people like to say, but damn, thats just so stupid."

            "Some of yall are so convinced he did this on purposeIm not saying he didnt, but isnt the only evidence extramarital affairs? It feels like a weak motive without any other pieces of evidence\n\nDownvote away, I stand by my opinion that this is flimsy evidence, and the state clearly agreed ",
            "As much as a scumbag as this guy is, the evidence against him was so flimsy I'm glad it got overturned. Next time it might result in a good person being prosecuted.",

            "There is not an ounce of me that's thinks this is an innocent mistake. I've watched everything I can about this and TRIED TO see it. He purposefully baked his son. He even goes to check to make sure he is dead at one point. NOT seeing or smelling your dead son in a hot car (the kids bowels would have emptied) is absolute BS for one.",
            "Did you see his fake ass hell crying in the interrogation room. The guy was acting like his water was his savior to stop crying and \"hyperventilating.\" So fake and pathetic.",
            "That's what I think too. I really don't think he had any contempt for his son like that. He was a cheater, a creep who was into teenagers, and negligent, but I don't think he left his baby to die in a hot car on purpose.",
            "yeah idk. He's a skeezy guy but even the ex wife was like, our marriage sucked and he was a shitty husband but he loved his kid. "

There's also talk he was out on bail for alleged sexual assault against a previous partner meaning he was suspended from his job. He also had a history of mental health struggles. In other words, what people are surmising here about murder-suicide could be possibly correct and he may not be  the 'decent  person'  he's been painted as by some media and those who have given tributes on their socials.  It's a sad situation.",

I think this will be a shock for them as well. Hopefully the tone of the reporting will change now.",
