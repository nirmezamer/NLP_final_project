        "content": "I live in Albuquerque and work in a hospital.\n\nLast year, a detective came in to question one of our patients who had been shot. Because I am a true crime nerd and had done a lot of reading about this case, I couldn't resist asking the detective about the West Mesa case (In 2009, the bodies of 11 sex workers were found in the West Mesa in Albuquerque, NM).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Mesa_murders\n\nI showed him I didn't have a phone on me and that I was just wearing scrubs and assured him I was just curios. I made sure he knew that if he talked to me about it... There would be absolutely no way for me to prove the conversation happened.\n\nI asked flat out \" Do you think Lorenzo Montoya killed those young ladies?\". The detective smiled and said \"I can't give any names, but I can say that I believe the person who committed those murders is no longer alive and I personally consider the case closed\".\n\nNow you can believe me or not. I don't have any proof. But you can check my profile to see I do live in ABQ and I do work in a hospital. I swear on my daughter that this interaction happened.\n\nLorenzo Montoya is 100% the person who committed those murders. He was caught red handed murdering a sex worker. He had had a sex worker in his trailer. The sex worker's boyfriend/pimp had grown concerned because the date was taking so long. When he pulled up to the home, he found Lorenzo loading up the body of the sex worker in his car and proceeded to shoot and kill Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo was killed in 2006. The pimp was never charged with a crime for killing him. The bodies of 11 sex workers were found in the West Mesa in 2009. All of the women had been killed prior to Lorenzo's death (between 2001 and 2005). And the site where the bodies were found was less than a mile from Lorenzo's home.\n\nOn top of all this, the following video was found at Lorenzo's home:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dZSEY06eyo\n\n\nAccording to police, in the full video Lorenzo is having sex with a woman. Then the video abruptly cuts to the footage linked above like the sex video had been taped over.\n\nIn the video, you can hear someone doing something with trash bags and duct tape. The sex worker Lorenzo was caught red handed murdering had been wrapped in trash bags and duct tape. Some of the bodies that were found in the West Mesa also showed signs of being wrapped in duct tape and trash bags.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Lorenzo committed those murders. And that was the case even before I had this conversation with the detective. Albuquerque Police still consider the case \"open\". Every few years they will have a press conference and ask the public for information. But it is pretty clear no one is working the case and they also unofficially consider it closed.\n\nAnother thread prompted me to make this post... So I just thought I would share. I know this has major \"My dad works at Nintendo\" vibes. But if I had any proof... There's no way the detective would have talked to me. So it is what it is!",

He was checking on a patient who had been shot, hoping he was able to answer questions about the shooting. \n\nIt was just the detective and I in the hallway.

I think an Albuquerque detective is a lot more likely to know a bit about the most famous unsolved murder case in their city than an FBI agent is to be familiar with the DB Cooper case. \n\nThat being said... If you had the opportunity to pick the brain of an FBI agent about something you were interested in that they may have knowledge of... Wouldn't you take it!?",

I live in a much smaller town, and actually know a lot of cops(mostly in the have mutual friends sense), and my dad is a criminal court judge. I totally get it. \n\nJust saying, I really do not think he would have spouted off to anyone other than very vaguely. I just meant that plenty of FBI agents are willing to talk about DB Cooper (an often discussed and very popular unsolved true crime case) and give generic and vague opinions. Very few will go into specifics.",

            "We're on the same page for sure. \n\nJust to be clear... The detective made it clear he **personally** considers the case closed. You're right that it was just his opinion. \n\nThere's no way he would say anything like that to the media or in an official capacity. The department still officially considers the case open."

Out of consideration for the survivors, we will not be releasing any further information.\u2019\n\nBlyth\u2019s body was handed over to his relatives to be returned to Scotland after an autopsy.\n\nA UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u2018We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Turkey and are in contact with the local authorities.\u2019",
