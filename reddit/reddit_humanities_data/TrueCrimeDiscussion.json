        "content": "Natalie Holloway was 18.  In 2005 she went on a school trip to Aruba.  After a night of drinking and partying with her friends, things took a turn for the worse.  She was seen getting in the car with 3 men. After that she was never seen again. Joran Van der Sloot, the murderer is the son of a well respected judge on the island.  Now after 18 years he confesses.  He also murdered the daughter of a prominent political figure from Peru.",

            "I don\u2019t believe in capital punishment, but Joran van Der Sloot makes a great case for it.",
            "Words cannot express the hate I hold in my heart for this guy.",
            "I don't believe he just \"pushed her out to sea.\"  She was dumped out at sea and he had help. I always felt they shoved her in a weighted crab trap, took her out by boat,  and sank her",
            "Wild, when this happened I thought this was just another woman who went missing because I was a little girl. Now I\u2019m an adult myself and seeing she was only 18 when she went missing makes me so sad, she was just a girl.",
            "In addition to him murdering women, he also was arrested for drug smuggling in Thailand and embezzlement  of the Holloway attorney.",
            "\u2018I don\u2019t believe in capital punishment, but I\u2019ll make an exception for this case\u2019\n\n-Redditors on every single case",
            "He was involved in criminal activity from way back in his lifetime.",
            "They think his father was involved some how with the coverup of the murder as his son Joran went to his father for help.",
            "I agree. I think she would have been found if that was the case. He wouldn't have taken her far out if he only waded out till he was knee deep as he claims. I just don't think it's plausible. Whoever helped him dispose of her body is almost as much of a monster as him - how could they watch the torture Natalee's family has gone through?",
            "Desperation is a hell of a feeling. Because the only reason he got himself in trouble in the US is because he was broke and needed money, and figured a great way to get money was to extort the family of the woman you supposedly didn\u2019t murder. \n\nI rarely think criminals are as dumb and people like to say, but damn, that\u2019s just so stupid."

            "yeah idk. He's a skeezy guy but even the ex wife was like, our marriage sucked and he was a shitty husband but he loved his kid. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"
