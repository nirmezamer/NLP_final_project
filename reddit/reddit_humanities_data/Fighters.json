        "content": "Street fighter 6 is looking stacked as always, Mena, and Angrybirds are obvious favorites, but I'm really looking forward to seeing a few of our US defenders try and show out, ready for Dual Kevin to make a crazy run and show what marvel players are made of. \n\nMarvel is gonna be great, RayRay is a super fun player to watch with his absolutely filthy Magneto. Escalante is someone I mostly know for his mvci play, but I've see great things from him in mvc3 and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it. \n\nCvs2 is always big at CEO, because Jebaily is a massive cvs2 fan, like is most likely gonna get top 8 this weekend. But BAS is flying out from Japan for this, and for anyone who's never seen BAS, he is the most dominant player of the fgc of all time, having won like over 80% of all majors he's entered across 20 years of actively playing the game. Always amazing to see him work.",

            "Anyone know what the UMvC3 exhibition match is?",
            "Tekken looks wide open, since Arslan and the top Koreans aren't there. I could see a ton of different players winning it, but I'm gonna say Atif finds his form and wins it.\n\nFor SF6 I actually think Punk will win. He has looked unstoppable in recent online tournaments against some of the best NA players. Of course, Mena is still the favorite.",
            "I know people don't really care about platform fighters here, but Brawlhalla is likely releasing their next character as well. Otherwise yeah your predictions seem pretty solid",
            "Like always + NA level isn't that great outside of 1 or 2 guys like Nuckledu so it doesn't say much, and online tournaments are different from offline ones, especially for Punk who often chokes there",
            "We\u2019re probably not expecting much in terms of announcements here, right? It makes sense that any big announcements will be saved for EVO in 3 weeks.\n\nSome possible guesses:\n\n-\tA release date for Lidia in Tekken\n-\tA tease for the next GBVSR character to be playable at EVO since they already announced the new balance patch will playable there. Maybe the next Battle Pass costume\n-\tAt most, a new avatar collab for Street Fighter\n-\tProbably nothing for Strive since they tend to announce the first season pass character at EVO. A look at Team of 3 gameplay would be cool though\n-\tNew character trailers for unreleased games like Fatal Fury and Hunter x Hunter\n\nI feel like even these guesses are being slightly optimistic. Anything bigger would be a surprise",
            ">He has looked unstoppable in recent online tournaments against some of the best NA players.\n\nHonestly I feel like that's been the reocurring thing with Punk lately. Dude perform like a World Beater up until like the Top 4.\n\nI'd like for him to finally take a major for SF6 though.",

            "As someone who\u2019s first experience with notations in fighting games was Injustice and Mortal kombat, numpad notation is something I just can\u2019t get used to. Mortal kombat just wouldn\u2019t work with numpad notation, as it uses a weird system for its basic buttons, with front and back punch and front and back kick, working similarly to Tekken\u2019s buttons, so it makes sense for them to use the same notation system. Injustice could totally work with numpad notation, as it uses light, medium and heavy for its buttons, but as MK players would\u2019ve be the ones to make up the notations for IJ, they probably just wanted to stick to what they knew.",
            "quarter-circle half-circle and the like are best used when spoken, numpad notation is best used when written. It doesn't have to be a contest. It's really not hard to read both.",
            "The way I know I have brainrot is that numpad notation is more understandable to me. Its like those people who read analog clocks faster than digital ones",
            "I'd rather use numpad notions than these abreviations. And it's not even because I am an anime fighter fan, it's just better for any fighting game. I think it's a question about adapting yourself instead of complaining. It's not that hard \n\nI know it's a joke and all but I wanted to say it anyway",
            "I don\u2019t know what either of these things mean and at this point I\u2019m too scared to ask",
            "Numpad when typing, full name when speaking",
            "Just say 624624. Also what game has a that motion? And even if all those stars alligned, i have to ask the classic question, what about the language barrier? I live in a spanish speaking country and saying 6246P is much better than saying \"half circle back forward\" and risk my friends not understanding. Which happens all the time. And if you say \"just say it in spanish\", then now the notation in writing makes no fucking sense.\n\nBad take. Put it back."
