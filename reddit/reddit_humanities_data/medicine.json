            "Hello everyone! Reposting my comment from the last biweekly thread since nobody commented and I'm still in need of some advice. \n\nIn a few months, I'm set to graduate from my undergrad (major in health studies, minor in globalization). I used to be a biology major but then realized that while I wanted to study health, I was more interested in exploring non-biomedical dimensions of health issues \u2014 for example, exploring maternal health from anthropological, ecological, and sociological perspectives.\n\nBack then, I also used to believe medicine was my calling. However, with my interests shifting (and also after coming face-to-face with reality), I sort of put medical school on the back-burner. It's not completely out of the question, and may very well be something I consider seriously in my 30s when I'm hopefully more financially stable and have more real-world experience under my belt. But for now, I've decided it's probably not my thing.\n\nAnyway, I recently met with this postdoc who is currently working on issues of health delivery in conflict settings, among other things she's doing like research, serving on advisory boards, and directing a non-profit. I just love everything she's done in her career and I feel she's what I aspire to be. Turns out she's a physician as well, except she doesn't practice. And it got me reconsidering medical school. How important is a medical degree for a career in global or public health? And for those who go through medical school, how did they decide to step away from medical practice and choose an alternative route, like academia or research? I would appreciate if anyone could give some advice!",
            "Q: How feasible is it to be a medical scientist without an MD-PhD and just an MD?\n\nQ: Lack of relevant research experience for MD-PhD but struggling to break into research in the field, any advice?\n\nHi!\n\nCouple questions here!\n\nI was planning on working in clinical psych (masters LMFT and eventually PhD once I have honed on my research interests), but my experiences with medical assisting, providing emergency first aid while working at the gym, working as a dance and fitness instructor, and reading a ton of literature on psychoneuroimmunology and psychosomatic medicine has resulted in all my skills, expertise, and passions clicking. I want to pursue an MD-PhD, but I realized this in my last year of undergraduate studies and lack relevant research experience.\n\nI have been applying to labs but have not had much luck. I fear I won't have enough research experience to be a competitive MD-PhD applicant by the time I apply in two years, but I would still like to actualize my dream and purpose by contributing to this field of research. In the case I still am unable to gain enough research experience for an MD-PhD, does anyone have any advice on doing research and being an instructor/professor with just an MD?\n\nAny other non-traditional MD-PhDs who may have insight on getting research experience without being tied to a university? I fear I am too late, but I deeply care about this mission and will do whatever I need to do and more to earn the opportunity to make my dream a reality. For more context, I am currently still attached to a social sciences lab from my undergrad studies and have had independent research experiences in history (history of medicine, topic was abortion policy and the history of the AMA) and ecological sciences (studied differences in plant growth for a particular plant being restored at the reserve). But I have no experience in the physiological or psychological sciences, which I was I am trying to break into. I read textbooks and take online courses on these topics on my free time and took a year of Biology/Life Sciences and Biomedical Ethics out of interest and curiosity.\n\nI am planning on co-authoring a paper for my social sciences lab, and my independent research paper will likely be published in an undergraduate journal, but I doubt these pubs will be relevant for an MD-PhD.\n\nThank you so much! Any help or guidance would be appreciated! I don't have anyone in my community or family who understands or is knowledgable about this field, so any insight is gold to me. Thank you!",
            "I was once in medical school, then forced to take a withdrawal in my first year in order to handle family problems, which  affected me + fatigue problems from concurrently working in the military.\n\nSpent my time in COVID recovering due to being vulnerable.\nThen I got sick with something that completely disabled me physically. To use a computer, I need a very specific chair to support my height and shoulder blades, while minimizing neck strain. Without that chair, I\u2019m a saggy bag of barely functional muscles and struggle to walk/stand.\n\nI also need breaks to deal with the loss of several sheaths across my neck\u2019s blood vessels. Neck and head movements will actually squeeze and pull on them. Not fun to have superficial veins pull the inside of your ear and cause bleeds.\n\nDespite all of this, my mind remains sharp and perceptive. Hung around radiologists and rad techs for a while. Didn\u2019t have the same anatomy course they did, but I was persistent on cases they thought were case closed normal - found bone fragments and odd anomalies like a vascular loop that would have otherwise been missed. I also found a strange case of muscle infiltration that an MSK radiologist missed due to its subtle nature and got props from several doctors for it.\n\nI thought about being a doctor again. But realistically, do I stand a chance due to my disabilities and my time of being a former matriculant? Or should I go go another field?\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that\u2026I was tasked to document something systematically terrible against patient rights in my locality. I\u2019m now being asked to make it public, but I\u2019m afraid of being blacklisted from both med school and practices."

Whilst waiting for them in pre-op I tried chatting to the nurse, but I quickly noticed she looked traumatized and was trying her hardest to hold back tears. And by traumatized, I mean staring around the room at absolutely nothing seemingly trying to distract herself from what she dealt with \n\nA scrub nurse came in looking serious but quickly changed to friendly as he noticed the single patient waiting for surgery (always nice to see nice bedside manners).\n\nAnother nurse came in to check on the upset nurse who said she had to turn off what I'm guessing was an intercom because she couldn't listen to something anymore (screaming? resuscitation efforts?)\n\nAs more and more people came into this small room, the patient was essentially rushed early to the actual theatre so that they could have a debrief. By the time the patient left, there must have been at least 20 staff (including a senior sister and critical care consultant) who said they need to have a debrief.\n\nKnowing I didn't need to be party, I asked if I should come back and they said yes (my colleague took over the initial reason I was there).\n\nI'm just curious as to what on earth could have happened in an opthalmology theatre that was so traumatic. As someone who's had eye surgery in the past, I'm aware of the risks but nothing that I'd expect would cause such distress to staff.\n\nP.S - Please don't take this as me calling staff weak - I was really impressed at how quickly staff were checking on each other and consoling one another, and I think that's the best attitude to have in a team.\n",

If possible, pull someone aside after the fact, because every incident is ultimately an opportunity to learn and prevent future adverse events.\n  \nHowever, of the greatest fears I have for, even a simple cataract, would be a patient with an unsecured head and a surgeon operating while not controlling the patients head - in other words using a wrist rest instead of resting their hands on the patient\u2019s head. A patient who is under any range of sedation and/or is claustrophobic can come-to and jolt awake in a panic - also a very common concern for patients with dementia. Even sneezes and coughs are seem like balancing on a tightrope during an earthquake: just freeze and wait for things to settle.\n \nAs an aside I really wish manufacturers (Alcon, Storz, etc) would change the power delivery noise to just straight-up Enya, not the sound effects from Tron. Whatever we can do to help patients relax is good with me.",

Hospitals realize that patients don\u2019t have a choice in who they use in the ED and are understaffing them and using unsupervised non-physicians in their place. They also have been decreasing nocturnist differentials and just using their regular staff to work those shifts instead.

I've heard they make great leaders at that program so if the initiative to unionize is representative of that, seems to be true."

I would much prefer a national formulary but absent that PBM's having to tread the line between HHS or patients suing them and giving pharma buckets of money for me too drugs seems like a (much less) good alternative.\n\nWouldn't a national formulary that uses a consistent method of efficacy & price evaluation resolve this issue? Would physicians prefer this system, and its restrictions, over the diverse formularies we have right now?",
