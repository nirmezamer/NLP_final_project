            "Q: How feasible is it to be a medical scientist without an MD-PhD and just an MD?\n\nQ: Lack of relevant research experience for MD-PhD but struggling to break into research in the field, any advice?\n\nHi!\n\nCouple questions here!\n\nI was planning on working in clinical psych (masters LMFT and eventually PhD once I have honed on my research interests), but my experiences with medical assisting, providing emergency first aid while working at the gym, working as a dance and fitness instructor, and reading a ton of literature on psychoneuroimmunology and psychosomatic medicine has resulted in all my skills, expertise, and passions clicking. I want to pursue an MD-PhD, but I realized this in my last year of undergraduate studies and lack relevant research experience.\n\nI have been applying to labs but have not had much luck. I fear I won't have enough research experience to be a competitive MD-PhD applicant by the time I apply in two years, but I would still like to actualize my dream and purpose by contributing to this field of research. In the case I still am unable to gain enough research experience for an MD-PhD, does anyone have any advice on doing research and being an instructor/professor with just an MD?\n\nAny other non-traditional MD-PhDs who may have insight on getting research experience without being tied to a university? I fear I am too late, but I deeply care about this mission and will do whatever I need to do and more to earn the opportunity to make my dream a reality. For more context, I am currently still attached to a social sciences lab from my undergrad studies and have had independent research experiences in history (history of medicine, topic was abortion policy and the history of the AMA) and ecological sciences (studied differences in plant growth for a particular plant being restored at the reserve). But I have no experience in the physiological or psychological sciences, which I was I am trying to break into. I read textbooks and take online courses on these topics on my free time and took a year of Biology/Life Sciences and Biomedical Ethics out of interest and curiosity.\n\nI am planning on co-authoring a paper for my social sciences lab, and my independent research paper will likely be published in an undergraduate journal, but I doubt these pubs will be relevant for an MD-PhD.\n\nThank you so much! Any help or guidance would be appreciated! I don't have anyone in my community or family who understands or is knowledgable about this field, so any insight is gold to me. Thank you!",
            "Hello everyone! Reposting my comment from the last biweekly thread since nobody commented and I'm still in need of some advice. \n\nIn a few months, I'm set to graduate from my undergrad (major in health studies, minor in globalization). I used to be a biology major but then realized that while I wanted to study health, I was more interested in exploring non-biomedical dimensions of health issues  for example, exploring maternal health from anthropological, ecological, and sociological perspectives.\n\nBack then, I also used to believe medicine was my calling. However, with my interests shifting (and also after coming face-to-face with reality), I sort of put medical school on the back-burner. It's not completely out of the question, and may very well be something I consider seriously in my 30s when I'm hopefully more financially stable and have more real-world experience under my belt. But for now, I've decided it's probably not my thing.\n\nAnyway, I recently met with this postdoc who is currently working on issues of health delivery in conflict settings, among other things she's doing like research, serving on advisory boards, and directing a non-profit. I just love everything she's done in her career and I feel she's what I aspire to be. Turns out she's a physician as well, except she doesn't practice. And it got me reconsidering medical school. How important is a medical degree for a career in global or public health? And for those who go through medical school, how did they decide to step away from medical practice and choose an alternative route, like academia or research? I would appreciate if anyone could give some advice!",
            "I was once in medical school, then forced to take a withdrawal in my first year in order to handle family problems, which  affected me + fatigue problems from concurrently working in the military.\n\nSpent my time in COVID recovering due to being vulnerable.\nThen I got sick with something that completely disabled me physically. To use a computer, I need a very specific chair to support my height and shoulder blades, while minimizing neck strain. Without that chair, Im a saggy bag of barely functional muscles and struggle to walk/stand.\n\nI also need breaks to deal with the loss of several sheaths across my necks blood vessels. Neck and head movements will actually squeeze and pull on them. Not fun to have superficial veins pull the inside of your ear and cause bleeds.\n\nDespite all of this, my mind remains sharp and perceptive. Hung around radiologists and rad techs for a while. Didnt have the same anatomy course they did, but I was persistent on cases they thought were case closed normal - found bone fragments and odd anomalies like a vascular loop that would have otherwise been missed. I also found a strange case of muscle infiltration that an MSK radiologist missed due to its subtle nature and got props from several doctors for it.\n\nI thought about being a doctor again. But realistically, do I stand a chance due to my disabilities and my time of being a former matriculant? Or should I go go another field?\n\nThen theres the fact thatI was tasked to document something systematically terrible against patient rights in my locality. Im now being asked to make it public, but Im afraid of being blacklisted from both med school and practices."

Whilst waiting for them in pre-op I tried chatting to the nurse, but I quickly noticed she looked traumatized and was trying her hardest to hold back tears. And by traumatized, I mean staring around the room at absolutely nothing seemingly trying to distract herself from what she dealt with \n\nA scrub nurse came in looking serious but quickly changed to friendly as he noticed the single patient waiting for surgery (always nice to see nice bedside manners).\n\nAnother nurse came in to check on the upset nurse who said she had to turn off what I'm guessing was an intercom because she couldn't listen to something anymore (screaming? resuscitation efforts?)\n\nAs more and more people came into this small room, the patient was essentially rushed early to the actual theatre so that they could have a debrief. By the time the patient left, there must have been at least 20 staff (including a senior sister and critical care consultant) who said they need to have a debrief.\n\nKnowing I didn't need to be party, I asked if I should come back and they said yes (my colleague took over the initial reason I was there).\n\nI'm just curious as to what on earth could have happened in an opthalmology theatre that was so traumatic. As someone who's had eye surgery in the past, I'm aware of the risks but nothing that I'd expect would cause such distress to staff.\n\nP.S - Please don't take this as me calling staff weak - I was really impressed at how quickly staff were checking on each other and consoling one another, and I think that's the best attitude to have in a team.\n",

            "People are bringing up patient-related incidents but it could just as well be something else. During my medical school opthalmology rotation, the outgoing, friendly resident appeared greatly upset all day and was on the verge of tears. Everyone was gently treating him all day. I didn't know what was up until the end of the day. It turned out his grandfather had been killed in a car accident early that morning. \n\nThen there was the time the popular head of the ER at another place I trained was admitted with a massive heart attack. The doctors and nurses he usually led had to take care of him."

Obviously I'm not alone and just grateful I'm not truly on essential meds like insulin. It's not always been, /this/ bad. But these insurance companies are willing to keep it up because even having 1 more day of not having to extend cvg for an Rx is a win in their book. It's criminal and only getting worse. Smh. What can we actually do about it? \n\nMy eye specialist for my dry eyes had told me she's been seeing an exorbitant increase in Rx denials/ PA requests from an array of insurance companies even within the last year.

Hospitals realize that patients dont have a choice in who they use in the ED and are understaffing them and using unsupervised non-physicians in their place. They also have been decreasing nocturnist differentials and just using their regular staff to work those shifts instead. Not speaking specifically to Christiana, but this has been the trend in the field.\n\nChristiana is considered a top EM residency program this is a pretty big deal.",

If so, is this your personal practice, or mandated by the hospital? \n\nOur hospital is trying to implement this standard in IR. Even though we do use Avagard before cases, they want us to go to a separate sink area and do a scrub first thing. I don\u2019t have a major issue with this other than it\u2019s another top down mandate from some clipboard king, and that my skin is already fucked from how often I use alcohol sanitizer. We have had no procedure related infections that they are trying to reduce, but rather they just want to \u201cstandardize\u201d practices. To me, this feels like a variant of the scrub cap /bouffant issue. \n\nIf consensus is to do the sink scrub every day, I\u2019ll hop on board, but I don\u2019t see any data for this in our area of the hospital. Many of our procedures are class 2/3 (neph tubes, g tubes, abscess drains, etc). We are of course very careful with any class 1 type cases like ports, spine implants, and the like. ",
