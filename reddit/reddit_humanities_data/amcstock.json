Just keep in mind when it rains (red days) not to panic and start bashing everyone because of your financical decisions. The mods and I are always here lurking. We just keep silent and do the janitor work that's needed behind everyone's back! \n\nNow to something more positive. We have some good movies coming out in the next couple months, make sure you go see a movie and support AMC! Feel free to ask questions or tell me what movies you're looking forward to for the rest of the year in the comments. Ill be answering questions and replying back off and on for the rest of the day.",

I'm looking for payback, and when and for how much this thirst will be quenched, I don't know. I'm seeing red and I'm looking for blood.",
