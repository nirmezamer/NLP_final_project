            "I just turned 17 years old, 6'9, 225 lbs center playing in Europe. I train 3 times a day, 4 times a week. The other two days are game days, unless we don't play then it's rest. Typical day I do weight training, individual training for my position, and team practice. I am incorporating stretching at home to reduce injury, but I want to increase my vertical, especially my standing dunk. I can windmill off one foot, but I only do open dunks, and almost never do standing dunks in game. I still have not dunked on anyone and I want to be unstoppable. I read that I shouldnt do plyometrics if I am already playing basketball multiple times a week. I was thinking about starting to do jump roping, tibialas, noridcs, split squats at home with no weight. Should I also do 1 plyometric exercise at home as well or like a vertical jump exercise? If so, which one? I want to be able to drive and dunk with no effort and drop step dunk over someone. In games I hesitate. I also read that maximum effort jumps will help as well and was thinking about doing those everytime after practice for 30 minutes? Also, how important is my diet involved in this?",

I take a backpack and fill it with books then do squats, jump over things, do lunges, squat jumps, all kinds of things. Just find plyometrics and use them daily. Make sure you plan out what you want to do.",

I'm 5'9 and 160 lbs and I'm trying to increase my vertical so I'm able to dunk.\nI'm doing heavy squats atg and 4 different plyometrics exercises every leg day 2x a week along with rdls. How have you guys increased your vertical jump? I will also be biking soon probably 3x a week.",

Im 15.5 which is on the shorter end for my age however I just got my first growth spurt recently and last year about this time I was about 5,1 or 5,2. Currently Im doing plyometrics some leg training and some core exercises. I have been doing these for about 3 weeks and have seen some improvements. I can touch the backboard and with a running vertical I can touch 9 feet. If I keep going can I dunk by my senior year (I'm in 10th currently). Im doing plyometrics Monday Wednesday and Friday currently.",
            "Hi all, could u guys give me some advice on how to be able to dunk properly (like accurately and consistently), I'm currently able to touch the rim with the 2nd-3rd segment of my fingers (counting from hand) if I stretch myself and jump as much as I can (I'm 5'10 without shoes and 132lbs), and I think I will be able to grow a bit as I'm still 15 and half. What type of training should I do to be able to dunk, preferably in 4-5 months?",

            "So on the hoop there are those little hooks that carry the net. When I dunked today I realised that it's possible for my finger to get in there. So I'm now wondering whether it's possible to injure yourself by having your finger stuck in those holders?",

            "6'1 and couldn't touch net 6 months ago, after fixing my form and using the penultimate step I was able to touch rim in a month. After cutting weight and eating healthier and doing plyometrics 4X5, isometrics, bench presses, 50 weighted calf raises, Iso-lateral leg curls 4X5, and leg presses 3 times per week and just jumping a lot got me 7 inches over the rim 6 months later. Good luck y'all.",
            "Hello Everyone, I am a 6'0 freshman in high school and want to make the basketball team next year. I feel like if I was able to dunk my chances to make the team would be astronomically higher ( No one on the team can dunk), I was looking at programs and came upon vertshock and thought that with it I could for sure dunk. I can dunk on 9 feet pretty okay .. I think I need like another 12-13 inches. It would be awesome to get it during the summer but a must before tryouts in Novemeber. I have never done plyometrics before .. would Vert Shock be a good program? Some said it is really good while others said it is extremely bad. Could someone with experience or who did the program give me some thoughts on their experience with it?"

However, after a 10 day vacation where i played no ball, I played a game of 21 where I shot lights out. \n\nI really felt like I couldn't miss getting to 17 (2s&1s) primarily from beyond the arc. Maybe missing 4 of my shot attempts.\n\nUnfortunately the group I was playing with kept letting in new players till we had about 9 bodies in the paint. I'm maybe six foot with my hoop shoes on and a bit overweight. So it became difficult for me to get a board.\n\nThen after about 8min of not really playing, the game ended and we did runs. At that point I wasn't hitting shit and the ball was passed to me less and less.\n\nIn the game of 21 was I heated up/ had a hot hand? Or was it just luck?\n\nIf not, did the 8 min \"break\" cool me off to where I missed out on some crazy runs?\n",

When Im warmed up and my heart rate is way up and my adrenaline is pumping I cant really feel those injuries as much so Im no longer compensating with my movements.
