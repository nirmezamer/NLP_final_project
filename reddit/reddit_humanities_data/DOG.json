            "Serious question, how can you tell that's a nightmare and not a happy barking dream?",

            "That's just plain old simple dreaming to a dog. All of the dogs I've ever had did it. Don't disturb them - let them keep dreaming and don't get upset about it because it's 100% natural and normal",
            "This is REM sleep. Do not wake them from REM sleep.",

She would follow me around all the time and anytime my big dog came to me she would protect me and bark at him. Whenever I would climb my backyard walls as a kid she would go crazy until I would get down. Every time I cried she came and supported me, licking off my tears. I slept and cuddled with her every night, and she was like my best friend. I came home from school today to find out she passed peacefully. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel so lonely and lost without her. I don\u2019t know what to do. I just want her back. ",

Mourn how you need, know you couldn't have prevented this in any way, and that she went, knowing that you loved her with every fibre of every being, ever. She felt loved, had food, water, lots of enrichment, love, and toys.\n\nYou're an amazing owner, who loves & loved their pup.\n\nIt will get easier to cope with eventually, but with time \n\nKnow that she will never forget you, and that she's running around in the doggy afterlife, with an unlimited supply of yummy food, yummy treats, balls, bones, and squirrels/other desirable objects to her, to chase.\n\nYou did the best you could. My inbox is open if you need a chat  I'm in Australia, so giant time difference, but I'll respond when I can."
