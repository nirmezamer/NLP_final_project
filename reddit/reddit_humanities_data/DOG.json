She would follow me around all the time and anytime my big dog came to me she would protect me and bark at him. Whenever I would climb my backyard walls as a kid she would go crazy until I would get down. Every time I cried she came and supported me, licking off my tears. I slept and cuddled with her every night, and she was like my best friend. I came home from school today to find out she passed peacefully. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel so lonely and lost without her. I don\u2019t know what to do. I just want her back. ",
