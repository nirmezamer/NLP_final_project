I saw two items fall from the one that was wobbling.  The wobbling object crashed further away.  I drove my truck to where the pieces fell from the wobbling object.  The pieces were sky blue in color.  \n\nOn the ground near where the pieces fell was a large shape that was sky blue in color.  I took many photos from different angles and many videos. I also recorded GPS coordinates of where the shape was located.\n\nWhen I touched the shape, a panel opened.  I saw a screen with an image of earth, the moon and the sun, and odd symbols.  Next to the screen were illuminated buttons.  I lifted one end of the shape to put it in my truck.  As I lifted one end of the shape, it rose into the air about 4 feet off the ground and stayed there.  I did not have straps to secure the shape in the bed of my truck.  I did not want the shape to leave my truck bed if I hit a bump in the road. I dug a hole and buried the shape.  I would like to sell the shape to the highest bidder or, in the alternative, give it to a party to study with a contract that gives me 85% of any profits derived from study of the shape.  The party must satisfy me that it has the technological ability to properly examine the shape and develop technology from study of the shape.  No US companies allowed.",

She needs help with whatever is causing her to turn to the substances. It will only get worse from here unless the true problem is dealt with. If she is messing around with pills; that is not to mess with. You have no clue what\u2019s in those pills nowadays. And if she is getting them from family and friends medicine cabinet, which I did, she needs help like yesterday. \n\nAre YOU close with your sister? Are you able to sit her down and tell her how much you love her and that you are there for her? Tearing someone down when they are depressed only fuels the fire. If you are not the answer maybe a teacher she admires? Or a friend, anyone who she is close with. \n\nI hate to say this, but ultimately this is your sisters choice to stop or not stop. From personal experience, someone \u201ctelling\u201d me to just stop only made me do it more.  Because to me, they didn\u2019t understand the hurt I was feeling. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I gave you any answers and I\u2019m sorry about that. My heart goes out to you and your family. Your sister will be in my prayers. Healing her mind and heart is where the focus needs to be. Best of luck. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79"
