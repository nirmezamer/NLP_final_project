        "content": "# Are you:\n\n* wondering how to get your tier set?\n* reading the bonuses and wondering if they're worth taking?\n* unsure of which pieces you should aim to wear?\n* concerned that a different tier set is overpowered and want to complain?\n\nWell you're in the right place. Down below there is a comment for each class showing what your tier set is for each spec.\n\nIf you click on (stats) in the list below you will be taken to a Wowhead page that will show you the stats of each piece.\n\n**If you don't know how good your tier is, ask below. If you know how good your tier is, tell people below. Any contributions welcome.**\n\n# How to get tier pieces:\n\n1. You get one free tier piece token per character for hitting 1600 rating in any bracket for the achievement [Dragonflight Season 3 Master](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19396/dragonflight-season-3-master) (you will receive an [Emerald Mark of Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210944/emerald-mark-of-mastery) which you can use to buy a tier piece from [Theozhaklos the Curious](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=213285/theozhaklos-the-curious))\n2. By being lucky and receiving the piece in the Great Vault\n3. By using the [Revival Catalyst](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/revival-catalyst-dragonflight) which is available from the start of the season. You will receive a [Renascent Dream](https://www.wowhead.com/currency=2796/renascent-dream) when the season starts which can be used to turn a piece of conquest gear into tier. You will receive another [Renascent Dream](https://www.wowhead.com/currency=2796/renascent-dream) every two weeks after the first week to convert more pieces.\n4. You can also raid for tier gear, but it's lower than conquest item level and **raiding is boring**.\n\n# How is the Revival Catalyst different in Season 3?\n\n* The Revival Catalyst will open for Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope at the beginning of Season 3.\n* When the Catalyst opens, all players will receive a  Renascent Dream Charge for every one of their characters.\n* Every 2 weeks thereafter, all characters on your account will automatically get a Renascent Dream charge.\n\n**I'll say it again for those at the back - if you get 1600 in week one, you can get two pieces of your tier set in week one without relying on any RNG.**\n\n# Comment links:\n\n**Click the name of your spec to see the discussion about that tier set in PvP. Click (stats) to see the stats on each piece of your classes tier.**\n\n**Death Knight** [(stats)](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item-set=1557/risen-nightmares-gravemantle): \n*

We had relative success with reaching 1600 on the first 2 weeks of s4 and couldn't climb higher no matter what. Then I consulted you lot and you advised me to go demon hunter because apparently Holy and Arms were not an ideal comp. \n\nWe had smooth sailing to 1800 on my DH and reached our goal and have to thank you for the advise.\n\nMy question is, what makes the 2nd comp better than the first? What factors play when determining the power of a comp?",

And if you have 2 classes with roots+slows - hunter/druid it just completely negates an arms warr and holy priest doesn\u2019t have a ranged kick so against shams/druids you\u2019re going to be getting cloned+hexed a lot on your dmg outside of reflect. \n\nDH has a mortal strike and can constantly connect its damage with near infinite mobility. Same with UH DK\u2019s - dks are the reverse with always being able to connect through grip/wraith walk/chains/death advance etc. has a MS- ranged kicks. this is a major factor in why UH dks and DH\u2019s are S tier  melees for 2\u2019s - next to impossible to kite a good DH or UH DK.",
            "Thank you.",
            "First of all, Demon Hunter is currently better in almost everything. This alone should make a noticeable difference. It's great for beginners because it's very easy to play and delivers good results.\n\nRegarding good or bad comps: An important factor of a good comp is the available CC. This especially involves diminishing returns; meaning: CCs of the same DR category reduce the effectiveness of subsequent CCs. As a result, the optimal comp has as much CC from different categories as possible.\n\nWith Warrior and Priest, the main CCs are Fears, and as you might guess, they are in the same category. This means you don't have an effective CC combo. DH Priest works much better because the DH offers many more options for CC. This allows you to chain DH stun + cage + fear and benefit from the full duration of each CC.\n\nThis is also one reason why mage/sub rogue has always been a strong comp. They have so much CC from different categories that their win condition is simply to completely prevent the opposing team from playing.\n\nYour win condition should look something like this: besides the normal damage that the DH already puts out, you have a kill target while the other target (usually the healer) is CC\u2019d, and during this time, you try to kill the DD with as much damage as possible. In the end, 90% of comps are about chaining CCs effectively and using that time to take out an opponent. That's why CC classes play such an important role.\n\nYou can check which CCs are in the same category here: [Diminishing Returns](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Diminishing_returns).\n\nKeeping this in mind, you can look for further synergies: For example, rogues like to play with disc priests for the extra damage from the priest and because their CC categories don\u2019t overlap. Affliction Warlocks like to play with resto druids because the HoTs and the self-heal from the Warlock make them incredibly tanky, even in situations where the healer can\u2019t heal.\n\nFistweaver, arms or DK are strong, especially against casters because you can't get away from them. They have many CCs and kicks while they passively heal themselves.\n\nThere are many possible comps, and you can theoretically succeed with anything if you have mastered arena basics and enjoy playing your class. However, for serious attempts to climb, you should be aware of the possibilities of comps and their win conditions."
