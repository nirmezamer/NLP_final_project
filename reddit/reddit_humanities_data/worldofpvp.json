        "content": "# Are you:\n\n* wondering how to get your tier set?\n* reading the bonuses and wondering if they're worth taking?\n* unsure of which pieces you should aim to wear?\n* concerned that a different tier set is overpowered and want to complain?\n\nWell you're in the right place. Down below there is a comment for each class showing what your tier set is for each spec.\n\nIf you click on (stats) in the list below you will be taken to a Wowhead page that will show you the stats of each piece.\n\n**If you don't know how good your tier is, ask below. If you know how good your tier is, tell people below. Any contributions welcome.**\n\n# How to get tier pieces:\n\n1. You get one free tier piece token per character for hitting 1600 rating in any bracket for the achievement [Dragonflight Season 3 Master](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19396/dragonflight-season-3-master) (you will receive an [Emerald Mark of Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210944/emerald-mark-of-mastery) which you can use to buy a tier piece from [Theozhaklos the Curious](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=213285/theozhaklos-the-curious))\n2. By being lucky and receiving the piece in the Great Vault\n3. By using the [Revival Catalyst](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/revival-catalyst-dragonflight) which is available from the start of the season. You will receive a [Renascent Dream](https://www.wowhead.com/currency=2796/renascent-dream) when the season starts which can be used to turn a piece of conquest gear into tier. You will receive another [Renascent Dream](https://www.wowhead.com/currency=2796/renascent-dream) every two weeks after the first week to convert more pieces.\n4. You can also raid for tier gear, but it's lower than conquest item level and **raiding is boring**.\n\n# How is the Revival Catalyst different in Season 3?\n\n* The Revival Catalyst will open for Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope at the beginning of Season 3.\n* When the Catalyst opens, all players will receive a  Renascent Dream Charge for every one of their characters.\n* Every 2 weeks thereafter, all characters on your account will automatically get a Renascent Dream charge.\n\n**I'll say it again for those at the back - if you get 1600 in week one, you can get two pieces of your tier set in week one without relying on any RNG.**\n\n# Comment links:\n\n**Click the name of your spec to see the discussion about that tier set in PvP. Click (stats) to see the stats on each piece of your classes tier.**\n\n**Death Knight** [(stats)](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item-set=1557/risen-nightmares-gravemantle): \n*

Your spellbook should be able to fill up 2 actions bars with extra bars only for macros etc. ",

            "As someone who balked at really getting to know the DF talents trees and mostly just used the presets, I think they're making great progress towards streamlining the new TWW talent trees and alleviating a lot of the pain points and eliminating weird design choices. I've been able to get on every class on the beta and not feel overwhelmed by the trees, they feel a lot more natural to follow and easy to figure out coherent builds within.\n\nWith that being said I think they badly need to add player choice to opt out of AoE passives and procs which have proliferated like crazy, but that's maybe an aside.",
            "Wow actually is very easy to learn and hard to master. The problem with wow PVP is there are only masters playing it. So you step into the arena as a simpleton and you are matched against someone far better than you. Then you never enter the arena again. \n\nThere is a reason why BGs are so popular... Because there is less agency on the individual. There is way more room for making mistakes and it's a much friendlier noob environment.",
            "I love these posts. My problem is; there's nothing out there that comes remotely close to replacing WoW PvP for me. There is something about it that is just so magical to watch, especially someone like Pikaboo. It's like watching someone who's figured everything out and can make it look so simple.\n\nNot sure what the solution is; but I've tried for years to find a replacement but I always eventually come back to WoW. It's like a martial art, or something that you constantly have to train to be good at. Probably better comparisons, but I really believe that if you wanna be super high level in WoW, you have to put in that grind, and once you get stuck at certain ratings, reflect on; what can I do to make myself better?\n\nThat was what changed things for me in arena. Targeting macros for enemies and team were so crucial in a game where everyone's literally doing that at high level, and even medium levels now. The barrier to entry is crazy now because even at 1600 you're fighting players who aren't like how the old 1600 was. \n\nI do hope that WoW gets some competition. It's always good to have a competitor, that way Blizzard has a reason to really put in more effort. But, I loved Dragonflight and I am super pumped to see where the game goes.\n\nEnd rant!",
            "I'm at a hard place where I love the ability bloat bc it fully fleshes out each class. Which is why DF has the best class fantasy. But I understand that this also makes it hard for new players. I think where the most important and easiest route to make the game easier and on a level playing field is get rid of all addons and WA's. This would actually create a environment for new players to join and be on an equal playing field immediately. All they have to do is learn their class and keybinds.",
            "> and go back to the old talent trees that were actually digestible instead of the crazy mess that talent trees currently are for new players\n\nI'm so glad there are other people out there who feel the new talent trees a huge downgrade from the MoP -> Shadowlands systems.\n\nThe talent trees offer the illusion of choice. I felt like I moved stuff around way more in the old system compared to the new one, where trying to make one change often means fucking your whole tree and having to solve a dumb puzzle so that you can purge something.\n\nCasuals like talent screens that look like trees though I guess. Must be why every AAA under the sun has one.",
            "This sounds like old wow not new wow. Classic tbc / wotlk / cata / maybe mop had really large gaps between skill floor and ceiling but the floor was so low that everyone played and felt useful.\n\nLike when I would do bgs in my Grey gear at level 14 in the 19 bracket on my nelf druid clicking my spells, and when I healed the warrior on my team who couldn't heal himself I felt useful. Same way my moofire ticking for lethal made me feel good. Because dps couldn't heal and that worked both ways for my noob approach to the game.\n\n\nOr when my warrior finally connected with something and hit them, that health bar wasn't going back up unless I got stopped. Felt idk. Consistent. Logical even.",
            "IMO I think a lot comes down to how \"maintenance mode\" a lot of rotations have gotten due to PvE and having to manage optimizing that on top of CC and all the other things you have to track.\n\nUHDK between now and Cata/MoP is like night and day. Now you have to manage wounds on 1-2 targets, make sure u keep defile stacks, have vp up, have plaugebringer up, monitor festermight stacks falling off to not waste popping 4 wounds with apoc, maximize doomburst, not cap on RP. \n\nIn Cata/Mop/wod it was, put dots up, use DC on procs and when capped on rp, hold runes for necrotic stacking.\n\n\nOnly game close to as enjoyable as WoW PvP is BDO 3v3 PvP. Completely different style than WoW though more akin to a fighting game. It's the only MMO PvP that's kept me entertained other than WoW currently.",
            "Does this mean that wow has never been one of the \"best games\" since it has never been easy to learn. ?"

Let me explain.\n\nOn my first post here I asked for a beginner-friendly class to start learning pvp as a returning player.\n\nWell, I made a big assumption. Which is that I would enjoy DPS classes only.\n\nTurns out, I love healing. I am literally having a blast healing people. The giveway was that I wouldn't be frustrated if we lost a game. That was my a-ha moment.\n\nBut I digress, sorry.\n\nSo, I tried 3 healers: holy priest, resto druid and MW monk. I loved them all for different reasons, but it's time I decide onto which I should invest my time. Which one should I pick?\n\nI don't want to know which one is the easiest to play, but maybe know from more experienced players which one has more \"potential\".\n\nLook, the best feeling I had in the game was saving multiple people from certain death, while also saving my own ass. Seeing that bar (and others) not depleting after minutes of intense pressure was like crack.\n\nAlso the sensation I love the most is the feeling of being unkillable. I mean good players can cc you to death, I get it. But sometimes, and your cds aligns, and they can't just bring you down? I fucking love it.\n\nWhich is the best class that gives you that \"saving the game\" feeling?\n\nI mean, I'm sure any healing class has that at various degrees. But if you were to pick, which one would it be?",

            "As a resto druid\u2026 you are often the kill target. You CAN get pretty tanky but ultimately you\u2019ll have to rely on your team to peel for you.",
            "Resto Druid. It\u2019s the Devs favorite and hasn\u2019t been weak since literal vanilla when you could only have one rejuv up on someone. Holy is almost always outshined by disc and MW monk is just too low IQ of a spec to put time into. No skill ceiling",
            "I picked up pres evoker for the first time this week and it feels awesome, all the utility makes it feel like you really save the game.\n\nIt also seems quite op - I'm a terrible healer but just hit 1950 as preservation with 70 wins 40 loss",
            "having played most healers in pvp setting, assuming u are just playing casual say around 1600, for bg, i would say druid cos of the mobility and flag carrying capability. if u doing 3s, i would go for mw monk, its difficult to focus monk due to its tanky def and mobility (ring of peace, transendance, roll, sprint). Can be very offensive if u into fistweaving, sub 15% = instant death button on top of aoe stun, disable, 15s interrupt cd. its basically playing healer on easy mode, at least for me",
            "I haven't noticed around 2200-2400 in SS that resto druids would be the kill target, should they be?",
            "sounds like i gonna boost a monk. i love low iq classes lol",
            "That is a funny way to start when Cata is on the classic servers, and r-druid was the worst healer in arena for that entire x-pac.",
            "Indeed. Resto druid and disc priest have historically been the two go-to PVP healers, either would be a good choice imo. Personally I'm a disc main and really love it. Resto perhaps has a somewhat higher skill with than disc, but there are a lot of nuances for disc too that make it a spec where you can keep getting better and keep optimizing your play.",
            "Good choice Resto is also 0 brain cyclone spam. I just don\u2019t personally enjoy shape shifting so if that\u2019s your thing go for it",
            "With MW make your own research. Imo the MW is not the low IQ class and is pretty difficult to learn and master.  I am playing a lot of all healers except shaman and comparing resto druid with MW is a sin imo. Meaning MW is much harder to play"
