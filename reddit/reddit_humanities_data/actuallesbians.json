It\u2019s a red rash and there\u2019s no mistaking what put it there judging from the EXACT placement.\n\nWe have a full day planned with my parents and little cousin coming into town to visit today. I cannot have this. SOS, please help, it\u2019s an emergencyyyy!!!!\nHow do I get rid of this or atleast calm it enough that it won\u2019t be so OBVIOUS?!? ",
