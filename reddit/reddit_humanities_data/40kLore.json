            "Catachans. You die brutally to a regiment of the toughest, strongest and most natural warriors of the Imperium. Regiments of Rambos pretty much. Tons and tons of Rambos and Dutch's (Arnold Schwarzenegger from Predator).\n\nYou won't win..",

A very rare sight indeed, but it means someone with power wants to get this sh*t done fast and clean. *They are practically Space Marines without augmentations, peak-human conditions armed with the most insane arsenal Mechanicus can spawn. Grey Knights alternative for Astra Militarum.*\n\nCatachan are natural born warriors that goes through a real Monster Hunter game all their lives. If they have the environmental advantage rather than open-warfare, it will be a real nightmare and they-will-win. *One story involves a famous leading officer losing his arm to a freaking LAND SHARK and then ripping the sharks throat out by biting it. Another boring day in Catachan forests.*\n\nEven Imperium thinks Kriegsters are batsh\\*t insane, if they werent so useful Big E himself would vote to nuke them off. Those relentless bastards destroyed Space Marines, Tyranids, even pushed Necrons back and destroyed tombworld cores. You know something is really wrong when Commissar actually tries to be reasonable or Inquisition itself tries to avoid few problems related to Krieg. *A Krieg team once coordinated almost instantly to force an invulnerable/phasing Canoptek Wraith into melee-combat (so that it would engage its phase-out protocols to become vulnerable) and then the rest of the team shot the everliving sh\\*\\*t out of their charging-comrades and the machine to death, didnt even blink.*\n\nAs a fear bonus but not regiment, seeing the lonesome Eversor Assassin wandering amongst the ruins and friendly/enemy corpses means you are fu\\*\\*ed beyond measurement. It means various fun activities like being branded a heretic-fugitive by Inquisition for nothing-at-all and being involved in an active scorched earth protocol. *That is what they send to make the place disappear from history while Exterminatus batteries are charging.*",
            "I mean *all* Guard regiments are scary when you're some barely literate underhive scum caught up in a rebellion. Shits hit the fan when you see full time, professional soldiers arriving in their hundreds of thousands with tanks, artillery, heavy weapons, Naval and specialist support to put down your demands for fairer working hours and food.",

The Taniths are expert marksmen and good at moving covertly\n\nThe XXIV Catachan is the same, ambush and traps. Just a bunch of Rambos killing and dissapearing into the jungle \n\nYour forces would be picked apart one by one by an unseen force, If you run, surely you will trigger an explosive trap, If you don't, snipers will kill you",

            "I'd imagine they keep the rank and honours but not the duties normally associated with it but as with all things space marine it really depends on the chapters culture and traditions",
            "They don't lose their rank as such, but they become \"venerable\". Leadership is hard when 99% of their existence is spent in hibernation. And yes, in some chapters, dreadnoughts are used as walking and talking reminders of the past.\n\nA notable exception is Bjorn of the Space Wolves (gtfo with that \"Vlka Fenryka\" nonsense, they wolf down with the wolf lords every chance they get. so space woofs is perfectly fine), who at various times acted as chapter master after he got entombed in a chassis.",
            "Dreadnought is not part of thr active command chain often. However when deployed one is a hightly honoured advisor. \n\nAnd you'd do well.to listen to the old dreadnoughts suggestions",
            "Referencing \u201cThe Glorious Tomb\u201d audio drama, much time and many deaths pass while a dreadnought is asleep, to the point where the Space Marine inside begins to lose his identity, except for a few veterans who remain in the chapter, and is identified by the dreadnought chassis itself.",
            "Since most dreads spend their time asleep between battles I doubt captains get to remain captains but I could see a dread retaining a sergeant rank",
            "Depends on the Dread, the chapter, and the circumstances\n\nDreadnoughts who held rank can still command when they\u2019re aroused to war, there are plenty of examples.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll permanently keep a command they held, as they\u2019ll be asleep most the time, but a senior captain/officer dreadnought would absolutely be able to resume their role should it be required. It\u2019s happened on several occasions, such as with the Ultramarines 2nd company on Damnos or with the M32 Battle of the Fang on Fenris.\n\nI believe the Iron Hands also had one of their clan-companies permanently led by a Dreadnought at one point, who simply didn\u2019t go to sleep like normal dreads and retained his captaincy",
            "I think it depends on the Space Marine. For example, Magneric from the Black Templars led a squad even after he became a Dreadnought. Or, for example, Ares from the Iron Hands. But some simply became warriors and did nothing but battle.",
            "Depends on the chapter and the marine, really. \n\nMost officers (captains/lieutenants/sergeants) probably become venerable dreadnoughts, but aren't awoken to lead their soldiers to battle - the position is probably already occupied by someone with a more contemporary experience by now, and most they can do is to aid their company.\n\nChaplains, however, often retain their lucidity and remain [spiritual leaders of the chapter in death](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Chaplain_Dreadnought#) both among loyalist and chaos space marines (e.g. Sor Talgron/Warmonger of WB).\n\nThere's also at least a single incident of a [Chapter Master](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Carab_Culln) retaining his rank (de jure) even after being interred - though I'd guess he doesn't lead Red Scorpions often.\n\nBlood Angels & their successors also inter their librarians, so they could also provide advice to the new adepts of Librarius.\n\nAlso, Iron Hands & their successors revere their dreadnought brethren the most, even giving them seats on Iron Councils due to their expertise.",
            "There is a heresy era word bearer chaplain in dreadnought in Word Bearer's Omnibus. He is an advisor most of the time and the spearhead/commander of the dreadnoughts in battle. Current chaplain sees him as a hero and sage. His approval of the current chaplain is what made him the current chaplain. So yes, rank matters. Other dreadnoughts are not cared as such.",
            "They are honored but think rank stops really mattering. They just become a respected elder who offers counsel and experience. Won't be leading detachments but will probably be part of the leaders immediate subordinates depending on how mentally  sound they are."

Caught between the crossfire of paranoid Guardsmen trying to stem both the tide of Tyranids as well as panicking people that want to leave, brutally gunning down their own as well as the Nids. The little family, with their newborn finally make it off planet with the help of some underground \"rebels\" that has managed to get them a spot on one of the transport ships. All is well you think, till you realise the little family are all last generation genestealers cultists and their little infant is a newborn first generation genestealer, and they have effectively just infested a ship and are now heading to a new world.

Demons were coming through and command decided they couldn't save the planet or the soldiers they had fighting for it, the sent in Navy fliers to drop nukes, but didn't tell them their targets were \\*everyone\\* including their own people. \n\nOn the way back this character realises what they have done, and works out that all the returning pilots are being neutralised, so runs for it with their remaining fuel, managing to just get away, for the moment.\n\nIn the stories current moment, this woman wakes up screaming knowing she is responsible for nuking a bunch of loyal soldiers and also that the Imperium will literally never stop chasing her to keep her quiet.\n\nLiteral horror story for everyone involved.  We can't know if there was any other way to deal with the planet once the Guard started losing, but with massive cult activity on the surface plus a full reality incursion, pulling an 'Armageddon' might actually have been the only way they had available to deal with it.",
            "One of the most unnerving stories I read was \u2026 the night of the wolf (I think) . Some space wolves sent to pacify a rebelling imperial world get caught up in a dark eldar invasion of the same planet . The rebels and space wolves successfully fight off the xenos , and become close friends over the course of the fighting . The space wolves , during the victory feast , simply assume that the rebels would naturally want to be absorbed back into the imperium after all they\u2019ve went through , but the opposite is the case. \n\nWhen both sides realise this, the wolves just gun down their former rebel comrades at the feasting hall, and later order their ships to blow up the main rebel cities",

In the Krieg novel Dead Men Walking, some of the local citizens of a planet being invaded by Necrons decide to rebel and start worshipping the Necrons. They manage to take the commissar of the Krieg regiment hostage. So there's this rebel leader holding a gun to a commissars head in the middle of the street telling the Kriegers to fuck off. So the Krieg soldiers back off right? Wrong. Without hesitation, they just blast the shit out of both the rebel and the commissar before marching on.",
