            "Not really we were only told it was dangerous but not shown it, the process has been improved since then so its not even theoretically very dangerous now. It would've been hilarious if someone like Dante was killed off on the operating table, people would've been sooo mad haha. Would've been an awful decision, but really funny haha",
            "I think a lot of people need to come to the realization that primaris was just an in lore reason to explain why models got bigger. No important character will ever actually die from it and at some point (hell even now) will be a nothing term. And its more of a tool to explain why a charcater might return or become prominent again in the lore",
            "I think theyve changed the lore so that the procedure is much less dangerous now, specifically so that they wouldnt have to worry about this logical inconsistency. Not a retcon necessarily, just that Cawl has improved the procedure so much over the years that most Marines who undergo it survive now. And coincidentally just in time for most of the Firstborn named characters to get shiny new Primaris models",
            "They mostly don't want to kill off named miniatures",
            "Of course not.\n\nHell, Ragnar Blackmane used it as intensive medical care after his *BULLSHIT* fight with Ghaz.",
            "No, but with all medical procedures as time goes on they get better and better at it so the chance of dying decreases. That is likely what is happening with the Rubicon",
            "No model that sells is dying on the operating table.",
            "I mean... Calgar was dead for like 20 minutes when he went through it.\n\nBut he got better.",
            "Didn't Calgar die on the operating table three times?",

The first was the baseline and the rest are just different flavors. They were given numerical designation, thats group 1, this one is group two, they are group three etc etc.",
            "Probably no particular reason, just the number each Primarch had on their test tube. In ancient Roman times, Legion number correlated to the region that the Legion pulled recruits from and generally operated in, so even in ancient Roman times Legion number didn't correlate to the importance of a Legion, it was just for logistics.",

Instead, he treated them as tools and this exact treatment is why so many turned. Even the loyal ones were afraid of him disposing them just like the Thunder Warriors",
