        "content": "Hey there!\n\nIn short, as of today, this subreddit will be removing and redirecting posts that seek advice on replacing the operating system on your Chromebook. \n\nIn the past these posts were allowed with a disclaimer that better support would likely be found elsewhere, such as r/chultrabook and their associated communities. However that subreddit is now archived and they now only provide support on [their forum](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/).\n\nSince then there has been a rise in posts like this here, and we're simply not equipped to provide meaningful support. We've received lots of feedback over the past few months and the general consensus was that everyone is better served if these posts are now permanently directed elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear, we are not discouraging anyone from attempting this process; it's still cool, (potentially) fun and can unlock more utility from your device! The only change is that posts seeking support for this will be removed.\n\nThanks for understanding!\n\n---\n\n####**Helpful Links**\n\n* [Chrultrabook Forum](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/) -- the only place where support will be given for help with chrultrabook projects.\n* [Chrultrabook Docs](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/)\n* r/chrultrabook -- archived, but still contains some helpful information.\n* [mrchromebox.tech](https://mrchromebox.tech) -- for all your firmware-related needs.",

I\u2019ve always have MacBooks and I really just need surfing and video streaming(Netflix, hbo, etc) so I figured it was time to save money and try it. \n\nI do like it, but I\u2019m wondering if there are *chromebooks that offer better(louder) sound and screen resolution?* I have 90 days to return and if there are options for ~$400 or less that exist, I\u2019d love to get that instead. I\u2019m looking through specs and I don\u2019t see any sound specs but I\u2019m not particularly familiar with that spec in general.\n\nI purchased the [Acer Chromebook Plus 14\u201d Touchscreen Laptop \u2013Intel Core i3-N305.](https://www.costco.com/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-14%E2%80%9D-Touchscreen-Laptop-%E2%80%93Intel-Core-i3-N305---Protective-Sleeve-Included.product.1815945.html?sh=true&nf=true)\n\nAny guidance on what to look at or recommendations would be welcome!
