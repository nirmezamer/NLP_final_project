        "content": "Hey there!\n\nIn short, as of today, this subreddit will be removing and redirecting posts that seek advice on replacing the operating system on your Chromebook. \n\nIn the past these posts were allowed with a disclaimer that better support would likely be found elsewhere, such as r/chultrabook and their associated communities. However that subreddit is now archived and they now only provide support on [their forum](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/).\n\nSince then there has been a rise in posts like this here, and we're simply not equipped to provide meaningful support. We've received lots of feedback over the past few months and the general consensus was that everyone is better served if these posts are now permanently directed elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear, we are not discouraging anyone from attempting this process; it's still cool, (potentially) fun and can unlock more utility from your device! The only change is that posts seeking support for this will be removed.\n\nThanks for understanding!\n\n---\n\n####**Helpful Links**\n\n* [Chrultrabook Forum](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/) -- the only place where support will be given for help with chrultrabook projects.\n* [Chrultrabook Docs](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/)\n* r/chrultrabook -- archived, but still contains some helpful information.\n* [mrchromebox.tech](https://mrchromebox.tech) -- for all your firmware-related needs.",

I could disable the swap in order to never write anything on the disk and zRam is there to do what it usually does.\n\nI've seen a lot of posts saying that the command to enable it is \"swap enable some\\_number\\_here\", but as I could see from chrome://sys-internals, this actually enables the normal swap.\n\nExample: \"swap enable 2000\" in crosh enabled almost 2GB of swap on my disk. What I want to do is to really use zRam that, as I can see, is barely used while my slow disk keeps on being used.\n\nSince I barely have 4GB of RAM and my CPU is a slow Mediatek, my system lags or freezes a lot. I know I can powerwash, but I did this a lot already and it's not an option. I also am not sure if the system is TRIMming from time to time as I couldn't find any clear documentation.",

I know that both of those are bad for battery longevity, but I just need to know if those are the main problems, or if those are not the underlying source. below is a battery test I ran on crosh because I saw somewhere on Google to do it.
