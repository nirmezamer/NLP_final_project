            "I don't have an issue with the patch week, especially after last week's content and given what's coming next month.\n\nWhat I object to is MTX being promoted as the headline update, and even moreso I object to TH stuff being integrated into skills. The new ritual nonsense should have come from Um content, not from TH. Furthermore, it sounds like a new ritual that might be stuck on the Ritual selection menu using a TH item - that is completely unacceptable to me if so.",
            "\n>Grab the candles and ink - it's time for some Raising Rituals! In this new promotion you will complete rituals for a variety of necromancy themed goodies!\n\n>Imp soul in a box - The imp's soul trapped in this box will aid with one alteration ritual glyph during your next ritual in exchange for their freedom.\n\n>Token of the lost - The souls trapped in these tokens will protect glyphs and light sources from decaying for one ritual each.\n\n>Unfinished Business (sealed) - These sealed last requests left behind by a necromancer will task you with completing rituals in exchange for extra experience upon completing the request! You get bonus progress for completing the specific type or ritual requested.\n\n>Lost Keepsakes - Items with a connection to something which was lost, these can be used in a new ritual at 25/95 Necromancy to earn experience and ectoplasm like a regular rituals but also some retrieved lost items which can include things like necromancy supplies or a chance at the elusive Soul Dye!\n\nThese should be items obtainable/craft able in game. Not MTX bullshit.",
            "The God Armours look nice, i just wish they weren't obtained through MTX, and were used to graphically update the current models you earn in-game. The current Rune/metal armours haven't received a graphical update in over a decade\n\n>*On 6 March 2012, rune armour, along with many other armours, received a graphical rework -* RS wiki\n\n[https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/player-armour-gnomes-and-clan-fealty](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/player-armour-gnomes-and-clan-fealty)\n\n  \nIt's demotivating seeing so much content revolve around MTX",
            "\"Aura overrides should now appear whenever the Ranger Roll, Hall of Fame, Wraith, Enforcer and Running Scared walk animation overrides are active.\"  Love this!  Now if weapons could work with walk animations that'd be grand.\n\nEdit: aura overrides now are broken on all walk overides",
            "I am surprised they actually added another god aligned armour, thought they would never do that again.\n\nAs I always tell myself, I rather have cosmetics be purchasable with runecoins than that spinning thing.",
            "Just want to follow up from last week. Could we get confirmation that the T&S mattock (7 focus) is only supposed to be 3-7% better at obtaining materials, augments aside, than a bronze mattock (0 focus)? Is it intended for that stat to have such little impact?",
            "\"Players can now use Bladed dive with Balarak's sash brush and Skeka's hypnowand.\"\n\n\nThanks. That was really bothering me.",
            "Am I the only person angry that these existing armour \"cosmetics\" are MTX and not just an update to the actual armour in game?\n\nWhy is the in game armour that you actually have to earn (for ironmen) look worse than the MTX version you pay for with real money? I guess I answered my own question there, I just wish it wasn't this way.\n\nI remember when armours/weapons used to get graphical updates and didn't require real money to get.\n\nI'm not against cosmetics for real money btw. Jagex are a business and need to profit. I just think existing armours and weapons that are used in actual gameplay should be excluded.\n\nAll that said they look great and I wish they were an update to the actual sets with the option for retro override.",
            "Even though it's a patch week with mtx, I really like how we now know the mods who are working on rs3, feels more personal now.",
            "These new armours should just be graphical updates. People can pay for a new trim or something instead. Or a slightly more buff version with spikes or something. It makes no sense having the old models on clues that look inferior. And Aurora dye and Soul dye should be on clue rewards already. It's been over a year.\n\nHave a grace period of 6-12 months where the content becomes part of the game and people who buy it get it as an early bird bonus. Or they get a little buff to make it look more impressive when the armour gets added to the main game for everyone. Because these look great but shouldn't be locked to just MTX. Just communicate an ETA when it's in the main game for everyone and people who support the game by buying it early get the exclusive tier 2 version unlocked. Something that looks a bit better but everyone can still get the base version. A bit like elite sirenic vs regular sirenic.\n\nThe retro stuff can be permanently MTX. But the graphical upgrades need to be added for everyone in the game eventually."

        "content": "As someone who does a lot of melee, I do actually appreciate what the March combat update did for Leng swords.\n\nMy only real gripe, and I can't be the only one, is rather simple: when you gain a primordial ice stack and proc Frostblades, you get a 9s duration for it. If you gain another primordial ice stack with Frostblades active, it resets the duration to 9s instead of adding the time to your existing Frostblades time.\n\nThis is particularly annoying with getting quick/consecutive primordial ice stacks, especially on multi-hitting attacks like a dragon claw EoF. Essentially, you lose potential time on Frostblades by getting lucky.\n\nI realize that there's balancing at play here because it could be an issue if you could endlessly stack Frostblades time. I would suggest at least allowing a maximum of 15-18 seconds for Frostblades (18s, optimally, allowing 2 consecutive primordial ice stacks to give 9s of Frostblades each).\n\nIt's not uncommon to get primordial ice stacks in quick succession, and if Frostblades could allow you to have more than 9s at a time it would feel like less wasted potential when it does happen.",

            "This is a great idea, would make Frostblades feel so much more consistent.",
            "Also if we could keep the primordial ice stacks at phase transitions like p7 zammy would be great.",
            "I would in all honesty think that's a pretty bad idea and instead want something else, my primary gripe with leng swords is the chance of getting the stacks is too low. Personally I've tried to do some raksha pool skips and it's just not fun. I did the entire p1 and four times in a row ended up with 0 leng stacks when it came to the point where I'd typically use leng spec. Next kill I got 5 stacks off that bat. It's super inconsistent.\n\nAs for your suggestion, yeah, it sounds cool, but you're getting 24% dmg if we take my situation for 45 seconds, they'd have to heavily reduce the amount of extra dmg frostblades provide which is why I'd just like to see the chance increased for more consistency",
            "I basically only melee.\n\nDefinitely would need testing, because as it stands Melee is very powerful and competes with Necromancy at many bosses for speed kills.\n\nWould definitely feel nice, though the reset on the buff to seconds isn't bad as is.",
            "no, getting infinite boost is not the point of this equipment\n\ninstead just activate some effect if it procced while there was still time, like 5% ability damage for each tick remaining, so procing it back-to-back will hit for 60% and reset timer back to 9sec",
            ">As for your suggestion, yeah, it sounds cool, but you're getting 24% dmg if we take my situation for 45 seconds\n\nThis is why I suggested capping it at 15-18s. It allows for a quick/successive primordial ice stack to not go to waste while making sure extreme luck with multiple procs doesn't make it unbalanced.\n\nI don't think this is adding in an extreme level of unbalancing, at least not enough to require reducing the overall effect.\n\nIf it were changed to be more consistently proc'd with a higher overall chance, I think that would throw off the balance more than my suggestion. Assuming you'd be under the Frostblades effect far more frequently if that was the case.",
            "Never would I thought I\u2019d hear \u201cmelee is very powerful\u201d when it\u2019s been sitting crying in the corner since eoc started pretty much",
            "You make competing with necromancy sound like a bad thing. Necromancy is one rotation with absolutely zero switches, best sustain, and best aoe damage. Melee on the other hand is a very click and switch intensive style great for only 20(24) seconds of zerk with the worst sustain and aoe. Melee hands down should be out dpsing necromancy. Otherwise what would be the point of different combat styles."

Death also mentions he couldn't see the fates of the gods before Sliske's trickery because they had no souls to claim.\n\nBut yeah, none of them have post-godhood children otherwise. Guthix had one, but she was from before his ascension. Zamorak's a Mahjarrat and that whole process works nothing like normal biology. Saradomin's is adopted. None of the others, AFAIK, had kids.",

Granted azzy is a new god, but Saradomin and Zammy are both much more powerful then Azzy currently is.\n\nMahjarrat children are born from a ritual, rather then intercourse, although i think its implied to be basically Mahjarrats version of Intercourse, they aren't birthed the same way. \n\nSaradomin likely has the problem the same way the Hulk does in old man logan. Nobody can take it because hes so much stronger then a mortal on a fundamental level. Even the slightest miscalculation would just cause him to smash the lover to atoms. \n\nIm pretty sure the people on Terragard would have loved to have figured out a way for Saradomin to sire a child, im sure they'd have had the magical expertise/technology to do so. But Saradomin was a crusaider above all else. He never would have stuck around for long enough to attempt it."
