If you're looking for a clan, or if you're recruiting for a clan that needs more members, this is the place to post!\n\nIf you're advertising for a clan, please limit advertisements to 1 per clan - check to see if someone else in your clan has already posted. Include the clan name, a link to the official RuneScape clan page (and Discord server if applicable), and any requirements for joining.\n\nClans that advertise here are updated in our [Clans List](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/clans). If you are a clan leader and you want your clan to be added to the list, send a [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/runescape) with the relevant clan information.\n\nIf you're looking for a clan, include enough information about yourself to allow other RedditScapers to make good recommendations. For example, if you enjoy combat and are looking for a combat-oriented clan, you should include your stats/equipment and degree of combat experience.\n\nThere's a wide variety of clans to choose from: bossing- and skilling-oriented; general social, role-playing, and lore clans; clans focused around minigames and achievements, and specialist clans for ironmen and other account builds.\n\n[(Past Clan Saturday threads)](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/search?q=%22Clan+Saturday%22+author%3AAutoModerator&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)",
