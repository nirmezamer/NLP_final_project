Diego fights with reckless abandon, is massive at 145, has been extremely active, and I feel can dictate where this fight goes. Sure Ortega has tons of experience against top level competition, but Diego looks like a world beater, and someone who\u2019s destined to challenge for the belt.",

            "There's no real answer here other than bet smart and get lucky.\n\nAny real guaranteed strategy to roll through would need a bigger bankroll and likely other books. You could hedge or arb in that case but it's no easy task and books are getting better at picking up on these patterns.",

            "hmm yeah ask them to cancel the bonus. Otherwise, depending on how much $ you have, if you have money in other books, you may use an odds screen to make arbitrage bets. Without software, MLB moneylines with starting pitcher selected can sometimes be a way to do it. \n\nYou want to bust that account & have the money go into a different account essentially.",
            "Contact their customer service. Sometimes they will cancel the rollover bonus.",
