            "Been runnin' hot for a minute. Regression is sure to hit me sooner or later - here's to hoping later.\n\nHad my best ever Tapology finish (2nd out of over 5,000) a few weeks ago for the [Cannonier/Imavov card](https://www.tapology.com/ue/111458-4166363.png) - only miss on that minefield was my dumbass Moises selection (yeah, I know - Tomar got a gift from the judges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sf9xod2zxk7d1.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=71182700e4fd652c2a6a6516f6c2709fb7e1be44\n\n|Pick|Units\\*|Odds|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ikram Aliskerov|1.50|+122|\n|Johnny Walker|1.00|-118|\n|Filipe Lima|0.50|+110|\n|S. Pavlovich + T. Aspinall|3.75|+129|\n|~~R. Fakhretdinov + S. Magomedov~~|~~1.00~~|~~-105~~|\n\n*\\*Units are rounded for simplicity. I prefer to risk an amount to win units in 0.25 increments (ex. I'm risking $388 to win $500 on Pavlovich/Aspinall but rounded it to 3.75 units risked)*\n\n**BEWARE**\n\nI didn't realize Pavlovich trains with Volkov when I placed this bet on May 16th.\n\nThis is sketchy because if you watch Pavlovich's fight vs. his training partner Mikhail Mokhnatkin in 2017, this is a eerily similar situation. The result? The two training partners threw pillows for 25 minutes in a super boring championship fight.\n\nOn the plus side, Pavlovich showed he can go 5 rounds (just kidding, they literally sparred for 25 minutes...). I will be watching the interviews over the next two days very closely.\n\nI can't imagine they would have a gentlemen's agreement to fucking SPAR in the UFC with both being so close to title contention - but you never know with these Russians.\n\nOnly prop I will consider touching is over 1.5, over 2.5 and fight goes to decision - but this is hinged on the upcoming interviews.\n\nI've got just over 25 units on the line between this weekend and UFC 304 - This is going to be a long stretch of 6 weeks but I'm feeling good about it. Still targeting 50 units profit for 2024.\n\nGood luck my degenerate brothers!\n\n**Edit 06/21/24 11:20 PM EST:** \n\n1. Removed Fakhretdinov/Magomedov parlay due to Magomedov being re-booked\n2. Increased stake on Ikram Aliskerov",
            "Aliskerov being a short dog, doesn't have 5rd experience, huge step up in competition, inflated price considering his name this setup kinda reminds me of the Buckley-Ruziboev fight a few weeks ago.  Whittaker's durability is mostly faded, but I'm skeptical of Aliskerov's finishing ability at the world class level, gotta lean favorite",
            "There\u2019s a new Dagestani in town\u2026 Ikram w incoming \ud83d\udc4a",
            "[Pavlovich/Volkov exchange (roughly) translated:](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nKRhDi0x4c8)\n\n* **Volkov:** \u201cWhy did you say that I was the first to agree to the fight?\u201d\n* **Pavlovich:** \u201cWell, you yourself said right away that you would fight.\u201d\n* **Dana White:** \"Thanks guys, everyone\"\n* **Volkov:** \u201cNo, no, no. You said that if I fight, you will fight too. Is this a refusal?\n* **Pavlovich nods his head**\n* **Volkov:** \u201cYou didn\u2019t say that you wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d\n* **Pavlovich:** \u201cAli said...\u201d \\*further unintelligible\n* **Dana White:** \"I have no idea what you're talking about, good luck tomorrow\"\n* **Volkov:** \u201cAli told me when you already said that you would fight.\u201d\n\nEdit: I don't think Volkov is too excited about this affair",
            "Anyone whose followed the UFC for long enough seen a Volkov VS Pavlovich situation before?\n\nTwo good friends and sparring partners who don\u2019t want to fight each other? IIRC they even said they didn\u2019t want to take the fight because they were so close.\n\nDo these fights end up being low volume decisions? Or do they end quick because they just want to get out of there?",
            "If you can\u2019t wait for Fight Night, PFL has a decent card tomorrow. Rob Wilkinson + Impa now going off at almost even money after Impa\u2019s odds dropped considerably.\n\nPFL card is at elevation in Salt Lake, so beware fighters with tank concerns.",

WOOF\u2026WOOF WOOF\u2026WOOF WOOF.\n\n__Aliskerov +130 1u +115 4u__  (had Bobby Knucks at +210 vs Chimaev but give me the +115 on Aliskerov. I worry about Rob\u2019s ability to protect his jaw for 5 rounds, or 1 round, really. I do not think Ikram will be lulled into a point fight. He\u2019s going to let the dogs out on Rob, who has become a world-class round-edger but is vulnerable when things go off-script. A last second switch to five rounds vs elite competition is a huge ask but I think Aliskerov has the talent to do it).\n\n__Volkov +165 0.5u +190 0.5u__ (Pav probably finds the early finish but if that doesn\u2019t happen I think Volkov\u2019s live.

It felt like the brakes were released from both sides, and then Turkey showed that they are the better team and won quite comfortably in the end.\nI was impressed by Turkey's attack and I much believe that they can create some problems for the Portuguese defence.\n\nPortugal have more to add around their attacking game with the quality they have, there aren't very many games so far where the favorites have run over their opponents, and I don't think it will happen here either.\nTurkey I think is an all around good team, and I truly believe they can put up a good effort against any team. Also the support they have in Germany is incredible as there is many Turks living in Germany which can be a huge uplift for Turkey.\n\nI think we\u2019ll see goals from both sides, and that we\u2019ll see an entertaining game at one of my favourite stadiums Signal Iduna Park.\n\nBOL",

Moving onto the most attackable game today IMO where we should see plenty of points and decent weather compared to Sydney....\n\n**Event:** Gold Coast Titans vs NZ Warriors \n\n**Time:** 3:00 PM AEST 22/06 \n\n**Bookie**: Ladbrokes\n\n**Play:** Anytime Tryscorer, Montoya \n\n**Odds**: $1.94 (AUS) or -105 (US) \n\n**Units:** 1.25 Units \n\n**Analysis:** This is a pure stats play here and if you\u2019ve been around this group long enough, you probably know where this is going. Titans were completely woeful last week, beyond bad and to lose to the Tigers\u2026.. Shameful honestly. They get a nice inclusion and if there was any shining light out of that game, Kini looks a solid prospect in fullback. They get David Fifita back in for this match, big in for them. Warriors coming in with a weird loss to a good Melbourne team where they really put it on them - for 30 mins, then folded. They lose DWZ, Berry, Barnett and Capewell which are all good players but their main backline and forward pack stays relatively intact in key positions. This really comes down to historical stats for me. Titans are just a bag of shit, excuse the french, in terms of their middle defence where they\u2019ve allowed 30 tries through their middle so far this season. Can you guess where Warriors are ranked 2nd overall in terms of the offence and have scored 28 tries so far this year? You guessed it, their middle. AFB has been on fire in terms of tries for a front rower this year, scoring 6 tries in 2024 so far and while I don\u2019t love the idea of consistently backing a front rower for tries. With an area of success this big and an area of weakness that wide, you kind of have to go back to the well at the price. AFB scored last time these two faced each other earlier in the year and I genuinely think if the Warriors are smart and continue their trends, they\u2019ll have him running second off the ball close to the line and hit him through a gap. Titans are weak as piss on their line specifically centrally in defence and you\u2019re not stopping a guy like AFB that close with that mentality. Jojo Fifita out on the right wing, expecting Te Maire Martin to really keep developing this left edge as they have scored over 42% of their tries in the last few weeks with Johnston out. I think with Titans right edge missing Jojo and the Warriors missing DWZ on their right, think the left could be very fruitful today. Pompey been in good form also and if they have early success there, expect them to continue attacking that edge. 1.94 for a Warriors winger against a dreadful Titans defence is absolute juice IMO. Montoya been in relatively good form with 3 tries in 4 games and a double in his last match against the Storm. With a stunted backline of the Titans and a late out of Fifita, DWZ out on the right, I think the Warriors left edge might be on today and given how BAD the weather is in Sydney, feel like this is the match to attack today. Getting this price on a consistent Warriors winger who can finish, IMO this should closer to 1.50-1.60. I think it's the best play today! GL\n\n**LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE TAILING.

Even his bad splits are better than most pitchers good splits.\u00a0 He is always available, pitching 180+ innings the last two seasons while maintaining a sub 4 ERA and this season through 98 innings has a sub 3 ERA and is on pace for 200+ innings.\u00a0 Righties OPS .629 and Lefties OPS .537 against Gilbert.\u00a0 2 of the top 4 offensive producers bat from the left side for the Marlins in Jazz and Jesus Sanchez, so outside of De La Cruz and Josh Bell, Gilbert should be able to work his way through this lineup without much push back.\u00a0 In June, Gilbert has thrown 21 & 2/3 with only 4 earned runs.\u00a0 I mean c\u2019mon.  \n  \nSeattle\u2019s offense is usually nothing to write home about, but for what it\u2019s worth, they have brought themselves back up to a more palpable .735 OPS over the last week compared to their .670 season average.\u00a0 The Marlins will most likely run out a slew of arms in a bullpen game, so there is no judging what the offense will truly face from a matchup perspective.\u00a0 What I do know is that some homie named Shaun Anderson is getting the ball first and he has a negative career WAR and a flat 6 ERA in 141 career innings.\u00a0 They do not want to be fighting to avoid the sweep on Sunday.\u00a0 So sign me up for a Mariners bounce back to tie the series up.\n\nCheerz,  \nKBC",

Let's keep it rolling.\n\n**Pick: New York Yankees F5 ML -140 (MLB, 1u bet)**\n\nThe Yankees are coming off an 8-1 loss to the Braves on Friday, but I like them to bounce back today. New York has been good at home all year, and over the last month they are 3rd in batting average and 1st in both OPS and wRC+ against right handed pitching. They've also had success against Charlie Morton, as the current lineup is batting .310 with a .922 OPS across 166 plate appearances. Soto in particular has feasted in this matchup with 7 hits, 3 home runs, and 5 walks in 16 plate appearances. On the other side, Atlanta ranks bottom 10 in the same metrics over the last month and when you look at road games, they rank dead last in all 3. Now the lineup does have decent numbers against Stroman, batting .299 with a .737 OPS in 69 plate appearances, but Stroman is good at inducing ground balls so I still think the New York offense has the advantage here, and we get the push protection even if it is a little juiced. The Yankees also have a great F5 record at home and I don't really want to have the bullpens come into play for this bet.",

Before Latrell returned, South Sydney were a mess to start the season and during the time Cameron Murray was out, there was absolutely no structure to Souths middle. \n\nAdmitted Manly have a tonne of stars out as well but they've got a versatile bench and more importantly, probably the best half in this game in Brooks. They're gonna have real problems containing Souths left edge because Schoupp and Saab are terrible defensively but Souths won't be able to match their speed on the edges either.

Yesterday was a really solid day for my plays going 3-1 for +2.11u! Haven\u2019t been able to stay over that +30u for the season so hopefully I can break through and stay there after today. Last month\u2019s results in the comments.\n\nI\u2019ll be back throughout the day with updated model output and my plays. Make sure to stay tuned for that!\n\nHappy to answer any questions. BOL!",
            "Baseball sucks.  \n\nBring on September football.",
            "I refuse to believe that people can legitimately make any money on this sport in the long run. 162 games just presents way too much volatility, regardless of whether a team is good or bad. \n\nAnd here I still am. Because I'm an idiot",
            "This has been the worst month I've ever had",
            "what is going on? i keep loosing all the fucking games. may have to break boys",
            "Bruh this last week has been insane.",
            "**Model Record: 254-215, +38.80U**\u00a0*(54.16% Win Pct, 7.84% ROI)*\n\n[My Picks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJFx15ySqW2uSVSOmFowuxqjRHdKZSNPt4POLgPeoaI/edit#gid=0)\n\nYesterday's Record: 2-7, -5.05U \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\n\nThat was a horrifying night of baseball. It speaks volumes when my two biggest longshots were also my only two wins of the night. It\u2019s hard to believe I was up over 50 units just 5 days ago as well. I\u2019m officially \ud83e\udd76. \n\nIn other news, I added a new tab to the model called the team simulator. It replicates what I use to evaluate any given matchup. All you have to do is plug in a team score for each team, and the numbers will run itself. For my team score in the example, I took team pitching ERA, weighted it with starter era, and combined it with team runs per game. (All multiplied by 100)\n\nSaturday picks:\n\nTigers -155\n\nGiants -103\n\nAthletics +143\n\nReds +112\n\nGuardians -138\n\nYankees -139\n\nBOL everyone, more to come later. Remember, baseball can be very random, but over the long haul the randomness is more helpful than hurtful."
