            "I loved my Boston 12s for 50 mile weeks during marathon training, but I'm finding now on shorter, faster runs for 5k training the heel feels a little unstable, almost too narrow when I make even the most gradual turns (at one point I almost lost my footing going around the turn on a track). Have I just worn these to death at this point or is this a common experience? And if so does anyone have recommendations for alternatives with that same kind of snappy feel but maybe a little less narrow in the backside?",
            "I'm coming from the barefoot shoe movement - I've previously ran in sandals, altra escalante racer, etc. I've developed some tendinopathy in my left achilles and am thinking about getting something wiht a bit of a heel raise while I rehab, in hopes of being able to run more. Does this sound... reasonable? wise? Any recs on shoes with a wide toebox but high drop? Should I just get a heel lift?",

            "Is it just me or are Adidas shoes too long in the heel? I put on a pair of Supernova Rises in the store and almost fell in love, but it feels like they're slipping off in the back even with a strong heel lock. If this can be fixed with lacing, I'd 100% get a pair and be happy.",

Im currently running in the Lone Peak 5 and love the toebox, but have found myself tripping and falling almost every other trail run. I know its partly my stride and foot but if theres some sort of shoe that can help me be more stable, would appreciate it!\n\nWhen Ive fallen, its been downhill and on a small rock.",
            "I'm using Adios 8 and when I try to use them for intervals/speed sessions, sometimes I feel like the forefoot area is getting too hot. Mainly due to me being a forefoot/midfoot striker and at the same time the forefoot stack being a bit thin. Is this normal to feel with this type of shoe?",
            "Hi there! I've been looking for some time for a replacement for my old Nike Tempo Next because I havent put many kms on them but the upper is already almost gone. I've mostly use them for tempo runs but specially for bike run transition. I love them because I feel that the air pod helps me with muscle fatigue. Is there a similar shoe around? I've looked into the asics superblast and I've seen the endorphin speed also thrown around but I don't know if they will check the box of the muscle fatigue thing. Do you guys have any recommendations?",

            "I have my first marathon in November after doing a few HMs in my AP3. They have done ok. Im older, not a lightweight (170/77kg), forefoot/midfoot striker with wide-ish forefeet. Not sure if for the marathon I stick with the AP3 or look for something more cushioned? I dont expect to break 4h, maybe close, so dont need anything overly aggressive. At this point kind of eyeing SC Elite v4, but also not sure if I should just stick with AP3 - I need to try them on a 16+ miler still."

        "content": "I\u2019m 42 years old, male, 5\u201910\u201d, and approximately 205 lbs (92.9kg). Half marathon 2:09:28, 10K 1:00:28, 5K 26:10. I only put 200+ miles on my original Superblast but I liked them so much (after breaking them in), I bought a second pair. I\u2019m recovering from an injury so my doctor has me limited to 30 minute recovery effort runs. I completed my first 2.5 mile (4k) run with an average pace of 11:51/mile (7:22/km). At the time of this review, I have already completed another 2.5 mile (4k) run with a similar pace.\n\nI\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s the same Superblast with a few quality of life improvements. If you liked the Superblast, you\u2019ll love the Superblast 2. If you didn\u2019t, I would still consider the Superblast 2 due to the improvements.\n\nFor other fellow slower, heavier runners, I\u2019m pleased to say that the ride is less harsh out the box. I remember despising the original Superblast when I first ran in them because they felt too firm for my slower pace. To me, the Superblast 2 feels similar to a 75% broken in Superblast. I\u2019m excited to see if it still softens up just a bit around 50ish miles. Even if it doesn\u2019t, the out of box comfort is an improvement over the original.\n\nThe changes to the outsole are minor but significant. No more hitchhiking rocks when you run on gravel or crushed granite. Additionally, the grip was noticeably better as I ran through small puddles on the sidewalk and roadway while turning.\n\nTo me, these 3 changes further solidify its role as a do-it-all shoe. Don\u2019t be alarmed if the shoe feels  a little shorter than the original on the first step in. After lacing up and walking around for a moment, I rechecked the fit and it seemed that my heel had become more secure in the heel counter and they now fit identical to my original Superblast. I\u2019m looking forward to making a full recovery, getting back to long runs, and picking up the pace with these.\n\n\n",

            "Thank you for this review!!! Similar body type and running style, this is so helpful to me. Can you share your thoughts on the firmness of the cushion? Like, for example, I have the nova blast 3's which were like perfect-bouncy out the gate, but after 3 runs it compressed and now I only walk in them. I think those were only ever gonna get me 3-4 mi at a time even if I was lighter. Are these superblasts a little firmer/tougher and designed for longer runs? I have the Boston 11 and 12s, but when they get retired, I may look to asics, I'm loving their trail shoes",
            "Am I crazy to say these are a complete waste of money for slow running? Of course its versatile and can do it but the whole point of these is to be a long distance faster shoe. The triumph, Novablast, glycerin and nimbus would all be just as good or even better at slow paces. I dont mean any disrespect to anyone so I hope it doesnt come off that way but people are getting swept up in marketing hype",
            "How is the uppers breathability?",
            "Great review. I am a heel striker and slow runner and I died finds the Superblast harsh at slower pace.. I understand that the fit length wise is identical? Can you compare the length and width of the two insoles? If they are the same I will go TTS. "

Took it out for a quick 3 mile run with the below pace:\n\nMile 1- 8:34 Mile 2- 8:41 Mile 3- 8:44\n\nOverall, this shoe is making me super spoiled. It is very snappy and has a great response to it where I feel like I am being propelled forward for every step. Also, thank you to the other Redditors on here.

Knowing there would be a heel slip I used runners knot which did work and K experienced pretty much Zero no heel slipping. However, throught 18km run I just did today I went through periods of enjoying them and absolutely hating them..\n\nFirst kms were ok then bottom of my feet started hurt really really bad, like balls of my feet and below I think. After 13km I needed to pee (also my feet hurt) so I stopped for like 2 minutes. The pain went away and then my feet were ok pretty much for the rest of the run. Then as I walked back home with coffee in my hand I could feel bottom of my feet again. Its weird, do these need break in? \n\nI can tell they are miles from softness of previous 2 versions. They are still bouncy but waaaay more firm. \n\nI think I am going to try and suffer through couple more runs and I hope the shoe will eventually give in. \n\n\n",

Currently dont wear them anymore since I switched to superblast, however when I wore the invincible it could EAT miles and ran several 300+ miles months leading up to my first marathon last fall. Never had any heel slippage issues, still not even sure what that means. They were a fantastic fit and happily retired two pairs with still a decent amount of tread remaining.",

            "Love them. Just bought a second pair. I don't get the heel slip, they feel like they are going to slip but never do. I think it's because the heel padding is just a little lower than the v2 so it feels too low.",
            "I have the 3's and also had the 1's. The heal slip is my main problem, I have to have them supertight to stop it from happening. The 1's were awesome and literally started to fall apart after 1200km's when I then bought the 3s. I actually don't notice much difference in the softness compared to the 1s but overall fit was definitely a step backwards. I've now down 600 kms and  am on the look out for my next recovery / easy long run shoe and it won't be the Invincible 3.",
            "This shoe was terrible for me. Crazy heel slip and had pain near ball of foot and on a 12 mile run I would say at about  mile 9 I felt as if my foot was sliding everywhere in the shoe and could not get good footing no matter what I did.(Also worth noting Im a mid foot striker) shoes werent too big as I am a 10-10.5 in all my other shoes and I got these in a 10. Recently I purchased the gel nimbus 26 in a 10.5 and the shoe fits like a glove with no problems. Probably will toss the invincible 3s unfortunately as I see no point in holding on to them."
