            "I loved my Boston 12s for 50 mile weeks during marathon training, but I'm finding now on shorter, faster runs for 5k training the heel feels a little unstable, almost too narrow when I make even the most gradual turns (at one point I almost lost my footing going around the turn on a track). Have I just worn these to death at this point or is this a common experience? And if so does anyone have recommendations for alternatives with that same kind of snappy feel but maybe a little less narrow in the backside?",
            "I'm coming from the barefoot shoe movement - I've previously ran in sandals, altra escalante racer, etc. I've developed some tendinopathy in my left achilles and am thinking about getting something wiht a bit of a heel raise while I rehab, in hopes of being able to run more. Does this sound... reasonable? wise? Any recs on shoes with a wide toebox but high drop? Should I just get a heel lift?",
            "I'm a new runner, doing 2/3 5k's a week (pace between 5-6 min/km), sometimes extending a run to 10k max. Been running with my Ultraboost 1.0s and they aren't made for running obviously lol, so looking to swap to something else. I saw the recommendations in the FAQ and it gets overwhelming on how to decide what to pick, even when using RunRepeat since they are all scored in the same 85-90 range. \n\nSo looking to get some more direct feedback when it comes to those recommended shoes/alternatives.\n\nI bought the Saucony Axon 3 on amazon at 100$ shipped which was the cheapest I found, despite it not being part of the new runner recs (has not arrived yet, will feel them out and then return if don't like). \n\nAre they good shoes? I try to strike on my forefoot most of the time, and as I get tired I end up running midfoot, avoid heel striking as much as I can since I come from a knee injury recently. Am 135 lbs, 5'6, with narrow-mid feet of size 7-8. \n\nShould I opt to get one of [the other new runner recommended ones under Q3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/wiki/index#wiki_common_questions)?",

            "Looking for recommendations to replace my Saucony Ride 14's, which are starting to come apart at the seams!\n\nI travel a lot and mainly run on a treadmill, but occasionally run outdoors as well. Distance tends to be 5-10k, pace tends to be under 5:00/k.\n\nI've been having a look at options, but it seems that in the past few years since I got my current pair, most brands/lines seem to have shifted to having very bulky, cushioned heels, which doesn't fit as well with the whole travel thing and getting things in my suitcase...\n\nAny recommendations for lighter/less bulky neutral shoes, or are the bulkier style that seem common now actually worthwhile?",

I\u2019m currently running in the Lone Peak 5 and love the toebox, but have found myself tripping and falling almost every other trail run.

Took it out for a quick 3 mile run with the below pace:\n\nMile 1- 8:34 Mile 2- 8:41 Mile 3- 8:44\n\nOverall, this shoe is making me super spoiled. It is very snappy and has a great response to it where I feel like I am being propelled forward for every step. Also, thank you to the other Redditors on here. I only bought them because many of you that own this model said you don\u2019t have to be a pro to own or run in them and should purchase something you enjoy!

        "content": "I\u2019m 42 years old, male, 5\u201910\u201d, and approximately 205 lbs (92.9kg). Half marathon 2:09:28, 10K 1:00:28, 5K 26:10. I only put 200+ miles on my original Superblast but I liked them so much (after breaking them in), I bought a second pair. I\u2019m recovering from an injury so my doctor has me limited to 30 minute recovery effort runs. I completed my first 2.5 mile (4k) run with an average pace of 11:51/mile (7:22/km). At the time of this review, I have already completed another 2.5 mile (4k) run with a similar pace.\n\nI\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s the same Superblast with a few quality of life improvements. If you liked the Superblast, you\u2019ll love the Superblast 2. If you didn\u2019t, I would still consider the Superblast 2 due to the improvements.\n\nFor other fellow slower, heavier runners, I\u2019m pleased to say that the ride is less harsh out the box. I remember despising the original Superblast when I first ran in them because they felt too firm for my slower pace. To me, the Superblast 2 feels similar to a 75% broken in Superblast. I\u2019m excited to see if it still softens up just a bit around 50ish miles. Even if it doesn\u2019t, the out of box comfort is an improvement over the original.\n\nThe changes to the outsole are minor but significant. No more hitchhiking rocks when you run on gravel or crushed granite. Additionally, the grip was noticeably better as I ran through small puddles on the sidewalk and roadway while turning.\n\nTo me, these 3 changes further solidify its role as a do-it-all shoe. Don\u2019t be alarmed if the shoe feels  a little shorter than the original on the first step in. After lacing up and walking around for a moment, I rechecked the fit and it seemed that my heel had become more secure in the heel counter and they now fit identical to my original Superblast. I\u2019m looking forward to making a full recovery, getting back to long runs, and picking up the pace with these.\n\n\n",

Then as I walked back home with coffee in my hand I could feel bottom of my feet again. Its weird, do these need break in? \n\nI can tell they are miles from softness of previous 2 versions.
