The lease is all through a real estate.\n\nWe suspect this is due to the fact he is planning on moving in once the lease is up in march 2025.\n\nShe has even woken up during the day to him being in the kids room doing work.\n\nHer biggest concern is that she has 2 young children, and does a lot of night shift as a nurse.\n\nWhat should her next steps be?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses.",

            "Your employer will argue that the briefing ensures you start actual work duties at the designated time of 9am and if you only arrived at 9am then you would not be ready to commence work duties at start time. IANAL but I\u2019ve written policies around similar things that ensure employees don\u2019t just rock up to work 10 seconds before the bell then spend 20mins on the lunch room socialising. If you are punching a time card earlier than start time then this is a strong argument that you might be owed more wages and you might be able to argue that if you decide to take the fight to the fair work ombudsman. But in reality if there is no requirement to arrive at work earlier than a minute or two then just go ahead and do that. But take care that your duties commence at a specific time such as 9am and you are expected to begin doing productive works at that time and if the briefing is a non compulsory pre work meeting that is encouraged then take care of you decide to rock the boat and not attend those meetings that your shifts may be given to others who don\u2019t object to the 10 mins ahead of work time that they attend daily to be told what is expected of them for that shift.
