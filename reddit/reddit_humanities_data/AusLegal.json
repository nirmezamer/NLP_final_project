It's then up to you to do your due diligence. if they don't then the REA hasn't disclosed correctly and the offer may have been null and void anyway.\n\nBit strange though to put down a deposit and offer before seeing the strata details,\n\nI'd assume unless you made your offer subject to \"seeing strata details\" then the recourse would be minimal."

Or new tenants to move in after the previous person was evicted because they didn't pay their bill and the landlord had to go through a whole process because nobody allowed the inmate to communicate with them.\n\nThe way they set this up and the treatment of inmates once they are inside make it *extremely* difficult for them to manage their affairs.

We set up the kids play room, where we spend the bulk of our time in the smaller room, thinking it would be easier to heat ect. \n\nWith Winter getting colder (we live in western Victoria) we decided to start using the gas heater in the play room but it had a funny smell that made us uncomfortable. So we got the REA to send out a plumber to do a safety check despite the entry report saying a safety inspection was done last November. \n\nThe Plumber told us that while he couldn\u2019t detect any Gas the last inspection showed it FAILED it\u2019s pressure test and should have been disconnected due to safety reasons so he disconnected it on the spot. We asked about the other one but he said it was already disconnected for safety reasons. None of this was disclosed when we moved in.\n\nThe living room does have a small split system but it really struggles to heat the whole living room. It has no hope oh heating both living areas.  I\u2019m going to request the REA install adequate heating in both rooms but I\u2019m worried that since the main living room has the split system already they will just say no.\n\nDoes the fact we rented it thinking it had proper gas heating (when it doesn\u2019t) make a difference?
