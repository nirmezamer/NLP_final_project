        "content": "I was given a 90-day notice period and about 8 months severance at my job where I'd been a lead software developer for over 9 years. My role along with 400 others were eliminated one fine day recently. My wife works at another company that earns a lot higher salary than mine already. I've been working on my game for the past year and a half and this job was honestly affecting my mental health a lot. It was never about the work anymore and there were lots of politics going on. This lay off was inevitable but still a shock to my system.\n\nI've hated working in corporate since the last 2-3 years because it always took a lot of time away from the game development. This lay off and with a generous severance should be some kind of sign right? My wife is 100% supportive of me whatever path I choose. She thinks I should go the game-dev route and use this time to start the business. I think I can make a working demo in 6-7 months from now, and finally begin marketing now. My problem is, I don't know anyone around me in this industry. Classmates, friends, family, they are all corporate junkies and will not understand this path I take. My dad might, he used to be a business owner here and there in the 90s and 2000s. I really feel this urge to start my own business and really kickstart the game studio but not sure if anyone has thought of this in a similar situation.\n\nHas anyone gone through this? Or am I alone in this endeavor?",

            "Have you ever released a commercial game before? If not you shouldn't consider this going full-time in a new business. You're not likely to make a lot of money from solo game development. You don't need to know anyone else doing it, it's just that it's a very rare game actually made by one person (it's a lot easier to make something good when everyone can be an expert in a different skill), and it takes a lot of experience (and investment) to make something people really want to play. You also likely don't want to start promotion 6 months before a demo (you'd start 6-7 months before final launch).\n\nThat being said, it sounds like you need a break. You could use a sabbatical and don't need to jump back into work right away, so spending some time working on a game, if you enjoy that, could be great for you. Just don't start working 60 hour weeks because you think your new solo start-up is going to replace your day job. Most likely you'll release it, get a few sales (some thousands if it's decent and you promote it well), and then you go back to software development somewhere. Treat this like a mental health break, not a new full-time career.",
            "You will just loose your precious life time what I did for months or years stuck in a OCD game dev solo experience struggling and being overwhelmed into a creep scope. If even you manage the end, your game will be instantly into the limbo, except you have a lot of money into marketing. Just make something to get busy until you get a new job.",
            "I'm on a pretty similar situation, but I've not been laid off. I'd love to, to be honest, as my current job is draining me mentally.\n\nSince your situation provides some security, it could be a great opportunity to develop your game demo, while networking within the industry. Use this time to both recover from your previous job, and to lay the groundwork for your game studio.",
            "Might as well try it for 3 months or so - you can always use the same business entity to do contract work too.\n\nThis was my idea if I were to get the same deal, but they only laid off my colleagues instead :(",

            "Are you willing to salary sacrifice? You could work at a game company and develop your chops, but the pay won't be any where as good as far as my undersstanding goes. But if your financial situation is ok, perhaps there's no harm spending a year or 2 working at a game development studio.\n\n8 months is a pretty good runway to find a game dev job.",
            "Youre in good financial shape, it sounds like, so to a degree, you might as well. But why start a business? Why not just start making something and figure out if you actually like it enough to treat it like a job first?",
