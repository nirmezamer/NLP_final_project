            "All sides together (double counting the corners) add up to 3\\*23=69. While the numbers 1 to 9 add up to 45. So there has to be 69-45=24 worth of numbers in the cornes, which is only possible if 7, 8, 9 are in the corners. Also since 2 and 6 are placed, the \"middle\" numbers of the left resp. right side can't add up to 8, so the 8 and 7 have to be in the bottom corners. Does this give a start?",
            "From top left to bottom right, what I found was\n\n>!9, 4, 1, 8, 5, 3, 7!<",
            "Three 23s sum to 69. We need this to be the total of all the numbers in the triangle with the three corners counted twice. The nine digits sum to 45, so we need those corners to provide the extra (69 - 45 = 24).\n\nThe only way to accomplish this is for the corners to be all three of the highest numbers: 7, 8, and 9.\n\nThe right side contains a 6, two corners which could be either 7+8, 7+9, or 8+9, and one other number. Those options sum to 21, 22, or 23, making the fourth number 2, 1, or 0. Because 2 has already been used and there is no 0, this side must be 6, 7, 9, and 1.\n\nTherefore we can place the 1 next to the 6. We don't know which of 7 and 9 goes in which of these corners, but we can place the 8 in the left corner.\n\nThe left side is now 8, 2, (7 or 9), and one other number. To sum to 23 the missing number is either 6 or 4. Because 6 has already been used, this side is 8, 2, 9, and 4. \n\nWe can now place the 4, 9, and 7. That leaves 3 and 5 to go on the bottom row - in either order - between the 8 and 7."
