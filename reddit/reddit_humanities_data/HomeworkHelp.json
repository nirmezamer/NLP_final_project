        "content": "Hi r/HomeworkHelp! Whether you're new to the subreddit or a long-time subscriber, the mod team would like to remind everybody of the subreddit rules we expect you to follow here.\n\nNo advertising, soliciting, or spam. This is a place for free help. Anyone offering to pay for help, or to help for pay, will receive a permanent ban. This is your warning. This includes asking users to go into DMs, Discord, or anywhere else. If you post anything that looks like you're trying to get around this rule, you'll be banned.\n\nIf you're asking for help, you must show evidence of thought, work, and effort. A lot of people are posting just pictures or lists of questions and not showing any effort. These posts are liable to be taken down.\n\nIn addition, we ask that you format the post title appropriately using square brackets: **\\[Level/Grade and Subject\\] Question or Description of question**. For example: \\[8th grade Algebra\\] How to solve quadratic equation?\n\nDo not mention anything like \"Urgent\", \"ASAP\", \"Due in an hour\", or the like.\n\nNo surveys. Surveys (including requests for interviews, etc.) belong on [/r/samplesize](https://old.reddit.com/r/samplesize). These posts get taken down here.\n\nDon't be a jerk. Jerks get banned. Stay respectful and refrain from using insults, personal attacks, or abusive language.\n\nIf there are any questions, [please message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhomeworkhelp).",

            "All sides together (double counting the corners) add up to 3\\*23=69. While the numbers 1 to 9 add up to 45. So there has to be 69-45=24 worth of numbers in the cornes, which is only possible if 7, 8, 9 are in the corners. Also since 2 and 6 are placed, the \"middle\" numbers of the left resp. right side can't add up to 8, so the 8 and 7 have to be in the bottom corners. Does this give a start?",
