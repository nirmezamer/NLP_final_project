        "content": "Help me find this beagle plush?\n\nI got him a long time ago, around 2010, give or take a few years. He was purchased alongside a golden retriever and a pug, used to have a collar (red? I think?), and used to have a realistic hard plastic black nose. He had a tag on his left hind leg, but it was cut off a long time ago, so I have no idea what brand he is.\n\nSome unique details about him is that he has very short fur in a different fabric under his ears. He has 4 soft white paw pads, also with shorter fur, and 3 defined toes. He has a subtle smile on his face, and glass(?) eyes with brown irises.\n\nHe is about 8 inches from nose to rump, excluding tail. With his tail, he is about 11.5 inches. He is about 7 inches from the top of his head to the bottom of his front paw. He is about 6 inches from the top of his rump to the bottom of his back paw.\n\nHe's rather floppy around his belly, with less stuffing there. He has stiffer stuffing around his legs, head, and tail.\n\nIf anyone can help me find his clones, I'd greatly appreciate it!",
