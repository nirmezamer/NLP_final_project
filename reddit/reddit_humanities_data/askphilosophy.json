        "content": "#Welcome to /r/askphilosophy!\n\nWelcome to /r/askphilosophy! We're a community devoted to providing serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions. We aim to provide an academic Q&A-type space for philosophical questions, and welcome questions about all areas of philosophy. This post will go over our subreddit rules and guidelines that you should review *before* you begin posting here.\n\n#Table of Contents\n\n1.

Frequently Asked Questions\n\n___________________________________\n\n#A Note about Moderation\n\n/r/askphilosophy is moderated by a team of dedicated volunteer moderators who have spent years attempting to build the best philosophy Q&A platform on the internet. Unfortunately, the reddit admins have repeatedly made changes to this website which have made moderating subreddits harder and harder. In particular, reddit has recently announced that it will begin charging for access to API (Application Programming Interface, essentially the communication between reddit and other sites/apps). While this may be, in isolation, a reasonable business operation, the timeline and pricing of API access has threatened to put nearly all third-party apps, e.g. Apollo and RIF, out of business. You can read more about the history of this change [here](https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) or [here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges). You can also read more at [this post on our sister subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14ayod9/rphilosophy_will_indefinitely_be_in_restricted/).\n\nThese changes pose two major issues which the moderators of /r/askphilosophy are concerned about.\n\nFirst, the native reddit app is lacks accessibility features which are essential for some people, notably those who are blind and visually impaired. You can read /r/blind's protest announcement [here](https://reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/). These apps are the only way that many people can interact with reddit, given the poor accessibility state of the official reddit app. As philosophers we are particularly concerned with the ethics of accessibility, and support protests in solidarity with this community.\n\nSecond, the reddit app lacks many essential tools for moderation. While reddit [has promised better moderation tools on the app in the future](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), this is not enough. First, reddit has repeatedly broken promises regarding features, including moderation features. Most notably, reddit promised CSS support for new reddit [over six years ago](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), which has yet to materialize. Second, even if reddit follows through on the roadmap in the post linked above, many of the features will not come until well after June 30, when the third-party apps will shut down due to reddit's API pricing changes.\n\nOur moderator team relies heavily on these tools which will now disappear. Moderating /r/askphilosophy is a monumental task; over the past year we have flagged and removed over 6000 posts and 23000 comments. This is a huge effort, especially for unpaid volunteers, and it is possible only when moderators have access to tools that these third-party apps make possible and that reddit doesn't provide.\n\nWhile we [previously participated in the protests against reddit's recent actions](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/14ambf2/askphilosophy_is_now_in_restricted_mode/) we have decided to reopen the subreddit, because we are still proud of the community and resource that we have built and cultivated over the last decade, and believe it is a useful resource to the public. \n\nHowever, these changes have radically altered our ability to moderate this subreddit, which will result in a few changes for this subreddit. First, as noted above, from this point onwards only panelists may answer top level comments. Second, moderation will occur much more slowly; as we will not have access to mobile tools, posts and comments which violate our rules will be removed much more slowly, and moderators will respond to modmail messages much more slowly. Third, and finally, if things continue to get worse (as they have for years now) moderating /r/askphilosophy may become practically impossible, and we may be forced to abandon the platform altogether. We are as disappointed by these changes as you are, but reddit's insistence on [enshittifying this platform](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/), especially when it comes to moderation, leaves us with no other options. We thank you for your understanding and support.\n\n___________________________________\n\n#/r/askphilosophy's Mission\n\n/r/askphilosophy strives to be a community where anyone, regardless of their background, can come to get reasonably substantive and accurate answers to philosophical questions. This means that all questions must be philosophical in nature, and that answers must be reasonably substantive and accurate. What do we mean by that?\n\n#What is Philosophy?\n\nAs with most disciplines, \"philosophy\" has both a casual and a technical usage. \n\nIn its casual use, \"philosophy\" may refer to nearly any sort of thought or beliefs, and include topics such as religion, mysticism and even science. When someone asks you what \"your philosophy\" is, this is the sort of sense they have in mind; they're asking about your general system of thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.\n\nIn its technical use -- the use relevant here at /r/askphilosophy -- philosophy is a particular area of study which can be broadly grouped into several major areas, including:\n\n* Aesthetics, the study of beauty\n* Epistemology, the study of knowledge and belief\n* Ethics, the study of what we owe to one another\n* Logic, the study of what follows from what\n* Metaphysics, the study of the basic nature of existence and reality\n\nas well as various subfields of 'philosophy of X', including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and many others.\n\nPhilosophy in the narrower, technical sense that philosophers use and which /r/askphilosophy is devoted to is defined not only by its subject matter, but by its methodology and attitudes. Something is not philosophical merely because it states some position related to those areas. There must also be an emphasis on *argument* (setting forward reasons for adopting a position) and a willingness to subject arguments to various criticisms.\n\n#What Isn't Philosophy?\n\nAs you can see from the above description of philosophy, philosophy often crosses over with other fields of study, including art, mathematics, politics, religion and the sciences. That said, in order to keep this subreddit focused on philosophy we require that all posts be primarily philosophical in nature, and defend a distinctively philosophical thesis. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, something does not count as philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit if:\n\n* It does not address a philosophical topic or area of philosophy\n* It may more accurately belong to another area of study (e.g. religion or science)\n* No attempt is made to argue for a position's conclusions\n\nSome more specific topics which are popularly misconstrued as philosophical but do *not* meet this definition and thus are not appropriate for this subreddit include:\n\n* Drug experiences (e.g. \"I dropped acid today and experienced the oneness of the universe...\")\n* Mysticism (e.g. \"I meditated today and experienced the oneness of the universe...\")\n* Politics (e.g. \"This is why everyone should support the Voting Rights Act\")\n* Self-help (e.g. \"How can I be a happier person and have more people like me?\")\n* Theology (e.g. \"Can the unbaptized go to heaven, or at least to purgatory?\")\n\n#What is a Reasonably Substantive and Accurate Answer?\n\nThe goal of this subreddit is not merely to provide answers to philosophical questions, but answers which can further the reader's knowledge and understanding of the philosophical issues and debates involved. To that end, /r/askphilosophy is a *highly moderated* subreddit which only allows panelists to answer questions, and all answers that violate our posting rules will be removed. \n\nAnswers on /r/askphilosophy must be both reasonably substantive as well as reasonably accurate. This means that answers should be:\n\n* Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)\n* Accurately portray the state of research and the relevant literature (i.e. not inaccurate, misleading or false)\n* Come only from those with relevant knowledge of the question and issue (i.e. not from commenters who don't understand the state of the research on the question)\n\nAny attempt at moderating a public Q&A forum like /r/askphilosophy must choose a balance between two things:\n\n* More, but possibly insubstantive or inaccurate answers\n* Fewer, but more substantive and accurate answers\n\nIn order to further our mission, the moderators of /r/askphilosophy have chosen the latter horn of this dilemma. To that end, only panelists are allowed to answer questions on /r/askphilosophy.\n\n#What is a /r/askphilosophy Panelist?\n\n/r/askphilosophy panelists are trusted commenters who have applied to become panelists in order to help provide questions to posters' questions. These panelists are volunteers who have some level of knowledge and expertise in the areas of philosophy indicated in their flair.\n\n###What Do the Flairs Mean?\n\nUnlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flairs on r/askphilosophy are not to designate commenters' areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters' relevant expertise in philosophical areas. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence. Flair will thus be given to those with the relevant research expertise.\n\nFlair consists of two parts: a color indicating the type of flair, as well as up to three research areas that the panelist is knowledgeable about. \n\nThere are six types of panelist flair:\n\n* Autodidact (Light Blue): The panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in a field.\n\n* Undergraduate (Red): The panelist is enrolled in or has completed formal undergraduate coursework in Philosophy. In the US system, for instance, this would be indicated by a major (BA) or minor.\n\n* Graduate (Gold): The panelist is enrolled in a graduate program or has completed an MA in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their coursework might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a degree in Philosophy. For example, a student with an MA in Literature whose coursework and thesis were focused on Derrida's deconstruction might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to an MA in Philosophy.\n\n* PhD (Purple): The panelist has completed a PhD program in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their degree might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in Philosophy. For example, a student with a PhD in Art History whose coursework and dissertation focused on aesthetics and critical theory might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in philosophy.\n\n* Professional (Blue): The panelist derives their full-time employment through philosophical work outside of academia. Such panelists might include Bioethicists working in hospitals or Lawyers who work on the Philosophy of Law/Jurisprudence.\n\n* Related Field (Green): The panelist has expertise in some sub-field of philosophy but their work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy. For example, a PhD in Physics whose research touches on issues relating to the entity/structural realism debate clearly has expertise relevant to philosophical issues but is reasonably understood to be working primarily in another field.\n\nFlair will only be given in particular areas or research topics in philosophy, in line with the following guidelines:\n\n* Typical areas include things like \"philosophy of mind\", \"logic\" or \"continental philosophy\". \n* Flair will not be granted for specific research subjects, e.g. \"Kant on logic\", \"metaphysical grounding\", \"epistemic modals\".\n* Flair of specific philosophers will only be granted if that philosopher is clearly and uncontroversially a monumentally important philosopher (e.g. Aristotle, Kant).\n* Flair will be given in a maximum of three research areas.\n\n###How Do I Become a Panelist?\n\nTo become a panelist, please [send a message to the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) with the subject \"Panelist Application\". In this modmail message you must include all of the following:\n\n1. The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).\n2. The areas of flair you are requesting, up to three (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).\n3. A brief explanation of your background in philosophy, including what qualifies you for the flair you requested.\n4. One sample answer to a question posted to /r/askphilosophy for each area of flair (i.e. up to three total answers) which demonstrate your expertise and knowledge. Please link the question you are answering before giving your answer. You may not answer your own question. \n\nNew panelists will be approved on a trial basis. During this trial period panelists will be allowed to post answers as top-level comments on threads, and will receive flair. After the trial period the panelist will either be confirmed as a regular panelist or will be removed from the panelist team, which will result in the removal of flair and ability to post answers as top-level comments on threads.\n\nNote that r/askphilosophy does **not** require users to provide proof of their identifies for panelist applications, nor to reveal their identities. If a prospective panelist would like to provide proof of their identity as part of their application they may, but there is no presumption that they must do so. Note that messages sent to modmail cannot be deleted by either moderators or senders, and so any message sent is effectively permanent.\n\n___________________________________\n\n#/r/askphilosophy's Posting Rules\n\nIn order to best serve our mission of providing an academic Q&A-type space for philosophical questions, we have the following rules which govern all posts made to /r/askphilosophy:\n\n###PR1: All questions must be about philosophy.\n> All questions must be about philosophy. Questions which are only tangentially related to philosophy or are properly located in another discipline will be removed. Questions which are about therapy, psychology and self-help, even when due to philosophical issues, are not appropriate and will be removed.\n\n###PR2: All submissions must be questions.\n> All submissions must be actual questions (as opposed to essays, rants, personal musings, idle or rhetorical questions, etc.). \"Test My Theory\" or \"Change My View\"-esque questions, paper editing, etc. are not allowed.\n\n###PR3: Post titles must be descriptive.\n> Post titles must be descriptive. Titles should indicate what the question is about. Posts with titles like \"Homework help\" which do not indicate what the actual question is will be removed.\n\n###PR4: Questions must be reasonably specific.\n> Questions must be reasonably specific. Questions which are too broad to the point of unanswerability will be removed.\n\n###PR5: Questions must not be about commenters' personal opinions.\n> Questions must not be about commenters' personal opinions, thoughts or favorites. /r/askphilosophy is not a discussion subreddit, and is not intended to be a board for everyone to share their thoughts on philosophical questions.\n\n###PR6: One post per day.\n> One post per day. Please limit yourself to one question per day.\n\n###PR7: Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract.\n> /r/askphilosophy is not a mental health subreddit, and panelists are not experts in mental health or licensed therapists. Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch. If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting /r/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate permanent ban.\n\n#/r/askphilosophy's Commenting Rules\nIn the same way that our posting rules above attempt to promote our mission by governing posts, the following commenting rules attempt to promote /r/askphilosophy's mission to provide an academic Q&A-type space for philosophical questions.\n\n###CR1: Top level comments must be answers or follow-up questions.\n> All top level comments should be answers to the submitted question or follow-up/clarification questions. All top level comments must come from [panelists](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists). If users circumvent this rule by posting answers as replies to other comments, these comments will also be removed and may result in a ban. For more information about our rules and to find out how to become a panelist, please see [here](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists).\n\n###CR2: Answers must be reasonably substantive and accurate.\n> All answers must be informed and aimed at helping the OP and other readers reach an understanding of the issues at hand. Answers must portray an accurate picture of the issue and the philosophical literature. Answers should be reasonably substantive. To learn more about what counts as a reasonably substantive and accurate answer, see [this post](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/14o2p7n/welcome_to_raskphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/?).\n\n###CR3: Be respectful.\n>Be respectful. Comments which are rude, snarky, etc. may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Racism, bigotry and use of slurs are absolutely not permitted.\n\n###CR4: Stay on topic.\n>Stay on topic. Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed.\n\n###CR5: No self-promotion.\n> Posters and comments may not engage in self-promotion, including linking their own blog posts or videos. Panelists may link their own peer-reviewed work in answers (e.g. peer-reviewed journal articles or books), but their answers should not consist solely of references to their own work.\n\n###Miscellaneous Posting and Commenting Guidelines\n\nIn addition to the rules above, we have a list of miscellaneous guidelines which users should also be aware of:\n\n* Reposting a post or comment which was removed will be treated as circumventing moderation and result in a permanent ban.\n* Using follow-up questions or child comments to answer questions and circumvent our panelist policy may result in a ban.\n* Posts and comments which flagrantly violate the rules, especially in a trolling manner, will be removed and treated as shitposts, and may result in a ban.\n* No reposts of a question that you have already asked within the last year.\n* No posts or comments of AI-created or AI-assisted text or audio. Panelists may not user any form of AI-assistance in writing or researching answers.\n* Harassing individual moderators or the moderator team will result in a permanent ban and a report to the reddit admins.\n\n___________________________________\n\n#Frequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow are some frequently asked questions. If you have other questions, please [contact the moderators via modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) (not via private message or chat).\n\n###My post or comment was removed. How can I get an explanation?\nAlmost all posts/comments which are removed will receive an explanation of their removal. That explanation will generally by /r/askphilosophy's custom bot, /u/BernardJOrtcutt, and will list the removal reason. Posts which are removed will be notified via a stickied comment; comments which are removed will be notified via a reply. If your post or comment resulted in a ban, the message will be included in the ban message via modmail. If you have further questions, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy).\n\n###How can I appeal my post or comment removal?\nTo appeal a removal, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) (not via private message or chat). Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible. Reposting removed posts/comments without receiving mod approval will result in a permanent ban.\n\n###How can I appeal my ban?\nTo appeal a ban, please respond to the modmail informing you of your ban. Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible.\n\n###My comment was removed or I was banned for arguing with someone else, but they started it. Why was I punished and not them?\nSomeone else breaking the rules does not give you permission to break the rules as well. /r/askphilosophy does not comment on actions taken on other accounts, but all violations are treated as equitably as possible. \n\n###I found a post or comment which breaks the rules, but which wasn't removed. How can I help?\nIf you see a post or comment which you believe breaks the rules, please report it using the report function for the appropriate rule. /r/askphilosophy's moderators are volunteers, and it is impossible for us to manually review every comment on every thread. We appreciate your help in reporting posts/comments which break the rules.\n\n###My post isn't showing up, but I didn't receive a removal notification. What happened?\nSometimes the AutoMod filter will automatically send posts to a filter for moderator approval, especially from accounts which are new or haven't posted to /r/askphilosophy before. If your post has not been approved or removed within 24 hours, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy).\n\n###My post was removed and referred to the Open Discussion Thread. What does this mean?\nThe Open Discussion Thread (ODT) is /r/askphilosophy's place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but do not necessarily meet our posting rules (especially PR2/PR5). For example, these threads are great places for:\n\n* Discussions of a philosophical issue, rather than questions\n* Questions about commenters' personal opinions regarding philosophical issues\n* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. \"who is your favorite philosopher?\"\n* Questions about philosophy as an academic discipline or profession, e.g. majoring in philosophy, career options with philosophy degrees, pursuing graduate school in philosophy\n\nIf your post was removed and referred to the ODT we encourage you to consider posting it to the ODT to share with others.\n\n###My comment responding to someone else was removed, as well as their comment. What happened?\nWhen /r/askphilosophy removes a parent comment, we also often remove all their child comments in order to help readability and focus on discussion.\n\n###I'm interested in philosophy. Where should I start? What should I read?\nAs explained above, philosophy is a very broad discipline and thus offering concise advice on where to start is very hard. We recommend reading [this /r/AskPhilosophyFAQ post](https://reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4ifqi3/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start/) which has a great breakdown of various places to start. For further or more specific questions, we recommend posting on /r/askphilosophy.\n\n###Why is your understanding of philosophy so limited?\nAs explained above, this subreddit is devoted to philosophy as understood and done by philosophers. In order to prevent this subreddit from becoming /r/atheism2, /r/politics2, or /r/science2, we must uphold a strict topicality requirement in PR1. Posts which may touch on philosophical themes but are not distinctively philosophical can be posted to one of reddit's many other subreddits.\n\n###Are there other philosophy subreddits I can check out?\nIf you are interested in other philosophy subreddits, please see [this list of related subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/sublinks). /r/askphilosophy shares much of its modteam with its sister-subreddit, /r/philosophy, which is devoted to philosophical discussion. In addition, that list includes more specialized subreddits and more casual subreddits for those looking for a less-regulated forum.\n\n###A thread I wanted to comment in was locked but is still visible. What happened?\nWhen a post becomes unreasonable to moderate due to the amount of rule-breaking comments the thread is locked. /r/askphilosophy's moderators are volunteers, and we cannot spend hours cleaning up individual threads.\n\n###Do you have a list of frequently asked questions about philosophy that I can browse?\n\nYes! We have an FAQ that answers many questions comprehensively: /r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/. For example, [this entry](https://reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i8php/is_morality_objective_or_subjective_does/) provides an introductory breakdown to the debate over whether morality is objective or subjective.\n\n###Do you have advice or resources for graduate school applications?\n\nWe [made a meta-guide for PhD applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/gradschoolapps) with the goal of assembling the important resources for grad school applications in one place. We aim to occasionally update it, but can of course not guarantee the accuracy and up-to-dateness. You are, of course, kindly invited to ask questions about graduate school on /r/askphilosophy, too, especially in the Open Discussion Thread.\n\n###Do you have samples of what counts as good questions and answers?\n\nSure! We ran a *Best of 2020* Contest, you can find the winners [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l6zd6n/best_of_2020_final_results_and_celebration_thread/)!",

        "content": "As far as I know, the majority of philosophers have abandoned the logical Problem of Evil in favor of the evidential one. This is because you can just respond to the logical problem by saying that God has reasons to allow evil in order to allow greater good that outweighs the evil. But is this really convincing? If God is omnipotent, then he can get the \"greater\" good without the evil. I often hear apologists argue that God is obviously omnipotent, but he can't do illogical things (like create a rock he can't lift), but in this case how would getting this greater good without evil be illogical? It's weird to me that such an exceptional argument would fall out of fashion for a seemingly non-issue.",

            "As long as there is any possible way for a universe created by an all good, all knowing, and all powerful being to contain evil, the logical argument fails.\n\nShowing that there is no possible way is a pretty big job. It makes more sense to use move to the inductive version.",
            "As others have answered, the main reason is that theists have to clear a very low bar to respond to the logical problem of evil. All they have to do is tell some *possible* story about how God and evil could coexist. The evidential variants of the problem place a much higher burden on the theist: they have to explain why God would need *this much*  and *this kind* of evil to get whatever greater good.\n\nThat's not to say no one finds the logical problem of evil convincing. I'm sure plenty of atheist philosophers do. But it's dialectically weak.",
            "> This is because you can just respond to the logical problem by saying that God has reasons to allow evil in order to allow greater good that outweighs the evil.\n\nThis is most certainly not the only way to approach this issue. Particularly among Platonic thought and its reception, the existence of evil is denied altogether - evil is defined as an absence of goodness, lacking any substance in itself. The Gods, for a Platonic author like Sallustius, did not 'create' evil, because a nonbeing can, by definition, not be created.",
            "I think it's important to understand that the LPoE, and rebuttals to it, are highly technical works of logic.  If we reduce them to intuitive summaries, and then fail to see what's wrong with the summaries, we haven't really touched on the arguments themselves, any more than we do useful work in quantum theory by making popular arguments about quantum this-and-that.\n\nThe full version of the LPoE, and its defeat, are primarily to be found in an exchange of papers between J. L. Mackie and Alvin Plantinga, over the course of the 1950s-1970s.  The goal of Mackie's LPoE is to provide a _logical proof_ of God's non-existence - not merely a strong intuitive case, or anything like that.  As such, this argument is subject to the usual rules of classical logic, including that a single counterexample establishes the falsity of a principle.  If I say \"all dogs are four-legged\" and someone shows a three-legged dog, then it is not _logically_ the case that all dogs are four-legged, even if almost all of them are.\n\nWhat Plantinga accomplished was to find a single, convoluted, unlikely counterexample.  It's very important to grasp the point here that Plantinga did not propose this as _true_, or even likely.  Plantinga's counterexample involves legions of free-will-possessing demons causing evils which appear natural to us.  That doesn't mean Plantinga thinks there _are_ such demons, any more than a chess player moving a queen to the second rank has any implications about their views on feminism.  Plantinga and Mackie were engaged in a specific kind of technical discourse, and it is only within this context that Plantinga's responses make any sense at all.\n\nExperts in the field, who understand the rules of the game Mackie and Plantinga were playing, have overwhelmingly judged that Plantinga won.  There _is_ a counterexample to the LPoE as formulated by Mackie, and so the argument fails _as a logical argument_.  The atheist side is forced to retreat, and the new position they are forced to take up is that _on the preponderance of evidence_ there is no God, known as the evidential problem of evil.  The EPoE remains a live issue today.\n\nSo the LPoE didn't \"fall out of fashion.\"  It was conclusively defeated.  If this defeat hinges on what seems to be an easily ignored non-issue, this is just typical of formal logical arguments.  In my field, computer science, we are almost completely certain that the complexity class NP is larger than the class P.  We would really like to have a proof of this; in fact, whoever comes up with a proof will win a prize that comes with a million-dollar award.  Our lack of a proof hinges on obscure and seemingly-unimportant minutia; if we were willing to gloss over these matters even a little bit, we could say with great certainty that P != NP.  But we can't, because of the rules of logic don't allow it.  And we can't call something a _proof_ unless it adheres to these very specific and technical rules.",
            "Let's assume that free will is valuable, that's what the Free Will Defence by Plantinga, which is generally taken to be the decisive blow to the Logical Problem of Evil, relies on. God wants human beings to have free will because that makes the world better.  \nNow it is obviously incoherent to \\*make\\* someone choose The Good freely - being forced to do something freely is as nonsensical as a square circle. God cannot do that which is logically incoherent!  \nBut maybe God could arrange the universe such that, through a deterministic process, they will rationally decide, on their own, to choose The Good - but then, of of course, the vast majority of Christian philosophers reject Compatibilism... so to appeal to Compatibilism to put forward the Logical Problem of Evil would be obviously question-begging.",

            "Lost to time? More like lost to disease, enslavement, and colonization. Native American sciences shouldn\u2019t be compared to the Western scientific method. People from both Western and Indigenous communities have critiqued scientism and the dominance of Western science on the global and modern mind. That being said, the two models are fundamentally different. Attempting to reconstruct the scientific model of Native Americans in the United States, for example, can be seen as a form of violence. Native Americans generally do not hold the Western scientific method in high esteem.\n\nYou should read up on the fight surrounding the discovery of Kennewick Man, a 9,000 year old Native American found buried on an army base of I\u2019m not mistaken. U.S. scientists took several tribes to court for almost a decade over the remains, arguing that his body belonged to the U.S. government. Early scientific testing claimed he wasn\u2019t related to the local tribes\u2014Umatilla, Yakama, and others\u2014who asserted that the remains were those of an ancestor, given that he was found on what had been their ancestral lands. In 2015, DNA evidence conclusively proved that Kennewick Man was indeed a genetic ancestor of these tribes, leading to his reburial by the tribes. Any comparison between these scientific models is, at best, contentious.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for intellectuals or philosophers who critique or investigate Native American scientific models and western scientific models you should read Vine Deloria Jr\u2019s \u201cThe Metaphysics of Modern Existence\u201d. It touches upon science and metaphysics Indian and western. James Maffie has a book on Aztec Metaphysics and he critiques European philosophy and science also in the intro of his book \u201cAztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion\u201d.",
            "Comparing two epistemologies is not violence\u2026 thats absurd.",
            "Could you explain why you think the act of comparing is violent? My background is in anthropology, and my (past) work is very much related to this.",
            "I didn\u2019t say it was violent. I said it could be seen as violence. If it\u2019s not violent it could definitely be racist as has been in the past and racism and violence in the US go hand in hand through history. Thoughts?",

            "I didn\u2019t say it was violent. I said it can be seen as violent. Consider Native Americans who have suffered at the hands of the US government would be exaggerating the sense of discomfort they feel at having their epistemologies compared to western ones and then having people say that there\u2019s are inferior or irrational as has been the case in the past? Well, if it\u2019s not violent then it could be seen as racist to compare them at the very least. Making value judgments about cultural epistemologies can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce systemic racism. And racism tends to have a violent hand in the United States. If racism isn\u2019t violence what is it? Who would be willing to claim racism is harmless?",

It also does not necessarily involve any form of value judgment as well.\n\nYour concern is a major topic in the Ontological Turn in anthropology. Viveiros de Castro and Martin Holbraad are two big names in this subfield.",
            "I didn't say it was *necessarily* racist or stereotypical. I said that it was *possible* and I say that it is *possible* for the comparison between western and Native American epistemologies and metaphysics to fall into racist proclamations against Native American philosophy because it has happened before in the past and can therefore happen again in the future. That's perfectly reasonable.\n\nI didn't say it has to involve making value judgments, I gave the example of when this comparing falls into making value judgments that the door opens more easily to racist statements. My definition of racism is one in which a certain group of people are dehumanized as Kant, Hume, Hegel and Locke all did at one time or another by dehumanizing Native Americans.\n\nSure, you can compare Aztec philosophy with Continental philosophy on a point by point basis. Compare them in evaluative terms and you run a risk of dehumanizing a culture or society for their way of thinking."
