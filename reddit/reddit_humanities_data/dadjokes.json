They have helped raise money to improve kids lives by creating better education, healthcare and economic opportunities around the world. In 2022, Save the Children helped 118 million children in 116 countries.\n\n**How to contribute**  \nEvery purchase of [dad joke merch](https://dadserious.co/) from [Dad Serious](https://dadserious.co/) will donate a portion to Save the Children during this season. Fresh dumb dad joke designs on the regular. Redditors can get 15% off with this code: DADJOKESMARCH\n\nOr you can donate directly to your region\u2019s [Save The Children](https://www.savethechildren.org/) and send me a DM to verify for our total.\n\nWhether you like to keep your donation pure or get something fun for your money and know it's also doing good, you're a legend either way.\n\n**Quick update on our last season**  \nHere is [our donation](https://imgur.com/a/NV1hQCv) to Make-A-Wish Thank you to everyone who got involved.\n\n**We\u2019ve now raised a total of $371 for charity!**  \nNot bad for early days - every little bit counts - can\u2019t wait to see what we can do over the year.\n\n*This is still a bit of an experiment to see how we can build something that turns bad jokes into good outcomes. If you have any thoughts, or you'd like to recommend a charity, feel free to DM or comment.*",
