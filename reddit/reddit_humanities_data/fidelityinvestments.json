I'm happy to add to the brilliance! \n\nWhile ETFs and Mutual Funds can be similar in some ways, they have distinct differences, including their trading characteristics, pricing factors, and tax implications. For instance, a notable difference is that mutual funds trade only once per day while ETFs trade throughout the day, similar to a stock.\n\nCheck out the article below for more on the differences between mutual funds and ETFS:\n\n[Mutual Funds vs. ETFs: Which is Right for You?](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/mutual-fund-or-etf) \n\nHere's a follow-up article as well about the taxability of mutual funds: \n\n[Mutual Funds - Tax Topics](https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/mutual-funds) \n\nIf you'd like suggestions on specific positions/strategies and what to purchase, I would encourage you to use our daily discussion thread, which we pin at the top of the subreddit. I appreciate you posting another question on the sub, and we look forward, as always, to growing your internal brilliance!",
            "Mutual funds came first and allow dollar amount investing. Before fractional share purchases became a thing you could only buy ETFs by number of shares. So if you have $7,000 in your Roth IRA and wanted to invest in IVV (S&P 500 ETF)  which is $546.97 (for example purposes only) per share you could only invest $6.563.64, the other 436.36 would remain uninvested in your Roth IRA. With a index mutual fund like FXAIX (S&P 500) the entire $7,000 can be invested.\n\nAlso in a Roth/Traditional IRA you do not have to worry about capital gains because they are tax advantage accounts.\n\nI have FXAIX and IVV in my Roth. I started with FXAIX and switched to IVV because I like being able to see the price change during market hours. Purely a personal choice.",
            "I follow a low cost index fund model as the majority of my Roth IRA portfolio.\n\nTo get good diversification, I have a large, mid and small cap fund, plus an International fund as like 85-90%, so:\n\nFXAIX (S&P 500) - Large cap\n\nFSMDX - Mid cap\n\nFSSNX - Small cap\n\nFSPSX - International\n\n  \nI also hold a bit of the semiconductor fund in FSELX, and a few individual stocks that I like owning.

Fees may be \u201cso little\u201d $$ now, but when you look at 40 years of paying it - it adds up a lot.\n\nFNILX has only been around for 5 years, but you can see it made more than FXAIX, and I think it is due to fees.

People often treat their \"retirement account\" as if it needs to be invested conservatively. As money is fungible, I find that suboptimal. When I hit 10x trades, I want them to be in my tax-free accounts. The boring dividend earners are in my taxed account.\n\nI'm not a huge options trader, but options traders should prefer those trades in tax advantaged accounts as well over buy and hold equity.",
            "Mutual funds came first and their growth was highly correlated with the introduction and subsequent widespread adoption of 401k plans. Mutual funds trade on a daily basis so when you deduct money from paychecks and deposit it for multiple individuals at the same time mutual funds fit the bill. Mutual funds that have low fees like under .30% or .0x% can be good choices as long as the holdings fit your portfolio goals.\n\nMutual funds with >.5% still exist because they make a lot of money financial advisors etc. make money by getting their clients in them. And sometimes paid a commission to sell people certain funds. A lot of people don\u2019t know anything about ETFs or investing and just hand over x dollars to their financial advisors and never think about it again. And they are often taken advantage of \n\nVOO/SPY/VTI/FXIAX/FZROC  etc (any S and P 500 or US total market fund ) are all basically the same you only need one . The latter (Total US market funds) also just has smaller companies inside of it too thats the only difference. I would look into having an international fund like FZILX I have a soft spot for VIOV. I would consider combining the blue chip into your total US fund . 2-4 funds are plenty"

I agree with both of you in that the new report format is just awful.  It's not a \"Retirement Analysis\"... at best, it's a 1-page summary.\n\nFor those readers who don't know, the old Retirement Analysis Report was 33 pages of charts, graphs and other data, plus 8 pages of fine print.  The 33 pages broke information into 3 scenarios: significantly below market conditions, below market conditions, and average market conditions. One of the most important charts was the Detailed Income Analysis, which has a line-by-line breakdown (for each year from retirement until death) showing expenses, income, and withdrawals. This data is the core of any retirement planning / forecasting tool.  And now that is gone. \n\nAt the bottom of the 1-page summary, there is a box titled \"Your Plan Snapshot\", and this box contains a link to \"Your Previous Plans\".  Which takes you to a list of every Retirement Analysis Report you saved on the Fidelity site (I save and also download a pdf for my files).
