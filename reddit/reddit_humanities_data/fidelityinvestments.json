            "Reddit is just yield chasing. Because they don't need to worry about tax and wash sale, and many other limitation that any investor need to worry about.\n\nIn the last 5 years, it's kind of always true that people can just buy a stock who recently just went up significantly, because it will continue for many many times. And sell when it has a major drop. Keep switching stocks as if no tax is involved.",

            "Congrats on outpacing the S&P 500 this quarter!  Just as a note, the dip before this update was due to the NVDA split not being reflected correctly.  That has been corrected and reflected correctly in this chart.\n\nBe on the lookout for a post on Monday to start Q3s picking as well as to claim a trophy in your user flair.\n\nHave a good weekend all :)\n\n\\*edit fixed spelling",

It's easy to miss updates on Reddit or in the current Discord channel since it's a general discussion channel"
