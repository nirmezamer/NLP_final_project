I feel very ugly without it because I know I could look so much better with it. Is there anyway to enhance my natural appearance so I don\u2019t have to wear makeup all the time? The first 3 pictures are with makeup and the rest are without. I don\u2019t take many pictures without makeup often at all so they are kind of old pics.",

            "You should never be insecure without makeup natural beauty is fantastic you're a beautiful woman and I'm sure that most guys like natural a lot better than kicked on makeup I remember the 80s I didn't like make up then I think you're beautiful just the way you are please don't ruin it with makeup. Thank you for sharing with us I'm sorry about your in security you shouldn't have any at all.",
            "You\u2019re naturally beautiful.  Many guys myself included are not a fan of caked on makeup. You don\u2019t need make up at all.  You don\u2019t need to be insecure. What the hell is social media doing to people?!?!",
            "I am shocked that you doubt your looks. You are delusional and I recommend you try to accept that and break free of your delusions. Best thing you can start doing to loon better is accept what you are. Consider the fact that the way people look is far less important than the way people act and think",
            "You have beautiful skin, eyes, everything!!!  Unless you want to wear makeup, it\u2019s really unnecessary!  You\u2019re lovely!",
            "You look great both ways honestly",
            "Caught a glimpse of your photos (without reading post) and my first thought was what's wrong with these photos/already wearing makeup. The last 3 photos look no different than the first 3. That's a compliment.",
            "Are you kidding? I thought this was a troll post at first. You are BEAUTIFUL. I\u2019m not a girl who gives out compliments very much, but I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re insecure. I couldn\u2019t even tell which picture had no makeup. Body dysmorphia is a beast and it\u2019s LYING TO YOU. I would trade places with you in a heartbeat.",
            "Ehh I have the same problem. I feel like I look a lot better with my lashes curled so maybe a lash perm. Brown & lash tint if you're naturally blond.",
            "God id love to see you lean into the 1950s aesthetic some more. \nGranted, it wasn't a makeup free era but it was dominated by pastel colours and red lipstick. \nYour face is beautiful so I think it would be a really strong look for you."

            "A middle part or a less deep side part would suit you a little better. I think also adding some brow shaping or filling, with a some mascara on curled lashes would brighten up your eye area. The only thing I think that ages you, is your accessories seem a little more of a mature style, but if that is your taste I say rock it!",
