            "You look zero percent masculine",
            "Just be comfortable in yourself, you know who you are so why care about other people perceptions of you",
            "You don't look masculine but even if you do, it's not a bad thing because masculine features in women give a striking appearance that modeling agencies love. However if you think that you do look masculine, probably wear makeup that can make your face look more feminine according to your liking. I don't think you'd need makeup to look less masculine because you don't look masculine at all but if you think that way, feminine makeup would suit you well along with proper skincare and styling.",
            "Dont see it, do you really have a penis? Or is this more of a how to look less rugged kinda post?",
            "You are pretty, rhino and maybe a lip flip if you want to look for surgeries but its really unnecessary. DEFINETLEY get some brown mascara, I have dark brown hair and it makes my makeup look so much more natural. Black lashes and the extensions just look so harsh, try brown mascara. I felt the same way you do (cosplaying as a woman) when I had acne, you dont have close to the amount of skin issues I used to have but your skin may the issue. Since you can afford/ are thinking about plastic surgery (again its totally unnecessary for you) go to a derm, saved my life.",
            "You dont look masculine but instead of black lashes you should try and color match with ur brows or hair so like ya and u should try to thin ur brows out a little to see if u like it but But ur cute",

            "Stop doing the side part. It makes your face look uneven. You cant really fix your downturned eyes unless you get surgery, but you can use makeup to elongate or make then appear slanted. Maybe fill in your eyebrows some more as well.",
