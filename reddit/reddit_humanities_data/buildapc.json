            "Back already with another Asus X99-WS question. I have an E5-2650L V4 CPU that I got for a different project that didn't pan out. Depending on how much CPU load this system is going to see, would that be acceptable, or would it be painfully slow for pretty much everything? It's going to be a workstation with multiple GPUs, but I'm not really sure how much it's going to need CPU power.\n\nThese are the CPUs I was considering as top-of-the-line options for this system: [Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz vs Intel Xeon E5-1680 v4 @ 3.40GHz vs Intel Core i7-6950X @ 3.00GHz vs Intel Xeon E5-2687W v4 @ 3.00GHz vs Intel Xeon E5-2650L v4 @ 1.70GHz \\[cpubenchmark.net\\] by PassMark Software](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/2753vs2869vs2792vs2765vs3054/Intel-Xeon-E5-2699-v4-vs-Intel-Xeon-E5-1680-v4-vs-Intel-i7-6950X-vs-Intel-Xeon-E5-2687W-v4-vs-Intel-Xeon-E5-2650L-v4)",
            "Are AiOs prone to fans humming due to turbulance? Or is it due to the small space in my SFF enclosure? (NR200P Max.)\n\nI've changed 3 brands of fans, tried each with and without grilles, tried bumping up the minimum rpm to over 55% (because the humming is most noticeable at around 50%) but it comes back all the time.\n\nNever had this problem in my Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact, using air coolers, and with a tempered class side panel and the whole chassis stashed away under my desk, which obviously helps a ton versus an SFF with holes everywhere sitting within arm's reach.\n\nSo is the humming something that happens easily with AiOs? Or something that is more related to a smaller space in SFF enclosures?\n\nI've tried to get used to it over the last couple months and I just can't take it anymore. It's driving me crazy lol\n\nI'm looking at replacing the NR200P Max with something like Fractal Design North, Lian Li A3-mATX, Fractal Design Mood/Era 2 etc, but I don't want that hum to come back so I need to first know whether I should be avoiding AiOs or avoiding SFF enclosures :(",

            "Hello, please help. I'm getting my boyfriend a keyboard for his birthday so he can build his pc, but I don't know whether to get MX Red or MX Silent Red. He is a gamer and uses it exclusively for gaming. I can't ask him because it's a surprise. Please help, which one is best for gaming???",

            "Is Kingston SSD NVMe M.2 2280 500GB Kingston 3D NAND (SNV2S/1000G) reliable choice for Windows? How is it when compared to MSI M390 Spatium?",
            "It's an alright server CPU, but it will be painfully bad for games and will limit more powerful GPU systems.\n\nThis platform is subpar for modern RAM-heavy tasks (we've gone a long way from 2400 MHz DDR4 to 5600 MHz DDR5 in GPU systems) and has limited PCIe lanes: some high-end compute GPUs (PCIe 4.0/5.0 x16) will suffer at PCIe 3.0 x8.",
            "Fans might \"hum\" if case parts aren't matched perfectly and have room to vibrate.\n\nIf hum disappears when you put your hand on some part of the case, you can remove the problematic panel and pad its edges with electrical or anti-squeak tape."

Most importantly is that I want to be able to page up and page down through the documents as fast as I can hit the down arrow and page down keys; with the most minimal delay possible.  Is my money best spent on the fastest processor (i9 or higher), or a less powerful processor with 128 GB or 256 GB (or more) of memory, or a gamer's level GPU?  What do you think?  ",

            "Not GPU. Frankly an iGPU would be fine on any current CPU.\n\nI\u2019d wager single core CPU clock speed and memory speed/latency are most important.\n\nSSD will only affect the time it takes each to open. After that it\u2019s in memory.",
            "Rgb",
            "For going through simple PDFS and scrolling through them? \nYour cpu will matter the most but i would recommend getting an nvme ssd at the minimum. that's going to be part of the read/write data with the CPU to open the files seamlessly and flick through them.  64 gb of ram should be plenty, you could go 128gb max if you're going to be storing a lot of large sized pdfs. Your gpu shouldn't be too much of a concern because text going up and down your screen isn't going to be used by your gpu. This does not mean to skimp out on my a gpu. \n\njust another perspective as someone who deals with ppl not being able to open and go through there pdfs fast enough for 80% of there job.",

            "I think any modern mini-pc with a current CPU, SSD, and a decent - 16 or 32 GB - amount of RAM will do nicely.  Are you having some issues with an old system for this application and if so what is it?",
            "I don\u2019t think anyone could confidently tell you unless they\u2019ve done this specific workflow themselves, so you may need to monitor hardware usage and adapt after building. That said I think below is a good guess.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a powerful GPU, and integrated graphics chip is definitely fine. \n\nYou probably won\u2019t need a crazy CPU, and the CPU market is in a healthy state atm so you can get a good deal.\n\nIMO RAM is going to be the most important factor. You won\u2019t need super fast RAM, just lots of it. \n\nWhat id build:\n\n- i5 or i7 from 13th or 14th gen Intel (budget permitting).\n\n- 128gbs of ddr4 ram (it\u2019s dirt cheap)\n\n- 4tb SSD or nvme (this is budget dependent, but at least boot the system off an SSD and then use HDDs if you need to).\n\nAlso definitely explore 2 or more monitors as an option. And check hardware monitor when you\u2019re deep in your workflow. You\u2019ll be able to see if there\u2019s any bottlenecks.",
            "Your user case sounds more like a RAM related task.\n\nYou also going to need the correct PDF reader for this. Some will be faster than others.",
            "Might depend on your choice of PDF viewer. Acrobat is single threaded and more cores doesn\u2019t help. A multithreaded viewer would optimize on a different CPU.",
            "I posted a reply with a build, then re-read your use case and realized I was off a bit. I am assuming that the PDF's you are viewing were not digitized with OCR, and are images of text, not text itself. This means those are some VERY large files. \n\nI would recommend 4+ core CPU, but they don't need to be particularly powerful cores.  What you will want to focus the most on is RAM. This is one of the very few use cases I recommend getting a motherboard with 4 RAM slots, but only using two, leaving yourself room to upgrade. RAM speed doesn't matter, so you will even be fine not enabling XMP. This means that you will have significantly fewer problems with upgrading RAM later if needed. You can get the system with 2 sticks, see how it runs and how much memory it uses at full, and then get 2 more if the RAM is still being a problem. \n\nGPU is almost insignificant, except that I would not go for an IGPU just so that you are not sharing RAM with it. \n\nWhile I do not usually pontificate on OS's, this is one use case that you might seriously consider using Linux instead of Windows. Not only might this save your budget a little (depending on if you were planning to activate Windows or not) but you will probably get snappier performance from most Linux Distros for this than you will from Windows.\n\nMy first suggestion for a system would be something that looks something like this. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dxQVN6 (You can get by with a less powerful GPU by far, but I selected one that should still be supported for a while.) \n\nBut if possible you should get some more information before you purchase. Do you already have a computer and at least some of the PDF's? If so, look at the PDF Files and let us know the file size of the files. Then reboot your computer (so that there is nothing lingering in memory) and load just one of the PDF,s then check your memory usage and write it down. Then Load a second, write down your memory usage. Then load two more and write down your memory usage with 4 loaded at once. With this information, we can do a MUCH better job at giving you an accurate answer of what system you will want to use. \n\nAlso, what is your budget for this, and how mission critical is it? In my link above I was assuming you wanted to save as much money as possible, but if you are instead wanting to spend $2000 and want it to work as well as possible, with fractional seconds making a real difference, I would go for a very different build."

A \"loud\"' popping noise is a large capacitor blowing, either the power supply, motherboard, or GPU.\u00a0\n\n\nA good sniff for the smell of burning metal will tell you which of the three it is.\u00a0\n\n\nUltimately this is the danger of selling valuables to a friend. One of you has to take the loss.\n\n\nIf you're lucky, he was exaggerating the sound, and a power cable is just loose.",

            "I agree with the others that the power supply is likely fried. The question is why did it fry at that time? As it was working when he first turned it on, I would check and see where he has it plugged in. Is there anything on the same circuit that draws a lot of current or switches on or off like a fridge or air conditioning unit? They can introduce surges into power when the compressors turn on and off. If nothing like that is plugged into the same circuit, it may be just pure coincidence that the power supply suddenly failed at that time.  Often a surge in power is why a working power supply suddenly fails.",

            "Check if he connected it to a cheap power strip overloaded with other devices. \n\nCheck and reset the power supply switch and replace the fuse if necessary.\n\nLook at the PC internal components to see if anything is blackened from a spark. \n\nIf I were you, I'd offer to replace a dead PSU, but not if it's due to a faulty power source at his house."
