            "Does an mATX motherboard like the Asus Prime B550m-a fit inside a Micro-ATX case like the Antec CX200M Elite or the Deepcool MACUBE 110? This is a work desktop so I'm not fussed about cooling, just trying to reduce size and figured I might as well take the opportunity to try building in a Micro-ATX case for the first time.",
            "Depends on which games. Esports games can easily hit 180 Hz, especially on low settings.",
            "It isn't significantly more expensive than lower high refresh rate monitors like 160hz so should be worth it.  \nAnd as long as it has VRR and LFC, you won't suffer anything from \"excess refresh rate\".",
            "Putting in the slower RAM would force your current RAM to run at 2400MHz as well, which will reduce performance, especially with Ryzen CPUs. Best to use that RAM somewhere else and buy a matching 3600MHz CL16 kit if you're currently running out of RAM.",
            "It seems likely to me that you don't have enough independent 6+2 pin connectors for what you're trying to run on the PSU. Also connecting the iCue system hub into your GPU isn't something that strikes me as a good idea. My rough understanding is that the nature of the 6+2 cables means they draw enough power to fuel everything connected to them, and it all goes equally to everything. Your system hub obviously requires less power than a 4080, so the thing shuts down to protect itself/not be a fire hazard. Due to not drawing any power, your GPU no no longer gets enough. Unplug the system hub and see what happens.\n\nYou probably just need to upgrade your PSU to something with more 6+2 pin connectors or straight up 8 pin connectors. Also personally I would go for 1,000 watts for a 4080 build depending on your CPU and RAM.",
            "mATX is micro-ATX, so yes, those cases would fit an mATX or ITX motherboard.",
            "Hey all, my friend recently passed me 2x4gb DDR4 2400Mhz CL 16-16-16-39 1.20V ver3.20 RAM (CMK4GX4M1A2400C16 Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM).\n\nThing is, I already have Trident Z Neo's 2x8gb DDR4 3600Mhz CL 16-19-19-39 1.35v (F4-3600C16D-16GTZNC).\n\nSo my question is, would the pc play well/ any improvement combining these 2 mismatched sets, or perhaps a site where I sort of compare the improvements/ performance hits? I could still use the 2x4gb in some other build, no issues",
            "Bad GPU or not enough power?\n\nI have a Maingear Ignition 850w PSU. I just upgraded to the PNY 4080 Super from the Asus 3070. \n\nThe PSU has x2 Y style 6+2 connectors, so basically 4 total 6+2 connectors via 2 headers into PSU. x3 of these 6+2 connectors go into the 3to1 Nvidia pcie 5 connector, and the 4th 6+2 (shares a cable with the gpu) connects to my Corsair iCue system hub for my h170i. \n\nExperiencing random system hangups, choppiness, screen goes black for a few seconds then back to Windows, usually have to force shut down. Issue occurs when I'm doing basic Windows desktop tasks. Reliability history shows errors livekernelevents that seem to be associated with graphics card. Tried various drivers, clean uninstalls even a Windows reformat as well as a new m.2 drive. Everything works fine with my 3070.\n\nI'm hoping I'm just an idiot for trying to power this card on my current PSU and hope to not have to return my 4080. Though I've also been told that 850w is more than enough, so not sure. What do you think?",
            "Alright thx. Though my understanding is even between two 2x8gb ram from the same manufacturer/ cl speed, no guarantees that they'd play well with each other right? Sot it might be better to simply get a set of dual channel ram of your speed/ capacity of your choice?"

I'm trying to plant out a build like this using the guidelines., However, the case I like, that's on the sff copmpatible cases guideline, is the Fractal Design Era 2, which doesn't have specs listed anywhere I can find, and isn't listed on PCPP.
