            "While technically part of a filler arc, episode 342 adapts the final moments of (manga spoilers for newbies) >!Ichigo losing his shinigami powers and his farewell to Rukia!<, it's a beautiful episode that shouldn't be skipped just because it's \"filler\", moreover the episode itself only has a small mention/flashback of said filler arc, nothing dealbreaker.",

            "Episode 342 is a must watch. The mistake of most lists is to call it filler, which causes newbies to skip it",

Compromises were made to allow Uraharabot to remain active after it was brought online in a similar fashion. \n\nAllowing additional character bots outside our direct control isn't something we're prepared to do right now, and allowing Aizen would immediately prompt more bots to be made for other characters. I've already removed 1 post about who should be the next bot character. We don't want another situation like we had with Uraharabot where it spontaneously became really toxic. I don't even remember what it did, but it woke up one day and decided to be gross. Having multiple bots decide to embrace the worst parts of the internet at once would be highly entertaining but also a nightmare to moderate. \n\nUraharabot is already divisive and I personally don't want to open the floodgates to make this place like prequelmemes or something similar without the majority of the community getting a chance to voice their opinions.  So what do you Chad enthusiasts think? \n\nThis post has been sponsored by the Urahara Shoten\n\n",

            "If we do get an aizen bot, I don't think it should respond to every instance of the word \"aizen\". That would be way too hectic and would impede real conversations. I've observed the urahara bot we have currently, it only responds occasionally to the word \"urahara\" but responds every time to \"uraharabot\" etc. \n\nAlso, I think the urahara bot can automatically ban users if their requests are too vulgar lmao.  If new bots are added they should similar guardrails",
            "This post is brought to you by Ichibei and sponsored by Urahara, these bad people want to prevent Aizen from overthrowing their status quo and asserting new authority over Bleach society smh.",
            "I think you removed my post abt the next bot but I kinda agree with you or Uraharabot has turned evil as I thought and has taken over your mind to get you to remove Aizenbot",
            "Wait, you mean to tell me that Uraharabot got drunk one night and decided to be toxic?\n\nKisuke, how could you?",
            "I always thought it was funny that the way they stop aizen is they wrap him up in a giant 3 pronged doobie",
            "Uraharabot was just off on the Ambien that day, give him a break",
            "AizenBot should only respond with short impending responses. Such as \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that\u2026\u201d It should in no way be elaborate like UraharaBot who in character loves to explain everything that happens. Whereas Aizen is a mystery, he should remain a mystery.",
            "The bots are dumb. Ban 'em all and let the hell arc sort them out.",
            "I agree that we're opening the floodgate and should not allow any more to be made/active. It will make this sub not great very quickly.\n\nI just commented the below statement to another post asking \"What should be the next bot?\"\n\n\"While fun, I think the addition of more bots would start making this sub feel quite unnatural/annoying to participate in. If you want to interact with Chat GTP on your own time and post the interaction, that's one thing, but a bot appearing when a name is mentioned can/will get out of hand if we keep adding them. \n\nThis isn't to diss either bot (well our new one has yet to prove as funny imo) or the entertainment they can add, but in a forum setting where we want real opinions of people who also enjoy a series, it's a fad/meme/joke that will play out way too much and quickly.\n\n2 is enough, especially when those two are some of the most influential characters in the series as a whole.\""
