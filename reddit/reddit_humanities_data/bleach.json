Compromises were made to allow Uraharabot to remain active after it was brought online in a similar fashion. \n\nAllowing additional character bots outside our direct control isn't something we're prepared to do right now, and allowing Aizen would immediately prompt more bots to be made for other characters. I've already removed 1 post about who should be the next bot character. We don't want another situation like we had with Uraharabot where it spontaneously became really toxic. I don't even remember what it did, but it woke up one day and decided to be gross. Having multiple bots decide to embrace the worst parts of the internet at once would be highly entertaining but also a nightmare to moderate. \n\nUraharabot is already divisive and I personally don't want to open the floodgates to make this place like prequelmemes or something similar without the majority of the community getting a chance to voice their opinions.  So what do you Chad enthusiasts think? \n\nThis post has been sponsored by the Urahara Shoten\n\n",

            "If we do get an aizen bot, I don't think it should respond to every instance of the word \"aizen\". That would be way too hectic and would impede real conversations. I've observed the urahara bot we have currently, it only responds occasionally to the word \"urahara\" but responds every time to \"uraharabot\" etc. \n\nAlso, I think the urahara bot can automatically ban users if their requests are too vulgar lmao.  If new bots are added they should similar guardrails",

This moment is profound because it reveals his inner strength and self acceptance.
