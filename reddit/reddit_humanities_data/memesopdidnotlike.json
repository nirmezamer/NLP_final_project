        "content": "First off, apologies for delaying the outcome of the recent poll (https://www.reddit.com/r/memesopdidnotlike/s/DbbahUEg70).  After much deliberation, our mod team has decided using the data gathered from the poll to restrict political posts to the weekends, like BoysAreQuirky posts.  This is a trial ban on political posts, and we may adjust the policy in the coming weeks. The action taken is the limitation of these kind of submissions since more people chose some form of 2 day restriction over an outright ban (126 as opposed to 83).\n\nThanks for your understanding !",

Unpopular opinions doesn't allow generational posts, you get kicked off of every Star Trek page if you are even mildly conservative, dankmemes is just gone. \n\nWon't be long and all social media apps will just be completely sterilized but dead. I for one can't wait. It's going to be hilarious.",

I can say what I want, you can say what you want about what I want, and neither of us is allowed to hit the other one for pissing somebody off.\n\nIf you dont feel safe speaking certain words, then there is something wrong and its not you",

Theyll then call you a nazi because everyones ideals are accepted in their culture except any that they dont like.\n\nOh also political posts arent allowed over in r/facepalm. But people do it anyway for karma farming since the mods dont do shit. \n\nRule 9 states no posts about politicians doing politician things\n\nRule 10 states no attacking a political party. (Which they do anyway)\n\nThe mods dont do shit and have left that sub to die in extreme leftism instead of light hearted human stupidity"
