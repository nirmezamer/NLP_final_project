        "content": "First off, apologies for delaying the outcome of the recent poll (https://www.reddit.com/r/memesopdidnotlike/s/DbbahUEg70).  After much deliberation, our mod team has decided using the data gathered from the poll to restrict political posts to the weekends, like BoysAreQuirky posts.  This is a trial ban on political posts, and we may adjust the policy in the coming weeks. The action taken is the limitation of these kind of submissions since more people chose some form of 2 day restriction over an outright ban (126 as opposed to 83).\n\nThanks for your understanding !",

            "We announced this now, opposed to during the weekdays to avoid confusion on when this goes into affect.  I\u2019m definitely in the boat that the ban on politics is cringe, but here we are.  This is what a majority of the sub voted for.  As stated by the auto-mod, this restriction is in a trial phase for two weeks minimum.\n\nWe understand this decision is going to upset lots of you, but we promised our community as mods that we serve them first and foremost.  And by doing that, we\u2019re going to honor the results of the polls.  The validity of the polls is definitely questionable (we\u2019re not going to gaslight you like a certain country\u2019s election, if you get my drift).  \n\nIt\u2019s definitely questionable how much interaction a poll gets versus traffic in a community.  When many users interact with our subreddit, it is likely through their feed.  The feed pushes recent or trending posts, not polls.  Polls are only \u201cvisible\u201d to a subset of our community, usually longtime engaged members.  This sub has only become as political as it has in the last several months.  The older part of our community expresses a great disdain for the direction of our subreddit, and petitioned to ban politics.  And naturally, as mentioned before, this dedicated subgroup was far more likely to vote in the polls than the average demographic.\n\nI tried to bring the community\u2019s attention towards this monument decision process by bringing attention towards it, namely through sticky comments on posts regarding this topic.  But I\u2019m not going to lie to you to cover my ass.  I failed greatly in this regard.  In hindsight what I should have done was edit the automod comment on every post to mention the various polls and links to them.  I know most people don\u2019t read that automod comment, but at least it would have drawn more awareness towards this.\n\n~~This is probably just me feeling butt-hurt that my side on this matter lost out\u2026~~.  Please share your honest thoughts on this posts, the most valuable thing to our team is community feedback.  We allow dissenting views here, we encourage you to speak your mind!",

Unpopular opinions doesn't allow generational posts, you get kicked off of every Star Trek page if you are even mildly conservative, dankmemes is just gone. \n\nWon't be long and all social media apps will just be completely sterilized but dead. I for one can't wait. It's going to be hilarious.",
            "Aaand here\u2019s what I was looking for. I wanted to make a post analyzing the situation that people (political left and political right) argued about (was about transgenderism and transphobia) and I tried commenting a few times to no avail. I made a joke to myself saying \u201coh they\u2019re censoring this\u201d but i refresh and then nothing. I go to my history and see a mod pinned comment saying the post has been being removed. I wanted to voice my opinion to the mod but couldn\u2019t so I looked for a mod list but found this. I\u2019ve decided to voice my opinion here without being aggressive but still affirmative: \n\n\nI am strongly against this\n\nThis is censorship and I feel that this should be discussed.\n\nI understand that people could argue about this elsewhere but when you have a post and then censor it, you cut off arguments that could be very valid or progressive, and I do believe it\u2019s important to have these arguements when the whole point of this sub is to have posts that are based upon disagreements between the first OP, the Reposter, and the r/memesopdidnotlike reposter"
