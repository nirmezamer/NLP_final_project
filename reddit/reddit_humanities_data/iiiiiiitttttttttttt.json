I also now monitor response times from multiple targets to see issues.\n\nHere's a fun story:\n\nThe person on the phone told me that it is impossible to connect a laptop directly to a modem in bridge mode. After I told them that it is possible, they told me to hold, and probably asked their coworker.\n\nThey were unable to comprehend what I was saying when I told them there were high packet losses towards Cloudflare, and that I am unable to ping 1.1.1.1. \"Are there issues with the 1.1.1.1 version of Cloudflare or what?\"\n\nThey asked whether I was using Google's DNS when pinging Cloudflare (not sure how DNS affects ICMP, but if they say so it must be true haha). They also asked whether I was using their DHCP server. I wanted to ask what alternative DHCP servers they know about.\n\nAfter all this, they told me once again, that they do not see a problem, and I should call a programmer (yes, a programmer). I asked whether he tried pinging the IP himself, and he said yes, it worked for him through [ping.eu](http://ping.eu), I was speechless after this. I told him that [ping.eu](http://ping.eu) is not inside their network, it just proves that the issue is not global. I asked him to ping locally, or on one of their routers, he was unable to do this. He said he doesn't have time for this, and hang up on me.",

Apparently the switch under the sidewalk that feeds my house was burnt to a crisp. Dude literally said \u201c how are u even getting internet right now!?!\u201d  They replaced it and after I bitched to them again for credits they upped my speeds from 150 to 500Mbps for $10 less than what I was paying for 150.
