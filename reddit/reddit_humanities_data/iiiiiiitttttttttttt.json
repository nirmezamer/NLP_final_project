I also now monitor response times from multiple targets to see issues.\n\nHere's a fun story:\n\nThe person on the phone told me that it is impossible to connect a laptop directly to a modem in bridge mode. After I told them that it is possible, they told me to hold, and probably asked their coworker.\n\nThey were unable to comprehend what I was saying when I told them there were high packet losses towards Cloudflare, and that I am unable to ping 1.1.1.1. \"Are there issues with the 1.1.1.1 version of Cloudflare or what?\"\n\nThey asked whether I was using Google's DNS when pinging Cloudflare (not sure how DNS affects ICMP, but if they say so it must be true haha). They also asked whether I was using their DHCP server. I wanted to ask what alternative DHCP servers they know about.\n\nAfter all this, they told me once again, that they do not see a problem, and I should call a programmer (yes, a programmer). I asked whether he tried pinging the IP himself, and he said yes, it worked for him through [ping.eu](http://ping.eu), I was speechless after this. I told him that [ping.eu](http://ping.eu) is not inside their network, it just proves that the issue is not global. I asked him to ping locally, or on one of their routers, he was unable to do this. He said he doesn't have time for this, and hang up on me.",
