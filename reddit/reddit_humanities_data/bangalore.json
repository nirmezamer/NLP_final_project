It's dedicated to promoting cultural diversity and social harmony through music. I tried contacting Deccan herald been 2 weeks and there's no response.

            "Hey guys,\n\nSo I am about to complete my masters in international business from Germany. However, I have decided to come back to Bangalore since I realized that life in Europe is not what I really want.\n\nI am already working there as a student at the stock exchange, and they have offered to convert it into full time too. However, besides the pay in Germany, everything else is a con in my opinion. Therefore, I would like to move back to Bangalore where I did my bachelors (Christ) and find work here.\n\nHowever, I wanted to ask what's the best way to start looking for work here. As far as I know, most of these Big 4 and other firms hire directly from University and if you want to apply as an outsider, you need lots of experience. I have only worked for 1.5 years after my bachelors. But I am open to all organisations.\n\nAny tips would be appreciated.

            "In my personal opinion and observation, I think it's mostly the cars and bigger vehicles that cause a hindrance and force 2 wheelers to play 'tetris'. If cars stick to lane discipline and follow a single line instead of zig zags (while one car drives on the left side of the lane, the car behind drives on the right side of the same lane), then two wheelers don't have to try and squeeze through every gap they can find. \n\nThere are no 2-wheeler specific lanes so obviously we will have merged traffic. But in most cases, in a 2 lane Street, you will find 3 cars trying to squeeze into those 2 lanes. If cars and bigger vehicles start following lane disciplines and drive in the middle of their designated lanes, then on most main roads there will be enough space on the sides for two wheelers to comfortably ride without having to squeeze in or cut through. \n\nDrivers tend to change lanes without even signalling. Lot of car drivers don't even look at the side mirrors before changing lanes. Worst are the ones that create pockets of space by being in the middle of 2 lanes and blocking off traffic.",

But after coming to blr, I've been scolded by people to stop behind the white line on traffic signals, not squeezing myself through that gap on the left of a bmtc bus, of not letting people drive on footpath by blocking the way. At this point I just play Tetris on the road out of frustration. I'm fine even if it takes me more time, but I can't stand other people honking at me anymore"
