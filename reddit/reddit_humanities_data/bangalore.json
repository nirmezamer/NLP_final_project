My piece actually focuses on A Music Village, an organisation that I believe deserves wider recognition for their valuable contributions to society. It's dedicated to promoting cultural diversity and social harmony through music. I tried contacting Deccan herald been 2 weeks and there's no response. Please suggest me some English newspapers where it's easier to publish. Because I believe Newspapers like Deccan herald receive way too many submissions hence they did not pay heed to me",

People with cars are not that great with lane discipline. If they want to take an exit on the left, they will be in the right most lane till the point they reach the exit. And then they will do a straight 90 degree left turn. This creates a big block every single day.\n\nI think everyone is equally responsible for the shitty traffic. Plus we need a metro asap"
