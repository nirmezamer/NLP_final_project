I've got back into producing after a nearly 10 year break recently and used to do the FTCs on here back then, so it was  a lot of fun doing another one as a re-intro to the hobby.\n\nHere's my pick for the next sample, had it saved on a playlist of potential samples and haven't used it yet so thought it'd be a good candidate:\n\n# Jo\u00ebl Fajerman - Rose Des Sables\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bWKliNoQv0&ab\\_channel=AlexB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bWKliNoQv0&ab_channel=AlexB)\n\nGood luck, hope you have fun with it.\n\n**Rules -**\n\n1) You can only submit 1 beat\n\n2) You have to use the sample in your beat, it should be recognisable (don't just throw it in a granular synth lol). You can add other instruments and samples obvs, but the sample should be a main element.\n\n3) Beats can be any genre, no bonus points for making a specific genre beat\n\n4) Deadline - 4 July 2024\n\n**How to win? -**\n\nAny submissions submitted before the deadline, will be uploaded on the voting post, whoever gets the most votes wins. Winner gets to decide the sample for the next FTC and has to make the next post.",

In that time I created as much as I could and worked on improving my craft. I\u2019ve desired to get my work onto streaming in the hopes of reaching more people to make new connections and find people who resonate with my art. With that being said, I recently released this short little EP as a starting off point. These tracks were initially made with the intention of rapping over them, but after I recorded some tracks I felt that the instrumentals worked better as a standalone piece. I am super proud of how the entire project turned out and I feel the tracks work well together. \n\nIf you have seven minutes of your time to give this a listen it would make my day. Any feedback or advice (or comments in general) would also be greatly appreciated so I can improve my next release(s). \n\nThank you for reading, stay blessed.",

            "Im gonna drop a first impressions review on each:\n\n1. Sounds a lot like something j cole or ab soul could use\n\n2. That second one is quite literally perfection to me. Perfect mix if jazz sound. Idk who could flow on that sound in modern rap though\n\n3. I dont like this one personally\n\n4. The only type of beat with a bit of a west coast feel that i actually like. (Im not from cali but this one made me feel like i was IN cali) \n\n5. I LOVE that piano pattern even though its a simple one, drums seem a bit loud for my taste but they arent bad for it\n\n6. I would find a way to eliminate that dead sound in the middle, unless you use it as a way to flow into a beat switch maybe? Similar to 7 Minute Drill J Cole\u2019s beat switch and producer sound? Generally a fairly easy on the ears sound and might not be a full beat worthy but for a switch INTO a full beat switch, may be peak\n\n7/10 from a random nobody with fairly picky ears\n\nEdit: wheres the apple music link man you gotta get it accessible to people who hate using spotify lol",
