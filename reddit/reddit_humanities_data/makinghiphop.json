            "I like this mane this is good. Your cadence is really good. Flow is good and I like the switch ups. You doing your thing keep going only constructive feedback I have is maybe a better beat. Not to say that this one isnt good, it fits your style. But that could really take your game to the next level imo.",
            "This is genuinely really good, unique style as well. Love the little melodies mixed in too. Keep it up, you have something.",
            "This is dope man. Got a concrete boys vibe from this. Don't really have any notes, think you did your thing with this.",
            "Half way through I started to wonder if it was going to develop any more (other than having hook/bridge sections) then you switched it up towards the end. Fire  its always the dudes with less followers/engagement that got better beats tbh",
            "This pretty good, better than anything I had 4 months in thats forsure. I would say add some sort of intro rather than jumping straight into the beat. Drums are good i fw the kick and the patterns. Im a fan of the lead synth sound and notes. I feel like (and this is subjective) the main synths that repeat the three notes could be smoother. Keep going ",
            "Flow is good, beat is good. Overall vibe is consistent. I would say to play around with some vocal effects/presets to really find your sound. And imo with a genre like this I think it sounds better when theres more inflection and variety in the artists voice (pitch, flow, emotion etc)",
            "This shit harddd, could honestly imagine this on Live Love A$AP or smth \n\nGood work ",
            "Thank you manyou keep it up as well!!!!",
            "thanks bro, appreciate the feedback! the mix is very good, overall I think it could be a perfect background to some kind of chase scene during Cyberpunk77 game. my fav part is probably this 'guitarish' sounding counter melody, kinda neptune-ish and that stuttery thing that comes in at 0:53. the siren sound at 0:25 and at :1:17 kinda throws me off, I think it fades away kinda awkwardly, in contrast to the initial one before the first drop which flows seamless. but given the context of a C77 chase that I was imagining it could kinda fit. all in all it's really good tho!"

I've got back into producing after a nearly 10 year break recently and used to do the FTCs on here back then, so it was  a lot of fun doing another one as a re-intro to the hobby.\n\nHere's my pick for the next sample, had it saved on a playlist of potential samples and haven't used it yet so thought it'd be a good candidate:\n\n# Jo\u00ebl Fajerman - Rose Des Sables\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bWKliNoQv0&ab\\_channel=AlexB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bWKliNoQv0&ab_channel=AlexB)\n\nGood luck, hope you have fun with it.\n\n**Rules -**\n\n1) You can only submit 1 beat\n\n2) You have to use the sample in your beat, it should be recognisable (don't just throw it in a granular synth lol). You can add other instruments and samples obvs, but the sample should be a main element.\n\n3) Beats can be any genre, no bonus points for making a specific genre beat\n\n4) Deadline - 4 July 2024\n\n**How to win? -**\n\nAny submissions submitted before the deadline, will be uploaded on the voting post, whoever gets the most votes wins. Winner gets to decide the sample for the next FTC and has to make the next post.",

        "content": "Hey guys, I'm using Ableton, one thing I cannot figure out is that when tutorials on YouTube doing hat rolls with decreasing velocity in FL, they don't sound like rolls anymore, sounded more like they be having a \"delay\" on one note only (meaning if I put a delay on one hat with sync turned off, adjusting with millisecond, would be the closest method to replicate that sound).  \nWhen try to do the exact same thing in Ableton, they sound \"stiff\", just like normal rolls.  \n  \nSimilar with 808 rolls, they like to do it with increasing velocity to achieve that reverse-ish effect, but in Ableton, I still got a \"stiff\" sound.  \n  \nFamous song reference:  \nHat rolls in Not Like Us by Kendrick  \n808 rolls in The Box by Roddy Ricch  \n  \nI have tried adjusting ADSR, snap, warp, vel>vol percentage(this helps, but not close enough, I want that bounciness and smoothness)  \n  \nWhy is this and how could I do the same trick?
