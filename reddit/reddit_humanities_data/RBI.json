This assumes she has the full identity information of the employer or can get it (may need SSN, TIN if filing 1099s as an entity, etc.).\n\nOf course they could have been doing all of this under some shell company that's now BK, who knows, but they will turn up somewhere eventually and it sounds worth chasing.",

        "content": "Pardon me if this is a silly or dumb topic, but I'm really curious about this. \n\nMy friend and I recently discovered a small river/creek in our city. We only first started going there a couple days ago. The creek is near a large bowling alley.\n\nA few days ago, while I was away, my friend found a Brunswick Trac-Master T2 bowling ball in the water,  which is a type of ball from the '60s. It was caked in dirt to the point she couldn't even see what color it is and she needed to clean it for hours, which leads us to believe it had been there for a very long time. \n\nYesterday, we went back to the creek and, to our surprise, found even more bowling balls as we explored further. We weren't even looking that hard, we just bumped into them left and right as we walked through the water. There must have been at least 10 in total, but I don't doubt that there are way more hiding in the water since we only explored a section.\n\nI chose a ball to take home at random, too, and mine turned out to be an AMF Cobra, which is from the late '80s through the '90s. It must have been in the creek for a shorter amount of time than the Brunswick, because it was not as dirty and a quick spray with the hose removed most of the mud. This begs the question, how long has this madness been going on?\n\nWe have three theories:\n\n1- the bowling alley discards unwanted trash in this creek.\n\n2- people steal balls and throw them in the water to be funny or mischievous \n\n3- members of bowling leagues get angry after doing poorly and throw away their equipment \n\nOr perhaps a mixture of all of these factors.\n\nIs this, like... A thing that happens?? Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I'm so confused! ",

            "Since this is actually near an established bowling alley with what \u201cI assume\u201d is a history dating to/past the 60s, I want to assume that this is some sort of ritual. Maybe if you score a perfect game you throw the ball into the creek as a thanks to the bowling gods? Stranger things have happened.",

            "If they were all pre-70s I would suspect someone dumping MEK (or a similar chemical) soaked balls after the competitive and league rules started changing. Also, I believe hardness rules have progressively changed over the years so someone dumping balls when they can't use them competitively anymore? Did the ball from the 60s seem \"softer\"? (Which is the effect MEK has on bowling  or possibly because it's been submerged so long it would be impossible to tell if from being soaked before being thrown in the creek.",
            "Maybe there are bowlers who practice a ritual of some sort that involves water. Sort of a bowling ball baptism. One would think, however, that after the baptism of the balls the bowler would take it to the bowling alley. \n\nGod works in mysterious ways.",
