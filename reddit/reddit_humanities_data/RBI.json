Apparently a Boy Scout was throwing rocks or possibly shooting into the air and somehow a rock or bullet hit some other boy scout in the head and he died. My papaw said they were on a camping trip when this happened. The boy that was throwing might have even been on top of a hill or something and the boy that died was on lower ground. I\u2019ve looked up the general terms on google and can\u2019t find anything. Thank you guys for your help ",

            "Our library offers databases which are searchable by key word and date, so \"boy scout\" and \"death\" and dates 1950-1960 for that area will find the information in newspapers from that area. So I would check the libraries from those two spots. Often if you just email them, they will perform a search.\n\nOur library charged $15 an hour to search, but for a simple request like yours, which takes moments to perform, they would not have charged.\n\nThe newspaper databases are amazing. Once you find an article you can easily crop and print it, or save to email, etc.\n\nDo be prepared for this to be a vague story handed down from Boy Scout to Boy Scout that never really happened."

        "content": "Pardon me if this is a silly or dumb topic, but I'm really curious about this. \n\nMy friend and I recently discovered a small river/creek in our city. We only first started going there a couple days ago. The creek is near a large bowling alley.\n\nA few days ago, while I was away, my friend found a Brunswick Trac-Master T2 bowling ball in the water,  which is a type of ball from the '60s. It was caked in dirt to the point she couldn't even see what color it is and she needed to clean it for hours, which leads us to believe it had been there for a very long time. \n\nYesterday, we went back to the creek and, to our surprise, found even more bowling balls as we explored further. We weren't even looking that hard, we just bumped into them left and right as we walked through the water. There must have been at least 10 in total, but I don't doubt that there are way more hiding in the water since we only explored a section.\n\nI chose a ball to take home at random, too, and mine turned out to be an AMF Cobra, which is from the late '80s through the '90s. It must have been in the creek for a shorter amount of time than the Brunswick, because it was not as dirty and a quick spray with the hose removed most of the mud. This begs the question, how long has this madness been going on?\n\nWe have three theories:\n\n1- the bowling alley discards unwanted trash in this creek.\n\n2- people steal balls and throw them in the water to be funny or mischievous \n\n3- members of bowling leagues get angry after doing poorly and throw away their equipment \n\nOr perhaps a mixture of all of these factors.\n\nIs this, like... A thing that happens?? Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I'm so confused! ",

(Which is the effect MEK has on bowling  or possibly because it's been submerged so long it would be impossible to tell if from being soaked before being thrown in the creek.",

        "content": "Hey! I\u2019m a little shaken up at the moment so I figured posting this might help a bit, I was researching and saw similar posts here before but none of them 100% describe what I just experienced so I figured hey maybe there\u2019ll be different answers that make a bit more sense for me?\n\nI just woke up, around 4:00AM, NE USA, which on its own isn\u2019t too strange, but I was having a lot of trouble falling back asleep despite being tired. It took a bit, but I noticed a very consistently timed, barely audible beeping noise. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint where it was coming from but it was so quiet and high pitched it was barely discernible from my tinnitus. It would beep for maybe 3 seconds, silence for 2 seconds, repeating over and over like that. On its own, not too strange, I figured it might be some electronic doing something funky or it might even just be in my head. It got weird when I heard family members start talking on the other side of the house, I couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying but it was very sudden as though they had been mid conversation or like the conversation very quickly started. Then, at almost the same time, one of my cats started whining. She\u2019s not a particularly skittish cat and she never cries or complains, but she eventually found her way to my bedroom where she made a kinda low grumbling noise, which was also out of the ordinary. Then, perfectly in line with all of this happening, the motion sensing light in my driveway, right outside the window next to my head, flicked on. I swallowed my nerves and looked but I didn\u2019t see anything out there to set it off.\n\nI spent some time researching the usual answers to these questions and I wanna rule out some things right from the start - the sound itself is not similar to any of the smoke or carbon monoxide alarms we have in the house, and it\u2019s way too quiet to be effective if it was. The nearest crosswalk to my house is at least 2 miles away, so it shouldn\u2019t be that. It also sounded way too electronic and perfectly timed to be any kind of animal, plus any animal sounds that have been suggested on posts like this sounded very different.\n\nIt\u2019s alright if nobody has an answer, though one would be appreciated for peace of mind. It was mostly the combination of everything with the light turning on and the cat freaking out that got me a little nervous, but typing it all out has helped me relax a little already.",
