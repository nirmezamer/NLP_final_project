Using imgur or some other hosting service, [send the mods a picture](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/hvacadvice) that includes your license, EPA card, or a qualifying certificate *along with* a piece of paper that has your Reddit username and the date. **All** identifying information, such as phone or license numbers, names, or companies should be redacted. This is basically the verification system used on gonewild but applied to good purposes, not just awesome ones. Once you have your flair, please feel free to delete your picture.\n\n* If you are giving advice from an unflaired account, it may be removed at a moderator's discretion.\n* **All advice given must be safe.** An immediate ban will be given to anybody who, in the moderator's assessment, is knowingly giving out unsafe advice. If a reply to your question seems sketchy, \"report\" the post, and a mod will check it out.\n* **All advice given must be public.** Anyone asking you to PM them or who messages you with a solution that they don't want to post in the sub is quite possibly advocating a potentially dangerous fix. Don't engage them, and report the post to the mods.\n* **Mods have the right to revoke your flair based on bad practices/bad advice at our discretion.** You will receive a Probation flair, and after 6 months, you may get your flair back.

You can not post your company's contact information, or the contact information of any specific service provider for any reason.\n\n* It must also be noted that Reddit automatically removes posts or comments containing links from Alibaba, link-shortening websites, amazon (almost always), and image-hosting services other than imgur, among others. The mods do not have time to police removed comments or posts to check if the link was okay and we will not reapprove them, so just don't post links.\n* Offers of jobs or requests for employees are prohibited.\n* You can not link to the service that you are making. You can not link to a survey for people. You can not ask about lead generation. You can not link a poll. No companies offering a service on this sub are allowed. Your post will be removed and you will be banned.\n\n**5) Some things are not safe to DIY and are not open to discussion.** An up-to-date list will always be located on the subreddit's sidebar.\n\n**6) Keep in mind that those who chose to answer your questions** are doing so out of the goodness of their own heart and spending their very valuable time trying to help you. Please be kind and respectful and you will be treated the same.\n\n**7) Basic civility is required.** No politics, name-calling, or other nonsense.\n\n* Follow [reddiquette](https://web.archive.org/web/20220821120517/https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and be polite.\n* We will remove shitty comments and ban assholes.

They are belligerent and feel that our training, cost of tools, cost of doing business and experience somehow relate to what he can go online and buy a part for. You would be even more upset if i let you know that thermostat you found online is about 2X more expensive than what we can buy it for as contractors from wholesalers.",

The issue was that there was a short in the wire harrness between the air handler and heat pump.  Tech just used another unused wire in same harness.  I believe the thermostat was bad, the previous owners let batteries corrode in it and it the display was still intermittent when i put fresh in.  But no, I\u2019m not certain and just went with what service guy said",

        "content": "This is looking from top at the outside HVAC unit. I called an HVAC guy and he removed the outer cover and the capacitor. I was surprised (perhaps shocked is the right word) because there was like a pile of mulch like stuff built in there and you can see a bunch that has fallen on the ground. It looked as if some animal did that? But I am not sure which animal would do that, or even how it managed to get in there when the cover was in place. The HVAC problem itself was due to capacitor having gone bad, an electric wire connecting to the capacitor was basically melted /burned. Once the HVAC guy replaced the capacitor and trimmed and reconnected the wire, cleaned up the area, it is working fine. Part of me was worried that given the electric wire had melted in proximity of the pile of mulch, it could also have caught fire. Luckily, no fire. Am I unnecessarily worried? Any lessons for me for the future?",

Came back 6.25 for another 4 ish hours. Today, still no cool air. Told TXV needs replaced. Waiting on part. Quoted another 8 hours labour to replace. Outdoor unit is a 2011.\nAttaching photos of labour notes, model details and readings sent from company.\nSo far, charged $2,700 for diagnostics, journeyman cost and some parts. Expected to increase significantly for TXV install.\n\nDoes this seem on the level? I don\u2019t want to be a whiner if not, but the time buddy was here seemed excessive given what was done.\n\nThanks for taking the time!",

            "I\u2019m not residential anymore but that looks high. They are already charging you for the labor so to charge you again for the recovery and brazing is ridiculous. Not to mention they are charging you for the basic tool every service tech has. Microtransactions are killing everyone.",

            "Doesn't mean jack shit",
            "IR thermometers are great for a rough idea but...no, that's the totally wrong way to check temp split.  Should be measured immediately before the air handler in the duct and immediately after the air handler in the duct.\n\nThe IR thermometer is useful for \"I can't tell if anything is happening\" as a preliminary guess...but its going to vary depending on the material (plastic/metal), if its painted, glossy, or flat, and the quality and length of the duct between the air handler and vent.  If that's going thru a hot attic and a long run to the vent...quite possible the unit has a 20-25F split and its warming up by 10-15F between the air handler and/or the emissivity of the vent surface is wrong for the IR thermometer's calibration.  Its easier to see the problems with how they measure some surfaces using a thermal camera....and you can sometimes see your own warm reflection in surfaces that you know are cool to the touch!\n\nWe use the IR ones at my office to get an idea \"is the HVAC working at all\" before putting in a ticket but that's like \"is the area around the vent 90F or 60-70F\"",

            "The IR thermometer readings show surface temp, not actual air temp. It\u2019s a close approximation, but there\u2019s no way to determine a proper temp split. He would need to stick an actual thermometer there and measure air temp. Also, is the unit running single stage or multistage? \nThis inspector doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. So get an actual HVAC company out anyway to check it over.",
