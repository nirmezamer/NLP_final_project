            "Pilot episode? They still have to shoot a pilot episode to see if HBO wants to commit to a full series? I thought the show was already ordered straight-to-series? Why'd they act like the show is a certainty that will definitely run for ten years if they're not even sure it will make it past the pilot?",

They had just watched Voldy blast aside Kingsley, Minerva and Slughorn as if they were children and before this, saw what they believed was Harry's dead body. Imagine the shock and happiness they must have felt, when they realised that their only hope of victory was not dead, when he pulled of his invisibilty cloak.\n\nHarry speech to Voldemort, telling him why he failed, Snape's true allegiance and calling him \"Riddle\" to his face, must have felt like a massive slap in the face to everyone there. Voldemort was the most feared wizard in all of Britan by that point and to see this 17- year old kid, absoultely humiliate him infront of everyone would have cemented Harry as a legend forever, especially considering how powerful Voldmort was and how everyone was too afraid to even speak his name.\n\nAnd then, Voldemort looked even more foolish, after Harry tells him that he was the true master of the elder wand, the killing curse backfires on him, the wand which he thought was his, flew towards it's true master and Tom ended up dying a completely ordinary and unremarkable death, the thing he feared more than anything else.\n\nTo see this extremely evil and powerful wizard, humanised infront of the entire Wizarding World, by a boy whom he completely underistimated, was insanely satisfying to read.",

            "I mean Harry had to prove to everyone that Voldemort, while indeed a powerful wizard, was in the end only a big bully who hid behind an aura of mystery in order to generate fear and relied on people being divided so he could conquer them. But when people got to see him other than dueling, Harry revealed Voldemort's face who was nothing but an arrogant but ignorant bully desperate for being special. And even his death shows just that when he collapses dead like any normal human.",

To spend years on a plan that he wouldn't even be alive to witness the outcome of, all because he was the recipient of a prophesy that no one else knew about except him and one other person. And to have to keep that secret for so long with someone from whom you couldn't be more opposite. To put them at risk and a child at risk because you knew there was only one way to ensure victory. And then to realize that it's precisely for all the reasons you stated, that the prophecy is better left unknown to most. That Harry being seen as symbol of strength and courage is more important than simply being the chosen one.",

I mean, I get that the wand serve as a conductor (while transferring powers of the wand to the users in Elder Wand Case). But if they had to learn nonverbally spells than why shouldn't they learn how to use magic without a wand?\n\nEdited; And to be clear. Wandless Magic is not more powerful than wand magic nor is wand magic more powerful than wandless magic. Natty claim that using a wand is just as powerful as wandless magic.

            "Honestly I don't believe for one minute that Dumbledore would have chosen not to teach the kids a life saving back up just because of culture etc. Its a plothole if you ask me. Being able to easily cast spells without a wand is too much of an ex machina so of course the characters couldn't do that, but that means it shouldn't have been a thing in the lore at all.",

There's nothing in the hp universe near as bad as Lovecraft ofcourse, but the same point stand fundamentally, we can't ignore it, so we should consider why she said stuff, and examine if it came fron her implicit biases or whatever.",
            "Real reason? Because they needed to unnecessarily invent a reason for African wizards/witches to be better/cooler than European ones. It makes no sense that it is that accessible that an entire wizarding culture doesn't even bother using wands, but Hogwarts in the books doesn't even hint that such a mode of spellcasting exists.\n\nThere is literally no reason to not teach wandless magic, if it's something that's possible in the HP universe. That's why it not being a required part of the Hogwarts curriculum makes zero sense.,",

        "content": "okay hear me out...\n\nI don't like Snape, I think he's an awful person and only a really messed up person bullies a child but ...I think I kind of understand why Harry might have named his child Albus Severus\n\npeople often argue that Harry should have instead named his child after Hagrid or Lupin or one of the other heroes or good guys but I   think of it this way:\n\nHagrid was undoubtedly a far better positive force in Harry's life and a better person by far than Snape. but we know that Hagrid was beloved by many and spent his old age surrounded by his friends and their children in a home he loved. he will be remembered long after he passes away\n\nsimilarly, Lupin is a true hero, he had a tragic life but he always tried to do good and will be remembered as a hero and true friend by many people. he also has a son to carry on his name that will grow up learning about the great people his parents were\n\nSnape on the other hand was loved by no one and will likely be remembered by no one. This is of course because of his own choices but he did admittedly have a pretty tragic life. \n\nI think Harry naming his child \"severus\" is Harry symbolically forgiving Snape for how he treated him and for his part in getting his parents killed.\n\nI think Harry recognised that Snape spent the final 17 years or so of his life, miserable and distraught by guilt for what he had done, and he put himself in immense danger to try and make it up to Lilly and ultimately paid with his life.\n\nI don't think Harry ever liked Snape or would ever have liked him. I don't think he believes snapes actions were for anyone other than lilly but I do think Harry recognised snapes awful life and the fact that no one would remember the good he did, so I think Harry naming his son Albus Severus is Harry saying \"I know you tried to make it up to my mother, you gave everything in the end, so I forgive you and I'll make sure at least someone remembers you\"\n\nwhat do people think?",

So we talked about it a little and then she says okay. So that's why he named his kid after him?? Even the 9 year old questions it. Lol. But anyways. I cant wait til she wakes up and I can read this post to her because I really think she will appreciate it.",
            "Also I feel the conjunction of Severus's name with Albus symbolically represents how in wars the lines between perceived hero and villain are often blurred. More than simply lightness and darkness, there exists a grey area and in reality most people more often than not fall into this area. Harry who was always the representation of victory over dark powers since his birth somehow keeps his child free of such simplistic demarcation. Even though both Dumbledore and Snape in the end died defending the light, they both nonetheless were much different than how they were perceived by the wizarding world while they were alive. Neither was Dumbledore representative of strength of good and righteous through and through nor was Snape an evil ex death Eater and Voldemort sympathiser through and through. In the end, lines blurred.",
