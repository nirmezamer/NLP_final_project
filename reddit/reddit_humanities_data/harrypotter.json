(Uncle Vernon)\n\n>'They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,' said Aunt Petunia.\n\nEveryone is shocked, (even herself) and when she tries to explain to her husband how she knew she says this:\n\n>'I heard - that awful boy - telling *her* about them - years ago,' she said jerkily.\n\nAnd Harry is annoyed because she doesn't use his parent's name.\n\n>'If you mean my mum and dad, why don't you use their names?' said Harry loudly.\n\nBut I don't think she meant his parents. Because if you check DH again, you'll realize, that it wasn't James who told Lily about the Dementors, but it was.... nah I won't spoil it for you, read:\n\n>'Severus?  \n\u2019A little smile twisted Snape\u2019s mouth when she said his name.  \n\u2018Yeah?\u2019  \n\u2018Tell me about the Dementors again.\u2019  \n\u2018What d\u2019you want to know about them for?\u2019  \n\u2018If I use magic outside school \u2013\u2019  \n\u2018They wouldn\u2019t give you to the Dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You\u2019re not going to end up in Azkaban, you\u2019re too \u2013\u2019\n\nAnd as you know, Petunia was 'spying' on them.\n\n>Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing\n\nPetunia meant Snape.",

            "Yes she meant Snape.\n\nIt's written to trick the reader until that chapter in DH. Everybody thought she was referring to James obviously, but then DH came out and it was clear that she meant Snape. The saga uses internal ambiguous references to create continuity throughout the books.\n\nAlso, Petunia is \"horribly flustered\" when she mentions the \"awful boy\" in that passage from OOTP. But when she speaks about James and Lily in PS, she's not flustered, she's angry. She rants. She's not merely nervous.",
