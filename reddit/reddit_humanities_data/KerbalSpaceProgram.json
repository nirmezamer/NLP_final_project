I tried rotating them, I tried holding alt (but I'm on a Mac so I think it's right shift instead?) but no matter what these items will not snap to the floor, ceiling, or walls of the inside of my service bay.

        "content": "Hi /r/KerbalSpaceProgram,\n\nA couple of weeks ago, some of the moderators [held a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1d7dujg/poll_for_allowingbanning_ksp2_layoffrelated/) asking you how discussions regarding the Intercept Games layoffs should be handled. After community feedback, and consulting with the wider moderation team, we have come to the conclusion that the decision to restrict all discussion about the layoffs to one [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1dby3us/megathread_for_layoffrelated_questions/) was a mistake, and for that we apologise.\n\nThe restrictions on layoff-related discussions have been lifted, and this thread will remain stickied to centralise information about events regarding the layoffs. Hopefully, this will avoid submissions and comments repeating the same question. \n\nLastly, as a reminder, despite emotions running high, Rules 1 and 5 do still apply. Discussions about how poorly decisions have been made are allowed, but named attacks on Intercept Games staff are not. Be kind, these people are about to lose their jobs.\n\nThank you, \n\n/r/KerbalSpaceProgram mod team\n\n**CURRENT LAYOFF INFORMATION (AS OF 19/06/24)**\n\n* Intercept Games is closing on June 28th. What this means for the future of Kerbal Space Program 2 is unknown at this point. Take Two may be trying to sell the IP for Kerbal Space Program and/or sell Intercept Games.\n\n* Take Two's Q4 Earnings Call: \"We have eliminated several projects that didn't meet expectations for financial benchmarks\". Kerbal Space Program 2 is not explicitly mentioned by name in this report.\n\n* At least 70 employees under Take Two in Seattle are being laid off.\n\n* Community Managers Dakota and Mike are among those affected, and are currently looking for work, they will still be here until June 28th.",

            "I\u2019m starting to think that we won\u2019t get any information at all about the future of KSP2, even after the WARN date has passed. What an atrocious lack of communication from the team\u2026",
            "Despite media misinterpretations of the statement, Take-Two has *not* promised 'continued' support or updates for KSP2. \n\nOnly that they had update(s) in the works two months ago.\n\n> [On April 18th Private Division successfully launched Moon Studio\u2019s No Rest for the Wicked. **The label continues to make updates to Kerbal Space Program 2** and plans to release W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop Game Studio\u2019s Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game in the second half of 2024.](https://twitter.com/KerbalSpaceP/status/1785788809613082732)\n\n\"Continues to make\" is a present-tense statement made back on May 1st, over a month ago. It makes no future promises, and doesn't even promise a release of those updates. \n\n----\n\n*Additionally*, Private Division, the publisher Take-Two owns that publishes KSP2, [had already had most of its staff laid off in April](https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division). Something we didn't learn about until *after* the layoffs at In~~terc~~ept Games were discovered.\n\nWhile they did apparently have staff in Seattle, this layoff impacted [all four of its (former?) locations, including New York, Munich (M\u00fcnchen), and Las Vegas.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs) As those locations aren't in Seattle, they are **in addition to** the 70 people being laid off in Seattle mentioned in the WARN Act notice.\n\nThere are probably a few people remaining working under the Private Division name, as Take-Two has stated that they're continuing to try to get a couple other games (not KSP2) out the door, but nothing we've heard suggests those people are working on KSP2, just on getting No Rest for the Wicked and Tales of the Shire out the door.\n\n----\n\nAs an additional little detail: the [WARN Act notice](https://esd.wa.gov/about-employees/WARN) for Take-Two's Seattle location provides more details than just 70 people losing their jobs. It also clarifies that it is due to a physical office location being shut down (the actual building). No one will be working in that physical location any more, so claims that \"a few people remain working\" by any flat-Kerbinites are not based in any evidence we have available.",
            "Will the website and forums remain up for the foreseeable future?",
            "One of you should leak the KSP 1 source code pretty please :3",
            "here\u2019s hoping development eventually gets handed off to someone who actually cares (i wouldn\u2019t put money on it though)",
            "Whats stopping them from releasing what they've done under a different title. If the IP holder folds doesn't their IP claim too?",
            ">Intercept Games is closing on June 28th\n\nAny official source for that? On the official Discord this information is listed as speculative (edit: \"pending confirmation\"). Take2 themselves claims that Intercept won't be \"shuttered\" and KSP2 will continue to receive updates.\n\nJust my opinion but I think Take2 just closes Private Division - hence removing the PD Launcher - not the studios. As an example the studio behind \"No Rest for the Wicked\" which recently launched into early access under PD is just fine.\n\nPoint is we should not treat speculative / non official information as fact.",
            "My expectation is that we're going to get a final jpeg post from them an hour before they lock the door, with no Q&A after.",

I\u2019m sure everyone that plays this game somewhat seriously has some side notes for every mission.\n\nAnywho, I decided to make a more permanent notebook for all these notes. I saw one of these NASA crew notebooks when I was watching a YouTube video of astronaut Chris Hadfield, and so I decided to make somewhat of a replica that I could use for my gameplay. I got some references, found out about the most common NASA typefaces and overall design style for their spacecraft manuals, and came up with this thing.\n\nI\u2019m not a graphic designer or anything (did this all on ms word lol) but I think it came out alright! Complete with some markers taped on the back with velcro. All in all it\u2019s pretty practical to use and I think I kinda adds little bit of roleplay, which in my book is always a plus. \n\nAll infos are based on Mike Aben\u2019s YouTube tutorials, which I think strike the perfect balance between actual math and engineering and just, well, fun lol",
