I tried rotating them, I tried holding alt (but I'm on a Mac so I think it's right shift instead?) but no matter what these items will not snap to the floor, ceiling, or walls of the inside of my service bay.

        "content": "Hi /r/KerbalSpaceProgram,\n\nA couple of weeks ago, some of the moderators [held a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1d7dujg/poll_for_allowingbanning_ksp2_layoffrelated/) asking you how discussions regarding the Intercept Games layoffs should be handled. After community feedback, and consulting with the wider moderation team, we have come to the conclusion that the decision to restrict all discussion about the layoffs to one [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1dby3us/megathread_for_layoffrelated_questions/) was a mistake, and for that we apologise.\n\nThe restrictions on layoff-related discussions have been lifted, and this thread will remain stickied to centralise information about events regarding the layoffs. Hopefully, this will avoid submissions and comments repeating the same question. \n\nLastly, as a reminder, despite emotions running high, Rules 1 and 5 do still apply. Discussions about how poorly decisions have been made are allowed, but named attacks on Intercept Games staff are not. Be kind, these people are about to lose their jobs.\n\nThank you, \n\n/r/KerbalSpaceProgram mod team\n\n**CURRENT LAYOFF INFORMATION (AS OF 19/06/24)**\n\n* Intercept Games is closing on June 28th. What this means for the future of Kerbal Space Program 2 is unknown at this point. Take Two may be trying to sell the IP for Kerbal Space Program and/or sell Intercept Games.\n\n* Take Two's Q4 Earnings Call: \"We have eliminated several projects that didn't meet expectations for financial benchmarks\". Kerbal Space Program 2 is not explicitly mentioned by name in this report.\n\n* At least 70 employees under Take Two in Seattle are being laid off.\n\n* Community Managers Dakota and Mike are among those affected, and are currently looking for work, they will still be here until June 28th.",

            "According to Dakota they will but I simply don't trust anything coming out of IG. There are already discussions among the forum mods about how to arrange the forum layout going forward. That was driven by Dakota. My problem with this is the mods of the forum are not employees. They are free labor with probably very little influence on the forums. It is however in T2's best interest to keep it going since there is a very active KSP1 community there.",

I\u2019m sure everyone that plays this game somewhat seriously has some side notes for every mission.\n\nAnywho, I decided to make a more permanent notebook for all these notes. I saw one of these NASA crew notebooks when I was watching a YouTube video of astronaut Chris Hadfield, and so I decided to make somewhat of a replica that I could use for my gameplay. I got some references, found out about the most common NASA typefaces and overall design style for their spacecraft manuals, and came up with this thing.\n\nI\u2019m not a graphic designer or anything (did this all on ms word lol) but I think it came out alright! Complete with some markers taped on the back with velcro. All in all it\u2019s pretty practical to use and I think I kinda adds little bit of roleplay, which in my book is always a plus. \n\nAll infos are based on Mike Aben\u2019s YouTube tutorials, which I think strike the perfect balance between actual math and engineering and just, well, fun lol",
