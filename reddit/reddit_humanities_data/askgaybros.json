Another neighbor referred to it as the 'gay beach'. Still not interested. Well, it seems the local police who have little to do (the most common crime is stolen bicycles) decided it would be in the public's interest to have one of the young good-looking cops hang out undercover at this beach. He arrested  6 men who supposedly 'touched' him. All were between 65 and 80 years old. The local paper thought it a good idea to shame these men by putting their names and photos on the front page. The next day, one of the men committed suicide, leaving a family behind. They  sued the police dept. for entrapment. I'm not sure what came of that, of course the paper wouldn't report that. ",

The guy brought him into the bathroom and made him suck him off. For a long time that\u2019s all I thought it was and didn\u2019t really understand why it was much of a big deal.

It wasn\u2019t until a few days ago when he brought it up again that I tried to start understanding what went on. I eventually learned that my bf had asked the guy to stop. And that the guy just hold his head down on his dick and made him swallow it. Which I know my bf wouldn\u2019t like as he hasn\u2019t been super keen on swallowing my own. After that had happened, the guy got mad at my bf and just left the club. I also learned out that my bf had then gotten an std from him and didn\u2019t have sex for a long time as he was very afraid of catching something from someone. \n\nIs this rape? What should I do.

Therapy is probably a good idea; it really helped my guy with the things that cuddles just can\u2019t touch on. It was kind of a recovered memory sort of thing that came up suddenly and he was a little out of it for a couple weeks but he\u2019s a lot better now, and we definitely owe it to therapy. I\u2019m really sorry that happened, people are shit and your boyfriend didn\u2019t deserve it. Good luck",

There are some pros and also cons to reporting this. It needs to be his decision. I think he should talk to a professional about it. Self help groups for victims of sexual assaults exist. Try to find one in your area. Maybe he might want to check it out. Just give him lots of love and understanding.",

While the Legal term for it may vary, the results are the same for the victims.",

            "Yes; he was raped.  I think that telling you, especially if you reacted sympathetically, is the first step towards his healing.  If he's been keeping this experience bottled inside of him all this time, it's hardly a wonder that he's become anxiety ridden.  The more he can talk about it, the sooner he'll come to grips with it. If this continues to live, rent-free in his head, he might need to speak to a therapist.  Good luck!",
