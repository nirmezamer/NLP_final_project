[here's the direct link to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/wiki/faq), but since it's a wiki feel free to check out the other sections and please contribute.\n\nwith that out of the way, a couple things i want to clear up in case anyone is wondering:\n\n- i do not mind repeated questions. the whole point of this subreddit is to talk to people. if it's not entertaining you anymore, maybe browse it less. no, i will not sticky every other psa post.\n- i do utilize automod extensively and it helps with a lot of troll post removal behind the scene. so if you see a troll post, continue to  downvote, report, and move on, and **do not engage**. the majority of you get this, and it's been working out quite well.\n- [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/about/rules/) haven't changed, but make sure you're aware of them.\n\nhave fun.",
