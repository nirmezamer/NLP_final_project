            "Too stupid to know he was going to get trashed.  Get your unit so half your wheels are in the ditch, leaning the trailer into the wind, stop and wait for the wind to calm down.  Or take a side road so the wind is not broadside to you, stop and wait there.  For hours if you need to, getting blown over is not an option.",
            "Super trucker of the year right here. \n\n- Too \u201ccool\u201d to wear a seatbelt( Gotta show off the flashy button up tee) \u2705 \n\n- Saw how much the trailer was getting shifted and lifted around (for how long I wonder before recording?) and decided the smart thing to do is video it \u2705\n\n- Hardly even has his hands on the steering wheel \u2705\n\n- Doesn\u2019t do the safe thing, fully sends it while not looking at the road \u2705",

            "My brothers on rubber. Train operator here. Just popping in to say if the gates come down on you, keep fkn going. They are fiberglass or aluminum and made specifically to break away. There are sensors in the machines that (usually) trip our signal system that something is wrong.\n\nAdditionally if you get stuck, do not call 911 or the local cops. FIRST FIRST FIRST look around for a metal walk in hut or metal cabinets near the crossing. On that is supposed to be a blue sign with a phone number AND additional numbers. That phone number usually goes to the train dispatcher of that line who, with the information you give him, will attempt to get all trains in that area stopped. And of course get the FUCK away from your truck or car or whatever. When we hit vehicles they fly all over the place.\n\nOnce its determined trains are stopped then get the local cops involved and tow trucks and whatnot. \n\nI dont know why this is a thing but many of our towns police along our lines dont know who to call to report stuff with the railroad OR the numbers they have will take a long time to get the info where its gotta go.\n\nPrime dude did a dummy here but managed to get it off the tracks in the nick of time.",

            "Holy hell, they're stupid, I've actually engineered that train before   it's the UTA front runner in UT, people and cars are always running through last minute causing incidents,  most the time when there's a major delays, because of an incident where someone lost a life"
