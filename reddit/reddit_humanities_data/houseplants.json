            "Does anyone have a favourite succulent? If so, why?",
            "best  make -it -yourself soil for succulents????",
            "Mesembs are so much fun to grow.  I especially like titanopsis.  Is anyone else growing them?",
            "Oooooh that is sooo cool!! I just LOVE succulents but had to give them up as I always killed them and felt so bad",
            "very cool. id like to try that someday.",
            "If you think youre gonna change me for me too good you came the wrong way shouldve took in the whole different route if you wanted to change me instead of just dumping me and leaving me in the fucking street dont you think that they did? Did they teach you guys out in medical school, I dont know if you know someones hurting they always take the easy way out made it worse. I dont know how to do that knife but you dont spit someone out and shouldnt trash and expecting to change. Its not how you do it so whatever book you on tell him, I said theyre full of you know what else",
            "The best time to prune Aucuba is in late winter to early spring before new growth begins. This timing allows the plant to recover and put out new growth during the growing season",
            "cut the large stem right below where the three mini offshoots are, and lay it on the soil in that the roots are all touching the soil. Do not bury it.\n\nmoldy leaves during propagation means you are watering it way too much. You generally just lay detached leaves on dry soil and leave them there until they have grown roots on their own.",
            "Also, if that pot has no drainage holes I would get it into something that does have drainage. Succulents like a good drink when you water but dont like wet feet.",
            "Yeah, remove all the dead leaves and material, cut the stem part at the top and you can just pus that in the soil with those cute little pups facing up, cut the main stem back too and lean that alone and youll likely get new growth from the cut point. Make sure its well draining soil and dont water until its very dry. They want lots of direct sunlight."

            "Roots are growing up into the air on my monstera plant. Any idea why or what's happening?",
            "Hi, I'm a new plant mom with a host of pothos cuttings that I've successfully rooted and transferred to soil. My issue is that I tried to research how many cuttings to place in a pot based on size and found answers ranging from 1 node more than the number of inches of the pot to one node less. So, for my 6\" pots, I went with 5 cuttings apiece. I'm not getting the full/fluffy look of some I've seen and have realized that the commercial pots have way more vines per inch, and they're also grouped more closely together than my cuttings are. I saw one person doing semi-hydro recommending 20 cuttings to a 5\" pot!\n\nI don't want to shock/traumatize my babies,  which are about 4 months old now (between water propping and transfer to soil). I'd appreciate any advice.   Should I repot and group more to a pot or leave them as is? I know I can always add in more nodes in the future,  but want to make sure I'm making the best decisions overall.",
            "Where do yall buy ceramic indoor pots (that are not expensive as hell, and also for less common sizes)?\n\nImpulse bought a new plant that's in a grower pot that's 8 inches in diameter at the top, 6.5 or 6.75 inches in diameter at the bottom, and only 6 inches in height. Online I keep finding pots that are either marked as 8 inches but actually not 8 inches all the way through, or if they are truly 8 inches wide then they're too tall. Online pot prices are also pretty ridiculous but that's another topic.",
            "I thought I asked this maybe in main group, idk how to use Reddit but happy to be here.  I bought a monstera at the grocery store the other day and forgot to bring it in - I live in vegas and it was in car for about 6 hours. Some leaves were black and wilted.  Do I cut them off? How can I fix it?",
            "I have bought a very pretty ceramic flowerpot cover (11cm internal diameter, 12 cm height) and I don't want to drill a hole in it (but given it's a flowerpot cover, I'm absolutely fine with putting another, smaller pot inside of it). What would be a good plant that would survive in conditions of rather limited drainage?\n\nI live in Poland, so my climate is somewhat similar to northeastern US (not sure if it's relevant if I'm going to keep it indoors)",
            "Hey guys!\nHow reliably does purple passion plant root from a cutting? \nMine is getting good size and I think I'd like to cut the apical merristem to even out the height.",
            "Hey guys! Bought a spider plant a couple days ago. Its my first indoor plant. Im planning to hang it after I repot it. Can I just use potting soil? Do I need to mix anything else in?",
            "My beautiful calathea has the thrips so I bought insecticide that says on the label \"Do not discharge this product into the sewage system\". My first thought would have been in the bathtub but seems that's no good. Where are you guys spraying your indoor plants? On the balcony at some point it will go into the sewage system too through the rain??",
            "Hi, new here, the tips of my philodendron imperial red are turning brown, if this is from overwatering, and I let this soil completely dry before watering again, will I still lose the leaves??",
            "Which houseplant would be best for Alaska? We keep the temp inside around 65-75 year round (using the heater in the winter and in the summer its usually around 70-75 inside). The issue is we dont get a lot of sun though whats a nice house plant that is idiot proof for us? Thank you! "
