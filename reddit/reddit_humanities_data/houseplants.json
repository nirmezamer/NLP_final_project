Which means you can take a something like a piece of a peyote the size of a pea, attach it to a fast growing cactus and turn it into the size of a golf ball in a matter of months where as even in a temperature controlled greenhouse this would take several years on its own.",

Has anyone any experience of pruning these plants? One of the branches is nearly twice the size of some of the others, so I'm thinking of loping it off, maybe shortening some of the others.",
            "K so I ordered succulents back in December. I live in Colorado and the delivery notice was a day late. So by the time I got to the mailbox, the poor things had been freezing outside for a while. I planted them anyway but between the cold and the transplant shock (and prob not the best vendor) none of them lived. Fast forward 6 mo. and my little sister decided to water the dead lil plant after I moved out. She recently brought him to my apt very proud that she revived it. But now he's a little droopy I don't know how to replant it. There are three micro plants that have sprouted and it's got little roots shooting out the stem. It VERY CLEARLY wants to live, but my succulent skills are lacking. I always end up with moldy leaves when I try to propagate succulents, and I just don't wanna sabotage his chances. HOW DO I SUPPORT HIS WILL TO LIVE?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f7ep0dxkm4d1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77c5599497e44601e86dd26bb5f818fe0289fea1",

I keep it in a north facing window and I\u2019m in a basement apartment. I\u2019ve noticed a couple leaves are spongy and a couple tips are slightly deflated. The soil is still reading moist.

            "Hi, I'm a new plant mom with a host of pothos cuttings that I've successfully rooted and transferred to soil. My issue is that I tried to research how many cuttings to place in a pot based on size and found answers ranging from 1 node more than the number of inches of the pot to one node less. So, for my 6\" pots, I went with 5 cuttings apiece. I'm not getting the full/fluffy look of some I've seen and have realized that the commercial pots have way more vines per inch, and they're also grouped more closely together than my cuttings are. I saw one person doing semi-hydro recommending 20 cuttings to a 5\" pot!\n\nI don't want to shock/traumatize my babies,  which are about 4 months old now (between water propping and transfer to soil). I'd appreciate any advice.   Should I repot and group more to a pot or leave them as is? I know I can always add in more nodes in the future,  but want to make sure I'm making the best decisions overall.",

Online I keep finding pots that are either marked as 8 inches but actually not 8 inches all the way through, or if they are truly 8 inches wide then they're too tall. Online pot prices are also pretty ridiculous but that's another topic.",

What would be a good plant that would survive in conditions of rather limited drainage?\n\nI live in Poland, so my climate is somewhat similar to northeastern US (not sure if it's relevant if I'm going to keep it indoors)"
