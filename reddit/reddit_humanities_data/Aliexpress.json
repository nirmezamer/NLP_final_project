        "content": "Writing this post in the hopes it helps someone else avoid being scammed and if they do get scammed win a dispute.\n\nI recently ordered 2 Window Air Conditioners from 2 different sellers on Ali Express on June 6th and they were to be delivered by the 14th. Combined it was about $650.00 A couple of days later I got the tracking numbers and added them to the package tracking app I use. They were odd numbers that when I tracked them pulled up a Chinese site. Since Aliexpress is based there I figured ok no big deal, I\u2019ve ordered things from places in China before. Days went by and no movements on the tracking number. Started chatting with the seller. I kept getting delays and excuses. We are checking on it, don\u2019t worry. Sorry there\u2019s an issue with our logistics system and we can\u2019t give you a waybill number right now but don\u2019t worry it\u2019s on the way. The 14th passed and then the excuses changed to we have confirmed with the logistics company it will be delivered the 19th. The 19th came and went. Did you not get it? We are checking. Then it was they\u2019ve confirmed your item was delivered on the 19th, did you not find it?\n\nAround this point I happened to notice that the tracking numbers on the orders on the website had changed. So I tracked those numbers only to find 1 said it was delivered the 11th and the other the 12th. I questioned both sellers asking why they are saying they were delivered the 19th when the tracking numbers show differently. I repeatedly asked them to confirm who was the delivery company and what was the tracking number. They both repeatedly avoided the question giving me canned excuses and responses. I noticed one tracking number said it was 1 of 3 packages, all weighing 50-60 lbs each. I only ordered one AC from each seller so that was suspicious. The other thing was it had a delivery photo from FedEx showing a house that was not mine. The other one didn\u2019t have a delivery photo but said it was left in a Locker/Storage Room which sounds like an apt complex. The other thing I noticed was all it said when I tracked them was it was delivered to Minneapolis, MN. I have an account with FedEx and I can see all packages inbound to my address. Neither tracking number was on there. And if I clicked a tracking number for something I know was mine it DID show me my name and address on the delivery event. So I called FedEx and confirmed with them that no, neither tracking number belonged to packages addressed to me and my address. \n\nI opened disputes with both sellers which of course they rejected. One of them just rejected it saying it was delivered. The other did the same and went as far as uploading a document saying it was a FedEx Proof of Delivery Receipt. I noticed it also was missing the name and address on there even though there was a Delivery Name: and Delivery Address: field on the form. I suspected strongly at this point I had became the victim of a scam. If the seller had pulled that from their FedEx account it would have shown that info. \n\nAs of today I have won one dispute, thankfully the one that didn\u2019t have the delivery photo. The other one Aliexpress is in the final stages but pretty sure I\u2019ll win it too. The seller only objected once to the solution and has never since responded. Here\u2019s what I did that I think helped. \n\n1. When you first file the dispute you have a text field to describe the problem. But that\u2019s the only time it shows up. Make sure you are as detailed as possible. Don\u2019t just put I never received the item. That\u2019s what I basically did as I didn\u2019t know it would be the only time it would appear. \n\n2. Seller will likely dispute then balls back in your court. As soon as it allows you to ask Aliexpress to step in do so. \n\n3. Upload as much photo and video evidence as you can. \n\n4. I confirmed with Aliexpress customer service their dispute team doesn\u2019t read your chat with the seller. I took screenshots of every conversation with the seller and uploaded those as evidence so they could read them. Some people say don\u2019t waste time with the seller if they aren\u2019t being helpful. I can\u2019t prove it but I think keeping on them may have helped. The dispute team was able to see that they were just repeating the same canned responses and ignoring repeated questions like asking them to confirm who was the delivery company and what was the tracking number. \n\n5. Sign up for an account on FedEx or UPS. UPS calls their system UPS MyChoice. But having an account allowed me to show all the tracking numbers that were inbound to me and that these tracking numbers were not mine. I did a screen recording on my IPad where I pulled up Aliexpress and went to the order. I used the cursor to point to the tracking number. I clicked copy and then opened FedEx.com. I logged into my account. Then I pasted the tracking number and showed the detailed tracking. I pointed to where it just said delivery to Minneapolis, MN. I then went to the advanced tracking option on the FedEx website. (You have to be signed in for this.) That shows me the dashboard with inbound shipments. I clicked one and was able to show that if the tracking number belonged to me it would actually show my name and address on the delivery event. The fake tracking number does not because it\u2019s not my package. \n\n6. If the seller uploads any kind of proof of delivery in the dispute and it doesn\u2019t show your name and address on it state that info in a reply to Aliexpress. Those kinds of things are easy to totally fake. It\u2019s also possible it\u2019s from a real item they shipped but it was for another customer and they erased that info to hide that fact. Honestly not sure how they would get ahold of a tracking number delivering to the same city unless they happened to have another order they could use to try to fake it for mine. Also entirely possible they are somehow hacking into something giving them access to FedEx tracking numbers. \n\n7. For the one where the delivery tracking showed the delivery photo I showed that and then pulled up my address in Google Maps and showed our house on street view to show the delivery photo is not my house. \n\n8. Remember how I said you can\u2019t enter more text after opening the dispute? I typed out explanations of what the photos and videos showed proving my case. I took screenshots of that and uploaded them as a photo along with the other photos and videos each time.\n\nHopefully these suggestions help you win your dispute. The more evidence you can upload the better chance of winning I believe. I think the fact that I bombarded Aliexpress with evidence whereas the seller could only say no it was delivered and maybe upload one faked proof of delivery worked in my favor.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say is before you order anything on there go to the store and read only the 1 star reviews. Had I done this I would never have ordered from them. Both were LITTERED with 1 star reviews all recent for the exact same issue. Item never delivered, tracking number doesn\u2019t belong to my address per FedEx/UPS, seller refuses to refund. Sadly seems like too many folks on there didn\u2019t win their dispute. \n\nI would also advise only using a credit card to order if you do decide to order from AliExpress. I used my debit card (Which was stupid of me as I know better.) Debit cards have far less protection in disputes than credit cards. \n\nSo hopefully this helps you!\n",
