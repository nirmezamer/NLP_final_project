I hope your internal wolves have settled their differences and are snuggled up in the den of your soul, warmed by the flickering fire of your happiness and peace. \n\nI'm sure we've all had quite an exciting week with both [Defunctland](https://youtu.be/Tc7uY5HqyWI?si=yWlvv7-UxaSMwGUi) and [Folding Ideas](https://youtu.be/b3gZOt1Lo4A?si=VMYUncd_KySd2aWS) dropping new videos, but what else did the algorithm put before you? What else had you mesmerized and distracted? \n\nDrop it all in the comments; inquiring minds want to know. \n\nLoose rules:\n1. Must have a link\n2. Must have a short description\n3. Must mention video length\n4. Keep it low threshold with individual videos, please. If you want to rep a whole channel or playlist, please do, but choose a favorite video to make it more accessible \n5. Max 1 rickroll per thread, so get in there quickly\n\nAs ever, last week's good  videos can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDCM8UQJyO2puzw9QGb2IJ238RQgmA4x7&si=Qcr-_XTfiQwhoR9I) and their descriptions  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hbomberguy/s/EFG8DEFTig).",

            "That sounds super interesting! Saving this to my watch later list.",
            "Todd in the Shadows dropped his long-awaited video examining the intriguing failure of Justin Timberlake's 2018 album [Man of the Woods](https://youtu.be/NLjTfXivoT0?feature=shared)",
            "This week I have a bit of an off the wall recommendation that I admittedly forgot about because of the theme week from when it came out, but I think it was really interesting. A furry YouTuber made a really in depth dive into their personal history with NASCAR, and their favorite driver, [Clint Bowyer](https://youtu.be/plwdbLojxJc?si=PlDXDDD2-MdEcvKV). (56:08) This video, more than any other Ive seen, captures the appeal of motorsports and particularly the parasocial relationship between fans and drivers.",
            "If you are like me and have to wade through MLB highlights to find any other type of videos in your feed, you might just really like this vid by Stark Raving Sports [about the times that fans intervened in sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inzENqdl4t4&t=1s), 19m:21s.\n\nIf you like indie games, Pixel a Day is here to tell you that [you might like/know about the wrong ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67V-GSaceFQ), 58m:20s. But actually, she makes really good points, talks to other cool peeps and keeps being one of the more interesting videogame essayists out there.",
            "The theme of my week seems to have been \"lessons from the 40s\".\n\nFor a light starter, the algorithm randomly served up [this piece of 1949 nostalgia](https://youtu.be/Ur3aS6KTL04?si=_InO9S6l4oNKNwNU) (9:54) with what is now officially my dream kitchen. Yes, the feminist in me died a little when I wrote that.\n\nThe main course was Matt Baum's [Cabaret & the Seductive Power of Evil](https://youtu.be/cPpwXUZNbNs?si=waw9sipPuq5knbYb) (52:53), with some juicy chunks of dread and a light jus of film and dance and Liza with a Z. Honestly, delightfully insightful and haunting at the same time. \n\nAnd for dessert I got Angela Colier on J.R.R \"I don't do allegory\" Tolkien and [The Scourge of the Shire](https://youtu.be/lKOGaAPDbdM?si=nSrVQNsHLgx4ulJJ) (55:13). She makes sure to point out he doesn't do allegory. Several times. And yet",
            "Jacob Gellers [Analyzing Every Torture Scene in Call of Duty  All 46 of Them](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiL3-CYzWk) (42:06) is a great analysis of the philosophy and morality of torture in the CoD franchise and how it often casually misrepresents how torture actually works.\n\nUnrealistically efficient and narratively justified depictions of torture that are far too common in media and have desensitized us to the topic, and this video is both a thorough look at CoD but also just contains a lot of important information about the subject in general.\n\nIt does feature lots of graphic video game cutscene violence and descriptions of torture though, so be warned.",
            "So a couple of videos about Australian LGBTQIA+ activists as I've been thinking about them for a bit:\n\n[This video](https://youtu.be/dV5be0fDnH4?si=A-5whvUh3JVWRTzV) {57m:12s} is a full episode of Monday Night Conference from the 70's and features the discussion between Australian Gay Liberation activist Lex Watson and the shows host, as well as members of the public in Mount Isa. There is some astounding homophobia in this video from some members of the public, but I think it's worth watching. Lex is a really important figure and it's worth seeing where and how things have changed and stayed the same from a primary source.\n\n[This video](https://youtu.be/b9zJsRBvzDs?si=JVQD0kuFqTTjl52B) {52m:32s} is technically a podcast but if features two intersex people, the host Blume and  guest Morgan Carpenter, discussing intersex rights. Morgan is also the designer of the Intersex flag, the purple circle on a yellow field, and I think how he talks about his choices in the design are really important. As someone trying to figure some stuff out wrt my body I really appreciate the discussion in the video. \n\nFor somthing completely different '[Louis Vuitton Sent A Private Investigator to My House](https://youtu.be/zDAg1aVnnH4?si=yswL7uOHIQDj788D)...' {11m:13s} from Corter Leather is about the experiance of this leather worker who has been legally repurposing leather handbags being accused of forgery, it's a wild story and has he tells it he makes a wallet out of an old LV bag which tickles me.\n\nAlso for some reason I've been recommended a bunch of ASMR wax seal videos , [like this one](https://youtu.be/59xYGdGEhjY?si=rleCF-8Fv76AtPPn) {16m:17s}. they're very relaxing and I enjoy the pretty colours melting.",
            "I haven't finished watching this one yet because my brain has been foggy, but [this incredible video](https://youtu.be/pv_iRpnhVIA?si=7OtunvaTFEe7INHs) (3:06:22) is about a straight woman who has dubbed herself \"The Arkansas AIDS Angel\" because of the community work she did in Arkansas during the AIDS crisis, Ruth Coker Burks. This was in the form of being with gay men who didn't have family as they died, and ensuring they got a proper burial. Unfortunately, decades later, she released a memoir that dehumanized the people she cared for and she began grifting off of her version of the story, which, according to the guy the creator spoke to us \"utter bullshit.\" She exaggerated how many people she helped and started a fundraiser to make a memorial for them ~~that still doesn't exist.~~\n \n(Correction: there is an angel statue, but it is unclear if Ruth put it there as she never claimed credit for it, and it's not a great memorial for the men. Regardless, the fundraiser money was likely, if not verifiably misappropriated)\n \nOphie Dokie researched this situation and compiled what are found into a 3 hour long video. She reached out to older gays who were in that community at the time Ruth was, and even helped to get a proper grave marker for two of the people who Ruth buried, the only two Ruth has mentioned with their full names and therefore the only two who we can confirm she was associated with (probably, I haven't finished the video so maybe there are more later).\n \nThis channel is criminally under watched and this video in particular is very important. Ruth's version of the story continues to spread, and even has an upcoming Broadway musical retelling it.\n \nEdited for the correction lol"
