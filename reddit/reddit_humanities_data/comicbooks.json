It also serves as a way to consolidate discussion to a single thread and talk about what books are popular here on /r/comicbooks. That does not mean other threads aren't welcome, this is just a place to start that's easy to find each week.\n\nThe thread is populated with comments meant to direct the discussion of each book. Based on a recent community decision we're expanding the Top Ten and populated the thread with titles appearing on Ten Percent or more of submitted pull lists. If a title you want to talk about is not listed, simply add a comment with the title and issue number first and comment below. There is also a comment dedicated to the discussion of WPL results linked above.\n\n**Spoilers will follow**, but there's no harm in tagging them as such.  Each title in the Top Ten listed below is linked directly to its corresponding comments to avoid seeing details from other books. The post has also been placed in \"contest mode\" to help readers avoid spoilers while browsing.\n\n**This Week's Most Pulled Titles:**\n\nBased on 75 submitted pull lists and 115 books shipping.\n\n1.
