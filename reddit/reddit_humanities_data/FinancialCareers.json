No clubs, or anything of that nature (during college.). I would like to work in finance and use my degree, but I just feel stuck now. During college I worked a retail job while in school ($10/hr.). Currently I work as a landscaper ($16/hr.). The job is straightforward but at times it can be hard on the body especially during the summertime (I am in Texas.). My coworkers are all great and all, most of them don\u2019t speak a lick of English (some just recently arrived to the U.S.). but I am bilingual and have no issue communicating. Usually, I am the one that is in charge since I speak English.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling down on myself. The fact that I graduated 2 years ago and still can\u2019t find a job in finance makes me feel bad about myself. I just feel like I should be making more money at this age. Been with the landscaping company for about 2 years now (started in June 2022). I did apply to jobs when I graduated and even before, but I would get no interviews for the most part. The ones I did I would just be ghosted or flat out told I would not be getting the job. Given the current job market it feels impossible to even get a job nowadays. Truth be told I stopped applying back in the spring of 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are nights where I can\u2019t sleep, nights where I feel like ending it all. You see people graduating and getting nice paying jobs and then there is me. \u00a0I just want to ask for some advice on here. What are my options? Should I just pursue a trade job instead? I keep up with the financial markets, keep up with what the Fed is doing, how the economy is doing, etc. I do have a passion for it but I just don't know what to do at the moment.\n\nThank you",

They were heavy into finance memes and would give the sort of advice i see on here. \n\nFast forward now and both of those guys are now working as \\*drumroll\\* tax preparers in those weird corner store tax stores surrounded by food markets and share an apartment with loads of other people. \n\nThey have both turned to bitter black pill people especially because the people in our year are now making VP or made the jump to the buyside and living well. \n\nNot saying being a tax preparer is bad but compared to what our coursemates went on to achieve its pretty bleak. \n\nHere is a list of things you should pay attention to:\n\n**1. If you didn't go to a good school AND have incredible grades AND great internships you are 100% wasting your time trying for IBD/HF/PE unless your family is incredibly connected:** Coming here to ask what your odds are is ridiculous imo because you will get people that will encourage you to keep trying when your energy should be spent trying to get employed. I have seen people here saying they regret not accepting the corp fin or some other job they got and now they are X years unemployed because they were waiting for IB/PE/HF.\n\n**2. Don't believe people that say Big 4 anything is a terrible look on your resume, I can bet you $1000 they are not in the industry and the only thing they know about finance is from The Wolf of Wall Street:** I have seen posts worried about accepting Big 4 offers and comments saying not to accept them because it will close doors. This one annoys me the most because I actually went from Big 4 to IBD and know many many people that did. You would be surprised the dregs of society that are on this sub giving this sort of advice. \n\n**3. The CFA is not useless:** This is another one I keep seeing, once again at my bank I have seen people make the move from commercial banking to IBD after taking the CFA and I work for a BB. I made the opposite jump from IBD to CB because someone left a seat open after moving to Lev Fin at my bank after passing the CFA. \n\n**4. Turning down any offer to try and hold on for an IB/PE/HF role makes you deserve career failure like those people from my college.** This is just reckless and stupid because even target students take less than desirable jobs for the stability. In this day and age turning down any full time employment is incredibly ridiculous and quite honestly i feel like you deserve whatever comes your way if you do this.\n\n**5. I don't care how toxic your work is don't quit without another one.** Enough said.\n\n**6. You SHOULD feel a sense of urgency to get your life together.** This is another really annoying one, i don't care how young you are, you do not have all the time in the world to find yourself, this isn't the 90s anymore. I have seen people post here saying they are panicking because they are about to graduate with no internship and no job and the comments would be filled with millennials saying they have all the time in the world to worry about that later. DO NOT LISTEN TO TO THESE PEOPLE. \n\n",

You generally need to be preparing for it when picking schools\n\nSo yeah I imagine it\u2019s more privileged to a degree but not surprisingly so",
            "From a UK perspective; yes. It has improved but it\u2019s systemically structured to favour those from privileged backgrounds.\n\nI realised this when I worked in a recruitment firm hiring for senior IB / PE roles. It\u2019s a strange situation where you get to see the thousands of flowing CVs, each containing candidates\u2019 educational backgrounds. people who ended up in these front-office finance roles were, disproportionately, in superior pre-university schooling (private, grammar, comprehensive schools in affluent areas). We were often paid for anonymised insights on this by large firms who were actively trying to improve their perceived \u2018diversity\u2019 and compare against the market.\n\nI remember having an assignment once from a well-known growth equity firm who wanted an Investment Associate, caveated with being state-educated. One of the hardest assignments I\u2019ve ever worked on, there were so few.\n\nSomeone has reasonably stated reasons as to why this is the case and I completely agree. To land a successful, high-paying finance role you not only have to have the intellect and drive (lots of people have this), you need to be aware of the narrow pathway that will lead you there [Target school, competitive course, spring week, internship, full-time role]. Coming from a privileged environment would make you more likely to be aware of this pathway at the right time.\n\nOther forms of finance like quant finance/ HFT place more emphasis on pure brainpower and you can often forego internships etc. by being exceptionally clever, and exceptionally clever on paper.",

Now, here's the catch.. the median yearly salary in my country (Pakistan) is  around 3k USD. So, yes. High finance in my country is for privileged people only. Because, they got connections, money and opportunities to enter the field..which the middle class can't afford.\n\nIt's sad.. but that's how it is.\n\nEdit: I will not be able to attend the school because i simply cannot afford it. And my pay is considered to be on 'higher' side in my country. Six figures in our currency but merely $400.",

Privileged kids go to the top (private) schools, they have tutors, resources for extracurriculars, SAT prep, etc. Their schools are feeders to the top universities that are \u201ctargets\u201d for ib recruiting. They won\u2019t have to work while in school to pay for living expenses. They can do unpaid internships and fully focus on their career. At the end of the day privileged kids are just much more likely to have the opportunities.\n\nEveryone I\u2019ve met on the sell side definitely comes from an upper middle class background at least.\n\nIf you\u2019re not privileged you\u2019re not excluded but you\u2019re much less likely to be there.\n\n\nAlso only wealthy people can afford to not work for a few years to attend a top MBA program to try to re-recruit.",
