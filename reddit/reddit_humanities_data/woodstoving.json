The one for sale needs new bricks. I have been searching online and can\u2019t figure out where I can buy them (shipping to Canada). \n2. I would be installing in a Roughneck 4 season trailer not house. I understand these stoves are HEAVY. Would a trailer be able to handle the weight?  I don\u2019t drive it around. It is stationary. \n3. I understand coal burns a lot hotter. Does this mean I need specialty piping and other install parts?\n4. All the diagrams I see assume a sloped roof. Is this required for this stove for some reason?\n5. Anything else I should be thinking of?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "Thanks you!!! This is very helpful information. So it sounds like this stove is likely not useful for my use case. How do I find an appropriate one?  I keep coming across the cubic minis but I know someone using one for the same use case and it is just too small to heat the space or last that long.",
            "Combustion air. The use of indoor oxygen requires outside air intake for your installation.\n\nThis is why appliances are UL Listed for use. Such as residential, RV, commercial, marine\u2026. You are using an appliance not made for, tested, or Listed for this use. An appliance safe for your use would require less clearance to install in a smaller space, and have outdoor air supply. \u201cListed\u201d for mobile home or factory built housing is not RV. \n\nCoal itself burns hotter, but less of it is in the firebox than wood.\n\nThe chimney and venting system runs much cooler using coal. About half the temperature of wood.\n\nThis is because water vapor from the combustion of hydrogen in the fuel condenses in the venting system below 250*f. This allows smoke particles to stick forming flammable creosote in the venting system. So the venting system burning wood needs to remain above this critical temperature when smoke is present. 250*f all the way to the top, hence insulated chimney.\n\nCoal has no particles to form creosote, so the heat can be used inside the structure instead of needed to be left up chimney.\n\nChimney pipe is tested at 1000*f constant operating temperature which it can see with wood. The chimney also must withstand 3 creosote fueled chimney fired at 2100*f each for 10 minutes duration.\n\nWithout forming creosote, coal chimneys were built with lower temperatures requirements. Factory built chimney today is Class A - all fuel, using the same for both solid fuels. Installation instructions that come with chimney must be followed exactly to install *as tested.*\n\nThis is why a barometric damper is used with coal that mixes indoor air with the hot gases rising up chimney to cool them, precisely controlling draft (the hot rising exhaust gases creates a low pressure area in chimney, allowing atmospheric air pressure to PUSH air into the stove intake feeding fire) This low pressure in chimney, or vacuum is measured as draft.\n\nYou can see how critical it is to have atmospheric air pressure available to the firebox air intake, which smaller areas called *confined spaces* do not allow. This is why solid fuel burning appliances are not allowed in sleeping areas.\n\nOut the wall instead of flat roof prevents water leaks for your type roof."

            "Couple things. The 8\u201d flue they said looks like an 8x8 fireclay tile which is 6.5x6.5 ish inside dimensions. Your biggest issue is the thimble(wall penetration) is too close to the combustible framing and the wall. Even with double wall connector from the stove to chimney u need 6\u201d from combustible surfaces. The thimble area can be replaced with a combustible wall thimble and section of 6\u201d class a pipe but it\u2019s still going to be too close to the wall. What idiot designed that location???",
