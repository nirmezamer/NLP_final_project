            "Nearly zero chance any modern or efficient wood stove is rated to use a flue pipe diameter different from the outlet diameter, and that it could be used in an uninsulated flue that is a massive heat sink (stoves pretty much require Class A flue piping once it leaves the room, some allow for an insulated lined of the correct diameter)\n\n\nA 6\" to 8\" flue pipe diameter change would see nearly a doubling in cross sectional area, that itself would cause flue gasses to expand rapidly, cool & lose a ton of velocity. The thermal mass of a masonry chimney would also radically cool the flue gasses, and it not being near as well sealed as Class A flue piping that all adds up to a house fire danger & a threat to everyone who lives there from Carbon Monoxide poisoning.\n\n\nManufacturer installation instructions trumps nearly everything, most likely what you have falls outside of acceptable and should not be done like that, should run new correct diameter Class A insulated double wall flue pipe made for hot wood fires.",
            "There are reducers so it\u2019s not an issue.\n\n8\u201d is usually the larger stoves and 6\u201d is the smaller ones..just depends on what you\u2019re looking for in a stove and how much sqf you\u2019re going to heat",

But as long as it\u2019s swept out and kept clean..I don\u2019t see why there would be..\n\nI have mine going straight up through the attic with a 22` angle pipe, otherwise is would go through the crown of my roof. I sweep mine out 2-3 times a year depending on how much I burn and if how much it\u2019s seasoned."

The one for sale needs new bricks. I have been searching online and can\u2019t figure out where I can buy them (shipping to Canada). \n2. I would be installing in a Roughneck 4 season trailer not house. I understand these stoves are HEAVY. Would a trailer be able to handle the weight?  I don\u2019t drive it around. It is stationary. \n3. I understand coal burns a lot hotter. Does this mean I need specialty piping and other install parts?\n4. All the diagrams I see assume a sloped roof. Is this required for this stove for some reason?\n5. Anything else I should be thinking of?  \n\nThanks in advance!",
