            "I havnt watched past like the first 10 episodes but from what ive heard there will never be a kill like this again cause everyones too op for traps and can only be taken down by outpowering them, which is basically just dragon ball lol",
            "Shikamaru is a quiet and levelheaded character, still the way he killed Hidan was one of the most cruel we saw in the manga/anime. Gotta love him.",

            "Could\u2019ve gone back to the basics, could\u2019ve gone back to battles being about techniques and strategies\u2026 but we got the infinity warfare treatment with a splash of Hot Topic.",
            "I sat through do much boruto waiting for it to be good but my God it just didn't happen. It sucks because Naruto more than dragon ball was the anime I really grew up with and I was excited for more of that universe but I'm just disappointed",
            "It was already like that in the 4th war , hell hidan is probably the weakest Akatsuki member since he can't use ninjutsu or genjutsu , try to do this to deidara and you'll just explode with him. Try to do this with itachi and you'll just be caught on a tsukuyomi."
