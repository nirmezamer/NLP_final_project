            "I sat through do much boruto waiting for it to be good but my God it just didn't happen. It sucks because Naruto more than dragon ball was the anime I really grew up with and I was excited for more of that universe but I'm just disappointed",
            "It was already like that in the 4th war , hell hidan is probably the weakest Akatsuki member since he can't use ninjutsu or genjutsu , try to do this to deidara and you'll just explode with him. Try to do this with itachi and you'll just be caught on a tsukuyomi."
