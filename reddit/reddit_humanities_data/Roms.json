If you feel something is missing there PM SuperBio and he'll have it added. \n\n* The next 5 tabs link directly to collections based on console and publisher, they include Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Sega, and the PC. \n\n* The last tab is the other tab, this is where you can find Retro games, defined by No-Intro and others as pre Gamecube and PS2 era. This tab exists to link to the large collections that No-Intro and various other groups have collected.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**/r/ROMS Official Matrix server [Link](https://matrix.to/#/#romz:matrix.org)**\n\n* Go here if you need additional help with anything ROM or emulation related.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n     \n\n**Changelog:** \n\nRedid Megathread post on Reddit, hopefully this is a cleaner, easier to read version that isn't as confusing as the out of date changelog\n\nMoved the megathread to gitlab due to account issues on github, update your bookmarks accordingly.\n\nRestored the megathread on github, left the gitlab megathread link as a backup, both will be updated.",

It'll then place a file on your desktop called \"archiveorglinks.txt\" with all of the links of the ROM's, that you can then either go through and either pick out ones you want or select all of them and then load into \"Free Download Manager\" to handle the downloads for you. You get faster downloads this way and can leave it alone while it does its thing.

            "Hello!\n\nI've been planning to buy a RG35XXH because I've been wanting to get back into emulation since buying the RG350. I bought one that had preloaded roms, and I found myself spending more time going through the menus trying to find a game rather than actually playing anything so I was wondering if there were any recommendations for roms or rom packs that are kind of \"samplers\" when it comes to games. I'm not really looking for complete collections of handhelds or systems but maybe a handful of games in different genres for each system that the RG35XXH can play. I'm not quite sure what games I am into but I am open to trying a bunch of different types.\n\nThanks in advance!"
