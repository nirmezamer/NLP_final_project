This tab exists to link to the large collections that No-Intro and various other groups have collected.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**/r/ROMS Official Matrix server [Link](https://matrix.to/#/#romz:matrix.org)**\n\n* Go here if you need additional help with anything ROM or emulation related.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n     \n\n**Changelog:** \n\nRedid Megathread post on Reddit, hopefully this is a cleaner, easier to read version that isn't as confusing as the out of date changelog\n\nMoved the megathread to gitlab due to account issues on github, update your bookmarks accordingly.\n\nRestored the megathread on github, left the gitlab megathread link as a backup, both will be updated.",

I even saw that there was a cord you could use for bigger flash drives, cause the 128GB takes more power. I got that and still nothing. Can someone please help me figure this out?"

        "content": "Hello, so,\n\nI've been dreaming about playing that game called Mission V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire, made by mindscapes and published on the Nintendo DS alongside two other versions on personal computers (one pet veterinary and one farm animals), ever since before i even OWNED a DS (so before 2015)\n\nas a young kid i would watch HOURS of those rare few YouTube videos i could find about the game on loop, all day everyday. i ended up never getting that game (never found it even in retro stores irl) and kind of forgot about it, until tonight, where it just.. appeared in my brain again.\n\nI've made researches, first i looked through emulation and rom hosting websites, venn(?)'s lair, romstation, every \"main\" site i usually found all my stuff on, nothing showed up. i resorted to looking into the web archive, since the DS is an old console i knew that people before me must've At LEAST though about archiving all the games on the system, and out of the millions of minds that though about it at least ONE person must've done it.. right.?\nand i was right. i found MANY archives supposedly \"containing all ds games\" ever released in every region.... but not mission v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire. that game was impossible to find online.\n\nafter a bit i stumbled upon this sub, and people kept yelling REALLY rudely at new commers to read that mega thread thing (which btw left a bad first impression of the community simply by witnessing it lmao don't do that shi) so i though I'd take a look..\n\nnot only was it an absolute N I G H T M A R E to navigate, the archive everyone yelled about that i ended up miraculously finding after 15minutes of not understanding wtf was going on on that website DID NOT CONTAIN THE GAME\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\n\nso i'm really lost. i don't know what to do. I've checked at least 10 trusted and relatively complete rom websites and like 5 \"all games in existence\" archives and i have no luck finding a single .nds file of that game.\n\ni know there are a few people selling it for dirt cheap on ebay n stuff, unfortunately even if it was sold for a cent i still wouldn't be able to purchase it to archive it myself because i am a minor (no credit card or paypal) so i have no way to oay online. it's a huge pain in the ass to know I'm 4 euros away from getting my hands on my childhood dream, it hurts even more that it doesnt even exist online.\n\n\n>>>>>> \n\n**TLDR: does anyone has the game Mission V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire (NDS) that they could dump and send me, or do any of y'all have a link to an archive containing it that i would have somehow missed..? please, and thank you!**\n\n(photos are just screenshots of the game being non existent on previously checked websites.)",
