He loved spending time with my siblings and mom. My dad died suddenly during our time together and he stepped up. However we were still only 4 months into dating. It was a lot I guess for a new relationship. He started saying things like he loves me and sees ne around forever. He initiated the conversations about the future and kids. And then after a boys trip to Mexico he came back and was super distant. He began acting like my presence irritated him. I felt a pulling away and asked. With some\nGentle coaxing he finally confessed he\u2019s no longer sure about me and is worried about wasting everyone\u2019s time. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what his concerns are but just asked for more time and to take things slow. In the moment I agreed and thought this was reasonable but the more time passed the more I realized I was pissed off at this man for winning me over with the notion of marriage and then just switching up. \n\nIt really hurt me and I hence I ended up in a messy break up. I still love this man but I just see an anxious avoidant trap playing out.\nHe didn\u2019t seem to want to work on things. He\u2019s rather pretend there\u2019s a happier more positive option for him out there and I refuse to chase. I know my ego is getting in the way but my anxiety was peak high towards the end with this guy. He made me lose a lot of the little self esteem I had to begin with. I miss having him in my life but also hate that he didn\u2019t accept\nMe for me and if anything rejected me once he got to know the real me. \n\nAny advice on how to move forward? My entire vacation in Italy has been moping about this man who has now ghosted me for over two months. \n\nAddendum: I forgot to mention, he told me he\u2019s been unsure for 9 months. That\u2019s half our relationship. This coincides with the time we went to a fitness event as a group and he placed both his hands on my sister and another girl\u2019s butts to help then with an obstacle. He paid for our hotel and drove us to the event but I couldn\u2019t get past the weirdness of this gesture especially since he seemed to be withholding physical touch from me at this point. I raised my concern with him and he seemed devastated that this was my takeaway. I understand how he might\u2019ve been hurt but I also couldn\u2019t overlook this issue. Iunno maybe I was immature and insecure. This seems to be the genesis of our downfall\u2026lol ",

It's not easy to get over someone you loved but time marches on and you go through the stages of grief as they come but keep moving forward regardless. \n\nYou're in Italy?! Honey Jesus H. Christ! Go out there and have fun! Go do stupid tourist stuff, pick a random restaurant to visit, go enjoy your life. Put your phone down, go and actually actively participate in your life instead of looking over your shoulder.",
            "You aren't an idiot at all, dear! It is so hurtful when you open up to a person, feel loved and safe and suddenly everything changes without warning or reason. I can only tell you from experience that time will make everything better. You may even get an unterstanding why he acted like an asshole. However you are right not to chase him and it is not a case of \"ego getting in the way\" but  necessary to keep up self respect and self care. Don't take blame or feel he rejected the real you. Very often it doesn't have anything to do with you at all! Take time to heal, maybe get therapy. And try to live in the moment and not in the past. Italy is far to beautiful to waste the experience on a man.",

His becoming distant could be the result of guilt or it could be the result of him realising that what he feels with you isn't what he thought it was - I do not know him at all so I cannot really say for sure.",

            "Sounds like he manipulated you from the beginning.  Any promises of marriage less than 1.5 years in a relationship should send red flags in the future.  Marriage is a mutual agreement something discussed at the right time",
