Perpetrators who target adults could face up to two years in prison, while those who target children could face three years.\"",
            "In Australia a man has just been sentenced to 9 1/2 years jail for a similar offence. \u00a0This is the type of sentence that is needed.\u00a0",

Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law. \n\n[Citizen's Guide To U.S. Federal Law On Child Pornography](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography)\n\nSomebody is trying very hard to scare people into believing that no laws cover AI, when they do. The law already makes it illegal to circulate images of a child, even if those images were fake, and the penalty is the same as if they were real. If prosecutors are refusing to do their jobs, that is a whole different problem.\n\nJust to be clear, this law would mean fake images would get more jail time than actual images, which makes no sense at all. The reason Ted Cruz is on board, is this is a way of going after social media, and removing LGBTQ from society, because Right-Wing Republicans like Cruz continue to say LGBT images are child porn or grooming children. This legislation is a Trojan Horse to undermine rights, while pretending to help women.",

            "This should count as child pornography",
            "Deep fakes regardless of how innocent should result in fines or jailable offenses. So pictures, videos, audio, etc... It's all fraud.",
