Please use r/legitcheck\n\nIf r/legitcheck is a total nightmare of a sub with no moderation and no quality engagement then I'm sorry and I can offer you this. If you create a legit check sub I will promote the hell out of it here. I'll put a pinned post up announcing it's creation and I'll leave it up for a bit\n.  I'll post it on every legit check post before I delete it. I'll even help moderate it. I'll clear the mod queue for a bit. I'm all in.\n\nThe people have spoken and I've always ran this sub like a proper democracy. Legit check posts aren't welcome by the majority so please don't post them. I never banned someone for a legit check post but I might after this post has been up for a while. Please stop.\n\nUse r/legitcheck. If that sub blows then pm me if you wanna make a good sub for legit checks and I'll help get the word out.\n\nI've been here for a minute. I'm trying my best. We have other mods that are trying their best. We want to help.\n\nOK. Bye for now.",

            "People are just going to just flood the brand specific subs. The majority of posts in r/nike are not only sneaker legit checks but also apparel. It sucks.",
            "But why would people offer this for free. If they like legit checking so much they could work for one of the hundred stupid legit checking apps :D",
            "Got em posts and slept on posts are both removed if/when they hit the mod queue",
            "Not disagreeing but you also have to keep in mind a lot of this stems from resale value, when you buy luxury goods you assume you\u2019ll be able to get some percentage of money back if you sell, and you don\u2019t get this with reps.\n\nSo if you\u2019re already paying hundreds over the MSRP you\u2019re gonna wanna be doubly sure that you are spending it on an item that will hold some of that value.\n\nHighly doubt LC would be as much of a thing as it is if Nike drops were widely available for retail price and no one was buying the ridiculous second-hand market.",
