Lot of ppl out there having to talk to fraud companies today and having cards bricked because they tried to handle a release by themselves and didn\u2019t want to break off Shopify or PayPal anything. Joke of a company.",

I thought my payment was declining because of an address change due to moving but it finally went through. Just in time for them to shut the site down and move the drop to tomorrow. Hopefully my order sticks and they don't cancel it.",

Please use r/legitcheck\n\nIf r/legitcheck is a total nightmare of a sub with no moderation and no quality engagement then I'm sorry and I can offer you this. If you create a legit check sub I will promote the hell out of it here. I'll put a pinned post up announcing it's creation and I'll leave it up for a bit\n.  I'll post it on every legit check post before I delete it. I'll even help moderate it. I'll clear the mod queue for a bit. I'm all in.\n\nThe people have spoken and I've always ran this sub like a proper democracy. Legit check posts aren't welcome by the majority so please don't post them. I never banned someone for a legit check post but I might after this post has been up for a while. Please stop.\n\nUse r/legitcheck. If that sub blows then pm me if you wanna make a good sub for legit checks and I'll help get the word out.\n\nI've been here for a minute. I'm trying my best. We have other mods that are trying their best. We want to help.\n\nOK. Bye for now.",
