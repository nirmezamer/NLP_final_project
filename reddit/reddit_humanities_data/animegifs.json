            "Better animation than most modern media",
            "This is super cool, but I just realized it wouldn't happen. The round would just fall down the empty handle onto the ground. The only reason it would otherwise eject like that would be the next round springing up from the magazine to replace it. No mag, no eject.\n\nEdit: Nope I'm wrong. It you pull the slide back fast enough the ejector will cause the round to fly out.  I'm just the idiot who hasn't been to the range in years trying to speak confident on the internet haha.",
            "This satisfies my love of guns and anime.",
            "Yeah, back when Japan was on course to becoming a global superpower",
            "You're half incorrect, half correct. If you pull the slide back slowly sure that'll actually happen as you described sometimes depending on the angle in which you do it or how slowly you do it. When you pull the slide back with force the extractor will toss it out. \n\nSource: Shooting 200-500rds of 9mm a week for the last 3 years. Other source, any actual footage of someone shooting handguns or rifles for competition or combat/law enforcement scenarios.",
            "ok Im not going to go check out the anime now",
            "Yep, you know I think you're right. I don't shoot all too often, and every time I remember clearing the chamber, the round has just fallen out the bottom. But I never do this very quickly. I feel dumb, I'm going to give this a try. I'm still thinking that the rounds in the magazine have something to do with the trajectory of the ejected round.",
            "Maybe your extractor is worn out or has a burr on it?",
            "{{**Spriggan**}}",
            "This would still occur, a little lever (extractor) on the slide grips the casing rim of the bullet and pulls it back, the other side of the casing hits a block inside (ejector) causing tension until the block overcomes the arm and forces the bullet out in the opposing direction of the ejector, the faster the slide is racked, the more force will be applied to the bullet, if the slide was pulled very slowly it might be possible to drop it through the magazine well.
