            "Have you tried to discuss with him your issues with how he is choosing to play them game? Does he realize that he is causing problems and doesn't care about other peoples' fun, or is he oblivious to how his choices are effecting others? And why is it that kicking him from the table isn't an option, because that makes it seem like he has a lot of emotional leverage on you for some reason.",
            "Gaming at the table involves compromise. And it sounds like the rest of the party is bending over backward to accommodate his nonsense (willingly or unwillingly) to keep with the social contract, but he is not compromising or making any accommodation for what the rest of the party thinks or wants. And he needs to.\n\nI hate to suggest potentially antagonistic behavior, but if he's not going to bend and he can't go, then there needs to be a mechanism to prevent him from tanking the campaign. And that might have to be a veto process somewhere in the system.",
            "I'll try to pull the party in more on these decisions. This particular instance was a deal made with an NPC and he intentionally did it on the sly so other party members wouldn't notice, as in literally talked to me in the other room and he was talking to the NPC while players were doing other things, so their characters likely wouldn't have noticed anyway but I think for the sake of fairness I can do something to bring them into the decision-making process even against the behest of the problem player.\n\nThis is a good example of his interparty conflict that I think is at a detriment to the game. I can tell it doesn't sit well with the other players and when brought up to him in character, he basically says, the party can do what they want, but he's made the decision his character would make and the party can follow him if they choose. To me it seems like a manipulation tactic against the party, the vibe in the room that I inferred was he has made a decision and the consequences fall on them should they choose to go the other way and split the party. He would take responsibility for it if he were to be put on the spot, but he seems to capitalize on the unlikelihood of a serious call out and really shifts the pressure of the decision onto the players even though he basically took away their agency in the decision.",
            "We've had a talk before and he was receptive enough during the conversation, I haven't come outright and said that it's interfering with my fun, which I may bring up after the next session if it continues to be an issue. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if he's oblivious or not. I think he sees himself as a \"wiLD cARd\" not unlike Charlie in that episode of It's Always Sunny. If you're not familiar, basically chaotic neutral for the sake of it and he chose his character goals and those are his character's goals. \n\nAs for kicking him, it's a fairly tight group of friends who have been playing together for 2 or 3 years now. Prior to this, I've played games with him on and off for about a decade. He's part of the group and while D&D is what we are there for, we are also there to see and hang out with each other. This behavior is only at the game table and otherwise he's a fun to hang out with, good dude.",
            "Perhaps... I'll try to think of a viable in game reason to make veto's work. I may also try to reorientate his goals, as they are supposed to be a heroic group whose primary motivation is, without going into specifics, to defeat the evil power. He's opting to work for himself rather than the goal of the party and if that's the case, it might be necessary to reroll a character to fit the world. He can have his own motivations beyond \"fight the bad guys,\" but they shouldn't supersede it, and the players in the party would appreciate a game with a little more compromise on his part.",
            "Don\u2019t allow him to pull you into another room. Even if he is on his own have the discussion with the npc at the table.",
            "Ordinarily I would suggest he create a new character (after all, why would the other characters have a valid narrative reason for hanging around with this kind of person? He should create someone that they *would* want to hang around) but since you indicated that it's been a problem in other campaigns, that points to a pattern. It suggest to me that he'll simply create another, similar character with antisocial tendencies. So then the veto will end up moving from his behavior to the whole character creation process, and he'll almost certainly be passive aggressive about that.",
            "That's the move. My frustration is that I need to basically be on guard against the guy the whole time. Which I feel puts us on antagonistic footing and that's not how I want to DM; for me it's not a fun way to play. The other thing is, I can trust the other characters to put the party first, or on low chance they are acting selfishly as a character, they are still playing for broader fun of more players than just themselves. He's the only one I have to be this way with."

            "What's a good way to characterize demons and make them an active force in the world? From my understanding, devils are easy to work with conceptually: making deals, trying to make their way to the top, and ultimately following rules. Someone might want to take over a country by opening a portal for an army of devils from the hells. \n\nFrom how I understand demons though, they're a lot more \"lol, I'm evil,\" so I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around making ones with their own personality. Plus, I can't see demons interacting with the material plane as much as devils, since devils are much easier to work with as a mortal, and might provide incentives for letting them breach into the material plane.",

            "Apologies in advance for the wall of text...TLDR at bottom\n\nHey all, looking for some help for my son. He's age 6 and autistic but not profoundly so, in other words he's fully verbal, can communicate well and understand you. He's very clever and has an extremely vivid imagination. But he has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions, reading emotions and emotional cues in others and is subject to fits of rage. It's been really tough on the family trying to find ways to limit these and esnure they don't result in violence against others.\n\nIn my youth I played a lot of tabletop D&D but haven't played it in many years, (I never was a DM just a regular player). But I've kept up with the genre via video games (most recently Baldur's Gate III). My son loves watching me play BG3 but it gets tricky because its not age appropriate most of the time. Also, those aforementioned fits of rage are often triggered by the cessation of a beloved activity like watching TV shows or video games. So I'm trying to find an outlet for him that will not lead to emotional meltdowns but that engages his imagination and creativity and allows him to explore RPG style adventures with me.\n\nI've never DMd before but am willing to try, I found this package called [Little But Fierce](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/395165/Little-but-Fierce-Starter-Edition) which just takes 5e rules and simplifies them for young kids so I was going to start with that (e.g. you can't be 'killed' only 'injured/knocked out'). Also heard good things about Lost Mine of Phandelver as well so that might be a good candidate for the next campaign. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for any general good advice, especially if you've run a campaign with young kids before but I did think of some specific questions as well:\n\n1)Gear - what do I need as a DM? I have tons of dice, I have one of those dry erase map kits for drawing the dungeon. I have the Little But Fierce story campaign (which includes character sheets)? Monster Manual I assume?\n\n2)He's very visual so I was thinking visual cues would be really helpful, like for example the Monster Manual he'll really enjoy, also was thinking of a visual of his character on his sheet.\n\n3)Have you any experience with the digital versions (D&D Beyond)? Was looking at their stuff and lots of options there. But thought maybe start with the monster manual that I could have up on a laptop next to our game board to show them what they are fighting?\n\nmuch thanks, I really appreciate it.\n\nTLDR - son is 6 yrs old and autistic, looking for suggestions on campaigns, gameplay, DM advice etc",

Kobold fight club says it's very deadly, but I've been told not to listen to that too much. If it does sound like too much can you suggest a way to tone it down without cutting the number of enemies much? I was thinking to have the dread rats only make one attack each as a start. Or maybe there's a better profile to use than that one?\n\n7 Giant rats\n\n5 Dread rats (https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Dread\\_Rat\\_(5e\\_Creature))\n\n1 rat catcher (Not sure what profile to use, maybe a mage who only casts poison spray?)",

            "Generally when I've played it we focus very little on any sex. Sex sometimes happens but it's always fade to black, no further details on that beyond I grab her hand and lead her upstairs or the equivalent. But we might have some flirting, or other romantic scenes. There is an element of weirdness, but you do get used to that after a little while. Honestly I think I've gotten to the point where I'm more comfortable flirting with my friends as an NPC than I am with real people which is its own problem! It is also interesting to step across gender lines when having those scenes as well. I (a cis straight man) have played as the NPC in a number of lesbian couples now, as well as a few with two guys. It's also interesting as long with everyone is comfortable and cool with it to be at a table with a couple and one of them decides to start flirting with someone. That can be funny to be a guy flirting with another guy as I am sitting next to his wife who is trying not to laugh. \n\nBut you can have some great roleplaying moments that come from relationships and the elements that can add to a game. Those have been some of my favorite NPCs and a lot of great moments over the years. Both for funny moments and really serious and dramatic moments. I've had a few weddings that have been interesting to play out too and decide that element of my worldbuilding and work with the player on what they want to do for that.",

I make liberal use of \"rule of cool\".\n\nFor reference to paint the situation, my group (3 people, rogue, druid, ranger) was at the end of a dungeon, 2nd level, had just killed the necromancer boss and were finishing with cleaning up the skeleton minions in the cave. Rogue had been having a bad night with rolls in general, goes down to a skeleton near the end of the fight when there's only two left. Ranger hasn't missed an attack roll yet this session, but takes a critical hit from a skeleton that puts him down to 4 hit points. The Druid, who had been separated from the group for a while fighting the necromancer, returns to see their friends all dying or unconscious, and drops a skeleton while drawing the aggro of the second. \n\nNow, the druid already had very low health after fighting the necromancer, four hit points to be exact. The skeleton beats his armor class and rolls an 8 on the damage roll, which would be more than enough to also knock him unconscious. Despite the ranger being wounded, I think he probably could have dispatched the final skeleton on his own, but for some reason in the moment I decided it might be cooler to have the druid go down to 1 HP, and keep the group on edge thinking he died when he pulls himself back up to fight.\n\nIt didn't seem too bad to me in the moment, the whole group was excited, and after this the Druid even rolled a nat 20 which led to the last two of them dispatching the final monster. The druid feels like a badass for surviving a huge sword wound and the party is extremely excited about escaping death just barely, everyone seems happy. I probably shouldn't worry about it too much but it keeps rattling around in my head.\n\nFor additional reference, my players are very new (like, 1st-2nd time playing DND new) and I want to give them moments that make them feel cool without them feeling like \"we only lived because the DM let us\".

The dice don't dictate what happens, but they do help to facilitate the story you're telling because it's the structure of how the game is played, obviously. If you want the players to have an epic, hardwon victory, you have every right to fudge the dice and let that happen. Honestly, I wish I followed my own advice more. I've TPK'd my players twice and it was due to strict adherence to the dice. LMOP and I rolled max goblins for a random encounter, and they had surprise. Wiped the party in two turns. It's not that fun, especially at early levels.",

So no healing for the PC. Her going unconscious basically means a death unless she rolls a Nat 20. I haven't brought in a spellcaster sidekick for heals because I don't want too many NPC sidekicks making up the party. I might homebrew the warrior sidekick into a paladin instead of a fighter. At least swap second wind for lay on hands. But she's level 3 now, so the fudged rolls have slowed down. Levels 1 and 2 definitely had some fights that would have been anticlimactic deaths.

They had returned (once again) to the city which was the starting point and the centerpiece of our campaign. Hence, they know many locations, NPCs there and had made many friends and enemies. As our last session ended shortly after their return I decided to not plan for anything for our next session and instead ask the players what they would like to do in the city. Two of them only expressed the desire to follow a plot conflict I had brought up last session (there is no urgency tied to it though). The third player, however, came up with several of his own ideas which gave me a lot of material to work with.!<\n\n>!At first I was a bit disappointed by the lack of ideas from the two players but then I started thinking back about the whole campaign and realised that it had always been like this. Two were reactive and the third was proactive but because there had always been a lot for them to react to, it never was an issue.!<\n\n***The point of the post:***\n\nI want to say that both styles of play are great for DnD. However, both of them can be problematic if you have only one type of players.\n\n**If your party consists solely of reactive players**\u00a0then you might eventually feel a lot of pressure and responsibility for carrying the story forward and if you run out of plot hooks and ideas mid-session then you might find your players staring at you and waiting for another call for adventure.\u00a0*You will have to be proactive all the time and that is not easy for a DM.*\n\n**If your party only has proactive players**\u00a0then you might struggle to keep up with their decisions, struggle to have them follow your main plot hook and you will find yourself improvising and creating new locations and NPCs out of the blue all the time.\u00a0*Being reactive all the time can be extremelly stressful and draining for a DM.*\n\n**If you are a player**, maybe think about how you approach the game and whether you can make the life of your DM a bit easier once in a while. If you are very proactive, then consider just following the plot hook your DM presented and let him lead a more linear story for once before you streer the campaign elsewhere with your own ideas once more. If you are mostly only reactive, then try to come up with a plot (or an idea) of your own and bring it up in your next session. Seeing you unexpectedly taking matters into your hands will likely cheer your DM up and make him certain you really do care about his campaign.\n\n**If you are a DM**\u00a0and you feel like you are having issues with your party's reactivity or proactivity, don't hesitate to bring it up. If you feel like they are only reactive, then tell them that you would love to build the campaign also around their own ideas, let them know they can take an initiative if they feel like it. If you feel like they smother you with neverending proactivity, then maybe suggest they give you a heads up in between sessions so that you can better prepare for whatever they wish to follow. You need to have fun as well and constant improvising may be fun for every DM.\n\n**If you are a player and you feel like your DM will not let you be proactive**\u00a0then don't hold back and bring it up. You should be forming your story and campaign together and you should always have a chance to affect the world with your own ideas.\n\n**PS1:**\u00a0I don't have an advice for DMs who are purely reactive because I can't imagine such campaigns would last long unless you have an extremelly proactive players! (it would be cool to see such a campaign though)\n\n**PS2:**\u00a0For the sake of this post, I disregarded the existence of passive players who neither initiate actions nor react to the presented ones. I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD (or at least that it ruins fun for others unless previously agreed upon).\n\n**PS3:**\u00a0Obviously I know that most players will encompass both styles of play to some extend so I just simplified it for this post (the two \"reactive\" players of mine also had moments of proactivity which caught me off guard a few times).\n\n**Tldr:**\u00a0Both reactive and proactive styles of play are great but can be problematic if one exists without the other at your table. Whether you are a player or a DM, try to reflect on your own reactivity and proactivity and consider whether it might be causing issues at your table. If you feel like someone else's level of activity is causing issues, then don't hesitate and bring it up before it's too late.",

            "I get what you're saying but this post sounds awful prescriptive.\n\nI enjoy doing a small amount of setup and reacting to my player's choices (situation-based play). My players however are quite passive, so I tend to shoulder moving the plot a bit more than maybe I would like. **But, that's just how it is.** Due to multiple different factors you will never have a perfect group.\n\nInstead, it's about deciding on the style of game **everyone at the table wants to play.** My table never even brings up the idea of a sandbox game because I don't want to run it and my players wouldn't enjoy it. Over time we have figured out that an episodic style of mini-arcs makes it easy for my players to have clear goals but also lets me prep 2-3 session-long situations that they are comfortable reacting to, rather than a campaign-wide situation-based playstyle.\n\nTL;DR Don't tell people how to play. Discuss with your players what playstyle/game would work best for your table.",
            "I think that the point that you are missing is that this is just a hobby, that you can't change people, and that if people have to make a lot of effort to change who they are to play, then even assuming that you can find a fit, it's not going to last very long because people will generally fall back into their usual patterns.\n\nIn addition the part that I dislike is \"I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD.\" Sorry but no, once more, it's a hobby, played amongst friends, and even if some people are generally passive, it does not mean that they don't have a place at the table, and that they don't contribute on some other levels and enjoy the game just by being there with their friends, maybe infrequently.\n\nIn the end,  and beyond the proactivity/passivity of players, it's the general agreement about the style of play that matters. Proactive players might be more comfortable in a sandbox-style campaign, reactive players more comfortable in a story-arc campaign, but the main point is that people are not stereotypes.\n\nIn the end, rather than labelling people and putting them into boxes (especially labelling people as \"reactive\" compared to \"proactive\" can lead to ressentiment), I think it's always better to discuss openly about what people enjoy and see if a compromise can be reached about the type of expected play.",
            "Yeah I agree and I think it's great you make it work with your players this way. I especially like how you described the \"episodic playstyle\" which you formed over time.\n\nIt's always about finding the best possible compromise for everyone involved.",
            ">\"I hope such players soon realise that frequent passivity has no place in DnD.\" Sorry but no, once more, it's a hobby, played amongst friends, and even if some people are generally passive,\u00a0\n\nThis is definitely something we will just have to agree on disagreeing. I was part of a one shot where one player had no goals for his character yet refused to interact with what the DM prepared. His character was presented as a pacifist and honestly, the player singlehandedly ruined that one-shot. Maybe I am building my opinion about passive playing on an extreme example but I think you need to be at least willing to interact with the world if you want to play DnD. You cannot just sit at the table and say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\", watch your friends die and expect everyone at the table to have fun (unless a very passive playstyle is OK with everyone and agreed upon beforehand).\n\n>Proactive players might be more comfortable in a sandbox-style campaign, reactive players more comfortable in a story-arc campaign, but the main point is that people are not stereotypes.\n\nI agree with this but if a DM struggles to run a sandbox-style campaign and has only proactive players, what is your suggestion? Because such cases happen. Your response makes it seem like people will always just click without any further communication which is not true at all... often you need to work hard to make things work for everyone.\n\nI am actually lucky with having cool players and only after 3 year I realised that two of them are more reactive and the third is proactive, and that is because everything is working just fine and we are all enjoying the campaign but I am sure not everyone will be this lucky.\n\n>I think that the point that you are missing is that this is just a hobby, that you can't change people\n\nWho is talking about changing? Very often you will have a shy player who is afraid to take the spotlight (although he wants to!) so just discussing it with him and encouraging him may be enough to help him overcome his fears. He's not gonna suddenly turn into a arrogant prick... you're just gonna help him enjoy the game more and put forward his own ideas by overcoming his natural shyness.",
            ">You cannot just sit at the table and say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\"\n\nI think that you are confusing two things, one is a player who is mostly passive in general (what 4e called a \"watcher\" - A watcher is a casual player who comes to the game because he wants to be part of the social event. A watcher might be shy or just really laid back. He wants to participate, but he doesn\u2019t really care if he\u2019s deeply immersed, and he doesn\u2019t want to be assertive or too involved in the details of the game, rules, or story. He enjoys the game by being part of a social circle.) and, in your case, someone who actively resists playing the game because there is a misfit between the DM's and his expectations.\n\nIt's very different, and this new \"pacifist\" trend is only a problem in games where violence is expected as part of the playstyle or the universe. But when it manifests, it's not \"passivism\", it's actually militantism and being active, although in a direction opposite to what the DM is expecting.\n\nAnd, if it's part of the setting/game, it would be perfectly appropriate for a character to say \"my character would not join this combat because he's against violence\". It would not be appropriate to a combat focussed game, but there are tons of games in which it would be perfectly appropriate.\n\nDon't judge, and in particular don't judge watchers, it's a perfectly legitimate way to play.\n\nOn the other hand, a player who purposefully creates a character that will not engage with the adventure or other players is a problem, not necessarily inherently, but because of the misfit of expectations.\n\n>I agree with this but if a DM struggles to run a sandbox-style campaign and has only proactive players, what is your suggestion? Because such cases happen.\n\nWhich is exactly why my point of view is that it's useless (in addition to possibly being demeaning) to label players in terms of Proactive/reactive, it's more constructive to discuss about what they actually want to play together.\n\n>I am actually lucky with having cool players and only after 3 year I realised that two of them are more reactive and the third is proactive, and that is because everything is working just fine and we are all enjoying the campaign but I am sure not everyone will be this lucky.\n\nGood for you, but I hope you realise that this is something that came afterwards, so it's not an indication of what works and what does not. Moreover, my experience is that some players are proactive in some segments of the game and more passive in others. For example, some people are very proactive in combat, but much less in roleplaying because of shyness. Broad stereotyping like the one that you are proposing are I think very much misleading and don't bring a lot of value.",
            ">\u00a0to label players in terms of Proactive/reactive, it's more constructive to discuss about what they actually want to play together.\n\nI am confused as to why are you so hell-bent on calling this \"labelling\". My whole point was for people to just take the way they approach games into consideration and just think about whether they are not making life difficult for other players or their DM. I thought I made that clear by trying to offer some advice in the post - and the advice was mostly about \"don't hesitate to talk it through\". Not sure why you turned this into \"labelling\".\n\nMaybe I did not put my thoughts across well.\n\n  \nEdit: Btw was not familiar with a term \"watcher\". I guess that could work if everyone is fine by it.",
            ">I am confused as to why are you so hell-bent on calling this \"labelling\".\n\nBecause it's what you are doing, you are attaching labels to players, and in particular unflattering ones, do you think your passive players would appreciate you telling him \"you are passive\" ?\n\n>think about whether they are not making life difficult for other players or their DM.\n\nThe problem from my perspective is that you are mixing things up. A \"passive\" watcher does not make life difficult for the DM, unless the DM is running a pure sandbox and he has only watchers at his table, for example, whereas a \"proactive\" player might be creating problems for a player running a storyarc and seeing it being derailed constantly by initiatives from that player. But first it's not black and white like this, and second for me the problem is not approaching it from the perspective of being \"proactive\" or \"passive\" (as it can vary from segment of the game to other segments, and it's usually not that strong anyway), but from the perspective of \"Is that player a good fit for what we are trying to play here.\" which is quite a bit more subtle and also less stereotyping of people...",
            ">Because it's what you are doing, you are attaching labels to players, and in particular unflattering ones, do you think your passive players would appreciate you telling him \"you are passive\" ?\n\nOk you just came up with the \"watcher\" label. How is that different? I seriously want you to explain this to me. Your watcher term is more of a label than anything I wrote because I was primarily talking about styles of play.\n\nDid I mention anywhere in the post that you should go out and say \"Hey guys, Jeremy is a reactive player, Julia and tom are proactive players. I want to have two reactive players so one of your will have to switch the style!\" ... because this is how you make it seem with your comments. I seriously don't know what is wrong with you but this \"labelling\" narrative is clearly inbedded in your head and you can't get let it go.\n\n>A \"passive\" watcher does not make life difficult for the DM, unless the DM is running a pure sandbox and he has only watchers at his table,\n\nYou even leveled up the labelling with \"passive watcher\". Well done man.\n\nWhat's funny is that from the very beginning, I added this note in the post: ***PS3:***\u00a0*Obviously I know that most players will encompass both styles of play to some extend so I just simplified it for this post (the two \"reactive\" players of mine also had moments of proactivity which caught me off guard a few times).*\n\nSo I called it out myself that I only wanted to simplify the whole discussion and acknowledged that people cannot be shoehorned into a single \"type\" because it's more complex than that. Yet you seem to have completely missed it.",
            "Actually, I did not come up with it, as I explained, this is an \"official\" label from the D&D 4e rules.
