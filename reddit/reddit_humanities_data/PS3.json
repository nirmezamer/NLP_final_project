            "Yep. I have a PC and PS5 (for college football, and a few other sports games+GTA 6), I also have 2 PS3s. Because I don\u2019t want my PC drives filled up with PS3 games. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a shame too. Because their PS2 emulator is awful. I can only imagine the shitshow a PS3 emulator would be. Sony half-asses BC because they know their modern fanbase will eat up whatever. Don\u2019t even try to bring this post up on r/playstation. Prepare to be downvoted, insulted, and told to buy 30 consoles to play games on, instead of just having one. \n\n\nAnd my personal favorite \u201cI didn\u2019t buy a PS5 to play old games\u201d.",

            "considering xbox series X allows you play most of their best game titles all the way back to the original xbox it is disappointing sony mostly does not have backwards compatibility in their consoles",
            "They are never going to have another backwards compatible unit, because that means they wont sell nearly as many new games. \n\n\nEspecially if it just means they can port their older \"classics\" to run through an emulator that you can buy for $10 on their own store. \n\nSony can't even come up with their own emulator that is good as the independent emu's like Duckstation and RPCS3 that allow you to run these games at 4K resolution and beyond, and run at a locked 60fps frame rate.... on top of actual mods, like texture mods to improve the look of the game as a sort of remaster, or even unlocking hidden content that developers didnt have time to remove from the final game code.\n\nEDIT: Backwards compatibility may become more likely moving forward, since PS4 moving to common x86 PC architecture, games may likely run natively on future consoles because they dont require emulation - much in the same way I can still 20 year old games on PC, on modern PC hardware. The difference, is that we're not going to get any enhanced performance running those older games unless the developers choose to update their games for it. PS4 games run natively on PS5. Only a literal handful of PS4 games arent compatible on PS5.",
            "You should hold onto it for the rest of your life. I still have my original Atari that I got in 1978, my original first model Sega Genesis, my original Playstation from 1996 and the PS One, my original PS2 from launch and 2 more that I acquired, my original PS3 Fat 40gb non backwards compatible from launch, my original PS3 Slim from launch and Super Slim from launch. \n\nI didn't get the first PS4 because I still believed in the PS3. When the PS4 Slim launch I got it and then the PS4 Pro. \nLike most people, I refused to pay top dollar for the PS5, so I waited, and bought it just before the PS5 Slim launched and then got the PS5 Slim a month after launch. \nI will never sell any of my consoles EVER!!!!\nI learned a valuable lesson when the PS2 launched by selling 40 Playstation games to Gamestop and getting only 14 bucks for them. I don't remember what titles I sold but I didn't play them after the first playthrough. But I wish I didn't sell them. I am proud to say that I have over 500 games from Atari to PS5 and will never part with them.",
