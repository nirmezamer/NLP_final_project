            "It usually works for me.\n\nAlthough since I remembered to set games to not be Fullscreen I haven't seen it as much. Somehow between Vicky3 1.5 and 1.7 it got flipped back to Fullscreen and I was crashing all the time.",
            "You need a crash reporter for a crash reporter.",
            "whichg ame was this for?",
            "This usually happens if youre running mods",
            "has anyone ever found a solution with that thing in the history of Windows 10",
            "It never worked... I play paradox games for over a decade, and I would argue that I never not had this problem.\n\nMaybe it's my Software/Hardware, because it would be really strange if they didn't noticed that they never got a single bug report for over 10 years.\n\nAs a software developer I generally prefer to send such reports, because I'm well aware that customer reports of \"x doesn't work\" are quite useless in comparison to a good error file."

My other experiencies with paradox games are:\n\nHOI4: Love It, probably my favourite game.\nVic3: I like the game and all the things you can do but i dont really get to understand It, I know the basics and I can play it and do more or less well but just to a certain point (I have around 30 hours maybe)\nCK2: Its interesting but I often get bored after a while because its like just waiting for your councellor to get a fake claim on a state and then conquer It only for your empire to split in 3 after your dead. (As well as Vic3 I haven't really try to get into it and force myself to learn new mechanics and stuff)\n\nKnowing all this, you people Who have tried all this games think I should buy It or not? Maybe someone could give me a few lines about how the game is? I would really apreciate It. Thanks!!!",

            "Don't worry to much being so aggressive just send a couple of diplomats and everything will be alright. 5 min latter backstab from an ally.",
            "By far the worst PDox game coming from a historicity perspective. The only good thing about it is the loan and debt system. \n\nGet Imperator: Rome instead. It has everything it had and more",
            "Trade and trade companies are basic. Tactical bankruptcies and the 20-> 70 Crownland play are very advanced and many players are never going to do it. \n\nTruce juggling and modifier stacking are optimal plays you should start doing after a few hundred yours, when you already got hold of the basics",
            "EU4 starts in the Renaissance and ends in early industrialization. It's the archetypal grand strategy game. Diplomacy, colonization, war, trade, etc. are all important. For a Paradox game, it had about a medium learning curve, and has a ton of content with DLC that might be overwhelming at first. It has monthly subscription to all the DLC though.\n\n>CK2: Its interesting but I often get bored after a while because its like just waiting for your councellor to get a fake claim on a state and then conquer It only for your empire to split in 3 after your dead.\n\nIf you're only fabricating claims, no wonder you're bored.  Fabricating is meant to be a last resort in CK2 and isn't reliable at all.  Also you can change succession laws or come up with other means so your realm doesn't split during succession.",
            "you know map paint and dlc powercreep?\n\ngood\n\nEU4 is that, no more, no less",
            "If you want to enjoy EU4, you will need to change your approach. if you play eu4 like you do ck2 or V3, you're not gonna have fun. In all those games (EU4 included) I believe you have to have a deep understanding of the mechanics and underlying systems to have fun optimizing and exploiting them, and avoid frustration\n\nIn EU4, you gotta understand trade, diplomacy, army composition, idea sets, national focus / mana management, colonization, religion, and many more systems to start having fun. I recommend playing Portugal, the Ottomans, Sweden, Muscovy and other starter friendly nations to get your bearings and after that start reading the wiki and looking for guides on YouTube / Reddit\n\nI think EU4 is the best strategy game ever made. I have over 3.5k yours in it and I'm certain I'm going to keep playing until after EU5 releases (it looks good but it's obviously not gonna have the same amount of content at launch). \n\nYou should give EU4 a try but understand that you'll start to understand what you're doing and therefore start enjoying the game after at least 100 hours. But then, you can get thousands of hours of enjoyment out of it",
            "Well out of all the pdx games this is the most complicated to reach top level understanding of it. Some specific events you can get, bankruptcy cycling, modifier stacking, trade and trade companies are some of the in-depth mechanics of any strategy game ever and take a lot of time to master.\n\n\nHoi4 and EU4 are alike in the sense that you can know beforehand more or less where your end destination is. In hoi4 you open the focus tree go to the political section and see what claims/alliance your nation has for the historical path.\n\n\nIn EU4 you open the mission tree and is more or less the same in spirit but not as straightforward.\n\n\nOther than that EU4 relies on the outdated mana system which are more reminiscent of the days when it was a boardgame rather than a simulation.\n\n\n\n\nLastly you have to consider that EU4 had many phases of the core gameplay. Buildup, war, colonisation, war buildup and you cycle through them mainly at your discretion. Whereas in hoi4 once you enter ww2 it's just war or in CK2 you are constantly at war whether with your own rebellious subjects or with foreign powers.",
            "Imagine CK2 without Charakters, but the country you are playing is your charakter.\n\nThere are more diplomicy options, more charakter deep (Idea Groups), more missions for your character, more military play and more economy you can handle.\n\nThere is no assassination but still back stabbing between nations.\n\nThe alliances feel more meaningful then in CK.\n\nEtc.",
            "And how does more o less the game work? Are you in control of a country, a House, family or what? And how dynamic is It? \nYeah, on CK2 I also try to get my heir married with other one's heir and do that kind of stuff but somehow It never works out. \n\nThank you for your response",
            "EU4 is in part about the transition from monarchies to states. There's a wide variety of government types with their own mechanics (ranging from Theocracies,  Merchant Republics, Peasant Republics, Monarchies, etc). Your ruler matters but only in so far as their stats determine how much of each of the three primary resources you have. Over the course of the game, you get to customize the cultural and governmental heritage  of your nation. \n\nA couple examples of memorable games:\n\nMy first ever was a Barbary Pirate Republic in Algeirs that conquered Sardinia, down into Central Africa, and Egypt. Eventually basically all of Europe worked together and pushed me south until I lost all my land in North Africa. Reformed into a Merchant Republic and managed to carve out a nice territory in Central Africa.\n\nI started as the Zulu, before my situation changed (this was years ago and I don't remember what prompted this) and I slowly developed and reformed into a proto-socialist Peasant Republic. \n\nA Papal game where I slowly reformed so that while remaining a Democracy, I had a very high tolerance for other faiths and became a pluralistic theocracy. \n\nIdk if it's still the case but one game I tried that used to be *the* broken powerful strategy was an Orthodox Byzantine Horde. Hordes allow ransacking other cities to move the wealth and development to your capitals. Orthodoxy has Icons you choose that increase your development. Become a huge Orthodox raider megacity."

        "content": "I was playing as Byzantium. After many restarts, much savescumming and writing down an entire list of instructions from a video by Ludi et Historia on a piece of paper, and organizing everything step by step, I finally won a war against the turks and took a few provinces from them. They were besieging Constantinople, so continuing the war would mean my certain defeat, and thus, I took advantage of my 20 or so war score.\n\nAfter that, they completely collapsed to the Mamluks. Also, in the coming years, Hungary managed to conquer all of Wallachia, and almost all of the area that would much later be known as Yugoslavia, only except Vardarska and Kosovo, which were controlled by me. I had released Bulgaria as a vassal back in early game, but later integrated them in my country.\n\nThen the Mamluks declared war on me, I hired an Independent army and the Wandering Knights of Rhodes, and with Bohemia as my ally, I barely managed to win the war. I couldn't take any land, so I took 700 ducats or so and asked for war reparations, which was still not enough to fix my economy, as I was drowning in debt.\n\nAnd then, after all of that, Hungary declared war on my, allied to France, and France has Naples under PU. I tried to load my older save, bring my army to their border, hiring mercenaries to scare them into not declaring war, nothing... And if this was the first war, it would be OK. But I am already bad economically. And they are allied to France, that's the problem. And Naples, under the crown of France, is also coming to their aid. Genoa aswell, although (thanks to me) they are a minor nation. What should I do?",

No matter how many allies you have, if you have a bad economy, they do not see that you can defend yourself much, or they have a low opinion, they will not come to defend you if you are attacked",
            "I recommend the guide from redhawk. When I started the game I also looked up several youtubers but from experience his are just the most newbie friendly. Ludi and others are much more advanced and just kind of assume you can play the game to some extend. Redhawk is almost step to step and easy to follow."
