        "content": "**Edit to clarify title: Title sounds a bit harsh after reviewing, I would like to clarify that the source of the fraud charges are currently unknown and have not been confirmed by the fraud department or an external team. That being said after reviewing my purchases alongside any other potential information leaks such as personal data leaks from online purchases for instance, etc... below is the most likely source of my fraud charges. Apologies for any confusion / making it sound as though this is definitely the case. I'd change the title however I am unable to do so**\n\n**Edit 2: I am going to stop following up as I feel like there is enough information here to both clarify any questions people had and also to achieve my intended purpose of warning others that there may be potential fraudsters on the specific line I indicated in the comment section for TD bank. I will only give a followup if the TD fraud department can give me a conclusive answer to my open claim I can share. Again don't be an idiot like me and provide any bank representative with your full bank card information even if you believe them to be a legitimate representative. At the very least ask your bank the verification procedures so you can remain vigilant**\n\nLet me start by saying that this incident was a result of my own negligence. I had my guard down, thinking I was communicating with a secure contact during a stressful situation. It could have been easily avoided if I had been more vigilant.\n\nIn short, I gave my card information to verify my identity to resolve an issue with the card. This led to some minor fraudulent charges, which I detected immediately thanks to TD MySpend. I was able to shut down the card before the charges became serious.\n\nWhat caught me off guard was the boldness of the person claiming to be from TD's internal team. A TD representative later mentioned that this line is handled with a partner company but I can't confirm this.\n\nHeadline: Learn from my mistake\u2014never give out your full card information, even to supposed banking representatives. Especially avoid calling the Canada to US banking line, as active fraudsters are operating there.\n\nHopefully this helps someone down the road as I doubt fraud team will catch these guys as I don't believe they keep internal records of calls, especially if they are working with a partner company on that line.",

They both have good careers in their respective fields, being home cleaning, building, and maintenance. A company offered them jobs for maintaining one of their buildings; my mother to clean apartments before/after people move in/out and my father to repair and maintain the apartments. Best part is, they got an apartment \u201cfor free\u201d (taken from their salaries), which is a pretty good deal considering the current housing situation in Ontario. \n\nThey signed their new lease, offloaded their old lease to a new tenant, and started to move into their new apartment over the weekend. Their first day of work came and everything (by their accounts) went very well and they went home to finish moving. An hour after their FIRST shifts they got a call from their employer/landlord that they were canceling their lease and were not going forward with their employment. So now my parents are without a home, job, and are being forced (as they have no other options) to move into another apartment owned by the same company, and have to pay by next week. \n\nBasically, what course of action do they have? Jobs are horrible in my city, and apartments aren\u2019t going down. Is there some kind of legal means, or something, as there is no other available places for them to live as they just had the carpet swept out from under them. \n\nTo clarify, from Ontario. ",

            "As a car salesmen I\u2019ll give a few tips. \n\nI\u2019ll start with your Toyota Canada quote, it should be similar in price to the website, however Toyota Canada isn\u2019t a dealership so expect dealer fees included. Usually admin which isn\u2019t negotiable, but sometimes they add additional dealer fees that can be negotiated.\n\nIt may not be in your favour to buy cash unless they have explicitly told you the car is available. If they haven\u2019t said that yet, say you\u2019re financing until they admit it\u2019s available and then ask for the cash price. Sometimes dealers will hold vehicles for finance deals because they make more money.\n\nYour negotiation power comes from how many vehicles they have in stock, if they only have 1 and it hasn\u2019t been on the lot very long, then they\u2019re not going to be as willing to reduce price compared that\u2019s overstocked. Do you\u2019re research and see if other dealers in the area have this same car and use that as ammo. \n\nBe polite, be firm, ask questions and ask to see a breakdown of the price. Don\u2019t be a dickhead or else you\u2019ll get fucked, seriously. They may not even want to sell you the car if you piss them off enough. Make sure they aren\u2019t forcing you to buy a protection package if you don\u2019t want one.  The finance/business manager has some power to reduce the cost of the warranty as he makes his commission of that product. In my experience, the business manager will ask upon delivery of the vehicle if you changed your mind about warranty if you initially declined. At this point they may be more willing to reduce the cost over not making anything, but they also may not and then you\u2019re screwed if you actually wanted it so be careful. \n\nThe salesperson is NOT your friend. If they\u2019re good they\u2019ll ask about your life, job, kids, hobbies. All of this can be used as ammunition to close you and back you into a corner where it doesn\u2019t make sense to say no. Try and answer a personal question briefly and switch it to a question you have about the vehicle so that they can\u2019t continue to get more details. Ask some questions at the beginning that will mess up the salesperson, like the type of suspension, size of the gas tank, max range on a full tank. You want to ask a question they can\u2019t answer because it\u2019ll mess up their confidence. Ask like 3-4 of these and you\u2019ll feel a lot less pressured because they\u2019ll be scared you\u2019ll ask another tough one if they keep talking. Don\u2019t make it seem like your horny to buy a car today because they\u2019ll be able to tell. Just be reserved and say something like you\u2019ve just begun your search and are comparing brands. Say this while you\u2019re negotiating though not at the beginning or else they may just launch you \n\nGood luck!",

That way you're not inundated with calls and annoying emails clogging up your inbox...because the salesman are relentlessly annoying. Email 3 dealerships what you're looking for and price. Lowball all of them and see how they react. Keep playing with all of them until you get a feel for where you're getting the best price.",
            "Why not just take the dealer financing to get the best price on the car and then just pay out the loan in full the next month? All car loans in Canada are open ended loans with no prepayment penalty. \n\nThe dealer will hate you because the bank will clawback their finance bonus but who cares.",
            "Others have given good advice. Just a heads up, be prepared to pay more or less the MSRP for the Rav4's. There is a waitlist of 6-12 months for the gas and 12-18 months for the hybrid. I have tried but they aren't willing to negotiate since they don't have vehicles sitting. The most you might be able to haggle is maybe throwing in an accessory or warranty but no guarantee of that.  \n\n\nYou can find dealerships that will not force add-ons, I did when I ordered. I ended up cancelling my order since my order was still a year out and needed a car sooner.",
            "Buying with cash actually gives less leverage as stealerships prefer you finance with them for the kick-back. \n\nI think stock for most cars improved, but a lot of stealerships will try to tag on additional fees/items such as requiring VIN etching for a few hundred.\n\nIf the car is high in demand, expect to pay a dealer \"mark-up\" or to pay for a lot of useless packages. I think for a regular non-hybrd Rav 4, stock should be okay.",
            "you need to walk out on the spot if you don't like anything about the deal.",
            "I you want a Rav4 then there is not much negotiation room...they were on a 2 month wait list in April when I bought a new CRV. \n\n5 different dealerships and none were willing to budge on price. \n\nOtherwise some good advice below about negotiating the best price by negotiating financing...then paying the financing out in month one. Other than the PPSA charges that is probably the best approach.",
            "Visit the dealership a few times. Go to the washroom, look around. At one point you\u2019ll find the salesmen\u2019s lounge or rest area. There usually is a chart indicating each of their sales %performance for each month. Go there the LAST week and see who is the lowest performer. Make sure he is there the day you visit. If that guy wants to make his monthly quota and bonus, he will razor cut the profit margins to get a sale.",
            "Different car, different market, but when I wanted to buy a car in cash without haggling because I knew what I was willing to pay, I emailed six dealers in the city saying exactly that - I'd like to by X car at Y price for cash, let me know if you can make that happen.\n\n\nMaybe 4 emailed me back but only one of them was straight up \"yes, we've got that car on the lot, are you okay with black, we can do that price\".\n\n\nThe no-bullshit attitude in the email translated into no upselling of financing bs, just the usual extended warranty stuff. It was probably their quickest sale and they treated me just fine. (AND I'm a woman who brought my husband and they didn't even try to talk over me at him.)\n\n\nSo yeah, email could be a great screening device!"
