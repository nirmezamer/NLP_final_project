I also really hate how they always calculate things in biweekly payments when I\u2019m trying to see what the total price is. I feel like such a target as a young female walking into these places as I don\u2019t have that much car knowledge either. \n\nAny advice on what to do to not feel like I\u2019m getting scammed? ",

            "Everyone has great advice but one thing thats missing from everyone's post is: go to a dealership with a specific car in mind. Do your research about the car before you even talk to a sales person. You don't need to be a car guy to do basic info searches on various cars to figure out which ones interest you the most. Once you know what you want, go to the dealer to test drive the models you are interested in. Gauge pricing of vehicles based on autotrader and what msrp is listed on the manufacturers websites. Find out the differences in trim levels (the extras they add on) and figure out which one fits both your budget and lifestyle expectations.\n\nThe best way to not get bullied into a terrible decision is to ensure you are as prepared as possible when you go to a dealership. The sales folks have basic info about their cars but you should never ever let them be your source of information. Seek it out yourself and only go to a dealership to test drive, and finalize the purchase.",
            "Don't be afraid to walk away. Do not focus on the monthly payments, look at the total price of the vehicle. Research online what the MSRP should be (you can check the build and price section of any car makers website). Go through the invoice and ask for all fees to be explained to you. \n\nI like bringing a pen and paper to write out what the total payment amount is.",
            "Set boundaries. Do some research before you go to a dealership. Go in knowing what you want, what you can afford, and stick to your guns. Tell them you are shopping around. Make them work to get your business, not the other way around. If they give you pmt #s & you want total cost - ask for it. Dont buy the first thing you see at the first dealership.",
            "If you don't like the vibe of the dealership - don't buy from them.",
            "Carhelpcanada has or used to have no haggle deals with lots of dealerships, check out their website",
            "Check out the cars you like at carcostcanada.com and see what theyre paying at cost.   Add 3% to their cost and.  Bingo bango!",
            "Use an auto broker. I did that 15 years ago and I'd do it again. Made the entire process so easy. I just gave the broker what I wanted after specifying it out on the internet, they'd find the best price and take a cut.",
            "Depending on what car you want, you may not even need to negotiate because it's not available and you're only getting on a waitlist and paying MSRP and if the dealership isn't too bad, no add ons. Looking at you Toyota... \n\nMost other manufacturers seem to be fine and able to put cars on lots. So if you want a Toyota and have your heart set on one, there isn't much negotiating to do.",
            "One piece of advice Ill offer is to always use a loan calculator when making your decision to buy a vehicle. For this, you only need to know the MSRP of the vehicle youre hoping to buy, the interest rate during the term (i.e., 5.49%), and the maximum financing term youre willing to accept (i.e., 84 months). By doing all of the math yourself, with the help of the loan calculator, youll know what to aim for that fits within your budget - and what approximate payment you should accept during your negotiations with the dealership. \n\nWhen doing the calculations, dont forget to add all taxes to the MSRP, prior to calculating the monthly payments. When car dealerships advertise weekly/biweekly/monthly payments on their website or through digital media for a given vehicle, they typically dont include the taxes. This gives the illusion of lower payments for a car you may really want, when in reality the payment is higher.",
            "You can negotiate things like all season/winter tires and floor mats."

        "content": "So there's a townhouse  that's for sale for $400,000 in my area close to downtown( major city ). One across the street sold for over $500,000 with a nearly similar layout but many upgrades.  I wouldn't need a car. I have no debts, no dependents. I bring home about $4800 a month after taxes. Bus to work is 15 minutes, and uber is about 7 minutes.\n\nThe house NEEDS a new roof and furnace. There's also confirmed asbestos around the vents which will need to be removed.  The basement needs to be half gutted, and kitchen and bathrooms need to be redone. The renos I can do but the asbestos, roof and furnace will need to be done professionally. The neighbors are renters but the street is a mix or owners and renters.\n\nAfter doing all the calculations I will have about $900 left over after I pay mortgage, insurance, food, phone, bus pass, taxes, utilities, Internet .etc.  I can put down $50,000(including closing fees) and still have $15,000 in savings.\n\nCan I afford this place my myself or pass?",

            "My only caution is it sounds like this house is a money pit with all the renovations it needs. Just make sure you have adequate budget for these things. A new furnace can be up to 8K, new roof, up to 15K, probably. \n\nIf youre doing renos yourself, itll be cheaper, obviously. But if you arent: a full basement reno, size dependent obviously, will probably be between 25-50K. A bathroom renovation is about 15K and a kitchen would be about 25K. Id say you could probably third or half the budget if you do it yourself.",
            "Yes you can, but you absolutely need to stick to your budget",
            "Yes though I would consider getting a loc for the roof and getting a roommate initially to pay it off.",
            "I don't think you accounted for cost of the reno's. I mean even if you do them all yourself you have to pay for materials. Are you confident that you can do the kitchen and basement without labor costs? Seems like a big job. Removing the asbestos will be a huge cost. Yes you can leave it but honestly I wouldn't feel comfortable with asbestos in the house even though I realize it is not a risk to my health. But that's just me. I would pass. I would rather rent and have a car. Again  my opinion for what it's worth. It may be perfect for you.",
            "I'm less optimistic than others. How are you paying for the new roof/furnace, let alone the other updates. Even if you do the work, the materials cost money and $900 month isn't much to cover all that plus any unexpected life stuff or other \"wants\" (travel, electronic repayment etc).",
            "? Trying to understand how you bring home 4800 per month on 100k salary, should be around 5500 or more depending the province.  I m about 6000 in ontario with same salary",
            "Id recommend you pass. You dont list the renos in the costs you included so youre talking about taking on a $360,000 mortgage leaving only $15k in reserve while needing more than $15k of professional work done on your house.  Youre literally going to drain all your savings and leave yourself without an emergency fund if anything goes wrong. If you lose your job you wont have funds to tide you over and youll lose your house immediately.  Your loan size is also on the larger end given current interest rates so it will be challenging to rebuild your savings while paying it. This means the lack of emergency fund is likely to be a multi year problem not a short term one.\n\nRealistically in the current economy you want enough savings to tide you over for 6-8 months minimum (perhaps longer is ideal given the rapid decline in open roles last month). If your mortgage is going to be 35-40% of your income and your other expenses are another 30% youre looking at potentially $35,000 in an emergency fund minimum + actually affording to pay your contractors.  You probably need another $45k in savings for closing on this property to be low risk.",
            "If a similar house that had a lot of upgrades was $100,000 more and this one not only does not have the upgrades but needs significant renovations do you still think it is worth the 400k$. That is a separate and equally as important question other than just whether or not you can afford it.",
            "Get a thorough home inspection. Probably good to have more than one. That sounds like a money pit.",
            "Can I ask where you find downtown housing for 400k these days?\n\nAnd yes financially you absolutely can do it in your situation. Asbestos...maybe that's the real problem here."

Your mortgage is $480k. To keep things simple, let's ignore land transfer tax, paying your lawyer, etc. Let's assume your interest rate is an average of 3.5% over the 25 years and that your average maintenance fee is $450 per month.\n\n  \nAfter 25 years you've paid off the mortgage and you've put out a total of $600,000 + $238,948.85 (interest) + $135,000 (condo maintenance fees) = $973,948.85. This doesn't take into account land transfer when buying the condo, paying your lawyer, maintenance that you pay for out of pocket in your actual unit and the possibility of special assessments. You would need to sell that condo for over a million dollars after 25 years just to break even, but will that condo will appreciate that much in value over the 25 years? No one knows, but prices can only rise so much.\n\n  \nAm I overlooking something here?

Condo paid off for many years already. \n\nYes I pay maintenance fees, property tax, and utilities, but that adds up to only $1200 total per month. Rent out there is $2500+ per month. And I don't have too worry about moving or rent going up. And while condo values go up slowly, they are still valuable and I do treat it as an asset if I need to sell one day.",
