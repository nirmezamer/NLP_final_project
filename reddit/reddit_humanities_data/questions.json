            "Honestly, I've done the research and am black, and it's very true fore as well. Ive always been one of the fastest sprinters around.\n\nIt's due to an elongated Achilles tendon which provides better elasticity. I think running is actually a plyometric sport, as it's about exploding off of the ground repeatedly, ideally as quickly as possible after the foot touches the pavement. \n\nthe elasticity helps with this, combined with power. There are also theories about black genetics and fast twitchuscle fibres, not sure on that one though.",

            "The ACTN3 RR gene. \n\nWe all have the ACTN3 gene, but it comes in 3 flavors:\n- RR has access to and use of explosive fast twitch muscle and are elite athletes. Highly concentrated in certain Black/African peoples. Roughly 22-25% of humans. \n- RX has normal muscle construction of fast and slow twitch. Roughly 50-60% of humans. \n- XX has no access to or use of fast twitch muscles and are prone to endurance activities. We are all slow twitch muscle people. We live the longest on average too. 18% of humans. \n\nI have the XX ACTN3 gene. I could train and eat identically to an RR person and I\u2019ll never get their gains because I cannot grow or use fast twitch muscle. \n\nFast twitch muscle is the big, bulky muscle, so that\u2019s why sprinters are built as they are. \n\nThis whole thing has changed my life. If I could, I\u2019d have every person tested and provided their ACTN3 gene and then given a basic training plan. \n\nLike, XX should not be doing explosive exercises. I will just strain muscles if I deadlift, squat, or sprint. And RR should not be doing endurance activities \u2014 anything that requires endurance. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s likely more than you wanted to hear but it\u2019s life changing info that anyone can find out via simple dna test.\n\n===\n\nEdit: I used 23andMe for testing. I\u2019ve since learned that a lot of doctors have their own dna testing referral program that might be more affordable.",

So I was curious as to why darker people seemed to be naturally gifted. That being said, I had no trouble keeping up or outperforming. Training was what made people stand out the most, but then again, I was never at Olympic level.\n\nOddly enough, the fastest kid in our region (at the time), was Korean.",
            "The easiest way I can explain it as a ex professional runner. Generally, and simply, black men and women have more elongated muscles with better twitch fibers. Essentially they allow for more explosive and quick movements. Black men are generally faster than white. The trade of is overwhelmingly white men are stronger than black men. All your worlds strongest men are generally white because the tighter muscle structure allows for more raw strength. It is kind of cool to think but black men will generally have better endurance and speed, while white men will generally be stronger and deliver more force.",
