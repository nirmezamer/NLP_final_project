            "Why not just ban carrier locking completely? Why the 60 days bullshit?",
            "Canada has this! Every phone is sold unlocked by law.",
            "From the article: The FCC wants to make it significantly easier for consumers to unlock their phones from their carriers, proposing that all devices must be unlockable just 60 days after purchase. How this will mesh with current plans and phone-buying trends, however, is something the agency is hoping to learn before putting such a rule into effect.\n\nMobile phones purchased from a carrier are generally locked to that carrier until either the contract is up or the phone is paid off. But despite improvements to the process over the years (unlocking was flat-out illegal not long ago), it still isn\u2019t quite clear to all consumers when and how they can unlock their phone and take it to the carrier (or country) of their choice.\n\nTo be clear, this is not about opening up your phone using a face, fingerprint or password, but changing settings in its software to allow it to work with different mobile networks.\n\nFCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, in a press release Thursday. \u201cWhen you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is why we are proposing clear, nationwide mobile phone unlocking rules.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the release says, carriers would simply have to provide unlocking services 60 days after activation. A welcome standard, but it may run afoul of today\u2019s phone and wireless markets.",
            "How about day zero?",
            "You guys still have carrier locked phones? Is that still a thing?",
            "After the SCOTUS ruling this week, will any of this even be enforceable",
            "Carrier-locked Android phones also usually cannot have custom ROMs flashed on them, which shorten their lifespan and contribute to e-waste. \n\nGood on the FCC for this move.",
            "Thanks to the supreme court, the FCC will no longer have the power to enforce this kind of stuff starting today.",
            "Just in time for SCOTUS to say agencies don\u2019t have rule making authority. lol"

            "Man, I love Fujifilm cameras.  I was lucky enough to buy a used Fuji x20 for around $200 off of ebay in early 2014 when I was looking for a secondary camera to a Canon T3i I was using then.  I sent a few messages to the guy who was selling it at such a discount and he told me he wanted to share his love for Fujifilm cameras after purchasing a x100s.\n\nThe build quality, tactile feel, and ALL THE BUTTONS all felt like such a premium package compared to the T3i with the \"plastic fantasic\" 50mm lens I was using at the time.\nThe x20 very quickly replaced the Canon, giving me better images SOOC and I loved being able to shoot and edit the raw photos on the go.  Eventually this led to me buying an xe2 and by the end of 2015 I had sold all my Canon gear.\n\nSince then I have used multiple Fuji cameras with my current lineup being a xpro3 and x100v.  However, I still have the little x20 that I let friends use if they want to try out the Fujifilm system.  I know I have converted at least 3 or 4 other friends to jump onto the bandwagon since I first bought the x20 10 years ago.\n\nFor me seeing Fujifilm explode in popularity is pretty crazy compared to how small they were before, but I know that even back then the quality was above and beyond everything else I had tried so it really shouldn't be a surprise.  \n\nFujifilm fan for life - if anyone is on the fence looking into grabbing a one, give it a shot!",
