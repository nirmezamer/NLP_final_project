            "print right out of the box is very cool and something i'm eyeing pretty hard (in a good way!)",
            "I would love an opportunity to own a Q1 Pro. The heated chamber is a great feature to access the more temperature dependent filaments. Very cool technology all around too.",
            "Full Auto calibration seems like it would make printing so much easier.",
            "The fact that i could introduce my children to this tech would be great. It'll be a great introduction to engineering, which all three are very interested in.",
            "Heres hoping.\n\nCould use some kit to help with rapid prototyping.",
            "The 60 active chamber heating, and the camera have piqued my interest",
            "My favourite feature is clearly the auto calibration, but I find the 1080p camera really usefull, at least in my case.  \nConsidering that I have so many other things to do, being able to periodically check the printer is an exceptional feature.",
            "I like the built in camera",
            "yeah i think id like the time lapse but my fav feature is it is a 3d printer. never had one, would like one",
            "I vote Active chamber heating."

            "I still think delaying the release of the 9800X3D is a bad idea. I would likely buy one if it were to released in the launch window. If not, I'll probably just stick with my 5600X.",
            "The 7950X3D is 90% as fast as 7950X but with significantly lower power draw. I don't give a fuck about gaming. I am sick of engineers just jamming more watts into something to make up for their incometence at microarchitecture. No names, Intel. Wait for the X3D version.",
            "For gaming this tends to happen with AMD where their technically lower powered chips perform better for gaming. The 5600x often outperformed the 5900x because games don't take advantage of all the extra cores and the heat they output meant the 5600x performed better in games that used fewer cores.",

            "I considered buying the 7800x3d when it came out but my 7700x has been more than enough for the games I play like iRacing or any of sim stuff that is CPU heavy so I never bothered.\n\nFunny how idiots downvote just because they don't see the response they crave. Sorry but the 7700x is perfectly fine and you don't need to upgrade if it is performing beyond expectations already. That is called wasting money not everyone needs the x3d chip."
