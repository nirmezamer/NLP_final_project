            "Just started the game last month after a friend told me there\u2019s a mech character being added and I hoarded my stellar jade for her.\n\nI am currently running Firefly, Harmony MC, Gallagher, and Asta. Harmony MC to increase her break effects, Gallagher because he does fire damage and allows her to heal when she attacks (which she does often) and Asta because she also does fire damage and buffs speed to let Firefly attack more often.\n\nUID: 619048916",
            "The usual of course: Trailblazer, Ruan Mei, Firefly, and Gallagher because she deserves the best team with all of her teammates offering break effect, efficiency, dmg, and super break.\n\nMy User ID is 42143522",
            "My best team that helped me clear MOC 12 on full auto is composed of Firefly, Harmony TB, Gallagher, and Ruan Mei. I believe it's the best team composition because the AI can understand the synergy, which helped me clear MOC 12 on full auto. It's crucial to note that if the AI can build synergy, it means the team is well-suited for the task. Realistically, the other three characters enable quicker break effects, and Gallagher provides almost 100% uptime on the heal-on-hit effect, which was originally Luocha's specialty.\n\n  \nUID: 800964046",
            "A nonconventional team for people missing Ruan Mei (and who already went for mono quantum set ups) would be:\nFirefly, Harmony Trailblazer, Silver Wolf, and Fu Xuan.\n\nTrailblazer currently is a must have with Firefly boosting her damage by a ton via super break while boosting the break effect of the whole team. \n\nSilver Wolf for her debuffs/defense shred, pretty decent break efficiency, but more importantly a weakness implant of imaginary for HMC or Quantum for herself and Fu Xuan. This alleviates some cases where firefly is the only one that can do break damage depending on enemy variety.\n\nLastly Fu Xuan to keep everyone alive and having a debuff immunity buffer while keeping the variety of elements low for Silver Wolf's implant. Alternatively Gallagher will work just as well sacrificing sustainability for damage and sp generation as he's already fire element.\n\nHopefully this aids the Silver Wolf havers or those whom want to play something else besides the traditional FF, HMC, Ruan Mei, and Gallagher team!\n\nID: 101633822",
            "My best synergy team for firefly is herself, silver wolf, male harmony mc, and blade.\u00a0\n\n\nThe reason firefly will work well with them because they're doing great working together in Penacony (silver wolf & blade), best stellaron hunter team for her. And finally male mc harmony is there for best skill synergy and best moral support for her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMy hoyoverse ID\u00a011488896, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n*Edit grammar\u00a0",
            "For me it's Firefly, Trailblazer, Ruan Mei, Gallagher.  \nTrailblazer for boosting super break damage, Ruan Mei for boosting firefly speed to breakpoints and some shred res for super break damage and Gallagher because it's only sustain doesn't eat skill points (my firefly is c0) and break damage amplification.\n\nID:326166053",
            "Right now I'm using Ruan mei, Fu Xuan (until i can get Gallagher decently built to try him out), harmony trailblazer, and Firefly. All the break effect\n\nUID: 15816846",
            "I have Firefly, Harmony MC, Ruan Mei and Gallagher as a team!\n\nNot only they work well, I just really want Firefly and TB as a pair, and apart from Ruan Mei I never tried to play Gallagher yet and I really wanna do a team with the Super Break mechanic. Interaction wise I think Firefly wouldn't expect to be in a team like this!  \nMy hoyo id is 600741769",
            "My synergy team will be Firefly, Caelus, Topaz and Fuxuan\n\nThe reason I chose this is because I ship firefly and Caelus and they worked well together in penacony. I chose topaz as she has one of my favorite designs and Fuxuan to solo sustain. Topaz can also be a great team moral supporter for team. (this is a team composition for fun) \n\nID : 808544201",
            "Gallagher, Firefly, Trailblazer (Harmony), Robin\n\nAll are characters that debut during the Penacony arc and has interacted with Firefly! Firefly holds amicable friendships with Robin and Trailblazer. Gallagher might have been a questionable character during a part of the story but he was able to collaborate for Firefly later. Gallagher can sustain (while also improving break effect for Firefly) while Robin and Trailblazer provide a helping hand for the team, enabling further damage and super break.\n\n I also think this team is suitable for having a party! Robin brings the music and sings, Trailblazer dances, Firefly is the cheerleader and watcher from the audience and Gallagher brings the snacks. This team is suitable for gameplay and lore as well n.n\n\nID: 19602446"
