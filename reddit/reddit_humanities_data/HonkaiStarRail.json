            "What I really like about this whole Firefly thing is that she was this genetically engineering human being now that her purpose is over she has to try to find this new purpose aside from her SAM/Mecha and thats like the beauty of her drip marketing as it shows Firely and not Sam because this is who she truly is and wants to become and wanting to know us the Trailblazer as Firefly and not Sam I hope we get to see more of her in the upcoming stories along with the other Stellaron Hunters. Her gameplay is so good its like an upgraded version of Seele's E2 if you have Firefly E2 and you just take so many turns off break and its actually probably on of the most cost friendly team comps their is atm the only trouble would be getting her and Ruan Mei and the whole irony of her team comp one tries to create a Pseudo Emanator of Propogation and one impales her for her script. She is just simply adorable an angel I hope to feed her more Oak Cake Rolls \n\nID - 23597858",
            "My favorite thing about Firefly is she felt so... genuine. It's hard to explain, but she seems so concerned for the trailblazer and every scene with her was so good. Her character has so much depth and complexity, but at the same time, she could be so sily and a bit of a loveable dork. I was so invested with every moment of her story. \nMy Hoyo id is: 333442196",
            "What I adore most is the voicing by the JP VA. I think all the VAs give a great performance but the JP version stands out for me, maybe because of her own medical illness.\n\nid 34259397",
            "One of my favorite things about Firefly is her backstory for sure. Before her video about the fighting of Glamoth, she was already a pretty lively and enjoyable character. But, with the release of her story and how she became who she is today, she became a much more interesting character to me as she isn't just Trailblazer's favorite with no purpose. Knowing what she lost makes her happiness so much more genuine and easier for me to enjoy. Top tier character :)\n\nUID: 214288544",
            "What makes Firefly special to me is the differences between her and SAM even though she is the one in control of SAM. The way she acts so sweetly and genuine outside of SAM when talking to Trailblazer and when she's SAM, she's completely different and ruthless. My mind still has a hard time wrapping around the idea that SAM and Firefly are the same character but it was done so well.\n\nAID: 85416732",
            "What i enjoy about firefly, honestly, everything. Her voice, her design, her story. ID 34871469",
            "    I love everything about Firefly, her story, her development as a character,her mech and especially her voice actress in JP and EN, I'm a fan of both. I love her. The owner of my jades.\n    \n    id:600563757",
            "I love characters with gray/white hair, instantly fell in love after the first time seeing her in Penacony. Plus her personality, the contrast in her Sam mode and her usual self is just phenomenal.\n\nUID: 817271316",
            "My favorite thing about Firefly is her color scheme. I adore the minty teals with the white and brown accents but paired with her ult form with the glowing wings and the bright red and orange flames it just looks stunning.\n\naid: 19317177",
            "I like Firefly's mech suit! It's cool to have robot playable characters since they're unique and look strong. Firefly's design is also nice, so it is like getting two characters for the price of one! \n\nHoYoverse Account ID: 46258257"
