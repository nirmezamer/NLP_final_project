Chan imageboards are nice and I use them a lot but they can't fill the same hole as reddit either due to their disorganized, anonymous nature.

Even if Biden doesn't win, what's gonna stop Trump from running AGAIN in 2028 if he's still alive?!

Biden is probably gonna die if he's elected again and that would give Trump another chance to run again, on top of ruining any chances for democratic candidates in the coming years.

I know so many who hate Biden so much they're considering on voting for Trump again, which is the whole reason Biden even won in the first place. \n\nTrumps more than likely going to win in this next election, and I, once again, am not going to vote for either party.
