            "My thoughts.\n\n1. I appreciate the mods efforts - I know it isn't easy to run a sub like this where you're getting pressure from the users on one side and Reddit on the other.\n\n2. Reddit's policy as listed above, is obviously racist and sexist, based on its protected vs unprotected classes.  The same racist statement that will get you censored or banned becomes just fine and will probably be upvoted once you redirect it at white people.\n\n3. Aside from sexism and racism, it is just bad all around.  In 1901, WEB Dubois, the first black Harvard PhD, earned in sociology, wrote a book called the Philadelphia Negro, in which he talked about the challenges facing the black community.  Not just this book, but any detailed discussion of its points would be banned on Reddit.\n\n For a more recent example, in  2008 as a Presidential candidate, Obama gave a father's day speech supported by statistics in which he specifically told black fathers that they needed to do more to improve the outcomes of their (black) children.  I believe this speech, or any detailed discussion of it, would be banned as well.\n\n4. Having \"protected\" and \"unprotected\" classes will absolutely be abused and in fact I know it is already been abused by trans activists.  You should be on the lookout for people posting false and even sexist and racist arguments that, if you refute it, will get you banned.\n\n Trans example:  Someone says that trans children should be given puberty blockers.  Well, what exactly is a trans child?  You can't have that discussion, because it will invariably involve trying to figure out who is trans and who isn't.  (Even if you're a pediatrician, or it's your own child.)\n\n Race example:  Someone says white people are responsible for most hate crimes against asians.    Based on Reddits policies, virtually anything you do to try to refute this point will get you banned.\n\n5. Complaining on reddit may be easy and might feel good but in the end it doesn't do much.  Contact your state attorney general, which is likely an elected position, and ask them if it is acceptable for a company to have a set of rules that protects certain sexes and races and not others to operate in their state.  For extra points, do it publicly, and let the opposing party know what you are doing, and they can use it in their election campaigns.",

They have such disdain and hatred for the other side they refuse to even acknowledge a word that is spoken. \n\n\nAnd then at some point good old Joe wanders out into full public view and is standing naked and is Stark raving mad",
            "It's been painfully obvious for several years that President Biden is dealing with progressing vascular dementia. It's sad to watch him struggle to get his point across. You can't help but feel bad for him. \n\nThe people who should feel truly ashamed of themselves are his family, for not intervening in his best interest when he decided to run again, and the media, who did everything they could to downplay or outright conceal his OBVIOUSLY DETERIORATING mental acuity."
