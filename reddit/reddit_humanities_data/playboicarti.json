Obviously there have always been rappers that did stuff like this but I feel like in the last 5-10 years it\u2019s become just expected that if you\u2019re a rapper you fuck underage girls and beat women, pretty much no other profession would tolerate this for so long, idk what the solution is but there\u2019s gotta be a better alternative to what the rap industry has become",

            "a major upside of the kendrick-drake beef is that all of these rappers\u2019 weird ass activities are being focused on a lot more. Besides all of drake\u2019s nasty behavior, how tf travis and 21 savage date Rubi Rose when she was underage??? And how did tyga just get away with dating Kylie at 17? Or Juice dating a 14 y/o at 18? \n\nAnd specifically about X, it\u2019s crazy that people thought he flew out a 16 year old model who was a fan of his for \u201cjust a photo shoot.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising he did this shit.\n\nY\u2019all think your favorite rapper isn\u2019t participating in this nasty shit with minors? He a FAN, he a FAN, he a FAN.",
