        "content": "This is post for venting. I am really tired of UberEats and their stupid policies. \n\n1) The other day, I ordered an item for my friend in a different city (Chicago). The driver didn\u2019t even bother delivering the order. Took an image of an entirely different order, from a different restaurant, that was already lying there in the lobby, submitted of that order as a proof of delivery and completed the trip. \n\nOutcome: I paid an insane amount for the food, which UberEats claims was delivered (as per their policies) and hence it\u2019s not eligible for refund. I paid for a delivery that never happened. \n\n2) Today I ordered 2 items which included a can of coke. Upon delivery, I see the coke can is missing. I file a complaint again stating my drink is missing. \n\nThis is the response I get \n\n> After looking into this order and the information provided, it was determined that the delivery matches the order. Therefore this order can't be refunded.\nIn addition, after reviewing your account, we\u2019ve noticed repeated violations of our refund policy. We encourage you to review the Uber Community Guidelines if there are further questions.\n\nWhat did I do for that I get flagged for repeated violations?\n It\u2019s not like I\u2019m claiming refunds for every order I make (I order often and I have good enough history for that).\n\nThe complaints I filed are genuine cases where one or the whole is stolen from me and I still have to pay it. \n\nI think messing around with customers is part of their policy. Might as well steal my money and call it a part of their policy.\n",

I had a order this evening that was 20 minutes drive time each way, when I got there the note displayed requesting that I get him WEED (we live in Nm where it's legal) and drop it off and included his phone number. When I got there he begged me to give him a ride to the weed shop before they close and said he'll fill up my tank and give me 40$. I chose to help him out to be kind. He did fill up my tank but when I dropped him off he tried to get me to go into his trailer and asked me for a kiss. I reported the sexual harassment to Uber eats and they just said they won't pair us together.",
