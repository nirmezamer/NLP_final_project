I refused both so he took the 10$ tip away and I lost money on that order having drive a total of 40 min (20 each way) for 2$. When I called customer service to report the man all they did was remove him from my pairing!!!!!! What about the next female delivery driver!?!? How am I the one being punished for holding onto my MORALS!?!?",

I then contacted my credit card company, asking if there was an additional/pending charge for the $58 and no \ud83d\ude11 the $52 has posted at this point, and there are no incoming charges for the additional $58.

My coke was now about a 2/3s empty and my remaining fries are soggy and taste of coke \n\nIs this the drivers fault or McDonald\u2019s fault for not securing the drink better?\n\nCan I complain and get some money back as I lost part of my meal?\n",

            "Not to blame the victim here, but for many reasons, the best solution is to never order soft drinks via UberEats. Ever. Nothing good can from from it. From the fact that it can sit on a counter for 30 minutes (or longer) while the driver waits in a drive-thru line, to the way they precariously package them up and then seal the bags, to the fact that they're subject to a car ride to your house while the driver's attention is on driving, just nothing can end well.",

            "Hard to tell where the fault lies, could be either, could be a combo of both the driver and the restaurant. Just access your pass orders in the app and report you had an issue with it. The app will ask you to take pictures of the damage and it \"should\" give you a credit. I highly recommend not calling support as they will just make you wait and generally ignore anything you say."
