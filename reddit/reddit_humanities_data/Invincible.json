When you first started working on the series in the early/mid 2000's, did you ever in your wildest dreams see the series becoming such a hit, and when was that moment? How does it feel to see Invincible break into the mainstream and become a huge part of pop culture?"

Terra would die if he went too fast, but it would require both Marks hands to kill that little Sadist. \n\nBut Mark isnt totally blameless here. All it would take is Mark just relaxing for one moment and realizing if he sets her down on the floor, he could grab that little shit and snap his neck. But he was so panicked he actually made things worse.",

All plot-driven narratives aside Mark is weak when he wants to be like in the anssia situation  I believe after Conquest 2x Mark shouldve bodies everyone else except thragg and BB ",
