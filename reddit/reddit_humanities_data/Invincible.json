            "Like what? Thragg has dozens of Viltrumites on earth. If Mark and Nolan try to fight him then and there, they'd lose.... badly. And then the kid gloves would come off and earth would become Thragg's breeding camp.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead Nolan and Mark decided to take the truce. Mark because he didn't want to risk the lives of innocent humans trying to fight off 30+ Viltrumites, and Nolan because he suspected that Viltrumites who lived long enough among humans would come to see us the way he does.\u00a0\n\n\nThey had to agree to a truce sure, but I think Nolan was the real winner here since he was right.\u00a0",

            "Letting the Viltrumites stay on earth and start families was not a mistake. As we learned they all became big softies. \n\nI think the real error was how Nolan dealt with Thragg when the Viltrumites turned on him and made Nolan their leader. \n\nThey should have forced Thragg to also go to earth and start a family, and I wager he would have also turned into a more empathetic person. That or kill him. Exiling him was a bad idea.",
            "From Earth's side? Not really.\n\nI mean, what choices do they have? The Viltrumites are clearly monitoring the planet and things coming to it from orbit. If they act against the Viltrumites, the Viltrumites will know, and they will retaliate. There is no force on Earth that can stop them if they decided to attack. They could kill everyone if they wanted to.\n\nYou can't even subtly do it - like  if they had Nolan and Mark going around killing Viltrumites 1 at a time, like only once a week or month - they'd still see that as an attack, because a Viltrumite can't get murdered in the street by some crackhead, so they'd know you were up to something.",

            "Thragg is one of my favorite OP characters in fiction. He's so scary. He's the strongest force in this universe, but he'll also negotiate with you if it's convenient for him. But those negotiations have this looming feeling of threat to them, since he has resting mad dog face and very well might get annoyed and kill you.\n\n\nThe scariest moments are when he controls himself, like when he resisted the urge to pop Ursaal's head. He's clearly has an emormous rage problem, but he also has such will that he can actually stifle it completely, and does so almost all the time. It's like sharing a room with a T-Rex that's visibly shaking from how badly it wants to bite you.",

            "Yeah, Thragg IIRC via Kirkman was said to be the strongest character in the verse Pre time skip and it\u2019s relatively obvious off statements and feats alone.\n\n-He effortlessly stomped the shit outta both Mark and Nolan 2v1.\u00a0\n\n-Killed Nolan in their 3rd fight.\n\n-Utterly left Conquest and (after several Zenkai boosts) Allen in fear of engaging him in combat, as well as shredded Thadeus who was matching Kregg and Anissa punch for punch.\u00a0\n\n-Killed multiple Ragnars with his bare hands (who\u2019re the only race powerful enough to kill a some of the strongest Viltrumite like Anissa and brutally injured Conquest).\n\n-And fought The Scourge of the Twin Galaxies in Battle Beast for weeks on end without tiring and was the only opponent Thokk deemed as\n\u201ca worthy adversary\u201d.\n\nThe only showing close to an anti-feat for Thragg\u00a0was when he got beat down by 6 viltrumites and lost to Mark in the \u201cEnd of all Things\u201d when they were in the Sun.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to say that Viltrumites only did that because they had the \u201cnumbers\u201d advantage not because they were \u201cstronger\u201d, because individually they\u2019d get their asses beat by Thragg otherwise without massive help.\u00a0\n\nAnd Mark (even after Eve making him a little stronger after reviving him from death) didn\u2019t really overpower Thragg, and needed help from Robot to put him down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo in conclusion, if the show so far is good at \u00a0showcasing how strong Nolan is so far, they\u2019ll do justice to Thragg.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
