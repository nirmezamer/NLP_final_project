        "content": "[https://painttouches.com/2024/06/28/the-big-easts-new-480-million-tv-deal-is-a-huge-win-for-all-basketball-fans/](https://painttouches.com/2024/06/28/the-big-easts-new-480-million-tv-deal-is-a-huge-win-for-all-basketball-fans/)\n\n\n\nThis is a Marquette blog, but it's an absolutely fascinating read if you're interested in media rights and the details around it.\n\nSummarizing the summary:\n\n* **Money:** The Big East is going to get \\~80 million a year for media rights.  Basketball CAN exist in the same world with the football schools, but we'll always be paddling behind.  So megadonors, university investment, etc - especially with most of the BE schools being small urban private schools, will drive how competitive teams in the league can be.  Looking at you, DePaul.\n* **Money compared:**\n   * Football:  AAC's ESPN football media rights are $83 million a year through 2032.  So the Big East will be making more per-team in basketball than the AAC's football.\n   * Basketball:\n      * The A-10 got $6 million in 2022 for media rights, so each Big East team will be making more annually than the entirety of the A-10 as a league.  Let's hope those guys get another raise soon.\n      * It's not all rosy the Big East shares Fox with the Big Ten. If you assume the Big Ten's basketball is worth 15% of their total media rights, their basketball is worth $200 million a year. Regardless of how strong or poor the teams in the B10 are, their massive alumni bases are bound to draw more ratings.\n* **Just tell me everything will be on cable:** Mostly, and broadly distributed which will get the league some nice exposure.  FOX, FS1, FS2, and TNT will be broadcasting.  Very excited about TNT's capabilities considering how well produced and fun the NBA analysis is with Shaq, Barkley, etc.\n* **Basketball is still worth something to linear cable broadcasters:**\n   * TNT, FOX, NBC, and CBS (before dropping out) were/are all partners of the Big East.  That's a lot of networks wanting inventory.  There's still a market for college basketball, despite some of the doom and gloom around no one caring about the regular season.\n   * That said, the Big East has won 4 Nattys since they signed with FOX in 2012 after the C7 split off.  They've had an unbelievable run.  Hopefully it can stay competitive, as ratings correlate heavily with poll rankings.\n* **But I hate Peacock:** Streaming, specifically on Peacock, is not going away.  The author estimates \\~25% of Big East games (including Noncon, Conference, and BE Tourney) will be on Peacock.\n* **We could still be screwed:** The Big Ten/SEC might still ruin everything in 2032 when the NCAA tourney media deals are up for bidding and form some sort of frankenmegaconference.  It's no surprise that the Big East's negotiated Madison Square Garden contract ends right around that time as well.\n\nTLDR - basketball fans can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for \\~6-8 more years when this is all going to start getting a little weird again in the 2030s.\n\nAlso, Val Ackerman, the conference's commissioner, deserves a fat raise for snagging UConn. back.  My understanding is that that decision was not a unanimous one and was hard-fought to convince some university presidents to let them back in.  What a phenomenal decision to invite them back one, and hike the exit fee to $30 million.",

            "Get ready younger folks to teach the boomers how to go back and forth between regular tv and peacock",
            " Big East Basketball has been must see for the last couple seasons. Good to see them be rewarded.",
            "My analysis: DePaul, Butler, Seton Hall - thanks for nothing. Georgetown and Nova? Figure it out. Thanks.",
            "Yes, fuck Peacock. Bad selection of tv shows/movies. Plus only half of Brooklyn NINE-NINE! is on Netflix. So I may have to binge-watch B99 on Peacock in one month before I have to commit to paying anything.\n\nWait, this is about college basketball. So, BET first round is on Peacock. Its still entertaining and shouldn't be behind a paywall!",
            "My biggest takeaway is that if the Big East can get $7 million a school for just basketball, what can the Big 12 do if it continues to dominate in basketball.",
            "I dont think the Big XII is going to have separate TV deals for FB and MBB. That would be a very interesting setup, but not sure if that is feasible.",
            "Uhh, whos been dominating??? And, no, youre not getting me to Kansas City over MSG. We will accept non-conference basketball games in exchange for football-only affiliation, though! Not that youd want that",
            "Undoubtedly, alumni base size and presence in the top 25 rankings matter most to how well conferences fare in media ratings.   \n\nIt is still fascinating to me to watch teams like Providence or Seton Hall with sub-$500 million endowments, and 5-10k students managed to get where they are, whereas Fordham, St Louis, etc with 1 billion + endowments and comparable enrollments continue to wallow in mediocrity.",
            "To be fair, MSG organizers love scheduling Big XII teams in recent years, so catching games in both Kansas City and MSG hasnt been a mutually exclusive selection for a while."
