Sounds fair to me. \nThe company don\u2019t want to pay it because it\u2019ll open the flood gates across the industry. Since the crash in 2008 wages have basically been repressed. I\u2019m not in the industry but when I was a service tec in 2008 I was earning ~\u20ac50k/yr. That\u2019s still the rate!!! Maybe even less.
