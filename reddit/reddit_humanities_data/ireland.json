            "From reading the article am I right in saying the hospital were pushing for a cesarean because a natural birth was too high risk so she decided to do the high risk natural birth anyway without any medical support?\n\n\nFirst of all, that's nuts, second, that doula should be charged and jailed if there is any proof she in any way encouraged this women to take this risk.",

Naomi was an absolutely sensational woman and birthed her baby boy with incredible power.\"\n\nWhat a weird comment in the circumstances. She still absolutely believes it was the superior course. The article says she ran a 'retreat' that Naomi and other pregnant women attended. Strong cult vibes.",

            "I remember being in labour one night when a mammy and baby died in the room next to me. The howls of her husband I can still hear now 25 years later. I\u2019ve had 7 kids, started with elective c section, banged out 5 with no pain relief, and finished with the rotunda saving mine and my babies life with an emergency c section. Never once, after how many babies, would I think it\u2019s a great idea to give birth at home. Fuck whoever convinced that woman it was gonna be ok. I feel sorry for her babies.",
            "Childbirth is like a medically controlled car crash. Do it unsupervised at home and it\u2019s just going to be a car crash. I\u2019m sorry - and I know some women have bad experiences and want a less formalised setting. But in prior decades and centuries, childbirth was the leading cause of death for women. Turning your nose up at the medical profession is not safe.",
            "Mad to think that we progressed so far past the massive risk and occurrence of incidents of women dying in pregnancy that people now willingly try to avoid medical interventions at all costs."

Hill was not steep but scooter is heavy and I am not physically strong. \n\nMiddle aged farmer dude comes pootling up behind me on HIS ancient crappy scooter, gives me a nod, puts his boot on the back of my bike and drives forward propelling me and my scooter up to the crest of the hill. And then he just drove off with me yelling xiexie ni (Thank you) after him,\n\nNot a word spoken by him throughout the whole thing. (Guy didn't even crack a smile.

Beautiful, warm, welcoming people, spectacular scenery, history in every footstep and the best food on the planet. I\u2019m 55 this year and a grandparent.
