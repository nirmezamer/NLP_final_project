            "If this is a dropped minecart contraption like it seems to be, then the reason is that you don't have two layers of drills, gravity powered drills are pretty buggy unless you do that. The alternative is using a rope pulley to move it up and down, and that would let you keep its current aesthetic more intact",

            "Every ten seconds it stops and if you dont press buttons on all 4 clawtracks it explodes",
            "How fast is it going, plus, maybe consider a second layer of drills! Contraptions going vertically will often miss blocks",
