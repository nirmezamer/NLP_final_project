Enjoy your retirement from the sub!\n\nAt this time our team is drafting changes to make for the convenience of not only ourselves when modding but also for the convenience of you, the users. These changes will include rule changes. We plan to make them easier to understand which we believe will make them easier to follow and lead to less confusion in the future. An announcement will be made when these new rules are ready, please be on the lookout for that.\n\nIn addition to this we plan to implement some browsing changes including the removal of the ability to post links. we believe this will lead to less spam bots such as Temu and Onlyfans bots.\n\nLastly, Mod applications are reopening starting now. If you believe you will be a good fit for our team feel free to apply, even if you have no prior modding experience.  (We will not be hiring right away if you are selected)  [Application Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_ndAtJBvlBwryjuWnq1PGtWX6cTJ9_vh8f4330sGYIc/edit?pli=1)\n\nThank you all for being apart of the sub!",

            "This place is growing. I keep getting interested in discussions just in time to see them locked/removed. I get halfway through the OPs opening text while scrolling, and open the thread to find it removed. No offense to you whatsoever, but You're kind of swatting perfectly good content away like it's your job. I wanna make the suggestion to just let it ride. You are NOT going to prevent redditors from being rude to one another and off topic. You might as well just close it down if that's your goal. And how exactly was the pizza sandwich thread off topic? This is random thoughts. I really liked this place because the content could vary by a lot. Now it's like you're rushing and scrambling to keep it small and pleasant, but all that's happening is people getting frustrated with the unnecessary censorship.",

The names of the colors are just words that could be literally anything. I could teach my daughter to say blue when she sees yellow, green when she sees purple, etc. And if no one ever corrected her, it would change nothing about the world. You feel me?",
