Enjoy your retirement from the sub!\n\nAt this time our team is drafting changes to make for the convenience of not only ourselves when modding but also for the convenience of you, the users. These changes will include rule changes. We plan to make them easier to understand which we believe will make them easier to follow and lead to less confusion in the future. An announcement will be made when these new rules are ready, please be on the lookout for that.\n\nIn addition to this we plan to implement some browsing changes including the removal of the ability to post links. we believe this will lead to less spam bots such as Temu and Onlyfans bots.\n\nLastly, Mod applications are reopening starting now. If you believe you will be a good fit for our team feel free to apply, even if you have no prior modding experience.  (We will not be hiring right away if you are selected)  [Application Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_ndAtJBvlBwryjuWnq1PGtWX6cTJ9_vh8f4330sGYIc/edit?pli=1)\n\nThank you all for being apart of the sub!",

If someone shares an interest and you hit it off from there, more power to ya, but don't go digging through their history projecting the person you want them to be onto them. That will only ever backfire.",

Sometimes I'll go through someone's post history and upvote all of their downvotes if they seem like a good person, but I never message anyone.\n\nTbh, it feels like most people are afraid to be the first one to reach out. I'm sure we all have our reasons for not doing so. But you have to wonder how many lifelong bonds that could have been formed just never happened because of that fear.",

I couldn't give a shit what a family member or anybody else would think of the things I've said if they saw it. If anything, I would argue that if someone took the time to actually read my posts and comments, they could get to know me and what I'm going through in life pretty well actually, instead of just judging and shaming (especially like the religious folk love to do)",
