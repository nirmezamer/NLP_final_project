            "Tip: you can use the Fel Pumpkin from Botania to summon a Blaze to capture in a Create Blaze Burner.",
            "If you're looking for a 'starter project' once you have an initial base, look no further then a Cobbleworks. Cobblestone is magic in minecraft, even in vanilla; With just vanilla, cobblestone is not just the expected stone products, but also moss, dirt and its byproducts (including clay, insert balanced meme here), and even bonemeal. With mods included? You can typically add gravel and sand, and all the things you can process that down to that depends on the mods involved, but can include just about every basic overworld resource. That's without counting stuff like Botania's orechid straight up converting it in to ores. A cobble-processing system should always be one of the first big projects of a world, and something to revisit as the player progresses to see what said progression has further opened up.\n\nAlways check what a wandering trader offers, at least in the early and mid game. Not only can they have saplings that could take you thousands of blocks of travel to get and nautilus shells, but quite a few mods add their own trades to them, such as Apotheosis' overenchanted special named gear that is game-changing early on. If you are just shy of being able to do the trade? Shove them through a nether portal. As long as that part of the nether isn't loaded, their despawn timer shouldn't count down, buying you extra time to gather what you need.\n\nWardens only fire their sonic boom if their target is within 15 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically. They are easily killable from range with no risk, as shown by Pixelriffs killing 30 wardens in about an hour here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roYtYWEGztk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roYtYWEGztk) Between mods adding drops to give more reason to kill them, and modpacks adding quests to kill them, that changes the Warden from being a scary challenge to an annoying speedbump.",
            "You can use create's mixer for recipes from [Let's do] vinery. Easter to automate and sometimes allows usage of different juices.",
            "Tip: Create Bottomless Hose Pulley does not require 10,000 Source Block. 2 Source block is the bare minimum, flowing counts.\n\nHow it work is that the hose pulley hose lowered to touch the first source, and it will read if there is 10,000 liquid in between to the top.\n\n\nWorks in every version of create.",
            "If you have Refined Storage and AE2 on the same pack, try to keep your RS network small and use it in the same way subnetworks work in AE2 if you have a potato pc and want to save frames. \n\nTry and automate ANYTHING POSSIBLE with AE2 subnets as they are EXTREMELY powerful for anything you can think of. Think automating AE2 circuits without taking up any channels on your main network AND all you have to do to make any circuit is supply the raw materials so it can easily be put into a pattern.\n\nThink of literally anything to automate. You might not think it would be possible to automate magic mods that aren\u2019t programming based, but think again. Combined with integrated dynamics, literally anything is possible. As in using raw block data possible.\n\nAlso try to learn red stone logic for AE2 since even a simple AND red stone gate is enough to make sure you have the right materials queued in a recipe or order and it\u2019s even more powerful with red stone add on mods.\n\nThis might not rub off on more experienced AE2 players, but less experienced players might not realize how tremendously powerful AE2 and other logistic mods really are and might not think to do some of these things.",
            "In Ominous Woods biome from Biomes'O Plenty only enderman and cave spiders (and I think illusioners in newer versions) are allowed to spawn , so farming for enderpearls there could be very fruitful and safe (or you can just not meet a single mob for entire night)",
            "If you have plates, gears in a modpack, tinker's construct's smeltery can produce them more efficiently, for example:\n\n2 ingots for a plate in a crafting table, 1 ingot for a plate in tk smeltery\n\n4 ingots for a gear in a crafting table, 2 ingots for a gear in tk smeltery\n\nworks in many modpacks (enigmatica 2 expert, for example, you get a better ingot --> plate ratio, but doesn't work with gears). It's a great alternative before you get a machine capable of making plates.",
