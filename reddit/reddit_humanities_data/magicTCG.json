        "content": "This is a place for asking simple questions that might not deserve their own thread. For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.\n\nWe encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.\n\n**Rules Questions**\n\nRules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).\n\n**Deckbuilding Questions**\n\nIf you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.\n\nAdditionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as \"what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?\", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions**\n\n> _I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?_\n\nDon't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call \"The List\".\n\nYou can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website. For example, the contents of The List for Streets of New Capenna boosters can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14).\n\n> _My foil card has a shooting start symbol over the bottom left. I can't find anything about it online._\n\nAll old-bordered foils have the shooting star symbol. Most sites that display card images just overlay a generic foil graphic over all foil cards, which doesn't include the shooting star. Your card is normal.",

            "If you flicker a Saga when the last lore counter is put on it, can you resolve the final chapter's triggered ability without sacrificing the Saga?",
            "What type of slivers should I use? I've sent the giant list of lost popular ones on edhrec, but I'm not sure which effects are best. I'm running a [[sliver legion]] deck but only want 20-30 slivers in there. It's a multi tribal deck with a main silver theme. So which static abilities from my slivers should I be focusing on most? What's the balance of evasion and anthems and other stuff? I hope they makes sense",
            "Yes, assuming you flicker the saga while the final chapter ability is still on the stack. Once the final chapter ability triggers, it will resolve even if the Saga leaves the battlefield. And when the Saga re-enters the battlefield, it's treated as a new object with no relation to the one you flickered.\n\nWhat you **can't** do is wait for the final chapter ability to resolve, then flicker it. The Saga will be sacrificed before you even get priority to cast your flicker spell.",

            "How come Ive seen a lot of Standard Red aggro decks on deck lists not running slickshot showoff? It seems like one of the best cards in the deck to me.\n\nIt does get removed a lot but that opens up space for ur other creatures. It just seems all around really good, both in a specific way as a threat that can one shot a lot of damage,  has haste and versatility in plot and flying both to dodge attacks and block flying for a kill with an instant.",

            "Since polls can't be made, is it safe to say that around 80% of people store their magic cards in a BCW cardboard box yes? If that's most peoples main method of storage, I don't see how talk about the storage containers themselves isn't relevant to the cards people are putting in them? Are people using magnetic fields to store their cards and I missed that memo or a hole in the ground an I also missed that memo? Would it not be cool to have a vector template for the most commonly used storage container for their MTG cards so people could get custom art printed on their MTG storage container?",

            "I'm assuming you're talking about on Arena?\n\nWithout Slickshot Showoff, the deck is still positive winrate in BO1. Granted, it's probably like (I don't know the actual figures, sue me) 55% as opposed to 60%, but it still works. Don't get me wrong;, you're right. Slickshot is the best creature in the deck by a significant margin. It's just worth noting that Electrostatic Infantry and Khenra Spellspear aren't *bad* cards. They're just bad in *comparison* to Slickshot.\n\nHell, people are hitting mythic with lists that include even the bad red-aggro cards like Phoenix Chick and Shock.\n\nBudget go brrr.",

            "This kicks so much ass dude",
            "Now that the big day has come and gone, we can finally share our wedding invitations with this sub! My husband and I are tremendous MtG fans (and in fact spent a great deal of our wedding weekend slinging spells with our wedding party, who are also our playgroup), so we thought it most fitting to celebrate our favorite game with our favorite people.\n\nI designed the booster packaging, card fronts, and backs (which are a nod to the anime movie Your Name - we walked down the aisle to Katawaredoki by RADWIMPS), and we worked with the folks at\u00a0[Board Games Maker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/)\u00a0to format it correctly. We made sure to include a custom Treasure token for our Magic-playing friends, though we knew a bunch of our family members might be left scratching their heads haha. We received a bunch of texts from friends saying they've sleeved the Treasure tokens and are using them in play, which is just the highest compliment we could be paid. We were both incredibly pleased by how it all turned out - the cards even smelled like a freshly cracked pack!\n\nWe sent these to our invitees in a green bubble mailer with cardboard backings so they wouldn't bend in transit, along with a customized note for each couple/friend/family unit. We were JUST on the cusp of the envelope counting as a letter, so we thankfully only had to pay extra for non-machinable mail!\n\nAll together, the packs cost just shy of $5 a unit to print (we made 65 of them), and about $2 to send. It was a bit on the spendy side for invites, but we were really happy that these set the tone for a relaxed, playful, fun wedding celebration.\n\nHappy to share any insights from this process for anyone who is interested in doing something similar! I had a ton of fun putting these together - I'd say designing these, cracking open the first pack, sending these to our friends and hearing all their elated and excited feedback was one of the best parts of our planning process. :)",

Although I like that they aren't too specific, they're not covered in Magic logos or characters, and the overall design has the common tcg style of an art box and a text box, but otherwise the design is very unique - clearly inspired by Magic but not being overtly themed that way, very classy.",
