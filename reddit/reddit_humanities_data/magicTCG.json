        "content": "This is a place for asking simple questions that might not deserve their own thread. For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.\n\nWe encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.\n\n**Rules Questions**\n\nRules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).\n\n**Deckbuilding Questions**\n\nIf you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.\n\nAdditionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as \"what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?\", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions**\n\n> _I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?_\n\nDon't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call \"The List\".\n\nYou can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website. For example, the contents of The List for Streets of New Capenna boosters can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14).\n\n> _My foil card has a shooting start symbol over the bottom left. I can't find anything about it online._\n\nAll old-bordered foils have the shooting star symbol. Most sites that display card images just overlay a generic foil graphic over all foil cards, which doesn't include the shooting star. Your card is normal.",

They are less crowded/touristy than Amsterdam and only take 30 mins by train)\n* Restaurant tips/requests\n\nEnjoy your time!",

            "I wasn't convinced until I saw the art, and learned about the concept of the plane: a demon bound to never leave a house, so it expanded the house until it devoured the whole plane. That's rad.",
            "i think it looks pretty good, but why does it need 80' tv?",
            "People bitched about Neon Dynasty being futuristic until it came out and was one of the best sets.",
            "It's so funny to me how at one point they didn't want to do D&D books because they thought it would dilute the Magic brand.",
            "It's interesting how this brings Universes Beyond sets closer to the magic main set flavor. Because Duskmourn is pretty much the same setting as Stranger Things.",
            "I wasn't too keen on the idea of an \"80s aesthetic\" the way it was described in the original announcement. There's still a little bit of that in what we've seen so far - stuff like the TV screens and other electronics - but there's also a lot more going on that I didn't initially expect.\n\nTo me, a lot of the vibe feels closer to an \"80s kids movie that probably wasn't appropriate for kids\" type of horror. By that I mean movies like Willow, Neverending Story, Legend, Labyrinth, and Dark Crystal. It's like there's one layer where the scary evil is actually kinda cheesy but a second layer where the horror is actually unnerving in the context of that world.",
            "I think malleability is the life blood of any franchise, but with Magic it's especially so because they have to assume Magic will exist forever. I'm not saying you have to like it but how are people still surprised when the series takes these bold new aesthetic choices? I mean we JUST had a cowboy deck!",

            "The anti life gain on this is WAY easier to trigger than Stigma Lasher's, for those who keep bringing up Lasher. Lasher you can just bolt or block with any creature and the effect doesn't go off. This one has Haste and also triggers when it itself is damaged so your only option is to use removal that doesn't damage and never tap out."
