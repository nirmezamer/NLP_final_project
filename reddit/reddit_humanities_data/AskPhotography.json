I\u2019m really keen to get started with this camera but I\u2019ve bought a lens that I thought should fit but doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s an x-mount camera and this was listed on eBay as an x-mount lens. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m missing important info or being an idiot, please go easy on me! \n\nI would really appreciate help, there are a lot of codes and numbers I don\u2019t really understand \n\nThanks so much ",

            "Thats a vintage lens right there using fm mount I think. You need an x-mount adapter to fit that there",
            "There are adapters, but yes, Mirorrless Fujifilm has different mount than analog Fujifilm.",
            "First things first, do not leave you sensor out. Get a cap for the camera. Or leave a lens on. Youre just asking for dirt and grime to get on the sensor or worse for it to be fucked up.",
            "Photography subreddits about people not doing any research before posting are getting out of hand.",
            "The same reason why a Nikon F lens won't fit on a Nikon Z camera. Even if it's by the same manufacturer, it's a different mount.",
            "Why is there no cover on your sensor!?!\n\nNothing else matters until that gets done",
            "Oh ok the person I bought it from said it was an x mount, thank you! At least Im not being daft",
            "Thank you so much for this advice Ill try it later!",
            "Yep, this pic is killing me.",
            "I just took it off quickly to take the photo! It went immediately back on I promise and I wont do it again, but thank you anyway!"

            "1 is definitely most pleasing to my eyes. I think it's because of the contrast of the cooler hues in the smoke and dirt, etc with the red embers.",
            "Personally, #1. I like the contrast. 2 is also good though. I dint really like 3. Good photo BTW.",

            "I think the color version is way better. His jacket is pretty much the only white thing in the image when its in color- so that makes it catch the eye more. In the b&w version there are competing whites. \n\nAlso the colors are really warm and nice and the palette is simple. I think it works.",

            "Hard to say. New models keep coming out all the time. A few years back I wanted the a7iv, now I want the Z6iii.\n\nIf anything, maybe I would get a long super zoom (like an apsc 18-400) and shoot on that for a year or two (to figure things out) before wasting so much money on lenses that I don't use much.",

            "Really glad for your feedback. What a well considered answer. I definitely think that a lot of my feelings and worries would be countermanded a lot simply by shooting a lot more.",
            "Totally okay. I'm in the shallow end of Sony peeping at Fuji, but mostly the hype of the 100v.\n\nI'll stay strong.",
            "Thanks! It's really the definition of \"it's never too late to start over\" - it's the best choice I've made in a very long time, and for lack of a better word, it's super empowering. Like, I see a picture of the Joe Mazzulla going ham with the crowd, instead of getting overwhelmed and fumbling to get it right, now I can take into account his movement, the distance, and how I already set up my aperture and focus so when he's in that sweet spot, boom, it's all good, no more guessing. Best of luck to you!",
            "It will be the 17-70.\nBut I heard that this lens is huge so I suggest the all-in-one lens could be the sony 18-135. Its more compact, lighter and its sharpness is also fanstatic.",
            "I very much appreciate the feedback. I'm going to go all weekend with a little 20 mm F 2.8 on my Sony a6000, and we shall see.",
