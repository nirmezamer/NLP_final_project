            "I like the photo. I\u2019ve done some similar ones over the years! Only thing is change is using a different focal length or change camera angle to have the vehicle traffic fill more of the frame and either in post or on-site I\u2019d try to make sure the fence is level as it seems to be higher on the left side that the right if you look across the cross over point in the links.",

But otherwise, people will often just tell you something isn\u2019t as good as it could be because it\u2019s not how they would do it. \n\nI like this a lot. Had I taken this photo, I\u2019d put it up in my apartment in one of those borderless glass frames with the metal circle mounts lol, and be damn proud of it",

            "First, try to find another point without fence. Second, if not possible at all, try to focus further away from the fence."
