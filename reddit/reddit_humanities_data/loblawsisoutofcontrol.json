At this time, the approximate costs are looking to be up to $10k, so we are trying to find lawyers who will work with us for reduced pay. We can also break down the costs of the sticker fundraiser as well. We just need time as a team to put this together more than anything!",

            "Selling stickers to raise funds is a fantastic idea, and these designs are really cute! But honestly, I don't feel that they capture the true sentiment of how boycotters are really feeling at the moment. Not one sticker says**\"BOYCOTT LOBLAWS\"**.\n\nBillionaire tears is truly sweet, but personally, I really don't have anything against anyone being a billionaire. I am super angry though about the way in which some billionaires choose to run their businesses. Some of them intentionally screw people over to make their money.\n\nAdding some more stickers to this lot, that specifically encourage this Loblaws and its affiliates boycott could be considered a necessary step at this time, if we want to further spread the word, and grow this movement even more.",

At this point they're being so brazen with how much of a shitty, rotten organization they are that I'm surprised they haven't run an ad campaign about how we should all be LUCKY to shop at their stores.",
