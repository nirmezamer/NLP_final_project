So now we have a backyard I can comfortably do this in. \n\nI started tanning every other day and love it, only one problem. The neighbor who lives behind us saw me tanning while he was doing yard work. I noticed him looking over the fence a few times. No big deal. \n\nSo I think he catches on to my schedule and now every time I\u2019m tanning he\u2019s doing some yard work. I was thinking maybe a coincidence? I can\u2019t get upset if he\u2019s doing yard work right? Ignored the situation and brushed it off again. \n\nThe next day I went to tan again. Of course, he comes outside to do MORE yard work! At this point I\u2019m pissed so I confront him. He told me he wasn\u2019t trying to look as he needed to trim hedges. I told my husband about the situation and he went to talk to him about it. It ended up with a fight and now an ongoing conflict between them. I can no longer tan without my husband getting upset. I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut and ignored it. ",

            "There are TANNING bikinis that let the sun in so you end up with no tan lines. Up close you can tell they are transparent, but you could easily wear one of them and no one could tell its a tanning bikini from about 50 ft away. Buy one of those, cheaper than a fence or landscaping. I cant remember where I got one, but we live on a lake and neighbors are about 500 ft away so could never tell that my suit is basically transparent.",

The living room window is right next to the couch where she will lay naked and the window looks out to a walkway about 12 apartments are connected to. She gets upset when I\u2019ve mentioned it seems she wants people to see but she says no one can see in. So I walk out naked even further from the window and she goes OMG put some clothes on!! \u2026I thought they couldn\u2019t see in?"
