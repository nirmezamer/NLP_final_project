        "content": "Soooo my partner and I thought it would be hot to post some anonymous spicy pics of me on an anonymous porn site to see how men react. It was going well until one of them implored my age, we told him, and he didn't believe us. To be clear, I am in my late 20s. I have always looked young for my age but I didn't think people would mistake me for a minor.\n\n  \nMore genuinely creepy men began asking my age and when asked to guess they'd usually say 16/17. Fucking gross. \n\nAnyways my partner and I went to post again and the site said we were banned for violating the underage policy. Ummm wtf? I am a grownass adult.\n\n  \nI am freaked out, someone obviously reported the pics to the site, what if someone reports them to the authorities? Imagine being investigated and having to explain yourself \"hey I know that's not a kid, because it's me.\" Embarrassing af! I hope nothing becomes of it.",

            "I wonder how the authorities would go about verifying that you really are the one in the picture . \nProbably a pretty straightforward process, but that would make the whole thing even more unpleasant.",
            "Back in the day an adult actress Little Lupe ended up going to court to exonerate a man charged with possession of CP when it was actually her. Pretty similar scenario that went all the way. It worked and he wasn't charged but this can theoretically go that far. If that site's blocked you two on grounds of being underage (which they honestly believe) then I'd imagine technically they should have reported it to the authorities as well.",

            "For what it's worth I deliver grocery shopping in England and we have to perform the Challenge 25 age check at the doorstep for anything age restricted, just like a cashier would at the till, and we HAVE to because secret shoppers. A couple of years back I asked a young girl who answered the door, maybe 13 or 14 at the most, to go get her parents because of the vodka. She was in her 30s and had her ID in hand already. You're not alone in looking younger than your years.",
            "Well, a woman wants to post naked pictures and it gets ruined by the weirdos.",
            "Omg I have BEEN that girl, literally this exact scenario. I was told to get my parents  I was 23",
            "Ah yeah. To be fair I guess whoever actually reported it had good intentions. But yeah, lots of weirdos who were disappointed I was a legal adult "

I haven't felt happy for a long time and I'm sick of fighting just to end up miserable. This wasn't something I planned in advance. I found myself in a situation where the opportunity presented itself, and I almost took it. I don't have many people in my life I can talk to. Everyone has their own struggles and I don't want to weigh people down with my problems. I've been to doctors for years for help with my mental health and all I get is pushed around the system to different people and treated like a nuisance.",
