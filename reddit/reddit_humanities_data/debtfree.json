        "content": "Hello everyone! I hope you guys are all doing well. I really need your advice and input on this situation I have found myself in. I am 22 years old now. In 2020, I graduated from high school and started college that Fall semester at a highly ranked private university that was out of state, my dream school. As we all know, 2020 was a crazy year for everyone due to the pandemic. It was a very hard time for me because it was my first time away from home, alone in a new environment where I didn\u2019t know anybody. I was the first person in my family to go away for college, so I didn't know what to expect and the transition was very hard on my mental health. Ultimately, my first semester I ended up getting depressed and I developed an eating disorder, where I over ate to ignore my sadness and even gained 40 pounds. I was so down, I struggled to perform daily tasks like showering or brushing my teeth. This was so weird to me because I had never struggled with my mental health prior to this. To this day, the only person I have discussed the difficulties I experienced in college is with the therapist I started talking to about 7 months ago.\n\nWith all the internal struggles I was dealing with, I did horrible academically for the first two years at university. A whopping 1.7 gpa overall. SMH. After my first year, I was placed on academic probation, and after my second year of still struggling, my financial aid was taken away. I found out on move in day of my 3rd year that I was no longer eligible for financial aid. \n\nThis is where my dilemma now comes into play. Because I didn't receive financial aid for that semester, there was a balance of about $30,000 on my student account. Instead of just dropping out and going back home like I should have done, I stayed on campus and continued to take the classes I had registered for that semester. I'm surprised I wasn't dropped from my classes since that balance hadn\u2019t been paid from the beginning (Still went on to fail those classes as well). \n\nI was in denial and did not want to accept that I needed help and that I wasn't doing myself any good by just trying to continue on in my education. I dropped out of college after I completed the Fall 2022 semester, and I worked full time at a fast food restaurant in the same city. I would get emails from the university every few months about my balance and I would just ignore it (being stupid).\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I decided to finally give the billing office at my old university a call to try and see how I can solve the issue of my large balance, which due to interest had reached about $43,000. I was told that my only two options were to pay the balance in full or to pay in 3 monthly installments ($15,000 every month). I told her I couldn't afford either option and I was told there was no other option for me to solve the issue. I was told the balance would go to collections if I didn't find a way to pay it off, but I really couldn't afford either option. \n\nFast forward to January of this year, I was thinking about going back to college, applied to a different college, and have been admitted to the college! I am doing much better mentally, have been seeing a therapist regularly (best decision ever), and set to graduate in December 2026. I am so grateful to God that I have come out of this depression and that I now have my mind right to complete my education which has always been a dream of mine. \n\nFast forward again to about a month ago, I received an email saying that my balance has now reached $49,000, but now I qualify for a 24 month installment payment plan (a little over $2000 a month). I don't even make $2000 in a month, so I still can't afford to start to pay this balance off. I decided to give them a call again to request a plan that was more affordable for me, and I was told that the least I can pay monthly is $1000 a month, which I still can't afford right now. I will be graduating in about 2.5 years God willing, with a degree where I can get a job with a starting salary at around $70,000. But by that time, my balance would have probably reached around $70,000 - $80,000, and it will probably go to collections before it reaches that point.\n\nI am worried about so many things. I have made a lot of bad money decisions in my depressive state and my credit score is around 600, pretty low. How badly would this affect my credit if this goes to collections before I graduate with a decent job? I've also recently learned about wage garnishing, but it says online that it mostly happens with default student loans, alimony, and child support. Can I still get my wages garnished by a private university? I don't know what to do or where to start or how to start. How fucked am I? Will I ever get out of this? \n",

            "Good luck, man. I'm definitely no expert (trying to pay off debts myself) but not paying is just as bad as going to collections because that's still a mark on your payment history, which is one of the biggest factors that affect your credit. \n\nI've found that when going to collections, the collections companies are more forgiving as far as how much you can pay a month and I had one company completely wipe out the remainder of my balance after paying on time 6 months straight (about 25% of the balance remaining). You're young, and a dark mark on your credit for on-time payments will be wiped out before you know it. I think it hangs round for 7 years before it drops off. That'll give you time to graduate, get a good job, and start saving for a down payment on a house."

Set an alarm on your calendar for twice a year to remind you to call each of your cards and ask for a limit increase and/or a lower rate. \n\nWhy do you have so many cards? The problem with that is that you don\u2019t want to be closing accounts as they\u2019ll negatively affect your score and if you don\u2019t use them at all, eventually the credit card company will close it out on their own. I found this out the hard way when Discover closed my longest standing account for lack of use. It\u2019s just a lot of cards to keep track of.",

            "The creditor only cares about two things: being paid as much if the outstanding balance as possible, and mitigating their risk. That\u2019s why they lowered your credit limit as soon as you told them about the hardship. That said, telling them you are experiencing the hardship is the only way to get help. \n\nWent through this process with Citi recently. Here\u2019s the process we followed: Called them before we missed a payment and explained the hardship we were facing, and that we intended to pay the balance is we could get some help. They explained we should call back after next statement date. (They can\u2019t legally advise you to miss a payment, so it\u2019s a subtle hint)\n\nYou wait until you\u2019ve missed a payment. You\u2019ll have a late fee added to your balance, but they won\u2019t report it to the credit bureaus until it\u2019s 30+ days late. Call them back a few days after the missed payment. You want to get through to the Client Focus team. Their number is 866-972-1371, but even if you call it you\u2019ll have to ask the person who answers for this team. (And remind them about the financial hardship) Depending on the circumstances, they may offer two options:\nOption one to bring the account current over a few months which you won\u2019t be able to afford.\nOr, a long term balance payoff program, with zero interest. If you accept, you\u2019ll have to agree to close your account, reported as \u201ccustomer requested closure\u201d, but if you eventually pay the full balance they will then report \u201cpaid in full\u201d to the bureaus. It sucks to have to close the account and it will impact your credit history length, as well as utilization, but you will have a very affordable payment and avoid late fees, collections, charge off. Ours was 60 months. Zero interest paid. Made sense for us. \n\nTrying to pay it forward. Hope this helps.",
