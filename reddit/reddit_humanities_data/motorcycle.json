            "Days before the invasion happened there was a Ukrainian on a KLR 650 group or sub talking about getting his bike ready. It was sad because he seemed oblivious that a war was imminent.  Like he was in denial that Russia would actually wreck his country. Obviouslynobody forsaw this long ordeal.  I hope he rides free again soon.",
            "I stand with Ukrainian and Russian people . Not their corrupt leaders . This would have never happened if not for Nato encroaching on Russian borders . Russia and China are powder kegs waiting to happen . It ain't worth  everyone on the planet getting nuked . US wouldn't like it either if Russia and China put nuke bases in Cuba or at the Mexican border . This is basically the US's fault for poking the Bear in order to hide Biden's corruption in the Ukraine .And blaming Russia for  collusion in US election  that was entirely hillary's  piss dossier  bullshit . Zelensky is an installed WEF Puppet just like turdeau and obama, macron etc  .If theyre involved i definately don't support their bug eating asses . Its a shame innocent civilians have to suffer this One World Order corruption. If Nato would have stayed out of Ukraine there would still be peace .",
