Breathe deep, humble yourself, and realize that waiting 5-10 seconds won't make a difference in your day and could save a life \n\nJust saw someone honk at a car yielding to a man with a blind walking stick.

Then he tried to go around me and almost hit the guy in the crosswalk.\n\nYou'd think being that high up you could at least see what was going on in the road.",

Pay attention.\n\nAll you people waiting at the green light letting the pedestrian cross\u2026good job.",
            "I like running on the sidewalks around my neighborhood.  I appreciate the drivers who make a safe path for me.  Twice today drivers were more cautious than I need.  Was not necessary but appreciated.  Have had days when I'm shaming drivers cutting me off in the crosswalk.  I'm not talking about stopping in the crosswalk.  I'm talking I would have been hospitalized if I had entered the crosswalk.",
            "Also annoying: honking at a car that can't turn right on red because of oncoming traffic. Or: honking at a car that has to yield to oncoming cars, when making a left turn.",
            "Amen. And DO NOT ANGRILY ZOOM AROUND THE CAR AHEAD OF YOU.\n\nYou may be ramming right into the person crossing in front of the car ahead of you, who you don't see.",
            "And then the people honking turn right and end up waiting at another stop light... No difference at all",
            "I did it once in error. I was the 2nd car in line waiting to turn right. As it turned out, there was a pedestrian across the street  crossing in the crosswalk across 4 lanes of traffic toward us. The pedestrian was blocked from my visibility due to the car in front of me. I waited a good while trying to figure out why the car in front wasn\u2019t turning. The driver was looking down (presumably at a phone) so I thought they literally didn\u2019t know the light changed. I didn\u2019t realize they were waiting for a pedestrian to cross 4 lanes of traffice toward us. Literally 1 second after I honked, the pedestrian came into my view as the entered the last lane closest to us and I instant felt like a turd. But, also, consider my patience that the amount of time I waited before honking was how long it takes a pedestrian to walk 3 lanes of traffic. \n\nSo yeah, sometimes people are disgusting and selfish, and sometimes they just don\u2019t have visibility and think people are texting at stop lights and not paying attention."
