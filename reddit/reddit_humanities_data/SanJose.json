        "content": "I've noticed over the last decade, condos have barely appreciated or even gone down. Take a look at this listing: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/150-Saratoga-Ave-UNIT-320-Santa-Clara-CA-95051/19601049\\_zpid/? It's a remodeled 3/2 1442 sq feet condo in Cupertino schools but only got 842K.  \nA nearby remodeled 3/2 1506 sq feet SFH with the same Cupertino schools netted 2.933M https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/371-Manly-Ct-Santa-Clara-CA-95051/19601561\\_zpid/!\n\nPeople will say yeah but the condo has HOA cost and the SFH has a yard and you can build an ADU on it.\n\nI'd say sure, but would you be willing to pay over 2M additional for that privilege? No amount of HOA fees will make up a 2M difference. Is there no love for condos?",

            "In a condo you own the right to live in that space, you don't own the land or the building, just the space.   In SFH you own the land, the structure, everything.  \n\nSo, in one case you own a right to something, in the other you actually own something.",
            "I have a 3/2 condo with a small backyard that I bought 11 years ago. I pay 1450 mortgage because I refinanced when the rates were low. My condo value has roughly doubled in that time from 415 to 750-800 now. I\u2019m happy with it. The low cost helps me live a much better life than if I was killing myself to pay for a SFH mortgage.",
            "Condos don't appreciate in value as quickly and HOA fees can add a ton of costs to the total ownership. I bought and sold a condo and I'm so happy to be out from my $700+ monthly HOA fee. \n\nThey're not a bad option for someone looking to buy and build equity in real estate but they're not great as investments and have high costs due to HOA",
            "Living with other people and making key decisions with a group I don't know well... ongoing fees, although sfh have those too... plus the pandemic showed us that congregate settings can be unsafe and the wfh people can go anywhere\u00a0",
            "Politicians keep saying more homes but I would argue we need more condos.  Not everyone is going to be able to afford a single-family in the bay area.",
            "Buying a condo is a lifestyle choice not an investment decision.  If you think you can live there forever, definitely do it. It will save you money (housing is a cost in the end of the day) in the long run and provide a comfortable lifestyle and give you less worries about paying it off in the future.  \n\nA SFH will appreciate more in the long run, but if you plan to stay in that SFH forever you will never realize that gain.",
            "Covid really pushed people towards larger homes and more space. \n\nCondos had already lagged SFH for appreciation so that added additional pricing pressure.",
            "Old condos in this area also has parking challenges. High rise condo with enough parking ane other facilities can ve attractive but low story old condos in this area are not that attractive. And still HOA is too high.",
            "I'll pay almost anything not to share walls/buildings with other people.",
            "OP, point taken that condos are significantly cheaper than townhomes and SFHs, but there are many downsides that justify the cost of upgrading. You don\u2019t own the land or structure of a condo. Depending on the layout, you may share multiple walls with neighbors (not to mention upstairs/downstairs neighbors as well). No garage for tools/cars/projects. No yard. Less overall privacy. Some SFH and townhomes may have an HOA, but every condo requires a HOA fee due to the shared building\n\nIf it works for your budget and lifestyle, more power to you. But for many people, the downsides push them toward townhomes and SFHs and that is what is driving the slower appreciation"

There are homeless all along there.  I remember when it wasn't too bad.  But it got worse during covid and then the homeless moved into the Milpitas area and I decided to avoid it.  Too many crazy ones.",

            "I did it once in error. I was the 2nd car in line waiting to turn right. As it turned out, there was a pedestrian across the street  crossing in the crosswalk across 4 lanes of traffic toward us. The pedestrian was blocked from my visibility due to the car in front of me. I waited a good while trying to figure out why the car in front wasn\u2019t turning. The driver was looking down (presumably at a phone) so I thought they literally didn\u2019t know the light changed. I didn\u2019t realize they were waiting for a pedestrian to cross 4 lanes of traffice toward us. Literally 1 second after I honked, the pedestrian came into my view as the entered the last lane closest to us and I instant felt like a turd. But, also, consider my patience that the amount of time I waited before honking was how long it takes a pedestrian to walk 3 lanes of traffic. \n\nSo yeah, sometimes people are disgusting and selfish, and sometimes they just don\u2019t have visibility and think people are texting at stop lights and not paying attention."
