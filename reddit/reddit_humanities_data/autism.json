        "content": "ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy is one of our most commonly discussed topics here, and one of the most emotionally charged. In an effort to declutter the sub and reduce rule-breaking posts, this will serve as the master thread for ABA discussion.\n\nThis is the place for asking questions, sharing personal experiences, linking to blog posts or scientific articles, and posting opinions. If you\u2019re a parent seeking alternatives to ABA, please give us a little information about your child. Their age and what goals you have for them are usually enough.\n\nPlease keep it civil. Abusive or harassing comments will be removed.\n\n**What is ABA?** From [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/aba-therapy):\n\n>ABA therapy attempts to modify and encourage certain behaviors, particularly in autistic children. It is not a cure for ASD, but it can help individuals improve and develop an array of skills.\n\n>This form of therapy is rooted in behaviorist theories. This assumes that reinforcement can increase or decrease the chance of a behavior happening when a similar set of circumstances occurs again in the future.\n\nFrom our wiki: [**How can I tell whether a treatment is reputable? Are there warning signs of a bad or harmful therapy?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/wiki/warningsigns)",

            "I try to stay silent on most topics on here, because I personally do not have autism but I am  a mother of an autistic 3yr old. And the amount of \"You need to start ABA immediately! Every day without it your child suffers\" I recieved from his pediatrician and developmental pediatrician caused me so much anxiety. I started the search only to find out my insurance doesnt cover it and it would be $700 a week before I reached my deductible. \n\nIm so happy looking back it was so expensive and i had time to do research and find out more. This is still the mainline treatment and is pushed. My son was only diagnosed 7 months ago.",
            "My 15 yr old son was diagnosed about a month ago.  When I asked his neuropsychologist what was available to help him if needed.  I did mention that I was not interested in pursuing ABA.  She responded that she knew there was a conflict between ABA and the adult autistic community so she did not recommend it.  This seemed to be a step in a positive direction.",
            "Not only does ABA instill learned helplessness and trauma, but it also stunts communication skills. Most ABA simplifies language (for example \"Say \"cookie\" to get the cookie\" would become \"cookie?\") and, moreover, ABA focuses only on operant conditioning. This means that the child isn't allowed to do more complex cognition, like language learning that isn't on the level of dogs. It's dehumanizing if you think about it.",
            "My doctor describes ABA as \"teaching a patient how to hide their autism, so the people around them can feel less annoyed by it\" and then she goes on to say, those people aren't her patients, I am, so fuck em. \n\nI have a great doctor.",
            "So when I was a kid I went to therapy for social skills. How to maintain eye contact, how to detect sarcasm, how to react appropriately to different social cues. What those different social cues were. I never heard it called ABA but now I'm wondering if that's what it was.",
            "I have an 8 year old Autistic son. He can say some words but at times I don\u2019t understand what he is saying or what he needs. I think that is what causes a lot of his meltdowns. He has sensory issues with food and sticks to his safe foods (which are pretty unhealthy), and I am also having a hard time potty training him. His teachers, pediatricians, case workers, and family members have been pushing aba therapy on me. I\u2019ve been real hesitant because I went to one session years ago when he was first diagnosed and it just didn\u2019t settle right with me so I never went back. Now I\u2019m reading all of these articles and comments on here and I am going to be clear with my intentions of not putting my son through that. His pediatrician gave me a referral for aba therapy and a pediatric neurologist. So I am just going to tell her no on the aba and do my own research on the pediatric neurologist. I guess what I wanted to ask is what therapies or other ideas might you guys suggest? I need help communicating with him and vice versa. He already has a speech therapist at his school but I\u2019m wondering what more I could do to better communicate (sign language perhaps)? I also wanted to help him with his eating habits and with his potty training. I am a single mom and have limited resources so any help would be greatly appreciated. :)",
            "As an Autistic teen, I think ABA is stupid. 1. It treats the child as if they have no choice, or as if they are stupid/incapable. Now I understand it's a disability and some people aren't as capable as others, but we are not stupid, or any younger than others, and im tired of people seeing it that way.\n2. It revolves around alot of un-consented touch, and tbh, it sacres me. The amount of touching they do is somewhat gross, and I know some Autistics like touch, some REALLY Don't, personally, I only like affectionate touch, and I need to be able to move aswell during the touch. I know this will be different for many Autistic people, and that is 100 ok. But its kinda creepy how a lot of the \"rewards\" are touching said Autistic child.\n3. Its quite similar to the \"cUrE aUtiSiM\" thing. And i do not need fricking curing I tell you right now, and that is unreasonable and stupid, but for some reason, alot of usually bad charities or autisim moms want a cure. And anyway, my final opinion is: ABA therapy is wrong, and it isn't really helping the child. I recommend looking at YouTube videos from autistic adults, as they probably will explain it better than me.",
            "I really appreciate containing these discussions. Thanks for this.",
            "I'm 17 and started aba therapy it was cool at first I basically had a friend to hangout and do puzzles eith while my mom worked...then after a week they took her away because basically they wanted someone that could fix my \"problems\". They took away my friend and my case manager and haven't even texted us since and it's been almost two weeks. I've begun getting worked up and mad and screaming at my animals. They took away the person that was supposed to help me why? \"Because the distance\" the therapist even said it wasn't the distance. Two days in a row I've had outbursts that leave me crying from anger now that I have no one to hangout with. \ud83e\udd21 idc I'm refusing to continue you dont get to switch my therapists around because of kids in school I'm not gonna go through that again.",
            "I am a pediatric occupational therapist assistant. 99% of my caseload are autistic children and young adults. I would never ever recommend ABA. I have a client I have been working with for years. He started ABA and they decided his stimmimg needed to stop (humming, and spinning wheels on toy cars) he now hits his chin repeatedly. I let him have stim breaks in between our handwriting and other tasks and he doesn\u2019t self harm during my sessions because I let him self regulate. It\u2019s heartbreaking to know how overvalued ABA is compared to occupational therapy."
