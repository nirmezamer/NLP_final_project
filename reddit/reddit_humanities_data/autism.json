If you\u2019re a parent seeking alternatives to ABA, please give us a little information about your child. Their age and what goals you have for them are usually enough.\n\nPlease keep it civil. Abusive or harassing comments will be removed.\n\n**What is ABA?** From [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/aba-therapy):\n\n>ABA therapy attempts to modify and encourage certain behaviors, particularly in autistic children. It is not a cure for ASD, but it can help individuals improve and develop an array of skills.\n\n>This form of therapy is rooted in behaviorist theories. This assumes that reinforcement can increase or decrease the chance of a behavior happening when a similar set of circumstances occurs again in the future.\n\nFrom our wiki: [**How can I tell whether a treatment is reputable?

            "I try to stay silent on most topics on here, because I personally do not have autism but I am  a mother of an autistic 3yr old. And the amount of \"You need to start ABA immediately! Every day without it your child suffers\" I recieved from his pediatrician and developmental pediatrician caused me so much anxiety. I started the search only to find out my insurance doesnt cover it and it would be $700 a week before I reached my deductible. \n\nIm so happy looking back it was so expensive and i had time to do research and find out more. This is still the mainline treatment and is pushed. My son was only diagnosed 7 months ago.",
            "ABA took me from being non verbal to being verbal as a kid, HOWEVER it was at a quite high price. The adults who surrounded me didn't know any better so when the kindergarten I went to suggested that I was put in ABA therapy, since I was the only autistic child who wouldn't participate in any activity, just sit facing the wall without speaking, they complied. Trouble sleeping, vivid nightmares and surreal dreams, low self esteem and general insecurity are some of the symptoms I started having during ABA and these last to this day. I am in my 30s, I am verbal, even though I still have a speech issue which non autistics call an \"accent\" and this explanation seems feasible since I've lived in several countries and it's mostly attributed to be being foreigner there, but having an \"accent\" in my own native language caused endless bullying in school. \n\nThese days I am more comfortable being always the \"different\" person in the room and every time I hear a \"oh, you have an accent! Where are you from?\" I immediately tell whoever asks that this is not a foreigner accent but a speech difference that I've been unable to correct even going to many, many speech therapy sessions throughout life and mostly caused by ,e being autistic and spending my first years as a nonverbal individual. It informs them about something very important about me and it educates them as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have any intention at all to have any kid of my own, but if I did and it were autistic, I would never put it in ABA therapy, since I do think the questionable benefits are not worth it.",
            "My mother is forcing me to go through ABA even though I'm almost 17 years old. I have talked with her about the autistic adult community's views about ABA and she basically said that our opinion is nonsense. \n\nIs there any way I can get out of therapy without her consent? I'm almost a young adult yet I am being given the \"little kid\" version of ABA.\n\nUpdate: I'm not doing ABA anymore :D It's autonomy time! I checked with my psychiatrist and even confronted my ABA \"therapist\" and I'm finally free! My mom is now respecting my decision to do normal therapy after talking with my psychiatrist and even turned down my psychiatrist's \"accidental\" autism treatment offers in other clinics (I'm don't know what to call it in english so I'm going to say \"autism treatment\")",
            "Hi all,\n\nReading more about it, I realized I was forced into ABA as a child.\n\nLike, holy shit. I'm not even sure if my biofamily knew I was autistic, but they (and my first two schools) forced me to not stim, to talk, to look people in the eyes, wear bad clothes, eat bad feeling food, etc... all of it. I wasn't a 'meltdown' child. I was a 'shutdown' type. I go catatonic, basically.\n\nI'm 'unlearning' all the harm done to me as a child, but it's hard to let myself stim or be non-verbal because I feel like I'll get in trouble if I don't force myself to be 'sociable'.  \n\n\nEdit, 4 months later: Turns out I def have ADHD and maybe autism on top of it lmao. Still very anxious about life but EMDR and talk therapy has been amazing and I can actually ride the bus by myself!!! Even a year ago I couldn't step outside by myself! *It gets better, y'all. Life gets better.* <3",
            "As a former ABA therapist, I don't agree with the principles of that therapy. I do believe OT and other therapies to be helpful.\n\nABA approaches things from a very NT perspective only. It inherently asks these children to change everything about their autism. They can't stim, they can't utilize echolalia, just a million things that are wrong wrong wrong. Even the companies that use silence in place of \"no\", it's still coming across as \"wrong\" to the child.\n\nI helped a 9 year old learn how to cross the street safely, brush his teeth, use the bathroom independently, and try new healthier foods without it turning into a stressful situation. That was good.\n\nBut I also had to teach these kids not to use their natural comforting instincts - why? Because it would make NTs comfortable. Fuck that. I refused to prioritize NTs over these innocent, struggling kids and quit. Im so glad I did.\n\nSome of the principles of ABA that are good are found in other therapies. ABA is old-fashioned and not as *long-term* beneficial as most other therapies. It's time we move on.",
            "My 15 yr old son was diagnosed about a month ago.  When I asked his neuropsychologist what was available to help him if needed.  I did mention that I was not interested in pursuing ABA.  She responded that she knew there was a conflict between ABA and the adult autistic community so she did not recommend it.  This seemed to be a step in a positive direction.",
            "Not only does ABA instill learned helplessness and trauma, but it also stunts communication skills. Most ABA simplifies language (for example \"Say \"cookie\" to get the cookie\" would become \"cookie?\") and, moreover, ABA focuses only on operant conditioning. This means that the child isn't allowed to do more complex cognition, like language learning that isn't on the level of dogs. It's dehumanizing if you think about it.",
            "My doctor describes ABA as \"teaching a patient how to hide their autism, so the people around them can feel less annoyed by it\" and then she goes on to say, those people aren't her patients, I am, so fuck em. \n\nI have a great doctor.",
            "I took an Intro to Applied Behavior Analysis course last semester because I wanted to find out what exactly ABA therapists were supposed to do. The most irritating thing I learned in that class is that ABA therapy teaches children that coping by removing yourself from an uncomfortable situation is considered a form of negative reinforcement. Here's a line from a study guide my instructor wrote:\n\n>_Escape & Negative Reinforcement (A child does not like sitting at his table in school so he requests to take his work to the office when it is time to sit down and do work...His teacher always allows him to do this. This is an example of Escape and the child is negatively reinforced)._\n\nHere's my favorite line from a lecture:\n\n>_The most accurate analogy I can give you for ABA therapy is training a dog to stop barking whenever it sees other dogs._\n\nAnd my favorite hypothetical from a textbook:\n\n>_Justin is training his 6-year-old sister Sally to jump any time he claps..._\n\nYes, they use the word \"training\" in reference to children many times. Yes, dogs are used as examples quite often in the textbook.",
            "Ok then. I'll just put my own personal, emotionally charged anecdote that forever haunted me about ABA.    \nNot even of me. I was helping a customer with high-needs (possibly autistic, but neurodivergent at least), he was buying a ticket to my aquarium.   \nIn the entry vestibule, there were only us three: Me, my customer, and his attendant. While his attendant was paying, I asked the customer (who looked very excited to be coming to the aquarium)   \n\"Are you excited to see the fishes?\"  \nAnd he beamed, held his fists, and repeated my phrase *\"excited to see fish, excited to see fish, excited to see fish\"* while moving very obviously excitedly. He wasn't even talking loudly, almost whispering to himself.      \nUntil his attendant gave him the \"calm\" hand signal, and the customer went back to a stoic stance.   \n   \nWhen he repeated what I had said, and how he was doing it, I really understood clearly and could see how happy he was. And I was (selfishly) proud that it was the words I used that triggered that happy stim. I just. Can't explain how happy he was in words, but it was clearer than I'd seen in anyone.   \nPerhaps from learning about how I and other autistics/neurodivergents express emotions, I could finally recognize it. I makes me cry when I think about it, he was just so damn happy. There was no one else around, so even if you were forced to care what people think (when you are going to a \"fun\" place - & we're a big city no one would bat an eye if they saw an adult acting like he did; and we get a lot of nt \"nerds\" too so it wouldn't be out of place), there was no one there to care.     \nAnd his attendant calmed him down.   \n    \n   \nHe would have \"calmed himself down\" in three seconds once he got that joy out of his system. Let us feel our emotions the way we feel them.   \n   \nk that exhausts any passionate comment I'll have to make thank you.  \n   \nE ABA not AAC, the latter is amazing"

            "I love listening to old folk music of any kind. Idk why I'm like this but my brain just can't get enough of it. It's fun and interesting to me, it feeds my imagination. I love shanties, festive songs, music from the 1700s, European medieval music, music from ancient times, folk music from around the world. It's all mesmerizing to me. But I also just like hearing national anthems, the older the better. I discovered this man who studies and goes in depth into music more focused in the Mediterranean and Middle East and it is so cool, I love it, I learn so much from this guy. He's brilliant.

        "content": "I\u2019m recently diagnosed and was undiagnosed for 19 years, the way we figured it out was a long confusing process, and one thing i\u2019ve noticed is that my parents (both in their 50s) don\u2019t say \u201cautism\u201d or \u201cautistic\u201d most of the time when they\u2019re talking about it. they\u2019ll mostly say \u201con the spectrum\u201d referring to my autism and it\u2019s like they\u2019re dancing around the word, like it\u2019s taboo or something. is it a generational thing? why do they seem uncomfortable just saying \u201cautism\u201d?",

            "There\u2019s probably stigma associated with the word autism for your parents , that\u2019s the only thing I can think of",
            "My boss, who\u2019s like 26 (so not old) tiptoes around it a lot. He\u2019s gotten A LOT better though. \u201cBecause of your.. you know\u201d and \u201cbecause of your\u2026. *autism*\u201d is usually how he says it. But at least he\u2019s saying it. It\u2019s a work in progress",
            "I don\u2019t really have an answer. But I was talking to my child (late teens autistic) and they told me that they had met a new person today. That person (20s) asked my child whether they were \u201con the spectrum\u201d; it turns out that person was autistic too. So from this interaction it\u2019s not necessarily a generational or even NT thing. \n\nAs autists we get to choose what preferred term we use to describe ourselves. Personally I don\u2019t care what term is used by others so long as it\u2019s said with kindness. It must be quite confusing for NTs when we can\u2019t even decide on a single preferred term amongst ourselves!",
            "So, you should ask your parents specifically. \n\nThere is a main old reason, and a main new reason. \n\nIn the past, Autism was basically only diagnosed in males who also had an intellectual disability and would likely be permanently disabled. So, an autism diagnosis was a pretty negative thing. Especially with how society decided to deal with anyone disabled. (I'm simplifying a LOT, look up some history if you need more context).\n\nNewer main reason is socially appropriate verbiage is moving to people aren't autistic, they have Autism Spectrum Disorder. Then everything else is slang, and there's not a right or wrong way, but without looking it up, everyone knows there's a socially correct way, but not which ways are the socially acceptable ones. \n\nHope this kind of answers it a little bit. I cut out a lot of context.",
            "there are two different motivations that i can think of:\n\n1. magical thinking: they feel that if they avoid saying the word \"autism\" then they prevent it from being true. some people actually think like this. it's wild.\n\nor\n\n2. misguided notion of respect/deference towards parents of non-verbal or otherwise higher-needs autistic folk. they don't want to arouse their anger by suggesting that your difficulties might cohabit the same broad continuum that their kids' difficulties do.",
            "It's absolutely because of the stigma. I've observed people of all adult ages say it, and it always feels like a euphamism for autistic. I think it's based on the misconception that the spectrum is a line from \"very autistic\" to \"slightly autistic\", so by saying someone is \"on the spectrum\", it's a polite way of saying someone has autistic traits without labeling them as something that can be incredibly stigmatizing. (Basically in NT culture, it's rude to call someone autistic, and showing a lot of social vulnerability to call oneself autistic.)",
            "I don't think this is an *adults* thing, I think this is a *your parents* thing.  They know the answer, and you can ask them.",
            "My boomer parents do the same. They explicitly told me it\u2019s because being on the spectrum isn\u2019t as bad as being autistic. So\u2026yeah.",
            "They're being more vague out of politeness to differentiate you from those with higher support needs is my best guess."
