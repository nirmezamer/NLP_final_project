            "Gotta love the dictator, whose one over arching goal was to reestablish Russian Empire limits and bring them back to  super power status..... visiting North Korea to grovel for their 50+ year old shells that their frontline troops continuously complain about.",
            "Ka-29 gone according to Fighterbomber",
            "Just based on the huge reaction of the Russians to the ATACMS strike it seems like it was extremely successful so that is good news.",
            "I wondered why we got so many \"concerned\" comments all of a sudden, until I realized the megathread got refreshed. I get that dumb persistence is a classic Russian/Soviet propaganda technique but surely they would get that, at least in this sub, they are wasting their time. Surely.\u00a0",
            "So, sounds like North Korea plans to send troops (engineers it seems like to start) to Ukraine within a month. Are they being used as PMCs or is this an attempt to draw the US\u2019s ire or more concessions? It is certainly an escalation. \n\nNot sure how the West will handle this. Russia must have made some substantial offers to modernize or increase North Korea\u2019s existing technological capabilities to get them to agree to this. This seems like a suicide pact.",
            "Romania is donating another patriot system. Decision was made .. just now.\n\n(Currently only Romanian news outlets broke the news ).",
            "Interesting to see NATO spec 203mm being fired out of Soviet era 2S7 guns, I wonder where they're getting the Ammo from. Should still be stocks around given the list of M110 operators but I wonder if there's any active production lines.",
            "Hi guys, please click my dubious link that draws moral equivalences and bad faith bullshit between two very different conflicts.   \n\nI am a serious person and not in any way a fucking moron.",
            "Is it just me, or is there less first person footage coming out lately? There's still a lot of drone footage and interviews, but it seems like there's way less helmet cam videos of raids etc.",
            "The opportunity for South Korea to change its stance on weapons deliveries is interesting. On one hand, the Yoon administration will certainly want to retaliate against Russia over the new pact with Pyongyang. South Korea has plenty of munitions and weapons systems that Ukraine would love to get its hands on.\n\nOn the other hand, the Yoon administration is unpopular and has limited political capital. The South Korean left is already representing this pact as proof that South Korea needs a non-aligned foreign policy, and the right may not want to give the opposition another issue to rally around. On top of that, the pact will only exacerbate the threat North Korea poses to the South, so the South will likely want to avoid significantly denting any of its stockpiles."
