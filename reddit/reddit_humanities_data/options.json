            "Often times, the bid of call/put credit spread goes in the negative. If I understand it correctly, this is what they call \"arbitrage\". Robinhood doesnt let you capitalize on this through their app (I understand that its very difficult to get such a trade to happen even if the order were placed but..) The app won't even allow you to place an order to close your credit spread with a credit. It should always be with a debit. I am curious, is there any broker which would allow you to close your credit spread for a credit ?  How do people take advantage of such arbitrage ?",
            "I have a hypothetical question. Let's say I have a call option that has lost a most of its value and expires this week, but I want to roll it because I think the stock price will go up by the end of the year. If I choose to roll it out 1-2 years at an unrealistically high strike price (+150%) for a very tiny debit cost, would this be a bad idea? Let's say the option originally costed $500, lost 70% value, and the debit paid to roll out would be $10. The way I'm seeing it is that I could spend very little extra money to gain some sort of value back as the price increases over time even if there's no way I reach that unrealistic strike price and actually break even. Does this make any sense, or is this total nonsense?",

After noticing this, I sell either the losing call or put. \n\nIs there a name for this or is this just hedging?",

Whatever book you read make sure there are chapters on Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho. The most important thing is that you understand the impact of the Greeks on you P&L. The second thing is to understand the optimal way to express your opinion. Selling a put or buying a call are both bullish but they have different risk profiles. Shelly Natenberg's book is good for Greeks butr it is a thick book that is difficult to understand  some of it. Tony Saliba's book on spreads is very clearly written and a great choice for you second book. The number one book I reccomend to new traders is \" Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\". It's not about options but it is a great book to read to get your head clear. Even now , I still read it every couple of years.",

It sounds like you are ready to \"read\" a couple of books and give options a go within a month. To do options correctly and not lose money, it gonna take months and maybe years before you can say you have it down. This is why so many option traders lose money. They dont learn about Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega,IV, IV crush and stops. You have to figure in trends, news timing. The list goes on and on. I would start with trading shares, day trading, and shorting on a legit platform. Not RobinRetail.

This can mean catastrophic failure aka the Maginot Line in France 1940. \n\nThe French generals planned for a replay of World War I. The German blitzkrieg and infiltration of the Ardennes forest meant the French fortifications were near useless. This is sometimes what happens to Black Swan hedges.

        "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nI have a question about non-standard call options. I read that in general, the liquidity on non-standard options is very dry, with very low volumes and wide bid-ask spreads. But let\u2019s assume I purchased a call option before a corporate event and after the corporate event happened, the call options are in the money with the market value higher than the strike price. Will it still be hard to sell the call option in this case? Or will there usually be another person on the other side since they can still buy the option, exercise and sell the stock in the market at a higher price? \n\nLove to get anyone thoughts on this. Much appreciated! ",
