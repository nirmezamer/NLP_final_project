I work full time so i can't really stay whole time in front of TWS looking for trends ecc and I'm already doing paper trading, but somehow I don't understand the results.\n\nI may do something completely wrong here but what i do is to use options on SPY NVDA and AAPL.\n\nI select contracts with price below 10 USD and high volume. let's assume that bid ask is 6.34-6.37.\n\nI would then place a stop buy order i.e. at 6.70 and place an automatic sell limit order at 7.30 or 7.50\n\nmy assumption is that if the option rises in price (be it put or call) then price will go up a little bit, while if the price go down nothing happens.\n\nin the evening then i amend the open orders using the new bid-ask prices. so i.e. if one day i had set stop price at 6.50, but the option lost value i.e. to 5.50, i set stop price at 6 for the next day, and the limit price goes also down.\n\nis this reasonable or totally wrong?\n\nsome contracts are working well but others no\n\nthanks",

I understand I\u2019m supposed to sell (not exercise since I don\u2019t have the actual shares) but my thought was I can sell for a profit at 13.

If the resale value incudes the price increase, why would someone buy an option from the option seller? \nIf the goal is to exercise the calls, then I don't see why someone would purchase a call and then exercise it when it would cost similar to just buy the shares \n\n2. If I buy a call option, then sell it. Can the person who paid for the option from me exercise that call and require me to deliver the shares? \n\nThanks in advance",

So in effect 1.6% premium and a further \u00a320 after fees if my shares are called away.\n\nFor 52 days out this feels fair to me, I'm getting an extra 1.6%   yield and if I'm called away a capital gain of 3.5% all tax free as within allowances.\n\nWould I be right in thinking that if I can keep getting \u00a39.3 each 50 odd days without shares getting called away, I'll make over an additional 11% Yield? As I can sell around 7 covered calls in one tax year.\n\nThanks again for all the help so far, been a really supportive reddit",
            "Often times, the bid of call/put credit spread goes in the negative. If I understand it correctly, this is what they call \"arbitrage\". Robinhood doesnt let you capitalize on this through their app (I understand that its very difficult to get such a trade to happen even if the order were placed but..) The app won't even allow you to place an order to close your credit spread with a credit. It should always be with a debit. I am curious, is there any broker which would allow you to close your credit spread for a credit ?  How do people take advantage of such arbitrage ?",
            "I have a hypothetical question. Let's say I have a call option that has lost a most of its value and expires this week, but I want to roll it because I think the stock price will go up by the end of the year. If I choose to roll it out 1-2 years at an unrealistically high strike price (+150%) for a very tiny debit cost, would this be a bad idea? Let's say the option originally costed $500, lost 70% value, and the debit paid to roll out would be $10. The way I'm seeing it is that I could spend very little extra money to gain some sort of value back as the price increases over time even if there's no way I reach that unrealistic strike price and actually break even. Does this make any sense, or is this total nonsense?"

            "I suffered a 66 percent drawdown in the trading account, triggering the margin call. The stock market recovered from the very short bear market. My trading account is only now reaching adjusted new highs, four years after the margin call. The buy and hold account was up for calendar 2020. I also always have at least six months expenses in ready cash. \n\nBe very careful. All assets can become correlated down in a big crash. Margin requirements can tighten dramatically over night if crap hits the fan. The next crash may not be like previous ones.\n\nIt is akin to battle field generals plotting strategy based on the previous war. This can mean catastrophic failure aka the Maginot Line in France 1940. \n\nThe French generals planned for a replay of World War I. The German blitzkrieg and infiltration of the Ardennes forest meant the French fortifications were near useless. This is sometimes what happens to Black Swan hedges. A new unexpected event causes the hedge to fail. This happened in 1987 when portfolio insurance via options were a factor in cascading the stock market lower instead of protecting. \n\nBe careful."

            "Books are complex and often outdated. My suggestion is to start paper trading using 1-2 concepts at a time. Then watch videos etc. Once you are along the way, then read a book or two as the concepts will make sense.",
            "I was an option pit trader for 15 years, then a hedge fund manager and prop trader for 24 years. Options have always been in my tool box. Whatever book you read make sure there are chapters on Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho. The most important thing is that you understand the impact of the Greeks on you P&L. The second thing is to understand the optimal way to express your opinion. Selling a put or buying a call are both bullish but they have different risk profiles. Shelly Natenberg's book is good for Greeks butr it is a thick book that is difficult to understand  some of it. Tony Saliba's book on spreads is very clearly written and a great choice for you second book. The number one book I reccomend to new traders is \" Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\". It's not about options but it is a great book to read to get your head clear. Even now , I still read it every couple of years.",

The trades I make are usually relatively safe and I never trade more than I could easily wire in to cover should I need to. I've been trading options for the last couple of years and have level three access on Fidelity. That being said there are still some restrictions That make me miss out on some plays such as not being able to trade 0dte even if they are covered calls or cash covered puts. If I decided to move elsewhere what would your recommendations be?",

            "I\u2019ve tried Tasty, Fidelity, and Webull and found each of them lacking in some respect. I\u2019m still learning ToS, but I\u2019ll like it so far. I only have level 2 though. Not sure how they treat level 3.",
            "That\u2019s a bit suspicious.  I trade with SERIOUSLY less than $1M, Fidelity\u2019s rule for 0dte, and do not care to use margin.  But I recently placed a 0dte cash order that was accepted.  Granted, I rethought the matter and cancelled fairly quickly, but Fidelity has never been slow about telling me to get back in my lane when I attempt to enter a trade incorrectly. \n\nI believe there are 0dte plays that are allowed but not highly advertised.  Perhaps try a Cash trade.",

            "I was outta there within a month. They would approve me for nothing with over 200k . Just put the money in Sgov, went back to Tos getting 70% Buying Power on the Sgov. Also their trading platform is the worst.\n\nTos is great , but complicated. Also with Schwab, will they approve you for options. It is a game that the broker houses play. Also their trade desk with the old floor traders from Tos seems gone. Get clear on if they will give you full options (Selling Calls in a margin account).\n\nIf they play games go to Tasty (written by the same group that wrote Tos) full options is a checkbox, no BS. Their Analyze page not as good, but simple to enter trades. In any event check out Tastylive best vids on options. Also they give you 75% Option Buying Power on SGOV or those type Etf's. They do not have mutual funds, they will buy treasury for you but no web page.",
            "I opened a Webull account a month ago and I\u2019m really liking it. The only thing I hate is they don\u2019t allow you to do \u201cpush\u201d ACHs where you can initiate it from your other bank/broker. They insist that you initiate it through them and they take 4 days to make it fully available in your options buying power. They\u2019ll give you up to $50K in instant buying power for stock trades, but not options. \n\nSo transferring money IN is an unnecessarily slow process, but it\u2019s great once everything is settled. Oddly enough they\u2019re lightning fast when you transfer money out. I did a withdrawal and it got credited to my bank account later the same day. \n\nAlso I quite like saving that 65\u00a2 per contract fee. I gave Fidelity $4,500 in options commissions last year.",
