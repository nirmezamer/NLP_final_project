Im on the ps5, have opened a few since the update, but theyre still showing on the mini-map, and not in stats for the village. Theyre definitely open. I cant re-collect them and the wand handles and, room of requirement stuff are showing up in collections. Ive noticed it in the villages, havent tried it in the castle or hogsmeade yet.\n\nIn fact, Ive also noticed its showing up Merlin trials Ive already done. Its got the fern leaf symbol under the awning thing that pops up.",

Then the game that I was playing...new runthrough as Hufflepuff...had all spells, clothing, spellcrafts etc...unlocked. I was not going to delete the game so I have a \"freebie\" game. By the way I decided on being a Hufflepuff as yellow is one of my favorite colors.",

I love villains that are, for the most part, very polite and can still navigate normal society simply because the law cannot prove the terrible things everyone knows he has done. That being said... Rookwood and Harlow need either no hats or different hats.  It's may be wizarding-world fashion, but it's not fashion I'm intimidated by.",

            "Villains are always great. I love him even if I don't love his design. There was a moment I wasn't looking at my TV/computer and a Hogwarts Legacy add popped up. The second I heard him say \"Come now, no need for theatrics\" the ad instantly had my attention. It made me realize this game was even being developed. Now it's one of the best lines in the whole game. \n\nI get why some people like the hat. Yes it's accurate, yes top hats can be cool (I like them on the poacher goons!), but for a character with cinematic cut-scenes, I cannot look him in the eye when he is on screen. That's a problem. I want to took at his face and expressions, but my eyes are always drawn up by the tall black thing that's larger than his entire skull.  Accessories can be distracting... that's all I'm saying.",

Pippin (potions seller in Hogsmeade). so if you close your eyes during the cutscene where said ghost is talking to Nearly Headless Nick, it sounds like Gladwin Moon and J. Pippin are having a really out-of-context conversation ",
            "Sorry you find the hat distracting but to love DR is to love the hat.  My only complaint about him is that in certain cutscenes he is duckfooted   \n  \nYeah, he has a really hot voice.  He wouldn't be half as hot without it.",
