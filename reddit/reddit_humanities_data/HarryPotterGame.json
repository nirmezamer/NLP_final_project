            "Has anyone noticed their collection chests not registering since the new update? I\u2019m on the ps5, have opened a few since the update, but they\u2019re still showing on the mini-map, and not in stats for the village. They\u2019re definitely open. I can\u2019t re-collect them and the wand handles and, room of requirement stuff are showing up in collections. I\u2019ve noticed it in the villages, haven\u2019t tried it in the castle or hogsmeade yet.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve also noticed it\u2019s showing up Merlin trials I\u2019ve already done. It\u2019s got the fern leaf symbol under the awning thing that pops up.",
            "Playing the game on hard (first time playing this, but highly experienced with these types of games). Is it possible to chain Protego on rapid fire attacks? I see videos of people playing on hard mode and enemies stand around and attack one at a time to allow Protego to work, but I regularly get chain attacked where if I Protego, while the animation is coming off, another attack strikes through before I can dodge or Protego.\n\nAdditionally, I know red aura means unblockable, and yellow means you can use Protego, but what does it mean when there's an attack without an aura? Is that an enemy attacking off screen?\n\nMy experience with parry/dodge mechanics tells me that the parry mechanic SHOULD be better, but my in-game observation is that it is actually the weaker option. Is there a breakdown on those mechanics, and how a player is expected to Protego chain attacks, or attacks without warning (is it tied to a talent?)?",

As soon as the battle starts, like 1-2 seconds in, the whole system crashes. \n\nDisabling raytracing fixes the issue.\n\nAny suggestions?",
            "So does everyone else\u2019s game crash on PC since the new update",
            "Haven't played the game since the month it released. Did the exclusive PlayStation quest every come to PC?",

Then the game that I was playing...new runthrough as\u00a0 Hufflepuff...had all spells, clothing, spellcrafts etc...unlocked. I was not going to delete the game so I have a \"freebie\" game.\u00a0 By the way I decided on being a Hufflepuff as yellow is one of my favorite colors.",
