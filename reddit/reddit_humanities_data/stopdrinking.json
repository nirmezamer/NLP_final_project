        "content": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nGood morning sobernauts,\n\nTo me, your advice on yesterday\u2019s topic gratitude, really marked a highlight, this week. Thank you!\n\nToday, I would like to discuss a serious topic, which is particularly relevant to me and probably the most of us.\n\n**Relapse prevention aka \u201cseemingly trivial decisions\u201d**\n\nRecently, me and my girlfriend were invited to a family barbecue by her aunt and uncle. It was still 2ish weeks until then, and I joyfully accepted, because I knew there will be a ton of homemade charr-grilled shashlik. My gf always asks me first out of consideration, because there is usually a lot of beer and vodka on the table. Her family knows about my alcoholism, so they wouldn\u00b4t offer me any, but it\u00b4s there. And usually, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. \n\nThe day comes, and I\u00b4m in a poor mood for a couple of days already. We went there anyway and looking at all the people smashing beers and vodka in beautiful sunny setting made me jealous.\n\nWe went home early, and my gf went to her night shift. My gfs daughter was spending the night at her dads. \n\nBOOM \u2013 there I was\u2026 the appartement to myself, the whole night and cravings as fuck. Mental gymnastics are setting in: \u201cYou can have a few\u2026., nobody will know\u2026.\u201d   FUCK NO!\n\nLuckily, I made the call to one of my friends from a sober group and we met up immediately and he helped me through it. But \u2013 close call \u2013 closer than ever in those 11 months I am sober now.\n\nI just wanted to share how a series of seemingly trivial decisions put me in a spot, I certainly didn\u2019t want to be in. Endangering my sobriety. I should have cancelled the BBQ that day. \n\n**Question: Have you had a close call or relapsed out of a series of seemingly trivial decisions?**\n\nMy late dad always used to say: \u201cThe devil is a squirrel!\u201d, Now I understand. \nMy dad died 2009 of liver failure, because he was an alcoholic btw\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s one more reason why\u2026..\n\nI WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!\n\nTortey\n\nSorry for the long-winded post today, but tomorrow, there will be a special, so stay tuned! :-)\n",

Just one shot, nobody needs to know, just small beer after shift, just one glass of bubbles at home. You name it, there it is.\n\nIt is going semi ok. I run home from work, try to keep myself busy at home, it feels like Im making up most banal tasks just to keep me occupied.\n\nHubby is going out tomorrow with our drinking buddies. I still dont feel I can socialise too much, at least not with those people, but I don't plan on stopping him, he is not the one with the problem. \n\nI will spent the night reading my journal from past days, specially first ones, to remember myself why I don't want to be there. Last year, after 2 and something months sober, I fell into moderating trap and found myself on the ground with fucked up face 10 months later. Not doing it again.\n\nIWNDWYT \u2764\ufe0f",

What a feeling. First of its kind in this situation. \n\nOld, shitty me would be halfway through a 6 pack of high ABV beers, opened the minute my family rolled out the driveway, I would have likely spilled food on my shirt, barely remembered the show and would have to rewatch it, neglected my dog, and probably spent a moment or 5 wallowing in some form of self-pity, waking up on the couch at 3am with the lights on. \n\nFUCK.
