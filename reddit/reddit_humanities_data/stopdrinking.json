        "content": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nGood morning sobernauts,\n\nTo me, your advice on yesterday\u2019s topic gratitude, really marked a highlight, this week. Thank you!\n\nToday, I would like to discuss a serious topic, which is particularly relevant to me and probably the most of us.\n\n**Relapse prevention aka \u201cseemingly trivial decisions\u201d**\n\nRecently, me and my girlfriend were invited to a family barbecue by her aunt and uncle. It was still 2ish weeks until then, and I joyfully accepted, because I knew there will be a ton of homemade charr-grilled shashlik. My gf always asks me first out of consideration, because there is usually a lot of beer and vodka on the table. Her family knows about my alcoholism, so they wouldn\u00b4t offer me any, but it\u00b4s there. And usually, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. \n\nThe day comes, and I\u00b4m in a poor mood for a couple of days already. We went there anyway and looking at all the people smashing beers and vodka in beautiful sunny setting made me jealous.\n\nWe went home early, and my gf went to her night shift. My gfs daughter was spending the night at her dads. \n\nBOOM \u2013 there I was\u2026 the appartement to myself, the whole night and cravings as fuck. Mental gymnastics are setting in: \u201cYou can have a few\u2026., nobody will know\u2026.\u201d   FUCK NO!\n\nLuckily, I made the call to one of my friends from a sober group and we met up immediately and he helped me through it. But \u2013 close call \u2013 closer than ever in those 11 months I am sober now.\n\nI just wanted to share how a series of seemingly trivial decisions put me in a spot, I certainly didn\u2019t want to be in. Endangering my sobriety. I should have cancelled the BBQ that day. \n\n**Question: Have you had a close call or relapsed out of a series of seemingly trivial decisions?**\n\nMy late dad always used to say: \u201cThe devil is a squirrel!\u201d, Now I understand. \nMy dad died 2009 of liver failure, because he was an alcoholic btw\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s one more reason why\u2026..\n\nI WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!\n\nTortey\n\nSorry for the long-winded post today, but tomorrow, there will be a special, so stay tuned! :-)\n",

One slightly wrong move or event in early sobriety is probably better planned around or evaded. I skipped some work drinks this week in the scorching heat as my colleagues are very pro-booze. I think it gets easier to expose yourself to those things the longer you\u2019re sober. IWNDWYT.",

Of course usually on a Friday night I'd be well over the drink-drive limit. Instead I picked up my keys, got in the car and had them picked up within half an hour and delivered to their door half an hour after that.\n\n1 week in now and feeling good about myself, which is a nice feeling that I want to hang onto.",

I had one moment during the vacation where I wanted a drink (my 4 year old was having a huge meltdown for over an hour) but I stepped away and remembered it doesn\u2019t actually fix anything and the craving passed.

It's not just 1, maybe 2, its now 3 and sometimes 4 days afterwards.\n\nI already feel a billion times better after only a few days away from the booze.  Self esteem has sky rocketed and life in general is better.\n\nI used to be able to party and put on my work clothes and take care of business, but that's just not the case anymore.",

I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve been this long without drinking - Im going to say 20years ( fuck that\u2019s rough to type out) \n\nThis sub, the DCI and I am Sober app have been great for me to check in on during the day and remind myself why I will not drink with you today. \n\nI commented this on another post last night..\n\n\nSomething that\u2019s working for me - I\u2019m using the I am Sober App and everyday when I check in it asks for your emotions for the day.

What a feeling. First of its kind in this situation. \n\nOld, shitty me would be halfway through a 6 pack of high ABV beers, opened the minute my family rolled out the driveway, I would have likely spilled food on my shirt, barely remembered the show and would have to rewatch it, neglected my dog, and probably spent a moment or 5 wallowing in some form of self-pity, waking up on the couch at 3am with the lights on. \n\nFUCK.
