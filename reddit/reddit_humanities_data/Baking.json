        "content": "I bake purely as a hobby, but a few months ago a family friend insisted on \u201chiring me\u201d to make sugar cookies for her daughter\u2019s bridal shower. She told me the theme was lemon and let me know what colors she wanted, but beyond that told me I could do whatever I liked. I recommended she hire a local bakery near us for the job, but she was very excited and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so I hesitantly agreed. The party is tomorrow and I made the cookies in the first picture two days ago so the icing would have plenty of time to set, but it\u2019s been nearly 100 degrees and humid every day this week and we live in an old house with bad air circulation. I used the same icing recipe I always do (normal results in the second photo) but either I royally (\ud83d\ude2d) fucked up or the temperature is ruining the texture. Either way, please send help. She\u2019s coming to pick up tomorrow and I spent several days making, baking, and decorating 5 dozen cookies for her that look like this and I\u2019m so embarrassed \ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t think I have time to scrape and redo them all at my crappy amateur decorating level, but if I pulled an all nighter and gave it a hail mary would they set? Or if heat/humidity are the problem would that be even worse? For reference, my partner did a test for quality control and said they\u2019re very yummy, but I am still freaked out. Any advice appreciated. \n",

            "Try placing them into a warm oven, not hot, it'll finish drying them out. When I first started doing cookies I was in an apt with no circulation and my icing was always like yours. It was either from over beating the icing or my apt being too humid. The oven trick was taught to me by the cookie elders.",
            "Here\u2019s the thing, you let your family friend know you weren\u2019t 100% confident AND the weather is effecting your bakes. My immediate thought when I saw them was \u201cHumidity\u201d.\n\nI wish I had more advice but sugar cookies aren\u2019t my wheelhouse. I\u2019m going to do some quick research and see if I find anything about troubleshooting. If there\u2019s anything I think would be helpful, I\u2019ll report back. \n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself! They look good despite their irregularities and most importantly taste good.",
            "Send help\u2026 to eat them?  You want help eating right?  Because they look bomb as heck to me!",
            "Don't be too hard on yourself - they look pretty and you set expectations accordingly with your friend. If they really aren't drying, your problem is probably that the icing itself is overmixed. If you push a finger onto it, does it feel spongy? That, plus the slightly pitted look, are usually signs of overmixing. If you scrape and re-do, I would try it with a fresh batch of icing. (As somebody who does a lot of decorated sugar cookies and has had my fair share of last minute oopsies, I'm sending hugs your way!!)",
            "Not a baker, but a cookie lover and all of these look delicious!",
            "I saw the first picture in the feed and came here expecting to find a second \"after\" picture in which they're ruined! \n\nThey look good! Sure , do what you can to help them set but If they aren't fully set that's still fine.",
            "I think those look delicious! Don't be hard on yourself OP, I think you did really well. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI remember seeing another post where a baker had trouble with humidity messing with royal icing and someone had suggested using a dehydrator. The comment said that: \"Typically people buy these to make jerky or dried fruits at home, but I read this tip on a cookie blog and I love my dehydrator! Not only does it keep the cookies crisp and fresh, but it also helps your icing dry faster and more evenly.\"\n\nIt may not fix the icing but it sounds like it may help to keep the humidity from affecting the cookies. Hope this helps a bit!",
            "I think they look fine. You were very forward about your comfort level for this project and think you did everything in good faith to deliver. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.",
            "My first reaction was; Oh how cute!!!!! I want those now!!!",
            "I would be over the moon to receive these. \n\nMy mom bakes sugar cookies around holidays, but mainly during the cooler part of the year because the humidity here DEFINITELY messes with them. If I were you, I wouldnt scrap the work youve done, especially if it will take you not sleeping to be able to redo them. \n\nThey are super cute and have a homemade charm about them. Be proud of your work!"
