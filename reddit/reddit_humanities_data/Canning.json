        "content": "The mods of r/canning have an exciting opportunity we'd like to share with you!\n\nReddit's Community Funds Program (r/CommunityFunds) recently reached out to us and let us know about the program. Visit the wiki to learn more, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunityFunds/wiki/). TL;dr version: we can apply for up to $50,000 in grant money to carry out a project centered around our sub and its membership.\n\nOur idea would be to source recipe ideas from this community, come up with a method and budget to develop them into tested recipes, and then release them as open-source recipes for everyone to use free of charge.\n\nWhat we would need:\n\nFirst, the aim of this program is to promote community building, engagement, and participation within our sub. We would like to gauge interest, get recommendations, and find out who could participate and in what capacity. If there is enough interest, the mod team will write a proposal and submit it.\n\nIf approved, we would need help from community members to carry out the development. Some ideas of things we would need are community members to create or source the recipes, help by preparing them and giving feedback on taste/quality/etc., and help with carefully documenting the recipe steps.\n\nIf we get approved, and can get the help we need from the community, then the next steps are actually doing the thing! This will involve working closely with a food lab at a university. Currently, the mod heading up this project has access to Oregon State and New Mexico State University, but we are open to working with other universities depending on some factors like cost, availability, timeline, and ease of access since samples will have to be shipped.\n\nPlease let us know what you think through a comment or modmail if this sounds exciting to you, or if you have any ideas on how we might alter the scope or aim of this project.",

            "I really hope this works out.  I read in a recent post about canning meat that there are no tested recipes for ground turkey.  If it hasn't been already ruled out previously, I would think testing for this would be helpful for those of us who regularly add it to their chili and spaghetti sauces and such.  Any other proteins that haven't had any testing that people like to cook regular meals with too would be helpful.",

            "I would love testing to be done on canning shredded cabbage.  I don't want to can shredded cabbage on its own mind you, but I've read the reason a safe broscht canning recipe can't be developed yet is because no testing has been done on the safety of adding cabbage to the soup recipe you can.",

            "Oh this is a fabulous opportunity. So many people have requested recipes for various things in the last couple years. There should be no problem identifying frequently requested recipes for testing. Moreover, the traffic and needs expressed in this group, present more than adequate data to support the request. If funds can be obtained, it seems that an RFP would need to be issued to testing labs to ensure fairness and competition as well as best use of funds.",
            "I've wondered if it's possible to have the jam/jelly version of the make your own soup recipe! Using a total volume of some sort or some sorta proven safe way to make it work, it can be a mix of safe jam/jelly ingredients and pectin as needed.\n\nOh and curry recipes! Or at least curry sauce. I don't can but this sounds awesome! Just add the dairy product of choice (or high fat or both) when cooking it if that's desired.\n\nMaybe a refried beans but canned? (Aka intentionally turning beans into mush!). Not just turning whole beans into mush, but canned as mush. This is more of a curiosity thing.\n\nOther juice choices like pineapples and other acidic enough fruit besides cranberries, apples, and grapes (along with already approved options)! Or even the juice version of make your own soup with safe fruit options. I can see this being super popular.\n\nApple sauce with other fruits mixed in? It would probably be rather hard to make the recipes for those though...\n\nREALLY LATE EDIT: Celery! Very few safe recipes have celery and some people want to can that safely so... is celery cannable on its own/in more recipes?"

It was a fairly simple recipe I found on line; blueberries, honey, cinnamon, and thickened with corn starch. \n\nDuring one batch (between fielding questions and fixing breakfast for 12 people) I put a bit too much corn starch in the syrup.  Since I served it warm (over french toast and waffles) I didn't notice the change. \n\nThe next day, when I pulled out the remaining syrup, it was almost at the consistency of a soft jelly and that got me thinking...\n\nWhat alternative methods of thickening can you use aside from pectin? \n\nI have read where apples can work--could pears do the same? \n\nI have read conflicting stories that unripe apples and pears are a better source of pectin than ripe fruit--is this true? I have two pear trees FULL of fruit right now--the idea that they can also provide the thickening agent for my jams and jellies would be REALLY cool.\n\nCan I use cornstarch as an alternative?",

            "You can make and can your own pectin from apple cores.  It's very simple, and makes an effective liquid pectin that works for most jams or jellies (pot full of cores or whole apples, water to prevent sticking, cook to mushy, strain liquid out- that's the pectin).  When using it you just follow a tested liquid pectin recipe.\n\nYou can also make pectin free jam or jelly from many fruits- the set is not as stiff, and the flavor is different from a long, slow cooking time.  I actually love the more cooked flavor of Ball's Old Fashioned No Pectin Strawberry jam (with vanilla, which is an available variation in my copy of the book)- it is like an old fashioned ice cream syrup.",
            "Canning the blueberries in a light or medium sugar syrup then thickening with cornstarch when you open it would work. \n\nSome fruit contains more pectin that others and unripe fruit contains more than ripe fruit.

            "Sauce tomatoes are less juicy than regular tomatoes so you might get a thicker product if using the paste tomato. If it's a yellow variety, the finished product will obviously look different (might be some strange ketchup, lol). Make sure to use bottled lemon juice and/or vinegar with 5% acidity (modern tomato varieties tend to be sweeter and may be lower acid so additional acid ensures safety). Taste your tomatoes once they are fully ripe and if it's really bland, you might want to add a different variety tomato to give it a boost in flavour).",

For my sweet and hot cherry peppers, I just use a brine where I can store them in the fridge in one big jar for the year (most recipes claim this method is only good for a few months but I've had no issues with pickles or peppers this way and honestly, after a year I think the fridge version of both pickles and peppers end up less soft than water bath canning with pickle crisp after year).  For the cherry peppers I use something like a small bamboo skewer and poke four holes around the green from the plant stem so the liquid can get in.  Throw them in the jar, add brine and spices you want, use a food saver to seal (and transfer some brine inside the pepper).  Peperoncini and Sweet banana I just cut into slices and do the same thing.",

That is just a basic brine.  The peperoncini's are a bit more complicated but seems like the extras are dyes, citric acid and turmeric.  Their jalapeno's have turmeric as well (maybe you like the turmeric?)  It seems really basic though.  Personally I use mustard seed, coriander, cayenne pepper flakes and a bit of ground black pepper.  For pickles, just add dill.  Some people like to use sugar.  Honestly, if you start making your own with a recipe you like... you'll like it just as much as anything store bought eventually from my experience."
