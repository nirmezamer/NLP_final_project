        "content": "The mods of r/canning have an exciting opportunity we'd like to share with you!\n\nReddit's Community Funds Program (r/CommunityFunds) recently reached out to us and let us know about the program. Visit the wiki to learn more, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunityFunds/wiki/). TL;dr version: we can apply for up to $50,000 in grant money to carry out a project centered around our sub and its membership.\n\nOur idea would be to source recipe ideas from this community, come up with a method and budget to develop them into tested recipes, and then release them as open-source recipes for everyone to use free of charge.\n\nWhat we would need:\n\nFirst, the aim of this program is to promote community building, engagement, and participation within our sub. We would like to gauge interest, get recommendations, and find out who could participate and in what capacity. If there is enough interest, the mod team will write a proposal and submit it.\n\nIf approved, we would need help from community members to carry out the development. Some ideas of things we would need are community members to create or source the recipes, help by preparing them and giving feedback on taste/quality/etc., and help with carefully documenting the recipe steps.\n\nIf we get approved, and can get the help we need from the community, then the next steps are actually doing the thing! This will involve working closely with a food lab at a university. Currently, the mod heading up this project has access to Oregon State and New Mexico State University, but we are open to working with other universities depending on some factors like cost, availability, timeline, and ease of access since samples will have to be shipped.\n\nPlease let us know what you think through a comment or modmail if this sounds exciting to you, or if you have any ideas on how we might alter the scope or aim of this project.",

            "I really hope this works out.  I read in a recent post about canning meat that there are no tested recipes for ground turkey.  If it hasn't been already ruled out previously, I would think testing for this would be helpful for those of us who regularly add it to their chili and spaghetti sauces and such.  Any other proteins that haven't had any testing that people like to cook regular meals with too would be helpful.",
            "This sounds like an awesome use of the community funds program!",
            "That sounds so cool! I would be happy to try out and give feedback on recipes.",
            "This is so cool I had no idea Reddit did this. I think getting some recipes tested would be an excellent project!",
            "I would love testing to be done on canning shredded cabbage.  I don't want to can shredded cabbage on its own mind you, but I've read the reason a safe broscht canning recipe can't be developed yet is because no testing has been done on the safety of adding cabbage to the soup recipe you can.",
            "I'm really excited about this idea!",
            "I\u2019d be interested in helping! I\u2019m a newbie looking to get into canning, done a lot of research but looking for a push to buy supplies and jump in!",
            "I am excited NMSU is involved, I live here and am kind of proud. I am really looking forward any new canning recipes, especially ones that include meat as those are limited.  Green chili stew with chicken or pork. (I guess this could be made using a soup recipie).  I would be interested in a Korean beef, Jjimdak (Korean chicken),  a thick and hearty spaghetti sauce (I tried the one in the ball book and hated it), peanut butter and sweet potatoe soup, or African peanut chicken stew.   I have tried a few of the meals in jars and have found a couple I love, so would be happy to see more.",
            "Looking through the comments here, I think a theme that might resonate with the application process and the sub's user base both is getting global recipes tested to USDA standards. Happy to help write, test, reach out and let me know.",
            "Oh that sounds very interesting. I\u2019d love a recipe that tastes like Crofter\u2019s Seedless Raspberry or Strawberry that\u2019s confirmed safe to can - they\u2019re very true to the flavor of the berries and not super sweet."

        "content": "Had some family over and I experimented with a blueberry syrup.  It was a fairly simple recipe I found on line; blueberries, honey, cinnamon, and thickened with corn starch. \n\nDuring one batch (between fielding questions and fixing breakfast for 12 people) I put a bit too much corn starch in the syrup.  Since I served it warm (over french toast and waffles) I didn't notice the change. \n\nThe next day, when I pulled out the remaining syrup, it was almost at the consistency of a soft jelly and that got me thinking...\n\nWhat alternative methods of thickening can you use aside from pectin? \n\nI have read where apples can work--could pears do the same? \n\nI have read conflicting stories that unripe apples and pears are a better source of pectin than ripe fruit--is this true? I have two pear trees FULL of fruit right now--the idea that they can also provide the thickening agent for my jams and jellies would be REALLY cool.\n\nCan I use cornstarch as an alternative?",

            "Bring the jelly to 225 F and it will gel without pectin. Boil for a little longer and it will thicken up nicely. You're using the sugar as the gelling agent along with the naturally occurring pectin in the fruit.",
            "You can make and can your own pectin from apple cores.  It's very simple, and makes an effective liquid pectin that works for most jams or jellies (pot full of cores or whole apples, water to prevent sticking, cook to mushy, strain liquid out- that's the pectin).  When using it you just follow a tested liquid pectin recipe.\n\nYou can also make pectin free jam or jelly from many fruits- the set is not as stiff, and the flavor is different from a long, slow cooking time.  I actually love the more cooked flavor of Ball's Old Fashioned No Pectin Strawberry jam (with vanilla, which is an available variation in my copy of the book)- it is like an old fashioned ice cream syrup.",
            "Canning the blueberries in a light or medium sugar syrup then thickening with cornstarch when you open it would work. \n\nSome fruit contains more pectin that others and unripe fruit contains more than ripe fruit. My preference is to use pectin (Pomona's low sugar kind)...it's less fussy than cooking the fruit to the set stage. I inadvertently made fruit leather once while trying to make apple jelly this way, lol.",

            "Honestly, folks, I don\u2019t understand the big deal about pectin. To my mind, less cooking time for jam means fresher fruit flavor. Pectin helps reduce cooking time. What am I missing?",
            "I use apples in most of my jams to thicken. And i also cook longer to evaporate the moisture to thicken as well",
            "All the old homesteads up in the mountains where I grew up had ancient quince trees. I remember asking my dad why and he said it was for making jams and jellies before there was store bought pectin. Not sure how it was used, but worth looking into.",
            "There are marmalade recipes that don't use any added pectin and you boil the spells to extract it for the marmalade. It's pretty fun to do if you never have. Apples are also very high in pectin and historically were used in many jams for their pectin, but modern recipes are not designed for that method and it's not safe for canning.",
            "The reason underripe or less sweet apples are used in receipts is that they are naturally high in pectin",
            "Grapefruit seeds and pith are one of the major sources for commercial pectin, which is why traditional marmalade recipes do not require additional pectin. I use grapefruit seeds in other jams, and they set nicely (caveat: I also am following Turkish jam recipes that add lemon juice and boil to 225F, so they are also high acidity and setting from the temperature)."
