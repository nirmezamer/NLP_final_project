            "I created a post on this but mods removed it and told me to post it here, so here it is:\n\n**PSA: dishwashers use less water than hand-washing**\n\nBased on my limited research, it seems that using your dishwasher can actually save a significant amount of water vs hand-washing. I know it\u2019s counterintuitive so I thought I\u2019d throw this out there for those of us looking to save as much water as possible. \n\n> How much water does a dishwasher use?\n\n>This may appear impossible since it seems like dishwashers are constantly spraying water, but a newer one does use less water than hand washing. Getting them clean in the sink can use up to 27 gallons of water per load. An Energy Star certified dishwasher can use as little as 3 gallons per load (around 11 litres), according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. In fact, an Energy Star certified dishwasher can save almost 5,000 gallons of water per year.\n\n>How new does your dishwasher need to be to get these savings? \n\n>In 2013, new standards were put in place that required dishwashers to use as much as 5 gallons per load. On the other hand, units built before 1994 can waste more than 10 gallons of water per load.\n\nSource: https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/how-much-water-do-dishwashers-use/",

            "[Column: Efforts to save money on pipelines in the 1970s will cost water systems billions in the years to come](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-pccp-20170824-story.html)\n\nArticle on PCCP water mains (the type that broke here).\n\n>When the MWD started installing PCCP lines in the 1970s, according to Gordon Johnson, the district\u2019s chief engineer, they were considered virtually interchangeable with steel pipelines. \u201cWe bid them against each other, and took the one that was the lowest bid,\u201d Johnson told me.\n\n>Both were expected to last 70 to 100 years. ***But while the steel pipelines are still mostly \u201cas good as new,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cPCCP just doesn\u2019t have the same life.\u201d***\n\n>The problem appears to be the liberalization of manufacturing standards in the early 1970s, just as the MWD started using the material. Perhaps complacently, engineering organizations promulgated liberalized standards for PCCP, incorporating reinforcing steel wires that were stronger, but also thinner. Those wires turned out to be more vulnerable to corrosion and brittleness than expected.\n\n>\u201cThey thought they\u2019d come up with a new technique that would be cheaper,\u201d says Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the MWD. ***The reality is that the lifespan of PCCP from that era is about half that of steel pipe.***\n\n>\u201cWhen the standards changed, you came into pipe that was more stressed than before,\u201d says Graham E. C. Bell, a coauthor of the 2008 study. ***The majority of catastrophic PCCP failures have been traced to pipes of the 1972-1978 vintage, when the eased standards were in effect.*** By the early 1980s, manufacturing standards had been tightened up considerably.\n\nBut who could have predicted that our PCCP water main from 1975 (that happens to be a single failure point for 60% of our water supply) would start having issues?\n\nCertainly not our city engineers.  \n\nI guess.",
            "This might be a dumb question, but does usage by time matter? I know that waiting as long as possible to do water-intensive activities is the guidance. But when we DO have to do dishes, shower, or wash clothes, does it help at all to do these at non-peak times to allow for more balanced usage and replenishment? IE - if I take a shower and do my dishes at 3:00am, will these help ease stress on the system at all, or is any cumulative water usage going to have the same effect on our reserves?",
            "In today's (June 19) 2pm press conference Deputy Chief Coby Duerr said that city staff are being harassed and called names while working.  I am disapointed that this has to be mentioned in a press conference, it's like scolding children.\n\nNeighbours, why? If this is you, shame on you. Why can't we just let these folks do their jobs?  If you have a question, call 311. Leave those working hard to fix this issue.\n\nIf you are such an expert and know that these folks are doing the work incorrectly, grab a shovel and get a job with the city to help out. The mayor has said they're using lots of contractors helping out. You should be one too.",

            "I heard the utilization factor for tomorrow.  If you have a westjet flight you are 85% fucked",
            "Important clarification: This is NOT a wildcat strike. A wildcat strike is when the workers go out without the union calling them out, and without support from the leadership (or at least without official support or approval). In Canada wildcat strikes are unprotected (often people say illegal, which is not exactly correct), so the company can fire/replace the workers, and the workers have no right to picket and can be penalized for it.\n\nIn this case the strike is protected. The CIRB did not restrict the union\u2019s ability to legally strike, so the leadership officially ordered the workers out as planned. The workers have the same rights they normally would. The CIRB will have an arbitrator determine the conditions of the agreement, so it\u2019s an uncommon situation where the strike theoretically can\u2019t affect the outcome of negotiations the way it normally would (since negotiating is effectively over with arbitration being brought in).\n\nI support wildcat strikes when necessary and strongly believe that our labour laws are far too restrictive on the workers as concerns what is defined as legal strike action, so I'm not making this comment to denigrate less official types of strikes by any means. But it can only help the bosses to say that a strike is unofficial or illegal, when in reality it\u2019s perfectly within the (again, extremely narrow) bounds of what our laws allow workers to do.\n\nOf course, despite being legal it is unconventional, and bold, and that should be celebrated.",

When I heard the government stepped in and told them they weren't allowed to strike I was unhappy about it. The government is supposed to be on our side, not the multi billions dollar company's side as they exploit thousands of workers and overcharge thousands of customers. Even though this is going to ruin my weekend I hope that this sends a proper message and gets those workers treated/paid better.",
