This incident impacts water availability throughout the city.\u00a0\n\n[**City of Calgary - Critical Water Main Break - Information**](https://www.calgary.ca/emergencies/critical-water-main-break-june-2024.html)",

            "This might be a dumb question, but does usage by time matter? I know that waiting as long as possible to do water-intensive activities is the guidance. But when we DO have to do dishes, shower, or wash clothes, does it help at all to do these at non-peak times to allow for more balanced usage and replenishment? IE - if I take a shower and do my dishes at 3:00am, will these help ease stress on the system at all, or is any cumulative water usage going to have the same effect on our reserves?",

            "Maybe a stupid question, but how do we think this is going to impact water costs going forward (if at all)?",
            "Thanks for the city order to Work from Home.  Hours ago Rich Kruger at Suncor sent us a special e-mail saying we all need to be in the offices all the way through this because F@#$ You.  We at Suncor share our CEO's vision of making work as $hitty and miserable as possible all while pointlessly wasting city resources.",
            "Got a call back from 311 today regarding the use of water for RV purposes. You ARE allowed to use water to flush out your trailer's water lines and fill your tank. Because people that are using their RV are likely going out of the city, their net use of water will most likely go down, ( as it was explained to me.) \nPosted the same question on my local Community page and as I predicted, (so shouldn't have wasted my time,) there were plenty of strong opinions and conjecture, but ZERO useful answers. Thought I would post this information here, as it could be useful to some.",
            "I'm curious about how quickly they can source enough pipe to fix all the problem areas and have spare on hand .\n\nThis could be an ongoing situation for the next decade while they plan a replacement/ secondary feeder.",
            "It's a little disconcerting to learn that, due to grade changes, one section of damaged pipe is buried inside a block of concrete, and workers can't cut that section out...  I hope this doesn't come back to haunt us.",
            "City is talking about collecting rainwater for gardens, but neglecting to suggest people collect rainwater for flushing toilets.",
            "There is always the possibility  to run temporary over-ground supply lines.\nI think this was done in Sask a few years ago.",
            "I looked at my past utility bills to see how much water we use, saw we're using a crazy amount and determined it's due to an Amazon sourced showerhead.  The math for our clothes washer and doing dishes wasn't adding up.  I timed how long the showerhead takes to fill a 4L pot and determined it consumes 960L per hour of usage!\n\nI like the showerhead because it's been far more durable than anything we've had from local home improvement centres so I ordered a flow restriction kit for it, which will arrive tomorrow.  It will go inline between the shower nozzle/handle and the hose, and has 5-6 different flow rate disks to replace and experiment.  I want to get it down to at least half."

            "Not sure how effective posting on this thread will be but here goes.. Im being relocated from Edmonton to Calgary for work, we dont really want to buy a place as my retirement is looming in five years or so and we own a property in the Okanagan that well be building on when that time comes, so a rental it is.  My office will be at 8th ave & 6th st SW, We only have one car and Id rather not buy another one so I would like to walk to work. The only catch is that we have a 70lb dog (good natured, quiet) so I would need to find a place that will allow him. Not really looking for specific places right now (we own our home in Edmonton, I can commute for a period of time until we find a place) more of a question of how difficult its going to be to find a pet friendly rental for a larger dog in close proximity to my new office ? Budget up to $3k possibly. Thanks for the input in advance",
