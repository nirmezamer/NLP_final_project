            "I\u2019m at my wits end. My phone shows no hubs responding  (3 AppleTV, 1 OG HomePod, 2 HomePod minis). But my iPad shows them as hubs and responding. I\u2019ve unplugged and restarted all the hubs multiple times. No idea why my phone shows unresponsive but iPad does not. Thoughts? Suggestions?",
            "I'm looking for a bright (> 1100 lumens) A19 HomeKit-compatible bulb. I found that Philips Hue has a 1500 lm bulb, and I'm considering ordering it and a hub, but I'd prefer to go with a design that doesn't require a hub. I currently use the Nanoleaf A19 bulbs in most places. They're pretty good but not quite bright enough for this one use case.  Thanks for any suggestions.\n\n- Pete",

I'm heard good things about the Eve outdoor floodlight/camera, but is that light strong enough for the driveway? I have power directly behind the garage wall where I plan to mount everything. I'm wondering if it's better to get a different camera and just install a stand alone flood light that will really make the driveway light up but don't know what I should be looking at.",
            "HomePod mini vs Apple TV Ethernet. I don\u2019t have a lot of HomeKit accessories but I figured I\u2019d stay with Apple HomeKit since I have an iPhone and iPad. I got the iSmartgate garage thing but it won\u2019t connect remotely. I think the hub for it ruined the other accessories I have and now I get no responses when I\u2019m off the WiFi. \n\nI don\u2019t particularly have any use for an Apple TV or HomePod but it says I need a hub in order to see these work remotely. Does the HomePod mini work well as a hub or would it be better to spend more and connect the Apple TV through Ethernet?",

It works to turn on, but the \u201c turn off after xx minutes\u201d setting is not working.  Same deal for a linkind matter lamp and eve sensor.  I feel so stupid.  Please help",

The former homeowner said they couldn't get the remote to work with it, even replaced the transponder etc. they said we should download the Meross app, which we did, but we can't sync it with the lightbulb because it won't turn on. Is the only solution to replace it?",

I hope I\u2019m missing something?",

However, when I ask Siri to do the same, it responds that I don't have it in my Apple library, even though I can see the option to play ambient sounds in the \"Good Night\" scene.\n\nOverall, Siri just seems stupid.\n\nAnything I should know?
