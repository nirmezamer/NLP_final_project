            "I\u2019m relatively new to the smart home game, but been trying to make my two-bedroom apartment smart over the last few weeks. Starting to get the general idea of how things work, but there are still a whole bunch of things that I\u2019m trying to figure out, even after dozens of hours of research.\n\nMy journey so far has been as follows:\n- Upgraded my entire WiFi setup by putting in place two Eros 6+ that are connected to each other via Ethernet backhaul to avoid WiFi loss\n- Decided to go with the Apple ecosystem as it seemed to be the best despite less compatibility \n- I connected my Apple TV via Ethernet to the router and set it as my home hub \n- I bought Sonos speakers to create a surround system that\u2019s connected to the TV via HDMI (soundbar, sub, and two back speakers); I\u2019ve connected the soundbar to the router via Ethernet and added it to my HomeKit app\n- My first foray into actual smart home was my purchase of smart plugs (meeros since they work with HomeKit - https://amzn.eu/d/d8laPBA) which I connected to the two bedside table lamps in my bedroom; I was able to easily add them to HomeKit as lights, and set scenes with them\n- I then got new smart curtains installed but only found out after that the Somfy motor was not HomeKit compatible (RTS vs IO); it came with a Tahoma switch hub, which allows me to control the curtains through the Tahoma app, but again not HomeKit compatible\n- I discovered the Shortcuts app and was able to set up a Siri shortcut to open and close the blinds so I can now do that verbally\n- I also set up good morning and goodnight shortcuts (named a bit differently as to not clash with the HomeKit reserved wording) which then run the relevant scene on HomeKit (basically turning on/off the side lamps for now) AND open/close the curtains\n- I also created an automation in shortcuts which runs the morning shortcut when my alarm goes off if I am at home\n- I installed Ecobee smart thermostats\n- I also just bought a couple of HomePods that I plan to put around the house\n\nSo basically, the main things I\u2019m struggling to wrap my head around are the following:\n1. Overarching question: I\u2019ve been reading about how smart devices slow down WiFi and how it may be better to go with zigbee or matter or thread or zwave or others instead; I\u2019m very confused about how to approach this and what I should look for in new devices that I buy / whether I need to change anything in my current set up\n2. From what I\u2019m seeing some devices require hubs while others don\u2019t. I don\u2019t fully understand why that\u2019s the case and whether I should be opting for devices that work independently or with a hub? And does each manufacturer need its own hub or can you just use one hub across all of them?\n3. My biggest goal is to make all the lights in my apartment smart, but I am struggling to determine whether to go with smart switches or smart relays (the internet seems divided); I care about the aesthetics of the apartment and don\u2019t want it to look overly techy / gimmicky so was leaning towards the smart relay approach but have heard that if I leave the apartment (either sell it or rent it out, they become a hassle for the next owner / tenant to figure out); I also have no neutral wires and the voltage where I am is similar to that of Europe and the UK, significantly higher than that of the US, therefore ruling out Lutron\u2019s Caseta line\n4. My smart curtains are working just fine right now because of the shortcuts app even though they don\u2019t appear in HomeKit; I therefore don\u2019t fully see what the big deal is with HomeKit compatibility and why it\u2019s important; is it worth getting a different motor that is HomeKit compatible instead? \n5. If HomeKit isn\u2019t crucial as mentioned above, do I even need compatibility for other products or can I just use the shortcuts app to achieve the exact same results? \n6. I usually have my phone with me wherever I am so what really is the point of the HomePod Siri feature? Are there any issues with which device responds and does the task when both my iPhone and HomePod are within earshot? \n7. Will the Siri HomePod also run my shortcuts or will it only respond to scenes / automations that are set up in HomeKit? If I ask the HomePod to turn on my alarm will it do so independently on the HomePod or also on my phone / will it run the shortcuts automation I\u2019ve set up based on my alarm going off? \n8. How will the HomePods interact with the Sonos system if I want to play music? Should I only play on one of them or both? Is it seamless? \n9. I currently use Spotify, do I need to switch to Apple Music for a more seamless experience? \n10. Finally (for now probably lol!) my fianc\u00e9e will be moving in with me in a couple of months, so how does this all play out? will she be able to use the HomePods? Will they be connected to both our accounts or just mine? Will they recognize her voice? Will she be able to use the shortcuts app shortcuts and automations I\u2019ve set up on my phone or does she have to set up her own?\n\nApologies for the insane amount of detail describing my journey and all the issues I\u2019m facing but I would be incredibly grateful for any clarifications and tips on my questions and in general!",
            "Hey everyone! I know there are a million outdoor camera rec posts, but I'm having a hard time finding the following:\n\nLove the Eve outdoor cameras, but I don't need a floodlight and don't have a light for it to replace. Which outdoor cameras are as reliable, private and secure with video stored in iCloud, and easy to install. I may have to bite the bullet and hire an electrician but are there alternatives?\n\nThanks!",
            "Hi, posting this here as I do not have enough karma to create my own thread. \n\nThe sewer system in my neighborhood backs up in heavy rains, causing flooding in our utility room and tub. To combat this, I've installed an automatic floodgate that stops sewer flow into and out of the house. So, when the floodgate is closed, we can't use any water in the house.\n\nI want to set up a system that notifies us with an audible alert and sends a message to our phones whenever the floodgate status changes. This way, we'll know when to stop and resume water usage.\n\nI've never used HomeKit before. Is this something I could do with HomeKit and a door sensor? Or are there other options?",
            "I\u2019m at my wits end. My phone shows no hubs responding  (3 AppleTV, 1 OG HomePod, 2 HomePod minis). But my iPad shows them as hubs and responding. I\u2019ve unplugged and restarted all the hubs multiple times. No idea why my phone shows unresponsive but iPad does not. Thoughts? Suggestions?",
            "I'm looking for a bright (> 1100 lumens) A19 HomeKit-compatible bulb. I found that Philips Hue has a 1500 lm bulb, and I'm considering ordering it and a hub, but I'd prefer to go with a design that doesn't require a hub. I currently use the Nanoleaf A19 bulbs in most places. They're pretty good but not quite bright enough for this one use case.  Thanks for any suggestions.\n\n- Pete",

I'm heard good things about the Eve outdoor floodlight/camera, but is that light strong enough for the driveway? I have power directly behind the garage wall where I plan to mount everything. I'm wondering if it's better to get a different camera and just install a stand alone flood light that will really make the driveway light up but don't know what I should be looking at.",
            "HomePod mini vs Apple TV Ethernet. I don\u2019t have a lot of HomeKit accessories but I figured I\u2019d stay with Apple HomeKit since I have an iPhone and iPad. I got the iSmartgate garage thing but it won\u2019t connect remotely. I think the hub for it ruined the other accessories I have and now I get no responses when I\u2019m off the WiFi. \n\nI don\u2019t particularly have any use for an Apple TV or HomePod but it says I need a hub in order to see these work remotely. Does the HomePod mini work well as a hub or would it be better to spend more and connect the Apple TV through Ethernet?",
