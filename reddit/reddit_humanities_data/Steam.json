Can't find the perfect survival sim or unsure which 1 RPG out of the thousands available you should buy? Well this is the thread for you. **This monthly megathread is meant to contain questions about what to play and suggestions to others on what to play**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to make this work best and not just be spammed with \"What should I play?\", **please be in-depth in what type of games you are looking for, and when giving advice it would be appreciated if you're more detailed than \"I think X game is good\"**. There are too many games to be able to properly suggest something with no background information, like-wise commenting a game title and saying you like the game offers no actual value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main purpose of this thread is to contain questions on what to play and advice to others on what to play, but feel free to ask and discuss freely in the comments regarding games whether you want advice on what to play, want to give advice to others on what to play, share a hidden gem you found, discussions & questions about discounts, sales, events, or just general games discussion.",

            "I posted one already, so forgive me for posting again, but:\n\n  \nI want a game whose story will make me cry. It doesn't happen much, and it sometimes happens with weird stuff.\n\n  \nWhat Remains of Edith Finch made me cry. That one part of Final Fantasy XV made me cry (\"You guys are the best.\"). To the Moon. Maybe Life is Strange? I don't remember.  NieR: Automata made me cry over a robot with a bucket.\n\n  \nI teared up at the end of the Undertale (pacifist) from a combination of things: I knew it was made by just a few people, it seemed pretty tightly-made, it surprised me a bit, and it was a fun bit of...what do I call it? Neo-nostalgia? That.\n\n  \nI cried for a bit with Final Fantasy VII, back in 1997. Not so much the new stuff.\n\n  \n...hope that helps?",
            "If you dig romance stuff, please try \"Tales of Arise\". I've had a blast playing it! It's rough around the edges, true, but the story is very well-written. If you are a hopeless romantic like myself, you should give this game a shot :)",
            "I want something like fallout/far cry. Fun single player FPS games where I can put ton of hours in.",
            "Hi :) My mom always sees me and my brother on our computers and she also wants to start playing computer games, however she's not into what we are so I'm not sure what to search for.\n\nI've made a new Steam account just for her where I've added Snood to her library (she LOVES Snood), and Mahjong and similar. She's also really into BTS Island: In The Seom, and other \"easier\" games.\n\nDoes anybody have any cheap recommendations on Steam, or another place I can search on as well?\n\nThanks in advance :)",
            "Are there any eyetoy-esque titles on Steam that utilize your Webcam for gameplay?\n\nWhat about games requiring mic input?",
            "I'd like to ask you good demos that you have tried in this Next Fest. So far, I have enjoyed many of them:\n\n* Waltz and Jam (adventure and accion)\n* Ruins to Fortress (Post-apocalyptic, craft, build, tear down enemy bases)\n* Mind over Magnet (a very well done puzzle game)\n* Iron Meat (great metroidvania)\n* Caravan Sandwitch (adventure)\n* Big Boy Boxing (sports)\n* Medal winners 24 (sports)\n\nPlease suggest me in these genres (adventure, acction, post apocaliptic, puzzle, metroidvania and sports).",
            "Homeworld 3 was pretty good.\n\nV Rising has been fun.\n\nGhost of Tsushima is at its best on Steam.",

            "Any recommendations for a visual novel/time management game that doesn\u2019t feature romance? Someone recommended me the quintessential quintuplets game and I really like the aspect of giving them tasks (time management) but don\u2019t necessarily want to play a dating sim. A lot of dating sims fall under this but I\u2019m looking for something more SFW. There are a couple others that sort of fit this description like the cafe simulators but I don\u2019t want to be on a real-time timer, I\u2019m looking for something slower paced.\n\nI guess the closest thing might be Life is Strange, but was wondering if there was anything out there that fits this description. Probably just a SFW visual novel that\u2019s more geared towards friendships rather than lovers?"

I booted it up today and now it refuses to acknowledge my mouse input. I can see that the program is working because there's a slight animation around the selected game thing, but it won't let me click on anything. I can exit out with ESC just fine.\n\nThe only thing I could think of is that Pacific Drive has controller support, so maybe it expects me to have a controller suddenly? But I don't and have never used a controller with Steamlink.\n\n  \nEDIT: so it looks like I can still stream with the steam app itself, which is working correctly. It just needs me to have my PC be awake in order to recognize it, which turning on the steamlink ironically does.",

All of this happened while I was at work. I have been trying to deal with support to get this refunded and they say by their policy, I am responsible for anyone who uses my account, but that's just it, she doesn't use my account nor is she allowed too. She used it without my permission and purchased things. I don't see how this is different to someone else gaining access to my account and buying games using my card.",

I'm hearing about friends getting banned for 1-2 days on different community hubs for odd reasons (e.g., posting a basic topic/question that a community mod deems off-topic). Then if they have 2+ several day bans they get banned from contributing to all steam community hubs for 2+ weeks.\n\nIs this a special case or has steam introduced some new banning mode across their communities? \n\nI read their \"banned\" comments, and steams guidelines and they barely seemed off-topic. Odd to have a ban without any kind of warning. Is there any chance they are being stalked by bots and getting auto-reported on whatever they are posting?",
            "Hi! The two games I\u2019d like to get have gone on sale, but someone in a different subreddit told me that summer sales start on 27th June. \n\n\nI\u2019m not really in a rush to get them now if I can get them cheaper a bit later on (on 27th June), they are Hogwarts Legacy (50% off) and Stray (34% off). \n\n\nDid you ever see these two games be more discounted than this? Hogwarts discount lasts until 10th June and Stray until 3rd. Should I get them now or will there be a bigger sale at the end of this month? \n\n\nAlso how exactly does buying games on steam work because I\u2019m really new to it. From what I saw you sadly don\u2019t just buy the game, you have to put money into your wallet so I\u2019ll have to put more than the needed amount, right? Also I\u2019m not from the US, but I think it still shows the games\u2019 prices in $, will I pay a bit more since they will need to get converted from my currency to $? \n\n\nThank you so much!"
