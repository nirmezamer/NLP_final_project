            "Where can I find a map showing availability by area?    I ordered over a year ago and still waiting.   Also a little irritated when I see people with other high speed isp options getting starlink before me and I'm stuck with 1.5Mbps dsl.  I digress....",
            "Anyone else frustrated that you are still stuck on mid 2022?",
            "Why is the SE USA just not getting any coverage? I'm a day 1 pre-orderer and I still haven't heard anything. Our status still says \"Mid 2022\" but that's highly doubtful.",
            "Ordered last year Feb 08/2021. Friend of mine 20 min away Ordered Feb 25th  he got his first. I'm still waiting. Infuriating.",
            "Just got our Starlink, booting was scary, but eventually it did it's thing, 4 hours in, and running like a champ, I've been traumatized by shoddy wireless service for the past five years, this whole, \"stable\" internet thing is like a wonderful dream, that I'm constantly waiting to end in catastrophe.   I am 100% happy with it so far and am super impressed.    I needed a place to say as much, thank you for reading :)",
            "I submitted my deposit in February 2021first it said Mid 2021, then late 2021, then mid 2022it still says mid 2022 and we are halfway through August. Feels like Ill never get away from <1-3mbps",
            "20% price hike in less than a year for an already expensive service. Pretty damn annoyed right now. I fully expected another increase but I figured they would stagger them out a bit more. They will push these prices as far as they think they can get away with.",
            "Should the \"New $500 Order\" flair be changed to reflect the new price?",
            "Was able to put in an order and said my starlink kit should ship within 2 weeks! Im geeked right now. Finally have some decent internet in the rural area where I live!",
