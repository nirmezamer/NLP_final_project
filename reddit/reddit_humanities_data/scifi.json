I\u2019m really intrigued to learn more about the world of Hyperion and the shrike, but I\u2019m wondering how do the sequels compare? Are they as good as the first novel and would you recommend reading them?",

            "Fall of Hyperion is the Dune 2 of the first two books.  Large Time jump for the remaining two.  All good but fall of Hyperion is my personal favorite",
            "You will probably like the second book just as much as the first. As for the second two books, I thought they were much worse than the first two but there are those who enjoy it just as much. It is probably better to think of it as a duology and a sequel duology than a four-book series.",
            "Everything gets weirder before anything makes sense then everything makes sense",
            "It's probably better to consider Fall of Hyperion as the direct sequel. Endymion and Rise of Endymion I think of as more like \"related stories in the same universe\".\n\nThe other 2 books(Endymion) are sequels the same way that say, Lord of the Rings is a sequel to The Hobbit. Which is to say, it isn't really. They are tonally different, and are directly related, but they aren't direct continuations of the stories unless you take a really odd perspective (i.e. LoTRs is only a direct continuation from the perspective of the One ring, and Endymion is only a direct continuation from the perspective of the baby).",
            "Fall of Hyperion basically finished the story from Hyperion, it\u2019s technically one book. I haven\u2019t read 3 and 4 yet but Fall is a must read.",
            "Fall of Hyperion is a good book. \n\nMy only problem with it has been author's over-pandering to his presumably favourite poet, so much so that by the end of the book the story revolves around him. My god Simmons, if I wanted to read Keats, I would have been reading Keats.",
            "You have to read Fall of Hyperion if you want to know what happens next. Endymion and its sequel are a different story set in the same universe with some returning characters. Reading the last two books doesn\u2019t make the first two any better but I liked the last two books more than the first two. \n\nIf you love the world building and the setting then the remaining three books will get better and better as more of it is revealed. I found the last two books to have much more action on the whole but it isn\u2019t sprinkled throughout it is concentrated in some well placed scenes to show the carnage in detail.",
            "I really enjoyed Hyperion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMidway through the second book I thought to myself - the author is 100%an English teacher.\n\n\nPaused to look him up. He is.\u00a0",

            "Fall of Hyperion is excellent.\n\nThe Endymion books have fascinating concepts but I don't love the story. There is also an extremely uncomfortable theme in those books that I won't harp on, but people who have read them know exactly what I'm referring to."

The combatants experience time dilation, so they go out on missions and come back centuries later to a profound culture shock.  This might fit your bill.\n\nHaldeman served in the Vietnam war, and the book was informed by his experiences there.

It's *Project Hail Mary*. Yes, I also admit that it's not as cerebral as *God Emperor of Dune* (which I adore) or even Azimov's *Foundation* series. And it's not everyone's cup of tea. But if I were to recommend a good recent novel, this would be it. Thank you for all of the responses, fellow nerds. Cheers!",
