            "Fall of Hyperion is a good book. \n\nMy only problem with it has been author's over-pandering to his presumably favourite poet, so much so that by the end of the book the story revolves around him. My god Simmons, if I wanted to read Keats, I would have been reading Keats.",
            "Fall of Hyperion is excellent.\n\nThe Endymion books have fascinating concepts but I don't love the story. There is also an extremely uncomfortable theme in those books that I won't harp on, but people who have read them know exactly what I'm referring to.",

            "I loved the first two and see the second as a must for the closure of the story in the first one. But I hated the last two books, and they are completely skippable",

            "What did you like about Hyperion? Was it the narrative style of the story. Lots of folks like the comparison to Canterbury Tales of Hyperion. \nI like the story, including the final 2 books. But they don't have the CT method anymore .\nI actually cried at the end of book four once a certain plot realization became clear.",
            "The other three are not terribly similar to the first.  Hyperion is a scifi Canterbury Tales and follows a similar theme of the pilgrims\u2019 stories, where the other three kind of just tell the rest of the story the first one set up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the other three are bad, even now they are together some of my favorite works of fiction (not just scifi but all fiction), but Hyperion kind of stands alone in the way it\u2019s structured and how the story is told, where the others are simply more episodic."

        "content": "So you have all probably heard about the Fermi Paradox which asks the question: \"How come Earth has not been visited or contacted by aliens?\" Many experts have provided answers from the Zoo hypothesis, which states that aliens have a prime directive that prevents them from contacting primitive civilizations, to the Dark Forest Theory, where aliens destroy all other forms of intelligent life to prevent them from becoming a threat. But while I was browsing TV Tropes I found an article on how to [create believable aliens](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/CreateBelievableAliens). And it said that one of the key things about creating believable **spacefaring** aliens is that their civilization must have the ability to create metal.\n\nAnd that's when I had a light bulb moment.\n\nWhat if one of the reasons, why aliens have not made contact with us is because they have not surpassed our level of technological development? And the explanation for this is because they live on a planet that have conditions that are not conducive for the creation of metal. I mean this makes a lot of sense in theory. A lot of planets may not have the necessary raw materials to create metal like iron and copper ores. And since most planets are not [Earthlike](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPlanetsAreEarthLike) their atmosphere might not have the necessary oxygen content, or the necessary natural oxidzers (fluorine, flammable vegetation etc.), to create fire. Or their atmosphere has too much oxygen which means creating fire would be too dangerous for them \\[1, 2,3,4,5\\]\n\nOf course, just because they aren't able to develop spaceships, that doesn't necessarily mean they cannot develop other forms of technology or develop a system of agriculture. According to Isaac Arthur it is still possible for the aliens to still learn how to domesticate animals and grow crops and develop tools and inventions like knives and plows from natural materials like obsidian and bone. They can also use animal hides and natural vegetation that can be used as substitutes for ceramics to store food and drink \\[3\\]. And according to John Michael Godier, since fire is not invented there is a good chance that instead of having the alien version of cereal grasses (rice, wheat, rye, and oats) the aliens agriculture will resolve around the alien version of legumes and root vegetables as their staples \\[2\\].  But without fire to cook their food the aliens must evolve with the ability to get the necessary nutrients and energy they need from raw foods.\n\nIn summary I'm looking for works of fiction about aliens who have not advanced past the stone age because they live on a planet that is either:\n\n* A. Poor in raw materials needed to develop metal technology.\n* B. Has environmental conditions that make it impossible for the aliens to create fire.\n* C. Both\n\n1.
