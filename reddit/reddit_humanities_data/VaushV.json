            "I feel like its worth the risk, bidens still not officially nominated, and both him and trump are generally wildly unpopular, with people especially upset about both candidates ages, swapping biden on for a younger candidate might not be as unwise as it sounds \n\nMy hope would be Gretchen, i think her as a candidate would go a long way in securing that state, which isnt looking very great for Biden to begin with (large muslim population), and its a necessary state for the dems to win",
            "Mate, Ive seen you around the block for a while and you usually have great takes. But this is your worst one. Nobody has the name recognition Biden does, and to the white undecided moderate, thats a major factor in who they vote for. Regardless, youre not going to make voters more passionate by constantly complaining about Bidens age rather than his Admins and his accomplishments. Whats gonna lead to a Trump win is not him convincing people to vote for him, its convincing people to not vote at all.",
            "Exactly. I think the best course of action is for Biden to get some great sleep, get some cold medicine, recalibrate his brain, and memorize his script better and he is pretty much good to go. This is a conversation that should have started *all the way back in 2020.*\n\nThe risk is way too high now. It would be like Humphrey V Nixon as I said earlier. It would be catastrophic. Biden just needs to charge up and get ready for the battle against convicted felon Donald Trump this September and clean house.",
            "Agreed. I think that people are assuming the general principles that we tend to come together on will still work here, but the American presidential election isnt like anything our friends on the other side of the pond deal with.",
            "Thankfully my takes are based around what I think, not what other people think, so call it and ass option or whatever I don't really care, I'm not changing my mind on this",
            "I think script memorization was actually part of the problem. There was too much prep for a debate in which facts did not matter, and him trying to remember all that shit fouled him up, mixed with the cold plus, well, age does slow you down a bit. Still not fucking dementia, though. \n\nBiden's always done shit at the formal stuff, but let him go off the cuff and he beats ass. As they say, let Joe be Joe.",
            "Absolutely. Biden is absolutely spectacular at improv and off the cuff stuff. That is absolutely one of his best advantages over Trump. Give him some rest and he be throwing out zingers like there is no tomorrow.",

Freaking out and begging him to step down only weakens his inevitable position. Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans fall in line.\n\nIf we want to win, we need to convince people that Joe Biden is the best choice, even if we don\u2019t 100% agree with it.\n\nI\u2019m sure we all have younger, more left wing people we\u2019d want to run. I know I do.\n\nBut they\u2019re not running. Biden is what we have and we\u2019ve got to get him over the finish line. \n\nThe alternative is unimaginable suffering.",

We should let Biden relax, rest up a bit, do better in the second debate in September, have him win in November hopefully and for 2028, we will have an entire repertoire of probably really good, younger, and more progressive candidates to choose from.\n\nStay strong everyone.

            "Man, he really hurt him with the Herbert Hoover nickname.   \n  \nIn all seriousness, he does sound better than yesterday, but to cross that bar, he just didn't have to sound like he was literally dead. He still sounds old and weak. I know plenty of people who have looked and acted like they were about 60 until they turned about 79, at which point they seemed to age thirty years all at once. Seems to be the same thing here. I really do believe that this is the most important election we've had since 1860 and I'm sick to my stomach that this is who our option is.",
            "While this is nice, I still think that Biden needs to retire and pass the torch to someone else. While there is some risk in having an open convention, I feel it would be way better to get someone who would be younger and more consistent. I dont feel comfortable the Dems gambling our democracy, hoping that Biden doesnt crap out like he did during the debate.",

Even MAGA people I know were getting annoyed of how he would never actually answer a question.\n\nThe goal of the presidential debate is to sway undecideds your way, and its pretty clear that both candidates failed at their goals. Bidens failure was just a little more obvious.",
            "This actually shows the debate had an effect. Did you seriously think there would be a 20 point swing.  Biden losing a couple percent points is more than enough for him to lose the election.",
            "That little change amount concerns me because its exactly doing what I thought itd do: Biden would lose some share, Trump would barely budge forward, and most of the share Biden loses goes to RFK. A 1-1.5 point swing can be the difference in the swing states and that is all Trump needs.",
            "Plus we have the Trump sentencing coming up soon, thatll likely have a larger impact and somewhat and take some attention away from this, and the next two weeks in politics are going to be incredibly dense, I think its quite likely this is somewhat forgotten in that time",
