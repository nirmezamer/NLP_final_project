So its overturning is symbolic, but still good news.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Namibian courts also declared that a same-sex marriage performed had to be recognized by the government. Hopefully, this momentum will continue and broader protections for LGBT people will be put in place.",

Used to be an aggressive, passionate fitness personality who was actually very empathetic and seemed to just want what was best for folks, but then went insane when Covid happened and started basically implying that if you got sick, it was on you for not prioritising your health/fitness enough\u2026.then proceeded to try and arrange an exclusive unmasked cruise (you know, in the middle of a plague).\n\nI think the roids must eventually rot all these dudes brains.",
