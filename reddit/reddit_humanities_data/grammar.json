        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThere has been a recent increase in comments using ChatGPT or other AI programs to answer questions in this sub. Unfortunately, these programs are not at all reliable when it comes to grammar questions (or any questions really). Some regular contributors to r/grammar have discussed the shortcomings of AI programs (mostly ChatGPT) - they have given me permission to use the quotes below (but have asked to remain anonymous):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*OpenAI*\u00a0says\u00a0*ChatGPT*\u00a0was released in order to \"get users\u2019 feedback and learn about its strengths and\u00a0*weaknesses*.\" The prompt page warns users that ChatGPT \"may occasionally generate incorrect information\" and \"may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.\u201d  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>ChatGPT's goal is to learn to produce speech equivalent to, and indistinguishable from, that of a human. ChatGPT's current goal is\u00a0*not*\u00a0to become a reliable source of information. (If\u00a0*that*\u00a0were its goal, they would allow it to access the huge libraries of information it is connected to. But that is not the current research goal.) \u30fc I\u00a0*believe*\u00a0they have set it to occasionally make small mistakes, intentionally, in order to assess how the public reacts to these occasional errors (does the public blindly believe them/if the public challenges ChatGPT on these errors, can the program successfully handle these challenges well?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here is an example of an incorrect (or at the very best, incomplete/misleading) answer that ChatGPT gave to a pretty straightforward grammar question:\n\nThe question: \u201cShould I use \u2018that\u2019 or \u2018which\u2019 in the following sentence?: \u2018This is the house that/which I like.\u2019\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s answer:\n\n>Both \"that\" and \"which\" can be used in this sentence, but the choice depends on whether the information following the word is essential or non-essential to the sentence.  \n>  \n>If the information is essential to the sentence and needed to identify the specific house you like, use \"that\". For example, \"This is the house that I like\" implies that there are other houses and you are identifying which one you like.  \n>  \n>If the information is non-essential and simply provides additional information about the house, use \"which\". For example, \"This is the house, which I like\" implies that there is only one house and you are adding a comment about it.  \n>  \n>So, in this case, if you want to emphasize that this particular house is the one you like, use \"that\". If you want to add an additional comment about the house, use \"which\".\n\nThe correct/complete answer:\n\nBoth \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d are grammatically correct in that sentence as written (without a comma) because without the comma, the relative clause is integrated, and both \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d can be used in integrated relative clauses. However, \u201cthat\u201d will be strongly preferred in American English (both \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d are used about equally in integrated relative clauses in British English).\n\nIf you were to add a comma before the relative clause (making it supplementary), only \u201cwhich\u201d would be acceptable in today\u2019s English.\n\nChatGPT also fails to mention that integrated relative clauses are not always essential to the meaning of the sentence and do not always serve to identify exactly what is being talked about (though that is probably their most common use) - it can be up to the writer to decide whether to make a relative clause integrated or supplementary. A writer might decide to integrate the relative clause simply to show that they feel the info is important to the overall meaning of the sentence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, to get to the point: Comments that quote AI programs are not permitted in this sub and will be removed. If you *must* use one of these programs to start your research on a certain topic, please be sure to verify (using other reliable sources) that the answer is accurate, and please write your answer in your own words.\n\nThank you!",

            "Good example\n\nQ to chatGPT: The first five vowels make sense, but why is y sometimes considered a vowel? --\n\nA from chatGPT: Y is sometimes considered a vowel because it can function as a vowel in certain words and situations. Specifically, y is considered a vowel when it appears at the end of a word, and there is no other vowel in the word that comes after it.\n\nFor example, in the word \"myth,\" the y at the end of the word functions as a vowel, because it is pronounced like the vowel \"i.\"  --\n\nSummary, the y in myth comes at the end of the word",
            "Good to know that, what about Grammarly tools? Is that considered AI powered responses?",
            "Counterpoint: Answers from users here are also often wrong, and should also be verified. But you can use their answer as a starting point for discussion, to ask questions, and to get pointed in the right direction for the correct answer.\n\nSo while it can be wrong with it's answers, it also can be right. This feels no different from the commenters here. And when it is wrong, commenters can come in and correct it (what's the saying? The best way to get a right answer from a crowd is to purposefully provide the wrong answer?). And hopefully the person posting the comment has enough sense to not post a comment when it provides outright nonsense (which it will do from time to time).\n\nI guess my point is, not sure why a tool that can often be very informative might be outlawed when the community should be able to kind of wrangle it in on it's own. Will it still be banned in a year when a new version comes out that's even more accurate and more useful? Or the year after that when even more improvements occur?",
            "Yes, it is true. I, as an English teacher, often use chat gpt to help me to write a short story for my students or make a quiz.

            "Instead of creating a new thread I will just comment here.  \n\nRecently Bing AI told me the word \"present\" (I present to you) turns from verb to a noun when used with an entity. Example \n\"Live Nation Presents\" \n\nAI says it now becomes a part of that entity. \n\n\nI asked it several times using several examples and it kept giving me the same answer",
            "Perfect. Here's another good one: I asked it \"Why is this sentence grammatically incorrect: \"It confuses people about the reality\"? (an actual question raised in this sub a little while ago, btw) and got the following, somewhat surreal response: \n\n>The sentence \"It confuses people about the reality\" is not grammatically  \n incorrect. However, it could be improved by using the definite article   \n\"the\" before \"reality\" to make it clearer. The revised sentence would   \nbe: \"It confuses people about the reality.\"\n\nIn other words, ChatGPT thinks my sentence could be improved by restating it, verbatim.\n\nI gave it another chance, and its second attempt was even worse: \n\n>The sentence \"It confuses people about the reality\" is grammatically   \nincorrect because it lacks a definite article before the noun \"reality.\"  \n In English, when referring to a specific object or concept, we   \ntypically use an article such as \"the.\" Therefore, the correct form of   \nthe sentence would be: \"It confuses people about the reality.\"\n\nSo, for all those anti-humanists out there who are just itching for the day that the machines all rise up against us and take over the planet by turning everything into paperclips... Your wait might be longer than expected.",
            "Grammarly is not very reliable/accurate (especially when it comes to punctuation). At best, it may be helpful for specific genres of writing (e.g., very formal writing where strict adherence to certain grammar rules and punctuation conventions is expected).\n\nIn general, it would not be acceptable to answer questions here using *just* Grammarly, although it could be one source (as long as you verify that what it says is correct)."

Thanks,",
            "What's the correct sub for linguistic/grammatical pet peeves?",
            "This seems like a mistake to me. Your comments in this topic specifically welcome prescriptive usage content, of the kind that an editor might employ. Someone who needs to know that information, e.g. because they have some need to conform to what such an editor expects, might reasonably hope to find lists of pet peeves here to be learned from and used to get better at that kind of English by avoiding ways in which their usage differs from editorial standards (sometimes called \"mistakes\"). Even if they don't come here specifically looking for it, it's easy to imagine people looking for help might notice and browse such a list.\n\nIt would, as a side benefit, allow people like me who see (what we consider) new and increasing usage problems the ability to warn others in hope that those problems might be reduced somewhat in prevalence, at least among people whose writing seems to indicate that they might care about such things.\n\nI'm not saying that rants about degradation of Western culture should be tolerated. There is no reason that the two should go hand in hand, and I have zero interest in either reading or posting them. But people should be able to post warnings for others who might appreciate a word of caution on a subreddit called \"grammar.\" The very fact that, in these comments, nobody had an obvious alternative location for pet peeves is a big clue.\n\nIf you don't want pet peeve posts to overrun the sub, the obvious solution would be to create a designated sticky post for them. Instead of calling it \"the pet peeve post,\" you could pick a name that isn't obviously intended to disparage and discourage them, such as \"new usage problems\" or whatever academic-sounding name you choose. You can dictate a format for top-level comments that makes the list easy to scan. Replies can be restricted to verification, challenge, academic discussion, or whatever. Successful challenges should be subject to removing the TLC.\n\nForbidding what you call pet peeve content only makes the subreddit a little bit less useful. I believe that you believe it's for the best, but in fact you've merely traded linguistic purism for academic purism.",

            ">Wait, why does this sub lean descriptive? That seems more appropriate for a linguistics oriented subreddit.\n\nYou'd have to ask the creators exactly why, but that has always been the spirit of the sub - you can see this reflected in the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/wiki/rules/). Edit: Apparently this wasn\u2019t always how the sub operated (see u/bfootdav\u2019s excellent comment below), but it has had a descriptive focus for at least as long as I\u2019ve been here (4 years).\n\nWe do delve into/encourage linguistic analysis, and again, this is mentioned in the rules:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Base your explanation on evidence.  \n>  \n>Look at how native English speakers use the language. Look at how writers use the language. Look at what the experts say: How do linguists analyze this issue, and/or what do the style guides say?\n\nThis approach is more \"holistic\" - it's not one narrow approach to grammar. It allows posters and commenters to learn more about language and discuss it in depth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For context, I'm an editor. I've worked in both in-house agency corporate advertising with native speakers, and in software development with teams of native speakers and EFL/ESL speakers. When I hit grammar with users in either context, I'm leaning heavily prescriptive so that we can get everyone on the same page. That strikes me as exactly the purview of grammar.\n\nDescriptive grammar is grammar too. But prescriptive answers are certainly welcome here, especially if they are more appropriate for the OP's question, or if the OP specifically asks for them. Top-level answers are encouraged to give both perspectives though, and most questions certainly benefit from both.\n\nWhat's not welcome here is complaining about nonstandard or informal constructions that someone believes are incorrect, or saying that speakers who use those constructions are ignorant or uneducated.\n\nSo I mentioned descriptive grammar in my OP mainly because that is more relevant to the type of pet-peeve posts we get here. But actually, some of them are about Standard English constructions that people have been misled into believing are incorrect, usually by fake prescriptive rules.\n\nYour approach is necessary and appropriate in the setting you use it in. But many English learners and native speakers want to know how the language is used in various contexts, and this means discussing informal and even nonstandard constructions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Many of the questions here seem to originate with people from non-Anglophone backgrounds who are either trying to get Reddit to do their homework for them, or who haven't worked out some of the ways that English functions. (I'm not talking about terminal prepositions or the less/fewer debate.)\n\nI'd say at *least* a third of the questions we get here are about informal or uncommon Standard English constructions, or nonstandard ones. Even basic questions about how English functions benefit from both a prescriptive and a descriptive answer because the OP will likely encounter different usages in different settings.\n\nHomework questions (at least obvious ones) are fairly infrequent and we ask posters to make an attempt first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How does providing a mishmash of sometimes-acceptable use cases with little useful context help these users?\n\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean here, but if you've ever read any of my answers (or those of other trusted commenters here), you'll see that they almost always cover both perspectives, provide plenty of context, a thorough explanation, and usually a reliable source or two.",
            "You seem to be making a distinction between linguistics and grammar that doesn't actually exist. Grammar is part of linguistics. A subreddit about grammar is intrinstically linguistics-oriented.\n\nIt's not uncommon for there to be questions from ESL speakers (or even sometimes from native speakers too) along the lines of \"My grammar book says X is correct, but why do native speakers actually say Y?\"\n\nThat question can't correctly be answered with prescriptive grammar alone. If you don't explain the descriptive grammar, an ESL speaker is never going to know how and when to distinguish it from the prescriptive grammar that they're actually targetting.",
            "> How does providing a mishmash of sometimes-acceptable use cases with little useful context help these users?\n\nI will say that I don't read every post on this sub, so maybe this happens.  However, much of the time, users will provide lots of useful context.  You see a lot of comments that say things like, \"Traditional grammar texts say X, but you'll often hear people say Y.\"  \n\nIf you want a sub that only does nuance-free standard-English editing, this is probably not the sub you want.  \n\nWhat OP is talking about is all the posts that are just like \"SOMEONE SAID 'I SEEN' AND IT ANNOYED ME\".  Again, if you want all the comments just to say \"Yeah that's wrong and everyone who says it is stupid,\" this is probably not the sub for you.  I don't think anyone here would advise using \"I seen\" in edited prose, but we (most of us) are also not just going to say that saying \"I seen\" is proof that you are uneducated because we know language use is more complex than that.  \n\nAgain, if that is not something you're interested in, this is probably not the sub for you.",
            "We are perfectly capable of pointing out when something wouldn't be acceptable in a formal or academic environment, i.e. identifying when prescriptivism is useful or relevant.",
            "I'm going to add a bit to /u/Boglin007's answer.\n\n> Wait, why does this sub lean descriptive?\n\nIn the very earliest days it didn't. It was very much about preserving the purity of the English language as defined by each individual's preferred style guide or whatever their teacher taught them in school. And it was full of people saying that if you wrote/spoke a certain thing in a certain way that meant you were uneducated, semi-literate, illiterate, destroying Western culture, and so on.\n\nSo then there was a big battle for the soul of the sub and basically a new approach evolved that requires giving people the answer they need (or think they need) while also providing more depth. The assumption is that people are here to learn and not just be given arbitrary answers that might be correct in some contexts but not others but are treated as universally correct.\n\nIt was also decided that answers should have sources or at least demonstrate good knowledge of the specific subject.\n\nOf course most of the sub is still made up of the kind of people I talked about at the very beginning, but the moderator enforces this better approach.\n\n> When I hit grammar with users in either context, I'm leaning heavily prescriptive so that we can get everyone on the same page. That strikes me as exactly the purview of grammar.\n\nOk, but context does matter. Many so-called issues of \"grammar\" are actually ones of style. Many of the people who push the prescriptive approach are unaware that other styles exist and are just as valid (see serial commas for one example). The more thoughtful research-based answers can account for different contexts (dialects, for eg) and differences in style and provide a well-rounded answer.\n\nAs an editor, you typically have a house style guide that you *must* follow and enforce in others. That is a different type of situation than what the OP is talking about. \n\n> How does providing a mishmash of sometimes-acceptable use cases with little useful context help these users?\n\nCan you give examples of this? From what I see, the best answers provide all the necessary context and understanding of the issue whereas the prescriptive answers are often based on each person's vague memories of their grammar school teacher insisting on things like \"May I go to the bathroom?\" vs \"Can I go to the bathroom?\" and assuming that the former is a chiseled-in-stone Rule of Grammar handed down from upon High. We can do much better than that.\n\nAnd the point is not to provide examples of rare exceptions but to help the OP understand that different ways of talking/speaking are not necessarily a result of illiteracy or lack of education but often come down to dialectical differences. Helping the OP not be quite so condescending is in itself a goal worth pursuing. Letting the OP leave with the impression that yeah, all *those* kinds of people really are stupid and uneducated and are destroying Western culture with their illiterate slang should not count as a success in a sub devoted to grammar."
