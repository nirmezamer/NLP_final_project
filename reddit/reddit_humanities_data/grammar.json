        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThere has been a recent increase in comments using ChatGPT or other AI programs to answer questions in this sub. Unfortunately, these programs are not at all reliable when it comes to grammar questions (or any questions really). Some regular contributors to r/grammar have discussed the shortcomings of AI programs (mostly ChatGPT) - they have given me permission to use the quotes below (but have asked to remain anonymous):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*OpenAI*\u00a0says\u00a0*ChatGPT*\u00a0was released in order to \"get users\u2019 feedback and learn about its strengths and\u00a0*weaknesses*.\" The prompt page warns users that ChatGPT \"may occasionally generate incorrect information\" and \"may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.\u201d  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>ChatGPT's goal is to learn to produce speech equivalent to, and indistinguishable from, that of a human. ChatGPT's current goal is\u00a0*not*\u00a0to become a reliable source of information. (If\u00a0*that*\u00a0were its goal, they would allow it to access the huge libraries of information it is connected to. But that is not the current research goal.) \u30fc I\u00a0*believe*\u00a0they have set it to occasionally make small mistakes, intentionally, in order to assess how the public reacts to these occasional errors (does the public blindly believe them/if the public challenges ChatGPT on these errors, can the program successfully handle these challenges well?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here is an example of an incorrect (or at the very best, incomplete/misleading) answer that ChatGPT gave to a pretty straightforward grammar question:\n\nThe question: \u201cShould I use \u2018that\u2019 or \u2018which\u2019 in the following sentence?: \u2018This is the house that/which I like.\u2019\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s answer:\n\n>Both \"that\" and \"which\" can be used in this sentence, but the choice depends on whether the information following the word is essential or non-essential to the sentence.  \n>  \n>If the information is essential to the sentence and needed to identify the specific house you like, use \"that\". For example, \"This is the house that I like\" implies that there are other houses and you are identifying which one you like.  \n>  \n>If the information is non-essential and simply provides additional information about the house, use \"which\". For example, \"This is the house, which I like\" implies that there is only one house and you are adding a comment about it.  \n>  \n>So, in this case, if you want to emphasize that this particular house is the one you like, use \"that\". If you want to add an additional comment about the house, use \"which\".\n\nThe correct/complete answer:\n\nBoth \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d are grammatically correct in that sentence as written (without a comma) because without the comma, the relative clause is integrated, and both \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d can be used in integrated relative clauses. However, \u201cthat\u201d will be strongly preferred in American English (both \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d are used about equally in integrated relative clauses in British English).\n\nIf you were to add a comma before the relative clause (making it supplementary), only \u201cwhich\u201d would be acceptable in today\u2019s English.\n\nChatGPT also fails to mention that integrated relative clauses are not always essential to the meaning of the sentence and do not always serve to identify exactly what is being talked about (though that is probably their most common use) - it can be up to the writer to decide whether to make a relative clause integrated or supplementary. A writer might decide to integrate the relative clause simply to show that they feel the info is important to the overall meaning of the sentence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, to get to the point: Comments that quote AI programs are not permitted in this sub and will be removed. If you *must* use one of these programs to start your research on a certain topic, please be sure to verify (using other reliable sources) that the answer is accurate, and please write your answer in your own words.\n\nThank you!",

            "Grammarly is not very reliable/accurate (especially when it comes to punctuation). At best, it may be helpful for specific genres of writing (e.g., very formal writing where strict adherence to certain grammar rules and punctuation conventions is expected).\n\nIn general, it would not be acceptable to answer questions here using *just* Grammarly, although it could be one source (as long as you verify that what it says is correct).",

            "A lot of people who think that artificial intelligence is here, probably aren't considering that we're still dealing with a very creative narrow AI, there's been no evidence of general AI in any of the products that anybody has shown off.",

            "I'd say you're definitely in the clear, my friend!",
            "None whatsoever, because general AI is a very long way off, assuming it's even possible. The other day I saw Noam Chomsky (who appears to be hanging on by sheer strength of will these days) asked about just this issue, and he described ChatGPT as \"a glorified auto-correct program, not really different in kind from the one on your phone.\" This is probably the best characterization I've heard of it, so far. I really don't see it being an issue on this website.",
            "The authoritative way in which ChatGPT presents incorrect information is an issue, but Im almost more frustrated by the way people react to ChatGPTs answers. Something about it being an AI program on your computer seems to make a lot of people more willing to believe what it sayslike its this incomprehensible greater power that can understand and synthesize all of human knowledge instead of what it actually is: a predictive text algorithm that Googles things.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThere has been a recent uptick in \u201cpet peeve\u201d posts, so this is just a reminder that r/grammar is not the appropriate sub for this type of post.\n\nThe vast majority of these pet peeves are easily explained as nonstandard constructions, i.e., grammatical in dialects other than Standard English, or as spelling errors based on pronunciation (e.g., \u201cshould of\u201d).\n\nAlso remember that this sub has a primarily descriptive focus - we look at how native speakers (of all dialects of English) actually use their language.\n\nSo if your post consists of something like, \u201cI hate this - it\u2019s wrong and sounds uneducated. Who else hates it?,\u201d the post will be removed.\n\nThe only pet-peeve-type posts that will not be removed are ones that focus mainly on the origin and usage, etc., of the construction, i.e., posts that seek some kind of meaningful discussion. So you might say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t love this construction, but I\u2019m curious about it - what dialects feature it, and how it is used?\u201d\n\nThank you!",

            "I'm glad this was pinned to the top.  I've never posted here and came to ask why people have started saying \"myself\" almost exclusively when they mean to say \"I\" or \"me\".  It didn't used to be this way, but I've noticed this has pretty much become the default within the last couple years.  Anyway, kind of comes off as a pet peeve, so declining to create a post.  Thanks,",
            "What's the correct sub for linguistic/grammatical pet peeves?",
            "We are perfectly capable of pointing out when something wouldn't be acceptable in a formal or academic environment, i.e. identifying when prescriptivism is useful or relevant.",
            "Well, there used to be a \"Grammar Nazi\" sub that was fairly active, but that closed a couple months ago. I just did a search, and there are a couple of other subs with a similar name, but they haven't been active in years. I know that r/PetPeeves gets a lot of grammar-themed posts.",
            "In other words: geek out and discuss how words are used, don't whine about grammar mistakes.",
            "Nothing against Moderator Boglin's answer, but this was more useful. \n\nI was asking in part because I do sometimes answer questions if I feel like they're within my wheelhouse and I'm not doing homework or submitting a corrected exam answer. However, because of my background, I'm always going to lean more prescriptive, so I was taken aback  made to feel unwelcome even though I do try not to be a dick in this particular sub.",
            "What about a grammar sub that is prescriptive instead of descriptive?",
            "People complaining about grammar pet peeves does not *inevitably* lead to people lamenting the supposed ''downfall of Western civilization''. That's a stretch. We know that prescriptivist guidance is tolerated here, as e.g. u/jenea pointed out, so I'm not sure why you're basing your position solely on that assumption. People can be annoyed by non-standard usage without all of that.",
            "Hi. Mod here. My OP was only directed at those who make (or are thinking of making) pet-peeve posts, so if you are not one of those people (and it definitely sounds like youre not), you should not feel unwelcome here. As I said, its fine to give prescriptive answers, especially to questions where a prescriptive answer is more appropriate. I would still encourage you to mention if usage in less formal contexts differs though. \n\nJust curious: I assume you read the rules when you first started frequenting the sub - is there anything there that made you feel unwelcome as someone with a more prescriptivist approach? Id like to be aware and fix it if necessary. Thanks.",
            "Its not that prescriptive answers are not welcome hereon the contrary! But its a question of understanding language in context. If you are specifically looking for a prescriptive answer, just ask for it. For example: What is the answer that would be expected on an English exam?\n\nWhat is discouraged is when people make observations about other peoples language use in a disparaging manner, such as insinuating that people use specific constructions because they are ignorant or lazy, or that one way of using language is correct. It can be particularly tiresome when the complaints are based on rules that arent even true."

You could say whitesplaining or straightsplaining, or any number of words. Those are just two examples off the top of my head. Richsplaining would be easy to use and be understood.
