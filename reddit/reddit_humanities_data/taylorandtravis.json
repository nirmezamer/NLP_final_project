            "Oh my goodness, GOOD. I was on Facebook this morning and so many comments under any post about Taylor and/or Travis were so hateful and untrue. And from fully grown adults!! Honestly, people really show their true colors when they\u2019re incapable of empathy and kindness toward people they don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019d like this and for the main Taylor sub to be a safe space to be happy about music and LOVE.",
            "Yeah, I didn't know what a snark sub was at first and got linked to a post there. It was so outrageous that I just commented something nice/defending Travis in it and it got deleted because it said \"No fan behavior\" \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23.\n\nYou know something is extremely toxic if they don't allow any positive/nice comments. I can't even imagine how miserable those ppl have to be. \ud83d\ude29",

            "I am amazed that anyone would create a subreddit to hate on a celebrity. Why do they think anyone cares that they hate a celebrity? And why would anyone participate in something so stupid and useless??  It's so bizarre. Wouldn't it be easier to just ignore that celebrity? What am I missing here?",
