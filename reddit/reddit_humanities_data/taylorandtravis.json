            "Good move OP! And kudos for including KN snark on there too \u2014 we can support T&T\u2019s relationship without belittling his ex. Dredging up his past relationship, and attacking Kayla has never sat right with me. The less said about the TK snark page, the better.",
            "The Travis snark page is by far the worst one I\u2019ve ever seen and that says a lot.  I commented once and was immediately banned for being \u201ctoo positive\u201d and was told I didn\u2019t belong.  \n\nJust two days ago I saw some of their members literally accusing Travis of being a sex addict and abuser.  I messaged the mods saying those type of accusations go way beyond snark and they are opening up themselves for a lawsuit.  (I know it\u2019s very hard to prove but still) They wrote back \u201cwe don\u2019t care. Cry about it.\u201d  \n\nUnbelievable. That sub is vicious, posts blatant lies and goes way beyond snark.  They are also talking about this ban today, saying we must be worried about T&T.  I can\u2019t respond because I\u2019m banned.  Make it make sense!",
            "Oh my goodness, GOOD. I was on Facebook this morning and so many comments under any post about Taylor and/or Travis were so hateful and untrue. And from fully grown adults!! Honestly, people really show their true colors when they\u2019re incapable of empathy and kindness toward people they don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019d like this and for the main Taylor sub to be a safe space to be happy about music and LOVE.",
            "Yeah, I didn't know what a snark sub was at first and got linked to a post there. It was so outrageous that I just commented something nice/defending Travis in it and it got deleted because it said \"No fan behavior\" \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23.\n\nYou know something is extremely toxic if they don't allow any positive/nice comments. I can't even imagine how miserable those ppl have to be. \ud83d\ude29",
