        "content": "I had built this retaining wall on a job i am I a site contractor on,  Then the client says he just bought a brand new 20\u2019 shipping container he wants to bury in the hill. So I took the end of my wall apart, dug it out, set the container on a 1 1/2 inch stone base about 6\u201d. Ran conduits from the house behind the blocks and into the container. Drainage underneath connects to the wall drains. 2\u201d foam insulation all around and 6 mil poly plastic over the top and over hanging the edges, and just a couple inches of mulch over the top. Water proofed it best I could but Skeptical about how long it will last. All in all I\u2019m pretty happy with how it finished and happy with how the doors flush mounted in the wall",
