It costed us around 50k in rather HCOL area. Our experience was:\n\n- We wanted natural stone - too expensive to haul and assemble. Wall blocks are cheaper and easier to work with all around. Went with a Nicolock brand, probably the cheapest of all. It looks good. Not luxe, but good. \n- we wanted higher than 4 ft. But higher means more expensive. It needs a different permit and drawn schematics by engineer. Involving engineer raises the cost, there\u2019s drainage that needs to be done in a certain way - lots of headache. \n- used a hardscape company that done a lot of similar projects (we were looking specially for someone who\u2019s not only doing pavers/masonry). They were done with our project in 2 weeks. Crew of 5 with machinery.",
