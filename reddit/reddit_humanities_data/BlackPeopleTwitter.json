            "My daughter got all A\u2019s and AB\u2019s for the school year so I told her I would get her something. She wants some jewelry. She\u2019s become a little bit more responsible (she\u2019s 12), so I said ok cool let\u2019s go get you a necklace. We get to the jewelry place last weekend and she proceeds to pick out the loudest thing she could find. I told her that getting something smaller would t cause so much attention. She walks off and proceeds to get on her phone\u2026I keep looking and she comes back with a picture of a African king with all gold and says \u201cWell if it was good for him why can\u2019t I do it?\u201d Don\u2019t have kids people.",
            "Not gonna lie gang, got my dream job, my best friend and I, always had feelings for each other and was both single at the same time and finally are together, took her to DR randomly for our birthday (we have the same birthday), and just been loving life. I know the 2nd half of this year about to be wild but damn am I content right now. Life is good. Wanna give this woman a Tiffany and goddamn, I might marry this girl.",
            "My body dysmorphia has been whooping my ass recently. I\u2019ve been in therapy consistently for more than two years but it doesn\u2019t seem to help. I\u2019ve been feeling so exhausted lately from the breakdowns and flare ups. I don\u2019t want to hate my body anymore but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nIt is such a lonely feeling to experience something like this, especially as a black man, because people don\u2019t know what to do with it when I tell them. I don\u2019t know how to overcome this.",
            "I\u2019m about to turn 24 and I\u2019m still figuring out what to do as a career. Rn im trying to go back to school to become a medical lab tech, but im scared that im making the wrong choice. Idk man this shit weights on you a lot. I wish i knew what i wanted to do",
            "I\u2019m in the process of relocating to another city. I am utterly pissed off about how much junk I have acquired in the last three years. Because why do I need two crockpots and  two George Foreman grills? What goes on in my head when I\u2019m buying stuff",
            "I finally started Snowfall last month. Just finished season 6 on Thursday. Man, when I tell you that finale had me fucked up lol. Was close to tears at multiple points. Finally broke down at the last scene. Just amazing television. Now I gotta find something to fill the void...",
            "I\u2019m about to drop my 4th song, it\u2019ll be my 2nd with a semi big artist.  I\u2019m not quite where I wanna be publicity wise but I\u2019m happy to have the opportunities I have this early in my \u201ccareer\u201c",
            "A couple months ago, I commented on here that Greta was that girl and some dude called me autistic and threatened me. I was thinking about it today like was it ever that serious?",
            "I\u2019ve been watching Castlevania lately and I hate Hector so much. I can\u2019t recall the last time I seen a character go out that many times. and when you compare his character to somebody like Isaac, they are on two different planets when it comes to characterization. I love most of the characters, but for some reason, I look at Hector and I just shake my head in shame.",
            "Drop some good watches/shows right now that you\u2019re watching im currently watching the boys! And stax records documentary and clipped (about what happened to the clippers during Donald sterling\u2019s controversy) just finished bridgerton(show outside my usual stuff but if you a lover boy like me you will enjoy) I\u2019m waiting on the bear which comes out end of month!

            "That dap was way too clean, he didn't even pull back after the first connect, white people often do that. He kept a solid lock and slid right into frame with the next few motions, his hand didn't seem like the moves were unfamiliar. I gotta say, for daps from a President other than Obama and maybe Bill, this was impressive."

            "It's not a question of who is better. It's a question of whether Trump is more likely to lose to Biden or someone else. It's a lso a question of the viability of our politics and institutions when these are the options they present us. Serious, fundamental change is needed and if we don't see that now then we are in serious trouble.",

            "Joe's more fired up and well spoken at his rally today. He just needs to get out there in town halls and at the next debate with the same energy. He got plenty of chances to make up being so meek last night. Plus he's lucky most viewers considered last night a draw between two old grumpy men. \n\nTake some cough drops, a bottle of DayQuil and a can of Venors next time Joe! Lol",
