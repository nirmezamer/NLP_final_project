            "We about to head back to war, boys and girls.",
            "I literally cheered when they completely skipped the boat ride lmao",
            "Is it just me, or has the art in the past two chapters been way better than before? 365-374 looked decent, but characters would sometimes look a bit wonky and everything also just looked very grey. 375 and 376 look really good in my opinion, and honestly don\u2019t look much worse than Miura\u2019s art (obviously Miura\u2019s was better, but it almost certainly never will be as good as his). If Studio Gaga can keep up with this quality, I\u2019ll be very happy.",
            "Finally the new chapter has come! While it's a short chapter, the pace is fast, they skip another boat arc, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I hope it doesn't take another 6 months for the next chapter to release. Young Animals really need to fix their schedule, because Studio Gaga was already finished this chapter months ago.",
            "The pacing is pretty good for such a short chapter, alot has been answered and more questions have arisen in the same breath. Excited for the new chapter whenever that drops.",
            "Congratulations to studio Gaga and Mori, i love how they are able to capture the essence of Berserk.\n\nAltough a short chapter im glad the story is moving with a good pace, i wonder how they plan to wage war\u2026",
            "I don't see how the Kushans could possibly fight Griffith. We in trouble.",
            "This reminds me of the Battle of Minas Tirith. Under normal circumstances, there will be no victory... In the end, I hope, win or lose, Guts takes one or more steps forward. I don't want to see another one-sided war with that fucking Griffith smirk!",
            "This chapter, while many definitely foresaw the story heading to this point, did more to move the story of Berserk than the past 2 years. Well done studio Gaga and Mori",
            "I guess for now the story progresses in an expected manner for the foreseeable future."
