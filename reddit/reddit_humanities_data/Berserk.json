            "We about to head back to war, boys and girls.",
            "I literally cheered when they completely skipped the boat ride lmao",
            "Is it just me, or has the art in the past two chapters been way better than before? 365-374 looked decent, but characters would sometimes look a bit wonky and everything also just looked very grey. 375 and 376 look really good in my opinion, and honestly don\u2019t look much worse than Miura\u2019s art (obviously Miura\u2019s was better, but it almost certainly never will be as good as his). If Studio Gaga can keep up with this quality, I\u2019ll be very happy.",
            "RIP to all the strugglers who didn't make it to see this moment. \n\nIt really feels like we're approaching the end game and the team is doing an absolutely fantastic job! The art is absolutely fantastic and it seems like the team has really come into their own style while maintaining Miura's. Not only that but we skipped the boat ride!\n\nI'm really curious to see how this war progresses. It's a bit curious to me that the Kushan have Guts chained up for now when the rest of the crew is being recruited to fight. I get their logic but I can't wait to see Guts and the Kushans bring the fight to Griffith.",
            "Finally the new chapter has come! While it's a short chapter, the pace is fast, they skip another boat arc, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I hope it doesn't take another 6 months for the next chapter to release. Young Animals really need to fix their schedule, because Studio Gaga was already finished this chapter months ago.",
            "The pacing is pretty good for such a short chapter, alot has been answered and more questions have arisen in the same breath. Excited for the new chapter whenever that drops.",
            "Congratulations to studio Gaga and Mori, i love how they are able to capture the essence of Berserk.\n\nAltough a short chapter im glad the story is moving with a good pace, i wonder how they plan to wage war\u2026",
            "I don't see how the Kushans could possibly fight Griffith. We in trouble.",
            "This reminds me of the Battle of Minas Tirith. Under normal circumstances, there will be no victory... In the end, I hope, win or lose, Guts takes one or more steps forward. I don't want to see another one-sided war with that fucking Griffith smirk!",
            "This chapter, while many definitely foresaw the story heading to this point, did more to move the story of Berserk than the past 2 years. Well done studio Gaga and Mori"

            "I think its mainly making fun of people that take berserk way too seriously. Like people forgot trolls and jokes exist.",
            "I can assure you, the people who said \"Griffith did nothing wrong\" have their mothers whose name is \"nothing wrong\".",
            "Cause you will be hard pressed to find more trollable audience. And the fact that most people on this sub give off an impression that they never even read Berserk and mouthbreathing on Griffith solely basing on TicToc shorts and reddit relationships subs' passages about bad boyfriends also doesn't help.",
            "He\u2019s Trolly-Probleming the world to a better place, one mass sacrifice at a time",
            "Griffith though like this \"A hundred men die for my dream, what the difference when I directly kill a hundred more for my dream\".\n\n \"They already slave to my dream, I assume they willing to die for my dream\".",
            "Yeah the hell is empty, all those people are here",
            "Becuase poeple think he is hot",
            "They\u2019re just trolling cuz they\u2019re bored. Yall taking them serious is exactly why they do it.",
            "He\u2019s just a dude building an empire upon a mountain of war crimes. Not too different from any kingdom in history tbh",
            "I don't think there's anyone who thinks Griffith did nothing wrong in a genuine fashion unless they're a genuine sociopath or psychopath that truly lacks empathy. It's a meme used to bait people who feel passionate about the series or as a joke because of how untrue it is.\n\nNow, there are some people who do believe \"Griffith did what a lot of people would do in that situation\" and may be using \"nothing wrong\" as a short hand/poor articulation.\n\nI do think there is something to be said about everything that led Griffith to that point and how many people in that same position would actually do anything differently than him.\n\nWhile I'm sure everyone likes to believe they'd reject the offer to sacrifice, I know I'm certain I wouldn't do it to my loved ones. How certain I'd be after being tortured for a year by that little gremlin shit after losing all ambition and ability to exist free and on my own, and relying on a person I see as a betrayer to me to continue the meager existence that is my new life of agony? \n\nI don't know what would be going through my mind then. I sure hope I'm better than griffirh. (Note I'm not saying Griffiths feelings are correct, just outlining what they are. They're wretched because Griffith is a bad person.) \n\nMany people don't think straight after an upsetting week, let alone a full year of agony. Now have that person who has lost everything but the ability to painfully breathe and require constant aid and care whinwas ne a very successful and talented person, and offer him not just a full restoration of his health and being, but also the closest thing to Godhood he can imagine? All while being manipulated and gaslit by fellow \"gods\" to join them at his lowest and weakest state.\n\nThe truth to it all is that Griffith did everything wrong, but there's a lot of wrong people in the world who would do the same thing, especially after going through what Griffith did."
