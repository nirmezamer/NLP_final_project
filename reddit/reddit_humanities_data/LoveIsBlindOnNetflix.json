            "This season's premise is what the fandom has been asking for years (older cast, experienced, actually mature enough to get married)",
            "I always enjoy the style and body freedom of Brazilian women.   Also, I find Patricks hat wearing to conceal the balding incredibly annoying and distracting.  I cant stand him.",
            "Where are discussions for EP 5+?",
            "They all have a glass wine at hand at all times...",
            "Then men whove been out of a relationship for like a few weeks/months are a MASSIVE red flag",
            "Omg Patrik looks like he could be Marilias son",
            "Ariela is honestly a nut. Her showing up to Renata and Alexandres place is crazy. What was the purpose?",
            "Ariela is way too insecure but Evandro going 11 years to even make contact with a child he has and didnt even disclose him to her initially is insanity.",
            "Dudddeeee Ariela started off trying to defend herself from being called a liar but she shouldve shrugged it off and just let it go. Renata and Ale and Patrik and Marlia have already resolved this discussion and she keeps bringing it up to try and justify her actions. let it gooooo! and then she blew up on Evandro on a totally different topic. She has so many unresolved issues \n\nShes throwing all of her insecurities into other people and fighting with everyone because of the issues in her relationship. I really thought Evandro was showing her so much patience but she cant get out of her victim mentality.",
            "I think this season of LiB Brazil is perfect in the balance of drama and the wholesome aspects "
