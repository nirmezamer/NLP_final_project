Not only she has an increadible healthy outlook on relationships , but she is cute , funny and open. Watching her going through the experience has been inspiring.\n\nHer maturity when dealing with delicate situations and her openness and vulnerability  to welcome love is heartwarming. I also think she is clever, funny and entertaining to watch, cause unfortunately healthier constants have been usually a little boring to watch (Sorry Amy and Jonny). I\u2019m really enjoying all the segments with her and Leonardo (who is also a sweetheart). It just shows that healthier dynamics can be fun to watch and to follow. Makes me wonder if reality tv can be fun even without the Arielas /Chelsea/Shayne of this world ?\n",

            "I like her a lot too. BUT I can't help but think if the genders were reversed, people might find her problematic. If it was a man that had multiple hook up buddies before coming on love is blind and his phone blows up with messages like \"I miss you. Where have you been\" and the first time his fiance goes to his apartment she finds sex dice and blind folds just sitting around...I feel like people would be warning his fiance to be cautious. I don't think she's done anything wrong and I like that she's transparent about who she is. I just think a double standard is showing here."
