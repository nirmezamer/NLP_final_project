But yeah, gaining 150k stardust is a win for me.",

We would run into each other at gyms, always end up raiding with one another and added one another after our first raid!\nIt's became a daily thing, and we never did manage to meet or even say hi to one another, although we must have been step apart! (Make it a habit not approach people, especially women playing Pokemon go unless someone approaches me first, so this was bound to happen haha.)\nHowever, I had to return home and we've been making an effort to send each other new and unique gifts everyday.\nIt's fun to say the least and an awesome experience.\nAnd they keep gifting me raid passes!\nToo bad they're not on Campfire so I can say a million thank yous, however, I use my buddy Pokemon to say TY and they do as well, so it's great.\nThis community is amazing when it comes together.\nI hope you all are having an amazing summer because I really needed this right now and it's great.
