            "Just redownloaded after over a year and I\u2019m level 32 with 3 pokemon over 3k and the rest between 2700-2000. What should I do/prioritize to get better and better pokemon? Don\u2019t really have anyone in person to play with and can\u2019t solo any good raids",
            "Do you go out of your way to do a raid every day or do you get rid of healing items?\nI do the team rocket battles every day but I don't raid more than like twice a week.\nIt seems like my backpack is filled with healing items but I have a tough time letting go of them.\u00a0 Do you all have a use for all those healing items or do you just toss them?",
            "Is it just me or was there an option to sort stickers by quantity for like a couple weeks and then they got rid of it? I thought losing that option was due to me getting a new phone but now it\u2019s been months and I still can\u2019t sort stickers by quantity so did they just get rid of it for everyone?",

I hold my tasks, but I get enough EXP to level up (after I complete all tasks), what happens to the extra EXP? does it counts for next level or is it lost?",

            "So, how important are the stars? Having more stars is better, but I read once that their effect is not that substantial. Just debating whether I should keep up my practice of chucking everything that doesn't have 3 stars, since I'm still in the process of getting adjusted back into the game."
