            "I recently got a new (used) acoustic guitar for 1,000 (thanks to a generous family members loan). The Furch Green OM-SR goes for about 2,200 new. Its just got some nicks n dings. Im really happy about it. Surprised how quickly I adapted to the 1 3/4 nut after playing thick 1 5/8 vintage tele necks for so long - the soft V shape helps. \n\nI dont have a question. I just wanted to share my joy somewhere and Ive been banned from r/guitar for years due to r/guitarcirclejerk membership.",
            "Anybody run the Life Pedal with Strymon Iridium? I love the sound of the Life Pedal from demos but i dont have a huge amp. Is it a waste to use it with an amp sim like the Iridium?",
            "Is it possible to achieve feedback using a multi fx pedal with a feedbacker pedal? i currently have a NUX MG-30 as my multi fx and am planning to buy the Boss FB-2 as a booster and also feedbacker, will it work if i'm just practicing at home with headphones as my output or do i need to turn the speakers on to achieve feedback",
            "I used someone's Zoom G5n and immediately enjoyed it, I'm planning to buy myself one, but is it really worth it or should I just aim for Zoom G3xn cuz I feel like it's the same, just without a 4th pedal?",
            "how can i identify the date of my crybaby based on the serial number? is there a lookup somewhere?",
            "Can I use a ToneX One with a tube amp or will it blow up? (Will it sound good) \nAlso, can it be used to model delays or are they purely amp/cab sims?",
            "Looking for the cheapest and smallest flanger.\nAfter almost buying the mooer (~50$) i saw many at half price (AKLOT, ISET, and many more)\nAre they any good or might aswell buy the mooer?",
            "Looking for a fuzz to stack on top of my main drive sound (Oneder Drive + SD-1) for fuzzed out splatty lead lines/solos.  \n\nI started using my Behringer Super Fuzz in that context and I love how it sounds for lower notes but anything above the 12th fret leans too hard on that octave-ish sound. Any recommendations for something that'll get me there?",
            "I just had a pedal given to me by a friend, and I cannot find ANYTHING online about it. Its a tiny boost pedal called a little more by Nth Degree Tonesmiths. Its the roughly the size of pollytune mine, good color, and has 4 screw hole flanges. Its a super cool little pedal that adds a nice creamy warm tone to my rig. Would love to know more about it! Thanks!",

            "Thanks for sharing that description! Interesting way to do it, as I am trying to figure out how to integrate my board in the most flexible way. How do you like the SY-200? I am thinking about getting one. What is your favorite sound out of it?",
            "I ordered a similar AB/Y pedal with some blending ability, excited to crossbreed my drives and end up with a tone that sounds like it has a birth defect",
            "Yeah it is pretty sweet.",
            "I love the pad and string sounds. Running it now parallel alongside my normal signal it is way more useful for me now. Im a guitar player and Ill play a certain way so having the synth previous dominate my sound when on, I just couldnt adapt to it. Now it kinda sits in the back and adds something.",
            "Oh and the sy 200 is great. I love that I can now have fuzz and synth sounds run parallel with each other and it sounds amazing",
            "Ive had in my arsenal a few synth pedals and always wanted to run it in parallel to my normal chain.\n\nUsing the jhs summing amp Ive been able to achieve this and how I did it is as follows:\n\nGtr > EQD Swiss things (gain pedals in loop 1 and modulation in loop 2) - output 1 into a Marshall and output 2 into a fender.\n\nUsing the tuner out of the eqd swiss things I send a signal to a boss tu3w which then goes into the 3 synth pedals and boss slicer this then goes into 1/2 input of the summing amp.\n\nOutput 2 that goes into the fender amp I have, I actually send it to the boss loop station (which I basically use as a splitter) output 1 goes into the fender amp and output 2 into a korg tr-s (which I use as a way to add tube character to a orange super crush) this then goes into the 2/2 input of the summing amp.\n\nThe output of the summing amp then goes into an orange super crush.\n\nThis set up works really well and Im able to blend in a synth signal into my normal setup."

It sounds how it looks pretty much. I cant imagine much better for what Im playing right now.\n\nEverything is very specific and thought out. But I will say I have a LOT more to dig into the Collider. Everything else is pretty straight forward. But having the Collider last allows midi, and preset changes on the fly Im trying to work into my sets."
