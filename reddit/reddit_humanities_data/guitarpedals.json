            "I recently got a new (used) acoustic guitar for \u20ac1,000 (thanks to a generous family member\u2019s loan). The Furch Green OM-SR goes for about \u20ac2,200 new. It\u2019s just got some nicks n dings. I\u2019m really happy about it. Surprised how quickly I adapted to the 1 3/4\u201d nut after playing thick 1 5/8\u201d vintage tele necks for so long - the soft V shape helps. \n\nI don\u2019t have a question. I just wanted to share my joy somewhere and I\u2019ve been banned from r/guitar for years due to r/guitarcirclejerk membership.",
            "Looking for a plate or multi reverb but specifically it has to sound good IN FRONT as my amp doesn't have an FX loop. \n\nClean player primarily but also want something that'll fit an AC30 crunch and top boost sound. I don't do anything fancy with modulation hence my preference for plate (or room I gjess) \n\nI'm aware of the Catalina Talisman. I haven't found any reviews for the UA golden that aren't in a loop. Ventris, neunaber are other options I'm aware of. Also red panda context but I just heard about it for the first time. \n\nOh, ans there's a chance I'll run this with a very clean slap back delay if that makes a difference.",
            "Anybody run the Life Pedal with Strymon Iridium? I love the sound of the Life Pedal from demos but i dont have a huge amp. Is it a waste to use it with an amp sim like the Iridium?",
            "I have an MXR M237 DC Brick, which came with its own cables. I have about 6x pedals & a little JOYO amp sim, with the total mA for all seven, being about \\[250mA\\].\n\nThe M237 DC Brick manual states \" Eight 9V outputs can handle an average of **150 mA each**, or a total of **1,200 mA in any configuration**\".\n\nI'm considering picking up a UAFX Orion Tape Delay pedal, whose manual states \"**9VDC, center-negative, 250 mA minimum**\"\n\nSo my question is, does this mean the Orion's 250mA minimum would cause issues with my MXR M237 DC brick, that states each output can handle an average of 150mA each?\n\nI mean, I still have like 900+mA to spare, so would the MXR brick just use what's left to power the Orion, or does that mean the DC brick can't handle more than about 150mA on each outlet, no matter what the total mA is for everything connected?",

            "Is it possible to achieve feedback using a multi fx pedal with a feedbacker pedal? i currently have a NUX MG-30 as my multi fx and am planning to buy the Boss FB-2 as a booster and also feedbacker, will it work if i'm just practicing at home with headphones as my output or do i need to turn the speakers on to achieve feedback",
            "Hello!  \nI've got a couple of questions:\n\n1)I'm looking for a good tuner that can lock in quickly to the note. So I can also use it to practice string bends. Does this even make sense?   \nI am a bedroom player and don't need a 150\u20ac$ pedal  \n2) Any recommendations on where I should add a phaser? Before or after OD (SD-1)?  \n3) Recommendations for a rat-like pedal?   \n4) Any optical wah recommendations?\n\nFor context, I play mostly heavy metal and hard rock. Got EVH 5153 El34, Orange Jim Root terror and Marshall DSL20H.",
            "Good afternoon, noon, noon. On the subject of echos... I have a reallllly old Line 6 Echo Park pedal which  I haven't used it in a long time because the snooty side of me binned it off for something fancier.\n\nHowever something led me to pull it out this afternoon (the pedal that is) and whilst it powers up I can't manage to get any signal to pass through it, both with the pedal on or bypassed. Any smarter folk on here knowing what piece of its insides may be causing me issues or is it just no use to anyone anymore?\n\nThanks in advance!",
            "Hey, I was wondering if anyone has used the EHX Bass Clone for guitar and compared it with the Small/Neo Clone? I've read it's the same circuit as the Small Clone but with added Bass/Treble/Depth knobs and that is very appealing to me, however there are only 2 videos of it being used for guitar:\n\n[https://youtu.be/mLBhTxdzw1k?si=GHQ30uB3H3\\_aQdut&t=468](https://youtu.be/mLBhTxdzw1k?si=GHQ30uB3H3_aQdut&t=468)\n\n[https://youtu.be/ezQxrv02o7U?si=QMD6LQ2eNMHQel\\_I&t=149](https://youtu.be/ezQxrv02o7U?si=QMD6LQ2eNMHQel_I&t=149)\n\nIt sounds great in the first video but it's very thin sounding in the second one, might be due to it being last in the chain, some tone suck happening from the previous pedals?\n\nI'm concerned I might buy it and it ends up sounding like the second video rather than the first. I can't return it either since the only store selling it here has a no return policy.\n\nThanks.",
            "I like that funky sound from an octaver paired with a phaser...\n\n  \nWhich goes first?"

            "Behringer uc200 chorus. At that price it just straight up shouldn't sound as good as it does. I'm always worried something's going to go wrong with it being in a plastic case (not the whole \"oh it's gonna snap when I step on it, my problem is that sometimes the footswitch feels like it's gonna break) but honestly I can look past that and it sounds awesome",

            "Dunno if I'd say guilty pleasure, more taboo (at least to those who find vaginas nothing to joke about!) but the Pussy Melter pedal is one of the best mid gain drives I own. I've probably recorded more in the last year using the Foxcatcher + Pussy Melter combo than any other combo.\n\nStill cracks me up that it caused such a stir and was even banned from Reverb.com. Big Muff, Swollen Pickle and countless others are controversy-free yet this one somehow cut too deep for some folks.. America still hasn't shaken its puritanical outlook on sex, especially vaginas. We're totally cool with violence, even in cartoons and comics for kids, but talk of lady parts or a split second of Janet Jackson's nipple and suddenly essays and think pieces about ethics and trauma come flooding in.\n\nAside from sounding amazing, the enclosure is the most insanely vivid pink color I've ever seen. After just 5 or so seconds of looking at it, anything else you look at is dark/shadowy and takes your eyes a bit to readjust again. The paint job is incredible. The overall look reminds me of the Pussy Wagon from Kill Bill meets caricaturized 80s hair metal parody. Novelty factor is there but it's also a truly excellent sounding pedal. I know nothing about circuits so no idea what its derivative of or if its original but it's easily one of the best mid gain drives I've played, for sure."
