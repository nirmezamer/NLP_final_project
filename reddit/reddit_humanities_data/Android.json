            "I thought the Oppo Pad 3 would be announced first and then sometime later a OnePlus Pad based on it. Hoping it targets the same price point as the OnePlus Pad/Oppo Pad 2. Snapdragon Gen 3 but I would have been happy with a Dimensity 9200 or 9300 if that could keep it sub $500",
            "Hope this comes with OpenCanvas out of the box \ud83e\udd1e\n\nI really want Open Canvas in a device without an AMOLED/foldable screen (for durability purposes)",
            "Yeah,\n\nbuying from 1+ given their horrendous customer service reputation is a risky move.",
            "I wish Samsung would make a keyboard like this.",
            "All Android tablets are useless until we get a real notes app. Right now our options are Samsung notes and OneNote. Samsung notes is exclusive to Samsung devices meaning you can't sync your notes with your computer. OneNote takes up 20% of the screen with an unhideable toolbar.\n\nMeanwhile iPad has Goodnotes and now Apple notes. At my college goodnotes are the standard. It has ai capabilities, corrections, ease of use and loads of customizability. Apple has just released the newest version of their notes app and it's supposed to be brilliant. It even has nice gimicks like displaying a shadow of your pen as you bring it close to the screen.\n\nI think this is a Google issue. A notes app is a standard utility. Google has keep but that's nowhere near sufficient.",
            "I guess \n\nNo headphone jack \n\nNo SD card slot?",
            "Snapdragon will be better for custom rom though, once the tablet is EOL for OS and security updates.",
            "This is what I was wanting as well. I really liked the software experience on the one plus foldable just the hardware was not for me when it came to the smaller exterior screen. That software with the open canvas on the tablet with a snapdragon gen 3 would be nice",
            "Not sponsored or anything but I've been pleasantly surprised with Notewise on my Tab S9+. It's very stable and works well compared to the mess that is Goodnotes on Android. Latency is still noticeably higher than Samsung Notes but the extra features make up for it.",
            "This thought process is why companies get away with locking down the OS and pushing developers out. Android doesn't need native, supercool, creative notes apps, just go download a third party app. Just give the developer great support and access to APIs so they can continue to deliver features they think consumers want."

            "Pleaaaaase, do something about Screen Share Permission during EVERY screen mirror session. If I had to touch my phone to Allow screen mirroring, I might as well just use my phone.",
            "Oh wow thats pretty handy. Still waiting for pixel to get the integrated features like the screen mirroring and files.",
            "This is pretty cool. But really all I want are messaging improvements. RCS support if my messaging app on my phone supports it would be good. Also I'm sick of it showing SMS messages (and notifications) for messages that my phone filters as spam.",
            "they should finish migrating features from control panel to settings after 10 years maybe",
            "Too bad I can't use it because MS won't let me move the task bar to the top of the screen. I have to use startallback and it removes the W11 start menu\u00a0",
            "This was fixed for me recently, idk if it was an update or if I repaired my phone. But not it only asks you once and your just need to have unlock your phone, no more permission.",
            "Please add screen mirroring to anything besides Galaxy devices",

            "This seems like such a weird gimmick.\n\nI don't care how many speakers you put on there, there isn't physically enough space to make them sound anything other than tinny. \n\nEven if some of them are essentially subwoofers, there's no way this sounds anywhere near decent enough for people that care about it.",
