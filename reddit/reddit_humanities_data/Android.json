            "Would be a huge win for both. MediaTek is like AMD (in the laptop space), making completive or superior SoC and non-nerd people hardly know them, and consumers don't associate their name with top performance. For Samsung tho they'll have to spend some time marketing/convincing people of this new brand. I can see a lot of \"tech\" people of Twitter / Threads freaked out thinking it's some mid range chip.",

MediaTek have been pushing or a while and it's a good reminder to Qualcomm not to overstep here. Samsung name attached brings a lot of perceived value. Most people will not even notice the small changes in performance. It's just the next s series phone.",

            "I love the boxy and flat shape of my S24U, it honestly makes it feel so much better and is far more usable without having to hold the phone weird or just have issues seeing content on the edges of the screen. Trying to take notes was impossible when you get near the edge of the screen on older phones (Note 10+ in my case).",

            "Yeah, I was hoping for it to be largely the same as the Reno 12 Pro in the domestic Chinese market but the downgrades in a few areas were a real let down. As far as Chinese camera-centric midrangers in Europe go, these are far less attractive than the Honor 200 series that just came out, too. Cheaper, sure, but with the current offers, the Honor 200 Pro can be had for only 60 more than the Reno 12 Pro in the UK.",

Maybe not as good as the competition but said competition costs basically the same (Realme 12 Pro+, Redmi Note 13 Pro+. HMD Skyline is coming out in July and probably will be in the price point of the Reno12 Pro, etc.)\n\n  \nMeanwhile the Reno12 FS is a horrible deal and nobody should buy it because the Reno11 F is cheaper and better (except for less memory)\n\nThey had the guts to price that one just barely below the Samsung Galaxy A55's current price (1699z vs 1799z) and even the Reno12 costs the same until July 2nd. What the hell??",
