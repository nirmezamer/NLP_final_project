            "$36 for breakfast at the hotel, it was continental so not really that great tasting and the kids mostly wasted food. $35 for parking at Sesame Street place, we brought food in so I only spent $20 on dippin dots before we left, since it was mid 90s. The hotel bar upped their prices on beer from Wednesday to Thursday, a $2 increase in the same beer which I thought was a little strange, same time I was drinking too, just a different bartender. Wawa for breakfast today before we head into Philly for some kid museum, we found an Irish restaurant that looked good but zero parking so instead we plan on a Mexican place closer to the hotel.",

Another OP said to me \"reprioritize your time management and do everyone a favor\" in a post where they were essentially asking everyone to outsource their time and effort into spoon feeding them a complete mk18 clone parts list, so that they wouldn't have to waste their own valuable time doing so. Irony is dead.\n\nIn other news, it hit 92 with all of the humidity here in southwest PA while the contractors were digging post footings for the carport. Fellas were slamming beer when I came out to check on them. They got it done, though.",

            "Should be getting my Steiner T432 in tomorrow, my trigger kit for the B&T TP9 in next week along with some new batteries for the 509T X2 on the same gun. Batteries lasted over a year so I can't complain at all on a high setting with the circle dot reticle.\n\nI'm also going to give the Heathen Systems Assaulter Bipod a go as I'd like a simple bipod that I can keep on the rifle at all times, and the whole thing weighs 3.5 ounces with a barricade stop built into it. Not expecting it to be anything but light and adequate.",
            "I have a neighbor with a Glock 17 Gen 1, a couple years ago he was talking about possibly getting a Gen 5 and I offered to trade him but he turned me down. Oh well.\n\nBought a Condor shirt, one of those t-shirts with velcro patches. Gonna try wearing it at work to see if it's more comfortable in this heat. Nice thing is that now I'm buying t-shirts sized L instead of XL like I used to. My only problem is that sometimes shirts sized L vary in sizes, and so the shoulder width doesn't always match me. But buying XL sized shirts doesn't feel good either because they're meant to accomodate a way bigger gut than I have.\n\nApparently our boss got in a shouting match with someone from corporate arguing over how he should be running the branch, and this was perfectly timed to coincide with him getting a call that one of our crews locked themselves out of their truck at a stop over an hour away. Our boss was fuming for that day.",
