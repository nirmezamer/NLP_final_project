        "content": "I\u2019ve never fallen for any of the number of phone scams but today I almost did. I was called by a person with a British Aus accent claimed to be from my bank and who knew my full name and said that there had been some charges from Singapore. The phone number was a landline from Melbourne so I thought it seemed semi legit but I was still wary. He gave a number to call back on which had all the voice recordings of my actual bank and even the buttons to press to gain access to the crime branch. This was a big mistake as I should have just called my banks number. \n\nA guy with a sophisticated Aussie accent explained that there were a few steps I\u2019ll need to take to strengthen my account. They sent me a code on my bank\u2019s actual SMS. So i had previous legitimate messages from my bank on the same number. This is what blows my mind, they were able to access the banks sms. That\u2019s when I started to think this possibly could be legitimate but I was still asking lots of questions and not willingly divulging information. Basically they wanted me to take all my money and then send it to a new account they were setting up for me and they sent the new account details on the banks sms. \n\nI told them I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing this and I was a few minutes away from my bank so I\u2019ll just walk down. This is when he started getting really intense and desperate and saying the fraudsters were very close to moving my money out of my account. I asked them to send me a message though my banks app and they couldn\u2019t do it. I looked up the bsb and it was ANZ and I said, why would my new account be ANZ? It didn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI put them on hold and called the legit bank number and asked them to check if there were any cases of fraud in my account. I explained the phone call and they said it was a very sophisticated phishing scam where they have your details, can get into smses and are using AI to fake the Aussie accent. Although I\u2019m vigilant, I feel there were times where I thought it was a legitimate phone call. In hindsight there were so many red flags but you kind of overlook some of them. Even though I was very cautious, I could have been susceptible. So Just beware. ",

            "Sometimes the SMS is real, they want your 2FA.\n\nThey give an excuse, try to login into your account, but the bank sends an SMS choice to confirm. \n\nThey need that code to finish logging into your account... so they say that they sent you and you need to read to them to confirm it's really you. \n\nBam.\n\nOnce they called me with all my details saying there's a reverse charge that seemed suspicious from Amazon subscription. To cancel i needed to call my bank and gave me the correct number... but they said if i just confirmed it was me via SMS they could do immediately. \n\nI got the SMS which said to not give it to anyone, not even to bank employees... that was almost too late but i was lucky.\n\nAn Australian would probably pick the accent but i am an immigrant and didnt quite notice it. Seemed legit enough to me.\n\nI told them that the number was 1234.... very slowly one by one. They got aggressive and said to me \"fuck you , you are a dog\" in their thick accent... Then i helped them and said \"if you want to pretend to be Australian, at least call me cunt instead... \n\nCalling me a dog is too cute lol",
            "I'm glad you managed to break out of the fog of credulity you were in and stopped yourself. What matters is that you were ultimately smart enough to not lose all your money, although it sounds like it was a close call and you must still be in shock.\n\nThe SMS protocol was never designed to be secure. Someone sending a text can put any number they like in the Sender field of that text, and in your phone it will 100% appear to be from that faked sender. This is called \"spoofing\" and is almost impossible to detect.",
            "I'm not sure why most people here are giving you a hard time - not only did you not fall for it, but you also took the time to describe the call in detail to help others. Thanks for sharing your experience.\n\n I for one will be showing this to my parents and older relatives so they're aware of how sophisticated these scam calls are getting. Appreciate it.",
            "It\u2019s extremely easy to send you a text that\u2019s spoofed as a different number. This is the easy bit. The rest of pretty good",
            "All anyone needs to remember is this: we (I work for a bank in Fraud) do not need you to assist us in stopping access to your account. We do it thousands of times a day.",
            "For anyone reading - \n\n> Basically they wanted me to take all my money and then send it to a new account\n\nThis is not a thing a bank will ever do. This is fraud. If you've got this far stop here immediately and say \"No, you're a fraud, shove that as far up your arse as you can mate. Right up there. Yep. All the way.\"\n\nThere are flags before this, but this is the big one. It seems to be common to quite a few of these sorts of scams, and has been for some years. The key here is that the bank can and will stop any transactions it feels like. You don't need a new account and you \\*never\\* need to move your money for them. The obvious answer to this -\n\n> saying the fraudsters were very close to moving my money out of my account\n\nIs to say \"Well you should stop them then, that's your job, you're the bank\".\n\nI know, they are very convincing and use stress techniques to try to suspend your critical thinking, and well done OP for seeing what they were up to. I know it feels shit that they tried this on you, and that you came close, but you won. Well done :)",

            "That's one reason why I never answer unknown or private numbers. If it's important enough they'll leave a message.",
            "Just don\u2019t answer any calls with an unknown number, even though it looks like a legit AU number. If it were important, a voicemail will be left. Don\u2019t call any number provided to you. You had doubts throughout, go with your gut feeling and walk away. It\u2019s not that much of a sophisticated scam, the only scary thing is that AI is being used to replicate an Australian accent.",
            "The other thing that doesn't make sense about the story is that they apparently knew the fraudsters were about to take your money but they, they bank, could do nothing to prevent that transfer other than move your money elsewhere. They're the bank! They can definitely prevent transfers if they know they're fraudulent."
