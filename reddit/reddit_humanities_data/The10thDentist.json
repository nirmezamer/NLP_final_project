Of course, it\u2019s not a thing that I hold on to for even a few seconds, but I definitely feel a sharp pang of \u201cwtf? A salad?\u201d every single time.\n\nMy thought process essentially is: *why are you ordering an expensive salad in this restaurant when you can just make it yourself at home?*\n\nWhich, obviously, applies to the rest of the food in the restaurant\u2019s menu. I mean, I usually order steak or burger and of course I can make that at home. But for some reason, ordering a salad just seriously annoyed me. \n\nAnd now I think I know why: I think I don\u2019t like salads in general for the same reason I wouldn\u2019t eat an entire plate of plain white rice. I don\u2019t like monotony in my life, and I think salads are just the *most boring* dishes. It\u2019s just vegetables, and vegetables are always the side dish. So you\u2019re eating a plate full of side dish because .. ???\n\nLike, I eat vegetables all the time but the \u201cmain\u201d is always meat or fish.

Honestly they are quite fun if you are a confident child (or adult who am i to judge), and a nightmare for socially awkward person.

I've listened to multiple Twins games that I've had to turn off because they were going so long into extra innings and I've had to leave a couple of games due to how late they were going.  I feel like games rarely go past the 10th anymore and it's honestly kind of exciting to see how your team will respond to the runner on 2nd as the inning starts, especially if the guy on base is an excellent base runner.\n\nThat's all. Not extremely controversial to anyone outside the baseball community, but something I've enjoyed. \n\nGo Twins!",
