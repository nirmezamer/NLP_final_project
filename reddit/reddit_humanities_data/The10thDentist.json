        "content": "(I\u2019ve been ruminating about this for a while because I actually didn\u2019t know *why* it irritated me until recently.)\n\nI\u2019ve always gotten irritated when someone orders a salad in a restaurant \u2014 friends and family but *especially* when I\u2019m on a date. Of course, it\u2019s not a thing that I hold on to for even a few seconds, but I definitely feel a sharp pang of \u201cwtf? A salad?\u201d every single time.\n\nMy thought process essentially is: *why are you ordering an expensive salad in this restaurant when you can just make it yourself at home?*\n\nWhich, obviously, applies to the rest of the food in the restaurant\u2019s menu. I mean, I usually order steak or burger and of course I can make that at home. But for some reason, ordering a salad just seriously annoyed me. \n\nAnd now I think I know why: I think I don\u2019t like salads in general for the same reason I wouldn\u2019t eat an entire plate of plain white rice. I don\u2019t like monotony in my life, and I think salads are just the *most boring* dishes. It\u2019s just vegetables, and vegetables are always the side dish. So you\u2019re eating a plate full of side dish because .. ???\n\nLike, I eat vegetables all the time but the \u201cmain\u201d is always meat or fish. Just last night I had steak and Brussels sprouts for dinner. However, you wouldn\u2019t catch me eating a bowl full of Brussels sprouts for dinner because .. what the fuck?",

            "Salads aren't literally just vegetables? They can be ordered that way sure, but most restaurant salads I have seen usually have a protein of some kind, often croutons, and sometimes fruit as well.",

Back in college I used to get this one that had strawberries, avocado, parmesan crisps, red onion and white balsamic and I would always get chicken or salmon on top. Why is that worse than having a salmon with rice and broccoli? Or are you talking about people who order just a salad and no protein?",

If I order a salad, I enjoy a huge meal and can get sides, drinks, and desserts.\n\nAlso, I do eat just brussel sprouts for dinner? You have a limited view on what makes a meal. I love just roasted veggies for dinner.\u00a0",

Honestly they are quite fun if you are a confident child (or adult who am i to judge), and a nightmare for socially awkward person. In my personal opinion they are one of my more memorable experiences in disneyland cuz the ones i interact with seems really passionate and humorous, but i get it isnt for everyone"

It's **one person** with a SIGNIFICANT advantage! They have two heads, you can't beat that.\n\nThere is no way that either of \"them\" (if you treat them as separate people) can ever have any sort of independence from the other. They are literally joined together forever, and share all meals and organs, and all life experiences.\n\nI think it would also help them assimilate into society. The way we do it now, there are so many uneasy questions and uncomfortable situations. But if it's just like \"Yeah, my names Rebecca, I have two heads\" that's so much easier for everyone involved, especially Rebecca.\n\nEDIT: This post only has a 65% upvote rate, so it's encouraging to hear that 35% of you agree with me.
