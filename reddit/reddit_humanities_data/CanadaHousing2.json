That was 2017 I don\u2019t want to see it now. \n\nIn one class an international student walked in late with no bag, and asked me for a piece of paper. I had a flyer in my bag blank on the back so I offered it. (Thought a student without a computer was odd but these things cost money)\n\nThe student then asked me for a pen. I verbally lol\u2019d and went on with my business. \n\nMy diploma now means nothing because the college is handing them out like hot cakes and gets filtered away by HR macros when I apply to jobs. Well worth my time and money !\n\nBig thanks to the fantastic individuals vetting people applying to studying in Canada \n\nHappy Canada Day! Not really sure what we\u2019re celebrating anymore.",

Another good chunk spoke through a friend since they didn't know English.\n\nThis being said, by the 3rd and 4th semester over 60% of the cohort had failed or switched programs, and the remaining international students were primarily hard working, spoke English well, and wanted to learn to get a good job in computer science.\n\nLooking back I doubt any of the ones that failed out went home, but I blame the system more than them as individuals",
