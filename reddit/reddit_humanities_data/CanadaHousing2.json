            "My god why is anyone appeasing this entitlement. Great on Maxine. We\u2019ve been harassed and scammed over the phones for years, done without conscience. Now they\u2019re here on our soil trying to pull scams.",

            "Well done, Maxime! The entitlement of these guys is beyond imagination!!!",
            "Wow what an asshole. IRCC should NOT be extending permits if you're doing everything other than what you're supposed to be doing here, especially when you're disrupting so many people.\n\nFuck this guy! Cancel the existing permit and throw him out right now. The entitlement is insane, and I was an international student once, temporary and worked my way through the system to become a productive member of the society and a citizen.",
            "The protestors will illegally try to stay or go to US if there is no extensions. The government must make sure theyre in the airport and on the plane to india"

            "It might be unpopular but it's been made such a joke that canadian citizens have been having to live like this because of rampant immigration, that I don't feel a shred of sympathy for these people. Go home. \n\nSocial media has vilified the people living in \"Trudeau towns\" as being violent druggies rather that working class citizens who cant make ends meet because of our situation... why am I expected to feel bad for the international students?",

That would be cool. Do you know where the money ends up though. The rich get it all back. This is a weird world we live in",
