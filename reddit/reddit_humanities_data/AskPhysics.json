I don't know what to do next.\n\nI can do PhD but I feel it is not for me \n\nI did searched for any m.tech program where I am eligible but there is very few and it requires high fees structure\n\nIf I switch to completely different fields like software development. I have to start from scratch. But nowadays market only recruit engineering graduates\n\nSo, i don't know what to do next !! I hoping for some suggestions regarding this.",

Well, kind of like quantum mechanics, but can subatomic particles hop between different times? Going forward in time, staying the same, or going back? Or maybe since the universe is a sheet possibly stacked on top of other universes in different times, could it be possible for the sheets to go through each other? Just saying, I\u2019m 15, in high school, and barely understand physics. Although, I try.",

We are just clusters of matter and energy no different from a spring onion, or a chunk of Halley's comet, or a cloud of gas from a distant nebula. If you know a human can't break a physical law then you also know that any other nondescript matter in the universe can't do it either.",

            "the universe is not a sheet. it is 'like' a sheet in that a shadow is a 2d representation of a 3d object. the time as a dimension is not really as a 4th dimension, other than time can be thought of as dimensional I.e. time can possess geometric properties. thus time-space as the properties of one necessarily affect the other. the universe is NOT a sheet. we can think of it that way to try to conceptualize the multitudes of dimension our perception cannot fully grasp. time appears to us to flow - that appearance is as real as we can hope for. how time behaves outside our perception is impossible to determine currently.",

            "Not quite what youre asking, and Im going to need someone else to elaborate further, but isnt there an extension to the double split experiment where an observation in the future collapses the waveform in the past?",
            "Theres something called a closed timelike curve which was discovered somewhat recently which involves things going backwards and forwards in time. However because its a closed curve, nothing can just enter a ctc without already being in it. Also, because its a loop, nothing can change between each cycle through the curve ie. a person in a ctc cant gain memories and a camera cant record a video because it has to return to the same state at each cycle. (Physicists, correct me if Im wrong on these points, which I may be as I dont know if I properly understand these aspects)",

            "I can't parse your question sorry, but I will say that technically we don't have any proof that going back in time is impossible, it's just an assumption we've made (we have a huge amount of experience of things not going backwards in time yes, but that doesn't make a proof)",

            "Kinda the same reason that sound always travels at the speed of sound regardless of amplitude or frequency(granted there are differences but this should be a simple enough explanation) ie your witnessing energy not matter moving so the only thing that matters is the medium through which it passes, which creates the resistance(dictates the speed)",
            "It's important to note that this is not exclusive to EM waves. Any wave that follows the wave equation within some medium will travel at a constant velocity, regardless of the energy or frequency it carries. \n\nIf this isn't true, we say that the medium is \"dispersive\", that is, waves of different frequencies will travel at different speeds.",

            "Another answer is special relativity: no photon actually has a fixed, unequivocal frequency. If you measure a photon with a certain E and frequency while standing on earth it will of course have a speed of c. If you now get in a spaceship and travel 99.9% of c you will still measure that photon as going away from you at c. HOWEVER, you will measure a higher frequency for the same photon.",

            "To find the energy of particle C in the rest system of particle B, we can use the given method. Lets denote the rest mass energy of particle A as ( m\\_A c\\^2 ) and that of particle B as ( m\\_B c\\^2 ), where ( c ) is the speed of light. The rest mass energies are given as 18 MeV for particle A and 10 MeV for particle B.\n\nThe momentum of particle C in the rest system of particle B can be calculated using the formula:\n\npc=2mBmA2mB2\n\nSubstituting the given values (and remembering that ( c = 1 ) in natural units):\n\npc=210MeV(18MeV)2(10MeV)2\n\npc=20324100MeV\n\npc=20224MeV\n\npc=11.2MeV\n\nSince particle C is massless, its energy in the rest system of particle B is equal to its momentum:\n\nEc=pc=11.2MeV\n\nRounded to the nearest number, the energy of particle C in the rest system of particle B is **11 MeV**.\n\nNow, for the energy of particle C in the rest system of particle A, we need to consider that in the rest system of particle A, particle B will have some kinetic energy due to the conservation of momentum. However, since particle C is massless, its energy will be the same in all reference frames. Therefore, the energy of particle C in the rest system of particle A is also **11 MeV**. This is because the energy of a massless particle is invariant under Lorentz transformations"
