Any photon now emitted from a galaxy beyond ~18B ly away (proper distance) will never *ever* reach earth.  Any light we see in the future was emitted from those galaxies before they crossed that threshold.\n\n> Additionally, will those galaxies reach a point where they appear to disappear or fade out of existence on follow-up images like the Deep Field, as if they just switched off?\n\nYes, but not blink away, but they will redshift into the noise floor of the CMB.  Take a star like Earhendel which is *currently* about 23B ly away.  That\u2019s the proper distance.  It probably supernovae awhile ago, but regardless, any light leaving it now will never reach us.  But there was light emitted a billion years ago when it was still within the cosmic event horizon and that light will reach us in perhaps 100B yrs due to expansion.",

The calculus calculation shouldn't be that hard.\n\nWatching a receding galaxy is seeing the light energy emitted by it show up more spread out like a friend sending you a letter once per day but you start to get them every 1.1 days then 1.5 days then 2 8 15 30 100 10000 days apart.
