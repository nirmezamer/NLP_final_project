        "content": "Holy shit y'all.\n\nIn case you missed it, Reddit turned on a harassment filter not too long ago. See my [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shittyaskflying/comments/1cs2qs8/announcement_harassment_filter/) for details.\n\nIt is turned on low. I thought there might be the occasional extra post or reply removed, but holy shit. 10-20 (on average) new removals a day. I take a glance at them and might let one or two through, but the rest I have to agree with.\n\nThis IS a shitposting sub. I expect some of the shitpost comments to be caught in the filter, but what I wasn't expecting was SO MANY things being caught. Things that, while clearly meant in a satirical/shitpost/not serious way, the admins of reddit and their vaunted algorhythms could easily use to shut us down if they wanted. \n\nI'm going to be clear. I don't typically browse shittyaskflying. I am not going to see the vast majority of the comments. I rely on reports, automoderator, and now the harassment filter to catch things. \n\nI wonder what would happen if I turned the harassment filter to high........ You know, for science lol.\n\nDon't worry, I'm not planning on actually doing that.....\n\nEDIT: Maybe I will turn it to high for a week or something. See how that impacts things. If I do, I won't tell anyone when. I don't want people to TRY to get more caught. But I will tell people after!",
