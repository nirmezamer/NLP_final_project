So he donated the house to a charity\u2026which then re-listed the house for ~$35 million. \n\nHere\u2019s the Zillow link to the Alexandria home, along with an Axios article about it: \n\n- https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/7979-E-Boulevard-Dr-Alexandria-VA-22308/82741014_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare\n\n- https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2024/06/28/dan-snyder-virginia-estate-river-view-listing\n\nAnd here\u2019s the Zillow link for the Potomac property: \n\n- https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11900-River-Rd-Potomac-MD-20854/37151807_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare",

Snyder is saying that the house then is worth 43 million dollars. That's 2800 a square foot. It feels like that's what my house is worth based on what people charge me to maintain it, but it'd be hard to actually justify that cost.
