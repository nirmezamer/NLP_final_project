History is my forte and ultimately I want just an office job with a good income that can give me a place on my own with a nice house and have all the things a middle class guy in the United states has. People tell me that history is a useless major here as northern virginia is huge with data centers, IT, and government work (I'd have no problem working in government). Am I setting myself up for failure? Because if I'm unable to get a good paying comfy job I really don't want to have to work in construction or in a trade. ",

            "This isn\u2019t really answering your question but I just want to say that a nice house is no longer a middle class thing anymore. Especially not in this area. You have to be married and have 2 decent incomes to even have a shot these days.",
            "fellow history major here.\n\nI'm not gonna say you're definitely screwed, but I've never once worked in anything close to my degree. I've done well for myself, though. \n\nI graduated in 2006. My first job was with GEICO, I would not recommend that, but it's not terrible. I had an application in with one of the three letter agencies based on recommendations from parents of my friends who worked for the \"State Department\" (nudge nudge wink wink). They're looking for people from all backgrounds and history is a good one, especially if you've focused in a current region of interest. I got a phone call and was told I had been selected for further consideration, but my dumb ass said \"no thanks, I already have a job\".\n\nI've bounced around a bit, also being military helped, but most of my life has been government or government-adjacent. Now I write defense policy.",
