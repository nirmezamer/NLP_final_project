            "The fact that friendly fire in Arena is enabled before the round has started is a huge mistake. I've run into people griefing each other and shooting each other but not killing before the round has started. Huge oversight. Guns should be disabled until the start of the round. There's no reason my teammates should be able to shoot me before the fight has actually begun.",
            "I had 4 minute cooldown on scav, now it\u2019s back to 17 minutes, what happen and how to get back to those 4 min cooldowns? Rep the same 1.37.",
            "I swear the longer I play a session of Arena the worse packet loss and desync get.",
            "I tried PvE for the first time and my wait time to factory was around 8 minutes. Turned it off.",
            "Anyone know when the next patch is?",
            "Does anyone know why weapons handling and movement feels really off in Tarkov Arena compared to the main game?  I checked my sensitivity, it checks ok with my matcher but still feels a bit weird, then spray transfer and shooting while moving just seems terribly inaccurate compared to the main game.",
            "Trying to get back into Tarkov, is the game worth playing rn? As in whats the cheater situation? And is it riddled with bugs?",
            "Were post flairs reduced? I cant find the clip flair I use to shitpost",
            "What's the current state of the game? I'm interested in buying, but is it still riddled with cheaters and fully-geared vets except in the first week of the wipe?",
            "The prior patch addressed my significant stability issues (regular crashes) and getting stuck on Loading loot...entering a raid.  With the patch today all of the issues are back. I don't understand how a patch gets released that reintroduces issues that were fixed. Incredibly demoralizing."

            "Personally I'm surprised there isn't an event this week. One every couples weeks, especially this late in the wipe is kind of disappointing, and it's been two since the last one. Credit where credit is due, the last two have been some of the most fun ones I've had in my 6+ years of playing. I'd just like to have them be more frequent, especially when there is not much time left in the wipe and the game would benefit from people being drawn back in woth some cool stuff happening.",
            "Why are there so many out of region players on european servers?\n\nWhy is this allowed/possible? Ban VPN's!!\n\nAlso the performance of the game gets worse after every patch."
