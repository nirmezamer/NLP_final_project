            "Personally I'm surprised there isn't an event this week. One every couples weeks, especially this late in the wipe is kind of disappointing, and it's been two since the last one. Credit where credit is due, the last two have been some of the most fun ones I've had in my 6+ years of playing. I'd just like to have them be more frequent, especially when there is not much time left in the wipe and the game would benefit from people being drawn back in woth some cool stuff happening.",

            "hey guys i just played a game on ground zero and got killed by a lvl 30 pmc when i am lvl 1. i believed it was level 20's and under in one group and 21's and above in another. and thats what it says on the wiki. so how can this be? have they changed it?",
            "With the new event, do we know if PVE players get to keep the flair unlock?",
            "I haven't played in about a year and a half. Is there anywhere I can go to see whats different about the game? I feel like theres been a lot of changes and I just want to make sure I'm playing correctly.",
