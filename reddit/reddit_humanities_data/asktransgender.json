Over the years, my role has changed from knocking out the queue every night to keeping an eye out for threats against our community and speaking on our behalf when I can.\n\nThis has also meant there are plenty of times when I haven't been as active as I could have been or times when I've been burnt out just from all the stuff I've been juggling.  \n\nBut through it all, Java's been there. Steadfast and reliable. Year in, year out. I can't say we've always agreed on everything, and Java's also been right there to let me know when I'm doing something foolish, too, which fortunately hasn't been *too* often. I'm human, too, and I've had my share of moments where I've been bullheaded because I believed I was doing the right thing.  \n\nIt's a hard thing sometimes to stand up for what you believe in, but it's harder still to step up and tell a friend when they're being an ass, and Java's helped keep me on track there more than once.  \n\nJava's also been an absolute monster on our modqueue for *ages*. I know I can step away and do more things for the community as a whole because I know each subreddit has good people to tend to it and pick up the slack while my eyes and ears are elsewhere. Java's one of those people whom I trust; Java's got rock solid trust because Java *is* a rock solid person.  \n\nIf our mod team was a person, was a single body composed of different parts, I'd say Java was our spine. Moving us, supporting us, responding to new threats, keeping us flexible, helping us navigate the shifting political landscape. You can't put a price on a person like that.  \n\nIf we had a subreddit MVP award, Java *easily* would have earned it several years in a row. That is not in any way a joke or an exaggeration; Java put the effort and the time in, and I'll be sad to see them go, but I also understand why stepping away can be a relief, too.  \n\nBest of luck in all things, and I hope to see you around here and there.

            "As stated elsewhere in the thread, transandrophobia/transmisandry is real. It's a lived experience for trans men and transmasc folks, particularly in more \"feminist\" spaces where masculinity in general is demonized, but in the wider world as well. \n\nSome people consider the term transmisandry problematic because they believe that it suggests misandry is a thing, rather than realizing it's termed such because it's trans-andry, not because misandry is a thing. Similar vibes for transandrophobia. \n\nSome people consider the concept problematic because they believe that any bigotry transmasc (as an umbrella term) folks face is simple transphobia (or, rarely, misdirected transmisogyny, though many claim that there's no such thing as misdirected transmisogyny). Because men and masculinity are valued in a patriarchal society, clearly there's no bigotry that transmasc folks face *because* they're specifically transmasc. The bigotry they face is because they're trans, instead. However, when trying to talk about transmasc-specific issues, folks were also written off for claiming it as transphobia, as transfemmes folks didn't face such issues. It became a catch-22 where transmasc folks were essentially forced to sit down and shut up (ironically, a form of transmisandry, I would argue). \n\nThe argument flares up on internet spaces on occasion, primarily, but has begun bleeding into offline spaces as well. It's a vicious cycle where transmasc folks are rarely allowed to talk about our struggles in a serious and specific fashion, and then people tell us that we're not really facing true bigotry because they never hear about our struggles.

I stay out of spaces that are big into using the word because of that. It's real Twitter / Tumblr discourse brainrot.\n\nHaving said that, I think there's value in having a word for bigotry against transmasc people specifically rather than it just being transphobia. I can say I experience biphobia, which is a unique experience from experiencing homophobia and lesbiphobia, and I can say that I experience enbyphobia or exorsexism as a non-binary person that's a specific form of transphobia - I have experiences unique to being a trans man and it'd be useful to have a word that can encapsulate that, rather than just 'transphobia directed at transmasculine people'.",

But there is no systemic prejudice against men, so there can be no intersection of transphobia with something that does not exist, therefore transandrophobia cannot exist.\n\nExcept that's not what transandrophobia is, and thats not how words work. Here's what happened:\n\nPeople noticed there was prejudice against trans men - a type of transphobia that targets trans men, or elements of transphobia that have a specific effect on trans men. People wanted a word to describe that so they could talk about it and address it, and since it was targetted at men, they chose transandrophobia. This seemed like a reasonable choice.\n\nBut the discourse!\n\nThat should be largely ignored. Transandrophobia is a real thing. It might not be exactly the mirror of transmisogyny but it is a thing that exists, it needs to be talked about and addressed, and transandrophhobia is a fine word for it.",

Even if your expression aligns with gender norms, people will still make mistakes with assumptions. I don't know about you, but assuming every person is trying to invalidate you results in a lot of hurt feelings and a lot of alienation, particularly by potentially well-meaning allies and other queer folks. \n\nRather than act like you're being invalidated, consider who you're invalidating so you can feel valid by expecting every person to assume your gender.",

            "Radical feminism is defined by overcoming male oppression of female people. A huge part of the oppression of female people is based in gender roles and gendered socialization. A huge part of radical feminism is completely ending the concept of sex distinction having any importance socially, culturally or politically, and a lot of radical feminism is based in resisting and ultimately overthrowing gender. So people having sex/gender identities that don\u2019t fit the most simplistic radical feminist narratives was seen as an issue. The solution was to call us fuck ups, perverts, and insane people, which was easy because that\u2019s what cis people had already been doing for decades in the name of psychiatry.\n\nSo, all this is happening in the late 1960s to the late 1970s. You have all that going on at the same time transsexual women began existing in society and refusing to be seen as crossdressers or drag queens. Some of these transsexual women were accepted into radical feminism, and did amazing work. Some of these transsexual women wanted medical treatment. Transsexual medicine was pretty fucked up at this time. Cishet white male doctors were weird and had weird ideas. One of the loud ones, Dr. John Money, was super fucking creepy, like mad scientist level creepy. Transsexual medicine was very gatekept, with women having to live as very stereotypical women for (a) year(s), they had to be straight, and they pretty much had to be white.    \n\nSo, all this intersects with Janice Raymond, a radical feminist, who decided the absolutely most disgusting thing she could imagine is transsexual women, and she wrote a book that is just absolutely full of hate and dehumanization of transsexual women. Mostly it is based on these ideas: (1) there is something inherently wrong with male human beings that they cannot escape (this is biological essentialism and is counter to radical feminism); (b) the cis white male doctors who are helping transsexual women are creating replacements for cis women based on the worst gender stereotypes; and (c) a lot of really mean shit about trans medicine as it existed at the time.    \n\nRaymond\u2019s book came out and transsexual women who were part of any feminist movement were subject to violence toward not only them but any women who would let them be part of radical feminist separatist spaces and orgs. It\u2019s little wonder that happened since Raymond directly accused trans women, **by name**, of \u201cr*ping\u201d cis women by just existing as post-op transsexuals.    \n\nWhere are trans men in all this? Dismissed as female, pitied for mutilating their amazing bodies that they could easily come to love, and erased by inclusion in radical feminism by radical feminists, just like gender critical does still. In fact, the surprising part for me, in reading Raymond\u2019s book, was that it\u2019s the exact template for cissexism and transmisogyny still used by Joanne and friends.    \n\nA few notes if you\u2019re interested in reading more. Raymond\u2019s book is radioactive. I read it early transition and sobbed in the library. So don\u2019t go wading into that shit unless you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019re ready. Sandy Stone is a goddess who was one of the women named in Raymond\u2019s book and 8 years later she responded. Raymond\u2019s book was called The Transsexual Empire (1979), so Sandy\u2019s essay was called The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttransexual Manifesto (1987). Essentially Sandy said \u201cyeah, transsexual women behaved in line with gender stereotypes because that\u2019s what got us medical treatment.\u201d More importantly, in my opinion, she humanized transsexual women and asked other transsexuals to discuss their experiences so pigs like Raymond would have a harder time making up weird shit about us.\n\nThis interview is probably the best short way to learn a lot of early history between transsexual women and exclusionary radical feminists:    \nSandy Stone on Living Among Lesbian Separatists as a Trans Woman in the 70s    \nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/zmd5k5/sandy-stone-biography-transgender-history",
            "Because a key tenet of most radical feminism is that men are inherently, biologically evil. It forces them to come to a lot of objectively silly conclusions. Best way I've seen it described is that feminists are fighting for a better world - radical feminists believe the fight is already lost, and want to negotiate the most favorable terms of surrender.",

            "I wish there was sociology and history of radical feminism.\n\nOne book I recommend is *Why Would Feminists Trust the Police?: A tangled history of resistance and complicity* by Leah Cowan. It explains a lot about how British feminism is very classist, and has been captured by the state.",
            "Radical feminism sees the world as a dichotomy between the oppressors and the oppressed. Historically, the movement seeks to eventually eradicate that dichotomy, but that's never worked in practice because it's foundation in black and white thinking tends to attract people who think in black and white terms. In that aspect at least, TERF's fit in perfectly.",

There is no such thing as \u201cTERFs vs actual radical feminists\u201d\u2014TERFs **ARE** radical feminists. **Radical Feminism was a specific movement of Second Wave Feminism in 1960s through mid 1980s that took the racist bio-essentialism of the First Wave and applied it to gender.** It gave rise to Political Lesbianism and Lesbian Separatism. Intersectional Feminism and Womanism developed in opposition to this during the Third Wave in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\n>**Radical Feminism is and always has been bio-essentialist and transphobic. TERFs and radfems are one and the same. They have a specific ideology, and that ideology is inherently bio-essentialist.**\n\n>Just because something is labeled \u2018feminism\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it is good. Saying TERFs aren\u2019t real feminists is a No True Scotsman fallacy. Feminism isn\u2019t an idea, it is a movement of people, and people can be fallible. Feminism and feminists must still be scrutinized and held to account.\n\n>**TERFs are not conservative. There are conservative transphobes, but TERFs are by definition and have always been politically liberal.**\n\n>Many of you are young and have only known the term \u2018TERF\u2019 as associated with J.K. Rowling, Posie Parker, and other prominent women who are classical liberals and who have recently started appealing to the transphobia among conservatives to galvanize support for their cause. These are NOT historical TERFs, but are politically classical liberal, non-academic lay people that have only recently adopted TERF talking points.\n\n>TERFs emerged as Second Wave Radical Feminists with a specific focus on trans people in the late 1970s and grew in predominance through the 1990s, with Janice Raymond\u2019s *Transsexual Empire* and later J. Michael Bailey\u2019s *The Man Who Would Be Queen*.\n\n>\u201cTERF\u201d was a term coined by TERFs for TERFs. When intersectional feminism and womanism called them out on their bio-essentialism, they re-branded as \u201cGender Critical\u201d, and made a push starting in the 2000s with the advent of wide, publicly available internet access to make appeal to young girls and women with the term \u201cradfem\u201d\u2014which has been very successful for them, as evidenced by the many young trans women and non-binary people even here who don\u2019t know what historical Radical Feminism actually is, think \u201cradical feminism\u201d is a good thing, and even adopt radfem ideology on a surface level without really understanding it.\n\n>J.K. Rowling isn\u2019t a TERF, she is a lay \u2018liberal\u2019 (in the classical liberal sense) who has been radicalized by TERFs. Rowling and many like her have become a popular face for TERF talking points, but she and they are not the progenitors of TERF/GC/Radfem ideology, but products of it.\n\n>This bears repeating: \u2018Feminism\u2019 isn\u2019t an idea, it is a movement composed of people, and that movement developed from various historical roots, was always diverse and never uni-vocal, and has since developed and still is developing in many disparate streams. There is no such thing as a \u2018true feminist\u2019 or \u2018actual feminism\u2019;  rather, there are many streams of feminist thought, ideology, and political orientations. Some of those streams are deeply rooted in bio-essentialism that goes all the way back to the First Wave. TERFs are not new, and they are not and never have been politically conservative or right wing. Popular contemporary classical liberal figures radicalized (\u201cpeaked\u201d, as they call it) by TERFs are not the academics and activists who radicalized them and do not define the movement.\n\n>Feminism is not a monolithic concept that is \u2018good\u2019 in opposition to the \u2018bad\u2019, but a complex, striated movement among people with various ideological, philosophical, and political positions. Feminism itself must still always be examined, critiqued, and held to account. Intersectional Feminism is what will move us forward. Radfem and its predecessor Second Wave Radical Feminism is and always has been bio-essentialist and transphobic.",
            "They're not feminists.\n\nIt's impossible to be anti-trans and pro-women.  It's misogyny all the way down.",
            "Mostly they're more concerned with being obsessively transphobic than actually fighting for women's rights. They very rarely talk about abortion rights, domestic violence or sexist discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThey're more concerned about the issues that they have imagined in their heads.",
            "Radical Feminists (and TERFS by extension) aren't feminists. They USE feminism as a front and an excuse to promote misogynistic gatekeeping on women, both trans AND cis. They are rooted in biological essentialism."
