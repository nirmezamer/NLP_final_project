I'm always updating this map.**\n\nAre you thinking of starting HRT, but are worried about:\n\n- Finding a clinic\n- Having to do a year of therapy\n- Having to do \"real life experience\"\n- Getting gatekept\n- Spending money and not getting treatment\n\nWell... that is why **informed consent** exists. With informed consent, you require **no letters from therapists.** You simply attest your gender identity, say that you understand the risks and benefits of hormone therapy, and they begin prescribing and monitoring your hormone levels.\n\nSo... For too long, this information has been scattered around Reddit, Susans place, twitter, various out of date guides from different regional organizations, so...\n\nI laid my eyes on every single clinic website and doctor profile listed in this map. You should be able to call up any of them to confirm, and then start your HRT as soon as possible.\n\nPLEASE let me know if any of these are out of date or if I am missing some.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=42.47025816653199%2C-97.03854516744877&z=4",

            "Aw man, I excitedly clicked this in case you found something I didn't, but alas the only thing you found was our subpar PP. I live in Wilmington, NC, and the Planned Parenthood here only lists \"education, resources, and services referral\" under LGBTQ services. The closest PP with HRT services is either Fayetteville or Raleigh depending on traffic.\n\nEDIT: Also I \"visited\" Atlanta recently (we were escaping Dorian's path lol) and I checked ahead of time to see if I could get HRT there - I think only one of the PPs offered it.",
            "I just want to chime in and say that I wouldn't recommend the Emma Goldman clinic in Iowa City, Iowa to anyone looking to transition. The nurse practitioner there that actually has to prescribe hormones is a terf. I've had several good friends go there and none of them have had a good time. some of the things they have experienced are dead naming, late prescriptions, out of date information regarding hrt and care for trans women, and just in general a very hostile environment. planned Parenthood should be a better option, but I have no personal experience with them.",

It's messed up!",

            "Kinda. As least for Testosterone (which would not be a pill), some effects are temporary and some are permanent. The temporary ones would be like fat redistribution, or active hair growth in male-typical areas. These only happen if you are taking T. Permanent effects would be the voice getting deeper, male pattern baldness that had already happened. Once the T leaves your system, these remain the same unless you do some external thing, like voice training to make it higher. It won\u2019t just go back to how it was before. Some people, like myself, are only interested in certain permanent changes. So for me, I can stop once I\u2019ve received the desired effects.",
            "We take them forever otherwise you would revert. As for cost, in my country its basically nothing. 10 dollars for a month supply of injections vials. 15 dollars a month for a blocker (bica), and 3 dollars for a month supply of estrogen pills. Thats without insurance\n\nAlso a lot of internal/brain changes happen when being on HRT, it\u2019s not just about looks",
            "I\u2019m a trans man so I can\u2019t speak for trans women, but I personally stopped T after a bit less than 2yrs on it cause I just had the effects I wanted and nothing changed",
