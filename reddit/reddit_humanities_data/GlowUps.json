This includes speculative or accusatory comments about other members' transformations.\n* Members may **only** ask an original poster (OP) if their transformation involved the use of PEDs to clarify the nature of their glow-up.\n* If an OP is found to be dishonest about their PED usage, they will face a ban to ensure transparency and honesty within our community.\n* Discussions that question or criticize the OP's decision regarding PEDs, especially if they become hostile or critical, are not permitted and will result in a ban for the offending commenter.\n\n**Please note:** No warnings will be issued for violations of this rule. This strict enforcement is to prevent discord and ensure that our community remains a positive and supportive environment for everyone's personal growth and transformation journeys.\n\n#",
