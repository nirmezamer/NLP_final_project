        "content": "We've received many questions for **recommendations on books for Investing & the Stock markets.** We've curated a list of our 13 favorite books on Investing & the Stock Market, and explanations on what the books are about.

[You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  Book Descriptions & Covers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**How to Make Money in Stocks**](https://amzn.to/3ujiApd) **by William O'Neil**\n\n* This book is about growth investing. O'Neil explains what most successful stocks have done to be successful. He explains his 'CANSLIM' method, which is an acronym for 7 fundamental criteria which you can use to pick stocks. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return from 1998-2005 (Second place). First place was Martin Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% (we will get to Zweig on this list too)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqsteucgng191.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce61da8980efdfe0ecef663ab05a97f4838182dc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://amzn.to/2OfR4d9) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* The idea of this book is to buy undervalued good businesses and hold them long-term, which will eventually beat the market index.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmrq2minng191.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=46dd18b57e2bdc7afb8fa1f5e1ff025615d16a76\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3ud6E8A) by Burton G. Malkiel\n\n* This book covers investment bubbles, fundamental vs. technical analysis, modern portfolio theory, index funds, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7t5gloong191.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d43edcd511ef371a506419cec2ac8462a7d844a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Principles](https://amzn.to/3wk9CtU) by Ray Dalio\n\n* This book provides the insights from one of the biggest hedge fund managers of all time, and I think there are many great lessons to learn in this book!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwv7dc4png191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5d86b9f669f59e1240f53628e59daf3ae97323\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [One Up On Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rEN9E9) by Peter Lynch\n\n* This book emphasizes the advantages that individual investors hold over institutional investors (when it comes to finding investment opportunities). Lynch also gives many of examples of mistakes he has made, and how he has learned from them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3hze2lpng191.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94cbc8e20e50f7cd9b92a67c140952529bd0d04\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Big Secret for the Small Investor](https://amzn.to/3fHyJ3I) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* Greenblatt explains why index funds can be better than actively managed funds. The big secret is maintaining a long term perspective!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvhszg2qng191.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc31f381276a372d5cb2eeb1c0afa91fb253454\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Winning on Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rH4TyH) by Martin Zweig\n\n* Zweig's success came from his ability to predict the bigger picture (such as trends in the broader market). The combination of his stock picking skill, general market understanding, and market timing, made him one of the great investors of stock market history. Zweig was more interested in growth than value. Unlike Buffett, Zweig isn't a 'buy and hold' investor. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% from 1998-2005. He was #1 out of 56 others, including Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, O'Neal's CAN SLIM, Motley fools, and using ROE, P/E's etc. Second place was O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tysdlflqng191.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8ce17fd8550c7fd873d563fa3b90cd82b8c005\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Irrational Exuberance](https://amzn.to/3mbTjKQ) by Robert Shiller\n\n* Shiller makes strong argument that perfect market theory is flawed. The Idea of perfect market theory is basically that the markets are all knowing and completely rational, and in the long run can't be beat. Therefore , you can control costs with index funds and diversification. (You can't beat the market, therefore controlling costs and diversifying seems like logical strategy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l01rs20rng191.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=151c657fc6b320267ae031848aa220565c024e7b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://amzn.to/3uaehfS)\n\n* The key concepts of this book are risk tolerance, asset allocation, a balanced portfolio, tax efficiency and cash management. This book explains many of the pitfalls of investing. The Bogleheads and Jack Bogle preach the power of compound interest. Investing in low-fee index funds and holding them long-term is the method. This book gives an excellent, detailed rundown of how to implement this kind of investment plan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqmzqqerng191.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=942f56ed1175ccb9c7e5652f647b7ad24dd17228\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Common Sense Investing](https://amzn.to/3ucV0dW) by John Bogle\n\n* Great information for anyone who is trying to make sense of personal finance and basic investments. This book explains why passive investing is a worry free, long-term strategy that consistency wins over time, and why active trading always returns to the mean.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7aw2btrng191.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d706a714a567b2e59a27f840328cce4496408f0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.to/2PqdzMQ) by Benjamin Graham\n\n* This is a great book for anyone who is interested in introducing themselves into the world of investing, or wants to get better at investing. This book gives lots of valuable information to help one understand the basics of value investing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jux3a18sng191.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca28ae1e0affb69e1c1717da5d18b86660c4642\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need](https://amzn.to/3ugMSJu) by Andrew Tobias\n\n* This is a book for people looking to learn the basics of investing and saving money\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8odacksng191.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b6ef78987fd43e278b18f267c8ce8621ef4d5f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* This is not a book for beginners. Greenblatt gives a nice exposition of some more \"special situation\" investment styles & areas of equity investments (mergers, spin-offs, rights offerings, etc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjm6kxzsng191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d6fb469143339516c9012b6b7d60162ffab565",

The baseline standard has shifted to be inclusive of those not qualified for general entry level positions.\n\n\nThe problem is employers don't need a college degree but the public education system isnt trustworthy enough to produce capable workers.",
            "In many cases, employers don't demand higher ed degrees because they need them ... they demand them because they can.\n\nIt's just a side-effect of the push to make it a lot easier for more people to go to college.

There is a 4 yr program at many universities already if you\u2019d like to teach or become management. The sad thing is because of technology it\u2019s become a much more efficient and easier job so I\u2019m confused what they would \u201cteach\u201d with 4 more semesters. Not a fan of the idea.",

If you're graduated college with a bachelor's, I know you've done these sort of things in your classes.",
