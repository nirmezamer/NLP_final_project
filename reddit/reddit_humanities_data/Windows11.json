After recently finding out that Bitlocker was only using software encryption, I was forced to reinstall the OS again to enable hardware encryption. Now Windows claims it's unable to activate, even after manually typing in my own key because \"it looks like the hardware on this device has changed\" when it definitely hasn't. Now looking at the product key on the bottom of that settings page, it clearly seems to insist on using what seems like the original key that was preinstalled with my G14 which was for the Home edition and it's not letting me replace it with my Pro key due to the error message above.",
