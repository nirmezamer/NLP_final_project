I\u2019m worried about getting overstimulated and melting down or not being able to finish the tattoo. I\u2019m high functioning I\u2019m just scared because I do have a decent amount of sensory issues.",
            "Hi! It might feel out of topic, but I'm an aspiring tattoo artist and was looking for information about how you started. I feel a bit lost. I know that I have to draw, I have a good basis (anatomy and can draw in different styles), and I practice. But I don't know where to start to get a \"book\". Should I draw flash tattoo sketches? Should I explore how to place a tattoo? Should I learn how to draw in American Traditional, Neo Traditional, New School, Black and Grey, Realism, Japanese, Tribal, Script / Lettering, Watercolor, and Geometric tattoo styles? I have no idea.",

            "Hi! Have no tattoos but I have an idea of the first one I wanna get, but its not something I've seen before and I think I'd feel more confident in getting it, if I saw how it looked on me. Anyone have advice on the best way to get like a \"test print\" done? I'm totally new to this so dunno if this sounds stupid but I'm looking almost for a sharpie version of it on my body so I can spend a day (or hour) looking at it and seeing if it looks how I want.\n\nAnyone have any leads on how I can do this? More than happy to pay an artist to do this for me, if thats the best recommended path.\n\nThanks!",
            "If there are any tattoo artists in here, has anyone brought an AI generated tattoo to you? If they have, did you tattoo it on them?\n\nMy friends and I were talking about them and we\u2019re pretty divided on it. But none of us are tattoo artists. Just looking for some opinions from artists.",
            "So far I've got one tattoo, wrist/lower arm, all tickety-boo. I'm ready for my next one, I know what I want and that I want it to go on my thigh, above the knee.\nI live in Scandinavia, so it's gonna be warm for the next 3, 4 months,  then shorts and dresses without tights are a no go.\nShould I try to see if someone can get me in in the next month or so, so I can let it breathe as much as possible? Or is it wiser to get it in autumn, so I don't have to cover it when swimming outside? Obviously that will mean fabric covering it pretty much all the time.",
            "Is there actually a big difference between a very expensive tattoo gun and a cheap knock off? I\u2019m asking about the battery powered ones.",

I'm having a very difficult time finding exceptional artists for these.I love tattoos of the human figure and florals/animals in particular. Pls help I've been looking for so long",
            "Does anyone know of any tattoo artists near NC who do softer realism? I like the styles of @dorok.tattoo (insta) and @mustafaalakoc_ (insta) but neither of them are even in the US. I haven\u2019t been able to find a tattoo artist with a similar style close to me. So I was just wondering if anyone knew of any? I\u2019m open to traveling a bit it doesn\u2019t have to be in NC. I just don\u2019t want to drive more than like 6 hours or so."

            "Hi everyone, I want to get my first tattoo done, but I'm unsure about the placement. The motive I want is a slightly modified version of this illustration\n\n[https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/sullivan/69.jpg](https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/sullivan/69.jpg)\n\nFor the placement I wanted my upper left arm and center the image right smack in the middle there. But I think that it is to big for my arm (circumference \\~ 32cm / 12.6 inches). The modifications to the image are mostly small things around the hourglass and the snakes body vertically elongating the whole image slightly.\n\nHas anyone done something similar in terms of size and placement?\n\nAnd the second question, how do you prepare individual images for a halve/full sleeve. If were to get the image above on my arm, how do I plan for the next bigger images or backdrops? Is that just an artist thing or are there good resources to look at?",
            "So I'm getting [this](https://imgur.com/a/M0CXJgH) on my shoulder later today, and I don't know how long it'll take. How long does it usually take for words to be tattooed? This is literally my first tattoo and everyone keeps asking me how long it'll take for me to get it done, but I don't know. (The \"2)\" isn't going to be part of the tattoo, just the words in black)",

A friend wanted to do an armband, which by itself is no big deal (the design to do is simple enough), but for the life of me, I can't get the stencil to line up perfectly... How do you, more experienced people do?\n If it helps, the width of the design is 8cm, top forearm measure is 27 and bottom is 22. \nThe design is just triangles, one up, one down and so on.\nThanks in advance for any help!!",
            "Anyone know any tattoo artists with designs that are very reminiscent of like 80s metal show flyer art? Like sorta zombie/demon maybe a little creepy gorey tattoos? Big horror and metal fan and got my first tatt which sorta is in line with that style. Much thanks to any help!"
