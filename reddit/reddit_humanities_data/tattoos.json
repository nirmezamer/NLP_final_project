            "Hey I\u2019m thinking about getting a tattoo. I\u2019m an autistic male has anyone that\u2019s autistic had tattoos before here? I\u2019m worried about getting overstimulated and melting down or not being able to finish the tattoo. I\u2019m high functioning I\u2019m just scared because I do have a decent amount of sensory issues.",
            "Hi! It might feel out of topic, but I'm an aspiring tattoo artist and was looking for information about how you started. I feel a bit lost. I know that I have to draw, I have a good basis (anatomy and can draw in different styles), and I practice. But I don't know where to start to get a \"book\". Should I draw flash tattoo sketches? Should I explore how to place a tattoo? Should I learn how to draw in American Traditional, Neo Traditional, New School, Black and Grey, Realism, Japanese, Tribal, Script / Lettering, Watercolor, and Geometric tattoo styles? I have no idea.",
            "Any tattoo artist recommendations in Croatia or Albania?",
            "If there are any tattoo artists in here, has anyone brought an AI generated tattoo to you? If they have, did you tattoo it on them?\n\nMy friends and I were talking about them and we\u2019re pretty divided on it. But none of us are tattoo artists. Just looking for some opinions from artists.",
            "So far I've got one tattoo, wrist/lower arm, all tickety-boo. I'm ready for my next one, I know what I want and that I want it to go on my thigh, above the knee.\nI live in Scandinavia, so it's gonna be warm for the next 3, 4 months,  then shorts and dresses without tights are a no go.\nShould I try to see if someone can get me in in the next month or so, so I can let it breathe as much as possible? Or is it wiser to get it in autumn, so I don't have to cover it when swimming outside? Obviously that will mean fabric covering it pretty much all the time.",
            "Is there actually a big difference between a very expensive tattoo gun and a cheap knock off? I\u2019m asking about the battery powered ones.",
            "Looking for a TRASH POLKA tattoo idea. Thinking a sleeve. I love the song \u201cDemons\u201d by Imagine Dragons and was hoping to capture some imagery and lyrics into the tattoo.",
            "I'm trying to find a fine line tattoo artist and/or baroque painting tattoos in WA/OR. From Seattle to Salem ideally, but im open to further away. I'm having a very difficult time finding exceptional artists for these.I love tattoos of the human figure and florals/animals in particular. Pls help I've been looking for so long",
            "Does anyone know of any tattoo artists near NC who do softer realism? I like the styles of @dorok.tattoo (insta) and @mustafaalakoc_ (insta) but neither of them are even in the US. I haven\u2019t been able to find a tattoo artist with a similar style close to me. So I was just wondering if anyone knew of any? I\u2019m open to traveling a bit it doesn\u2019t have to be in NC. I just don\u2019t want to drive more than like 6 hours or so.",
            "So I'm interested in getting a half sleeve traditional Japanese with a Koi on my upper left arm. I alredy have 2 tattoos on my lower arm that are not trad Japanese. One is a portrait of my dog who passed and the other is sone orchids that wrap around a bit on my forearm. Would these existing tattoos clash with a trad Japanese sleeve on the upper arm?"
