Don\u2019t any prior car sales experience, but I do have several years of Retail management experience, and I\u2019m fully aware that providing excellent customer service is a must if you want those valuable repeat buyers and referrals. Do you guys see green newbies in your dealers take a notebook to take notes or just try to have mental notes???? Or is that not a great idea? I\u2019d love your input. This is an awesome community. Thanks in advance for your time in answering my questions,",

            "#1 listen to your customer listen to what they say try to understand what they\u2019re looking to accomplish.\n# 2 if you\u2019re just not sure what you can do for them just ask (tell me what I can do to make this work out for you)\n#3 you must ask for the sale at some point when you can see they\u2019re happy with the car and they\u2019re interested say to them would you like to buy it that\u2019s too often forgotten.\n#4 it\u2019s great to have your product knowledge but it\u2019s even better to have people knowledge know what you have in front of you????? what I mean by that is understand your customers motivations and know what they want understand their desire for the car and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish armed with that information you can work miracles.\npeople do business with people they trust do not lie to your customer tell them the truth you are entitled to a profit but you never tell them what that profit is.\n#5 do not sit around in coffee clutches and gab about the store and about your lousy customers and your lousy management stay busy make phone calls by the door do whatever you can to get in front of people it is a numbers game.",
            "I'm on my 3rd week so far and I've sold 5. The paperwork is my issue. Nobody showed me what exactly we need in the jacket so I printed everything and let them toss what they didn't need. \n\nDon't be pushy but assume they're gonna drive the car and assume they loved it. A little enthusiasm has built me some good customers for the future. \n\nI talked to a couple I sold a truck to today for 2 hours about everything from kids, vacation destinations, home maintenance to the upcoming eclipse. Sold them the truck about 45 mins into that conversation.",

            ">I\u2019m fully aware that providing excellent customer service is a must if you want those valuable repeat buyers and referrals.\u00a0\n\n\n(Most) Toyota and Honda buyers will go the next dealership who can give them Free all season mats or another $100 discount.\n\n\nYou can build relationships but it's becoming more of transactional than \"I know a guy/gal who will take care of friends.\"\n\n\nStay active and don't want listen to negative Veterans who will tell you \"this place sucks\" somehow they are still there 12 years later.\u00a0\n\n\nYes, take notes and if you're shadowing, be a shadow and don't say anything to jeopardize sales person deal.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the 1st 60 days it's better to have a half than 0 deal. So turn your customer to another sales person before they leave.\u00a0",
            "I agree with everything the other poster wrote.. \nI would say the short list of things I didn't know when I was Green, that I found out after leaving the business.. \nCustomers would probably rather have their teeth drilled by a dentist rather than step on a car lot.. they are all,.. every last one of them warm prospects that cost an arm and a leg to bring on the lot..  most of them are scared that they will get taken advantage of (and for good reason.)\nIf you give them too many choices, they get paralysis of analysis, but if they don't get enough information, they'll never feel ready to commit to one vehicle/dealer. Three is about ideal,  letting them bump themselves up from the lowest to the highest ..\nCustomers typically know whether they want to buy from you within 10 seconds after meeting you.. so be genuine and be likable( literally be the new guy forever).. stay off politics and find the common ground,.. really listen to their pain points!!..  they're not buying a car for kicks.. \nAside from that I would just say to do you're very best to be crisp like Jake from State Farm, and never underestimate the power of great hygiene, extra shoes to rotate (because you'll be in them 12 hours a day.. imagine sitting in a test drive in a sealed car in July with the air running recyclingthe atmosphere of your sweaty feet! )a Listerine strip and a very subtle and lightly-applied clean smelling cologne. \nAfter you pass that hurdle, there's a million things you can do to say to blow a done deal.. so don't overdo it..\nDid I say Short list?? \ud83e\udd23 lmao",
