Don\u2019t any prior car sales experience, but I do have several years of Retail management experience, and I\u2019m fully aware that providing excellent customer service is a must if you want those valuable repeat buyers and referrals. Do you guys see green newbies in your dealers take a notebook to take notes or just try to have mental notes???? Or is that not a great idea? I\u2019d love your input. This is an awesome community. Thanks in advance for your time in answering my questions,",

This was taken instead of a 9-5 desk job that would pay 52k annual that sounded boring af.\n\nCurret payplan: 16/hr , scheduled for 40 hrs but typically 45-50 hour weeks.\n\nTiered commission but for simplicity, first 7 cars no commission, 8-12 makes 300 each, 13-17 makes 325, 18-22 makes 350, 23+ makes 375. Not retro.\n\nCsi 95% across the board to get any manufacturer bonus per survey (250$)\nAnd tiered back end 1% for first 7 ,2% (8-12), 3%, 4% ,5% etc.\n\nWill i ever see back end or csi pay? Or is it a bad plan ",

            "6 have been there for minimum 8 months, 2 new hires including me",
            "Yea first 7 dont qualify for the base comission, still counts for csi and backend tho but wont be seeing those for a while since i think those are rolling 90day averages. Only been a few weeks",
            "So that's an average of 15 cars/ 8 people (with the 80/20 rule the average is about 10 and your top 1 or two sell 20)\n\nWhere are you located? What does your market look like?",
            "If the hourly isn't a draw then I don't think it looks terrible, although I'm not a fan of flat rate pay structures...kinda removes the point of holding gross and making more for the company.\n\nAssuming you make 45 hrs/week  $16/hr ($37,440 /year) + (12 cars/month  300)  12) = $80,640/ year. I don't think that's too bad for 40 - 45 hours a week.\n\nThe only question at this point is; how many reps are there?",
            "I dont understand flat pay plans on sales.  Rewarding solely for volume reduces quality and CX.   The CSi pay is never happening.  \n\nSome franchises can get by with this, but the volume here seems way too low.  Show me a store with 350-375 units a month and <20 salespeople and I see volume working well.\n\nWhat manufacturer is this?"
