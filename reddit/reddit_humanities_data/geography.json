It should be situated somewhere around South Serbia, Kosovo or North Macedonia (in the area between Ka\u010danik, Skopje, Bujanovac, more or less). It is possible that the place has changed names since, or that there is a slight error in the transcription. My source is in Serbian, so I imagine there might be another macedonian/albanian name that would be more in use nowadays. Does anyone have a on where this place could be ?",

Downvote posts and comments that do not contain the type of content you'd like to see on this subreddit. This is quite literally why the downvote button is there. \n\n2. Stop commenting on low quality posts to call out OP. Reddit sees this as engagement regardless of what you say, and now you're boosting OPs post and encouraging more low effort posts from karma farmers. \n\n3. Stop making \"meme\" posts that complain about the current trend. You're just adding to the clutter, not being a hero. \n\n4. Report low effort and irrelevant posts. Enough reports on a post, it gets removed, it's that simple. \n\nThe mods have no intention of blanket removing trend posts at this time. Some trends actually drive discussion and allow your fellow users to learn more about the world, many do not. We don't have time to check each post and comment, we have jobs.

            "longest bridge over water is about 24 miles, and this bridge would be 26 miles",
            "I'm in Victoria. Originally from Vancouver.\n\nGenerally speaking, there isn't much will to put a fixed link to the mainland from those that live on the island. People here prefer the separation and not to be connected to Vancouver as it would create even more of a likelihood that the island communities would become bedroom communities of Metro Vancouver.\n\nSo, even if there was serious consideration to being connected through the US, the likely consideration would be through the San Juan Islands. However, would the San Juan Islands WANT to be connected to the US mainland as well?\n\nWhile I have never been there, our own San Juan Islands, the Gulf Islands, do not want to have a fixed link, to either Vancouver Island or the mainland. When a bridge to the mainland has been discussed as cutting through those Gulf Islands, there actually is something called the Island Trust which part of their governance forbids a fixed link connection, even a fixed link between the islands themselves.\n\nSo, what's the purpose of a fixed link connection? Beyond tourism, mainly it would be commercial traffic and delivery. So would it make sense to create a connection to deliver goods from Canada, where you need to cross the border twice to deliver them to the island.\n\nWhile you indicate that the part of the island / mainland are rocky and away from the population centers, the northern part of the island would make the most feasible sense to do. This has also been studied. The area on the mainland called the Sunshine Coast as well has no fixed link, and that even though it's part of the mainland, you need to take a ferry there. There has been talk about making a fixed link from Squamish and over, following old logging roads, and that this possibly could as well be considered to do some island hopping to Vancouver Island as part 2.\n\nWhile it seems like a poor place to do this, with upgrades to the highways leading to this, would allow for truck traffic to come through Hwy 99 and bypass Vancouver itself from a route from the interior.\n\nSo, while it could be more feasible to consider going through the San Juan Islands, I've never ever seen this discussed and with my rationale and reasoning, I don't see why this would even make sense. The north island route, one that would bypass the Gulf Islands and any potential floating bridge across Georgia Strait to as well accommodate boat shipping traffic could happen, seems like the most plausible if there is a will and desire to do this.\n\nIt would make no sense to me even if feasible to connect us from Port Angeles. There is no interstate going anywhere near there and the Olympic Peninsula itself is remote as a result.",
            "As other commenters pointed out, the parties involved likely do not want a bridge. The ferry systems (this one and other WA ferries) have worked very well for me in the past. What we need is a couple new ferry boats.",
            "It would cost an astronomical amount. And the engineering would be difficult. It would be easily one of the longest bridges in the world. Its deep water, and earthquake zone and a really busy shipping lane. It simply will never happen. The other question is do people on Vancouver Island even want a fixed link to the States? I don't think many do. The ferry service to the BC mainland could be improved for a fraction of the cost.",
            "It's an answer to a question that no one is asking.",
            "in addition to other things people have pointed out, the Puget sound is also quite deep. For example, there is an island west of Seattle called Bainbridge Island, and there is only ferry service to it but no bridge because if you dropped the space needle in that water you wouldn't be able to see it.  Iirc near Seattle the sound is like 400 feet deep",
            "Too long and that area gets high wind and heavy rain in the winter. Also disrupts shipping if not done properly.\u00a0 There is a ferry from Port Angeles so its really not needed.\u00a0",
