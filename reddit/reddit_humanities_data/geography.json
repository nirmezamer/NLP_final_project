            "Hello, I am looking at place called Ridumir in early XXth century sources. It should be situated somewhere around South Serbia, Kosovo or North Macedonia (in the area between Kaanik, Skopje, Bujanovac, more or less). It is possible that the place has changed names since, or that there is a slight error in the transcription. My source is in Serbian, so I imagine there might be another macedonian/albanian name that would be more in use nowadays. Does anyone have a on where this place could be ?",

I love its format and have been using it to try and memorize names+locations, but it has some problems.  \n  \nFirst off, its list of countries incomplete - like for example it doesn't have Greenland, Palestine, the Cook Islands, etc. It also uses the same shorthand for multiple countries, so for example if you put in \"congo\" you get both R. Congo and D. R. Congo.",

Realistically though, we can't spend all day removing posts, and there are only so many words we can blacklist through Automod before the only remaining passable words are numbers. \n\nWhat can YOU do to improve the quality of this subreddit? \n\n1. Downvote posts and comments that do not contain the type of content you'd like to see on this subreddit. This is quite literally why the downvote button is there. \n\n2. Stop commenting on low quality posts to call out OP. Reddit sees this as engagement regardless of what you say, and now you're boosting OPs post and encouraging more low effort posts from karma farmers. \n\n3. Stop making \"meme\" posts that complain about the current trend. You're just adding to the clutter, not being a hero. \n\n4. Report low effort and irrelevant posts. Enough reports on a post, it gets removed, it's that simple. \n\nThe mods have no intention of blanket removing trend posts at this time. Some trends actually drive discussion and allow your fellow users to learn more about the world, many do not. We don't have time to check each post and comment, we have jobs. Help us out. \n\nDo us a favor, if you want more high quality content in this subreddit, contribute higher quality content to the subreddit, and follow the guidelines above to police low quality content.",

            "Between about 30 degrees south of the equator, in a region called the horse latitudes, the Earth's rotation causes air to slant toward the equator in a northwesterly direction in the southern hemisphere. (The opposite in the northern hemisphere).  This is called the Coriolis Effect. The trade winds to switch directions south of the Horse Latitudes.  This means (in the southern hemisphere)  from 30 degrees to the equator, the prevailing trade winds move from East to West creating a rain shadow on the western side of the Andes.  South of the horse latitudes, it switches and the winds move west to east - just like across North America.  The rain shadow south of these latitudes is on the eastern side of the Andes - like the rocky mountains in the USA.",

            "It's an interesting phenomenon how Southern Chile becomes the luscious and green temperate/alpine rainforests of the Patagonia, but Southern Argentina becomes the barren and harsh Patagonian Desert. Then in the North, the opposite happens. Chile becomes the incredibly arid Atacama Desert, while Argentina becomes the luscious subtropical wetlands and jungles of the Selvas Misioneras. It's like a reverse rain shadow effect. I'm guessing it has to do with the direction of the wind currents, and where moisture in the air precipitates before being able to reach the other side of the Andes (basically a rain shadow effect). I know Atacama gets a double rain shadow effect, so it becomes unusually drier than any place on the planet outside the polar circle (technically the polar circles are full of frozen water though).",

            "Downward branch of the Hadley cell and rain shadow effect due to the mid-latitude westerlies.\n\nCan't believe nobody has discussed the Hadley cell yet. It is the reason deserts are common at 30 latitude and the reason for the equatorial trade winds. The equator is hottest area on the planet, on average. This heat causes upward motion along Y=0, and this in turn results in a large circulation with downward motion at 30. Downward motion = stable atmosphere = little to no rain."
