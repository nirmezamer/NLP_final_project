That being said, the mod team has been lenient so far to take action, considering the major influx of people new to the content and discovering the Daydream Hour and Bonus Chapter material for the first time.\n\nIt's cool, isn't it?\n\nThat being said, as the first season of the anime comes to a close, we're going to start enforcing this again. Too many posts are just pages from the official work with little to nothing added by OP's title.\n\nFigured it's better to let everyone know this way than by just starting to remove content without notice. Thank you for your understanding.",
