        "content": "Thank you to the moderators of r/Chipotle for the permission to post this invitation.\n\n----\n\nWe are inviting adults who have lived in the United States since January 1, 2015 to participate in research on the *human future that involves an interview and survey*.\n\nWhat are our greatest opportunities? Our biggest challenges? How are people thinking about recent challenges, like COVID-19? We\u2019re discussing issues ranging from technology and space to health and the environment. What will people think about emerging issues in 5 years? In 10 years?\n\n**There are academic fields of study related to the human future. However, much of this work is done without input from the public.** We want to change that.\n\nThe interview will take approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours to complete. **Participants will receive a $40 Amazon gift card** and the opportunity to enter a lottery for a chance to receive a second $40 gift card as compensation for their time and effort.\n\n----\n\nWe truly need to include input from *restaurant employees\u00a0and consumers.* **We want to speak with many occupations and groups**. We have already had participants representing several other areas, for example: human trafficking investigator, app engineer, spaceflight manager, bartender, veterinarian, nurse, musician, sales executive, farmer, psychologist, personal trainer, programmer, carpenter, nonprofit manager, fiction writer, attorney, accountant, artist, and more.\n\nThe project co-director is Marissa Yingling ([marissa.yingling@Louisville.edu](mailto:marissa.yingling@Louisville.edu)), who can schedule participation or answer any questions. Feel free to message u/HumanizingTheFuture with questions, too.\n\nWe are speaking to people in all states and the District of Columbia.\n\nWe also need participants who live in the following places:\u00a0*Alabama, California (except San Francisco), District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin*.\n\nThank you!",

Skimped wasn't one of them. \nI found out about the feed here when my account got scammed over 300 dollars and I did a general search and found this. Then found out it's done to various apps. \n\nI come for a laugh, tell a story, and learn what gets done outside of my bubble. I'd hate to see the other food feeds. Lol.",
            "I eat at chipotle like 2x a month and it\u2019s always great - sometimes they\u2019re out of chips but I usually go late. Employees are friendly, not skimped, always tip a few bucks. Guess I\u2019m the exception.",
            "Yes, it\u2019s ridiculous. You had a good experience? You are a corporate plant. You explain to someone how inflation works? They accuse you of raping 3 month olds babies cutting off their heads, then threaten to hijack your car, rape you, then kill you (not even joking I can post the screenshots if you want). Make a new alt sub to be less toxic? Apparently I\u2019m violating free speech by saying you can\u2019t make racist remarks. People have created a literal slur for chipotle workers, \u201cbean scoopers\u201d, and recommend shoving cameras in their face to try to get better portions.",
            "nah humans just don't feel the need to share positive experiences. i'd bet 95% of customers are pleased with their experience, 5% aren't, and maybe 20% of that 5% feel so inclined to post about it online."
