Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 71 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* As of April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)).\n* Tourists entering Japan should have their immigration and customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) (VJW). This will generate a QR code for immigration and customs, which can smooth your entry procedures. VJW is not mandatory. If you do not fill it out, you will need to fill out the paper immigration and customs forms on the plane/on arrival to Japan.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* **Important Digital IC Card News!** As of iOS 17.2, you can charge digital Suica cards with some (but not all) foreign Visa cards. See [this blog post](https://atadistance.net/all-about-apple-pay-suica-recharge/) from At a Distance for more information and ongoing updates, as well as our stickied thread in /r/JapanTravelTips.\n* **Important JR Pass News!** As of October 1, 2023, the nationwide JR Pass and many regional JR Passes increased significantly in price. Information you find on the internet or on this subreddit may now be out of date, as the price increase makes it so that the nationwide JR Pass is no longer a viable option for most itineraries. For more information on the JR Pass, including calculators for viability, see our stickied thread in /r/JapanTravelTips.\n* **Important IC Card News!** Although there is an ongoing shortage of regular Suica and PASMO cards, there are some reports that Suica cards might be starting to be available again at some stations. You can also still get the tourist versions of those cards (Welcome Suica and PASMO Passport). Please see our stickied thread in /r/JapanTravelTips for IC card info, details, and alternatives.\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in most circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/).\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html). If you are looking for information on finding pain or cold/cough medication in Japan, see [this FAQ section](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/#wiki_health).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/)",

            "I have been to japan for 3 weeks in december of 2022, and am planning another 3 week-ish trip over christmas/new year this year.\n\nLast time I was there, I made a mistake of zipping around Japan only seeing the main sights in each location which makes planning another trip difficult so I would welcome suggestions on where to go next time. I have already visited:\n\n* 3 days in Sapporo\n* 3 days in Osaka\n* 2 days in Kyoto\n* 1 day in Hiroshima city + 1 day in Itsukushima\n* 2 days in Kanazawa\n* a daytrip to nagano\n* a week in Tokyo (mainly the more central parts like Ueno, Shibyua, Tokyo station and the surroundings) and the following daytrips\n   * Base of mount fuji\n   * Nikko\n\nI will probably try visiting the Sendai and Aomori prefectures, but am not sure how much time that would take and what else to fit into my trip so I'm looking for suggestions",
            "I still have my Suica card from my trip in April, and im returning to Tokyo again end of september/Beginning of October, will it still work? Can I just add funds to it without getting a new one and I'm good to go?",
            "I heard the Suica card system has changed a bit and allows mobile cards now. When I was in Japan last year we had a Sanrio collab welcome suica card. Is that still an available option to purchase at the airport? I will be going later this year in November.",
            "What do you recommend to buy for hot and humid weather? :). Any like cool fans or mister umbrella?",
            "I'm able to visit Japan for two weeks and need to choose between August 1st-15th or September 5th-19th, or whether to forget it and choose a better time in the next two years. So:\n\n* August 1-15\n* September 5-19\n* Hold off and book at a future date\n\nI'm wondering if experienced travelers could tell me which choice is best, or perhaps the least miserable weather-wise. I'm from SoCal and can deal with heat, but I'm getting cold feet hearing about the humidity.\n\nThe climate data shows August to be the worst month, but many posts here show that September is brutal as well. It also seems hit or miss and some people get lucky.\n\nI had a full trip booked earlier this year, landed in Japan in February, but had to fly home for a family emergency immediately. So I really want to take this trip but don't want to regret it because I was impatient. Would be visiting Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto/Sapporo.",
            "I threw together a rough outline of a trip for next year in March together just to start getting things planned. Anyone have any suggestions? Trying to hit all the obvious spots and have some wriggle room if there's an obvious city/town I'm missing or if I should give another day to a certain place. Also let me know if something doesn't make sense logistically (mostly train/travel wise).\n\nhttps://prnt.sc/umFks-pUZIfT",
            "It would really depend on what your interests are, so you might want to say what they are. Northern Japan would be very cold and snowy at that time of year - why not head south?",
            "Yes, it will work fine.",
            "I enjoy historical sites (Nara was my favorite place when I visited first time), shorter hikes, and just exploring cities.\nI also enjoyed stuff like the Osaka Aquarium and the two teamlab exhibitions, but am not into music/arts.\nI also just really like trying out new foods.\n\nAnd about the weather, internet says that Aomori is usually between -5 and 2C which sounds completely fine (I was fine in Sapporo during -10c at night), and one of the reasons I want to visit Aomori is to see the high amounts of snow there since there's been almost no snow over the past 8 or so years where I live",

            "Hey! 25M solo traveler from Singapore, I'll be in Kyoto from 30/6 - 5/7 and Osaka until 9/7. Honestly pretty laid back on my itinerary, travelling to Japan has been a dream of mine and I'm just happy to go around taking cute or nice pictures wherever I go. So I'm perfectly fine accompanying someone else who wants a companion for their travels for a bit! Otherwise, I'd like to hopefully visit a few shrines near my accommodations, go for hikes (though it'll be hot/rainy), and generally experience/observe Japanese culture (except its clubbing part). My main goal in Japan is just to take a ton of pictures, so if you're interested in that as well, hit me up (I'm a novice at it though)! I speak English, as well as a tiny little bit of Japanese. I'd be happy to exchange socials!",

Into photography, food, cafes, bit of doodling, literature, architecture, haiku, speak very basic Japanese, German, bit of French Italian Russian. Mid Forties solo travel on moderate budget, any nice company for cafe, short hikes, Matsuri fun, cycling trips much appreciated. I booked Saiho-ji but would be interested in any tea ceremony, calligraphy, wagashi cooking class for a half day but too self-conscious to pitch up on my own.",
