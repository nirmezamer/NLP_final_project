        "content": "Hey everyone!  \n  \nI wanted to provide you an update on our work on Standard Rotation for PvP.\u00a0 Previously ([https://playruneterra.com/en-us/news/game-updates/whats-next-for-ranked-in-legends-of-runeterra/](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/news/game-updates/whats-next-for-ranked-in-legends-of-runeterra/)), we had announced that our next rotation would happen on August 1st later this year, and that we'd have a three month period for ongoing rotations.  \n  \nDue to development changes, we plan to shift these rotations to occur with patch releases (much like they have in the past), and I wanted to provide some additional transparency over what the next few patches look like. Instead of August 1st, the Standard Rotation will occur on July 17th, the release date of our 5.7 Patch. You'll also see these updates consolidated in our next set of patch notes.\u00a0The reason for these adjustments to our plan is that, having settled into our team's rhythm since January, we believe the team can handle having our releases for all content, both PvP and PvE, on a coordinated and consistent timeline.  \n  \nBeyond that, we'll have roughly two months of the Ranked Standard queue up, followed by one month of the Ranked Eternal queue up.\u00a0 Our next Standard Rotation would then come with patch 5.11, which would happen some time in November, and that pattern will continue moving forward. We'll be actively seeking feedback about how this approach feels, so please let us know your thoughts as these changes happen over the coming months!  \n",

            "Well, that's...interesting. Are we going to get previews of upcoming rotations, or should we simply wait for day of?",
            "Is the idea for Ranked Standard to be closed when Ranked Eternal is open? Currently we have both queues open but by your wording it sounds like that will change?",
            "Thanks for the update. So far this approach is fine to me, but please be careful about allowing overpowered champions into Standard. Elder Dragon in particular was about the worst possible choice as he is so splashable and brings with him so much free value. As I'm sure you're aware he essentially ruined last Standard season, causing many many players to quit. If this dynamic occurs again, an emergency patch that simply removes that champion from the rotation early would be greatly appreciated rather than leaving Standard to be near unplayable for an entire rotation.",
            "How often should we expecting balance changes? Can you not do what you were doing previously where the second patch of a cycle is focused on balancing?\n\nAlso love the most recent balance patch, just wish it was one patch sooner.",
            "To get the Top 100 title by the end of the season, do we need to finish top 100, or merely reach it? The announcement from a while back was not clear on this.\n\nAlso just to clarify: This season will run until July 17th, then a new season will start and last roughly 2 months, followed by 1 month of eternal?",
            "Interesting choice having rotation in the same time as new swarm mode gets added to league, I wanted to play rotation, but I also want to play swarm even more.... Oh well, looks like it's gonna be riot games on pc all day long",
            "So Elder Dragon is getting rotated early, I see this as a win",
            "Could anyone clarify on rewards for ladder? My understanding was the new Masters and Top 100 titles are happening but is that from July rotation or is this also for Dreamlit Paths season? If not, are there any rewards this time around?",

            "gloom is a status effect per se, it just sets the units health to negative which weirdly enough is not counted as damage. you should always avoid gloom on units that rely on dealing damage like swain (which i also learned the hard way). i think this is not a bug but intended.",

            "Because you're changing the stats of said unit. By 'dealing Gloom', you are giving that amount of keyword to the target. That's it, you deal 5 gloom = you give the keyword gloom 5 times.\n\nGloom however, reduces both the unit's max power and max health, and this calculation happens *after* the application of gloom, hence why it didn't count as damage.\n\nIt's the same way how Soraka and her landmark doesn't count health increase like +1, only actual healing, because those modifies the base stat, not change the current active stat. The end result might show the same number, but the game considers it two different changes."

        "content": "I'm enjoying playing her for the time, and I'm wondering which way I should build her.\n\nI've seen the docs and some threads and the general consensus are either\n\n- Icon of Valhir + Luden(s) so you hit *15* damage + however much power Taliyah has, which pretty much guaranteed to remove any opponent, provided you're not on Lissandra nodes.\n\n- GGC + Corrupted Star/Greenglade/Archangel, which focuses more on just spamming landmarks every turn to buff up your units through Taliyah's star power\n\n- Luminous + Starforged, which pretty much is the general BiS for champions that does not have a specific relic for them.\n\nEach has it pros and cons of course, and I can't really decide which one would be best in general. Skill focused one can really shred through anything, and if unblocked would still do 5-10 damage to the nexus, which can end the game in two turns usually. But Taliyah ends up being a dead card if you don't level her as she drops, because most of the time either your board will be full so her copying landmark ends up whiffing, or she's too weak to do much. Utility eases up on that making you able to to drop Taliyah whenever, because she's not the main damager, at least not immediately. This focuses more on ramping up though, and since Taliyah is already a 5-cost she's already pretty late. Starforged fixes this by amping the starting mana, but it doesn't really help Taliyah's gameplan at all aside from accelerating it by one turn.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best general option for her?",

            "Personally I'm leaning towards utility. If you play normally, the rockbears will grow so big that they can win games for you without ever needing to play Taliyah at all. Plus they take up so much space that Taliyah got no space to duplicate any landmarks. \n\nI've got Crownguard, Tempest Blade and Laurent Bladerack on mine. Usually my plays would be launching an attack, play Taliyah to stun & rally and go in for the kill.",
            "Icon of Valhir + Starforged Gauntlets + Luminous Orb\n\nLets you curve out effortlessly, and gives your units those powerful rocks volleys.",
            "Liminous + starforged + corrupted.\n\nCorrupted for board space, then titanic for mana gem.",
            "I've mostly played her with SFG, LO and Bladerack, which has worked fine. If you get her 6* power I think definitely go for the damage instead.",
            "Yea that's the problem I keep running onto too, that the board would just be so full that there's no more spaces to ramp up. Not rare that I had to just skip turn having 6 & 3 mana just because board is full. Hence why I put Corrupted Star, just to always free up that one extra spot. But since Taliyah's deck doesn't have that many keyword to begin with, in the end it's just one statcheck Taliyah, ending up not too dissimilar to the Luden+Icon build."
