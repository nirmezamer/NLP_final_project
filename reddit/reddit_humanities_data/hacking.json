        "content": "Before I begin - everything about this should be totally and completely ethical at it's core. I'm not saying this as any sort of legal coverage, or to not get somehow sued if any of you screw up, this is genuinely how it should be. The idea here is **information security.** I'll say it again. **information security.** The whole point is to make the world a better place. **This isn't for your reckless amusement and shot at recognition with your friends.** **This is for the betterment of human civilisation. Use your knowledge to solve real-world issues.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's no singular all-determining path to 'hacking', as it comes from knowledge from all areas that eventually coalesce into a general intuition. Although this is true, there are still two common rapid learning paths to 'hacking'. I'll try not to use too many technical terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is the simple, effortless and result-instant path. This involves watching youtube videos with green and black thumbnails with an occasional anonymous mask on top teaching you how to download well-known tools used by thousands daily - or in other words the 'Kali Linux Copy Pasterino Skidder'. You might do something slightly amusing and gain bit of recognition and self-esteem from your friends. Your hacks will be 'real', but anybody that knows anything would dislike you as they all know all you ever did was use a few premade tools. The communities for this sort of shallow result-oriented field include [r/HowToHack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack) ~~and probably r/hacking as of now~~.\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe second option, however, is much more intensive, rewarding, and mentally demanding. It is also much more fun, if you find the right people to do it with. It involves learning everything from memory interaction with machine code to high level networking - all while you're trying to break into something. This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF' hacking comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive hacking. Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease. The CTF community is filled with smart people who can't give two shits about elitist mask wearing twitter hackers, instead they are genuine nerds that love screwing with machines. There's too much to explain, so I will post a few links below where you can begin your journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember - this stuff is not easy if you don't know much, so google everything, question everything, and sooner or later you'll be down the rabbit hole far enough to be enjoying yourself. CTF is real life and online, you will meet people, make new friends, and potentially find your future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is CTF?

The idea of doing it for a living isn\u2019t just a dream it\u2019s something I am willing to give my all. Thank you for this information. Does anyone have any recommendations for a starter machine and OS that would be best as I learn and progress?",

You can go on google and learn stuff yourself and then go do hacking bounties but that's probably not going to pay the bills unless your some kind of genius. And if you're asking on here. You probably aren't. (Sorry) . Look into cyber security. Learn to code machine learning models. And start investigating how machine learning and cyber security can be used together.

Though software development can be generally useful; for example, being able to make fake websites can help social engineering.\n\nI think one misconception people have is that learning is a linear process.

In this case, you're still best off using physical penetration methods or phishing. As long as humans touch it, their interactions will always be the easiest hacks. If that still doesn't get it for you then go the OSINT route.\u00a0\n\nNo matter which path you choose, learning the aforementioned black hat ways is still a strong recommendation IMO.

And, yes, that choice can be changed at the drop of a hat (pun very much intended). You will also understand how easy it is to be well-intended and still make a black hat choice.\u00a0"
