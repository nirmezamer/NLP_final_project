I\u2019ve tried the Carne Asada and the Al Pastor and so far everything has been very tasty with plenty of meats and great sized burritos. Have you guys been and what do you like? The menu is pretty extensive actually and the one at this location has a list of all their foods on a big plastic sign that sits behind the counter where they take your money. The other one that I went to over by Lake Forest and I think Trabuco did not have that same sign but I think it\u2019s the same people. It might be a couple different groups of families doing it but they all look similar. Im curious y o see what you guys know about this and also what foods you guys have tried and like.\n",

            "OP, What are the prices? I noticed street vendors charging way more now. Just curious",

            "I\u2019m all for street food and small businesses, but this is not how you do it. Regardless of the sanitation concerns these pop ups are hurting the businesses that went through all the hoops and tape to operate legally. Imagine if you had a taco/burrito business and one of these opens in front of it. You can\u2019t compete with them because they could undercut you in price when they don\u2019t need to pay for permits, insurance, licensing, rent or taxes. There are so many ways to do this properly, like opening a stand at a Sunday market or opening a food truck. There are reasons we have these rules in place. I really can\u2019t support these stands and I\u2019m a huge fan of Mexican food and I\u2019m a democrat too lol. We need to remember that small business is very different than an illegal business.\n\nAlso, $11 for a burrito here sounds like a rip off lol. With all the fees they get to avoid it should be much less. Just saying.",

            "Anyone on here want to start a food stand business? i didn\u2019t realize it was this easy. We can get one of those ovens i keep seeing on YouTube and start selling pizza slices right next to these guys. Seems like a totally fair and legit way to do business."
