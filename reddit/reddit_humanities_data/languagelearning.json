Now it's the other way around.\nAlways remember you are learning something, that's something to be proud of. Show it.\nAnd don't forget it takes years to become fluent so relax and take it easy.\n\nAlthough I do recommend using anki and Duolingo. Both i never heard of when i started learning but they surely help to speedup things",
            "I think the difficulty of french is that the way things sound is so different from how its written. If you actually break down a recording of a natural sentence and compare what was spoken to what's written, you'll find unwritten contractions everywhere. entire words just replaced with a single consonant, but not indicated in writing anywhere. That said, I think if you can pay attention and identify those gaps, the spoken language will become easier with time.\n\nHere's a video from linguist Dr. Jones about this problem with spoken french vs french you're taught\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TAhbINAzcms?si=J6K0_I9AYaFAd6V1\n\nAnd another about the quirks of Quebecois \n\nhttps://youtu.be/bQaHzONra68?si=-wQehr_D2TCimGTl\n\nI think they're enlightening",

I\u2019m also doing lots of listening on YouTube, even if I have to set the videos on 0.5 speed. Actually writing things down has helped a lot. Shadowing and paraphrasing have helped with listening and speaking. So yeah like the others have said, do some actual learning instead of just passively absorbing.",
            "You didn't exactly give much to go off here lol\n\nHow much time a day do you dedicate to studying? You're not going to learn very fast if you're only spending 15 minutes a day for example.\n\nWhat ARE you doing for studying? Duolingo is not going to get you to fluency for example, you will need to use more pedagogically sound resources at some point, like joining a class, getting tutoring or even self-studying with a good course/textbook.\n\nAre you making sure you're using the language daily? (just being in the country is enough you actually need to put yourself in situations where you need to use it). If that's too stressful then there is a bounty of comprehensible input for both listening and reading in French online. As an English speaker it is very easy to fall back on English in most countries, because English speakers are disproportionately accommodated for.\n\n\nAlso bear in mind that a lot of immigrants learn English very quickly, because unlike native English speakers they are usually unable to fall back on their native language and are essentially *forced* to learn it. Their well-being is at stake. It's probably one of the situations people are going to learn a language the fastest.",
            "It's got to do with exposure. It's very hard to NOT have exposure to English in many countries due to the prevalence of anglophone media, like films and songs. On the flipside, it's difficult for anglophones to completely remove English from our lives, and since we can usually fall back on it, it reduces our reliance on our TL (for you, French). Meanwhile, in anglophone areas, it's almost impossible to survive without English.\n\nI've been living in a Francophone country for the past year, and have similar struggles to you, especially since many people have almost native-level English, despite never having lived in an anglophone country. While my French has definitely improved over the past year, I'm still only B2 level, despite having been learning the language for almost 15 years\n\nI'm not sure what what stage you are in your French, but I'd highly recommend looking into intesive classes if you're a beginner. Also make sure to focus on qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois media and not European French media, due to the stark accent differences",
            "1. How many **years** have you been **studying** French? French is a language. Nobody acquires a new language in a few weeks. Nobody acquires a language without studying it. \n\n\"Immersion\" (moving to a place where everyone speaks the language) doesn't make it happen faster. There are countless anecdotes about people who moved to Japan, or France, or Mexico in order to learn the language, but it didn't work.\n\nIn theory \"immersion\" would let you learn the language \"the same way that kids learn their first language\". But kids take several years, with the kid having a parent patiently teaching them the languge - basically a private tutor. Adults studying learn it faster.\n\n2. Is there a lot of anti-French sentiment in Toronto? If so, you might have picked up some of it unconsciously, and be resisting learning that \"silly parlay-voo stuff\"."
