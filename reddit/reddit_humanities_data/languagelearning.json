            "Find a podcast with a transcript, preferably for learners so the host speaks slower with more intent and start reading out loud sentence by sentence. Youre bound to start hearing the different sounds if you do it regularly enough.\n\nPeople would tell you to repeat after hearing it first but what works for me is the opposite, because I notice the mistakes I regularly make much more readily. If I listen first I repeat like a parrot, no problem, but when it comes to speaking on my own I revert right back to making mistakes and not being aware of it. When I speak first and allow myself to make mistakes, listen to the recording, re-read the sentence in the correct way, rewind and listen again to make sure, Ive noticed I root out core mistakes within 3-4 encounters with a word/sound.",
            "If you also dont hear the difference, you may want to find better examples - native English speakers from different places have different diction as well, and its not uncommon for sounds to be lost. Twenty often sounds like twunny or twenny, as an example.",

            "Thank you i will check",
            "The skill you're looking to build first before you can accurately *produce* the sounds is *hearing* the sounds as distinct from one another. This is called auditory discrimination, and it is a skill under the umbrella of phonological awareness. Because different languages contain different phonetic inventories (total number and type of sounds) it's very common to have a mismatch between the phonemes (sounds) in a target language and your first language/s. Voiceless th in particular is not a common sound worldwide, so learners of English will often substitute it with /f/, /s/, or as in your case, /t/.\n\n\nThe way I would learn auditory discrimination as an adult learner is:\n\n\n1. Look up the International Phonetic Alphabet. This shows every sound in every known language. It is useful for two reasons - a) because it is a way to visually show sounds - spelling differs from language to language, orthographic rules especially in English don't always follow one single pattern, so spelling a word or sound isn't a reliable way to know what it actually sounds like; and b) because the IPA details the place, manner and voicing of each sound, you will have an idea of *how* the sound is produced.\n\n\nLet's use the example you mentioned - the sound most often represented in English by the letters \"th\" is represented in IPA by the symbol //. Find this symbol on the IPA chart. If you look along the top of the chart, you'll see this is in the column marked \"dental\". That means the tongue is between the teeth. If you look along the left hand side, you'll see its in the row marked \"fricative\". That means it's a long sound with lots of air coming through. The fact that it is on the left hand side of a pair shows that it is voiceless - that is, your voice is \"switched off\" when you make this sound, as opposed to the voiced pair, // like in \"this\" \"those\" and \"bathe\".\nI suggest watching some YouTube videos of people reading the IPA aloud. Just know that even though it seems overwhelming to start with, almost all of the sounds in most varieties of English match up with the symbols we are used to spelling them with, and also, less than half of the sounds on the IPA chart are present in English. You got this!\n\n\n\n2. Look up the phonetic inventory of your native language, and English. See which phonemes are the same, and which are different. Which ones exist in English which don't exist in your home language? Those are the ones you'll focus on.\n\n\n3. Find English words which contain the phonemes that aren't in your native tongue. Try to say those words. Notice what sound *actually* comes out - what's the \"error\" sound? If you find this hard to judge, you might like to ask a native speaker to listen to you say the word and tell you what they hear, without showing them what word it is supposed to be.\n\n\n4. Now that you have your target sound and your error sound, find \"minimal pairs\" of these two sounds - that is, two words where the only difference is that one sound. Chat GPT is great for this, you can also try Speech Pathology resources as minimal pairs therapy is a paediatric Speech Pathologist's bread and butter. You provided a great minimal pair - faith and fate. These are also a great example of why we should rely on IPA and not spelling - although these have very different spellings, if you transcribe them into IPA you can see they have only one sound different, so they represent a minimal pair: faith /fei/ fate /feit/.\n\n\n5. Have a native speaker help you practice these minimal pairs, first receptively (they say one word and you have to point to the one you think they said), then expressively (change roles).\n\n\nIf you find production of the sound too difficult in one context, try it in different contexts. For instance, if you can't get it at the end of words (\"faith\") try it at the start of words (\"think\"). Over time it will generalise to other word positions. Good luck!\n\n\nSource: I'm a Speech Pathologist who briefly worked as an English as a Second Language teacher ",
