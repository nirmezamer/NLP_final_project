        "content": "Hey guys. My setup uses Proxmox and two Ubuntu LXCs which can access the same drive. I noticed that some of my files are not modifiable by my scripts lately and found that my one LXC can access everything and has user:users in the permissions of a file whereas my other LXC only shows nobody:nogroup is there a way that files will not change once they are touched by either of the LXC or can I add a whitelist or something? \nHelp would be greatly appreciated ",

            "Easiest would be to Just Set owner appropiately to 100000 + uid inside the unprivileged lxc.\n\nJust add such group/user in the vm as Well. You could also use usermapping for the lxc.",
            "I have read through some stuff on this topic now and from what I get this is a possibility to have a user with the same UID operating across multiple LXC/VM. Is that correct?",
            "Certainly, same uid in different systems would basically be the same user. In this case its just, that the uids of the lxc ct having another uid range (e.g. if youd change the owner to 100000 in proxmos, then inside the lxc it should be root displayed) - at least in the case of unprivileged ct's.",
            "Yes, this is what I do, I have the same user with the same uid and group in every LXC/VM, prevents any permission issues with shared files.\n\nThe nobody:nogroup I believe is because the user that made the files doesn't exist in the LXC you're looking from.",
            "Actually ITS more than that - thee uid of the owner cannot exist (w/o usermapping) bc normally the IDS would be less than 100000. Not sure, but i think those ids are mapped to -1. If IT were Just the Case that the User does Not exist then the IDS would be displayed instead of the User/group name",
            "With anything you're copying and pasting, you should spend some time googling every term you're not familiar with, this way you can adjust it to your exact setup and solve these issues.\n\nSorry I can't be more helpful than that, it's just how I approach any code blocks I find on the internet.",
            "Yes, as i said: its easier to let the lxc (User) \"own\" the storage because usermapping might be Not that easy. U need to allow root namespace via /etc/subuid (subguid), the ids in the conf must not overlap (obviously) but on the other Hand If u map one ID manually you need to map the whole ID range. There should be a debug flag for Logs when starting the ct via cli - those logs might help\n\nBy the way: If you Had a User, lets das with id 1000 in the lxc and after that do the usermapping 1000 -> 1000 then this ID (101000) does Not exist anymore. Meaning ofc you cannot Login as this User and moreover Files/folders owned by that User then are owned by \"Nobody\" and you might lose Access there",
            "I see your point. But I wanted to try the \"default\" scenario. If I start messing around prior to trying what works normally I might be the problem and I want to rule out as many factors as possible. Still you are very correct. But I am careful after having lost my data once. This might be a good moment to say I do have backups now",
            "There is no \"default\" is my point. For that you would have to be starting from scratch everytime.\nBy knowing what you're doing at each step you can also understand what you're starting with when you try to do something else.",
            "Depends if your lxc is privileged or unprivileged. In both cases, permissions must match between hosts accessing the directory.\n\nIn a privileged lxc, uid/gid simply has to match what's on the host and ownership of the bind map directory. If you have a plex user with uid/gid of 1003 running the plex service, that user must also exist on the host and have ownership of the bind mount directory.\n\nSame scenario with unprivileged, but there additional uid/gid mapping between host and lxc. The proxmox wiki entry for \"unprivileged lxc\" has a basic run down of the settings needed and the mapping syntax. Stephane Graber's blog also has an entry from way back on this that goes a bit deeper. It's still valid, the mapping hasn't changed since he wrote it.\n\nThe whole mapping thing is handled a bit differently in Incus, but the underlying principles are the same."

It has no idea what's actually connected to it.\n\nAre you saying the devices plugged into the switch have no network?\n\nAnd by network do you mean internet connection? Or connection to your LAN?\n\nIs it possible when you connect to the AP you're getting internet but not LAN?\n\nWhat is the AP connected to to get its internet connection? Is there another device somewhere here you haven't mentioned?",
            "Thank you for your answer.\n\nThe devices plugged into the switch have no connection to the LAN.\n\nI want to connect my physical LAN output to the switch, and connect the AP to this switch.\n\nThe AP would therefore have the connection to the LAN and the internet.",
