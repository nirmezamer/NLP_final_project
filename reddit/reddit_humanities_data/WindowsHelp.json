        "content": "Welcome to /r/WindowsHelp, the subreddit for you to ask questions and get support for issues related to Microsoft's Windows family of operating systems. Please give this a quick read before posting.\n\nThis subreddit is only for help related to Microsoft Windows and its built in software, like Edge, Store, PowerShell, and so on. Issues about 3rd party software like Chrome or Steam should be posted in their subreddits or /r/techsupport. Also, this is not a hardware subreddit, so issues like your hard drive is not detected would need to be posted in /r/techsupport. General discussions, news, artwork, and so on should be in /r/Windows, /r/Windows10 or similar subreddits. Malware/virus removal has been covered extensively in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide/\n\nPosts are required to have a moderately descriptive title. Submissions with vague titles like just \"help me\" will be removed. You don't need to write an essay in the title, but everyone should have a rough idea what you are asking about before even clicking the link. Titles like \"I'm encountering System Exception errors when launching Photos\" or \"20H2 update won't install\" are acceptable, but the more details the better. \n\nThe body of your post should also be as detailed as possible. We are not mind readers, and nobody is going to want to play 20 questions. Help us help you, your post should include:\n\n* Your full Windows version, which on Windows 10 is listed in the Settings app under System -> About, it will be the OS Build number.\n\t\n* Details about your device, like the hardware specifications.  \n\t\n* Any recent changes you have made, such as installing/uninstalling software or accessories. Any updates you have installed, tools you have ran, or anything else you think may be relevant.\n\t\n* Include details on your error messages and error codes, these are critical to figuring out the issue.\n\t\n* Tell us what you have already tried to fix this. Any tools you have ran, and changes you tried, and so on. I know it is a meme at this point, but seriously, reboot your computer, it often fixes things!\n\t\n* If possible, include screenshots or video. If you are including screenshots, try to use screenshot software like Snip & Sketch tool built into Windows 10, then you can upload them to a free image host like https://imgur.com to put in your post. We understand that using screenshot software isn't always an option, you can take photos with a phone or similar device, but please be sure to check to make sure everything is in focus and is legible. \n\t\n\nThis subreddit follows the same rules as /r/Windows, you can view the full rule page here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules\n\nThe TL;DR of the rules is be polite, helpful, and don't encourage piracy.",

I use a windows 10 HP laptop and haven't updated to the windows 11 software yet. It was fine moments prior and it did not have this annoying pop-up whenever I turned my caps on and off, but now that I've resetted it's been doing it and I don't like it. I can't find any info on how to turn it off either, It's just really bugging me out and super duper annoying. Does anyone know why this happening? Or maybe a solution how to fix it / turn it off?",

            "This is not an OSD from Windows 11, but one added by some HP software/driver. I don't know for sure how to completely disable it, but you may be able to do so, by going in the startup tab of Task manager (Ctrl+ alt + esc) and disabling entries with \"hotkey\", \"on screen display\", \"osd\" etc.",

When it happened to me I just used the Advanced Startup Repair where I could just reset the whole pc, and that was an easy fix. But now the same thing happened again but when i go to the Advanced Startup  Repair the rest button does not show. I have also tried the diskpart command where you clean disk 0 and then just boot with windows on a usb but it just doesnt work, when I do the \"list disk\" command it tells me \"There are no fixed disk to show\" and I just dont know whats wrong I have tried a ton of other stuff but its just not working, and I am also a standard user on my laptop so I cant do alot of things such as uninstall the display drivers to try and reinstall or I cant change the boot order because I also do not know the Admin Password on my laptop. Please someone help its been like this for about 4 days now and I am just very tired and desperate for a solution.\n\nLaptop - Dell Latitude 3140\n\nRunning Windows 10 Education 64x",

I recommend going to your school's IT helpdesk and getting assistance, they will have all the tools to be able to resolve the issues, including resetting the PC if necessary. If it is locked down the same way I did it when I was a school admin, there won't be anything you can realistically do.",
