            "Any recommendation of supernatural horror movie from middle east? I've already watched Under The Shadow, Dhabbe, Siccin.",
            "I watched Arcadia this week. Really enjoyed it, the monster design was really unique and creepy.\n\nAlso watched I Saw the TV Glow. I thought this was going to be more of a horror film than it is, it's really more of an artsy indie vibe exploring escapism and sexuality/gender dysphoria. Not particularly suspenseful but it is a great movie nonetheless.",
            "I saw infested a few days ago, it\u2019s about spiders taking over an apartment building. Honestly pretty solid movie 8.5/10",
            "The Outwaters - this is a found footag Blair Witch wanna be. A group of young folk go out into the desert and cosmic horror strikes. Watchable but weird pacing and barely a story.",
            "I just finished The Witch with Anya Taylor-Joy. Really enjoyed it! Much better than I expected, actually.",
            "I rewatched Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3. Part 2 has the best character of the series: Ginny, and I do wish that she appeared again. The rest of the film is pretty good, but standard. Part 3 I felt nothing, but it was pretty funny to see how cliched the film is. It is ultimately boring tho, which I knew going in, but people convinced me to watch it \"because it has the best final chase in the franchise\". It did not have the best final chase in the franchise.",
            "Anyone else watching the new British series, *Insomnia*? It was slow at first, but now I'm glad I stuck with it.\u00a0\n\n\nSynopsis:\n>Successful career woman Emma Averill fears that she is losing her mind as her hard-won lifelong dream begins to turn into a nightmare, forcing her to do everything she can to prevent it from collapsing around her.",
            "I watched Saw X and I somehow had high expectations, but more surprisingly it didn't disappoint. Tobin Bell was on screen most of the movie and that's probably the main reason. Minor gripes with minor spoilers:\n\n>!The villains would have been better off getting real jobs. For the amount of effort and the risk, plus the damage they were causing people, it was hard to believe that their scam could have been profitable enough to be worth it. Towards the end the main lady says that she's happy she won't have to split the cash now, she's got a bag of money and it would seem she never paid her associates. I was annoyed that she got the easiest game even though she was the mastermind of the scam.!<",
            "Be My Cat: A Film for Anne - really liked this. Small budget, docu style \"filmed\" by the main character. The writer/director is working on a trilogy and I look forward to watching those. It's just a fun time.\n\nGreat rec if you like Creep (the one with the videographer, not the subway one).",
            "I just watched a found footage movie called the butterfly kisses and I must say my mind was blown. A fairly unique concept around the whole premise of the found footage genre, and with the ambiguity and confusion created to divert the audience is great in the movie and the ending was well done too. Overall a soldi 9/10"

            "I watched this a few days before release on Scream Unseen. It started promising but they really did drop the ball in the third act.",
            "Russell Crowe in another exorcism movie? Didn't I just see him on a vespa?",
            "This wasn't very good. Some story elements had potential, but the script never came together in a cohesive way. There was no tension to keep my attention. The actors did their best, but it wasn't enough to salvage this from being a slog. I'd reccommend skipping this one.",
            "This movie made 0 effort to tie anything together cohesively but had a few fun moments. It was not as bad as people are making it out to be if you can turn your brain off during it. The writer wanted to make a movie about alcoholism and used the demon possession stuff to represent how suppressing your feelings and trauma can affect the people around you. Predictable horror movie but worth a watch if you're bored.",
            "I thought the first half of the film was excellent. It wasn't clear what was going to happen, but it was genuinely scary for awhile (although it relied a bit more on jump scares and loud noises than I like). The music was really solid.\n\nI think leaning into the struggling alcoholic trope gave it a cool The Shining sort of vibe. I also liked the meta plot pointing at The Exorcist, which reminded me of Wes Craven's New Nightmare (which I thought was actually pretty scary, for a Nightmare on Elm Street movie).\n\nUnfortunately the plot didn't really pay off or go anywhere interesting. >!The characters didn't react to absurd situations in ways that made any sense (Russell Crowe bent over backwards in an impossible way and smashed his face into a table, then murdered someone, and they...sent him home with his teenager daughter?). I still don't understand the childhood trauma that happened to Russell Crowe either.!<\n\nStill better than The Pope's Exorcist.",
            "Pretty large pile of shit. \n\nLove some schlocky Russell Crowe (See The Pope's Exorcist or Land of Bad) but this was basically irredeemable, some baffling directing choices, very little actual horror. David Hyde Pierce is solid at least and the premise of Crowe's character is interesting but doesn't really pay off in a meaningful way. \n\n1.5/5",
            "I didn't realize that the director is Jason Miller's son (and Jason Patric's half brother).  That makes it a more interesting idea.",
            "It's been a while since I've seen a film this dull. Or this dark. Not in terms of tone. Just in terms of lighting. It's got a dark tone too. I think. Hard to tell. Couldn't really see what was happening on screen about 60% of the time. \n\nI want to blame it being so dull on the fact that it was just being a string of clich\u00e9s but I don't think that's the root cause. I mean, that's true-- this is a fully derivative film in every respect-- but so are lots of things and they're not as big of a drag as this film is. Scientists should study this, because it really was so dull that it almost crossed the line into being fascinatingly experimental in how phoned in and bland something could be and still technically qualify as a \"film\"... but then... it didn't.\n\nI wish the power of Christ had compelled the writer/director/producers to do something more interesting than this.",
            "Why did the priest sacrifice himself at the end?\n\nAnd who did Adrian Pasdar play?",
            "I love Russell Crowe movies, but this was pretty bad. A lot of the scenes\u00a0tried building tension, but almost every one of them just went on way too long and delivered little payoff.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPlus, while the ideas might have been interesting (filming an exorcist horror movie, main lead getting abused/molested[?] in childhood and consequently struggling to face that trauma while filming), the execution of making them into a cohesive plot felt incredibly disjointed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso, Sam Worthington and Adam Goldberg were insanely underutilized throughout the whole movie. I especially would have loved to see Goldberg\u2019s dickhead producer character get a deserved comeuppance for constantly berating Crowe\u2019s character. \u00a0\n\n2/10.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If I wanted to watch a demonically-belligerent Russell Crowe, I would have watched him sailing around the world on a tugboat finding cancer-ridden children to fight."

I thought it was a good movie, it felt like horror should feel to me.",
            "One of favorites! I first saw it a few years ago during the rona lockdowns, and it was one of the only movies to actually *scare me* in years, and my oft-horror-hating partner loved it. I love how it takes place in a single location and how much spookiness is conveyed by the actress' facial expressions and body manipulations. Plus Emile Hirsch is *so* good. I wish he'd do more horror! Just an awesome movie, glad it has been getting the love it deserves the last few years.",
            "This is actually one of my favourite recent horror films. I think it was beautifully executed and had me in a chokehold throughout the whole film. The atmosphere is so uncomfortable and tense. It was one of those few movies that didn't leave me with a \"Meh, was alright\" but a \"Woah, that was great\". Shame you didn't enjoy it as much :("

A drama or romance etc generally have like 2 or 3 ways they\u2019ll \u201cplay out\u201d once you hit Act 2.\n\nA horror movie may not even really show you what is going on until the end of Act 2.  It may change protagonists, it may change location abruptly and other options that typical genre films don\u2019t have\n\nIt\u2019s the unique aspect of horror that gets me to watch more of it than other genres\n\nThen if it manages to be truly unsettling or crazy, then, awesome.

He said the buildup is the same - you do the setup, and then subvert expectations. I thought that was so interesting. I want to be surprised. \n\nI agree with another poster, romance especially is so formulaic, I find it generally boring. I sometimes like drama, but usually I don\u2019t want to feel my heart hurting from sadness because of what I\u2019m watching. \n\nObviously, especially lately, there\u2019s been more horror that digs into trauma and tragedy (Ari Aster for one), and I do enjoy those movies but I still mostly want to enjoy horror movies to be scared. I can be fully engrossed (hard to be half paying attention to horror), have some fun, be surprised if I\u2019m lucky, and hopefully not get my heart beaten to a pulp.\n\nEdit: sorry, I thought it was OP who talked about other genres and their formulas.",
