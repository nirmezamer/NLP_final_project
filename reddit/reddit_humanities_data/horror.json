            "Just saw a screening of it. Was pretty good and self-contained. It added just a bit more lore to the monsters themselves. Was fun throughout!  Only thing more unrealistic about the movie than aliens from outer space, was just how quiet the cat was. My cat would have gotten me killed within the hour.",
            "They added a sprinkle of lore about the aliens. Was hoping for more.\n\nHoping the video game adds more",
            "Loved the movie and cried at the end but did anyone else wish they had subtitles when they were whispering? With Erics accent during the rain scene it was so loud I couldnt hear what he said lol",
            "I thought it was a well done movie. I think New York would look like this one day after an invasion. Scenes have a lot of tension, but did not care about the jump scare. Sam and Eric have a lot of chemistry and the cat is cute.\n\nThe only thing I didnt understand is what is wrong with Sam? What disease does she have?",
            "this had me wondering who'd win between a xenomorph and a quiet place alien. do we have an official term for them?",
            "I couldnt help but be distracted at the cat being barely  wet after being submerged in water TWICE",
            "I really enjoyed it. I didnt see a ton of trailers or reviews so was pleasantly surprised that they did a good job of amping up the aliens while also still having the heart of the first one. Probably not for everybody but I hope it makes a good chunk of change.",
            "I was surprised by how much I liked this.  I've not seen the other films and am not a fan of apocalyptic horror in general, but the theater had AC, so...  Great performances all around -- especially from Lupita Nyong'o, Joseph Quinn, and the cats (Schnitzel and Nico ) -- and a lot of heartfelt moments that had me tearing up a little.  The scenes with the creatures were the parts I liked least, though, so I think it falls a little short on the horror front.",
            "Ngl, I kind of wished the entire movie took place from the perspective of animals/the main cat. That would've been soooo cool. Almost like a horror Homeward Bound."

I work in the environmental field, and people like Tredwell who romanticize nature do just as much destruction because they encourage this sorta stuff. I feel angrier about that Into The Wild movie though. A lot of people went out and died trying to find that stupid bus.",

            "It's because not only the dead are odd people, also the living ones in the doc are very unsettling too. The coroner and the director creeper me out so much."
