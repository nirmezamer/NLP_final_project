Could be either side but I would check on both, quick way to do it is jack your car up on either side and try to wiggle your tire back and forth side to side. Will give you an idea if it is traveling because of the bearing or even another steering component. But yeah man, thats your wheel bearing and hub assembly",

It\u2019s 1am where I am and she just called me because her car is doing something silly and we\u2019re obviously concerned and since we can\u2019t get help tonight I figured maybe someone on reddit could give some insight lol. \n\nThe vehicle in question is a 2008 Pontiac g5.\n\nI\u2019ve attached videos but the battery seems to be smoking and then underneath the car it looks to be leaking/smoking. She\u2019s left the car where it is and plans to get it towed but is this simply an old battery trying to kill itself off in the worst way, or potentially something a lot worse? The battery is over 8 years old. She said it starts normally for what it\u2019s worth. Nothing else seems to be weird aside from the obvious. \n\nAgain, sorry for my ignorance. I know nothing about cars and she\u2019s stressed and lives no where near me to help.",

            "Okay so when the battery smells like asshole or rotten eggs thats sulfur from the battery boiling. Usually means that way too much current is being dumped into it. Usually means the alternator voltage regulator is bad and its pumping out way too much current. You have to decide after you taking it in or finding yourself?\n\nYour battery will need to be replaced. To test the alternator use a volt meter on the battery posts. Car of it should float around 12.5-13v. Engine running battery charged maybe 13.4-13.8. If you see anything over 14.2 and I expect like 15 volt and up, thats it and swap out the alternator.",

            "Disconnect it and wash ur hands",
            "That drain hose looks messed up at the connection to battery. Cut and reconnect if you have the excess. The battery is fucked most likely because the alternator is fucked. Stay away as the vapor from that is explosive...... I didn't know that until I blew up a battery when charging it. Saw the smoke. Disconnected the charger. Spark happened and boom. I stood the astonished..... that it didn't get me.",
            "There are two possibilities one your alternators overcharging the battery shoving too much of voltage into it the liquid to boil over the other possibility could be that you got a dead cell which means you need to replace the battery which is also causing it to boil over as well.",
            "It could explode if overheated too much and battery acid ruins everything",
            "Thank you for the insight! I know my dads going to look at it tomorrow because hes also suspecting the alternator. Hes no mechanic though so hes just going to do what dads do and probably take it to one regardless \n\nQuick question. Is the battery okay left connected right now? The car is off but she said she left the battery connected as she didnt know how to disconnect it so its just chilling as is in a parking lot.",
            "Thats what I told her . She realized after she already touched it that it was probably a bad idea lol",

They were able to fix a brake problem at the time of the inspection and presented me a list of problems. Overally, I was pleased with the visit. At the top of the list were spark plugs and accessory belt, so I just replaced those myself in a few hours and saved $300.  If I were to bring back my car for some of other items on the list, would they be pissed that they lost out on the work?

            "Yep, but you should take it to the dealer to see if there is emissions coverage on the filler neck. Federal emissions warranty is 7yr/70k.\nSerious issues can happen on newer cars, I put an engine in a brand new sprinter because it was knocking on pdi, another tech put a transmission in a gls because it grenaded at like 700mi. Toyota is having oiling issues on the new tundra's, Honda has random issues mostly with new model releases though. When my mother bought her Highlander in 22' I made her get the extended warranty because I didn't want to deal with fixing it and I figured if something goes wrong and is covered then it's worth the cost of the warranty. I tell my sprinter clients all the time to get it. Even if it is only used a handful of times it is worth the cost. when my fiancee gets a new car I'm getting the extended warranty for it because I don't want to deal with non-wear and tear costs on newer cars.",
