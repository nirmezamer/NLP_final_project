I thought it was the left wheel but i couldnt find anything so i check the right and it looks like a have some wobble. I had my truck packed with furniture i was moving trying to beat the rain so i drove 40 mins with the bad grinding sound. I live in the sticks on the side of a mountain, no one will deliver parts and there is no uber, i just moved here and don\u2019t know anyone to ask for a ride. Part store is 40 mins away can i make it? I can change in the parking lot of the parts store if i have to",

When we finally heard from them they said they had discovered it was the heater core and they had gone ahead and bypassed it (no they did not ask if we wanted them to do that or provide an estimate prior to doing it), and that it would be $750. The guy says it is a little more than $200 for parts, and 3 1/2 hours for diagnostics and labor. \n\nCan someone just let me know if this is possibly reasonable?

I told them if the bogus charges didnt get removed, my next call was to the DA, and then the police if they didn't give me my car back immediately.\n\nThe asshole manager realized he wasnt dealing with some naive kid and backed down.  They removed the charges, and the tires they installed without permission.  I still reported them for fraud.  They ended up getting fined after a lengthy investigation due to all kinds of other complaints.
