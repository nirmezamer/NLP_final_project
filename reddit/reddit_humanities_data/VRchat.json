            "I've noticed a lot of my friends met through gaming worlds tend start up relaxing/sleeping worlds in a Friends+ instance and chill by themselves. Is there a reason why people don't just do a private invite instance? I imagine it'd be rude to hop in with someone while they're trying to sleep, or is there some sort of expectation?",
            "I just started playing the game on quest 2, however I noticed the game had slight performance issues during some situations. I was going to install vrchat on my PC since it's more than capable of handling that. I'm just wondering if there's a way to link my oculus/meta account to my steam account so all my stuff transfers over but I still get to use the power of my pc (while using my headset)",
            "Does the new SDK ignore leaf bones? I had a model with 155 bones as a .blend and there are _end bones, like at least 5, and so I exported a .fbx file without leaf bones, and the bones count is STILL 155",

            "Hey, most people just called me lucky or punk either is fine with me. Im 22 and looking to make some friends in vrc. Probably an easy guess I'm a punk and love punk music and other alternative genres so music is an easy one to break the ice with. Im pretty laid back, sometimes a little quiet but I like to be around people, at least in vrc. I really like video games and reading too so that's always cool. I'm not really looking for any huge groups, just a few laid back people who like to just hang out. I enjoy cozy or lazy type worlds like tbe soft space series. I get along with most people, LGBT is always welcome, you won't find any judgement from me  ping me back if you'd like to hang out sometime :)",

Im willing to play all roles at once (just using different characters) or I can play just one, so it doesnt matter to me! Just bear in mind, my characters models are all based off of the sun and moon from fnaf! alternatively! if your in the SaMS fandom, thats awesome too!!",
