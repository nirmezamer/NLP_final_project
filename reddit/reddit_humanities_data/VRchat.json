We do classes of social anxiety and we do paired talking for practice with the occasional pop-up event. We help people with social anxiety who want to push themselves to practice talking one on one and in groups. We encourage them to go out and join other communities so they can find a place they feel most belonged in.\n\nWe also developed people who want to use their social skills to help others connect around them. We encourage people to invite others into their space. Learn some of the skills for what it means to be a community builder so one day they can leave to help another group or make their own. \n\nSo if you are curious about managing your social anxiety or community building you can go to our discord https://discord.com/invite/ZAevjk3sZm",
