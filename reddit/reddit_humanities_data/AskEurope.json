            "I think one of the most difficult things about creative writing is judging how much to show and how much to tell. Too much telling \"he was angry\" can make the writing less engaging, because it reduces the reader's participation in creating the story. But too much showing can grind the pacing \"his face grew red, his eyes narrowed and veins throbbed as his hands curled into a white-knuckled fist\". Then again, this is also a simplified way of looking at it.\n\nMy favorite writers are those that manage to pack a lot of content in a few words. You know, when you read something and think that the author has crystallized the writing to its most perfect form, where not a word more or less is necessary. I think rather than getting too hung up on how much to show and how much to tell, it is better to think of how to best tell this story as a whole so that when the reader finishes it, he thinks it was just... right (and possibly is left wanting just a little more).\n\nIt is the same when it comes to open/ambiguous endings. It is hard to balance just exactly what ends to tie and which ones to leave to the imagination. If the balance is off, the reader may either think that you just couldn't figure it out and it's unsatisfying, or again, if you just tie off everything, you leave nothing to imagination. \n\nIn any case, I should read more fiction again, but most of my to be read list at the moment is non-fiction... \n\nWhat about you guys? Do you enjoy a variety of writing styles? Or is there something you particularly like/dislike?",

        "content": "In Sweden, people (in my opinion) overhype the \"Swedish strawberries\", only in season for a couple months every year. They're praised as superior in taste to any other strawberry. To me, it's obviously because they're freshly picked and ripened before picking, being sold shortly thereafter, not because they're specifically Swedish.\n\nCompared to the Dutch indoor berries or the Spanish berries shipped for days, of course they taste better. Because they are fresh and sun ripened. But this wouldn't differ for any other country, any freshly picked berries would surely be delicious?\n\nHowever, this strawberry nationalist mentality persists.\n\nSo my question is, does your country hype your local berries the same way as here?",

They're in peak season right now (strawberries that is, rhubarb season is April/May) and people go crazy for them. Anywhere rural will have PYO (pick your own) strawberry farms where you can go and pick them fresh filling your own punnett, buying them from farms, or just getting them from the supermarket. Strawberries and Cream is the traditional dish of Wimbledon which starts next week.\n\nI wouldn't say there's a nationalist vibe to it, I've never heard anyone say British strawberries are better than anywhere else, but I'd say it's one of the few foods where people still understand that being naturally in season and fresh gives you the best version.",

            "It's the same with all local food here. Local weather, soil and varieties that are grown are important for taste, just like with any food. It's also true that imported fruit and vegetables usually have to be picked unripe and refrigerated for a longer time, which makes them taste bland in comparison to local produce. And I guess there's the nostalgia factor too. Many of us have beloved childhood memories of eating fresh produce from the family garden or local farm, and there's always a part of us that wants to experience this again.",

That's it the only imported vegetable I know), we usually eat locally and people are very picky with their fruit and vegetables. But the strawberries from certain regions are definitely sought after and praised. Where I come from, there's a type of sweet, fragrant, pink strawberry that has a very short season and people are after them like swarms of locusts. \n\nIt's not just strawberries, though. Grapes from this region, melon from that place, tomatoes from this city can be famous and locals take pride in them.",
            "While I agree that freshly picked berries obviously taste better than imported ones and that is part of the reason people hype local produce, I also think there's some truth to Swedish strawberries tasting better than say Spanish ones. Not because they're Swedish, but because they're grown further north in a colder climate. Berries take longer to ripen here, which means they have more time to develop more taste. I think of it like cooking/baking something at a very high temperature at a high speed vs slow cooking something for hours and hours. The slow cooking food is going to have a richer taste."
