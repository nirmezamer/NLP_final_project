            "I don't know much about the etiquette of online play so if someone could enlighten me as to why \"ki charging\" makes people so upset? Sorry if this has been asked before. \\^\\_\\^;;;",
            "Not a question, but I can understand if it\u2019s best not suited here but I sincerely want to say how for all personal life pressures and current countdown until rolling out to work that * this Reddit has made for some of the most casual fun I\u2019ve had on this platform * even if it\u2019s not being the fun \u2018sunshine\u2019 poking through the monotonous clouds of Reddit postings on the c\u2014y sociopolitical deterioration, demise ad despair of the world. \n\nI was too nervous but to post this even as a fluff posting which might throw off the \u2018theme of Tekken fun\u2019 but thank you all ! ^_^ .",
            "Got the game. Played through arcade quest, all the character episodes, main story, picked a main, and spent a few hours reading up/learning basic moves.\n\nCurrently at 0-10 in ranked, hoping to get to 0-100 if I really stick at the grind, wish me luck.",
            "Dear diary I punished with EWGF on wifi",
            "Just wanna say, my game black-screened after \"pressing any button\" on a title screen fight that happened because I didn't do anything after the intro movie played. But the song is soo fucking fire!\n\nI'm also tripping balls right now. Hehe\n\nGlad I finally decided to search for a tekken sub! I have tons of questions on how to get better. Been playing since I was 5 years, I'm 32 now. Man, time is a bitch. Booting up Tekken 7 for the first time on PS5. \n\nI've watched a lot of videos and they've used abbreviations for square and triangle (triangles seem like the sub meta rn lol) etc., and a lot of the movements such as the Korean backdash seem a little intimidating, but I'm always up for a challenge. Before we could afford/my Parents even thought we would need internet; I thought I was hot shit for knowing a 10 hit or two! Lmao. Seeing what some people have elevated this game to is amazing!\n\nI have taken far too much of your/my time to read/type this so, much love guys!",
            "how come there wasnt a thread about red bull golden letters event? it was pretty hype but i see 0 discussion about it",
            "I don't want to make a whole post because I feel it's a waste of space but holy fuck I'm so hyped. New to the franchise and I just hit red with Lee. You all told me to pick a character I thought was cool, so I did, and then proceeded to hop on the fucking struggle bus for 2 months and nearly 700 matches. Nowhere to go but up but man I am so fucking pumped.",
            "If I block Julia's df2,1 leaving me +18, and it takes 11 frames for my WGF to come out, does that mean I have only a 7 frame long window to input for a punish?",
            "Hello guys! I have been playing tekken for a while. I use a Ps4 controller and I have a question: Right now I play with this layout:\n\n\\- R1: 2+4\n\n\\- R2: 1+2\n\n\\- L1: 1+3\n\n\\- L2: 3+4\n\n\\- L3: 1+4\n\n\\- R3: 2+3  \n\n\nThis layout has been very good for me, but I have a problem when doing the 1 + 4 buttons, I grab the controller normal, not claw grip or anything, just normal, like playing any other game. The problem is that I actually do not use the L3 (1+4) because it feels weird and I actually go faster by switching to claw grip for a second to press those 2 buttons, but still I think that is a little bit slow. Any suggestions about this? I play mainly King, I need 1+4 for example for the first part of the rolling death craddle.",
            "How do I deal with fighting a character ive never seen before or maybe only once in a hundred games? I just got my 100th win on Steve and my next game was against an Eliza. Needless to say I lost badly barely understood what she was even doing then they denied the rematch. Do I just ignore the rarer match ups? Accept that once in a hundred games I just have to lose to an Eliza or Ganryu? Or is there some \"trick\" to dealing with matchups you dont know and are unlikely to ever face often. I mean it can be hard enough to simply understand what to do against King not mention the other 50 people doing god knows what. Thanks."
