            "I don't know much about the etiquette of online play so if someone could enlighten me as to why \"ki charging\" makes people so upset? Sorry if this has been asked before. \\^\\_\\^;;;",

            "Got the game. Played through arcade quest, all the character episodes, main story, picked a main, and spent a few hours reading up/learning basic moves.\n\nCurrently at 0-10 in ranked, hoping to get to 0-100 if I really stick at the grind, wish me luck.",

            "I don't want to make a whole post because I feel it's a waste of space but holy fuck I'm so hyped. New to the franchise and I just hit red with Lee. You all told me to pick a character I thought was cool, so I did, and then proceeded to hop on the fucking struggle bus for 2 months and nearly 700 matches. Nowhere to go but up but man I am so fucking pumped.",
            "If I block Julia's df2,1 leaving me +18, and it takes 11 frames for my WGF to come out, does that mean I have only a 7 frame long window to input for a punish?",
            "How do I deal with fighting a character ive never seen before or maybe only once in a hundred games? I just got my 100th win on Steve and my next game was against an Eliza. Needless to say I lost badly barely understood what she was even doing then they denied the rematch. Do I just ignore the rarer match ups? Accept that once in a hundred games I just have to lose to an Eliza or Ganryu? Or is there some \"trick\" to dealing with matchups you dont know and are unlikely to ever face often. I mean it can be hard enough to simply understand what to do against King not mention the other 50 people doing god knows what. Thanks.",
            "is there a way to stop king from moving so much while customizing? it makes me kinda dizzy",
            "I want to start labbing properly. Do i need to purchase the \"TEKKEN 7 - DLC13: Frame Data Display\"? Or are there any mods that can replace it"

            "in the 2010 movie Kazuya bangs both Anna and Nina at the same time.\n\nI'm sorry I dredged up the memory of that movie in the heads of everyone who saw it, I just find it fascinating how the sisters were basically there to just be pieces of ass for Kazuya x'D",

            "I really wish Anna was the one working for Kazuya in T8, instead of Nina :') I think they, like, have an actual appreciation for each other and enjoy each other's company, so it would've been nice to see some fun/interesting interactions between them throughout Story Mode, as opposed to what we got w Nina and Kazuya which was very much 'Right, down to business, hello and goodbye'.\n\nI really think Anna could've worked so well being incorporated into the base game plotline :') Nina could've also then worked for Jin and co. because she's worked w Jin before, and Lee and Nina having a special intro would make more sense because right now that little side story or w/e lowkey feels tacked on, like I don't think she even takes Lee's request in the canon timeline so what was even the point  It's cool and all but imo it would've made more sense for Lee's other intro to be, idk, Alisa or Kazuya or smth (at least he gets special dialogue w Kazuya ig :'D). But yeah anyway I think Anna would've fit right into the plotline and it would've been neat to draw back on her and Kazuya's history, and would've been a good way to bring the Williams sisters' plotline back, but ah well :'D"
