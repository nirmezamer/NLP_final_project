            "Just a heads up - the start of the game is meant to be English audio so don't restart the game even if you are unsure you chose Japanese dub",

            "It sucks that both dubs are flawed in different ways:\n\nJapanese is overall better, but it's pretty obvious that when characters speak English (even if they're not Japanese) the actors are clearly Japanese and/or non native speakers first, even if the character is a white guy. Eric is also odd, for someone who grew up in America he sure does sound like a Japanese person who learned English as an adult. \n\nPlus Danny Trejo not voicing Danny Trejo is just incredibly weird. I feel like Sega Japan and America should have combined their work and had the English dub voices for when people speak English, like they did with that Kson girl, or otherwise cast English actors who could realistically sound like the Japanese ones to switch between. \n\nOr hell, just pull a Tekken and have everyone speak their native language and somehow everyone knows what everyone else is saying.",
            "Just want to share some easily missed small details in post-game: >!(Canonically or not) If you wait a bit in Survive Bar and pay some attention to speech bubbles, Ichiban and Saeko apparently reconciled thanks to Adachi, Saeko still despises 'that' shirt and they're planning their dates etc. !<",
            "Combat being x10 better due to positioning mattering with colleteral/enviormental dmg and having movement really makes the gameplay loop infintelty more fluid and strategic,\u00a0 perfect guard still an thing that feels interactive and keeps you from falling alseep\u00a0\n\n\nTraversal through rechargable mini scooter is also amazing, man in having an blast so far\u00a0",
