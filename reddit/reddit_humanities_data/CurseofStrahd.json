We can assume the part that got laid over Barovia was the Pine forest portion.\n\nWe also know that from [this post on the forgotten realsm wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Barovia#Flora_&_Fauna) that the majority of trees in the lowlands were hardwood trees, such as\u00a0[beech](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beech),\u00a0[cherry](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cherry),\u00a0hazelnut, and\u00a0[oak](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Oak), and at the higher elevations they were evergreens, such as\u00a0[fir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fir),\u00a0[pine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pine), and\u00a0[spruce](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spruce).\n\nKnowing that the Svalich wood were entirely old growth Beech Firs, the question is, what trees made up the other forests?\n\nPlease discuss and help me with this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fqgb8vegi9d1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f143c40c675cd7f3f67ec19f09f3b13a6f1ef7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9oskabdgi9d1.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=88625c5328dc8c55a3fbd2e24e58135b8750ffd4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqbekbbdgi9d1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=79b46b0f65aa390f78dd7df8aedbb0936eb6df7e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9h6epcbdgi9d1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2266b02964de85ade3d4f4a33bab69817e3f064\n\n",

            "Thank you, it\u2019s likely why they went the route of just having all forests called the Scalich woods but when I first started finding out about specific regions of Barovia it didn\u2019t make sense and when I learned that there were other names for specific forests I knew there had to be a difference between them.",
            "To be honest this is the type of stuff ive been doing for my curse of strahd session i plan to run maybe later in the year.i did research on beverages,timeline, and even background for certain characters that arent fleshed out in the OG book.I was actually curious what kind of herbs fungus and wood variants would grow in Barovia but havent gotten to that yet.This post gave me some good ideas.",

            "Maybe, since the horses can\u2019t be controlled by anyone other than Strahd and the carriage requires no driver (though Rahadin might sit in the driver\u2019s seat for appearances), the carriage is magical and the horses just materialize and take shape from the mists in the courtyard of Ravenloft whenever Strahd wishes to use the carriage. It\u2019s cleaner than cluttering the courtyard with a real stables, or thinking about how Strahd keeps real horses fed and protected from Barovia\u2019s many predators.",
            "I added a stable in the back corner of the servant courtyard and made a stable hand NPC. The vistani visit the castle often enough that there would be need for shelter for their mounts. \n\nYou could just have this in the carriage house instead.",
            "My assumption is that they are some sort of summonable horses. Rahadin can summon a phantom horse, so I figured it's some unexplained magic like that. But the module doesn't make it clear.\n\nWhen my player's characters arrived at the castle in the carriage, I had Rahadin escort the horses off to another part of the courtyard out of sight and handwaved it. But I'd probably make it an enchanted carriage situation if it came down to it.",
            "There's already locations for live horses to be stabled.  If you want methods on things like how they're fed and watered then there's great plots to be made concerning the wizards winery being the only real \"farm\" area, or the people in Krezk doing double time to produce food, or taking the water from the fountain because Strahd \"only accepts the best\".  Catching shipping lanes heading to Ravenloft could be an awesome travel encounter.\n\nIf you don't want the horses to be too distracting then just make them phantom steeds that can be summoned (or more importantly unsummoned) like Ezmerelda's cart.",

            "I mean.....why would he need non-Beucephalus horses? Any carriage that picks the party up I would assume to be spooky and ghostly. \n\nTo amp up some horror, you could add a stables where the corpses of horses remain, maybe even implying the horses pulling the carriage are ghosts? \n\nIdk, that's just me, you can also add horsemanship to poor Cyrus's chore list \ud83d\ude02, and that stable would definitely be in the courtyard."
