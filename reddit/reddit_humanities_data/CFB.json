Unfortunately FOX having multiple premium picks to throw it at noon lowers that chance.\n\nWish we made that one of our \"tolerances\" the big boys of the conference get, maybe trade it in exchange FOX gets one of our home games to put on Friday night.",

            ">So my plea to you, Fox executives: If deviating from the noon window is a bridge too far for you, do us all the favor and pick Oregon vs Michigan now. You\u2019re sure to get enough eyeballs on that game to \u201cwin the window\u201d just the same. And we, the people who still care enough about our traditions, get to keep what makes the Whiteout special.\n\n>Isn\u2019t that why Oregon, Washington, USC, and UCLA are members of the Big Ten now? So you can showcase them? So Fox, do us all a solid, and showcase them, if you\u2019re not going to play showcase the Whiteout at night.\n\nTotally agree that Oregon vs Michigan is the much better game and should get the noon slot. \n\nI mean... only a bunch of sickos would want to see Ohio State beat a team that they have won 11 of the last 12 against including 7 in a row.",
