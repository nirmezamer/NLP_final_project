My job has a leaderboard for who grabs the most tickets , we\u2019re not graded on it but we do get a reward for 1st and 2nd place quarterly , which is a nice little motivation plus it\u2019s just fun competition.

            "I'll give you a rundown of my career and how I got to where I am at today:\n\n* I got my associates degree in IT in Spring of 2016. Later that year in fall of 2016, I landed my first gig as a Service Desk Specialist for an Aerospace company. It was a pretty decent job and paid 17/hr starting out. I was still living at home at the time so I was able to save up alot money. I was doing menial stuff like resetting passwords, onboarding new people, setting up workstations, imaging computers, etc.\n* A year later in late 2017, I decided to move on - so I got a contract job at a well known credit card company refreshing computers. Well, it was really repetitive so I left. I was only there for 5 months.\n* January 2018, I landed a new role as an IT Specialist for a Credit Union. This is where I got the majority of my knowledge, I went from from being a help desk guy to a desktop admin, then almost a Junior Sysadmin. I was with the company for over six years. Things didn't go as planned, I was promised a sysadmin position but they never delivered so i left.\n* April 2024, I landed my first system admin position for a medium company that does federal contracting work. I do it all from working tickets, patching PCs, maintaining their cloud infrastructure, administer all the servers and virtual environment, dealing with SQL databases, and manage their network. Pretty much the whole nine yards.\n\nHere is what I can tell you from someone who's been in the field for about 9 years, you NEED to want it. You NEED to keep learning new technologies and stuff that is trending, go that extra mile at your current job and don't be afraid to have one on ones with your boss to see what you can help streamline and implement. Proactively study and document - and I can guarantee you it will help you in the long run. Trust me, I worked with people who've been in IT for 20+ years doing the same thing like helpdesk - because they do the bare minimum to get by. Don't be like this - you got to want it, own it, and CONQUER it!\n\nCongrats on the new gig by the way, I wish you the best of luck!",

Eventually got hired by one and because of nature of working in small companies, I got to touch EVERYTHING which looks great on your resume. The pay wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful and I knew the experience was needed.   \n\n\nWorked there for a year before getting another sysadmin job with more pay and responsibilities.\n\nOh and for context: \n\nI have an AAS in Cybersecurity and I am working on my BS in a Network Engineering",

Hell, I didn\u2019t even know what any of the acronyms like DNS, VOIP, DHCP meant, nor did I know what Active Directory, or Azure was.\n\nHowever I learned the definitions and what they were used for, despite me not knowing exactly what they were, I was able to explain it seemingly well to the point that they thought my knowledge was sufficient. I also treated the interview as a 2 way street, so it felt more like a conversation than an interview.\n\nAlthough im still shocked I got the role, over the past 2 years in this role I\u2019ve learned l so much about all aspects of IT and even have some certs under my belt.",

My career may have taken a longer route....different career start....family...migrating to a different country...having kids...now I am living my dream.\n\nCerts: CompTIA Network+, ISC2, ITIL, OPSWAT x3, SBT, and Microsoft x7. I skipped A+ because I found it too common and wen straight for Network+ and fought tooth and nail to get all my Microsoft Certs.\n\nLastly any advice to a tech support looking to work their way up to Sysadmin? If you are in the Helpdesk, it is crucial to progress quickly from L1-L2/L3 ASAP. When I took over and became the Sole Systems Admin on another company I am well-prepared to handle anything and everything. I think there is  just no way you can jump to Sysadmin as your first job because you need to rapidly assimilate and understand  the inside and out of your Company's current IT/Cloud Infrastructure, know how everything works in the backend, how everything is connected/integrated. What you think you need to improve on Systems/Processes. How you talk to user's in a technical way to explain things. How you explain things in  detail to your CxO boss. How to handle and not fold when you are facing multiple outages or a Crisis. Find time to somehow study/prepare for certs/keep your knowledge up to date. And of course balance your life and work."

Especially in the government sector and even more so if you can qualify for a clearance. Be open to relocating, especially to the NoVa area.\n\nI think you should apply for IT jobs right now AND do school at the same time. While in school, target internships as well, even if you're in WGU. I would bet most security interns don't have their OSCP.\n\nFirst target security jobs and I would list your bug bounty hunter as experience. Perhaps ask the hacking/pentester/redteam subreddits for specific advice regarding this on how to word it as well.\n\nI would not count on getting a remote job until you have experience. It's an extremely tough market for remote anything right now.\n\nStay strong and positive, man. Family health problems can be hard but I got a good feeling for you. If you stay in the water long enough to catch a wave, eventually you'll catch a good one. Don't give up and sit on the beach.",

Working on certs now and attempting to get a low level IT job that won't even pay my bills, but experience is experience I guess. \n\nJust sucks that even the 40k to 45k jobs want 1-5 years experience.

Started to study for the CRTO and OSEP but I stopped and I pretty much gave up on cyber and pivoting to something else for now. \n\nNot to be discouraging but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if you experience that first. Which really sucks cause we paid a good chunk of money for those OffSec certs! \n\nBut maybe with your bug bounty experience, WGU education and the extra certs, you\u2019ll break in, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. Your chances of breaking in are looking much better than mine though. Good luck!",
            "I saw you posted the same questions in one of my post threads, but I thought I would respond here instead so everyone would read it.  \n\nIn short, the company I work for wouldn't touch you for a penetration testing job if you had an OSCP with no experience in the field.  Thats the bottom line.  We have hired people with a similar track record, and it has never ended well.  Mainly because they don't know what they are breaking into.  We have had instances of infrastructure being taken down on accident because these no experience testers didn't know any better.  So now we only go after people who have a base of experience in the field when it comes to penetration testing.  At minimum, our junior level penetration testers have had 1-3 years of entry level experience somewhere.\n\nNow, you should be able to get some entry level experience somewhere with your creds.  The market is hard for people who have no experience right now though.  Plus, as you said, you live in a crap IT market where there aren't many jobs.  Is remote an option?  Of course, but I wouldn't bank on it since these remote jobs gets hundreds of resumes a day.  Since you are up against the world here, I wouldn't get my hopes up.\n\nMy advice to you would be to get some experience in the field somewhere.  Internships, part time jobs, whatever it takes.  Don't wait until you get your degree.  Start applying now and work your ass off to get something.  \n\nFinally, post your resume to r/resumes for some feedback.  Maybe it could be improved.",
            "Employers want experience first, certifications second, and degrees third. OCSP is a rock-solid certification, so that is a huge help. Those CompTIA certs that are part of the WGU program will also help a lot. But I'd recommend finding any IT work you can\u2014internships, non-profit work, help desk work, whatever.  A lot of people can pass exams, but companies are looking for people who can show proof they can apply the knowledge in a work environment."
