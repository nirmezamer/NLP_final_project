Its all very exhausting.",

        "content": "Hello, I've been pretty anxious and indecisive lately over what to do moving forward. I went back to school via community college after the pandemic. I got on a plan to get an associate degree in something that's a combination of some CS and CIS classes. I was able to get some certificates from the school but nothing major. \n\nI feel like the best I can do with this degree is transfer to a university for a bachelor's. This associate degree left me in a better spot to transfer for a CIS major but I generally preferred the CS classes and that major sounds more interesting to me. However, I'd have to take over another year of math classes to meet lower division requirements for the CS major.\n\nI also found out the community college had an IT major with a pathway where one could get networking, A+, and security certifications along the way and was told I could probably land a job right after one semester. I would have probably gone this route if I knew about it sooner. \n\nConsidering these circumstances, I would really appreciate any guidance on how to move forward. Is the extra time for a bachelor's worth it, and if so, which major? Or should I kind of start from scratch again and work on getting certifications and hopefully start working in IT sooner than later?",

As you say you have seen a little of how the networking team works. Yes, you can work with coding on those, but most of it is going to be beyond anything you would worry about. You would be better served knowing networking concepts, terminologies, and applications than straight coding(again, you can use it, depending on place, but not commonly)"
