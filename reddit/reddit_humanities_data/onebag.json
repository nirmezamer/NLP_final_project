        "content": ">**Sale/trade items must include an image of the actual item including clear evidence of your username and a recent date.** \n\nIf you have some gear sitting around that you would like to sell or trade, list it below. Items you can list include bags, travel clothing, and items that would go well in a onebag. If something is clearly outside of these categories it will likely be removed. Only list items that you are personally selling, and don't just link to a website for sale.\n\n## AUTHENTICATED IMAGE\n\n**Sale/trade items must include an image of the actual item including clear evidence of your username and a date.** For example a piece of paper on top of the item, including your username and recent date. Sales posts without this will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. If the seller is not willing to post images to this thread do not proceed with the transaction.\n\n## POST SAMPLE\n\nPost titles should look something like this:  **WTS - Osprey Porter 30L - $XX**\n\nEach post should begin with one of the following:\n\n* **WTS** (want to sell)\n* **WTB** (want to buy)\n* **WTT** (want to trade)\n\nInclude details about the pack or item. Size, condition, price, location, picture links, etc. If trading, list a few of the possible items you're looking for. Be sure to mention what country you are in, so potential buyers are aware.\n\n## TRANSACTION SAFETY TIPS\n\nBe aware that there are scammers active on Reddit, and on this sub-reddit. Any transaction comes with some risk -- decide whether the risk is worth it to you. The following tips can help reduce that risk.\n\n* Be wary of new accounts with no posting history. You are entering into a personal transaction which is entirely between you and the buyer/seller. It is entirely up to you to do your due diligence to ensure a smooth transaction.\n* Before entering into private chat with a buyer/seller ensure both parties respond directly to a comment below. This ensures respondents pass basic posting requirements, and provides an initial log of any discussion. This goes for all transactions. The more eyes on a transaction the better.\n* If you are using Paypal, use \"Goods and Services\". Never pay using the \"Friends and Family\" option. You lose a lot of leverage with Paypal when contesting F&F transactions.\n* Google search the username. Scammers are often active in multiple sub-reddits; a search might reveal a pattern of behavior. The [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/), and [r/sneakermarket/banlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/wiki/index/banlist) are good resources providing some supplemental background to the people you're dealing with. Obviously this should not be your only source, but it can offer some great insight.",

The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** & TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\n\n_For details about destinations, activities, budget, expenses and the like, please refer [\ud83d\udcac **to this previous comment of mine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c5co34/32_days_in_japan_in_march/kzyff83/)_\n\n\n* For the interested, [\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Some **pictures** of the trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c5co34/32_days_in_japan_in_march/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\nAnd now without further ado, **the detailed and complete**\n\n#| **PACKING LIST**\n\n##\ud83c\udf92 **BAGS,** POUCHES & KITS\n\n* **Backpack** (18L) -

In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* \ud83d\udd01 **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* \ud83d\udd01 I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2753 _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

Has this happened to you and how\u2019d you overcome it for your next trip?\n\n\nBack in March, I unintentionally did a 9-day trip to Austin with my wife\u2019s 40L Baboon to the Moon Go Bag. I did it without packing cubes, ranger rolling shirts, or other space saving methods I\u2019ve learned about since. It was a happy accident and got me interested in this type of travel. \n\nEarlier this month, I was going to NYC for 5 days. Since it was a shorter trip, I intentionally tried to travel with a smaller bag - the 22L LLBean stowaway bag. I generally like packing because it\u2019s like a fun puzzle, but my fun puzzle devolved into me losing my mind. I labored over the best way to pack, how much to pack, questioned what I would actually need vs. what would be nice to have, etc. \n\nIn the end, I packed the majority in the bag and also used an Eddie Bauer 25L stowaway tote for snacks and small misc. items. The trip was great and I wasn\u2019t longing for anything that I had left behind at home, which makes my spiral maybe a little more embarrassing. \n\nHas this ever happened to you and how did you overcome it for the next trip?

            "I wouldn\u2019t call it anxiety on my end, but overthinking at times. That\u2019s been mitigated by making a packing list well ahead of time, so if I need anything I\u2019m buying the right thing with time to spare. It\u2019s also resulted in some realizations over time as well, like \u201cIs this really a one bag trip, or is it an under seat + carry on trip?,\u201d \u201csince we\u2019re already doing certain things and a lot of waking, do I actually think I\u2019m going to go to the gym, or will the waking & some simple body weight exercises be enough?,\u201d \u201chow many outfit combos can I make from these few neutral colored pieces?,\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s the smallest sized toiletry items I can get away with on this trip & plan on running out?\u201d It\u2019s taken a few trips, but I\u2019m no longer forcing unnecessary one bagging and doing it comfortably when I am.

            "Yup. I've stressed about over- and under-packing. Since, we travel primarily in Autumn, I've had enough iterations to know what I tend to wear; what I definitely don't wear even tho' I fool myself into thinking I might, and how much socks & underwear I need; etc. After a few rounds of this you get your stuff dialed in and then all's well in the universe.  \n\nAlso, that 22L LLBean is a nice daypack for hiking/city-strolling.",
            "This is why I can't, for the life of me, understand why anyone travels with anything less than approximately the size of a maximum carry-on (about 40L.)\n\nA 40L pack is still tiny, considering you're living your life out of it. I can barely comfortably fit my stuff in one, and it's not like I'm packing tons of clothes. And it's nice to have extra room for souvenirs, temporary groceries, and unexpected items.",
            "I make a Excel list and label stuff as \"necessary\" and \"nice to have\". Pack all the necessary stuff first and then chose between your \"nice to have\" items.\nHaving a list (which I calculated before, what I *really* need) keeps my peace of mind. It also saves so much time when packing.",
            "No anxiety.  I have a  draw in my dresser with all my travel clothes and items in it and I know they weigh 6.5kg ie carry on weight.If I get tired of something   I  replace it with something similar. Well, it works for me."

        "content": "I have a two week trip planned for Japan for the end of September - early October and I was just looking for some of your opinions on this! \n\nI have a Patagonia MLC Mini that I used exclusively when I went to Asia for 3 weeks last year, and it was amazing for that. My one issue is I wanted to a LOT more shopping there than I managed to do due to my bag. I did end up getting a decently large tote, but the MLC isn\u2019t a great underseat bag \u2014 and the tote was packed to the brim. I want to have some legroom on these 13+ hour flights! \n\nFor Japan, I\u2019m planning on buying a lot more souvenirs and clothes for both myself and others. \n\nI\u2019m flying with Air Canada (carry on only), but I do also get a personal item. I\u2019ve been thinking of using a smaller bag for underseat personal item usage (Day Owl Backpack) and was also thinking of bringing my Samsonite carry on roller basically empty. I understand I can also just buy luggage there, or even ship items back. I\u2019m also not dead set on a roller but I think it would make shopping much easier. \n\nI\u2019m well versed in packing and travelling lightly, and I know bringing \u201ctwo bags\u201d (especially a roller) kind of goes against the grain there. I unfortunately will be working a bit on the trip so I need to bring a 14\u201d laptop and some other tech essentials / some nicer clothes. \n\nI guess my ultimate question is \u2014 how much of a hassle do you guys think a roller + small backpack would be in Japan, especially for trains. I\u2019ll only be taking ~5 trains with my luggage so I\u2019m not too concerned about minor inconvenience. Will also exclusively be staying in urban areas. \n\nOr if you have any other suggestions or experiences to share I would love to hear them!\n",

            "Backpack and carry on sized roller is the standard light travel method in Japan. You'll have no issue on trains, including subways, but I'd avoid busses when you have a suitcase. Just make sure your accommodations are near transit stations. I'd also avoid traveling during rush hour.\n\nI saw someone else mention that you might need to book large luggage tickets on the shinkansen, but you definitely won't. Your carry on will fit in the overhead storage. You only need to book the oversized luggage space if you have a huge checked bag.",
            "If you plan to visit Kyoto, buses are so clouded that it\u2019s almost impossible to carry your luggage in them. Please use taxis.",
            "I'd use the roller and if you can, put the backpack on as back up luggage.\nPeople on the internet talk a lot of shot about japan. You'll find heaps of Japanese people with small luggage on the train.",
            "Even if you stay 2 weeks in Tokyo only.. you'll leave happy.",
            "I sometimes use my Evergoods CTB26 in conjunction with my Verage underseat roller. It\u2019s 18x14x8. That\u2019s my personal item and the CTB goes up top.",
            "There are luggage forwarding services in Japan, but you might need to send your suitcase ahead of you the day before.",
            "Like traveling with a pet chimpanzee but the chimp can get up the stairs without help. A packable tote is what comes to mind.",
            "A backpack is generally more annoying for other people on buses than a case.",
