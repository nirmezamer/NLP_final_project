        "content": ">**Sale/trade items must include an image of the actual item including clear evidence of your username and a recent date.** \n\nIf you have some gear sitting around that you would like to sell or trade, list it below. Items you can list include bags, travel clothing, and items that would go well in a onebag. If something is clearly outside of these categories it will likely be removed. Only list items that you are personally selling, and don't just link to a website for sale.\n\n## AUTHENTICATED IMAGE\n\n**Sale/trade items must include an image of the actual item including clear evidence of your username and a date.** For example a piece of paper on top of the item, including your username and recent date. Sales posts without this will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. If the seller is not willing to post images to this thread do not proceed with the transaction.\n\n## POST SAMPLE\n\nPost titles should look something like this:  **WTS - Osprey Porter 30L - $XX**\n\nEach post should begin with one of the following:\n\n* **WTS** (want to sell)\n* **WTB** (want to buy)\n* **WTT** (want to trade)\n\nInclude details about the pack or item. Size, condition, price, location, picture links, etc. If trading, list a few of the possible items you're looking for. Be sure to mention what country you are in, so potential buyers are aware.\n\n## TRANSACTION SAFETY TIPS\n\nBe aware that there are scammers active on Reddit, and on this sub-reddit. Any transaction comes with some risk -- decide whether the risk is worth it to you. The following tips can help reduce that risk.\n\n* Be wary of new accounts with no posting history. You are entering into a personal transaction which is entirely between you and the buyer/seller. It is entirely up to you to do your due diligence to ensure a smooth transaction.\n* Before entering into private chat with a buyer/seller ensure both parties respond directly to a comment below. This ensures respondents pass basic posting requirements, and provides an initial log of any discussion. This goes for all transactions. The more eyes on a transaction the better.\n* If you are using Paypal, use \"Goods and Services\". Never pay using the \"Friends and Family\" option. You lose a lot of leverage with Paypal when contesting F&F transactions.\n* Google search the username. Scammers are often active in multiple sub-reddits; a search might reveal a pattern of behavior. The [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/), and [r/sneakermarket/banlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/wiki/index/banlist) are good resources providing some supplemental background to the people you're dealing with. Obviously this should not be your only source, but it can offer some great insight.",

The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** & TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\n\n_For details about destinations, activities, budget, expenses and the like, please refer [\ud83d\udcac **to this previous comment of mine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c5co34/32_days_in_japan_in_march/kzyff83/)_\n\n\n* For the interested, [\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Some **pictures** of the trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c5co34/32_days_in_japan_in_march/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\nAnd now without further ado, **the detailed and complete**\n\n#| **PACKING LIST**\n\n##\ud83c\udf92 **BAGS,** POUCHES & KITS\n\n* **Backpack** (18L) -

In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* \ud83d\udd01 **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* \ud83d\udd01 I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up!

Has this happened to you and how\u2019d you overcome it for your next trip?\n\n\nBack in March, I unintentionally did a 9-day trip to Austin with my wife\u2019s 40L Baboon to the Moon Go Bag. I did it without packing cubes, ranger rolling shirts, or other space saving methods I\u2019ve learned about since. It was a happy accident and got me interested in this type of travel. \n\nEarlier this month, I was going to NYC for 5 days. Since it was a shorter trip, I intentionally tried to travel with a smaller bag - the 22L LLBean stowaway bag. I generally like packing because it\u2019s like a fun puzzle, but my fun puzzle devolved into me losing my mind. I labored over the best way to pack, how much to pack, questioned what I would actually need vs. what would be nice to have, etc. \n\nIn the end, I packed the majority in the bag and also used an Eddie Bauer 25L stowaway tote for snacks and small misc. items. The trip was great and I wasn\u2019t longing for anything that I had left behind at home, which makes my spiral maybe a little more embarrassing. \n\nHas this ever happened to you and how did you overcome it for the next trip?

            "Maybe the anxiety stems from trying to force everything into a small pack. If your wife's pack was a happy accident, increase the size of your pack so it doesn't cause you anxiety",
            "Do I stress over packing? No I actually enjoy it. \n\nJumping to a bag half the size sounds like a head banging session. 22 liters is a noble quest but requires a very frugal and carefully assembled packing list.\n\nStart with a packing list and your best effort for packing techniques. Load into a cardboard box or your wife\u2019s bag and see how much space it takes up. Basically that\u2019s a reality check. Want it smaller? Throw something out. \n\nI\u2019m in of a mind that the only reason to go with a small bag is for an under seat only kit. I use 18\u201dx14\u201dx8\u201d as a general under seat maximum. I\u2019ve settled on the REI Trail 25 for that and it\u2019s 18\u201dx13\u201dx8\u201d. \n\n\nFrom there you\u2019re into overhead sized bags from roughly 30 to 40 liters. Nothing wrong with that but it will get heavier and bulkier. As you approach 40 liters the weight is getting to paint where a load transferring harness with a load bearing hip belt is more comfortable and bags like the Osprey Farpoint 40 come into the picture. One 30 liter side, bags like the Patagonia MLC 30 and Black Hole 32 and the Topo Designs Global Travel 30 are good. \n\nI use a medium compression packing cube, a small garment folder and a slim cube along with several one liter pouches for toiletries, EDC and small tech.",
            "Not me, but\u2026..  My wife does EVERY time.\n\nShe waits till 2 hours before we have to leave for the airport because of the stress.  I tell the same thing EVERY time:\n\n1). Just pack your undies and PJs first.  Get them into a cube.\n\n2). Pack your meds/cosmetic bag next.\n\n3)  Flip flops into a bag.\n\n4). Blouses go into another cube.\n\n5). Now how much room do you have left over for pants????\n\nSame routine EVERY time\u2026.  At least now she\u2019s leaving blow dryers and extra shoes at home so we have some progress.",
            "No.",
            "i am generally an anxious traveler, and packing is sometimes the worst of it for me - between my sensory needs/prefs, my various fashion inclinations, debates about formality level needed, etc\n\nfrom my personal experience (ymmv) - start with a larger bag, and use it as a fallback when trying to pack smaller bags.\n\ni got a lil 28l that i\u2019ve wanted to run for my past two trips, but am only finally now taking it for a spin. i didn\u2019t freak out too hard about not fitting my shit in it the past couple times because i had a slightly larger fallback bag (closer to 35l) that i swapped out for.\n\nultimately, there are no-to-minimal impact to me having to size up my bag in the course of packing (to an extent); the cops aren\u2019t coming, i\u2019m not getting in trouble with anyone, nobody (else) is mad at me, etc.\n\nas you build onebagging skills n kit, you may end up using your fallbacks less and less - and can save them for trips where the space is needed / game changer-y",

            "I make a list way ahead of time and stick to it, including what is going into which cubes/pouches and where it\u2019s going in my bag. I use either a Topo Designs 40L Global Travel or my Evergoods CTB26 depending on where I\u2019m going and for how long.

However, you are not going into some remote desert or up a mountain; you so be in a place where you can use money and get what is needed, and you don\u2019t need that much.\n\nAsk yourself what\u2019s the worst that would happen if you don\u2019t have X on the trip.\n\nPassport, cards and money, phone, charge/powerbank for phone. These are the key things required for the trip, except and context specific requirements e.g. laptop and charger for work. You could /r/zerobag the rest especially if in the same country.\n\nHere\u2019s a challenge, next time try 10l for a weekend break.",

Easy pack, stable weather and if I forgot anything would be able to buy it there.\n\nTrekking in Nepal - that was months of thinking about what to pack due to changing weather, remoteness and specific gear needed."

        "content": "I have a two week trip planned for Japan for the end of September - early October and I was just looking for some of your opinions on this! \n\nI have a Patagonia MLC Mini that I used exclusively when I went to Asia for 3 weeks last year, and it was amazing for that. My one issue is I wanted to a LOT more shopping there than I managed to do due to my bag. I did end up getting a decently large tote, but the MLC isn\u2019t a great underseat bag \u2014 and the tote was packed to the brim. I want to have some legroom on these 13+ hour flights! \n\nFor Japan, I\u2019m planning on buying a lot more souvenirs and clothes for both myself and others. \n\nI\u2019m flying with Air Canada (carry on only), but I do also get a personal item. I\u2019ve been thinking of using a smaller bag for underseat personal item usage (Day Owl Backpack) and was also thinking of bringing my Samsonite carry on roller basically empty. I understand I can also just buy luggage there, or even ship items back. I\u2019m also not dead set on a roller but I think it would make shopping much easier. \n\nI\u2019m well versed in packing and travelling lightly, and I know bringing \u201ctwo bags\u201d (especially a roller) kind of goes against the grain there. I unfortunately will be working a bit on the trip so I need to bring a 14\u201d laptop and some other tech essentials / some nicer clothes. \n\nI guess my ultimate question is \u2014 how much of a hassle do you guys think a roller + small backpack would be in Japan, especially for trains. I\u2019ll only be taking ~5 trains with my luggage so I\u2019m not too concerned about minor inconvenience. Will also exclusively be staying in urban areas. \n\nOr if you have any other suggestions or experiences to share I would love to hear them!\n",

            "It\u2019s not a big hassle to bring a small roller and backpack. I\u2019ve done it before!\n\nThe major train stations have a lot of stairs and levels, but there\u2019s elevators (and escalators sometimes) if you don\u2019t want to carry your roller up and down flights of stairs.\n- I packed my roller to be light enough that I could carry it because I didn\u2019t like the hassle of trying to find the elevators. My roller is 40L.\n\nWhen you\u2019re on the train, it\u2019s most polite to wear your backpack front-facing, as it takes up less overall space, and you won\u2019t accidentally hit someone with your backpack. Be mindful that your roller luggage is tucked closely to you so no one trips over it.\n- on Shinkansen, you may have to book a luggage spot in advance. They put them in a designated luggage spot in each train car. Check the dimension regulations to see if your bag needs to be booked. Many tourists didn\u2019t seem to know about it, and they had giant luggage that they had to keep at their seat (which gave them no leg room for their journey)",

            "Backpack and carry on sized roller is the standard light travel method in Japan. You'll have no issue on trains, including subways, but I'd avoid busses when you have a suitcase. Just make sure your accommodations are near transit stations. I'd also avoid traveling during rush hour.\n\nI saw someone else mention that you might need to book large luggage tickets on the shinkansen, but you definitely won't. Your carry on will fit in the overhead storage. You only need to book the oversized luggage space if you have a huge checked bag.",

Not just trains but buses, subways, stairs, cobblestone, dirt, etc.\n\nMost infrastructure is designed for light travel in Japan - depending on the mode of transportation you may also have to book a specific ticket for the roller luggage\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy first Japan trip in 2019, my then-girlfriend and I **each** had a rolling luggage, 1 backpack and another bag - we kept moving around so it was super cumbersome to carry every time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI strongly recommend **not** bringing a rolling luggage and really recommend simply **using Japan Post** to ship yourself souvenirs\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Useful Fact**\n\n**DON QUIJOTE**'s shopping basket offers the same volume as a Medium-Sized parcel box from Japan Post! So if you can completely saturate such a basket, you'll be able to fit everything in a medium-sized JP parcel.",

Though I usually bring a checked bag because I'm visiting family and it's customary to bring gifts from the US.\n\nShinkansen typically have a place to put larger checked bags and I've never worried about theft on the train. A carry-on roller should be less of a problem on a shinkansen as there are over-head rails for carry-on sized bags\n\nConversely many Japanese trains stations very greatly in age they don't all have escalators. Hand carrying my suitcase up and down stairs is pretty much a guaranteed event for me.\n\nIf I didn't have to carry items that needed to be checked I personally would have gone with an expandable carry-on sized travel backpack with a sternum strap and waist belt. The kind that starts around 20\\~28 liter and expands to 40\\~45 liter. The sternum strap and waist belt are to help steady the weight of the bag.\n\nI'd then add a 3-in-1 (Backpack/Cross-body/Tote) or a 2-in-1 (Cross-body/tote) that fits underseat as a personal item and keep a travel purse or fannypack inside it.",
