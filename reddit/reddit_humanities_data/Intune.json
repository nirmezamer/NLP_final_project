Windows Hello does work. And also wifi certificate authentication work with my onprem wifi network.. ca cert is deployed with a policy and everything is working.\n\nAlso printer driver is deployed\u2026. \n\nThis is about a Followme printer devices.. so they have secured printer Ports and not directly an ip adress (ricoh streamline)\n\nCan someone give me so advice Or links what i need to do to make it work?\n\n",

            "RE: Security question\n\nAs its a user-led provision, you still need a username/password to start the enrolment. It then looks up the serial number in the tenant the user is attached to in order to validate it as a corporate device. \n\nThey will probably have to introduce a mechanism when/if they look to bring in device pre-provisioning. Obviously the mechanism with v1 is that you can only bind a hardware hash to a single tenant."

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy new organization was recently hit by a ransomware attack. In response, they started resetting passwords for a few users and are now enforcing stricter requirements (longer, more complex passwords). This is a crucial step. However, I'm concerned about the burden of remembering and entering these new complex passwords for Windows login, VPN (SSO), applications, etc. Most of the users are working remotely, and devices are joined to the domain (HAADJ).\n\nI'm wondering if deploying Windows Hello for Business + passwordless login with MS Authenticator or FIDO2 security keys alongside a broad password reset would be a win-win solution. We would require a more complex passwords but would mitigate it by going passwordless.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! Should we prioritize a rapid and broad password reset and then followed by a gradual rollout of WHfB and then phone/FIDO2 login options? \n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

            "To add to this; set complex passwords, forget them, set passwords to never expire and start using TAP.\n\nO, and move away from that silly hybrid join stuff ...",
            "Im just starting to roll out WHFB. It took a while to iron out the issues but now its working great. I started out deploying Hybrid joined computers to see how well it does on the domain network. Now Im deploying Entra ID computers. It seems to me the users have a better experience with WHFB + SSO if they on Entra ID joined devices.\n\nOhBTW - if youre going SSO for VPN, I would suggest for you to restrict users to only use Phish resistant MFA methods. You can set this up in Microsoft Conditional Access."
