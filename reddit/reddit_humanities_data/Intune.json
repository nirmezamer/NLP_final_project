I wipe a profile to test things out again and nothing in my hkcu-oriented remediation fires off on the first login.  OK, let's reboot.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And force syncs.  Again.  And Again.  And force run the remediation which evidently is supposed to be an answer for lagging BS like this.  Go for a walk for over an hour.  Come back and it's still \"run remediation pending...\"\n\nHow the heck are people getting machines prepped in a reasonable amount of time - and how are they doing end-user-driven autopilot?  \"OK, unbox the laptop and go through the setup and sign in and mfa and then you'll be in windows but you need to open Teams and Outlook and click through the defaults - then reboot.  And reboot again.  And 3x for good measure (three times man, you always tell me to reboot three times).  Then call the helpdesk.\"\n\nWould love to leave our gpos behind, but JFC they just work...",

I have a lab set up just for Intune and all computers tested are on Ethernet connections. Wipes, config deployments, app deployments, etc take random times.

Deployments are instant, you get feedback/logs/status updates immediately in the PDQ portal.

My org allows them to defer the restart and we don't force auto shutdowns for some reason."

In response, they started resetting passwords for a few users and are now enforcing stricter requirements (longer, more complex passwords). This is a crucial step. However, I'm concerned about the burden of remembering and entering these new complex passwords for Windows login, VPN (SSO), applications, etc. Most of the users are working remotely, and devices are joined to the domain (HAADJ).\n\nI'm wondering if deploying Windows Hello for Business + passwordless login with MS Authenticator or FIDO2 security keys alongside a broad password reset would be a win-win solution. We would require a more complex passwords but would mitigate it by going passwordless.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! Should we prioritize a rapid and broad password reset and then followed by a gradual rollout of WHfB and then phone/FIDO2 login options? \n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",
