One that is really helpfully or informative, one that educates OP with respect and kindness?\n\n> One of those comments that makes you want to wave at OP and point it out to them. You know, one of those comments you would give an award to when awards still existed?\n\n> Alas, we don\u2019t have the power to bring back awards (we\u2019d only wish) but we now do have a way to celebrate those comments that deserve it.\n\n> Starting right now, if you see a comment that deserves special attention for being really helpful, informative that you want to put in the spotlight reply to that comment with;\n\n> !readthisone\n\n> That will notify the mods and we\u2019ll (have a bot) hand out one point to the author of the comment.\n\n> Once we\u2019ve monitored the system for a while to catch and fix any kinks, you can award points without us having to do it for you.\n\n> &#x200B;\n\n> * UPDATE: What do the points do, other than bragging rights \ud83d\ude02 ? There will be a post to honour and keep track of the most valued commenters. We'll post that a few weeks from now, so it might be time to improve your commenting or to show your appreciation of great comments\n* I made an awesome comment, can I give myself a point? Nope, you can\u2019t. You should make your comment so awesome that others want to give you a point for it.\n\n> &#x200B;\n\n>",
