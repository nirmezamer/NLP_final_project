        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nAlthough we do our best to make the rules of this subreddit as clear as we can within the characters limits, we notice that sometimes there\u2019s some confusion or misunderstanding about the rules.\n\nThis post is about rule number one, and applies to each photo you add to your post.\n\n* All photos need to be **clear, in focus, well lit.**\n* All photos need to be **close up** to showcase the piercing or relevant body part in detail. \n* Poses should be neutral and designed to **show off only the piercing**.\n* No nudity beyond what is strictly necessary to show the piercing\n* Credit the piercer and shop by name whenever possible, include jewelry information if you can\n* Do not include social media handles, shop website links or (self) promotion in either photo or text\n\nBelow we will explain each bullet point in detail.\n\n# All photos need to be clear, in focus, well lit.\n\nIf you use more than one photo in your post then each photos should follow the guidelines. \n\n**Clear** means that a photo should be easily understandable.  People shouldn\u2019t have to guess what sort of piercing they are looking at nor should the photo be so filtered that features are lost.  **In focus** is often a problem when photos are enlarged and cropped. If a photo is in focus but you then enlarge and crop it, it often becomes too grainy/pixelated to be able to see the piercing or problem clearly. **Well lit**. Artificial lightning often causes a photo to be too dark and grainy/pixelated to show case the piercing well.\n\n# All photos need to be close up to showcase the piercing or relevant body part in detail.\n\nPeople visit Reddit through all sort of devices with various screen sizes. If you want advice on what facial piercings would look good on you or if you want to show off your facial set up, your face should take up at least 2/3 of the total photo height. If you want to show your navel piercing we should not be able to tell how big or small your waist is. If you have a question about your nipple piercings, you should not be able to tell whether you have big or small breasts. The only thing that should be visible of you in the photo should be the piercing or the specific body part you have a question about. Of course cats can be featured in the photo, but don\u2019t expect people to pay attention to your piercing then and don\u2019t forget to mention the name of the cat.\n\n***Photography tips!*** Often the front facing camera of your phone is not as good as the back camera. To photograph yourself with the back camera, simply get a mirror. With some angling you can see the screen of your phone in the mirror and can then frame, focus and take the photo with the better quality back camera. \n\nFor well lit photos it\u2019s best to take them during daylight, preferably outdoors. If it\u2019s not an option to wait for daylight, get somewhere well lit, like a bathroom. Add some more lights if possible because artificial light may look bright to you, a camera needs more light. It might not do wonders for your complexion, but it's the piercing that matters. \n\nLook up the minimum distance your camera needs to be able to focus. If you hold the camera too close, your camera may not be able to focus. If your camera has a \" food photography\" setting, use that because it tends to work well for things like ear piercings.\n\n# Poses should be neutral and designed to show off only the piercing.\n\nInstagram and other fun filters shouldn\u2019t be used in photos. Poses should be neutral, so don\u2019t show off cleavage unless your post is about your chest dermals. Do not post photos where you flip the bird, are blowing smoke, are trying to seduce the viewer or we can tell where you are based on your surroundings. Don\u2019t stick out your tongue in photo if you\u2018re not showing off your tongue piercing. If needed, simply take a new photo instead of the fun photo you send to your friend last night or the photo that would do well on a dating website.\n\n# There should be no nudity in the picture beyond what is necessary to show the piercing.\n\nIf your photo follows the already discussed guidelines, then this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Your photo shouldn\u2019t show any skin besides the part that\u2018s pierced or you have a question about. Want to show of your PA, that\u2019s fine as long as you tag NSFW, but we shouldn\u2019t be able to see anything else of your body. If you want to show of more, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but there are subreddits for that, this subreddit is solely about piercings.\n\n# Credit the piercer and shop by name whenever possible, include jewelry information if you can\n\nThere are amazing piercers that do great work. Especially if you are pleased with the work they\u2019ve done for you, credit them. Amazing piercers deserve all the recognition and the publicity.\n\n# Do not include social media handles, shop website (links) or (self) promotion in either photo or text\n\nThis one should speak for itself but we do want to specify that it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t mention the shop name of where your piercer works.\n\n# Additionally,\n\n**Moderators** will remove posts when the photo(s) used in post don\u2019t follow this subreddit rule. If we do that, you will receive a message explaining why your photo isn\u2019t in line with the rule and an invitation to repost with a suitable photo. As moderators we do our best to assess all photos posted but if you see a photo that doesn\u2019t follow the rule of this subreddit, or if you see any other content that doesn\u2019t follow the rules of this subreddit, please hit the report button so we can assess it and take action if needed.\n\n**The** **advice we** actually dislike to give, because it shouldn\u2019t be needed. If you are posting a photo, especially of nipple or genital piercings consider (temporarily) **disabling DM\u2019s**. Most of our community is awesome and wouldn\u2019t even consider breaking the \u201cno comments about appearance or sexual comments\u201d rule even if it wasn\u2019t a rule. Unfortunately that doesn\u2019t go for everyone that will see your photo. Moderators can and will act on comments that break rule 4 so don't hesitate to use the **report button** to notify the mods. \n\n* [Report chat](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035472-How-do-I-report-a-chat-message-)\n* [Report DM](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058752951-How-do-I-report-a-private-message-)\n\n**Additionally, if you want** to post a photo here because you would like people to comment on your overall appearance, body or face, then this is not the right subreddit. There's nothing wrong with wanting that, but this subreddit is strictly about piercings.\n\nWorried because you are unsure if your photo follows the rule? If you want you can add \u201crequest check by mod\u201d flair to your post and we will check it for you before your post goes up.\n\n**If you have any additional photography tips you would like to see included or if you have any questions,** please send a [message to the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpiercing)",

I met someone the other day that has had hers for 4 years and it looked bad\u2026 like it hasn\u2019t healed whatsoever.\n\nSo my question is, would I be able to put some studs in to let it heal easier? Would that mess up the holes too much for me to fit the spiral back in?\n\nI\u2019m about to clean it, I just knew I\u2019d forget yet again to take a picture to ask",

            "Hoops are not meant for initial healing. Better change to long titanium steel flatback studs then only downsize them once their initial swelling is gone or after 4-6 weeks.",
            "okay so. yes the easy and reasonable route would be changing to flatbacks and just hoping they heal aligned enough to insert the spiral back in. \n\nthis is technically like an industrial piercing but worse. there is a slim chance to heal it like this. its gonna be a long and unpleasant experience and ultimately depends on your luck. i do think the 6-12mo timeframe is unrealistic. my industrial took 2 years to fully heal.",
            "Remove the spiral and let them heal separately. Every time you bump the jewelry you piss off all 3 holes, it\u2019s going to be a losing fight to heal it that way. If you change to well-fitted flatbacks and can avoid sleeping on that side you shouldn\u2019t have to worry much about migration. People like to doom and gloom about alignment when it comes to healing industrial piercings with separate jewelry but it can absolutely be done and still be properly aligned.\u00a0",
            "I would definitely 100% take that out and switch them all to flat back straight bars to heal. Whoever did that to you is out of their mind. Hoops are not meant for initial healing and does nothing but prolong healing",
            "Definitely go and get some flatback titanium posts installed. Due to proximity of the piercings, you might need to opt for simple ends too. \nOnce they all heal, you can wear your fancy ring again\ud83d\ude0a\nI am waiting for my conch to truly heal before I can wear anything fancy on it.",
            "Whoever told you that 3 simultaneous cartilage piercings on one of the hardest spots to heal would only take 6-12 months completely made that up lol. I have a tragus piercing that took about 2-3 years to heal completely, and a daith piercing that is just now starting to heal internally and not be visibly irritated after 3 ish years (though mine was on the longer side). Cartilage piercings are fickle and can depend on the person, but if you\u2019re getting multiple at once it definitely extends healing time (your body is spreading its resources across multiple wounds instead of just one). That\u2019s why it\u2019s often not recommend to get like more than 2 at once, because then they take forever to heal. Helix is a tough spot and cartilage needs to be babied for upwards of a year before it will heal. Don\u2019t touch it like your life depends on it, try your very best not to let it snag, don\u2019t sleep on it, don\u2019t put anything on it except for saline no matter who tries to tell you otherwise. Don\u2019t use a q tip or cotton round to clean it, just allow the saline to run over it or water from the shower to wash the crusties away. Only use a q tip to clean it if you\u2019re applying featherlight pressure. Try to dry it out after it gets wet with a hairdryer. But this setup might be very difficult. I would honestly recommend you heal all 3 independently with some very low profile jewelry and then switch it down the line",
            "Love the jewelry! I have a spiral in my lobe. But, yes, as others have said, not a good idea for the healing phase. Swap it out until the piercings are happily healed and then put that bad boy back in.",
            "This is a super advanced healing project which a piercer should have not agreed to do on somebody who isn't already highly pierced and very expierenced with healing cartilage. A newbie can maybe handle healing a triple helix with normal labrets, but even that will be challenging as the more you get the more brutal the healing. 1 single labret helix will take about a year to heal. With each additional piercing you increase that time cuz your immune system is working on each one. You're working on 3. Zero chance they're all perfect in his time estimate. And that's for labrets. This adds a whole new level of complication with this spiral ring. It's probably technically healable as-is the way orbitals are healable, but it requires an expert level aftercare skillset that most do not have. If I we're YOU I'd get the labrets. Don't sleep on that side ever and hopefully the spiral can fit in roughly 1 year from the date you swap the jewelry (as this has set you back to day 1). If not a high end shop (NOT this one) can probably custom bend one for you that will fit. I have nearly 40 piercings and still wouldn't have attempted this.",
            "Triple helix dam got some guts I'm happy with one at the time but yeah as others stated and no disrespect labret are best to help with healing in the long run. All the best \ud83e\udd18",
