I was a pretty active mod here for awhile, and stepped back once the sub was in good hands. It's been great watching the sub get huge, I still remember hitting the 1mil mark and being super excited about it.\n\nWhile I haven't really been as visible here lately, I've always kept an eye on the place and it's been fun watching it grow. Today I'm formally turning my mod keys in, and I guess I just wanted to say goodbye to the first Reddit community I was ever in charge of. Y'all are great.\n\nRemember, [Be excellent to each other. And party on, dudes.](https://youtu.be/rph_1DODXDU)",

        "content": "#EDIT: The ban has been extended indefinitely, until such time where the mod team determines it's safe to revoke it. We've noticed that this sub does not suffer from lack of quality content without the political posts, and provides a safe haven from people, both in the US and overseas, who want a slight break from the incessant shitshow that is the US political system. \n\nMembers and subscribers of r/MurderedByWords - You have spoken, and we have listened. \n\nOver the past year we've been deluged with messages, direct chats and modmails asking us to please do something about the incessant political posts on this sub. We have been called \"a less funny version of r/politicalhumor\", which is pretty damn insulting. \n\nHowever, when we tried to have a temporary ban on all political content, the subreddit suffered - Less posts were submitted, which led to less comments and less interaction. We need to remember that the final purpose of this sub is to entertain our subscribers, visitors and lurkers, provide you the content you are looking for. \n\nFast forward to today - It's 2 months before the US Presidential, Congressional and Senatorial Elections, the political posts are getting worse than ever, and with them the requests to do something about it. To that end, the moderation team has discussed this, and beginning from Sept 3, we will be imposing a temporary ban on all things related to the US Elections until after Elections Day (Nov 3). \n\nWhat does this mean? Posts meeting any of these criteria will be removed immediately, and the user will receive a temporary ban:\n\n* If any of the people in the post is in public office, is running for public office, or holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff \n* If the subject of the post is in public office or running for public office, or holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff\n* If any of the people in the post or the subject of the post is anyhow related to the Trump or Biden family or to someone who holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff\n\nExamples of posts which are now prohibited include:\n\n* Orange Man Bad\n* Jeff Tiedrich (who really needs to get a fucking life)\n* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweets\n* Lincoln Project\n* The Conway family\n*  Hunter Biden posts\n\nPlease note that this is **NOT YET** a full ban on all political subjects or a full ban on all political content going beyond the elections. We will be keeping very close attention during the upcoming two months to see how the subreddit and our members react to this ban. If we see that it is successful, we may choose to extend it. We also would appreciate your comments on this post to let us know your thoughts on the subject.",

            "The entire premise of Murdered By Words is a stinging counterpoint by one individual to an ignorant, egotistical, self-righteous, and/or hypocritical statement made by another individual.   \n\n\nA quick scan of this sub demonstrates that an outsized number of ignorant , egotistical, self-righteous, and/or hypocritical statements come from the right side of the aisle, and the counterpoint \"murders\" come from the left. Trump, his cronies, and his progeny open themselves up to rhetorical homicide on a daily basis. If the right wing followers of this sub don't like how often somebody accurately calls this administration (and related syndicate) on their nonsense, they are more than welcome to downvote, hide the post, make a counter-counterpoint, block the redditor who shared the murder in question, and/or locate an example of a linguistic assassination that goes in the other direction. (If they can find one that doesn't contain hate speech.) They can even unfollow the sub. There are already processes by which they can see fewer \"political\" posts.  \n\n\nInstead, they chose to go the \"snow crystal\" route and complain to you that \"There's too much politics!\" There isn't too much politics. There's too much politics that doesn't fit their worldview for which they can offer no obverse. So they want you to unbalance things for them, and you are obliging them. And in obliging them, you are opening yourself to be further constrained by them. Once Trump and the rest of his swamp are off the table, they're going to complain to you that too many people are going after Charlie Kirk or people making \"All Lives Matter\" tweets. Soon they'll be asking you to ban posts that burn ignorant statements from law enforcement. They will dictate to you the content of this sub rather than the other way around. You said you've been deluged by complaints. Can you quantify that? A thousand complaints? Ten thousand? One hundred thousand? There are **two million members** of this sub. How many \"squeaky wheels\" are making you steer this sub away from a course that I would hazard to guess a vast majority of the members are and have been perfectly content with?   \n\n\nIf being called \"a less funny version of [r/politicalhumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/)\" is enough to get under your skin, maybe you aren't cut out to moderate a sub that specializes in well-crafted insults. But I would think you'd prefer being called \"a less funny version of [r/politicalhumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/)\" to \"a castrated version of r/MurderedByWords.\"  \n\n\nThose are my \"thoughts on the subject,\" as requested.",

Often the most upvoted posts are political in nature. Just banning the content because some users are complaining is one sided and doesn't acknowledge all the users still voting for this content.",
