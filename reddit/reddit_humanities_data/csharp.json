I think I often went with ToList if only because it provided more flexibility but often I wouldn't really need it.",
            "Need more benchmark posts like this, thanks for sharing",
            "Why the random numbers? How would this method be affected by the content of the collection? What's more, the tests of different .net versions now use different content, so if there _is_ a dependency on the collection content the results would be incomparable.",
            "Performance concerns aside, I have encountered many devs using `ToList()` when they never intend to add to the collection. A list by definition could have elements added to it and arrays can only be mutated. Why use list in the instances when you are creating a dataset that has a defined size?",
            "Problem with every benchmark its simple data sets used until ur doing it with a few million records ur not getting a true feel",
            "They probably didn't implement it in List since the size of the list can change, while an array is fixed size.",
            "If you look at the code for List in .net 8, you'll likely see some fairly obvious opportunities for improved performance, at the cost of a tiny amount of memory for that operation, in isolation.\n\nBut, in a lot of real-world applications, you're not calling one method once in a vacuum with Lists, so it's strange to me that it's optimized for that case and not anything else - or doesn't at least have a selectable growth behavior mode or something. Allocating bigger chunks ahead of time usually ends up being both faster AND overall more memory efficient, if you're adding to the collection more than once.",

Learning the basics through Brackey's tutorials. I was making a simple array that would take in a few names, and then output them alphabetically on VSCode. However, for some reason, the Sort function isn't working(Line 25). It keeps saying Array does not contain a definition for Sort, even though I see Brackeys using it in the tutorial. I did the same program using a list, and it works just fine, and the sort function works there, but it isn't working here for some reason. The entire code is made a comment in the other file while working on this one so that there aren't 2 entry points through Main, so I don't think it should make any difference to this code, and the same goes for the Methods.cs file. Can anyone figure out why this might now be working? I tried to look online but I don't see anyone else having this problem",
