Looking for that nudge in the right direction or inspiration to keep going? This is the place for you. Grab a wrench and let's get to work!\n\nWe highly recommend joining our official partner Discord to get live feedback and other tips \u2014 check out the **[Discord of Many Things](https://discord.gg/kkpCaDf)**.\n\nNormal sub rules still apply in the Arcana Forge, with the exception that all restrictions on completeness are lifted here. Unfinished homebrew is very welcome in this thread, as are questions about game rules and mechanics, provided it's about D&D homebrew. \n\nMake a comment with your idea and any work you already have on it, and the community can come help it progress (remember, the more you give the more you get when it comes to content and feedback). \n\n**Please keep the following tips in mind:**\n\n* **Proofread before you post.** People are more likely to engage with you if your comment is clear of obvious spelling mistakes.\n* **Format your post.** If you've got a lot of ideas, break it into paragraphs, use headings, and do what you can to make it easy to read.\n* Making a request or adding to the workshop? Try responding to one too.

            "I've been thinking about the OneDnD Rogue. I like the changes, but IMO it's still just a hair undertuned compared to its peers. I think I have the solution:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n>Reliable Inspiration: Starting at 3rd level, whenever you use (Heroic) Inspiration to reroll a d20 check and the new die roll is 10 or less, you can either count it as a 10, or regain your expended Inspiration.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n>Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a skill check, you gain Inspiration.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThis gives just a slight boost, and it can be used for DPR (attacks), defense (Saving Throws), or skillmonkeying (checks) \u2014 which is I think exactly what the class needs.",
            "The onednd Ranger disappointed me so much that I decided to start working on an old homebrew idea again. What do you guys think of this framework for how a central mark feature works? \n\n**Base Ranger Class** \nd10 hit 1/2 caster ritual casting, 5th lv extra attack, etc (mostly the same)\nCasting mod is Int or Wis(obviously can not be changed)\nMark die\n- probably scales from d4-d10\n- Casting modifier uses per long rest. \n- 1 use back on short rest (2 after 11th)\n- Mark can not be moved when target dies, it's it's just used\n- add die damage to weapon attacks against target.\n\n**Generic Ranger subclass**\n*RP mark*: BA on line of sight (no range) or via Survival, Investigation or Insight checks against the new target last 8 hours\n-  add mark die to corresponding checks and saves against the mark\n\nA catch-all utility class that you can make a detective, a con man, a bounty hunter, or a tracker out of. You pick from feature options like the PHB(2014) Hunter subclass. I want you've to be able to mechanically mark via Scrying or a spyglass.\n\n**Slayer/DPS Subclass\nSlayer Mark via successful attack, you can track it for X hours. Can add mark die to attack rolls but forgoes damage. Ignore difficult terrain to markLv7 reaction AC /save bonus vs. mark.\n\nBased loosely on the quintessential 2014 ranger that took Colossas Slayer and Multiattack Defense. I want it to be the most Ranger Ranger. I'm probably just going to flesh it out with the most common feature from that subclass \n\n**Magus Subclass**\nExpanded Spell list \n*Libra Mark*: BA LOS 60ft?\n- Reveals information about mark, \n- Mark die does (fire, cold, lightening) damage that can be changed as a bonus action, \n- more damage options at higher level\n- You can add ranger die damage to spell damage vs. the mark\n- \n\nThe general caster class. It's supposed to work by finding out the weakness and then directly targeting that weakness. I may change this to an elemental rune theme, but at the moment, it doesn't matter. \n\n**Witch/Hex Subclass**\n Expanded spell list \nHex Mark : BA target makes save(Int, Wis, Cha) vs Hex Mark, on fail, they are hexed for mark die turns, on success only until the end of ranger's next turn.\n- Subtract mark die from specific hexed save?(2 of the same Hexes cannot stack)\n- subtract mark die from specific save?\n- 11th change hex save on long rests (only Int, Cha, Wis)\n\nIt's a witchy debuff themed class, I'm not sure what to do with it. I want it to be able to hex a known weak save and cause a debuff to a different one. Then you can cast a spell that targets the now debuffed save. It's just how to go about it. I'm leaning toward subtracting the mark die to that specific save for the duration of the mark. I'll probably add a bunch of witch themed features to flesh it out.\n\nNone of the levels for features are decided. I'm open to any kind of feedback from criticism of the overall framework, to feature and mark use ideas, or even naming suggestions.\n\nDon't bring up the Beastmaster. I think it should be its own class with a scaling companion that you are literally soul bound to you, none of that found pet nonsense."
