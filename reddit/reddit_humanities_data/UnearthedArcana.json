            "I've been thinking about the OneDnD Rogue. I like the changes, but IMO it's still just a hair undertuned compared to its peers. I think I have the solution:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n>Reliable Inspiration: Starting at 3rd level, whenever you use (Heroic) Inspiration to reroll a d20 check and the new die roll is 10 or less, you can either count it as a 10, or regain your expended Inspiration.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n>Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a skill check, you gain Inspiration.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThis gives just a slight boost, and it can be used for DPR (attacks), defense (Saving Throws), or skillmonkeying (checks) \u2014 which is I think exactly what the class needs.",
            "The onednd Ranger disappointed me so much that I decided to start working on an old homebrew idea again. What do you guys think of this framework for how a central mark feature works? \n\n**Base Ranger Class** \nd10 hit 1/2 caster ritual casting, 5th lv extra attack, etc (mostly the same)\nCasting mod is Int or Wis(obviously can not be changed)\nMark die\n- probably scales from d4-d10\n- Casting modifier uses per long rest. \n- 1 use back on short rest (2 after 11th)\n- Mark can not be moved when target dies, it's it's just used\n- add die damage to weapon attacks against target.\n\n**Generic Ranger subclass**\n*RP mark*: BA on line of sight (no range) or via Survival, Investigation or Insight checks against the new target last 8 hours\n-  add mark die to corresponding checks and saves against the mark\n\nA catch-all utility class that you can make a detective, a con man, a bounty hunter, or a tracker out of. You pick from feature options like the PHB(2014) Hunter subclass. I want you've to be able to mechanically mark via Scrying or a spyglass.\n\n**Slayer/DPS Subclass\nSlayer Mark via successful attack, you can track it for X hours. Can add mark die to attack rolls but forgoes damage. Ignore difficult terrain to markLv7 reaction AC /save bonus vs. mark.\n\nBased loosely on the quintessential 2014 ranger that took Colossas Slayer and Multiattack Defense. I want it to be the most Ranger Ranger. I'm probably just going to flesh it out with the most common feature from that subclass \n\n**Magus Subclass**\nExpanded Spell list \n*Libra Mark*: BA LOS 60ft?\n- Reveals information about mark, \n- Mark die does (fire, cold, lightening) damage that can be changed as a bonus action, \n- more damage options at higher level\n- You can add ranger die damage to spell damage vs. the mark\n- \n\nThe general caster class. It's supposed to work by finding out the weakness and then directly targeting that weakness. I may change this to an elemental rune theme, but at the moment, it doesn't matter. \n\n**Witch/Hex Subclass**\n Expanded spell list \nHex Mark : BA target makes save(Int, Wis, Cha) vs Hex Mark, on fail, they are hexed for mark die turns, on success only until the end of ranger's next turn.\n- Subtract mark die from specific hexed save?(2 of the same Hexes cannot stack)\n- subtract mark die from specific save?\n- 11th change hex save on long rests (only Int, Cha, Wis)\n\nIt's a witchy debuff themed class, I'm not sure what to do with it. I want it to be able to hex a known weak save and cause a debuff to a different one. Then you can cast a spell that targets the now debuffed save. It's just how to go about it. I'm leaning toward subtracting the mark die to that specific save for the duration of the mark. I'll probably add a bunch of witch themed features to flesh it out.\n\nNone of the levels for features are decided. I'm open to any kind of feedback from criticism of the overall framework, to feature and mark use ideas, or even naming suggestions.\n\nDon't bring up the Beastmaster. I think it should be its own class with a scaling companion that you are literally soul bound to you, none of that found pet nonsense."

            "Hi everyone.\n\nAre you tired of your cute little zombies being outclassed by skeletons in both damage and utility? Want your enemies to bleed from every orifice and your allies to look at you in absolute disgust?\n\nSay hello to your new best friend: bioterrorism.\n\nI was thinking on how to make zombies a little more relevant (considering that animating skeletons is usually a superior choice), and decided to make use of the fact that they ARE fleshy to give them the very flavorful addition of diseases. I've always thought that *Contagion* was pretty cool, so I've slapped it on a zombie and called it a day.\n\nThis spell is a little hard to judge balance-wise, as a permanently repeatable Contagion (without the poisoned part) is certaintly strong, but the vector of transmission is via a zombie, you know, the very mortal 22 HP / 8 AC / +3 to hit powerhouse (remember that the zombie IS affected by the disease, maybe using *Mindfire* isn't a good idea), so I think that the spell is fine? Keep in mind that the creature being attacked by the zombie can only be affected by this spell once, so even if you had multiple zombies whaling on a boss it would only be affected by the first one that landed a hit (and they would become immune to future attempts after being affected).\n\nThe true duration of the spell is how long can you keep the zombie alive (and you would be lucky if the zombie makes it through the day), but at least it will become a relevant piece in combat.\n\nAs a sidenote, this is an amazing spell for NPCs. Imagine confidently going agains a pack of zombies and one of them hits you with *Slimy Doom*. Although very brief (5 rounds at most, and you become immune afterwards), it's guaranteed to freak out your players (and the paladin will be having a field day).\n\nAs with all my other spells, I'd give access to this spell to any necromancy-related subclass, including warlocks and wizards.\n\nIf you have an appetite for more necromancy spells, take a look at my previous compilation: [Tome of Necromancy](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/vuebpt/tome_of_necromancy_scratch_all_of_your/), or check out my previous spell, [Woeful Knell](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/194trw4/woeful_knell_detect_corpses_and_grant_line_of/).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
            "If you are curious about the name of the spell, take a look at the [Yersinia pestis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death).",
            "Concept wise this spell is really interesting, taking the fact that contagion is a natural disease and having zombies spread it is a cool concept. \n\nBalance wise this spell is super OP. (essentially removing the hardest parts of inflicting contagen and replacing it with a much easier condition to apply). Zombies are deceptively tanky with the possibility to be a real brick wall with undead fortitude with their only real drawback being lacklustre damage compared to other summons. Popping this on a zombie effectively gives them pleanty of time to deal encounter ending attacks (via slimy doom, Flesh rot or even seizure) as 1d4+1 rounds is essentially an entire combat in 5e. Monsters with low int will more than likely see your front line dealing shiploads of damage as more of a threat than your zombie until it's too late. \n\nTo remedy this, probably have the contagion last 1 round so an enemy isn't crippled by this since you're not sacrificing going into Melee as a spellcaster or a 3 turn investment. One turn of a contagion effect is still incredibly strong (a Stun or vulnerability to everything for a whole round).",
            "Just an addendum, I didn't read that they're immune for 24 hours even after they take the effect so if you feel that the change is too underpowered for a 5th level spell you could mabye remove that.\n\nOtherwise great conceptual spell I love it :)",
            "After giving it some thought I have to agree that the duration is a bit excessive. I think that considering the diseases available, having it last until the end of the creature's next turn would be preferable, to guarantee value on *Filth Fever*, *Seizure* and *Mindfire*. \n\nSpeaking of *Mindfire*, I was thinking on maybe making the zombies be unaffected by the diseases they carry, since some of the effects are a bit too severe and work against the spell in unfun ways (half of the diseases make it harder to land a hit and the other half makes the zombie a bit too frail).\n\nRegarding the last point, I don't think that the immunity after suffering the effect is too important, but it is unintuitive compared to the rest of spells, and to be honest if an enemy at level 9 is hit twice by with a +3 to hit and fails a Constitution saving throw twice they kinda deserve to be dead, so maybe I'll remove the immunity on a failure. \n\nIn short:\n\n* The zombie is unaffected by the disease they carry\n* The creature being hit that fails the save is only afflicted until the end of their next turn\n* The creature doesn't gain immunity to the spell if they fail the save\n\nWith these changes the zombies should have an easier time landing the hit, but the payoff is reduced. How does that sound?",
            "I would argue that rather than being effected until the end of *their* next turn, make it until the end of *your* next turn, that gives party members a more reliable way to take advantage of the effect, especially if I\u2019m gonna be blowing a 5th level spell slot\n\nI don\u2019t wanna hit a baddie just for their turn to come right after mine, then they\u2019re fine and the paladin can\u2019t super smite them because of a bad initiative order\n\nThough I\u2019ll admit, spell effects are usually based on the targets turn while class abilities are your own turn, so this design is fine as is, I just love being a spell caster who combos with burst damage dealers",
            "Those changes sound pretty good, reducing pay-off for easier activation will definitely help players feel like the spell is doing something which is one of the biggest issues with contagion (since you only get any real tangible effect after 3 turns).\n\nI'm interested to see which spell lists this goes into though because it seems like a wizard spell cuz zombies but also contagion is a druid/cleric spell.\n\nCool spell though man hope you have many more amazing ideas like this \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Well, worst-case scenario you can just order the zombies to ready an action (attack the target once its turn is over) to cheat the initiative order"

            "With the disappointing release from WoTC 2024 Ranger today, I felt inspired to continue my \"Closing the Martial/Caster Divide\" project since it will clearly still be an issue in the 2024 PHB. This homebrew probably feels a bit too strong compared to 2014 PHB versions of martials, but I hope it will compare to 5e Casters more than any of the 2014 martial. My goal with the Ranger is to bring in all of the best aspects from all sorts of sources (2014, 2024, various UAs, BG3, and even Pathfinder) to create the definitive Ranger experience.\n\nAs an additional note, if you would like to adapt this content to fit 2024 game you can just add the Weapon Masteries feature that Rangers get from the new PHB at second level."
