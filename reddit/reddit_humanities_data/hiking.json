            "A shoe cannot be breathable and waterproof at the same time. I love my Merrels because when my feet get wet in them, they dry in no time at all. You don't want waterproof hiking footwear for regular use, it can lead to foot fungus.",
            "I hunt in Merrel Moab 3s Mids and walk through streams and have never gotten wet socks unless the water comes over the top. I\u2019ve got 2 pair and my oldest have 3 or 4 seasons on them.",
            "Their leather boots are the only Merrell I have that are actually waterproof, unless you're me and you shove your leg in a creek under a snow drift",

            "It looks like your pants have water on them as well - so it probably got in from the top",
            "The title makes me feel you know why your toes are wet but you don't want to share the truth.",
            "Think about it. How can something be breathable and water proof? Those two things are opposites.\nGore-tex is a lie."

            "Oh yeah, but you have to have the right conditions, that's for sure.  In the winter months, avalanche danger is usually high and the right conditions will happen on just a few days now and then.  But any year that gets enough snow, you can ski down gullies from a little way below the summit in the late spring and early summer quite safely, as long as you're done by late morning, before the sun warms the snowpack up too much.  Did you climb up from Yankee Boy Basin?  The gully that you climb in the last few hundred feet of that route is skiable in the spring some years, but due to its south facing aspect, it gets melted out early."
