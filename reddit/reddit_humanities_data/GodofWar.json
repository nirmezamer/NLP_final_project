He could even predict Kratos\u2019, before he could throw enough Draupnir spears. \n\nBut, we see that when Thor shows up to stop him from bullying Atreus he backs off and doesn\u2019t even think to fight him. \n\nThor is the only god that Heimdall fears, simply because, as we\u2019ve seen, Thor doesn\u2019t think. Thor doesn\u2019t think much before he acts and just makes up his next movements randomly. He doesn\u2019t even go to deep thinking. So Heimdall cannot easily predict his movements. Odin himself said \u201cI think, you kill!\u201d \n\nThor even tells him \u201cLook, into my eyes. You tell me\u2026\u201d is like telling \u201cTry to predict my movements, now let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got\u201d \n\nSo if Heimdall\u2019s power is to predict the thoughts, he has nothing to predict from Thor.

            "Thor being drunk around 80% of the time really doesn't help either",
            "Heimdall beats his opponents by reading their thoughts. Thors mantra throughout this game is No thinking!",
            "Heimdall, replies back You are a sick man, so he must be thinking something. I figured he was thinking of something absurd like pulling his entrails out his a$$ and then forcing them down his throat.",
            "When the dude has the reputation of \"biggest butchering bastard in the nine realms\", giant slayer and vanir public enemy numero uno. And the man who laid kratos stiff only to revive him to kick his ass some more, id walk away too. Like if this fat mofo had the same mental fortitude as kratos. Theres literally no one that could physically stop him. To put that into perspective, giants as big as the greek titans would rather run away than face this fat fuck, hes literally as small as an ant compared to them but that doesnt stop him swinging his hammer and blowing their skulls and knee caps up. Odin himself was purposely treating him like a dummy to prevent thor from realizing he could just walk away with his family and any mofo that tries to harm them would just get folded. This mofo is so dangerously unstable when drunk that he made a crater in vanaheim and doesnt even remember it, morethan that he slapped the world serpent so hard he broke physics. Straight up just sent the snake to another timeline. Heimdal is morethan lucky he died at kratos hand. Thor would have done morethan just choke him to death if he knew heimdal hit thrud in helheim lol",
            "Also because Thor's lightning powers are random. Heimdall could predict when he's going to strike, but not how. Which is what happened in his fight with Kratos. Kratos didnt \"clear his mind\", he just threw enough Draupnir spears (which detonate in a random order) so that Heimdall could lose focus and stop dodging his hits.",
            "In the scene with Heimdall and Thrud, Heimdall says everyone takes it easy on you cause they are afraid of your father and then says he isnt but he clearly is. I think Thor was likely the most feared god or one of the most feared in the Norse pantheon, hence Heimdall himself being Afraid of him.",
            "I think its mostly because he knows how fucking strong he is. Also thor when he hits he will predicit it but thor has ligthming goos luck predicting that and accually dogde",
            "Id also like to point that Thor is a god damn tank so what could Heimdall do that could possibly cause him any serious damage? Well maybe Bifrost attacks would work but Kratos punched Thor with full power at the end of their first fight and Thor just laughted it off.\n\nAnd during their second time Thor tanked *a lot of damage* before actually going down. I know Odin one shotted him but Odin is a special case and his spear is unique and a very powerful weapon.",

He gets it waxed once a week, its soft, its fluffy, and it can squirt. Oh, can it ever squirt. The main reason we never really see this weapon is because it would just make the games too boring. Theres actually a deleted segment in Ragnarok where Thor hurls Mjolnir at Kratos with full force and his pussy simply catches it, covers it in girlcum, and squirts it back at Thor, cracking one of his ribs. I hope its expanded on in the next game, if we end up getting one.",
