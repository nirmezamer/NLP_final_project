        "content": "Heimdall, no matter how strong he is, practically fears no one because he can actually predict their next movements. He could even predict Kratos\u2019, before he could throw enough Draupnir spears. \n\nBut, we see that when Thor shows up to stop him from bullying Atreus he backs off and doesn\u2019t even think to fight him. \n\nThor is the only god that Heimdall fears, simply because, as we\u2019ve seen, Thor doesn\u2019t think. Thor doesn\u2019t think much before he acts and just makes up his next movements randomly. He doesn\u2019t even go to deep thinking. So Heimdall cannot easily predict his movements. Odin himself said \u201cI think, you kill!\u201d \n\nThor even tells him \u201cLook, into my eyes. You tell me\u2026\u201d is like telling \u201cTry to predict my movements, now let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got\u201d \n\nSo if Heimdall\u2019s power is to predict the thoughts, he has nothing to predict from Thor.

            "Heimdall, replies back \u201cYou are a sick man\u201d, so he must be thinking something. I figured he was thinking of something absurd like pulling his entrails out his a$$ and then forcing them down his throat.",
            "When the dude has the reputation of \"biggest butchering bastard in the nine realms\", giant slayer and vanir public enemy numero uno. And the man who laid kratos stiff only to revive him to kick his ass some more, id walk away too. Like if this fat mofo had the same mental fortitude as kratos. Theres literally no one that could physically stop him. To put that into perspective, giants as big as the greek titans would rather run away than face this fat fuck, hes literally as small as an ant compared to them but that doesnt stop him swinging his hammer and blowing their skulls and knee caps up. Odin himself was purposely treating him like a dummy to prevent thor from realizing he could just walk away with his family and any mofo that tries to harm them would just get folded. This mofo is so dangerously unstable when drunk that he made a crater in vanaheim and doesnt even remember it, morethan that he slapped the world serpent so hard he broke physics. Straight up just sent the snake to another timeline. Heimdal is morethan lucky he died at kratos hand. Thor would have done morethan just choke him to death if he knew heimdal hit thrud in helheim lol",
            "Also because Thor's lightning powers are random. Heimdall could predict when he's going to strike, but not how. Which is what happened in his fight with Kratos. Kratos didn\u2019t \"clear his mind\", he just threw enough Draupnir spears (which detonate in a random order) so that Heimdall could lose focus and stop dodging his hits.",
            "In the scene with Heimdall and Thrud, Heimdall says \u201ceveryone takes it easy on you cause they are afraid of your father\u201d and then says he isn\u2019t but he clearly is. I think Thor was likely the most feared god or one of the most feared in the Norse pantheon, hence Heimdall himself being Afraid of him.",
            "I think its mostly because he knows how fucking strong he is. Also thor when he hits he will predicit it but thor has ligthming goos luck predicting that and accually dogde",
            "Id also like to point that Thor is a god damn tank so what could Heimdall do that could possibly cause him any serious damage? Well maybe Bifrost attacks would work but Kratos punched Thor with full power at the end of their first fight and Thor just laughted it off.\n\nAnd during their second time Thor tanked *a lot of damage* before actually going down. I know Odin one shotted him but Odin is a special case and his spear is unique and a very powerful weapon.",

        "content": "For starters, I\u2019ve seen people say that Hercules is one of the less powerful/weakest god of war characters, I\u2019ve seen people say he can be beaten by like Baldur, Heimdall, Thor(though not think Thor may be able to beat him but that\u2019s not my point) The thing is, Hercules is literally the strongest god of war character in the universe as far as physical/raw strength, with him literally being known for his strength and him being the literal god of strength, though it\u2019s unknown if he ever reached his godhood in the god of war universe, someone may have to correct me on that, but he\u2019s literally worshipped for his strength (i think). In Greek mythology he\u2019s second to Zeus in strength (or that may have been Poseidon but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Hercules and he\u2019s also I\u2019m quite sure stronger than Kratos in physical strength, I mean he literally picked him up during they\u2019re fight, and besides he literally has the nemean cestus, one of like the most goated weapons, anyone who played gow 3 could potentially agree with that, to add on something it says that Hercules proved to be a difficult challenge for Kratos even with all the weapons and magic he had by that point. Anyway I know you guys hate powerscaling, this was just a rant as to why I think Hercules is like pretty underestimated in gow, what do yall think? ",

            "After recently replaying god of war 3 it got me wondering why was kratos chosen to kill Aries when Hercules was right there do you think Hercules could have killed Aries",
            "Because his fight is underwhelming? He's supposed to be absurdly strong but his biggest feat on screen is struggling to lift a concrete floor, if he's so powerful lore wise, I want to see it, if I'm facing a being supposed to be the representation of strength I want his bossfight to decimate landscapes, send Kratos flying into the sky with punches, create earthquakes that transform forests into devasted pieces of land.\n\nYou know what bossfight has that? Baldur's bossfight, I'm not saying necessarily that he's stronger than Hercules lore wise, but the game definitely does a way better work at depicting his strength, in a possible remake, I hope they do even better with Hercules, but for now, he doesn't *seems* or *feels* stronger than many of these characters (not saying he isn't, but the direction of the game doesn't show it in a good way).\n\nIt is expected that people that aren't that much into the lore won't consider him to be too much of a threat, also, I don't think bringing the mythology adds much to it, but using his off screen feats can be useful to scale him.",
            "Think the reason is that he is just unmemorable really, he has no presence outside of his appearance as a boss fight. Thor for instance has presence all the way through GoW just by us repeatedly hearing stories about him... and even after he is gone, he is still there sort of through his legacy in Thrud. Herc however just shows up, we smash his face, and watch his dead body float away in a sewer and we are give no more thought about him than that until he gets his Valhalla mention.\n\nIt ofc doesn't help him that the fight we have with him isn't exactly the stuff of legends.",
            "Hercules fought on pair with Kratos after he took Hades soul. He would only be weaker than Kratos, Zeus, and Athena after she ascended.",
            "Because kratos beat his fucken ass",
            "Feats wise Kratos definitely is the strongest physically in verse (lifting all 9 realms). Also saying Thor \u201cmay be able to beat him\u201d is pretty massive understatement. Baldur knocked out the world serpent Jormangandr with 3 punches and I\u2019m not entirely confident in Hercules putting it down knowing the trouble it gave Thor in their first fight. I don\u2019t see any Hercules feats that put him above either Thor or Baldur and using real world mythology to scale him doesn\u2019t work. I think the general consensus is that the high tiers in GoW Greece (Zues, Kronos, Thanatos) are stronger than the high tiers in GoW Norse (Odin, Thor, Surtur) but the lower tiers of both worlds seem to be on the same level. A fight like Hercules vs a Valkyrie would be more fair.",
            "Damn I can't believe people are downplaying him that bad while definitely just a demi god in God of war dude was still no slouch and would probably place somewhere in the top ten fighters of the Greek saga though I can't say for certain where he ranks",
            "Hercules died because he was cocky and dumb, he could of won everytime he used his Nemean Cestus stun lock him and finish the job but instead he walked away to gloat towards Hera on how Kratos looks while he is stunned.\nThe entire fight he was extremely cocky and prideful and started the fight thinking the legionnaire's would be enough.\n\n\nPride Killed the beast.",
            "Lack of Feats and Good showing, Kratos actually struggle against other opponents and straight up lost to some \n\nHercules doesn't have any of this plus his rage over Kratos was more realistic than a Cool badass one like Zeus or Thor",
