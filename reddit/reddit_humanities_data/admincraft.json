I've been thinking of selfhosting the server on an old office PC that I have, but I wanted to make sure first that it would be suitable.\n\nThe relevant specs are as follows:\n\nCPU: i5-4590\n\nMEM: 8GB DDR3-1600\n\nSTORAGE: 500GB HDD\n\nNETWORK: Not sure exactly, but I get around 125Mbps down and 35 Mbps up with relatively low latency on 2.4GHz wifi, so an Ethernet connection should probably be fine.\n\n\nThe server would have around 20 players, but realistically, probably only around half of that online at any moment, at maximum.\n\n\nI haven't yet finished deciding what mods will be used, but it wouldn't be that heavy - maybe ~100-150 mods, ~200 at most. A large portion would just be optimization mods, various small mods e.g. the likes of Traveler's Backpack and a small selection of large mods e.g. Create.\n\n\nI am planning on pregenerating the world. The biggest worry for me is that 8GB of memory might not be enough to load the modpack and all chunks while many players are online, and I definitely don't want to be swapping to a HDD. I could add another 8GB stick if necessary.\n\n\nOpinions? Is this realistic or am I overestimating the capability of this hardware?   ",

Having said that, you can run with less ram easily. My GTNH server with 2 players for instance is still fine with only 2.5gb allocated to the server. \nHaving said that\u00b2, ddr3 memory should be dirt cheap, and might improve performance due to additional file caching. Speaking of file caching, the server can also profit from a cheap ssd.\nWhen you notice that the server tps drop, or gets close to 50ms/t, you can alwas reduce the render/simulation distance.",
            "\u00a0 Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Nice to hear that relatively large modpacks like GTNH can run with constrained RAM, but I do think Minecraft itself used much less in 1.7.10. I'll probably just try it regardless and find another 8gb in the meantime.\u00a0 As for an SSD, that's definitely worth thinking about. I did originally think it might not be worth it due to the small playerbase, but it probably could function better as swap memory too.\u00a0 \u00a0"
