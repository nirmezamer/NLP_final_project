            "I am just doing my first infographic using drawings.google.com, and for some reason whenever I export as jpg or png it never becomes in focus like it does when it is on the web or as a .pdf\n\nThe drawing looks great when viewing 100% in my browser, but once exported into one of those two image formats it's like a complete layer of subtle blur has applied to the entire document (both image + text)\n\nAny idea what I am doing wrong or anything to check?",

            "I mean there was always a gap. It\u2019s not like America caught up and then passed the others",
            "All this chart is telling me is that in the US, income inequality is going to get worse and worker exploitation is going to get worse and probably nothing will improve in the housing market or healthcare",
            "America\u2019s economic strength and overall wealth is just insane. It accounts for 1/4 of world output. Mints the global reserve currency. Dominates all technology sectors destined for future economic growth, as well as scientific research, and corporate R&D (with only China as a credible competitor). Basically all developed, wealthy countries are garrisoned protectorates of the U.S. military and in any case enthralled to American culture and soft power.\n\nThis has all the hallmarks of a *1000 year Reich*. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a thousand years from now terms like CENTCOM might be used as geographical descriptors without anyone remembering their origins as imperial military districts, like happened with \u201cAfrica\u201d and the Roman Empire.",

            "UK is up thanks to the new londongrad residents taking up shop while some 'drama' happens near the EU",
            "Do you see that decline in Japan, this was the yen depreciating, however the Japanese economy has been the second best on a per capita basis of all the above\n\nWhy doesn't it look like it? Because nominal gdp fluctuates significantly due to currency exchanges",
            "This is GDP at current prices, this is heavily influenced by exchange rates and different inflations across borders. USD was very strong through the high inflation period as global money flower to US bonds when interest rates started rising along with geopolitical risk. Japanese Yen for example lost a third of its value vs the USD between 2021 and 2024 which is the biggest reason there's a huge drop recorded. But if one adjusts for local living costs (which aren't gonna jump up and down hugely every time exchange rates change) and calculate based on a constant USD from a certain year, Japan's GDP grew relatively strongly from 2021 to 2025.",
            "That is a massive gap even today. However a better measure would be average income.",

            "A lot of nouveau rich from asia took their money to these places, post 2008. Expensive property became exceedingly more expensive over a 15 year period. Europe is also looking unaffordable because it's bought up by the same people. Hong Kong was the first place money was parked because it was easiest to shift it there. The big western banks and financial institutions in Hong Kong help move the money overseas to aforementioned places - hence the title of \"money laundering capital\" of the East.",
            "This infographic only looks at 8 countries, and while I think the way it presents itself is slightly misleading, nowhere does it claim to be showing the \"least affordable in the world\" like OPs title does. \n\nOP, I think you should probably delete and repost this with corrected title.",
            "Mumbai is definitely missing from this list.",
            "So pretty much all the largest cities on the California coast.\n\nOn another note, when my brother once tried to sell his house in SoCal, had a native Hawaiian family come and look at it. They\u2019re getting priced out their own land. It\u2019s fucked.",
            "Crazy how most of these could be fixed by punting nimbys, fixing zoning laws, and putting caps on foreign investment. Even crazier NYC and Singapore are suspiciously absent."
