            "If I unlock a combat achievement tier, claim the hilt / rewards, and then new bosses are released down the line and I fall out of my tier do I keep the rewards? I know I\u2019ll still have the hilt in my bank but would the clue scroll odds improvement and other things still be active?",
            "So as I've been AFKing ammonite crabs on my iron, I've been collecting unidentified fossils whenever I happen to look over at my 2nd monitor and see them on the ground without knowing what they actually do. I finally looked it up and found out that they can be turned into quite a bit of prayer xp, but I need calcyte and pyrophosphite for that process. Problem is, I haven't been collecting these at all. What's a good way for an iron to farm these items?",
            "Am i correct in reading that if i am able to catch an impling bare handed, there is no point in the magic net?",
            "If I want to retain my slayer streak, is the most efficient way of getting points doing the easiest master through tasks 1-9 then doing konar on the 10th, or spamming Duradel? Max combat, will use cannon, etc.",
            "I have a lot of portal rooms and portals already, so I don\u2019t feel like adding very basic ones like Varrock etc. so I can use NPC contact for mahogany homes on my iron. I\u2019m 71 now, have 85+ banked. Have done high construction a few times and 99 once but early to mid game mahogany homes confuses me. I reckon you just rough it with regular spellbook and teleport to Falador for Amy in person til 83-85ish to make an almost max POH then? Or could some Jewelry box soon benefit me? Seems lame to rough it but at the same time it\u2019s also rather fast to grind out the 12-15 or so levels and just max out my POH. Any tips, tricks, or advice on the matter?",
            "No. When the required points for a tier change with a new set of CA's being released, you will lose all perks of  the tier that you fall out of. This includes clue increases, god wards kc, cannon capacity, and usage of hilts/helms.",
            "You\u2019ll have to re-earn it, otherwise people could have a zuk helm without all the tasks done",
            "No, if you fall out of a CA tier, you lose those rewards. They stay in your bank, but you can't interact with the items outside of withdrawing, depositing, and dropping. If you attach your hilt to your avernic, you'll have to unattach it to use your avernic.",
            "For gp? No, it's not worth it in the slightest.\n\nFor experience? Absolutely. If you're having trouble making prep time in regular gauntlet, CG is going to be way too fast for you. Keep doing regular gauntlet until you can at least make the CG prep time. Then switch over to CG to actually make some money.",
            "CG will be immensely rough with those stats, so I wouldn't recommend it. Instead you'd probably be better served by other midgame content, like wildy bosses or perilous moons. Make sure you're doing your herb runs as well because they really do add up over time"

            "Extremely disappointed by this proposal\u2026I think we were all expecting drain rate to improve as agility is leveled. Which i guess it does, but at the cost of a huge nerf to any sort of pvm or activity that requires gear and/or resources of significant weight? \n\nCan this proposal be reworked in a way so that it\u2019s not super punishing please?",
            "Making drain rate even more heavily dependent on weight is only going to make graceful more important to wear. Removing the 30% increased regen rate from Graceful isn\u2019t a way to make Graceful less of a requirement, it\u2019s a way to \u201cbalance\u201d Graceful since the run energy changes are going to make it even more important.\n\nAll of these changes feel like nerfs disguised as buffs.",
            "DO NOT MAKE DRAIN RATES WITH HEAVY GEAR ANY WORSE THAN THEY ARE NOW!!!!",
            "How is it possible to miss the mark this bad? Really feels like they've throw random numbers at it without testing it once.\n\nIn max gear solo olm will require like 3-4 stams now which is bonkers",
            "So for people running around in raiding gear, the run energy problem is getting worse?",
            "Man imagine running rooftops for over 200 hours and your run will deplete even faster than it does today... This run energy update should be a net positive in every single aspect because currently, quite frankly, its dogshit.",
            "I thought 99 agility would finally be VERY rewarding and significant, but with this proposal 99 agility drain rate will be worse in some cases. What",
            "Just please don't make content feel worse to play. If you're gonna touch run energy at all it needs to feel better at all levels. Not worse. Otherwise I wouldn't want you guys changing anything else because you will be okay with changes making gameplay feel worse.",
            "When I read that higher agility will offset the drain rate I was imagining something along the lines that 99 agility will give you a permanent 32kg weight reduction. So at 99 agility and with 64kg or higher weight only 32kg actually gets used for the drain rate. This would make changing drain rate at all not really needed, could remove the weight reduction on graceful entirely, would still give ring of endurance and stams their place in the game and make high agility actually feel rewarding. Keep the regen rate buffs and boom everyones happy.",
            "So the rebalancing youre suggesting is making literally everything worse except for when you're running naked/no weight. This is horrible and not what we asked for. It's supposed to get better or stay the same, not get worse. How can you be so out of touch with your game and it's community?\u00a0"

Or why we\u2019re trying to make someone with level 1 agility at zero weight have the same drain rate as someone with level 99. \n\nMake the skill rewarding.

What about certain skilling activities like Herbiboar or Blast Furnace? What about wilderness activities?\u201d\n\nBuff them. That\u2019s right\u2014we want Agility buffed. That\u2019s what we\u2019re asking for. In order to address the issues mentioned\u2014making the skill more rewarding, and stamina less tedious to manage\u2014it requires buffing it.

            "Yeah it\u2019s pretty simple and everyone is trying to overcomplicate it by wanting resting spots and this and that. Just make it so each however many levels lets you run for % longer and increase the current run time by 30 seconds from level 1/f2p. Replenish rate could be buffed as well as you level. That\u2019s all we want.\u00a0\n\nWe don\u2019t need trade offs, just make the skill feel rewarding to train.
