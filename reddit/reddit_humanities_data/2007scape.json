While I only gave it one attempt I don't really have the funds to keep trying so think i'll just give up and come back with better gear and stats, mostly unlocking Blood Blitz as it also saves a inventory slot due to costing 2 different runes instead of 3.\n\nHonestly did not expect to get this far as a new player lol.\n\nAm going to go back to doing quests by release date, meaning unlocking barrows gloves and such as well, planning to do mage training arena because I want to train magic, unlock gear, but keep my hp level low.\n\nIf there is any niche gear or such that could help as a ironman I love to know.",

            "Just throwing this in here after reporting it in-game a while ago.\n\n[On May 23rd an update was made to change normal-mode ToB Verzik p2 to scale for solo play](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/minigame-tweaks-skilling-adjustments--more?oldschool=1). Basically two changes if there's only one player still alive.\n\n1. Only one red crab spawns (instead of two). This makes it possible to out-dps Verzik's healing.\n\n2. The zap damage is capped from ~50 down to 14. This makes tick-eating zaps not always necessary.\n\n\\#1 works properly but #2 is bugged. In a solo ToB it functions properly, but if the raid was not initially a solo, it doesn't scale down. The zap continues to hit between 45-50 even with only one player still alive.\n\nThis actually makes duo tobs where one player dies on Verzik *harder* than solos, because you still have to kill Verzik by yourself, but through all of p2 you also have to deal with zaps taking 50% of your hp with no counterplay. Unless your 2nd player dies right at the end of p2.5, it's basically impossible to clear since people don't typically bring sweets for non-solo ToBs and the only real option you have is to tick eat with brews, which are both a limited resource and massively drop your dps. So while the changes properly made solos less annoying, they didn't actually improve the situation where someone in a duo dies, making Verzik entirely uncompletable.\n\nTo reproduce this, do a duo and have one player die during p2 Verzik. Note that the zap is still hitting 45-50 damage. This does not occur when doing a solo ToB.",
