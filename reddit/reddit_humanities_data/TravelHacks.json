Our flight tickets were generously gifted by a friend who has an event there, so we're excited to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nWe're looking for budget-friendly ways to visit Masai Mara and explore other parts of Kenya. We noticed that the Masai Mara entry fee has increased by 2.5x, so we're wondering if it's ideal to visit for 1 or 2 days to get the best experience. Any recommendations for affordable accommodations, transportation, tours, and must-visit places would be greatly appreciated!\n\nIt would also be great if someone could provide more details about the recent changes in the entry fees and how to make the most of our visit despite the increase.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

            "I lived there 2006/2007 so I don\u2019t know all the details anymore. But my recommendation would definitely be at least two days depending on where in the park you go. The weather can be bad or the wildlife might be less active so it\u2019s always good to have a backup day. Also the feeling of waking up in the savanna, I absolutely loved it.\n\nIm thinking of Kilimanjaro, it\u2019s so much more expensive than Mount Kenya even if the later is much more beautiful. Just because it is the highest. The same applies here. Massai Mara is the most famous one and therefore they charge more because everyone goes there. But there are many other great parks as well, like tsavo. My favourite was Amboseli, however as far as I remember it was also quite pricy. Btw nairobi have a city national park which is easy accessible and not to expensive. So don\u2019t lock your self on just masai mara",
