            "Im pretty terrible at sleeping on planes. The only way I can SORT OF sleep is by doing a lot of activity the day before, taking a dramamine, wearing noise cancelling headphones and listening to something boring, rolling up a turkish towel and putting it behind my neck, and not having anything under the seat in front of me. Being able to cross my arms and stretch my legs helps a ton. But even then, its not always guaranteed for me.",

            "I don't. My secret is to lightly doze, I wear ear planes, a headband/headphone thing that covers my eyes, and a hoodie. I put in eye drops before takeoff and keep my eyes closed as much as possible. It helps me not feel as crappy, especially for red eyes.\n\nEdited to add: I have anxiety and chronic insomnia, I have never slept well outside of an actual bed in my life. I don't even nap unless I'm super sick. So I just kind of \"rest\" for the duration of the flight.",

            "I make sure Im tired the night before so I have no choice but succumb to the fatigue. Its going to be horrible but unless Im in first class sleeping on a plane is quite inconvenient. I also take advantage and start adjusting to the time zone difference.",

            "it depends. booking agencys from skyscanner will usually give the cheapest option but booking directly with the airline is the most consistent. you need to decide if you would prefer the extra security booking direct gives you or would you like 20 euro less from booking who can be hard to reach in an emergency",
