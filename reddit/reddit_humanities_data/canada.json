            "I cannot understand  how any politician can stand there and pretend to give hope or make excuses for the reality that an educated, upper middle class worker cannot even dream of a house in either Toronto or Vancouver or their suburbs. \n\nDo they understand that a 4-6,000 mortgage = one person\u2019s pay?",

            "A country is \"broken\" when its system of checks and balances has eroded to the point where its internal correction mechanisms are no longer capable of detecting, controlling, and removing bad actors, whether those actors are corporations, concentrations of financial interest, foreign influences, or political grifters.  By that standard, Canada is not broken, but it is breaking.",

            "The French government is almost certainly going to fall next week. And refusing or being unable to control immigration and migration is going to be one of the major reasons. the British government is going to follow shortly thereafter for the exact same root cause. The German government is in trouble for the same reason. The people all over Europe are turning further and further to the right because they can't get centrists to do anything to stop the flood of migrants. This flood will have a major impact on the American election down south, as well. Trump is likely to get in again in large part because of it.\n\nAnd still, Trudeau stubbornly refuses to even consider slowing immigration. Which will crush his party come the next election.",
