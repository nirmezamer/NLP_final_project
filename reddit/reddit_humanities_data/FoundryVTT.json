We've put thousands of hours of development effort into delivering a significant iteration that improves on nearly every aspect of the software.\n\nKey areas of focus for us included the addition of Scene Regions and triggered events, a comprehensive update to the capabilities of our canvas rendering framework, the addition of ApplicationV2 which begins a new era to the way that we present UI elements, powerful features to customize Scene Ambience, enhancements to dice rolling, and much more. Read the [V12 Stable Highlights](https://foundryvtt.com/releases/12.324/#update-highlights) section of our release notes for a more complete summary of what Version 12 brings to Foundry VTT!\n\nIMPORTANT: While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss.\n\n# For Package Developers\n\nFor our community developers who are considering updating modules or systems to support version 12, please review the list of [V12 Breaking Changes](https://github.com/orgs/foundryvtt/projects/42/views/9) and refer to several open [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/discussions) for documentation of significant V12 changes, and our [API documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/api/) updated for V12.\n\nFor our community of users, please be patient and understanding of the developers of your favorite systems and modules and allow them time to provide support for V12 as their own schedules permit. Please practice appreciation for the exceptional effort our dev community volunteers. \ud83c\udf7b\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\n# [Update Notes](https://foundryvtt.com/releases/12.324)\n\n**Download**: From the Foundry VTT website [https://foundryvtt.com/me/licenses](https://foundryvtt.com/me/licenses)\n\n",

            "I love Foundry and I'm about to potentially make a go at paid GMing, which wouldn't be possible without such a fully featured and modable VTT, alongside the hard work of a lot of very talented volunteers who bujild and maintain the systems.",

            "I remember a while back there was the idea that in conjunction with v12, there would also be a v11.5 with an update check. Is this v11.5 still a thing or was the plan dropped on the way?"

How to help others help you!\n\n---\n\n1) The **Foundry ecosystem** is split into several communities:\n\n* [The official FoundryVTT Discord server](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) - operated by Foundry staff and hand-picked moderators, this server is the official gathering spot for Foundry users. \n* /r/FoundryVTT - you are here! This subreddit is run by Foundry users for Foundry users.\n* [Foundry Hub](https://www.foundryvtt-hub.com/) - A fansite with easily searchable module database, articles on Foundry and more!\n* A number of smaller subcommunities, mostly on Discord.\n\n---\n\n2) The **main sources of information** for new users are:\n\n* [Foundry official Knowledge Base](https://foundryvtt.com/kb/) - documentation that goes into a lot of detail about all Foundry core features.\n* [Foundry community Wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/home) - still growing in submissions, but by chance - it might have just what you are looking for.\n* Either of these **troubleshooting guides**: [Interactive](https://prezi.com/view/Wpq1WQv92LC1KNwwAEyG/) and [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sdn2s9Bf3iJ_8sTJ6flA60Vl0jIb8XtTayglpflpV00/edit#heading=h.iexey4hb7e77).\n* Subreddit wiki of /r/FoundryVTT that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/wiki/index).\n* Searching /r/FoundryVTT and Discord (when searching on Discord, chose as few of the important keywords as possible for best results).\n\n---\n\n3) **Help others help you!** Especially when you have a technical issue, provide information that is necessary to solve it. \n\n* Please include the game system you are using in the title of the post - [D&D5e] or [PF2e], for example.\n* **Ideally**, if you can log into a Foundry world, press the `Support` button located in the [Game Setting tab](https://i.imgur.com/3Kf0tMt.png), and [copy-paste the section under \u201cSupport Details\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/9Zpemfo.png). \n* *If you can\u2019t get into a world, at least mention: Foundry version, Game System and it\u2019s version, hosting setup (Foundry client, NodeJS, cloud service, etc.), what browser are you using, operating system.*\n* **The most common cause for issues in Foundry are modules.** Always try to reproduce your issue with all modules turned off to find out if that is the case. You can use [Find the Culprit module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/find-the-culprit/) to assist identifying the problem module.\n* Remember to check the browser developer console for red error messages. You can usually access the console by pressing F12; otherwise [read here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch002153.htm).\n\n---\n\nMore useful information can be found in the comments!",
