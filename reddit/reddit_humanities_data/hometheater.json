AudioQuest reps hated me, because I constantly asked for proof of their claims and was always declined. Fun times.",

My wife had a requirement that wires couldn\u2019t be running around or speakers be hanging off the wall, which is why everything is either in the wall or in ceiling. I know it\u2019s not ideal. At least I took the sticker off my AVR.\n\nThe equipment is:\n- Epson LS12000\n- Denon X3800H\n- 6x Klipsch CDT-3800 in ceiling\n- 3x Klipsch DS-250W-LCR in wall\n- 2x Klipsch R101SW\n- 100\u201d Vivid Storm ALR sound transparent screen\n\nI used the Audyssey feature to tune the speakers and subwoofers for the space. I also tilted the in-ceiling speakers to be at the right angle for my main seat. The configuration is 5.2.4 but I might change it to 7.2.2 if I don\u2019t feel the atmos height channels aren\u2019t working well given my speaker placement.",
