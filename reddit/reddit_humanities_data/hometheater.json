            "Opposite of a deal, but I posted a thread last week noting the prices of all the 98'' TVs and all of the TLC ones have gone up. The flagship MQ851 was $5k, now $6k, and all the others had corresponding increases. Pretty crazy as I was leaning towards the MQ851 but was waiting to see if we might be getting a 4/4 deal.",
            "Theres a chance theyre bumping the base price to make deals look bigger.",

The cabinet is a custom designed one to match exactly the layout. TV conduit was already there. TV is a 77\u201c LG OLED, mounted with a slim Vogels wall mount with only 1.5cm thickness.",

            "Clean minimal setup, whats up with the speakers? Thats a strange position for the fronts ",
            "Looks clean, but why put them so high if you dont have to? I have a front setup in the ceiling because I couldnt get them on the wall or on stands due to an odd setup, but Id love to have them next to the tv instead of up high.",
            "Optimal speaker placement has Left and Right speakers at the same height (ear level) as Center.  \n\nYou have your center at the lowest possible point, and your Left and Right at nearly the highest possible point which is dramatically far from an ideal location.  Its about as wrong as you could place them if you purposefully did the exact opposite of what Dolby recommended.",
            "Guys using 3 old mobile phones for speakers \n\nBut seriously man, get at least bookshelves, a real center, some stands and cover up this mess. But if you're fine with those phone sized speakers for ants, at least place them properly.",

            "What a fantastic lived in living room.  Plants, books and decorations all with 7 speakers and a TV that is actually mounted at the right height.  Monitor audio makes excellent speakers and with this cozy space they have to sound nice and big.  \n\nEveryone posting about mounting a tv at neck cranking heights above a fireplace in an empty white living room need to see this post!",
            "Its a bit claustrophobic. Surrounds are too close, making them too localizable.",
            "The thing with darker colors for walls is they will change wildly over time, so you cant really do touch ups, you repaint the whole wall/room every time. Been rocking several variations of medium burgundy on my living room for a decade. Not anymore since we had a kid."

            "Just from looking at the description of the speakers it seems that the seller didn't have a clue what they were doing.  I'd be wary of buying from them.  Klipsch Reference isn't highly regarded.  Klipsch Premiere line is much better. \n\n# \n\n#"
