            "Does there exist any comparisons between all the arcane caster classes?\n\nThis game has about a billion different casters who get very similar features, and it makes it difficult from an outsiders perspective to figure out which class/subclass is best for what you want to do. I might do research and do a post on it later, but I wanted to see if anyone has seen a resource, video, thread, etc. On the topic before I give it a crack.",
            "Has anyone figured out a fix for the input lag? When I click on character portraits or items in shops, there's lag of 1/2 second to 1 second, give or take I'm not sure. I'm not the only one who's been having this issue, and it's been weeks now. Is there any chance of this getting fixed or are we just screwed?",
            "  What classes in WOTR use mainly strength and are purely physical? Is it just Barbarian?",
            "I'm starting another playthrough and plan on using more mercanaries that I normally would, but I'd love to get dialog from characters not in the active party. I seem to remember a mod that would allow you to do that, but my google skills have failed me. Does a mod like that exist? Is it an option in Toy Box I'm not seeing? Thanks!",

From what I've seen it seems to eliminate not only the attack penalty with the shield itself (which is what I remember it doing) but also with the mainhand weapon? \n\nAm I even right in this? And if I am, is Mythic TWF no longer needed for Shield Bash builds then? Or is there still a -2 AB to eliminate in case you're wielding a non light weapon in the main hand and a heavy shield in the offhand?",

But when I took Second Mystey Animal with Daeran and chose the pet at lvl 7, the wolf only leveled up to lvl 6. Do I need to pick up Boon Companion or did I run into a bug?"

How does that work, do I later interupt/pause my Main Story run to send my party on DLC stories? \n\nCan you recommend an \"order\" for playing the base game + DLCs?",
