            "\\[KM\\] Trying to find clarification in how an elemental enchantment affects the +X damage reduction rules.\n\n  \nFor instance: If I have a Flaming Shortsword +2, does this overcome Cold Iron DR in Kingmaker? I know you need either a cold iron weapon or +3 to overcome the cold iron DR. And I've seen some forums say that the \"flaming\" trait counts towards the +10 (?) total you are allowed to have a on a weapon but I'm not clear if it is considered part of the calculation in DR.\n\n  \nDoes that mean my +2 Flaming Sword will overcome cold iron DR? (+2 for the base and +1 for the flaming) or is it still considered a +2 for DR purposes?\n\n  \nI would test in game but I haven't found a weapon with a trait that perfectly lines up with this scenario (yet).",
            "Does there exist any comparisons between all the arcane caster classes?\n\nThis game has about a billion different casters who get very similar features, and it makes it difficult from an outsiders perspective to figure out which class/subclass is best for what you want to do. I might do research and do a post on it later, but I wanted to see if anyone has seen a resource, video, thread, etc. On the topic before I give it a crack.",
            "\\[WOTR\\]  \nAsked about this before, but unsure about some of the specifics. But, for a future run I was considering maybe trying to come up with a thematic character for going for the secret ending.  \n>!From my understanding the KC, Areelu and maybe the companions ascend to godhood in it, so I was considering trying to make a build based around what the Golarion pantheon is missing. And then I remembered hearing about Godsrain, where Gorum has perished, leaving an empty spot I guess? Now I'm not sure I want to just make Gorum 2.0 or basically an avatar of him, but something different, but roughly fills his spot.  \nFor this I was considering maybe making a character that would become the patron of Strategists, Navigators and War. Probably if they were a deity you could choose in game, they might have the domains of Knowledge, War, Travel, and not sure about the other 2, but maybe Magic, Protection, Nobility, Community, whatever. That part isn't too important.!<\n\nAs for the actual build, I'm not entirely sure, but I was considering maybe a Magus wielding the Death's Consonant, either form. Not sure what else I might want after that tbh. I once considered doing a build with the heavy pick form that was something like a Sword Saint 20, Duelist 7 or so, Student of War X and then whatever else. But not sure how good that idea would be and would obviously require going Legend, which isn't viable for the secret ending from what I understand.",

What spell combos are getting you to mythic 1 or 2? Spell focus abjuration makes sense in my head for dispel magic later but I'm not sure if I should hold off on that unitl later.\n\nLiving diety->nature, 19 cha 14 dex human if it matters.

            "\\[WR\\] HELP! I can't finish Wenduag's romance in chapter five because when I take the poison the screen turns black then returns, and I just lay dying on the ground. Nothing happens until I press enter. Then the screen turns black again, when the picture returns all characters are just frozen but also starts shaking uncontrollably. I can reload from this state but nothing else. The dialogue-window in the right says a dialogue has started and I get the \"A Flame\"-achievement but it's no use since I have to reload a earlier save. I have retried this many times, it just bugs the F out.\n\nAny thoughts or tips?\n\nI have pressed aLT + b and reported it but I hear nothing from them."

            "(WR)  Toying around with the concept of a staff + shield battlemage type whose tanky, makes uses of their shield but primarily a spellcaster. Will obviously need to dip Titan Fighter to be able to equip them together early on. Trying not to go Aeon as a mythic since I've played that path a lot already. \n\nConsidering the following: \n\n01. Wizard/Sorcerer + Titan Fighter (1) and Hellknight Signifier for an armored battlemage with a shield and staff. That or take away Signified and just keep Mage Armor. \n\n02. Oracle/Cleric + Titan Fighter (1) for a divine version which would go especially great with the Angel mythic path. \n\n03. Druid + Titan Fighter (1) which could work with the other mythic paths such as Azata, Lich or Demon. \n\nWould any of these work well? Not looking to play on harder difficulties but would still like the build to be serviceable.",

            "Azata + Sorceror is fun.  You can go Crossblooded Sorceror, but its frustrating in the early game having almost no spells, and delayed spell progression. Vanilla Sorceror is fine; Geomancer is good too. Take Fire Elemental Bloodline, and possibly a fire damage Draconic Bloodline (ie Gold or Red) later with the mythic feat.\n\nFire Elemental lets you turn any spell to Fire Damage; Red Dragon Bloodline gets you +1 damage on fire spells.  Get the Ring of Pyromania in Act 3, and Mallander's Insult (belt, don't forget to enable it once its on) from Relic research ASAP.\n\nMythic Feats: Absolutely must get Ascendent Element: Fire.  Abundant Casting is nice to be able to blast more spells between rests; Mythic Spell Pen is good too.  Extra Bloodline is handy.  You can get Enduring spells if you want to cast buffs, but honestly if I'm going to be chucking damage spells all day, I'll bring someone else to do buffs.  Sorcerous Reflex is also REALLY great, since you'll often be opening with a scorching ray, it means a free quickened spell every combat.   Selective Metamagic is nice for Bolster, so you can do something like, Scorching Ray, Bolstered Scorching Ray, Bolstered Empowered Scorching Ray for level 2/3/4 spells.\n\nYou'll be very weak early on, and mostly relegated to Grease/Winters Grasp/Haste, but eventually you'll get Chain Lightning at lvl 12 or 13 (convert it to fire!) and Zippy Magic, and then everything just dies.\n\nTake Spell Pen feats, and Bolster/Empower metamagic feats.  Use metamagic rods for Maximize/Quicken, they're not worth the feat.\n\nSome of the better spells to get are Scorching Ray (comes from Fire bloodline; isn't good until you're further in the game and have fire damage gear), Hellfire Ray, Chain Lightning, Sirocco (*only if using Selective Metamagic).\n\nEnd game your spellbook is probably filled with Metamagic'd Scorching Rays and Chain Lightnings.",

There is a workaround of sorts: splash Skald and its ability to use shields (and medium armor) without ASF will carry over to your wizard / sorcerer spells too.\n\nThere's a [PnP feat too](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/shield-mastery-feats/shielded-mage-combat-shield-mastery/), but I'm not aware of any mods which add it to WotR.",
