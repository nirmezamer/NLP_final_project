            "hope we get to see more of shimo in the future, felt so bad for her the whole time being in pain and forced to hurt people, glad she got her happy ending",
            "That was absolutely bonkers, just as expected. They totally kicked Skar King's ass tho, he didn't seem all that powerful. But the way they did it was beautiful",
            "It was such a good movie,but it felt shortwr than I expected",
            "Suko getting rag dolled, and used as a flail will always be funny.",
            "I really enjoyed this movie. Kong and Suko were the heart of it. Godzilla was pretty cool but i would have liked more scenes of him acting.\nSkar king and shimo should have been introduced at the end of the first act in my opinion.\nThey waited with introducing them until like the middle of the second act. So there wasn't much time to make them feel as if they had an enduring presence.\nThe set pieces are all bundled together at the very end, and it sorta speeds through em. Like the fight starts and then it ends.\n\nThe way i would structure this movie:\nMovie opens with Kong opening the great ape's prison as normal.\nBut instead of him going all the way back up to the surface and hanging out there for a bit, and then going back down. And then hanging out, and then doing some exploring where he meets suko and then he eventually makes it to skar king's lair like 1 hour into the movie.\n\nI'd instead make kong immediately start exploring the area he opens up shortly after the scenes establishing his lonelyness. Then continue with encountering Suko being the inciting incident. I think skipping the whole \"kong goes back up a little bit before going back down\" segment would tighten the movie a lot.",

            "I really hope the last fight could have go longer. The last fight is not as intense than GvsK's final fight as there are less struggles. I really like Scar King as a villain but the final fight has not enough screen time on him.",
            "Skar King is so badass but that punch in Rio with the glove from Kong was so vile and he took it like a champ spitting out his tooth.",
            "HE SUPLEXED KONG OFF OF THE GREAT PYRAMID\n\nPEAK",
            "I think they put Godzilla first on the last 2 films title just because they want to put the name in alphabetical order (& probably to keep Toho's people pleased) \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut jokes aside, the last 2 films is indeed Kong-centred & Godzilla's side of story is totally tanked on those 2 films. Props to them to keep Godzilla's \"force of nature\" aspect around, but he looks like an angry tyrant who will do everything it takes to get what he wants more than ever now. I heard that Wingard said that he struggles to build a proper story around Godzilla, but I don't think it should be the reason. He just need to find a proper story writer & be less biased towards Kong (at least in terms of character development).\n\nOverall, the battles in the film is quite entertaining, if being seen as just as a monster fighting each other. Jia's character development is quite interesting, but not properly paced & it has a broad potential to be explore further. Mothra & Shimo is quite underutilised and other minor titan is, well, just another cameos without proper characterisation.\n\nIn the end, just like GvK, GxK is an entertaining monster brawling film. But if you wanted more, you'll left a bit disappointed."

            "I think both franchises have built their own lore regarding kaiju and it doesn\u2019t really gel together well. Besides, Monsterverse doesn\u2019t need pacific rim jaegers, they just need to introduce Jet Jaguar.",
            "The concept of a jaeger isn't out of question, a human-powered robot the size of a kaiju would be cool. We kinda had that with Mechagodzilla, although the ghidorah skull took over, if we just had a human it might work.\n\nA full on crossover with the pacific rim kaiju is way too much, though. It wouldn't really fit in with kaiju and jaegers coming in through a portal.",
            "I don\u2019t like the idea of it in the mainline universes. I\u2019d be fine with something like JLvGvK.",
            "Because Godzilla can fold the entire verse",
            "I think it\u2019d be a really cool idea. The pacific rim movies are underrated gems. Almost cult films at this point. Would be a really cool crossover.",
            "It seems like this is only an issue with the Godzilla fanbase because anywhere else on Reddit or the internet from people who aren't Kaiju fans, they seem to support the idea of \"Godzilla and Kong fighting with/against Pacific Rim Jaegers\".\n\nI have no clue why people bring up the idea of adding Gamera or Ultraman to the MV but not Pacific Rim which is a far more likely and far superior option than those two. Legendary already owns the PR franchise, and it's far more marketable and popular with the general audience than literally any Japanese kaiju aside from Godzilla himself.\n\nIt could either be a one movie crossover where both worlds become connected by a new Kaiju rift or you could reboot the PR franchise and have Monarch start building Jaegers.",
            "Because the power balance would make it exceedingly short. To the point that the entire Pacific rim world would have to be rebooted or given a massive steroid injection via plot to contend. Gamera and Ultraman are long standing characters that have more fans and deeper roots in the Kaiju community, and they better fit the level Godzilla fights on.\n\nThe only reason pacific rim would be \"better\" is because legendary already owns it. It's better as it's own thing.",
            "I made a post on this on the Pacific rim subreddit and they seemed not to fond of it as much since they see it as  desperation for the franchise which idk why they would think that since I think majority of people think it'll be cool.",
            "Because power scalers honestly. Yes the pacific rim verse is not at strong but who cares when they're fighting against and with Titans. We want giant robots and kaiju should be easy to sell."
