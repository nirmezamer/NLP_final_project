            "hope we get to see more of shimo in the future, felt so bad for her the whole time being in pain and forced to hurt people, glad she got her happy ending",

            "Felt the movie was fun but just way too rush and that ending,wow. Talk about sprinting to the finish line. The people in my theatre legit thought there was still more to the movie and no one moved till its obvious it did ended.\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "I like it but I had some disappointment too. The trailers make me imagining another type of story, with more lore and context\n\nI loved Godzilla vs Kong because every fight/encounter was well built. For me this movie lacks of that. But hey I like big monsters fighting and for me it's enough"

            "I think both franchises have built their own lore regarding kaiju and it doesn\u2019t really gel together well. Besides, Monsterverse doesn\u2019t need pacific rim jaegers, they just need to introduce Jet Jaguar.",
            "The concept of a jaeger isn't out of question, a human-powered robot the size of a kaiju would be cool. We kinda had that with Mechagodzilla, although the ghidorah skull took over, if we just had a human it might work.\n\nA full on crossover with the pacific rim kaiju is way too much, though. It wouldn't really fit in with kaiju and jaegers coming in through a portal.",
            "I don\u2019t like the idea of it in the mainline universes. I\u2019d be fine with something like JLvGvK.",
            "Probably because the universes are so drastically different",
            "I think it\u2019d be a really cool idea. The pacific rim movies are underrated gems. Almost cult films at this point. Would be a really cool crossover.",
            "Because it makes no sense in canon, like why didn't godzilla intervene in closing the Breach if he's the protector of the planet?",
            "Crossovers can be good. It's best if they aren't canon, though.\u00a0",
            "Because the power balance would make it exceedingly short. To the point that the entire Pacific rim world would have to be rebooted or given a massive steroid injection via plot to contend. Gamera and Ultraman are long standing characters that have more fans and deeper roots in the Kaiju community, and they better fit the level Godzilla fights on.\n\nThe only reason pacific rim would be \"better\" is because legendary already owns it. It's better as it's own thing.",
            "Pacific Rim has their characters, the Monsterverse has theirs. If those main characters fought, one or the other would die. If they don't die, cool. And if they just fight different kaiju cool. But at that point, what's even the point of a crossover if they're just going to do what they already do in their own universe?"

        "content": "Hey guys, I'd never read any of the Godzilla movie novelizations myself, but I kept hearing from people who had that there were a bunch of examples where Godzilla seemed way less powerful in the books than he did on the big screen. Here are some of the things people told me:\n\n- In the Godzilla 2014 movie, the military attacks didn't even scratch the Big G, which made sense. But apparently in the novel version, the missiles made him bleed a ton and even put holes in his dorsal plates! That was crazy to me, because in the movies, those plates seemed like the toughest things in the universe. I mean, Kong used one as an axe to do all sorts of insane stuff. He slid from the Hollow Earth to the surface, and from the upper Hollow Earth to the Subterranean Realm, using the axe to control his falling speed by chopping it into a surface and using friction to slide down more slowly. The axe even tanked Godzilla's atomic breath over and over, and we'd seen that breath drill straight from the surface to the Hollow Earth! When the axe overloaded with energy, it caused an explosion strong enough to knock out both Godzilla and Kong. Plus, Kong used the charged axe to destroy Mechagodzilla, who was supposed to be made of the toughest man-made metals. The dorsal plates also survived Godzilla's burning form and the crazy hot nuclear pulses he did that vaporized Ghidorah. These thermonuclear pulses were supposed to be hotter than nuclear explosions, which can reach 100 million degrees Celsius - otherwise, humans could have just used nukes to kill Ghidorah themselves. Ghidorah even dropped Godzilla from the stratosphere once and he landed on his dorsal plates, but they were still fine. They'd had a ridiculous list of feats, but the book had them getting wrecked by some missiles? Didn't add up.\n\n- Another thing I heard was that when Kong had the Beast Glove in the novel, he knocked Godzilla out way longer than in the movie. On film, Godzilla just seemed dazed for a couple seconds, but apparently Kong straight up KO'd him in the book and even had time to drag him around for a bit. \n\n- Then there was the scene where Shimo blasted Godzilla with his Frostbite attack. In the novel, it froze Godzilla so badly that Mothra apparently had to save him or he might have been a popsicle for thousands of years like Ghidorah, or even died. But in the movie, it looked like Godzilla just heated himself back up and busted out pretty quick, and Mothra helping didn't seem all that critical.\n\n- Oh, and get this - the book had Shimo straight up yeet Godzilla halfway across Rio with a simple attack, and the Big G was knocked out cold for like a full minute or more. Poor Kong got jumped by Skar King and Shimo with no backup that whole time.\n\nAnd there were apparently a ton more examples like this in the novels that just made Godzilla seem so much more vulnerable, like he was just a regular monster and not the King of the Monsters we knew.\n\nSo yeah, from what I'd been told, it really did seem like the novelizations nerfed Godzilla big time compared to his movie self. If any of you have actually read the books, I would love to hear your confirmation - did Godzilla really come across as much weaker in these novels than he does in the films?",

            "Monsterverse has started as a cinematic verse therefor I consider the \"true\" canon to be what we see in movies.",
            "Apparently the KOTM novelization makes him out to be much stronger than he's seen in the movie. Most of the time in the film we see him losing to Ghidorah. But the novelization is where he's beating Ghidorah in the Boston fight until he taps into the power grid",
            "The novels very much weaken Godzilla.",
            "Novels are not fully canon if there's something that contradict from the movie in the novel then that's automatically becomes non canon!",
            "The novels are adaptations and not canon so you can ignore em",
            "Kong did not KO Godzilla. I've read that part, and nothing suggests that.",
            "Yeah, this makes imo the most sense. The book could\u2019ve still been influenced by some early drafts.",
            "I mean, with Mothra's help, he burst out faster, but even without Mothra's help, I think Godzilla could still burst out. From what I've seen in the movie, it's not a big deal for him. It's like what happened in the KOMT movie: with Mothra's help, Godzilla was able to overpower Ghidorah more quickly. However, even when she was busy fighting Rodan, Godzilla still managed to overpower Ghidorah. Ghidorah had to get an amp to turn the tables.",
            "I haven\u2019t read any for he book versions, but film adaptation are often based on earlier drafts/screenplays to my knowledge",
            "my media theory is that, they cant show godzilla on the losing side in the movies, iirc there are rules Toho gave to legendary on how to handle godzilla and one of those rules is that G man cant lose, so having him on the loosing side of a non Real Goji rival is not allowed. \n\nmy 2nd take is that The novels are always much more in depth since words can explain stuff much more in depth than movies, and movies are always in the good or bad when it comes to novel sources type of movies, they're never perfect for the novel readers\n\n3rd take is that the run time would be too long, so they just fixed it to be enjoyable for general audience and reading the novel is a extra treat for the fans"
