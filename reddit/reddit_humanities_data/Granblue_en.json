The latter will reward you with a substential amount of Tokens upon defeat. Additionally, \"Extreme\" raids have a higher chance of spawning Nightmare solo-battles, which will grant the player 100 Tokens for each successful clear and replenish a few host materials.\n\n>These multi-battles are suggested due to their relatively low amount of hit points, making it possible to cycle through them quickly. Commonly agreed-upon milestones are 4 Boxes (for Golden Gifts), 10 Boxes (for Damascus Crystals), and 20 Boxes (for Crystals). However, you can choose to clear many more boxes to generate Half-Elixirs and Soul Berries, depending on your specific needs.\n\n>Typically, acquiring around 750 materials from \"Very Hard\" raids, along with the additional ones from Honor and Battle Badges, should provide you with enough host materials to acquire the Tokens needed to clear 20 Boxes from Extreme raids and Nightmare battles.\n\n>As mentionned above, one can make the choice to stop at 4 Boxes and only acquire around 100 host materials. If the goal chosen is only 10 Boxes, then around 300 host materials should be obtained.\n\n>The first 5 multi-battles of the day cost no AP or host materials. It is recommended to spend them on either \"Impossible\" or \"Extreme\" raids to acquire more tokens.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPast event threads: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/search/?q=flair%3A%22Event%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new).",
