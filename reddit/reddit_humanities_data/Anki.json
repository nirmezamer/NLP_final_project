        "content": "I decided to make one post where I compile all of the useful links that I can think of.\n\n# 1) If you have never heard about FSRS before, start here: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS)\n\n2) AnKing's video about FSRS: [https://youtu.be/OqRLqVRyIzc](https://youtu.be/OqRLqVRyIzc)\n\n3) A guide to using FSRS, please read it **before** making a post/comment with a question: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md)\n\nAnki's manual has been updated to use info from this guide. However, as time passes, Anki's manual becomes more and more outdated compared to this guide.\n\nThe links above are the most important ones. The links below are more like supplementary material: you don't have to read all of them to use FSRS in practice.\n\n4) Features of the FSRS Helper add-on: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1attbo1/explaining\\_fsrs\\_helper\\_addon\\_features/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1attbo1/explaining_fsrs_helper_addon_features/)\n\n5) Understanding what retention actually means: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1anfmcw/you\\_dont\\_understand\\_retention\\_in\\_fsrs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1anfmcw/you_dont_understand_retention_in_fsrs/)\n\nI recommend reading that post if you are confused by terms like \"desired retention\", \"true retention\" and \"average predicted retention\", the latter two can be found in Stats if you have the Helper add-on installed and press Shift + Left Mouse Click on the Stats button.\n\n5.5) How \"Compute optimal retention\" works in Anki 24.04 and newer: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention)\n\nIn Anki 24.04.1 it was renamed to \"Minimum recommended retention\".\n\n6) Benchmarking FSRS to see how it performs compared to other algorithms: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1c29775/fsrs\\_is\\_one\\_of\\_the\\_most\\_accurate\\_spaced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1c29775/fsrs_is_one_of_the_most_accurate_spaced/). It's my most high effort post.\n\n7) An article about spaced repetition algorithms in general, from the creator of FSRS: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert)\n\n8) A technical explanation of the math behind the algorithm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18tnp22/a\\_technical\\_explanation\\_of\\_the\\_fsrs\\_algorithm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18tnp22/a_technical_explanation_of_the_fsrs_algorithm/)\n\n9) FSRS is more accurate if you only use Again and Good: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1d0fmsz/fsrs_is_more_accurate_if_you_only_use_again_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1d0fmsz/fsrs_is_more_accurate_if_you_only_use_again_and/)\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Support Jarrett Ye (u/LMSherlock), the creator of FSRS: [Github sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/L-M-Sherlock), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jarrettye). \ud83d\udcb2\n\nThis post is pinned.\n\nEDIT: since around 50% of questions I get are related to interval lengths and desired retention, I want to say:\n\n# If your intervals feel too long, increase desired retention. If your intervals feel too short, decrease desired retention.",

            "My easiest deck makes some large jumps in intervals after switching to FSRS. For example, a card with a previous interval of 7.5 months might jump to 8.5 years if I press 'good', roughly 13-14 times as long as my last interval. I'm extremely suspicious that I would still be able to recall the information in 8.5 years. I suppose FSRS hasn't been out for 8.5 years to actually test this practically, but doesn't this intuitively seem like too big of a jump in interval length?",

            "Don't have any questions (yet). Just wanted to thank you for creating this. I want to use spaced repetition for math based on a method created by Barbara Oakley (by internalizing key example problems). It seemed perfect for Anki but the cards just appeared way too often. Not only does this show them less often (while still achieving the comprehension I need) but it adapts based on my desired retention.\n\nI set my desired retention to 83% and it works perfectly!",
            "I use FSRS only for a single deck (a vocab deck) and I've been working on this particular deck for 13 months now (300k+ reviews). For the first 4 months, I used a different review method that made me fail more cards than usual. Today, I ran `fsrs4anki_optimizer.ipynb` (FSRS4Anki v4.11.0 Optimizer) on my deck again, once with all reviews (A) and once with `revlog_start_date` set to the day I changed my review habits on (B). The results were confusing so I went ahead, deleted (in a separate profile) all cards that were *created* (\"first reviewed\" would be more accurate but I didn't know how to accomplish that in Anki's browser) before that day (C). The results:\n\n  | A: All reviews | B: Last 9 months (`revlog_start_date`) | C: Last 9 months (deleting cards)\n---|---|---|----\nParameters | [0.1284, 0.189, 0.3378, 1.0375, 6.214, 0.757, 0.6806, 0.0527, 0.5663, 0.1, 0.3838, 1.4255, 0.1802, 0.772, 0.655, 0.1467, 4.0] | [0.1771, 0.2267, 0.3281, 1.2701, 6.473, 1.0668, 0.9916, 0.0127, 0.7462, 0.1063, 0.424, 1.6412, 0.1854, 0.7495, 0.2953, 0.1549, 4.0] | [0.4669, 0.7543, 1.5493, 58.3511, 5.5481, 1.4582, 1.427, 0.0199, 1.3801, 0.1, 0.8318, 2.1823, 0.0351, 0.3906, 1.6535, 0.3765, 4.0]\nLoss before training | 0.6456 | 0.6493 | 0.4200\nLoss after training | 0.5316 | 0.5317 | 0.4055\nR-squared | 0.9541 | 0.9091 | 0.5960\nRMSE | 0.0236 | 0.0278 | 0.0488\nMAE | 0.0136 | 0.0139 | 0.0196\n? | [-0.05011412  1.06537337] | [-0.0842633   1.11011016] | [0.24063045 0.71997153]\nUniversal Metric of FSRS | 0.0097 | 0.0100 | 0.0342\nToday's reviews | slightly fewer than before (~200) | ~30% of the entire deck | almost 0; forecast maxing out at ~70/d in about 10 days\n\nI find these results very hard to interpret and I wanted to ask you for your interpretation, as well as the best way to continue forward. Judging by the fact that my \"True retention\" is already consistently a bit higher than my target retention (0.80) as it is, I cannot believe that doing more reviews (B) is beneficial. At the same time, absolutely decimating my review count (C) also doesn't strike me as beneficial (it is still more believable than (B) though).\n\nI suspected that `revlog_start_date` may have been implemented poorly (e.g. by simply \"cutting off\" a card's older reviews and feeding it into the optimizer as though it was brand new, when in reality it may already have been repped many times at that point and may have a better-than-new stability). Also, simply just the fact that (B) is a lot closer to (A) than (C) puzzles me.\n\nIf the optimizer had an option to give more weight/credence to more recent reviews, that could potentially be a better solution for people who change their review habits than using `revlog_start_date`.",
            "I have been using Fsrs for a king for about a month now. Prior to this my true retention was at 91%, I set my desired retention to 89% but now my true retention is at 81% for the last month. Any tips? Will it even out over time and adjust?",
            "Unbelievable, this has been so useful, thank uuuu",
            "Is the calculation of optimal retention based on current/optimized weights? I couldn't find this information, which leads me to believe it might not be. Another thing if you don't mind...are the metrics 'Log loss: 0.4232' and 'RMSE(bins): 10.02%' bad? I have 539 reviews as of now.",
            "My log loss (0.9178) and RMSE (51.65%) are extremely high....why and how to fix. I have parameters [0.5614, 1.2546, 3.5878, 7.9731, 5.1043, 1.1303, 0.8230, 0.0465, 1.6290, 0.1350, 1.0045, 2.1320, 0.0839, 0.3204, 1.3547, 0.2190, 2.7849] and desired retention 70%",
            "u/Glutanimate what's up with so many removed comments? There are 6 removed comments in this thread, and as far as I remember, only one of them was even remotely bad. Either some mod has gone rogue and is deleting everything he doesn't like, or you recently implemented some automated system that is too aggressive. At least that's what I'm guessing. \n\nIt says \"Comment removed by moderator\" in the new Reddit desing and \"Removed\" in old Reddit for those comments.",
            "Dumb question: if I tweak parameters manually and Log loss and RMSE(bins) then happen to be lower does that still count as optimization?"
