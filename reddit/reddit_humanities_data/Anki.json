        "content": "I decided to make one post where I compile all of the useful links that I can think of.\n\n# 1) If you have never heard about FSRS before, start here: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS)\n\n2) AnKing's video about FSRS: [https://youtu.be/OqRLqVRyIzc](https://youtu.be/OqRLqVRyIzc)\n\n3) A guide to using FSRS, please read it **before** making a post/comment with a question: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md)\n\nAnki's manual has been updated to use info from this guide. However, as time passes, Anki's manual becomes more and more outdated compared to this guide.\n\nThe links above are the most important ones. The links below are more like supplementary material: you don't have to read all of them to use FSRS in practice.\n\n4) Features of the FSRS Helper add-on: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1attbo1/explaining\\_fsrs\\_helper\\_addon\\_features/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1attbo1/explaining_fsrs_helper_addon_features/)\n\n5) Understanding what retention actually means: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1anfmcw/you\\_dont\\_understand\\_retention\\_in\\_fsrs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1anfmcw/you_dont_understand_retention_in_fsrs/)\n\nI recommend reading that post if you are confused by terms like \"desired retention\", \"true retention\" and \"average predicted retention\", the latter two can be found in Stats if you have the Helper add-on installed and press Shift + Left Mouse Click on the Stats button.\n\n5.5) How \"Compute optimal retention\" works in Anki 24.04 and newer: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention)\n\nIn Anki 24.04.1 it was renamed to \"Minimum recommended retention\".\n\n6) Benchmarking FSRS to see how it performs compared to other algorithms: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1c29775/fsrs\\_is\\_one\\_of\\_the\\_most\\_accurate\\_spaced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1c29775/fsrs_is_one_of_the_most_accurate_spaced/). It's my most high effort post.\n\n7) An article about spaced repetition algorithms in general, from the creator of FSRS: [https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert)\n\n8) A technical explanation of the math behind the algorithm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18tnp22/a\\_technical\\_explanation\\_of\\_the\\_fsrs\\_algorithm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18tnp22/a_technical_explanation_of_the_fsrs_algorithm/)\n\n9) FSRS is more accurate if you only use Again and Good: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1d0fmsz/fsrs_is_more_accurate_if_you_only_use_again_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1d0fmsz/fsrs_is_more_accurate_if_you_only_use_again_and/)\n\n\ud83d\udcb2 Support Jarrett Ye (u/LMSherlock), the creator of FSRS: [Github sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/L-M-Sherlock), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jarrettye). \ud83d\udcb2\n\nThis post is pinned.\n\nEDIT: since around 50% of questions I get are related to interval lengths and desired retention, I want to say:\n\n# If your intervals feel too long, increase desired retention. If your intervals feel too short, decrease desired retention.",

            "My easiest deck makes some large jumps in intervals after switching to FSRS. For example, a card with a previous interval of 7.5 months might jump to 8.5 years if I press 'good', roughly 13-14 times as long as my last interval. I'm extremely suspicious that I would still be able to recall the information in 8.5 years. I suppose FSRS hasn't been out for 8.5 years to actually test this practically, but doesn't this intuitively seem like too big of a jump in interval length?",
            "Thanks again for this post! Since we can only keep two threads pinned at a time and the WAYSTM thread took over a few days ago, I've now added this thread to the *Resources* tab at the top of the sub :)",
            "Don't have any questions (yet). Just wanted to thank you for creating this. I want to use spaced repetition for math based on a method created by Barbara Oakley (by internalizing key example problems). It seemed perfect for Anki but the cards just appeared way too often. Not only does this show them less often (while still achieving the comprehension I need) but it adapts based on my desired retention.\n\nI set my desired retention to 83% and it works perfectly!",
            "I have been using Fsrs for a king for about a month now. Prior to this my true retention was at 91%, I set my desired retention to 89% but now my true retention is at 81% for the last month. Any tips? Will it even out over time and adjust?",
            "Unbelievable, this has been so useful, thank uuuu",
            "Is the calculation of optimal retention based on current/optimized weights? I couldn't find this information, which leads me to believe it might not be. Another thing if you don't mind...are the metrics 'Log loss: 0.4232' and 'RMSE(bins): 10.02%' bad? I have 539 reviews as of now.",
            "My log loss (0.9178) and RMSE (51.65%) are extremely high....why and how to fix. I have parameters [0.5614, 1.2546, 3.5878, 7.9731, 5.1043, 1.1303, 0.8230, 0.0465, 1.6290, 0.1350, 1.0045, 2.1320, 0.0839, 0.3204, 1.3547, 0.2190, 2.7849] and desired retention 70%",
            "Dumb question: if I tweak parameters manually and Log loss and RMSE(bins) then happen to be lower does that still count as optimization?",
            "I seem to be stuck in a bit of \"ease hell\" myself with my cards recently, with the majority of my cards being in the 95%+ difficulty category. It seems that this might be an artefact of the switch from SM to FSRS, but due to them being at such a high difficulty rating it takes a lot of revirews for the cards to start decreasing in difficulty again. I never really used the easy button before or after FSRS, and I know that changing the grading system is bad, but it seems to be the only way I can get a lot of these cards that I recall perfectly within a second or two out of this \"two day review trap\". Is there any way to fix this otherwise, beyond just waiting weeks for the reviews to normalise?",
            "I'm looking at the Fsrs4anki simulator and I noticed that the memorised count per day shows a trend where 75-85% has the memorised count rise faster than if I did 90-95%, and it is only beaten by them after I run out of cards. Does it make sense instead for me to do a lower retention rate before I learn all the cards and then once I finish my cards I push for a higher retention rate? \n\nLooking at the stats, it seems that before you run out of cards, doing a 75% retention rate gives you the most number of memorised cards with the lowest review count. Doesn't that make a lot of sense for me to do? Once I finish the entire deck I can push for 90% retention rate and still have my review count per day be around 50 cards."

If I am reading this correctly, the cards you know really well you learned quickly, that's why the blue and purple ones that float all the way up are on the smaller side. The big orange and yellow cards must be cards you have a lot of trouble with. I was hoping to see some of those get bigger and bigger but eventually turn blue and float away because of the effectiveness of Anki. Am I reading that right?",

I have already tried to learn them separately, but they are still difficult for me. And are a source of great frustration. I'm thinking about moving them into another deck so they don't get in the way.\n\nI would like to see Anki pumping them with helium, but so far it turns out to be lead. I would dream of a visualization where the left side flies up and is not visible anymore. But unfortunately my laziness overcomes my dream :)",
