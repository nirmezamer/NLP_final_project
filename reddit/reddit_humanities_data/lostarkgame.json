        "content": "Earlier today, I had a surreal experience. I told myself, \"You know what, maybe gaming isn't for me anymore.\"\n\nAs a semi-hardcore enthusiast, I try my best to enjoy Lost Ark  wherever I can. While I don't have the luxury of having a group of gaming friends, and I can't say I have the time to truly master every raid, I still love the game. I haven't conquered Theamine G3 yet, but I've slapped Snake Mommy two weeks in a row (small victories!).\n\nBut I do have to say, we need to do better as a community when it comes to raiding and helping each other out. To keep it short, I was running Tower HM and messed up on the door destruction mechanic in Gate 4. As a result, a vote to quite, followed by the message: \"You have been banned from the party.\" Now, I apologized in chat and explained I was out of position. This experience honestly made me feel terrible, and I almost quit.\n\nWhile I take full responsibility for my mistake, I also recognize my lack of experience in that specific dungeon. However, gaining experience becomes difficult when you get kicked for mistakes. It feels like a catch-22 situation.\n\nThankfully, I have other raids to run, so it's not the end of the world. Still, it was a discouraging experience. I know it's not always possible, and we all have busy lives and limited time, but if we could all just be a little more chill and understanding when people make mistakes, I think it would go a long way in improving the overall health of the game.\n\nAnd no shade to the people I raided with, im sure they have places to be and things to do, its all good.\n\nPS : For people in a similar position : keep it up, we'll get there and get over our raid anxiety eventually.  \nPSS: I have been looking for a gaming group/ guild, but they keep dying.\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Just needed to get it off my chest.\n\nHappy raiding o/",

            "Kicking someone on g4 is insane.  Like that group definitely failed to find a replacement for you and just didn't clear g4 that week.  So dumb.\n\nI've run into very little of this behavior but I know it's out there.  Having a group of friends to do the more difficult raids with goes a long way.",
            "Being kicked for fucking up once is very very rare because people don't want to jail themselves.",

            "I agree with this post thank you for your sharing",
            "Definitely had some similar experiences. Some raids it feels like theres one person like witch hunting trying to find an imposter. People just have bad days or just your timing is off for whatever reason. Youre not going to play perfect everytime.",
            "I had this same revelation pugging g5 hm brel first week release. After dozens of hours of failed pugs, I thought \"do I really want to actually do this?\" and I realize I didn't, took a break until Akkan, and started playing again. I only do a couple raids a week now at most and it's honestly the most fun I've had with this game.",
            "While I dont really agree with the team wanting to quit after 1 mistake/wipe (if that was the first one), on the flip side you'll never fail that mech again!",
            "i mean you have raid anxiety because you know you don't belong in hw parties, why don't you continue playing in learning/semiexp lobbies?",
            "Theres always those stupid toxic assoles, theres nothing you can do about it. honestly, you make a mistake, you know that mistake was your fault, suck to be kick, but wasnt your party and people have right to leave or kick you out.",
            "I wonder if we still are playing a video game. I have not touched lost ark for a month and honestly i feel no urge to come back. Too hard raids ruined it for me. Toxicity raised to a new level."
