If it wasnt for a static thaemine wouldve probably been my last raid. Echidna g1 was pretty quick and enjoyable but g2 just feels like its to punishing.1 player being mind control and then ending wiping 2-3 players in 1 skill if he doesnt go to sleep. limited vision with random butterflies. Just feels like they have a crazy expectation of everybody playing perfectly when they design newer raids. I understand hard mode being hard but normal mode should be more friendly for casual players. Especially since we are having solo raids then newer player are gonna hop onto thaemine/echidna right away wich are pretty hard to learn",

            "this is the problem with the game, tbh.\n\nthere shouldn't be 1 fuck up your entire team is fucked mechs in normal mode because it just breeds toxicity and gatekeeping which in turn turn away the casuals.\n\nthey should be in hard mode not in normal mode.",
            "I think the problem just comes down to how they handle normal & hard mode. It's expected that you move up into hard mode when in reality, they should be the same ilvl but hard mode rewards more mats etc but normal mode is significantly easier, no bs insta wipe mechanics and so on. \n\nThey would probably never transition the raids to work that way on the same entry ilvl though because it would mean lowering the upgrade ceiling and thus lowering their profits from people who spent money in order to buy mats and stuff. \n\nSo I don't ever expect it to change on that front.",

Just uttering the words \u00abWei cheese\u00bb brings a smile to my face.\n\nMeanwhile now, we have vertical systems out the wazoo, too much RNG, goldsinks, and a job resumee is needed to join raids. Oh, and if you don\u2019t RMT, you\u2019re just nerfing yourself, as there doesn\u2019t seem to be any noteworthy punishments except for a slap on the wrist.",
            "Normal mode should be - you fucked up = you dead, your team goes on. \n\nHard mode should be - you fucked up = restart, ggs.\n\n\nThe idea of putting random wipe mechanics that require 4-8 strangers to coordinate or restart is why you can't just matchmake all the raids, and imo the death of matchmaking is what fucks up the casual playerbase the most.",

A raid that youll grind so hard until you hate it and then wait for the next raid and power system. They really do want to kill their playerbase its so unfortunate. Really expected tier4 to refresh and get rid of these new systems that everyone hates but sadly not.",
            "As a good raider from another MMO that came to Lost Ark for easier more chill grindy raids, they seem to be making these too punishing for the average or worse player & also pushing them on us way too soon. \n\nParty Finder experience: Get a bad player (which probability is you will most likely get at least one usually), waste an hour or more, leave to replace, multiple people leave, wait an hour for another party, same thing happens. Then I find myself getting toxic which I don\u2019t want. It\u2019s not healthy & just a huge waste of time. I don\u2019t have 20 hours per week for just 4 Thaemine Normal jails & 2 Echidna Normal jails. This is why I\u2019m trying to majorly scale back my playing time & not even attempting to push Hard Mode anymore. It\u2019s all pushing me away from the game that I enjoyed for so long because you need a decent static or it\u2019s just too inconsistent on a daily basis. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nMaybe we need to get back to Kayangel and Akkan level of Normal difficulty with total prog time = 5-10 hours or less. Then people can get on with their lives (I mean dailies), and don\u2019t need to push Hard Mode if they are casual and/or bad.",

In my opinion Akkan is still a huge problem because it's also overtuned and new players wipe on it a lot. But they are reacting with solo mode, so we will see how that will turn out."
