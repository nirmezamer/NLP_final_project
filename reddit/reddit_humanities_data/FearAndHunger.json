What is Fear and Hunger?\n\n\n***Fear & Hunger,*** (in the community often called 'Funger') is a horror dungeon crawler indie RPG game series that currently contains two games 'Fear and Hunger' and 'Fear and Hunger 2: Termina'. The first game was released on 11 December 2018 and is currently in version 1.4.1. You can watch the release trailer for 'Fear and Hunger' here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lLtw3ejnGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lLtw3ejnGs)\n\nTermina was released on 9 December 2022, is currently in version 1.9.1 and is, unlike the first game, still getting irregular updates. You can watch the release trailer for 'Fear and Hunger 2: Termina' here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OleEkB-7by0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OleEkB-7by0)\n\nThe series is developed and maintained by indie developer Miro Haverinen.\n\nAt the start of 2023 and before the middle of the same year, the games received massive popularity spikes due to popular video content creators.\n\nThe games are in its core very cruel, setting and gameplay wise. They feature mature themes such as disturbing violence and sexual content. Players should be aware, that genitals will be shown in the games. There are a lot of references in both games to other media such as the silent hill series, berserk and many horror movies. To list all references would be damning, so I would like for you to find and spot them in the games yourself.\n\nSetting wise the first game takes place in medieval times, depicting an alternate reality where mighty gods, magic and inhumane monsters exist. The second game, Termina, continues the timeline of the first, and although there are multiple endings, the continuity is obvious for the avid dungeon survivor. Termina takes us to a post-world war era, but with technology more advanced in some places then others. Gods and magic still exist and you have to deal with the consequences of living in a world, with beings much mightier then yourself. The second game build and improves on all aspects of the first and is generally considered more polished and beginner friendly.\n\n# 2. How do I buy/play the games?\n\n[White mold apartments from Termina \\(Fanart\\)](https://preview.redd.it/135fd7ibhchb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d11ae7352da3686aecb3ffa8ca73a24371674ac)\n\nBoth games are available on steam and itch.io, however on some countries the games are region-blocked on steam, so you have to get them from itch.io\n\n## 1. For content creators\n\nIf you want to upload or stream the games, be aware, that some popular platforms such as youtube, twitch, etc. don't allow to directly show genitals on their platforms. Therefore it is recommend to use one of the censor mods available to censor out platform-inappropriate content from the games. The most popular ones will be linked here and can be easily installed by downloading and replacing the correct files in your game folder.\n\n**'Fear and Hunger' censor mods:**\n\n[https://frapollo94.itch.io/fear-hunger-bug-fix-mod](https://frapollo94.itch.io/fear-hunger-bug-fix-mod) by Frapollo94\n\n\\- This mod does not only censor all platform-inappropriate characters, but also fixes some of the most annoying and game-breaking bugs you can encounter in the game. To learn how to use the mod, watch this video by the creator: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kqjD9YHIRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kqjD9YHIRM) or read the instructions on the itch.io page of the mod.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KNn64kngho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KNn64kngho) by NoCommentar\n\n\\- This mod is famous for replacing all genitals with 'pinecone pigs', the video contains download and install instructions in the description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmk7q0zPiXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmk7q0zPiXY) by ADarkRaccoon\n\n\\- This mod also censores the audio and replaces genitals with black shadows, the video contains download and install instructions in the description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**'Fear and Hunger 2: Termina' censor mods:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LPJcCMeqM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LPJcCMeqM8) by NoCommentar\n\n\\- This mod is famous for replacing all genitals with 'pinecone pigs', the video contains download and install instructions in the description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-0QqtUb6t8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-0QqtUb6t8) by ADarkRaccoon\n\n\\- This mod replaces genitals with black shadows, the video contains download and install instructions in the description.\n\n# 3. Which game should I start with?\n\n[Marina \\(the occultist\\) from Termina \\(Fanart\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mlovzuhcichb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=dadcdaf459a4bc3245f4ca6cf87f9fa71ef93e7b)\n\nIf you plan on playing both games you should definitly start with the first one. Not only do you get a continues overarching storyline, you also get to experience how the creator improved his game-making skills from one game to another. Playing Termina first and then the original can be difficult, because you loose a lot of quality of live features Termina provided.\n\nIf you want to tip your toes into the franchise or just want to experience some of Funger, Termina is your way to go. This game is much more beginner friendly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Official channels by the creator\n\n[Miro interacting with the community on X \\(formerly Twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/h11im8syechb1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaef903b4bb79893a0ea0d5defded395a231df8f)\n\nX: [https://twitter.com/happy\\_paintings](https://twitter.com/happy_paintings)\n\nYoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/@fearhunger3983](https://www.youtube.com/@fearhunger3983)\n\nTumblr: [https://fearandhunger.tumblr.com/](https://fearandhunger.tumblr.com/)\n\n# 5. Other frequently asked questions\n\n[A coinflip is an always present gameplay mechanic of the series](https://preview.redd.it/77phvkjjjchb1.png?width=128&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c90cc665e4d9a0ae12e5ce387d2db6b61dfa6e)\n\n **Q: Can you give me some survival tips? My character keeps dying and I don't know how to progress.**\n\nAvoiding enemies and trying new things out will go a long way. Make sure to keep a healthy hunger meter before entering fights, as hunger will affect your performance during combat. Be prepared to die anytime and ignore the toilets. If you have specific questions you can always ask them here on the reddit.\n\n **Q: Is there a \\[insert language\\] translation mod.**\n\nProbably not. This can be outdated, but there currently aren't many language packs available. If you stumble across the internet you might find a russian and spanish translation, but they are incomplete. There is also an english translation mod (because there are a lot of grammatical errors in the game).\n\n **Q: Where Discord link?**\n\n[discord.gg/fearandhunger](https://discord.gg/fearandhunger)\n\n **Q: Can X character survive the dungeon?**\n\nNo. Crow Mauler pecks their head of.\n\n **Q: How to masturbate without killing the girl?**\n\n Ok, thats enough questions.\n\n# 6.

            "This is one of those things that is kinda frustrating to me, when you try analyzing the characters dialogue to get a better understanding of them, because of the potential text that was left in current game by mistake. Apparently the whole event where August kills Tanaka in front of the tower wasn\u2019t completely intentional, and that Miro wasn\u2019t sure if he left it in the code, since it\u2019s \u201csomewhat out of character\u201d for August (which I don\u2019t necessarily think it is)\n\nI don\u2019t remember where I heard it from so it might not be true, (so correct me if I\u2019m wrong) but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me, considering there\u2019s definitely other examples of this. \n\nHere\u2019s a simple example: In Daan's opening Karin says: \u201cI don't need some **queer** eyepatched foreigner telling me what's plausible and what's not.\u201d But in every other character\u2019s opening she says: \u201cI don't need some **flaky** eyepatched foreigner telling me what's possible and what's not.\u201d\n This is likely due to the fact that queer was used to refer to someone as strange or weird in past, which later developed into a mostly homophobic term. (Similar to how Pocketcat is described as \u201ca gay gentleman \u201d in the tales of the Pocketcat books in the first game, and gay used to mean happy in the past) So likely to remove the potential homophobic interpretation from Karin's words, queer was changed to flaky, however he forgot to change it in Daan\u2019s opening for some reason. Which is frustrating to me (a complete overthinker) to what dialogue is intentionally written, and what is leftovers from the earlier drafts of the characters before they were fully realized. It\u2019s annoying that this has to taken into consideration some of the time.",

            "Daan is my favorite as well. His personality, humor, medical diagnosis skill as a party member, and his interactions with the other characters are among the best in the cast. However that\u2019s only half of what makes him my favorite, otherwise it would probably be Marina out of the contestants characters.\n\nHis moonscorch/possession by Pocketcat is by far the best written one in a really tragic way. I won\u2019t get all that into why Daan becomes Pocketcat (that would be really lengthy) so here\u2019s a brief explanation. 1. His parents were Sylvian cultists, which wear bunny masks and are openly perverse. Pocketcat has a cat mask fused to his head and is obviously openly perverse. 2. Daan fears becoming an abuser himself, considering its implied that his parents made him partake in the Sylvian rituals even as a child. Pocketcat is coded as a predator in the first game. 3. Daan has lost everything he had and feels more empty than ever. Pocketcat manipulates him into thinking he can\u2019t make a future for himself as Daan anymore, but he has potential a future as Pocketcat. 4. Pocketcat is a servant of Rher, similar to how Daan fears being tied to his past as a Sylvian cultist against his will.\n\nIt\u2019s largely due to the fact he was neglected for most of his life, and the one time he found happiness in Elise, it was taken away from him by factors he couldn\u2019t control. Basically the message is \u201cdon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d because if you lose it, you lose everything that makes you feel like you have meaning. The fact that Daan is the only character that moonscorches even after winning the festival shows this. Everyone else either gets past their insecurities or learns to distract themselves from them in their B ending.\n\nThe tragedy of it all is the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s mostly in his own head. Pocketcat says: *\u201cYou never felt quite right when you were among those smiling crowds, did you? You always felt like an outsider. Like you were just a bystander, spectating on what life looks like in the sun.\u201d* I think this is true, Daan feels this. Pocketcat knows it since he canonically has the mind read ability. However the rest is just an enabling of Daan's fears that aren\u2019t actually real. *\u201c(\u2026) but that fooled no one. Everyone saw right through it. They knew your true alignment and your past. And you liked it like that. You liked feeling different.\u201d* This is not true at all. Daan likes being the bartender, and enjoys talking to most of the contestants. There\u2019s even a party talk in front of the mayor\u2019s manor showing this: Daan: \u201cI\u2019d imagine this place being the first place people stormed once the town fell into chaos.\u201d Karin: \u201cIt\u2019s never good to stick out. A nail sticking out gets hammered down.\u201d Daan: \u201cThat a jab towards me?\u201d Karin: \u201cI never said anything to that nature. Why? Did it hit a soft spot?\u201d Daan: \u201cNope. I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking.\u201d\n\nThe reason this makes him my favorite character is because I relate to a lot of these things, (in a way less extreme fashion obviously, don\u2019t worry I\u2019ve gotten way better since I played both these games) so Daan's story is like a cautionary tale to me, and inspires me to try not to give into despair.",
            "his backstory makes me feel for him, he cares for others, and i like his snarky personality and dialogue a lot. i also think he's hot lol. an educated, well-dressed guy with trauma and a sense of humor? sign me tf up.",

It is the terror of \"the self\" and that makes it a thriller.\n\nNo, it's not my favorite, but the joke tells itself.",
