I lost count how many managers and front line employees went through the place. Maybe a couple hundred.",

            "Holy shit, how many people were on the floor to begin with? And did those three people quit at the same time? BOGO has been hell. Corporate will NOT let us schedule more people because all they care about is money. Maybe if enough people quit and they lose business because of it, they'll finally learn. Not holding out much hope, though.",
            "Had a customer tell me I was rude because I kept asking her \"anything else?\" When she was ordering, she was like why do you keep saying anything else and not let me finish? She's like your rude. All I said was oh. Cause she was pausing each time so I had to pursue her order along like usual with customers",

People are being impatient and rude, and there's been yelling from both parties. I'm tired of people thinking that behaving this way is acceptable. This isn't okay, we don't deserve this, and corporate should know better. This is why so many people are quitting, and why the remaining are trying to unionize\n\nIf you're one of the kind ones, we can't appreciate you enough, and we'd probably do anything for you lmao. You don't have to tip, just be human and its enough",
            "It would be different if they werent like every damn week it gets ridiculous. it causes rushes at times we normally are slower and have time to do other things, and we dont have as much staff. If they really wanna bring in customers they should lower the mf prices instead. Today has been soo tiring, im on my last 10 and cant wait to leave.",

            "It's simple: work at the pace of one barista because that's what you are. If customers complain, let them call corporate. Corporate won't listen to us, so they might as well hear it from the people dishing out money to wait 40 minutes for their drinks. TAKE YOUR BREAKS. We don't get paid more if we work faster. We don't earn commission on sales. Laxy, my man, you're running this company and thr culture it was founded on into the ground, and you suck.",

The shareholders don't want balanced workloads for employees, they want maximum profits.\n\nWe are all special unique irreplaceable individual.....cogs in a machine that could be replaced in a day.",
            "kind of hard when youre a closer and corporate is screaming at you to get out at 9:30 on the dot because if youre any later you cut into everyone elses hours. we may not get paid more but we want to go home on time and we are pressured to do so constantly. its not right and something needs to change.",
            "You're right. Something needs to change, and closing is really hard. You can either meet customer demands or have cleanliness, but in my experience, you can't have both. I'm strictly an opener now, but when I was closing, my 8 hour shift would often turn into a 10 hour one just because we needed a couple hours to fix the place after working 2 partner plays for most of the afternoon/night. That was before the rapid fire of bogos too. This is absolute lunacy.",
            "Shit with my SSV M-F I dont get out till 9:45-10:12 however my weekend one I get out before 9:30 the latest with her was 9:38 and that was the last 4 for 20 it was a shit show",
            "there is no way that having 2-3 partners for 2-3 hours before close is sustainable and its genuinely breaking people down, myself included. ive been a closer for 2 years and its just been getting worse. no replacements for partners who have quit or changed schedules, no pre closers that care or have time to pre close. when i began we had 4-5 people until closing time and then 3 after close and we got out on time almost every day. the only way i can get out on time now is to leave someone on the floor to do EVERYTHING while someone does dishes and the shift does shift work. its not right. i wish i could leave the store as a massive mess to show how unsustainable it is, but no one gets blamed for that except the closers. not corporate. its ridiculous",
            "That's how I had to run closes too, with one person on the floor and the other to clean. It felt awful. When our new sm came, I said no more. I told myself I'd rather demote than be a closing shift. Idt there is much of an opener/closing war at my store. If they forget something major at night, I just let the other shift know without involving anyone else. We all kind of just get that it's an inevitable shitshow. Some of the people I work with are amazing, but I can't wait for the day that I find a job that doesn't stress me out the way this dumpster fire does."
