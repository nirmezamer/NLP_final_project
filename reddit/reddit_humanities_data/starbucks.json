            "I feel for everyone working on those days. Customers can be brutal. I think the prices on the drinks have gotten so high now that customers feel entitled to a lot. $7.25 is a lot to spend on a single drink.",
            "I'm not surprised. Starbucks has very unrealistic metrics for the baristas but doesn't support them with adequate staffing. There are endless promotions and endless new drinks to learn. They have to deal with ridiculous customizations from entitled customers. They have to deal with customers who think placing a mobile order means their drink is ready in 5 minutes or pushes their drink ahead of in store and drive through orders\nI don't blame the workers at all. Corporate has fallen far from their core values of providing good coffee, good service (not the baristas' fault), in a good atmosphere. They are now a dessert beverage fast food business.",
            "Holy shit, how many people were on the floor to begin with? And did those three people quit at the same time? BOGO has been hell. Corporate will NOT let us schedule more people because all they care about is money. Maybe if enough people quit and they lose business because of it, they'll finally learn. Not holding out much hope, though.",
            "Had a customer tell me I was rude because I kept asking her \"anything else?\" When she was ordering, she was like why do you keep saying anything else and not let me finish? She's like your rude. All I said was oh. Cause she was pausing each time so I had to pursue her order along like usual with customers",

            "There were only 3 of us scheduled for the bogo today, and we're sooo busy right now that my shift almost cried sending us out onto our lunches. People are being impatient and rude, and there's been yelling from both parties. I'm tired of people thinking that behaving this way is acceptable. This isn't okay, we don't deserve this, and corporate should know better. This is why so many people are quitting, and why the remaining are trying to unionize\n\nIf you're one of the kind ones, we can't appreciate you enough, and we'd probably do anything for you lmao. You don't have to tip, just be human and its enough",
            "It would be different if they weren\u2019t like every damn week it gets ridiculous. it causes rushes at times we normally are slower and have time to do other things, and we don\u2019t have as much staff. If they really wanna bring in customers they should lower the mf prices instead. Today has been soo tiring, im on my last 10 and can\u2019t wait to leave.",

            "Canada doesn't seem to get as many promos as everyone else gets. Customers don't seem to enjoy it but I hope it helps keep the baristas sanity a bit more because holy shit is right.",
            "Yeah the bogos are not fun. I love peak because I love being busy but when you have two peaks in the same shift it\u2019s not amazing. Even with the projected scheduling it\u2019s odd. My sm is awesome and helps out as much as she can but it is still sucky"

One regular got creepy with me and kept asking me out even when I said no, even when I said I was in a relationship. Didn\u2019t mention I was a lesbian, maybe I should have. He actually said at one point \u201cthen why did you put cute drawings on my cup?\u201d and winked at me. Sir, it was a sun \u2600\ufe0f, not a heart with our initials in it. \n\nI got sick of men mistaking me being nice for flirting.
