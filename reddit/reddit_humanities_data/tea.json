And don't worry, no one will make fun of you for what you drink or the questions you ask.\n\nYou can also talk about anything else on your mind, from your specific routine while making tea, or how you've been on an oolong kick lately. Feel free to link to pictures in here, as well. You can even talk about non-tea related topics; maybe you want advice on a guy/gal, or just to talk about life in general.",

            "I tried making a dirty chai with my Teabox Assam masala chai and then a shot of Aeropress, didn't turn out great. Had a little too much coffee to chai and the whole thing came out a little watery.\n\nSo instead I'm brewing up my Okayti spring clonal black which is definitely only black by traditional Indian nomenclature but looks closer to a typical TGY by oxidation levels.\n\nUpdate: brew finished, tastes a lot like a more vegetal TGY. Like you brewed a TGY in green bean water. It's right on the edge of being bitter so I'm glad I didn't follow the instructions on the package and steep for 5 min.",
