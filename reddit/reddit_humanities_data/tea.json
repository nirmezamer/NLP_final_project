And don't worry, no one will make fun of you for what you drink or the questions you ask.\n\nYou can also talk about anything else on your mind, from your specific routine while making tea, or how you've been on an oolong kick lately. Feel free to link to pictures in here, as well. You can even talk about non-tea related topics; maybe you want advice on a guy/gal, or just to talk about life in general.",

This tea is very different from any other black tea I've tasted, and I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but by the third cup it grew on me, and I found myself enjoying the prominence of the lingering tart cherry note that had caught me off guard at first.",
