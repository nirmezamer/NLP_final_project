            "I feel like there was already so much negativity in the discourse surrounding this game after reviews dropped and people started getting their hands on it. Well, I'm just about half way through and I'm puzzled. This game is fucking incredible. It's exactly what Hellblade is. And it takes the experience to a whole new level. \n\nI'm now convinced that everything Microsoft published is going to be under appreciated. There very much appears to be an understanding in games journalism that feeding the hysteria gets more clicks. So they are no help. PlayStation has the biggest voice of gamers, so their negativity surrounding Xbox, the acquisitions, and anything released exclusively on the console ultimately results in a toxic cloud hanging over every game release. But even the Xbox fan base feeds the hysteria if a release isn't \"better than [similar game on PlayStation]\". Because people seem disappointed that Hellblade 2 is like Hellblade 1, rather than the \"better than God of War\" game that they apparently wanted it to be. \n\nBut as a fan of the first game, I'm loving it. And I honestly appreciate the variety in Xbox Game Studios releases. From Psychonauts 2, to Pentiment, to Hi Fi Rush, to Hellblade, and Starfield, there is so much variety that is severely lacking over on PlayStation this generation. Not that I haven't enjoyed games like GoW Ragnarok or Horizon Forbidden West. But there haven't been any games from Sony that actually surprised me this generation or felt like a unique offering within the industry (Returnal being the exception). \n\nI dunno. I think too many people aren't taking the time to truly appreciate some of these games that Microsoft is actually publishing.",

            "From the article, here's the quote on FPS and resolution targets from their yet to be published interview: \n\n>\"Here\u2019s a rough breakdown: The Xbox Series X generally runs in dynamic **2160p (4K)**, while the Xbox Series S usually hovers around **1728p** but can potentially hit 2160p as well. The Xbox One X operates at **1080p**, and the Xbox One S typically runs at around **972p**, though it might reach 1080p on occasion. Across all these platforms, our target is always to hit **60fps**.\"",
            "Nice to see a developer focusing on a 60fps target, no matter what. Even on last gen machines.\n\nI appreciate the attitude. I'm gonna check this one out.",
            "Excited for this game",
            "Actually kinda hyped for this game, will it support crossplay with PC?",
            "Anyone know why it died on pc but everyone is ecstatic it\u2019s going on Xbox?",
            "A team of 5 made this?\n\nThe reviews show good. Yeah I\u2019m down to support this. Console wise it\u2019s exclusive to Xbox too? Nice.",
            "Previously commented I was excited for this game but the more I look into it it seems like a final cash grab the game has been out for a year on PC and it's dead and apparently playing with a controller is awful thankfully I didn't pre order",
            "This looks so fucking cool",
            "Played this game on PC last year. \n\nWas very disappointing. Feels shockingly bad on controller. The upgrade or power weapon system is rough, and most either feel way too underpowered or way over powered. \n\nAlso, the servers were big time dead. Maybe Xbox can spark some life back into it, but I think once people actually play it they won\u2019t stick around.\n\nPicture a really bad feeling halo but as toys. Halo where no matter how hard you try to tweak the sensitivity it all feels terrible.",
