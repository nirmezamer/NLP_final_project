            "From the article, here's the quote on FPS and resolution targets from their yet to be published interview: \n\n>\"Here\u2019s a rough breakdown: The Xbox Series X generally runs in dynamic **2160p (4K)**, while the Xbox Series S usually hovers around **1728p** but can potentially hit 2160p as well. The Xbox One X operates at **1080p**, and the Xbox One S typically runs at around **972p**, though it might reach 1080p on occasion. Across all these platforms, our target is always to hit **60fps**.\"",
            "Nice to see a developer focusing on a 60fps target, no matter what. Even on last gen machines.\n\nI appreciate the attitude. I'm gonna check this one out.",
            "Anyone know why it died on pc but everyone is ecstatic it\u2019s going on Xbox?",
            "Previously commented I was excited for this game but the more I look into it it seems like a final cash grab the game has been out for a year on PC and it's dead and apparently playing with a controller is awful thankfully I didn't pre order",
            "This looks so fucking cool",
            "I'm so looking forward to this one!",
            "I\u2019ve never heard of this game but it sounds interesting",
            "So cool an idea. I wish it had real IPs like GI Joe, Heman, etc",
            "1728p and 60fps on the Xbox Series S is quite a feat. Props to them.\n\nHopefully other devs are taking notes on optimization.",
