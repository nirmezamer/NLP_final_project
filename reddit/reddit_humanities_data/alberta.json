            "Im considering moving from northern BC to Edmonton. Does anyone have insight on what provincial health care covers for type one diabetics? The website was not as concise or easy to navigate as BC pharmacare site. My goal would be to find a job with good extended health but I want to know what the province covers in terms of CGMs, insulin, test strips. I found some info on their insulin pump program. Is there anywhere that I can look at income level and see what coverage/deductible I would be eligible for?",
            "Hello everyone, My husband and I are in our 30s. Im a nurse he is optician we have 2 little girls. We lived in Toronto and now in Brampton. We are done with the city life and traffic. Looking to move to Camrose where its small and all amenities are available. We enjoy nature and we dont mind the drive to edmonton for better shopping, restaurants, movies\n\u00a0Im really excited to improve our quality of life. However whenever I look for houses they arent many options. Are they building more residential areas sometime soon?",
            "Hey Everyone, quick question: As a native French speaker from Qu\u00e9bec, I have this big noticeable accent when speaking English. I might just be worried for nothing, but will have I have any trouble with anyone about my accent? And how would people react if I just suddenly spoke in French? Thank you for any answers :)",
            "My fianc\u00e9e(23) and I(24) are planning on moving to the Edmonton in 2025 from Windsor Ontario. Im currently a general machinist apprentice(I\u2019ll be done next year and going for my journeyman/red seal asap).  My fianc\u00e9e works at TD and has a bachelor in HR. We don\u2019t currently have children and don\u2019t plan on it till a few year into living there, however we do have a cat(bengal) and a dog(dashound). What are some things we should prepare for? We would like to rent for the first few years and then buy a house when right. I do plan on working in the oil sands, but I have some questions about wage. I see a lot of companies hiring for the position I\u2019m looking at applying for, but I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews. Could somebody please let me know what to expect? Greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d",
            "I'm thinking about moving back to Alberta, in the Banff/Canmore/Lake Louise area. I lived in Lake Louise about 10 years ago, but I have 2 cats I'm not willing to give up. I'm applying for cooking jobs. Should I even bother or do some places allow pets in staff accommodation?",

            "I'm a 27 year old single male who's looking to relocate to Alberta from Ontario with my dog also. I am hoping to be there by october pending I can find a decent job that'll get me through the winter. I'm currently looking around the outskirts of Calgary until I get settled after about a year then I'll relocate to something more suitable. What would you recommend for a decent town? I'm currently in the residential concrete and drain industry(liuna union) but would like to get out of it and into pipefitter, ironworker or oil and gas industry. Also open to any other job ideas in the trades. Currently I live in a city/town with around 185k people roughly an hr from Toronto, this is part of the reason why I want out. It's only going to get busier and I'm tired of paying a premium price (house/rent, insurance, high taxes) for a place I can't stand. No kids just me and my dog.",

My husband knows I wear dentures, but I have a few back teeth that will need to be pulled soon and I didn\u2019t want him to know about it just yet. \nMy dentist\u2019s assistant told him my back teeth will need to be pulled and I feel really sad because I wasn\u2019t able to tell him myself. \nAre dental workers allowed to do this? I want to speak to my dentist about it but don\u2019t want to look foolish if they say \u201cyes. You\u2019re married too bad so sad.\u201d \n\nEdit: thanks for all your replies. I love my husband very much, but I also have pride that is my own. I have my own dental plan through my employer. ",

            "The dental assistant shouldn\u2019t have disclosed your health information without your consent. \n\nIt\u2019s not inappropriate to express your concerns and have it noted in your file that you do not want your medical information shared without your consent specifically.",
            "No, this is very much against the Personal Information Protection Act. If the assistant was licensed you can make an official complaint to the College of Alberta Dental Assistants and a complaint against the dentist to the College of Dental Surgeons of Alberta. Both these colleges will have an area on their website to walk you through the complaint.\n\nWith that being said, I doubt the assistant had any malicious intent and probably thought she was being helpful. You are within your right to escalate the complaint to the college but I would maybe speak with the Dentist first and make this a learning opportunity for everyone. I have been in awkward situations similar to this where someone is trying to help advocate treatment for a friend or family member and it's hard to navigate scenarios like this. I am sorry this happened to you and I hope this helps somewhat.",
            "100% a violation. Married or not, they\u2019re not suppose to share that information. I\u2019m not sure if this is covered under PIPA or PIPEDA because they each have their own criteria but it\u2019s still confidential personal medical information. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the process would be for filing a complaint but I feel like it should be going to a government entity.",
            "There is no reason to share information with your husband. Report this person",
            "Generally speaking you would have the right to confidentiality, but if the procedure was pre authorized through your husband\u2019s dental insurance then he would have had access to this information anyway.",
            "This is honestly not a real problem.",
            "No she did not have the right to do that but I urge you to consider whether there was any ill intent there before you pursue any action. Why not just talk to the dental assistant herself and let her know you found what she did inappropriate.",
            "I would bring this up to the dental assistant as a warning for the future.  That next time you will report her.  It sounds like an innocent mistake she made but certainly doesn\u2019t deserve to be fired or suspended over it.  This should have been a common sense thing for her.  As someone who works in healthcare, privacy is drilled through your head numerous times a week.\n\nLook into getting a different dentist in a different office if this still makes you uncomfortable going to this dentist\u2019s office.",
            "(Dental clinic staff here) I feel there isn\u2019t enough info about how it happened. Of course this is embarrassing for you and I\u2019m so sorry about that but typically if you go to any clinic with family members, they make a \u201cfile\u201d for you and it includes spouse and kids there as well. I say there\u2019s not a lot of information as I can\u2019t seem to see how the conversation went? Like the assistant just said it out of the blue? Or your husband asked? If your hubby asked about your treatment plans, I would tell him because i know he\u2019s your spouse and your file has him as spouse and emergency contact and whatnot. I feel if you don\u2019t want to share that information with absolutely ANYONE, you should tell the clinic staff to make a note on your chart about it. Of course if it was a random I wouldn\u2019t disclose any information but that\u2019s your husband. It\u2019s sort of the same thing as if you called to book an appointment or confirm anything related to your husband. The office would disclose that with you because you\u2019re in his file. \n\nTLDR; depending on the scenario, as an assistant myself, I probably would have told the husband too. Tell the staff to note on your chart not to disclose any information about your treatment plans to ANYONE to prevent it happening again.",
            "So yes, personal information, privacy blah, blah, rules etc. \nBut he's also your husband and life partner. Keeping secrets is not a great way to live a life together. Imagine how betrayed he is that you didn't trust him. \nWhile there are laws to protect your privacy, and the dental hygienist should not have shared and I understand you're self-conscious about your dental status, but hiding it from your spouse makes you sound immature and vain. He knows, he kisses you, sis."
