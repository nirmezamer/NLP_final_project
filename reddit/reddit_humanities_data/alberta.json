            "Pasted from a now deleted \u201cmoving here\u201d Calgary or Edmonton?? post. \n\nI grew up in Edmonton and just moved back here after a 2.5 year hiatus in Calgary. \n\n\n\nSafety: Safety is comparable in each city. I\u2019ve been watching the \u201crandom LRT attack\u201d category myself and it seems every time someone is pushed into the rails in Edmonton, someone in Calgary kindly makes the score even. I took transit in both cities and both have open drug use problems, but as a female I was never harassed or bothered by anything other than smoke clouds. \n\nAsian Food: Asian cuisine is very comparable. I\u2019ve had the best Thai food of my life in edmonton, the best Korean food in Calgary, but honestly I probably just didn\u2019t get everywhere. There\u2019s amazing food scenes in both cities. \n\nHousing: Housing is hands down more affordable in Edmonton. \n\nLocal Events: IMO Edmonton is way better for local events particularly outdoor events. We have festivals and art shows all the time!! Edmonton has a very strong local music scene as well (that isn\u2019t country!) However I concur that Calgary clubs are better, and the mountain access is much better (although not in the city so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s fair play). \n\nWalking: Both cities have comparable walking trails and parks, although Edmonton gets the winning title for having their parks being connected by trails, so you can go to the far SW to the far NE without really leaving a shared use path. \n\nBiking: Both have good and growing bike infrastructure; Calgary has more km of bike routes, but Edmonton has committed more dollars to bike investments. See above about Edmontons connected trails. Overall,  comparable.\n\nOverall I wish Edmonton existed where Calgary is on the map. I definitely consider Calgary a good option for me in the future because I love the mountains and the rolling hills, but Edmonton is home for now because I can\u2019t give up the cost of living and the river valley is a perfectly fun outdoor adventure in itself.",
            "I still do not regret about moving to Canada 20 years ago, but I do regret staying in Quebec for far too long. And the recent election results in AB do show that, at least in Canada, it seems to be the most reasonable place. We were looking at AB for last few years, visited a few places there. Overall, the family liked it  - as much as one can like or do not like something in \\~week :)\n\nWe currently live in the suburbs of Montreal. We like the idea of living further away from the big cities. I liked Calgary, but these days the cities seem to be the centres of all bad things, wokism etc. Too left :)\n\nI do want to be able to get to the city in 30-40 minutes of driving, but I want to stay as far as practical. \n\nThe problem is that one of our two kids is still at the age of high school, just started. So we do need a decent high school, safe and with good academic scores. Not necessarily the top, but a decent one. She goes to a private school now. And then she will need to continue the post-secondary education too. Which means that for quite a while we we cannot be too far from civilization :) This is the main dilemma. The universities are only in Edmonton and Calgary, so, it means, they need to be within the reach.\n\nJob-wise, we are both in IT, so, these days, it means any place with decent Internet service will do. I have certainly done my time in the offices ;)\n\nCanmore is a great place, but the real estate is out of reach, IMO. I would need a house for \\~800K or so. We definitely prefer space, not condo living. Not  the indoor space, but rather space around us. When you have good neighbors, but some distance to them :)",
            "I made a post and didn\u2019t notice the megathread until the mods told me. \u201cFirst day in Canada(Edmonton). Starting a new life after leaving an abusive situation. I have questions and I\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re dumb.\n\nI tried posting in the Canada subreddit and was urged to post here instead. Hope that\u2019s ok.\n\nI\u2019m 21, a woman from outside Atlanta, Georgia. and my friend from college moved here for work, as they have dual citizenship. \n\nI left an abusive situation at home and the shelters were full or wouldn\u2019t take me AND my dog. My friend here in Edmonton heard and sent me a ticket and a few bucks for dog food. She\u2019s out of town for work until Thursday, but has a keypad on her apartment and I got in.\n\nI have to hit the ground running tomorrow and she\u2019s really busy at work. I deleted my social media accounts for safety when I was running from him, but feel safe now that I\u2019m in a new country. \n\nI need to apply for a temporary resident permit first, from what I understand, they will probably issue me a 6 month work permit, too. Does anyone know if that\u2019s true?\n\nDoes anyone know what the requirements are to goto the food bank? My friend sent me everything she could and she\u2019s doing so much. The one back home in the us I tried had a bunch of restrictions. Is there a food bank you suggest? I\u2019m nervous about but I\u2019m hungry and my dog is too. Her apartment has no food.\n\nBank account: Will I be able to get a Canadian bank account after I get the TRP approved? Part of the reason my friend here can\u2019t help me until she gets back is that I don\u2019t have a Canadian bank account. She wanted to do an etransfer but it won\u2019t work with my us bank. She couldn\u2019t add a card to PayPal, so she could only send the few bucks in her balance.\n\nWhat restaurant would you apply to in Edmonton if you were me? I have serving experience. Do people tip the same here as the us? What should I ask for in terms of an hourly rate for basic entry level jobs here?\n\nIs there a place in town that assists with clothing for interviews? \n\nAgain, sorry if the questions are dumb.\u201d",
            "Im considering moving from northern BC to Edmonton. Does anyone have insight on what provincial health care covers for type one diabetics? The website was not as concise or easy to navigate as BC pharmacare site. My goal would be to find a job with good extended health but I want to know what the province covers in terms of CGMs, insulin, test strips. I found some info on their insulin pump program. Is there anywhere that I can look at income level and see what coverage/deductible I would be eligible for?",

            "Seeking Scenic Serenity with City Convenience in Alberta \u2013 Which Town Should I Move to?\n\nHey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm on the hunt for the perfect town in Alberta that combines breathtaking scenery with the convenience of being walking distance to shops. As I contemplate a move, I'm eager to hear your recommendations and experiences.\n\nI've always been captivated by Alberta's natural beauty, and I believe that living in a town surrounded by scenic landscapes would be a dream come true. However, I also value the accessibility of local shops and amenities within a leisurely walking distance.\n\nIf you've been lucky enough to find that sweet spot where nature meets convenience, please share your insights! What towns in Alberta strike the right balance between stunning views and a walkable lifestyle?\n\nWhether it's the majestic mountains, serene lakes, or lush greenery that drew you in, I want to know about the towns that have managed to preserve their natural charm while also providing easy access to the essentials. Are there hidden gems that offer the best of both worlds?\n\nAdditionally, if you have any tips on the local community, recreational activities, or unique features that make your chosen town special, please spill the beans. Personal anecdotes and recommendations from the Reddit community could be the key to finding my ideal new home.\n\nI appreciate your input, and I'm excited to learn more about the picturesque and convenient towns Alberta has to offer. Let the recommendations flow!\n\nCheers,",
            "I want to thank everyone in advance for their replies.  I greatly appreciate them all.\n\nI currently live in Saskatchewan with my elderly mother who has dementia.  I'm looking to move to Alberta to be closer to my sister for support in caring for my mother.  Unfortunately, she lives in Cochrane which is very much out of my budget range for apartment rentals.\n\nI hope to find a smaller city or larger town (20,000 or less) within an hour of Cochrane.  My mother would do better in a place that is quiet with less crime and won't be in the flood zones as she is deathly afraid of large bodies of water.  (I know that will be a hard one, but I have to try.)\n\nIt would also be great to find a place with a Walmart or easy access to shopping as travel confuses and upsets my mom, so a self-contained place with shopping, a good hospital and other amenities would be great.  \n\nFor myself, I'm more introverted so a place with an active nightlife isn't a priority.  Instead, I'm looking for photography clubs, writers groups and genealogy groups.  Or any more quiet community programs such as drawing or painting classes.\n\nAlso, I've read through a lot of threads that say many places smell.  I'd like to avoid the worst of it as I have allergies (Asphalt plants in particular are bad for me).\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you. :-D",
            "Calgary, come to S.E  Ogden, Lynndale. Southview, for cheap rents.\n\nForestLawn, Southview - Good cheap food around, 17 Ave SE you get all\u2014burgers AW and MCD, KFC, Tim Hortons, Pizza 73, Dominos, Shawarmas, African Patties, Lot of Cannabis stores, pawn shops, No frills grocery store, Coop, If you go east you can go Walmart in East hills, if you go North you can go to Walmart Marlborough.\n\nSome one asked about scenery..well, you will see lots of humans, cars, trucks with some F Trudeau, police cruisers, fire engines and fire crews sweeping the street of glass shards coolant or administering Naloxone to some guy flapped, some body drove up the concrete barrier and stop sign and took it away with them. But then you can cross deerfoot and go to the park (for got its name) in summer...big place, waterfront, lots of community barbecue stands. We have one public Gym and pool in forest lawn, it has water and shower. The Gym has weights, and paper towels you can use, just bring towel and waterbottle. In 2017 they rebuilt the 17 Ave SE and named it international avenue, but we all still call 17 ave, they put clocks, plants, paintings, like small soapboax places where you can swing a guitar, but be careful of needles, just look before you are sitting.\n\nDont worry about crime, it is there, but overhyped\u2014if you see a homeless person or a druggie, dont be afraid, just smile, I buy them food, but without feeling smug or superior\u2014I buy them especially when I go with my two kids, so that they learn. You need not be rich to be kind to other fellow humans, Maybe one day we ourselves are in street...who knows. Pocket aces dont win preflop 100%\n\nLast resort is Forest Lawn, Forest Heights, Erinwoods, 68 St SE, \n\nOk but cheap - Applewood, Pembroke, Abbeydale, Montery Park, Pineridge\n\nLebanese foods - Rundle and Marlborough, 16 AVE and Barlow  \nEast Asian foods - NE Temple, Falcon Ridge and go North all the way to Redstone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNW, Charleswood, (Triwood community) Briseboise drive for shit-free life.

            "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe are looking into moving to Alberta from Ontario in the next 3-6 months.\n\nI have a daughter who is turning 5 and will be welcoming a baby boy before April.\n\nI (39) work for the public sector (administration) in a small/rural town about 1 hour north of Toronto, where I've resided for the past 3 years (previously in Toronto).\n\nMy husband (38) will be moving with us, he currently works in construction BUT will be attending college (undecided depending on where we're moving to but likely to be online) for computer programming (his previous career in his home country).\n\nMy parents (both retired) will be moving to the same town, but not the same house. They actually will be buying a house in AB as soon as we decide on a place.\n\nWe are looking for a small-ish town, but most importantly, a place that is well-structured and serviced, with hospital, doctor's office, big box stores such Costco and Walmart, restaurants, community centre, etc.\n\nNice weather is SUPER important. My mother is impacted by the lack of sunshine and extreme cold/snow, so we are thinking Southern Alberta or Calgary Region. We've considered Okotoks, Lethbridge, but we are really lost and we would be open to any other places that meet the criteria. My parents are currently visiting Calgary and region and plan on driving to Lethbridge. I would appreciate suggestions of towns/cities they should visit!\n\nGood schools and daycare nearby are really important, as my little one is in JK and I will be rejoining the workforce in September 2025. My husband will probably be working remotely once he finishes school, and while I would love to do the same, it may not be possible. A place with somewhat short commutes would be amazing, and a relatively good job market for admin positions.\n\nGiven that we will be on maternity leave and my husband will be only working part-time (if at all) because of school for 18 months, we need a place that has low cost of living. For comparison, rent for a 3 bed home in our town is around 2800/month (plus utilities, etc). Sale price is a minimum of 750k.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback for a well-structured, family-friendly community with nice weather and decent living costs!\n\nThank you in advance! Please let me know if I omitted any important details.",
            "Hello, I would like some guidance on some cities/towns that may suit our lifestyle. My husband & I are both 30 and are thinking of moving out west from Ontario. We would like a place where we could continue our hobbies: \n\nI play ice hockey & soccer (women\u2019s) and would like to be able to join a league again. I currently work for an auto dealership and could probably find a job doing the same out there. \n\nHe is into the car scene (modifying his own vehicle) & woodworking as a hobby. He is a member of our local carpenters union and would likely look to join a union in Alberta. \n\nWe would like an affordable city/town. We are currently priced out of our own city and could never buy a house here."

If the assistant was licensed you can make an official complaint to the College of Alberta Dental Assistants and a complaint against the dentist to the College of Dental Surgeons of Alberta. Both these colleges will have an area on their website to walk you through the complaint.\n\nWith that being said, I doubt the assistant had any malicious intent and probably thought she was being helpful. You are within your right to escalate the complaint to the college but I would maybe speak with the Dentist first and make this a learning opportunity for everyone. I have been in awkward situations similar to this where someone is trying to help advocate treatment for a friend or family member and it's hard to navigate scenarios like this.

I wouldn\u2019t talk to the assistant directly about it because of how high emotions can get.\n\nIf you are fine changing Dentists to begin with, report the Assistant to the [College of Dental Assistants](https://abrda.ca/protecting-the-public/complaints/). They will then perform an investigation and perform a disciplinary hearing so that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nIf you try to talk to your dentist about it, and they try to blow you off or downplay the situation, then you should report them to the [College of Dental Surgeons](https://www.cdsab.ca/patients-general-public-protection/solving-a-concern/how-to-make-a-complaint/) as well.",

They are physically active but usually don't require as much heavy lifting as factory work.\n\nAs a journeyman electrician I make about $44 an hour (In Alberta). It's rewarding work and pays well. You can start an apprenticeship with minimal upfront cost and figure out if you like the trade just by working. Worst case you don't like the trade and quit but at least you will have learned some generally useful skills regardless.",
            "EMT, healthcare aide, plumber apprentice, dispatcher, join CP or CN. I'd recommend an apprenticeship if you like to work with your hands",
            "Oil field service work as a truck driver.\n\nTrican.\n\nStep.\n\nElement.\n\n^Those are the big boys, but just take a drive through your local industrial parks... anything with \"Well service\" in the company name on the side of a shop is likely hiring.\n\nMost offer decent schedules will pay half or all for class 1 training. \n\nStarting absolute bottom wages are usually ~90k/year.\n\nDoesn't have to be oil field though(just the main one for alberta), truck driving is a legit way of earning a livable income."
