            "The calm/nurturing chefs Carmy learns from prove that you do not have to be mentally abusive in order to impart excellence/wisdom. I think Carmy took something meaningful away from his experiences with each chef, but the mark on him that lingers most is from the most abusive chef. Its a common psychological phenomenon. We generally remember bad service more than we remember good service. This is likely why Carmy bases so much of his menus/methods off of the abusive chef versus the other chefs. Hes determined to gain his abusers approval - much like he craves approval from his abusive mother.",
            "Much like Fletcher in \"Whiplash\" I will never understand why people like him and Chef Winger have to be so hateful to motivate people and further still as we see with Winger's response think that it's justified when it works for them.\n\nBecause while they're not seen I'm certain there are people much worse off then Carmy and Neiman thanks to guys like Winger and Fletcher.",
            "Anyone who's ever been bullied at any point in their life, who has a guy like him who did stuff like that to you (I have one from middle school), all too relatable.\n\nI often wonder what would actually happen if I ever met that human piece of garbage. I even told my therapist not too long ago I'd beat his ass... But in reality, it would probably go something like how it went with Carmy.",
            "I dont think about you like FUCK!",
            "I think about you a lot ",
            "I WAS ALSO SCREAMING, I WAS ANGRY, I WAS ANXIOUS I WANTED TO CRY BECAUSE IT FELT SO REAL LIKE THIS GUY ACTUALLY HURT ANOTHER PERSON TO THIS POINT AND DIDN'T CARE AND CARMY HAD TO SUFFER SO MUCH!.",
            "I'm sure there's a compelling way to do it, but I've now seen two of these \"confront your abusive 'ex' and they don't care\" scenes in shows I otherwise like. I think part of the problem is that in both cases, the scenes didn't move anything forward - they didn't result in any epiphanies or even a satisfying moment of catharsis. \n\nI know it's something that happens in real life, and that's the point, that you don't always triumph over your abuser when you confront them, and I could see it done well in a book, but it just doesn't translate well (for me) to screen.",
            "Honestly, I kind of had to agree with Chef Winger, as much of a dick as he is. Without him Carmy would probably be less fucked up, but also probably not as good as he is now.",
            "I can't stand that line from twitter whenever a fan *fans*",
            "There are wonderful scenes where Syd is the calm, nurturing chef for Tina when shes in the shits. Carmy looks on knowingly."

        "content": "Yes, both seasons 1 and 2 were heavy but I lived through them. Season 3 messed with my head. It's because of the way it's edited and we get a glimpse of what goes on inside Carmy's head. \n\nThat's exactly what it's like. They portrayed PTSD and panic attacks and just surviving one day after the other very acutely. The anger flashes, the inability to communicate, how hard it is to pick up the phone to say sorry. \n\nNot everyone loved this season as much as 1 and 2. But man, o man, if this season makes at least one person develop more empathy for those who are struggling, then it's the best season ever. \n\n",

            "I have a love hate relationship with this show. Its far too relatable. Season 3 brought that into focus for me. I can identify with damn near every character in some way and it hurts me, because Im been through so many of those struggles. Too many tears.",
            "I really liked Tina's episode. She's one of my favourites and to see all her struggle before meeting Mike made me sob along her. It felt so real, the way women at certain age just seem to not be of use in this world anymore. I really liked her conversation with Mike; I felt I was part of that. \"I'll give anything to be one of those motherfuckers\".",
            "You need therapy?! Carmy needs TRAUMA therapy BAD.\n\nI work in mental health, this may be one of the best illustrations of complex trauma in a person ever put to screen. Not even being hyperbolic.",
            "Season 3 was the first time I truly felt uncomfortable. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder and sometimes depression largely due to an abusive childhood and marriage. Ive been under the care of a psychiatrist for years now which is the only way I made it through the last few years. I sincerely hope they show Carmy getting professional help. I love seeing the stigma being taken off seeking help for emotional issues, and the odds of healing from his emotional trauma on his own isnt very likely. Sugar was able to break the cycle. Im rooting hard for Carmy to do the same.",
            "As a therapist, who also happens to have PTSD, I related to a lot of this. I get the time jumps were confusing to many. But that's also how PTSD is sometimes. One minute I'm living in 2024 as a 36 year old, married, stable woman. Another minute... I'm 13 on the side of the road left for dead. In addition to being a therapist, I'm also a chef and own three culinary businesses (and a farm), so it's extra \"on the nose\" for me. I don't have anger issues. Inability to communicate when a flashback comes on, yes. Temporarily. We're talking like \"I need 30 seconds.\" I usually don't have to pick up the phone to say sorry. Sometimes it's just I have to pick up the phone. My best friend also has PTSD, and she knows that sometimes we both need to just dive into our work and focus on our self health. So if we don't hear from each other for a bit, it doesn't mean we don't care. Its means we're focusing on what we need to. Been besties since high school and I'm lucky to have someone who just gets it. Ironically, she is a baker and she works at one of my businesses. I know a lot of people are hating on the season, but I'll say they got a lot right about PTSD as well as being a chef.",
            "It made me feel empathetic for Donna.",
            "Theres days im on the line at work, slammed getting railed, and im in a flow state. Then i bend down to reach into my pasta cooler, and i get flashes of my ex's Dad in the hospital, then, its her telling me she loves in the morning, then its her saying \"dont contact me\" all of this and more flash into my head in a split second. Then i breathe, stand up, and im back making pasta again with the tickets flooding in. Carmy is a super relatable character for me this season.",
            "Carmy is a psychological toxic waste dump and  Sydney deserves much better no matter how heartbreaking it is for her to leave.",
            "The theme of hurt people hurt people was perfectly done.",
            "I absofuckinglutely agree with you. It's already a minute of me watching just the first episode and I love how they potrayed carmy's journey from absolute getting bashed at work to grief to anxiety and fucking start all over. I think it is an abode to all the triers of the world. And what's between trying and failing and everything in between is so apt as you put it out here!"
