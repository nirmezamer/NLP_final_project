            "The calm/nurturing chefs Carmy learns from prove that you do not have to be mentally abusive in order to impart excellence/wisdom. I think Carmy took something meaningful away from his experiences with each chef, but the mark on him that lingers most is from the most abusive chef. It\u2019s a common psychological phenomenon. We generally remember bad service more than we remember good service. This is likely why Carmy bases so much of his menus/methods off of the abusive chef versus the other chefs. He\u2019s determined to gain his abuser\u2019s approval - much like he craves approval from his abusive mother.",
            "Much like Fletcher in \"Whiplash\" I will never understand why people like him and Chef Winger have to be so hateful to motivate people and further still as we see with Winger's response think that it's justified when it works for them.\n\nBecause while they're not seen I'm certain there are people much worse off then Carmy and Neiman thanks to guys like Winger and Fletcher.",
            "[Me right after that scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEsKIM9MZnE)\n\n\nWhen Carmy said \"I thought of you\", I immediately thought of Joel McHales response.... then he said it\n\n\nWhat did ya expect Carmy?!",
            "This will probably be an unpopular opinion, but I kind of felt the writing for that dialogue was a bit ... off? Not sure if it's just me. The Bear is a show that (rightly) prides itself in the realism & sense of the ordinary it brings to its scenes & writing. That element was just missing for me here. The kind of development of the conversation seemed contrived & the emotions didn't read as organic to me. I just wasn't as involved or immersed as I normally would in a scene like this.\n\nMiles apart from the Donna & Nat scene in Ice Chips. That shit got me.\n\nBut hey, could just be me.",
            "Anyone who's ever been bullied at any point in their life, who has a guy like him who did stuff like that to you (I have one from middle school), all too relatable.\n\nI often wonder what would actually happen if I ever met that human piece of garbage. I even told my therapist not too long ago I'd beat his ass... But in reality, it would probably go something like how it went with Carmy.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t think about you\u201d like FUCK!",
            "I had an abusive boss, and I often think about what I'd say to her if I ever saw her again.\n\nThat scene felt so real to me. Just that feeling of being blinded by hatred for a shitty human being so much that you can't even articulate how badly this person made you feel.\n\nHey S, fuck you. Fuck your constant belittling, fuck your constant undermining of any stability I felt. Fuck you for writing STAY IN YOUR FUCKING LANE to me in a DM because I dared to have a conversation with someone elsewhere in the company. Fuck you for making me feel guilty about talking to someone else within the company about a different job. Fuck your gaslighting, fuck your screwing with my paternity leave for my firstborn. Fuck you trying to screw me out of my raise. Fuck you for lying about writing me up for a made up bullshit reason. Fuck you for making me so scared I got into a car accident rushing to get dinner because I couldn't risk missing a random Slack message from you. Fuck you for making me do a pointless task on my last day 10 minutes before my shift ended because you wanted to make sure I was still in the office. Fuck you for belittling me in front of my coworkers. Fuck you for making fun of the accomodations I needed to function in that shitty office. Fuck you for the PTSD I have now.\n\nI literally danced in the office when you lost your job. I'll have a fucking party when I read your obituary.",
            "I can't stand that line from twitter whenever a fan *fans*",
            "Honestly, I kind of had to agree with Chef Winger, as much of a dick as he is. Without him Carmy would probably be less fucked up, but also probably not as good as he is now.",
            "I'm sure there's a compelling way to do it, but I've now seen two of these \"confront your abusive 'ex' and they don't care\" scenes in shows I otherwise like. I think part of the problem is that in both cases, the scenes didn't move anything forward - they didn't result in any epiphanies or even a satisfying moment of catharsis. \n\nI know it's something that happens in real life, and that's the point, that you don't always triumph over your abuser when you confront them, and I could see it done well in a book, but it just doesn't translate well (for me) to screen."

        "content": "Yes, both seasons 1 and 2 were heavy but I lived through them. Season 3 messed with my head. It's because of the way it's edited and we get a glimpse of what goes on inside Carmy's head. \n\nThat's exactly what it's like. They portrayed PTSD and panic attacks and just surviving one day after the other very acutely. The anger flashes, the inability to communicate, how hard it is to pick up the phone to say sorry. \n\nNot everyone loved this season as much as 1 and 2. But man, o man, if this season makes at least one person develop more empathy for those who are struggling, then it's the best season ever. \n\n",

            "I have a love hate relationship with this show. It\u2019s far too relatable. Season 3 brought that into focus for me. I can identify with damn near every character in some way and it hurts me, because I\u2019m been through so many of those struggles. Too many tears.",
            "I really liked Tina's episode. She's one of my favourites and to see all her struggle before meeting Mike made me sob along her. It felt so real, the way women at certain age just seem to not be of use in this world anymore. I really liked her conversation with Mike; I felt I was part of that. \"I'll give anything to be one of those motherfuckers\".",
            "As a therapist, who also happens to have PTSD, I related to a lot of this. I get the time jumps were confusing to many. But that's also how PTSD is sometimes. One minute I'm living in 2024 as a 36 year old, married, stable woman. Another minute... I'm 13 on the side of the road left for dead. In addition to being a therapist, I'm also a chef and own three culinary businesses (and a farm), so it's extra \"on the nose\" for me. I don't have anger issues. Inability to communicate when a flashback comes on, yes. Temporarily. We're talking like \"I need 30 seconds.\" I usually don't have to pick up the phone to say sorry. Sometimes it's just I have to pick up the phone. My best friend also has PTSD, and she knows that sometimes we both need to just dive into our work and focus on our self health. So if we don't hear from each other for a bit, it doesn't mean we don't care. Its means we're focusing on what we need to. Been besties since high school and I'm lucky to have someone who just gets it. Ironically, she is a baker and she works at one of my businesses. I know a lot of people are hating on the season, but I'll say they got a lot right about PTSD as well as being a chef.",
            "Season 3 was the first time I truly felt uncomfortable. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder and sometimes depression largely due to an abusive childhood and marriage. I\u2019ve been under the care of a psychiatrist for years now which is the only way I made it through the last few years. I sincerely hope they show Carmy getting professional help. I love seeing the stigma being taken off seeking help for emotional issues, and the odds of healing from his emotional trauma on his own isn\u2019t very likely. Sugar was able to break the cycle. I\u2019m rooting hard for Carmy to do the same.",
            "It made me feel empathetic for Donna.",
            "You need therapy?! Carmy needs TRAUMA therapy BAD.\n\nI work in mental health, this may be one of the best illustrations of complex trauma in a person ever put to screen. Not even being hyperbolic.",
            "The first two episodes are borderline unwatchable. I don\u2019t think I like this show anymore.",
            "Yeah, this was a rough watch for me. Too intense for too long, imo. Hardly any relief valves throughout 10 episodes, oof! \n\nThey better be working on the sweetest, most positive and satisfying 4th season. It felt like an extended Fishes episode at times, they should owe us for emotional distress. \ud83d\ude02",
            "I binged watched S3 in one day. I feel like I am having a full meltdown. It feels unrecoverable. The Every Second Counts sign coming down was heartbreaking. I need my own walk-in for the tears and screams. The vulnerability of Ice Chips and Napkins. I felt angry, sad, scared, lonely. So many feels. The writing and acting are so intensely amazing.\n\nI actually have the Every Second Counts hanging up at work. Some people get it and some don't but it is about more than just a nod to the Bear.",
            "Carmy is a psychological toxic waste dump and  Sydney deserves much better no matter how heartbreaking it is for her to leave."
