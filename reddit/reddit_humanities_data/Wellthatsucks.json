There is a reason theyre so cheap, now. Invest in a steering wheel lock or trade it in. It sucks, yes, but Hyundai has no real interest in providing current owners with a solution. Anyone with a Kia or Hyundai that fits the above description will be a target for the Kia Boys, in perpetuity. It is *incredibly* easy to replicate.",
