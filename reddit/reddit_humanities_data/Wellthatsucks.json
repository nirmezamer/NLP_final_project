You can get a room at a Marriot or Hilton for cheaper than this and its guaranteed to be clean, with no funny business. Or just do a Courtyard Inn and get a free breakfast at least.\n\nHave no idea how people continue to use AirBnB with these kind of exorbitant fees.\n\n50% tax is stupid enough. A service fee just so AirBnB gets their cut, and then a 350% host fee????????????????? What the actual fuck,.",

            "One morning a few years ago I was walking to my car to go to work when I saw what looked like money blowing down the middle of my street. I grabbed it and it was a $100 bill, so I was of course stoked. I put it in my pocket and drove away. At work I pulled it out to show off to my coworkers my good fortune, when I saw some Chinese writing on it, Google Translate told me it said \"play money\" or something like that. So then I was sad, but whatever. It ended up in my car, in a little cubby under the stereo. Fast forward a month or so and I met up with a friend who was going through some hard times. She lived about 2 hours away from me- she had lost her job and she and her son were on the brink of homelessness, so I took them out to lunch, bought them a bag of groceries and supplies, and then I drove us to a park so her kid could play and just be a kid. She mentioned to me that she had left something in my car and she would be right back. No problem. After a while I had to get rolling home so we packed up and we drove to a hotel and I paid for a room for two nights, we said our goodbyes and I left. A couple of days later I was looking for something in my car when I noticed that the fake $100 was gone. She had obviously seen it, and when she excused herself to go back to my car she pinched it. At first I was worried that she would try to spend it and get in trouble, or at least get hassled, but then I realized- after all of my friendship, support, and goodwill, she still stole money from me, whether it was bogus money or not. I haven't spoken to her since.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu8fkovr5z7d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92a3253d4bd4e32c0614075c10f458a89a39b3e8"
