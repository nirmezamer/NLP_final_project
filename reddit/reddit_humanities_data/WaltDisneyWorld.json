        "content": "Hi, folks! [Opening day](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/tianas-bayou-adventure/#:~:text=This%20musical%20adventure%20crescendos%20with,Resort%20on%20June%2028%2C%202024) is finally upon us!\n\nThere\u2019s understandably a lot of excitement and buzz around this, so we\u2019re designating this as our de facto Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure megathread for the time being.\n\nWhile we may allow a select few standalone posts on the sub, all questions, commentary, etc. related to the new attraction should go in this thread.\n\nPlease see megathreads [Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/2zGVkziffi) and [Pt. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/WJQxOruf8D) for prior discussions during the attraction\u2019s preview phase.",

            "Please be aware that discussions about this attraction (and its predecessor) have frequently become very heated.\n\nWe will therefore be limiting discussion to Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure only, as with past megathreads on this topic.\n\nWhile we understand many of us will always miss Splash Mountain, the time to debate its merits, shortcomings, and fate have passed \u2014 and, frankly, it generates dozens of vitriolic comments and attracts brigading by internet \u201cculture warriors\u201d each time it comes up on the sub.\n\nThanks for your understanding, and enjoy the new attraction! :)",
            "Reall cute overlay with a lot of ton of fun show scenes, but I just gotta laugh that Disney didn't put a deep frier or frying pan in the queue kitchenette.\n\n\nWhich begs the question; is she baking those begniets?",
            "How long is this likely to remain on Virtual Queue? Really getting sick of travelling so far and then having to play a lottery to get on the good rides.\n\nWe're going to be at WDW from August 26th to September 7th this year, and wondered what the likelihood of Tiana coming off VQ by then is \u2013 their wording of 'we plan to open a standby queue shortly after opening day' gives me some hope we might just be able to good old-fashioned rope drop it.\n\nThen again, GOTG is still VQ two years down the line, so who knows?",
            "I tried at 7am and 1pm to try to get on the ride. I did it the exact second it turned 7 and 1 and it said it was full. Rip",
            "Can you buy an individual lightning lane for it?",
            "Sooo excited this ride is finally open. Do y'all think it will be taken off Virtual Que by August or September. Disney said it won't be on virtual for long.",
            "I have seen speculation that it will end on July 24th when the Multi-Pass changes take effect, but nothing confirmed.",
            "Splash/Tiana is a people-eater attraction, unlike both Guardians and TRON. If they can't get over the downtime issues, I think it might stay VQ longer than expected. But, otherwise, I bet they'll get rid of it at the end of the \"summer season\". (Either July 22nd or August 5th.)",
            "Did you use an atomic clock app to make sure the clock on your phone is accurate? I get a spot in the VQs every single time.",
            "No. It's on Genie+, though. The only ILL rides at MK are TRON and 7DMT."

            "Going to Mickeys not so scary. If I want to ride Tron at night that day, I\u2019m guessing the only way to ride it would be to use the 6pm VQ. For those who went last year, does the VQ go pretty quick? I\u2019ll definitely get the ILL for it but would rather guarantee two rides during the day compared to missing out on the second ride. Going Aug 27th so shouldn\u2019t be a crazy busy party.",
            "Hoping to park hop to EPCOT during our trip for extended evening hours. A virtual queue for Guardians will open at 6 PM for this. \n\nDo we need to have been in EPCOT at all on this day in order to join the queue? Looking like we might be at AK prior.\n\nLike I said, we\u2019ll have park hoppers and I\u2019m just trying to make sure we don\u2019t miss out when it gets to 6 PM.\n\nThank you!",
            "I'm looking at getting the discounted Magicbands from a resort stay and the cheapest ones are $25. Every website I look at says you can get them for $10. I know stock changes frequently on them, should I keep checking on it to see if any $10 ones show up? I'm not needing anything fancy, I want to get some for my kids since this will be their first trip and I want them to feel special!",
            "What is the wait time for Flight of Passage like at 8:00/8:30 AM with early access opening at 7:30? I don\u2019t have early access to the park, but I want to try to get to FoP as soon as the park opens to everyone. \n\nAlso, when I see people talk about rope drop, is that usually referencing early access? Or public open?",
            "Does anyone know if the \"do a DVC tour, get a $200 gift card\" promo is still happening and what the easiest way to get in on it is? Staying at Yacht Club tonight and will probably have some downtime tomorrow afternoon.",
            "Is Undercover Tourist a good place to book a WDW hotel?",
            "\n\nPlanning our first WDW trip as parents, with our five year old. I very much appreciate all the kind comments and advice from others here still masking at the parks. We\u2019re trying to go in off season to avoid crowds, will mask indoors and in any really packed outdoor spaces, and only dine outdoors. \n\nMy questions are about the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique and character dining experiences. For BBB, could most of that still be enjoyed masked? Thinking she could do most of it with a mask on and take it off for final pictures but have never done it so I\u2019m not sure. \n\nI\u2019ve tried searching and it seems like there are not any character meals that offer outdoor seating - any one who knows the parks better able to confirm that? \n\nShe\u2019ll still have a wonderful time without either of these experiences, but wanted to try and figure out if they\u2019re on the table for our family. \n\nThank you!",

(We want to use a card that only has swipe no chip or Disney gift cards)\n\n\nWould they take Disney gift cards as checkout/buying food?\n\n\nCan we use the Disney app to top up w Disney gift card to use in Disney park?",
            "I\u2019m kind of bummed out that the new multi pass system doesn\u2019t seem to include any meet and greets or things like Enchanted Tales with Belle. I was planning to use lightning lanes for those when I visited with my kindergartener next January."
