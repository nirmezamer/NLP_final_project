[Opening day](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/tianas-bayou-adventure/#:~:text=This%20musical%20adventure%20crescendos%20with,Resort%20on%20June%2028%2C%202024) is finally upon us!\n\nThere\u2019s understandably a lot of excitement and buzz around this, so we\u2019re designating this as our de facto Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure megathread for the time being.\n\nWhile we may allow a select few standalone posts on the sub, all questions, commentary, etc. related to the new attraction should go in this thread.\n\nPlease see megathreads [Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/2zGVkziffi) and [Pt. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/s/WJQxOruf8D) for prior discussions during the attraction\u2019s preview phase.",

            "I tried at 7am and 1pm to try to get on the ride. I did it the exact second it turned 7 and 1 and it said it was full. Rip",
            "Can you buy an individual lightning lane for it?",
            "Sooo excited this ride is finally open. Do y'all think it will be taken off Virtual Que by August or September. Disney said it won't be on virtual for long.",
            "I have seen speculation that it will end on July 24th when the Multi-Pass changes take effect, but nothing confirmed.",
            "Splash/Tiana is a people-eater attraction, unlike both Guardians and TRON. If they can't get over the downtime issues, I think it might stay VQ longer than expected. But, otherwise, I bet they'll get rid of it at the end of the \"summer season\". (Either July 22nd or August 5th.)",
            "Did you use an atomic clock app to make sure the clock on your phone is accurate? I get a spot in the VQs every single time.",
            "No. It's on Genie+, though. The only ILL rides at MK are TRON and 7DMT.",
            "The speculation is that it'll go off VQ when the LL system changes (July 24th) although that is just speculation, there's no evidence afaik.\n\nThe main thing is that they'll likely be complaints about having two rides in one park on VQ and the fact you can't be in two VQs at once, so it's possible you won't be able to VQ both in one day between the two VQ openings (say you got a 7am VQ for Tiana but your group is called after the 1pm- then there's no possibility you can get on Tron within regular hours without paying for the ILL) so I honestly don't expect it to be on VQ more than a month or two because of that. Splash used to eat a big amount of people between the queue being able to hold a lot and a good throughput so I think they'll want to take it off VQ because of that too. It seems they fixed the issue that was causing the frequent breakdowns during previews (apparently a sensor issue) because I've not heard that it had those breakdowns today, but correct me if I'm wrong.",
            "So you can get (what used to be a normal FP+) Genie+ spot for it?\n\nDoes anyone know how bad the lines have been of late?",
            "Thank you! Ill be there for two days and going to MNSSHP in mid-August so hopefully theyll add it back to after hours events. They took it off recently. "

            "Going to Mickeys not so scary. If I want to ride Tron at night that day, Im guessing the only way to ride it would be to use the 6pm VQ. For those who went last year, does the VQ go pretty quick? Ill definitely get the ILL for it but would rather guarantee two rides during the day compared to missing out on the second ride. Going Aug 27th so shouldnt be a crazy busy party.",
            "I'm looking at getting the discounted Magicbands from a resort stay and the cheapest ones are $25. Every website I look at says you can get them for $10. I know stock changes frequently on them, should I keep checking on it to see if any $10 ones show up? I'm not needing anything fancy, I want to get some for my kids since this will be their first trip and I want them to feel special!",
            "What is the wait time for Flight of Passage like at 8:00/8:30 AM with early access opening at 7:30? I dont have early access to the park, but I want to try to get to FoP as soon as the park opens to everyone. \n\nAlso, when I see people talk about rope drop, is that usually referencing early access? Or public open?",
